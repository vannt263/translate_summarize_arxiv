    "the hydrogen atom played the pivotal role in the development of quantum mechanics .",
    "its discrete energy levels led to the concept of a localization condition for the probability distribution , and thus to the bound - state picture of quantum mechanics .",
    "likewise , the quark model is still playing the central role in high - energy physics  @xcite . in this model",
    ", hadrons are bound states of more fundamental particles called``quarks '' with their own internal quantum numbers , such as isospins , unitary spins , and then flavors .",
    "thus , the symmetry of combining these quantum numbers has been and still is an important branch of physics . unlike the proton and electron in the hydrogen atom , quarks have never been observed as free particles .",
    "they are always confined inside the hadron .",
    "thus the only way of determining their properties is through observing the symmetry properties of hadrons .    then there comes the question of the binding forces between them , and the dynamics governing those forces .",
    "if the hadrons are assumed to be quantum bound states , there are localized probability distributions whose boundary conditions generate discrete mass spectra .",
    "this aspect of quantum mechanics is well known . on the other hand , it is not yet completely clear how the localized probability distribution would look to observers in different lorentz frames .",
    "protons coming from high - energy accelerators are quantum bound states seen in a lorentz frame moving very fast with respect to their rest frame .",
    "this is the question on which we would like to concentrate in this review paper .",
    "there are then three steps .",
    "first , we have to assemble the physical principles needed to construct this scheme",
    ". we shall need space - time transformation laws of special relativity and uncertainty principles of quantum mechanics applicable to position and momentum variables .",
    "since we are interested in constructing a lorentz - covariant theory , we need the time - energy uncertainty relation .",
    "however , this time - energy relation does not allow excited states , and has to be treated differently .",
    "this is the first hurdle we have to overcome .",
    "the second step is to construct a mathematical formalism which will accommodate all the physical conditions presented in the first step .",
    "as always , harmonic oscillators serve as test models for all new theories .",
    "we shall construct a formalism based on harmonic oscillators , whose wave functions satisfy lorentz - covariant boundary conditions , orthogonality conditions , the difference between position - momentum and time - energy uncertainty relations .",
    "this covariant oscillator formalism will satisfy all physical laws of quantum mechanics and special relativity .",
    "the third step is to see whether the theory tells the story of the real world . for this purpose ,",
    "we discuss in detail the proton form factors and feynman s parton picture  @xcite .",
    "indeed , it has been the most outstanding issue in high energy physics whether the quark model and parton model are two different limiting cases of one lorentz - covariant entity .",
    "we examine this issue in detail .",
    "this review paper is largely based on the papers published by the present authors .",
    "but we are not the first ones to approach the difficult problem of constructing a lorentz - covariant picture of quantum bound states .",
    "indeed , this problem was recognized earlier by dirac , wigner , and feynman .",
    "we shall present a review of their valiant efforts in this direction .",
    "these great physicists constructed big lakes .",
    "we are connecting these lakes to construct a canal leading to an understanding of relativistic bound states applicable to the quark model and the parton model .",
    "einstein was against the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics .",
    "why was he so against it ?",
    "the present form of quantum mechanics is regarded as unsatisfactory because of its probabilistic interpretation . at the same time",
    ", it is unsatisfactory because it does not appear to be lorentz - covariant .",
    "we still do not know how the hydrogen atom appears to a moving observer .",
    "while relativity was einstein s main domain of interest , why did he not complain about the lack of lorentz covariance ?",
    "it is possible that einstein was too modest to mention relativity , and instead concentrated his complaint against its probabilistic interpretation .",
    "it is also possible that einstein did not want to send his most valuable physics asset to a battle ground .",
    "we can not find a definite answer to this question , but it is gratifying to note that the present authors are not the first ones to question whether the copenhagen school of thought is consistent with the concept of relativity  @xcite .",
    "paul a. m. dirac was never completely happy with the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics , but he thought it was a necessary temporary step . in that case , he thought we should examine whether quantum mechanics is consistent with special relativity .",
    "as for combining quantum mechanics with special relativity , there was a giant step forward with the construction of the present form of quantum field theory .",
    "it leads to a lorentz covariant s - matrix which enables us to calculate scattering amplitudes using feynman diagrams .",
    "however , we can not solve bound - state problems or localized probability distributions using feynman diagrams  @xcite .",
    "dirac was never happy with the present form of field theory  @xcite , particularly with infinite quantities in its renormalization processes .",
    "furthermore , field theory never addresses the issue of localized probability .",
    "indeed , dirac concentrated his efforts on determining whether localized probability distribution is consistent with lorentz covariance .    in 1927",
    "@xcite , dirac noted that there is a time - energy uncertainty relation without time - like excitations .",
    "he pointed out that this space - time asymmetry causes a difficulty in combining quantum mechanics with special relativity .    in 1945",
    "@xcite , dirac constructed four - dimensional harmonic oscillator wave functions including the time variable .",
    "his oscillator wave functions took a normalizable gaussian form , but he did not attempt to give a physical interpretation to this mathematical device .    in 1949  @xcite , dirac emphasized that the task of building a relativistic quantum mechanics is equivalent to constructing a representation of the poincar group .",
    "he then pointed out difficulties in constructing such a representation .",
    "he also introduced the light - cone coordinate system .    in 1963  @xcite , dirac used two coupled oscillators to construct a representation of the @xmath0 desitter group which later became the basic mathematics for two - photon coherent states known as squeezed states of light  @xcite .    in this paper , we combine all of these works by dirac to make the present form of uncertainty relations consistent with special relativity .",
    "once this task is complete , we can start examining whether the probability interpretation is ultimately valid for quantum mechanics .",
    "we then use this lorentz - covariant model to understand the relativistic aspect of the quark model .",
    "the most outstanding problem is whether the quark model and the parton model can be combined into one lorentz - covariant model , as in the case of einstein s energy - momentum relation @xmath1 valid for all values of @xmath2    we know that the quark model is valid for small values of @xmath2 we consider feynman s parton picture for the limit of large @xmath3 .",
    "we then consider the proton proton form factor for @xmath3 between these two limiting cases .    in sec .",
    "[ dirac11 ] , we review four of dirac s major papers by giving graphical illustrations .",
    "section  [ dirac22 ] is devoted to combining all four of dirac s papers into one lorentz covariant model for quantum bound states . in sec .",
    "[ quarkmo ] , we discuss the parton model and the proton form factor to show that the model is consistent with what we observe in high - energy laboratories .",
    "paul a. m. dirac made it his lifelong effort to formulate quantum mechanics so that it would be consistent with special relativity . in this section ,",
    "we review four of his major papers on this subject . in each of these papers ,",
    "dirac points out fundamental difficulties in this problem .    in 1927",
    "@xcite , dirac notes that there is an uncertainty relation between the time and energy variables which manifests itself in emission of photons from atoms .",
    "he notes further that there are no excitations along the time or energy axis , unlike heisenberg s uncertainty relation which allows quantum excitations .",
    "thus , there is a serious difficulty in combining these relations in the lorentz- covariant world .    in 1945",
    "@xcite , dirac considers the four - dimensional harmonic oscillator and attempts to construct a representation of the lorentz group using the oscillator wave functions .",
    "however , he ends up with the wave functions which do not appear to be lorentz - covariant .    in 1949",
    "@xcite , dirac considers three forms of relativistic dynamics which can be constructed from the ten generators of the poincar group .",
    "he then imposes subsidiary conditions necessitated by the existing form of quantum mechanics . in so doing",
    ", he ends up with inconsistencies in all three of the cases he considers .    in 1963",
    "@xcite , he constructed a representation of the @xmath0 desitter group using coupled harmonic oscillators .",
    "using step - up and step - down operators , he constructs a beautiful algebra , but he makes no attempts to exploit the physical contents of his algebra .    in spite of the shortcomings mentioned above , it is indeed remarkable that dirac worked so tirelessly on this important subject .",
    "we are interested in combining all of his works to achieve his goal of making quantum mechanics consistent with special relativity .",
    "let us review the contents of these papers in detail , by transforming dirac s formulas into geometrical figures .",
    "even before heisenberg formulated his uncertainty principle in 1927 , dirac studied the uncertainty relation applicable to the time and energy variables  @xcite .",
    "this time - energy uncertainty relation was known before 1927 from the transition time and line broadening in atomic spectroscopy .",
    "as soon as heisenberg formulated his uncertainty relation , dirac considered whether the two uncertainty relations could be combined to form a lorentz covariant uncertainty relation  @xcite .",
    "he noted one major difficulty .",
    "there are excitations along the space - like longitudinal direction starting from the position - momentum uncertainty , while there are no excitations along the time - like direction .",
    "the time variable is a c - number .",
    "how then can this space - time asymmetry be made consistent with lorentz covariance , where the space and time coordinates are mixed up for moving observers .",
    "heisenberg s uncertainty relation is applicable to space separation variables .",
    "for instance , the bohr radius measures the difference between the proton and electron .",
    "dirac never addressed the question of the separation in time variable or the time interval even in his later papers .",
    "as for the space - time asymmetry , dirac came back to this question in his 1949 paper  @xcite where he discusses the `` instant form '' of relativistic dynamics .",
    "he talks indirectly about the possibility of freezing three of the six parameters of the lorentz group , and thus working only with the remaining free parameters .",
    "this idea was presented earlier by wigner  @xcite who observed that the internal space - time symmetries of particles are dictated by his little groups with three independent parameters .          during world war",
    "ii , dirac was looking into the possibility of constructing representations of the lorentz group using harmonic oscillator wave functions  @xcite .",
    "the lorentz group is the language of special relativity , and the present form of quantum mechanics starts with harmonic oscillators .",
    "therefore , he was interested in making quantum mechanics lorentz - covariant by constructing representations of the lorentz group using harmonic oscillators .    in his 1945 paper  @xcite , dirac considers the gaussian form @xmath4 we note that this gaussian form is in the @xmath5 coordinate variables .",
    "thus , if we consider a lorentz boost along the @xmath6 direction , we can drop the @xmath7 and @xmath8 variables , and write the above equation as @xmath9 this is a strange expression for those who believe in lorentz invariance where @xmath10 is an invariant quantity .    on the other hand ,",
    "this expression is consistent with his earlier papers on the time - energy uncertainty relation  @xcite . in those papers",
    ", dirac observed that there is a time - energy uncertainty relation , while there are no excitations along the time axis .",
    "let us look at fig .",
    "[ diracf27 ] carefully .",
    "this figure is a pictorial representation of dirac s eq.([ground ] ) , with localization in both space and time coordinates .",
    "then dirac s fundamental question would be how to make this figure covariant ?",
    "this question is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ diracf45 ] .",
    "this is where dirac stops .",
    "however , this is not the end of the dirac story .          in 1949 ,",
    "the reviews of modern physics published a special issue to celebrate einstein s 70th birthday .",
    "this issue contains dirac paper entitled `` forms of relativistic dynamics ''  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", he introduced his light - cone coordinate system , in which a lorentz boost becomes a squeeze transformation , where one axis expands while the other contracts in such a way that their product remains invariant .    when the system is boosted along the @xmath6 direction",
    ", the transformation takes the form @xmath11    this is not a rotation , and people still feel strange about this form of transformation . in 1949",
    "@xcite , dirac introduced his light - cone variables defined as  @xcite @xmath12 the boost transformation of eq.([boostm ] ) takes the form @xmath13 the @xmath14 variable becomes expanded while the @xmath15 variable becomes contracted , as is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ diracf49 ] .",
    "their product @xmath16 remains invariant .",
    "indeed , in dirac s picture , the lorentz boost is a squeeze transformation .      .",
    "]    in 1963  @xcite , dirac published a paper on symmetries of coupled harmonic oscillators .",
    "starting from step - up and step - down operators for the two oscillators , he was able to construct a representation of the desitter group @xmath17 since this group contains two @xmath18 lorentz groups , we can extract lorentz - covariance properties from his mathematics .",
    "it is even possible to extend this symmetry group to @xmath19 to include damping effects of the oscillators .    in the present paper ,",
    "we avoid group theory and use a set of two - by - two matrices to exploit the physical contents of dirac s 1963 paper . let us start with the hamiltonian for this system of two oscillators , which takes the form @xmath20 it is possible to diagonalize by a single rotation the quadratic form of @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "however , the momentum variables undergo the same rotation . therefore , the uncoupling of the potential energy by rotation alone will lead to a coupling of the two kinetic energy terms .    in order to avoid this complication",
    ", we have to bring the kinetic energy portion into a rotationally invariant form . for this purpose",
    ", we will need the transformation @xmath23 this transformation will change the kinetic energy portion to @xmath24 with @xmath25 . this scale transformation does not leave the @xmath21 and @xmath22 variables invariant .",
    "if we insist on canonical transformations  @xcite , the transformation becomes @xmath26 the scale transformations on the position variables are inversely proportional to those of their conjugate momentum variables .",
    "this is based on the hamiltonian formalism where the position and momentum variables are independent variables .    on the other hand , in the lagrangian formalism ,",
    "where the momentum is proportional to the velocity which is the time derivative of the position coordinate , we have to apply the same scale transformation for both momentum and position variables  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the scale transformation takes the form @xmath27 with eq.([mtrans ] ) for the momentum variables , this expression does not constitute a canonical transformation .    the canonical transformation leads to a unitary transformation in quantum mechanics .",
    "the issue of non - canonical transformation is not yet completely settled in quantum mechanics and is still an open question  @xcite . in either case",
    ", the hamiltonian will take the form @xmath28 here , we have deleted for simplicity the primes on the @xmath7 and @xmath29 variables .",
    "we are now ready to decouple this hamiltonian by making the coordinate rotation : @xmath30 under this rotation , the kinetic energy portion of the hamiltonian in eq.([hamil2 ] ) remains invariant .",

    "for example , the number of quarks inside a static proton is three , while the number of partons in a rapidly moving proton appears to be infinite .",

    "the momentum - energy wave function is just like the space - time wave function .",
    "the longitudinal momentum distribution becomes wide - spread as the hadronic speed approaches the velocity of light .",
    "this is in contradiction with our expectation from nonrelativistic quantum mechanics that the width of the momentum distribution is inversely proportional to that of the position wave function .",
    "our expectation is that if the quarks are free , they must have their sharply defined momenta , not a wide - spread distribution .",
    "however , according to our lorentz - squeezed space - time and momentum - energy wave functions , the space - time width and the momentum - energy width increase in the same direction as the hadron is boosted .",
    "this is of course an effect of lorentz covariance .",
    "this indeed leads to the resolution of one of the the quark - parton puzzles  @xcite .",
    "another puzzling problem in the parton picture is that partons appear as incoherent particles , while quarks are coherent when the hadron is at rest .",
    "does this mean that the coherence is destroyed by the lorentz boost ?",
    "the answer is no , and here is the resolution to this puzzle .",
    "when the hadron is boosted , the hadronic matter becomes squeezed and becomes concentrated in the elliptic region along the positive light - cone axis .",
    "the length of the major axis becomes expanded by @xmath75 , and the minor axis is contracted by @xmath75 .",
    "this means that the interaction time of the quarks among themselves becomes dilated . because the wave function becomes wide - spread , the distance between one end of the harmonic oscillator well and the other end increases",
    "this effect , first noted by feynman  @xcite , is universally observed in high - energy hadronic experiments .",
    "the period of oscillation increases like @xmath75 .    on the other hand , the external signal ,",
    "since it is moving in the direction opposite to the direction of the hadron , travels along the negative light - cone axis .    if the hadron contracts along the negative light - cone axis , the interaction time decreases by @xmath76 .",
    "the ratio of the interaction time to the oscillator period becomes @xmath77 .",
    "the energy of each proton coming out of the fermilab accelerator is @xmath78 .",
    "this leads the ratio to @xmath79 .",
    "this is indeed a small number .",
    "the external signal is not able to sense the interaction of the quarks among themselves inside the hadron .",
    "indeed , feynman s parton picture is one concrete physical example where the decoherence effect is observed . as for the entropy",
    ", the time - separation variable belongs to the rest of the universe . because we are not able to observe this variable , the entropy increases as the hadron is boosted to exhibit the parton effect .",
    "the decoherence is thus accompanied by an entropy increase .",
    "let us go back to the coupled - oscillator system .",
    "the light - cone variables in eq.([eta ] ) correspond to the normal coordinates in the coupled - oscillator system given in eq.([coup6 ] ) . according to feynman s parton picture ,",
    "the decoherence mechanism is determined by the ratio of widths of the wave function along the two normal coordinates .",
    "this decoherence mechanism observed in feynman s parton picture is quite different from other decoherences discussed in the literature .",
    "it is widely understood that the word decoherence is the loss of coherence within a system . on the other hand ,",
    "feynman s decoherence discussed in this section comes from the way the external signal interacts with the internal constituents .",
    "let us first see what effect the charge distribution has on the scattering amplitude , using nonrelativistic scattering in the born approximation . if we scatter electrons from a fixed charge distribution whose density is @xmath80 , the scattering amplitude is @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 which is the momentum transfer .",
    "this amplitude can be reduced to @xmath84 @xmath85 is the fourier transform of the density function which can be written as @xmath86 the above quantity is called the form factor .",
    "it describes the charge distribution in terms of the momentum transfer .",
    "the charge density is normalized : @xmath87 then f(0 ) = 1 from eq.([403 ] ) .",
    "if the density function is a delta function corresponding to a point charge , @xmath88 for all values of @xmath89 then the scattering amplitude of eq.([401 ] ) becomes the rutherford formula for coulomb scattering .",
    "the deviations from rutherford scattering for increasing values of @xmath90 give a measure of the charge distribution .",
    "this was precisely what hofstadter s experiment on the scattering of electrons from a proton target found .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as the energy of incoming electrons becomes higher , we have to take into account the recoil effect of target protons , and formulate the problem relativistically .",
    "it is generally agreed that electrons and their electromagnetic interaction can be described by quantum electrodynamics , in which the method of perturbation theory using feynman diagrams is often employed for practical calculations  @xcite . in this perturbation approach ,",
    "the scattering amplitude is expanded in power series of the fine structure constant @xmath91 therefore , in lowest order in @xmath92 we can describe the scattering of an electron by a proton using the diagram given in fig.([breit ] ) .",
    "the corresponding matrix element is given in many textbooks on elementary particle physics  @xcite .",
    "it is proportional to @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the initial and final four - momenta of the proton and electron respectively .",
    "@xmath96 is the dirac spinor for the initial proton .",
    "@xmath90 is the ( four - momentum transfer@xmath66 and is @xmath97 the @xmath98 factor in eq.([405 ] ) comes from the virtual photon being exchanged between the electron and the proton .",
    "it is customary to use the letter t for @xmath90 in form factor studies , and this t should not be confused with the time separation variable .",
    "in the metric we use , this quantity is positive for physical values of the four - momenta for the particles involved in the scattering process .        in order to make a relativistic calculation of the form factor ,",
    "let us go back to the definition of the form factor given in eq.([403 ] ) .",
    "the density function depends only on the target particle , and is proportional to @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the wave function for quarks inside the proton .",
    "this expression is a special case of the more general form @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the initial and final wave function of the target atom .",
    "indeed , the form factor of eq.([403 ] ) can be written as @xmath104 starting from this expression , we can make the required lorentz generalization using the relativistic wave functions for hadrons .    in order to see the details of the transition to relativistic physics",
    ", we should be able to replace each quantity in the expression of eq.([403 ] ) by its relativistic counterpart .",
    "let us go to the lorentz frame in which the momenta of the incoming and outgoing nucleons have equal magnitude but opposite signs .",
    "@xmath105 this kinematical condition is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ breit ] .",
    "the lorentz frame in which the above condition holds is usually called the breit frame .",
    "we assume without loss of generality that the proton comes along the @xmath6 direction before the collision and goes out along the negative @xmath6 direction after the scattering process , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ breit ] . in this frame",
    ", the four vector @xmath106 has no time - like component .",
    "thus the exponential factor @xmath107 can be replaced by the lorentz - invariant form @xmath108 . as for the wave functions for the protons , we can use the covariant harmonic oscillator wave functions discussed in this paper assuming that the nucleons are in the ground state .",
    "then the only difference between the nonrelativistic and relativistic cases is that the integral in the evaluation of eq.([403 ] ) is four - dimensional , including that for the time - like direction .",
    "this integral in the time - separation variable does not interfere with the exponential factor which does not depend on the time - separation variable .",
    "let us now write down the integral : @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the velocity parameter for the incoming proton , and the wave function @xmath111 takes the form : @xmath112 & { } & \\hspace{10 mm } \\times \\exp{\\left\\ { -\\frac{1}{4}\\left[\\frac{1 - \\beta}{1 + \\beta } ( z + t)^2   + \\frac{1 + \\beta}{1 - \\beta}(z - t)^2 \\right ]   \\right\\ } } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    after the above decomposition of the wave functions , we can perform the integrations in the @xmath7 and @xmath8 variables trivially . after dropping these trivial factors ,",
    "we can write the product of the two wave functions as @xmath113 thus the @xmath6 and @xmath61 variables have been separated . since the exponential factor in eq.([403 ] ) does not depend on @xmath61 , the @xmath61 integral in eq.([406 ] ) can also be trivially performed , and the integral of eq.([406 ] ) can be written as @xmath114 where @xmath70 is the @xmath6 component of the momentum of the incoming nucleon . the ( momentum transfer@xmath115 variable @xmath90 is @xmath116 indeed , the distribution of the hadronic material along the longitudinal direction became contracted  @xcite .",
    "we note that @xmath110 can be written as @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the proton mass .",
    "this equation tells @xmath119 when @xmath120 , while it becomes one as @xmath90 becomes infinity .",
    "the evaluation of the above integral for @xmath121 in eq.([407 ] ) leads to @xmath122 for @xmath123 the above expression becomes 1 .",
    "it decreases as @xmath124 for large values of @xmath125    we have so far carried out the calculation for an oscillator bound state of two quarks .",
    "the proton consists of three quarks . as shown in the paper of feynman _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , the problem becomes a product of two oscillator modes .",
    "thus , the generalization of the above calculation to the three - quark system is straightforward , and the result is that the form factor @xmath126 takes the form @xmath127 which is 1 at @xmath120 , and decreases as @xmath128 ^ 2\\ ] ] for large values of @xmath125 indeed , this function satisfies the requirement of the `` dipole - cut - off '' behavior for of the form factors , which has been observed in high - energy laboratories .",
    "this calculation was carried first by fujimura _",
    "et al . _ in 1970  @xcite .",
    "let us re - examine the above calculation . if we replace @xmath110 by zero in eq.([407 ] ) and ignore the elliptic deformation of the wave functions , @xmath121 will become @xmath129 which will leads to an exponential cut - off of the form factor .",
    "this is not what we observe in laboratories .    in order to gain a deeper understanding of the above - mentioned correlation ,",
    "let us study the case using the momentum - energy wave functions : @xmath130    as before , we can ignore the transverse components .",
    "then @xmath121 can be written as  @xcite @xmath131    we have sketched the above overlap integral in fig .",
    "[ overlap ] . when @xmath120 or @xmath132 , the two wave functions overlap completely in the @xmath133 plane . as p increases ,",
    "the wave functions become separated . however , they maintain a small overlapping region due to the elliptic or squeeze deformation seen in fig .",
    "[ hyperell ] . in the non - relativistic case , where the deformation is not taken into account",
    ", there is no overlapping region as seen in fig .",
    "[ overlap ] .",
    "this is precisely why the relativistic calculation gives a slower decrease in @xmath90 than in the nonrelativistic case .",
    "we have so far been interested only in the space - time behavior of the hadronic wave function .",
    "we should not forget the fact that quarks are spin-1/2 particles .",
    "the effect of this spin manifests itself prominently in the baryonic mass spectra .",
    "since we are concerned here with the relativistic effects , we have to construct a relativistic spin wave function for the quarks",
    ". this quark wave function should give the hadronic spin wave function .",
    "in the case of nucleons , the quark spins should be combined in a manner to generate the form factor of eq.([408 ] ) .",
    "the naive approach to this problem is to use free dirac spinors for the quarks .",
    "however , it was shown by lipes  @xcite that the use of free - particle dirac spinors leads to a wrong form factor behavior . since quarks in a hadron are not free particles , lipes s result does not alarm us .",
    "the difficult problem is to find a suitable mechanism in which quark spins are coupled to orbital motion in a relativistic manner .",
    "this is a nontrivial research problem , and further study is needed along this direction  @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are recent experimental results which indicate departure from the dipole behavior of eq.([410 ] )  @xcite . in addition , there have been other theoretical attempts to calculate the proton form factor .",
    "yes , whenever a new theoretical model appears , there appears a new attempt to calculate the form factor . in the past",
    ", there were many attempts to calculate this quantity in the framework of quantum field theory , without much success .    in 1960 ,",
    "frazer and fulco calculated the form factor using the technique of dispersion relations  @xcite . in so doing they had to assume the existence of the so - called @xmath134 meson , which was later found experimentally , and which subsequently played a pivotal role in the development of the quark model .",
    "even these days , the form factor calculation occupies a very important place in recent theoretical models , such as qcd lattice theory  @xcite and the faddeev equation  @xcite .",
    "however , it is still noteworthy that dirac s form of lorentz - covariant bound states leads to the essential dipole cut - off behavior of the proton form factor .",
    "the hydrogen atom played a pivotal role in the development of quantum mechanics .",
    "quantum mechanics had to be formulated to explain its discrete energy spectra , radiation decay rates , as well as the scattering of electrons by the proton .",
    "the quark model still plays the central role in present - day high - energy physics .",
    "the model can explain the hadronc mass spectra , hadronic structure , and hadronic decay rates .",
    "in addition we are dealing with hadrons which appear as quantum bound states when they are at rest , how would they appear to observes in different frames , particularly in the frame moving with a velocity close to that of light .",
    "it was feynman who proposed the parton model to describe those high - energy hadrons .    in this model",
    ", we have presented a lorentz - covariant model which gives both the quark model and the parton model as two limiting cases .",
    "in addition we discussed the form factor as the case between these limits .    in constructing the lorentz - covariant model",
    ", we noted paul a. m. dirac made life - long efforts to make quantum mechanics consistent with special relativity . we have chosen four of his papers and combined them to construct a consistent theory .",
    "it was like building a canal .",
    "the easiest way to build the canal is to link up the existing lakes .",
    "dirac indeed dug four big lakes .",
    "it is a gratifying experience to link them up .",
    "dirac constructed those lakes in order to study whether the copenhagen school of quantum mechanics can be made consistent with einstein s lorentz - covariant world .    after studying dirac s papers",
    ", we arrived at the conclusion that the copenhagen school completely forgot to take into account the question of simultaneity and time separation  @xcite .",
    "the question then is whether the localized probability distribution can be made consistent with einstein s lorentz covariance .",
