    "the recent publication by the miniboone group of the antineutrino charged - current ( cc ) quasielastic cross section on @xmath1c @xcite completes the neutrino data @xcite allowing a full confrontation of the theoretical descriptions with the experimental data . for neutrinos a successful description of the quasielastic cross section needs the inclusion of the multinucleon component which , in a cerenkov detector is indistinguishable from the genuine quasielastic part @xcite .",
    "its introduction allows a successful reproduction of the data without any modification of the nuclear axial form factor .",
    "the aim of the present work is to test our theoretical description in the different situation provided by the antineutrino interaction , keeping on purpose exactly the same parameters of previous works which successfully reproduce the experimental data @xcite .",
    "the most significant one is the double differential cross section @xcite function of two measured quantities , the muon energy and the scattering angle , hence free from the energy reconstruction problem @xcite .",
    "we briefly summarize the essence of our model which is described in details in @xcite and in @xcite for antineutrinos .",
    "our description treats the genuine quasielastic cross section in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) scheme . for the multinucleon part",
    "our treatment is based on the work by alberico _",
    "@xcite which aims at the description of the @xmath2 transverse response and in particular the filling of the dip between the quasielastic and delta excitations .",
    "@xcite interpreted this filling as originating from the two particle - two hole excitations of the nuclear system by the virtual photon . as for the part which represents the non pionic in medium decay of the delta",
    ", it is taken from the parameterization of oset _ et al .",
    "the work of alberico _ et al .",
    "_ concerned exclusively the magnetic response , which , by virtue of the couplings , is of isovector nature . for our work on neutrinos , the important observation is that the longitudinal , or charge response , in @xmath2 scattering instead does not display an evidence for a cross section excess above the quasielastic peak .",
    "this is confirmed by the superscaling analysis of electron scattering data @xcite .",
    "the various components which build the neutrino cross sections are excited by the isovector component of the charge operator , or by the nucleon spin -isospin operators ( see eq .",
    "( 1 ) of @xcite ) . motivated by these observations",
    "we have introduced the two particle - two hole excitations exclusively in the spin - isospin channels , which is a distinct feature of our description . due to the axial - vector interference term",
    "the spin - isopin contribution weights less for antineutrinos .",
    "the consequence is that the multinucleon piece should weight less on the cross section for antineutrinos than for neutrinos .",
    "this is not the case in other approaches @xcite .",
