    "the motion of a vortex produces a faraday voltage across the array . in this paper",
    "we find three types of new steps .",
    "first we find single - vortex voltage steps .",
    "the voltage @xmath1 on these steps is proportional to an integer multiple @xmath29 of the frequency of the ac drive : @xmath30 in the following we will also consider natural units @xmath31 . then the voltage is normalized such that it corresponds to @xmath32 times the number of jumps between plaquettes of the vortex per time unit .",
    "this differs from another often used normalization by a factor @xmath33 , the number of junctions perpendicular to the direction of the current injection .",
    "on such a step the motion of the single vortex is phase - locked to move an integer number of plaquettes per period @xmath34 .",
    "next we find subharmonic single - vortex steps in the @xmath0-@xmath1 s of both overdamped and underdamped arrays . on these steps",

    "+ finally we simulate a vortex - antivortex pair and obtain the following steps : @xmath37 + each vortex moves @xmath38 plaquettes every @xmath36 periods .",
    "+ these new steps should be contrasted with other types of steps that arise in josephson - junction arrays . in single junctions ,",
    "harmonic ( @xmath39 ) voltage steps are present in both experimentally and numerically obtained @xmath0-@xmath1 s @xcite .",
    "these steps are called single - junction shapiro steps . on these steps",
    "the single junction has @xmath29 phase slips per period @xmath34 . in simulations of and experiments on ac+dc driven arrays so - called giant shapiro steps have been observed @xcite . on these steps the @xmath40 individual junctions along the direction of the external current",
    "are all phase - locked on the same single junction shapiro step , and one obtains @xmath41 the harmonic and subharmonic single - vortex voltage steps are therefore small in comparison to the giant shapiro steps .",
    "subharmonic giant shapiro steps are observed experimentally @xcite and in simulations @xcite .",
    "a particular example of these half - integer steps is found in the axisymmetric coherent vortex states ( acvs ) .",
    "these stationary states correspond to an oscillating pattern of vortex and antivortex streets , which arrange themselves at a well - defined angle with respect to the current direction @xcite .",

    "one can systematically study the underlying microscopic dynamics of the phase - locked vortex motion .",
    "then by considering a vortex - antivortex pair one can study the effect of interaction in its most simple form on the phase - locked states .",

    "the images are then at @xmath180 .",
    "we only take the direct interaction and the interaction of the nearest image charge into account ( i.e. at a distance less then @xmath181 ) .",
    "the only stable current - driven pairs in the simulation are the ones that move at a fixed separation @xmath4 , we therefore fixed the separation @xmath4 in this model .",
    "this leads to the following equation of motion : @xmath182 here @xmath183 is the sign of @xmath184 .",
    "we have computed the @xmath0-@xmath1 s using these equations and we indeed found steps at @xmath175 . to capture the mechanism for the pair steps in the model , we found the essential ingredients to be the interaction and the restriction of @xmath185 to @xmath181 , that is periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath51-direction .",
    "the detailed form of the interaction determines the bias currents for which the steps occur .",
    "+    = 0.1 in    ( 20,25 ) ( -1,2 )      it was found in @xcite that the @xmath0-@xmath1 of a single excess vortex in a dc driven @xmath172 array resembles that of single vortex in the @xmath173 case up to a current @xmath186 . at the latter current the entire checkerboard of vortices depins , producing a voltage that is much larger than the single vortex response .",
    "the excess vortex moves in an even more nonlinear viscous fashion compared to @xmath173 @xcite .",
    "+ now we include an ac component to the dc driving current , and we find steps at @xmath187 .",
    "the factor two can be explained using the scenario proposed in @xcite : first the excess vortex pushes the vortex in front of it to jump , and then follows suit . in total two jumps have been made .",
    "small subharmonic @xmath188 ( @xmath87,@xmath112 ) steps can be distinguished in the @xmath0-@xmath1 shown in the inset of fig.@xmath55[vap4 ] .",
    "+    = 0.1 in    ( 20,25 ) ( -1,2 )    we find that the @xmath0-@xmath1 of an excess vortex and a missing vortex ( with respect to the checkerboard vortex lattice groundstate ) in the @xmath172 case is similar to that of a vortex and an antivortex respectively in the @xmath173 case .",
    "an excess vortex can be annihilated by a missing vortex .",
    "we calculated the @xmath0-@xmath1 for different values of @xmath4 . in these @xmath0-@xmath1 s",
    "one again finds the fractional vortex - antivortex - pair steps as in the @xmath173 case .",
    "one observes in fig.@xmath55[vap4 ] that as the separation @xmath4 becomes larger , these steps disappear , and the steps corresponding to single vortices grow , as one would intuitively expect .",
    "finally only the latter remain .",
    "in this paper we discussed the phase - locking behavior of a single vortex and a vortex - antivortex - pair under the influence of an ac+dc drive .",
    "we obtained harmonic and subharmonic single - vortex voltage steps , and studied the microscopic vortex dynamics .",
    "we found period doubled vortex motion .",
    "the @xmath87 step corresponds to a vortex jumping one plaquette per period , since in a periodic array all the plaquettes in the same column along the periodic direction are equivalent , and one would expect period one behavior .",
    "the simulation , in which period doubling vortex motion is observed , was performed in an @xmath101 array with @xmath102 . in this case",
    "the vortex motion can excite spin waves @xcite .",
    "these spin waves cause a spatially modulated environment for the vortex .",
    "similar phase - locking is observed in a ring of josephson junctions @xcite .",
    "+ the spin waves may also be responsible for the complicated behavior of the hysteresis we observed in ac+dc driven arrays as a function of @xmath93 . in recent experiments",
    "subharmonic giant shapiro steps @xcite were observed in over- and underdamped arrays . in simulations",
    "it was shown that one can have such steps in a 2-d array by either including disorder @xcite or inductive effects @xcite , or generally by any mechanism that breaks the translational invariance of the array .",
    "in overdamped single junctions one can only get subharmonics by using non - sinusoidal current - phase relationships @xcite .",
    "our simulations show that a single vortex itself may phase - lock on subharmonic steps .",
    "the simulation of the pair case shows that single - vortex voltage steps are replaced by fractional steps , which can be understood in terms of vortex interaction .",
    "unfortunately this insight also makes it manifest why generalization to the dynamics associated with shapiro steps that involve many vortices ( such as the axisymmetric coherent vortex states ) is not feasible .",
    "another consequence of the fact that we find subharmonic steps , is that a more realistic vortex equation of motion ( than eq.@xmath55([rjj ] ) and ( [ vjj2 ] ) ) should contain higher harmonic corrections to the sinusoidal potential .",
    "the presence of higher harmonics in the potential experienced by vortices was already noted by lobb et al .",
    "+ we have shown that the parameters for which single - vortex voltage steps can be observed are within the reach of present day experiments .",
