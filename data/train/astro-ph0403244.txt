    "it may be worth recalling some of the main properties of the milky way open cluster system .",
    "the census of open clusters is still highly incomplete beyond distances of a few kpc from the sun , although the situation is improving with new surveys such as 2mass ( see e.g.  the contributions by carpenter and hanson in this volume ) .",
    "the luminosity function of milky way open clusters was analysed by @xcite , who found it to be well modelled by a power - law @xmath1 over the range @xmath2 .",
    "however , they also noted that extrapolation of this luminosity function would predict about 100 clusters as bright as @xmath3 in the galaxy , clearly at odds with observations , and thus suggested some flattening of the lf slope at higher luminosities .",
    "the brightest known young clusters ( e.g.  ngc  3603 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 per ) have absolute @xmath6 magnitudes of @xmath7 , corresponding to total masses of several thousand . recently , there have been claims that the cyg ob2 association might be an even more massive cluster @xcite , but this object is probably too diffuse to be a bound star cluster ( though it does have a compact core ) .",
    "there are , however , a number of old ( @xmath8 gyr ) open clusters in the milky way with masses of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "these objects are likely to have lost a significant fraction of their total mass over their lifetimes , and may thus originally have been even more massive .",
    "they serve to illustrate that , even in the milky way , the distinction between globular and open clusters is not always clear - cut .",
    "it has been recognized for about a century that the magellanic clouds , and the lmc in particular , host a number of `` blue globular clusters '' @xcite . among the most massive of these",
    "is ngc  1866 , with a mass of around @xmath10 and an age of @xmath11 myr @xcite .",
    "an older example is ngc  1978 with similar mass but an age of 23 gyr , clearly demonstrating that at least some such clusters can survive for several gyrs .",
    "the interaction between the lmc and the milky way has probably affected the star formation history of the lmc , which is known to be bursty with major peaks in the star formation rate correlating with perigalactic passages @xcite .",
    "one might argue , then , that the formation of ymcs in the lmc could be induced by interaction with the milky way . however , the lmc is not the only example even in the local group of a galaxy that hosts ymcs .",
    "another well - known example is m33 , which does not display evidence for a bursty cluster ( and , presumably star- ) formation history @xcite . @xcite",
    "have identified many more star clusters in this galaxy , though not all are particularly massive . with the launch of hst it became possible to investigate more crowded and/or distant systems in detail and attention started to shift towards more extreme starbursts , including a large number of merger galaxies ( e.g.   whitmore , this volume ) .",
    "it is now clear that luminous , young star clusters often form in very large numbers in such galaxies , and this has led to suggestions that formation of `` massive '' star clusters might require special conditions such as large - scale cloud - cloud collisitions @xcite .",
    "however , the question remains to be answered why some non - interacting galaxies also contain ymcs , whereas apparently the milky way does not .",
    "ymcs are now being found in an increasing number of non - interacting galaxies , posing a severe challenge for formation scenarios which require special conditions .",
    "during the 1980s , some studies had already identified ymcs in a few galaxies beyond the local group @xcite .",
    "we undertook a systematic , ground - based study of 21 nearby spirals , aiming at identifying cluster systems and further investigating which factors might lead to the formation of ymcs @xcite . generally lacking sufficient resolution to identify clusters as spatially resolved objects ,",
    "our candidate lists were compiled based on @xmath12 photometry , selecting compact objects with @xmath13 and @xmath14 brighter than @xmath15 ( for @xmath16 ) or @xmath17 ( for @xmath18 ) .",
    "we also required that the objects had no h@xmath19 emission .",
    "the @xmath20 limit excluded most foreground stars , while the @xmath14 limit was designed to minimise the risk that individual , luminous stars in the galaxies would contaminate the sample .",
    "as the mass - to - light ratios of star clusters are highly age dependent , the magnitude cut does not translate to a well - defined mass limit , but most clusters selected in this way have masses @xmath21 .",
    "our survey would probably pick up a few clusters in the milky way . in the lmc ,",
    "8 clusters in the @xcite catalogue pass our selection criteria .",
    "we found a surprising variety in the numbers of ymcs in the galaxies .",
    "some galaxies , such as ngc  45 , ngc  300 and ngc  3184 contained hardly any clusters passing our selection criteria , but in others we found more than a hundred .",
    "the two most cluster - rich galaxies were ngc  5236 ( m83 ) and ngc  6946 , both of which are also known for their very high supernova rates and surface brightnesses , indicative of very active star formation .",
    "following @xcite , we defined the _ specific luminosity _ of young star clusters as @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the total @xmath25-band luminosities of clusters and their host galaxy .",
    "the @xmath26 turned out to correlate strongly with the host galaxy area - normalised star formation rate @xcite , as if bound star clusters form more efficiently in higher - sfr environments . here , it is important to note that our sample excludes the very youngest clusters , which are often located in crowded regions in spiral arms where they are difficult to identify with ground - based imaging .",
    "therefore , it is probably better to think of @xmath26 as a _ survival- _ rather than a formation efficiency .",
    "in fact , most stars probably form in clusters , both in normal galaxies such as the milky way ( * ? ? ? * carpenter this volume ) and in the mergers like the antennae ( fall , this volume ) .",
    "the fraction of those clusters which remain bound may vary , however .    while @xmath26 may be a useful measure of the overall richness of a cluster system",
    ", it does not provide any information about possible variations in the cluster mass distributions , and in particular , whether some galaxies form a higher proportion of _ massive _ clusters than others .",
    "this question still remains largely unanswered , because mass distributions are difficult to derive observationally . in order to convert observed cluster luminosities to masses , the m / l ratios need to be known .",
    "these , in turn , depend strongly on the cluster ages , which can not be reliably estimated without photometry in ultraviolet passbands .",
    "this is mostly a consequence of the fact that the colours of young clusters are dominated by hot stars , where the rayleigh - jeans approximation applies for passbands centered at optical wavelengths .",
    "a `` poor man s '' solution is to look at luminosity- rather than mass functions , bearing in mind the first are not necessarily identical to the latter .    in @xcite ,",
    "archive hst data were used to analyse the luminosity functions ( lfs ) of star clusters in 6 nearby spirals which had previously been studied from the ground .",
    "the lfs were generally found to be consistent with power - laws with slopes between @xmath27 and @xmath28 , somewhat steeper than the value found for milky way open clusters by @xcite , though not extending nearly as deep . for young clusters in m66",
    ", @xcite found a lf slope of @xmath29 .",
    "if the luminosity function has a universal power - law form which is populated at random , one would predict a strong correlation between the total number of clusters in a galaxy and the luminosity of the brightest cluster .",
    "such a relation is indeed observed and has a slope , normalisation and scatter similar to those expected from sampling statistics arguments @xcite .",
    "however , it should be noted that a few galaxies do stand out , having clusters that are much too bright for the total number of clusters in those galaxies .",
    "notable examples are ngc  1569 and ngc  1705 , both of which are dominated by 12 highly luminous clusters .",
    "the possibility remains open that these clusters formed by a special mechanism , but the issue needs to be investigated in more detail .",
    "hst archive data for a larger sample ( 17 ) of nearby spirals were analysed in @xcite .",
    "the main aim here was to study the structural parameters and investigate possible correlations with age , mass or other cluster properties .",
    "the clusters were modelled using ` eff ' profiles of the type shown by @xcite to fit lmc clusters : @xmath30^{-\\gamma/2 }    \\label{eq : eff}\\ ] ] structural parameters were obtained from fits to wfpc2 images and combined with @xmath31 photometry from ground - based imaging .",
    "[ fig : reff_mass ] shows the cluster half - light radii ( ) versus masses estimated from bruzual & charlot ssp models .",
    "only clusters with @xmath32 are included in this plot , as  is undefined for @xmath33 .",
    "the majority of clusters have half - light radii of 34 pc albeit with a fairly large scatter .",
    "interestingly , this is similar to the effective radii of galactic and extragalactic old globular clusters .",
    "the dashed line shows the relation corresponding to a constant cluster density ( @xmath34 ) , while the solid line is a least - squares fit to the data .",
    "no strong correlation between  and mass is observed .",
    "a formal fit to the data yields @xmath35 , similar to the @xmath36 relation found for young clusters in the merger remnant ngc  3256 by @xcite .",
    "the observation that no strong correlation exists between cluster size and mass implies that high - mass clusters generally have much higher stellar _ densities _ than low - mass clusters , a fact that may have important implications for theories for cluster formation .",
    "if the cluster ages are known , luminosities can be converted to masses using simple stellar population models and assuming a stellar initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "an alternative approach is to obtain dynamical mass estimates by measuring the internal velocity dispersions and cluster sizes and applying the virial theorem .",
    "the dynamically derived m / l ratios can then be compared with ssp models for different imfs , providing a potentially useful method to constrain the imf .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath37 , mass @xmath38 and projected half - light radius  are related as @xmath39 where @xmath40 . in practice",
    ", however , there are many caveats to this method , both theoretical ones ( assumption of velocity isotropy , virial equilibrium , effects of mass segregation and binaries ) , and practical ones : for a mass of @xmath10 and @xmath41 pc , the line - of - sight velocity dispersion is less than 4 km / s .",
    "the red supergiants which provide most of the lines useful for velocity dispersion measurements have macroturbulent velocities on the order of 10 km / s , with a scatter of perhaps 12 km / s @xcite .",
    "since the velocity dispersions usually have to be derived from integrated light , it is clear that this method is limited to relatively massive objects .",
    "even if spectra of sufficient resolution to resolve the line broadening ( @xmath42 ) and s / n could be obtained , an exact match between the template stars used to derive the velocity dispersions and those present in the cluster becomes increasingly critical as the cluster mass decreases .",
    "additionally , the clusters have to be close enough that reasonably reliable size estimates can be obtained , although these are less critical since @xmath38 scales only linearly with .",
    "several groups have obtained dynamical mass estimates for extragalactic young star clusters , sometimes with hints of non - standard imfs ( e.g.  @xcite ; see also mengel , this volume ) . in our sample of spiral galaxies , we found a few clusters for which dynamical mass estimates appeared feasible .",
    "critical selection criteria were that the clusters be reasonably well isolated , so that the spectroscopic observations would not be contaminated by neighbouring objects , and that they have hst imaging for reliable size measurements .",
    "objects which satisfy these criteria include one cluster in ngc  6946 which was observed with the hires spectrograph on the keck i telescope @xcite , and two clusters in ngc  5236 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cl5236 ] ) , observed with uves on the eso vlt @xcite .",
    "structural parameters are available for all clusters from hst imaging , and ages and reddenings were estimated by comparing ground - based @xmath31 colours with bruzual & charlot ssp models .",
    "basic properties for the three clusters are summarised in table  [ tab : cprop ] .",
    "they all have masses greater than @xmath43 , well in excess of those of the most massive young lmc clusters .",
    "even if our reference frame had been the lmc rather than the milky way , we would still have characterised these clusters as `` massive '' . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmtol ] , the observed @xmath6-band m / l ratios are compared with ssp model predictions for various imfs .",
    "these ssps were computed by populating stellar isochrones from the padua group @xcite according to the imfs indicated in the figure legend , i.e.  a @xcite imf and @xcite - type imfs with lower mass cut - offs at 0.01 , 0.1  and 1.0 .",
    "the kroupa imf nominally extends down to 0.01 , but the lower cut - off is of little importance as the slope below 0.08  is very shallow . within the error bars ,",
    "the three clusters all appear consistent with a `` standard '' kroupa - like imf .",
    "in particular , there is no evidence for an excess of high - mass stars in any of these clusters .",
    "we checked the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmtol ] against the bruzual & charlot models , which are available for salpeter imf truncated at 0.1 @xmath44 and found very similar results , with differences at the level of 0.1 mag at most .",
    "it should be emphasized that this method does not constrain the exact shape of the imf .",
    "power - law imfs with a shallow slope , for example , would mimick the effect of a salpeter imf with a high - mass cut - off .",
    "it is becoming increasingly clear that `` massive '' star clusters can form in a wide variety of galaxies , and not just in mergers or otherwise disturbed galaxies . with the possible exception of some dwarf galaxies ,",
    "the luminosity distributions of young star clusters generally appear to be power - laws .",
    "if cluster luminosities are sampled at random from a power - law distribution , the most luminous clusters will naturally be rare , but so far there is no evidence for a statistically significant upper cut - off . in other words ,",
    "very luminous ( and massive ) clusters appear to form whenever clusters form in large numbers .",
    "this is illustrated by the fact that young star clusters with masses up to @xmath0 have been identified in the disks of several apparently normal , isolated spiral galaxies with rich cluster systems .",
    "these galaxies , such as ngc  5236 , ngc  6946 are characterised by high star formation rates , but these do not generally appear to be triggered by interactions with other galaxies .",
    "dynamical mass estimates are now available for a small number of these clusters , and the mass - to - light ratios are compatible with standard kroupa - type imfs .",
    "there is every reason to be optimistic that important clues to the formation of classical globular clusters may be obtained by studying their younger counterparts in the local universe .",
