    "cassiopeia  a ( cas  a ) is the youngest galactic supernova remnant ( snr ) with an age of @xmath17  yr , as according to @xcite it is associated with the explosion observed by @xcite in 1680 .",
    "@xcite have found that the elemental abundances in cas  a are consistent with those expected from the remnant of a massive star , possibly a wolf - rayet star @xcite , and therefore cas  a is considered to have been a type  ii supernova .",
    "one therefore expects a compact central remnant , such a neutron star or black hole , based on the initial mass function of type  ii supernovae ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "from the first - light images of the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ ( cxo ) , @xcite reported detection of a compact source located at the apparent center of cas  a. the detection of this source , cxo  j232327.9@xmath0584842  ( hereafter the x - ray point source or xps ) , was later confirmed in archival _ rosat _ @xcite and _ einstein _ @xcite data .",
    "the xps  is located within @xmath18 of the expansion center of cas  a @xcite , and given the space density of agn the chance of finding one within this distance of the center is quite small .",
    "we convert the count rates from @xcite to the 0.52.4  kev band , and get an absorbed flux of @xmath19 . comparing this with the agn @xmath20-@xmath21 relation from @xcite , we would expect @xmath22 , or @xmath23  agn of this flux at the center of cas  a. it is thus extremely improbable that the xps  is an agn , a fact further confirmed by its relatively steep spectrum @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is generally believed that the xpsis associated with the remnant of the cas  a progenitor @xcite .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of the xps , as determined by @xcite and @xcite , can be fitted by a power - law with a photon index @xmath24 .",
    "other acceptable fits include thermal bremsstrahlung ( @xmath25  kev ) , blackbody ( @xmath26  kev , @xmath27  km ) , or neutron star atmospheres ( @xmath28  kev , @xmath29  km for the model of @xcite ; @xmath30  kev , @xmath31  km for the model of @xcite ) .",
    "the nature of the xps  is unclear .",
    "however , we have an idea as to what it is not .",
    "the spectral index of the xps  is significantly steeper than those typical for young x - ray pulsars , its luminosity is @xmath32 times less than those of young x - ray pulsars , and there is no evidence for a synchrotron nebula @xcite .",
    "the spectrum is similar to that of an anomalous x - ray pulsar ( axp ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the x - ray luminosity is at least several ( if not 10100 ) times fainter than that typical for axps .",
    "the xps  is cooler but much more luminous than isolated neutron stars @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there have not been any detections of optical @xcite or radio ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) emission from the xps , nor have x - ray pulsations been detected @xcite , though the current limits are not very constraining .",
    "therefore , the xps  is almost certainly not a young pulsar similar to the crab .",
    "theories as to its identity range from a cooling neutron star emitting from polar caps to an accreting black hole @xcite .    from measures of line ratios in the cas  a remnant",
    ", @xcite finds the extinction to be @xmath33  mag in the direction of one filament .",
    "later radio studies found significant variations of @xmath34 on scales of @xmath35 , and overall values ranging from 45  mag for the north and northeastern rim and @xmath366  mag for the rest of the snr @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xcite find extinction values of 4.65.4  mag across the northern portion ( assuming @xmath37 ) .",
    "we will therefore adopt a middle value of @xmath38  mag .",
    "we assume that cas  a and the xps  are at a distance of @xmath39  kpc @xcite , which we parameterize as @xmath40  kpc .",
    "in this letter we report on optical / near - ir searches for a counterpart to the xps .",
    "we believe that given the unknown nature of xps , searches at all wavelengths are warranted and even upper limits may constrain the nature of this enigmatic source . the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec_obs ] we detail our observations and reduction techniques .",
    "section  [ sec_results ] contains a description of the results , while section  [ sec_analysis ] presents an analysis of these results .",
    "finally , a discussion and conclusions are in section  [ sec_discuss ] .",
    "the snr cas a was observed several times with the cxo . after the initial detection in the first - light images @xcite ,",
    "a long hrc - i observation was obtained on 1999 december 20 , and a third observation with the hrc - s in imaging mode was taken on 2000 october 5 .",
    "a discussion of the results from this observation is in preparation ( murray et al .",
    "2001 ) ; here we provide only the source location information .",
    "table  [ tab : xray ] gives the point source locations and estimated uncertainties ( including estimates of systematic errors ) .",
    "we estimate that the overall positional uncertainty for all of these observations is @xmath41 ( 1-@xmath3 ) .",
    "the observations were carried out primarily with the near infrared camera ( nirc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) mounted on the 10-m keck  i telescope , augmented with archival hst / wfpc2 images .",
    "we also took auxiliary optical and infrared calibration images with the cosmic imager on the palomar 5-m telescope ( p200 ) , the pfircam @xcite infrared imager on the p200 , and the p60ccd optical imager on the palomar 1.5-m telescope ( p60 ) .",
    "a summary of the instruments , filters , exposures , and conditions is listed in table  [ tab_obs ] .",
    "the optical data were reduced with the standard iraf ccdred package .",
    "the images were bias subtracted , flat - fielded , registered , and co - added .",
    "the infrared data were reduced with custom iraf software .",
    "the images were dark subtracted , flat - fielded , and corrected for bad pixels and cosmic rays .",
    "we then made object masks , which were used in a second round of flat - fielding to remove holes from the flats .",
    "the data were then registered , shifted , and co - added .",
    "the hst images were processed using the standard drizzling procedure @xcite .",
    "the data from the p60ccd were used as the astrometric reference .",
    "we matched 36 non - saturated stars to those from the usno - a2.0 catalog @xcite .",
    "using the task ccmap we computed a transformation solution , giving @xmath42 residuals ( all astrometric residuals are 1-@xmath3 for each coordinate unless otherwise indicated ) .",
    "we then used this solution to fit stars on the cosmic images . using 37 stars",
    ", we again obtained @xmath42 residuals .",
    "we then used 15 stars on the cosmic images to fit the hst image , getting @xmath43 residuals .",
    "this solution was then used for the infrared images , fitting 10 stars on the nirc images with @xmath44 residuals .",
    "this gives @xmath45 position uncertainties relative to the icrs , assuming the uncertainties intrinsic to the usno - a2.0 are @xmath46 ( for each axis ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we then transfered this solution to the pfircam images ( @xmath46 residuals ) , but as this is only a photometric reference the absolute position is not important .    for the optical photometry",
    ", we used @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 observations of the standard fields landolt  110 , ngc  7790 , and pg  1657 @xcite carried out with the p60ccd .",
    "we fit the observations over the whole night using airmass corrections and first - order color terms , and measured the @xmath48 zero - point magnitude .",
    "we then examined 25 stars on the cas  a images common to both the p60ccd and cosmic images , and from this determined the zero - point for the photometric night . from these data we also determined the limiting magnitude to be @xmath50  mag .    for the infrared photometry",
    ", we used 3 observations of the faint ukirt standard stars fs  29 and fs  31 @xcite taken with the pfircam .",
    "these observations were used to determine @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 zero - points ( we assumed the @xmath53 magnitudes were the same as the @xmath54 magnitudes , as the correction is typically @xmath55  mag : much smaller than our uncertainties ; @xcite ) . from these images",
    "we then found 5 stars common to the pfircam and nirc images , and determined zero - point magnitudes for nirc .",
    "we searched for a counterpart to the x - ray point source , at position @xmath56 , @xmath57 , with @xmath41 uncertainty ( table  [ tab : xray ] ) .",
    "see figure  [ fig_images ] for the separate optical / ir images .",
    "there was no source on cosmic images , giving @xmath6  mag ( 3-@xmath3 limit ) for any possible counterpart ( this agrees with the previous limit of @xmath58  mag and @xmath59  mag ; @xcite ) . on the nirc , pfircam , and",
    "hst images there was a source @xmath60 away from the x - ray position , at @xmath61 , @xmath62 ( @xmath63 in each coordinate ) . given the astrometric uncertainties , the overall position uncertainty is @xmath64 in each axis , so this source is 1.5-@xmath3 away from the nominal position .",
    "we label this source a , and consider it as a potential candidate counterpart or companion to the x - ray source .",
    "the magnitudes of source a are @xmath65  mag , @xmath1  mag , @xmath66  mag , and @xmath2  mag .",
    "there are no other sources within the @xmath67 radius 90% confidence circle .",
    "using the reddening and zero - point calibration data from @xcite , we plot the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) for source a in figure  [ fig_sed ] .",
    "this incorporates both the detections and limits .    to determine if source a could be a star , we compared model stellar colors from @xcite with our data .",
    "we fitted for three parameters : the visual extinction @xmath34 , the distance in kpc @xmath68 , and the stellar model ( which includes the effective temperature @xmath69 , the surface gravity @xmath70 , and the metallicity [ fe / h ] ) .",
    "we assumed that the star would be a zero - age main - sequence star such that @xmath71 @xcite , and used the bolometric corrections and reddening from @xcite to find the expected magnitudes . to account for the upper limits in our fitting , we minimized a modified @xmath72 statistic , such that @xmath73    here , @xmath74 runs over the different filters , @xmath75 is the observed magnitude or limit for that filter , @xmath76 is the model magnitude , and @xmath77 is the uncertainty .",
    "the model uses standard vega - based magnitudes , where the hst data do not .",
    "therefore we converted the hst magnitude to the vega - based system using @xmath78  mag , appropriate for sources of this color .",
    "we do not incorporate model uncertainties into this statistic .",
    "minimizing this @xmath72 seeks the best model that comes close in magnitude to the detections while remaining fainter than the non - detections . a full - fledged bayesian analysis ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would be more accurate , but we only wish to demonstrate the plausibility of model fits , not assign specific probabilities to different models .    given the number of variables , this fit is somewhat unconstrained .",
    "we restrict the extinction and distance to reasonable values ( @xmath79  mag , @xmath80 ) , and fit for @xmath81 ( appropriate for late m stars ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , we require that @xmath34 roughly scale with @xmath82 , excluding models that are very distant but have almost no extinction .",
    "we find that our detections and limits are entirely consistent with a cool ( m68 ) , pop  ii , main - sequence star , which is between the earth and cas  a. good fits are obtained for stars with @xmath42800  k , [ fe / h]@xmath83 , @xmath842.0  kpc , and @xmath853.2  mag ( see figure  [ fig_sed ] for examples ) . we do not give the @xmath72 value or formal confidence regions , as the @xmath72 in equation  [ eqn_chi ] is somewhat contrived and the models for stars this cool are not well determined @xcite , but figure  [ fig_sed ] demonstrates the plausibility of the fits . that there is a star within @xmath60 of the xps  is quite believable :",
    "the theoretical star - count models of @xcite give @xmath86 of the appropriate colors with @xmath87  mag , leading to a false coincidence rate of 1.0 .",
    "the best - fit star has @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 .",
    "slightly deeper @xmath49 band observations should be able to verify the classification of source a.    as one might expect , there is a significant anti - correlation in the fits between values of @xmath68 and @xmath34 , with @xmath91  kpc and @xmath92  mag variations giving reasonable fits , but the fits for the range of likely extinctions for cas  a ( 46  mag ) at 3.4  kpc are definitely poor .",
    "assuming that source a is a late - type star , we examine whether it could be associated with the xps , implying that both are in the foreground and that the xps  is not associated with cas  a. from @xcite , we see that for a star with @xmath93 ( from the model for source a ) , the x - ray luminosity is @xmath940.12.4  kev@xmath95 ( also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , giving unabsorbed ( denoted by superscript u ) x - ray - to - infrared flux ratios of @xmath96 and @xmath97 for such a star . converting the flux of the xps   to the rosat passband ( using w3pimms ) , it has ratios of @xmath98 , @xmath99 , which are drastically different .",
    "in addition , @xcite and @xcite did not observe any variability from the xps , unlike late - type stars that can vary by factors of @xmath100 on small time scales @xcite .",
    "source  a therefore could not emit the x - rays observed from the xps .",
    "we conclude that the xps  was not detected , and add @xmath7  mag , @xmath101  mag and @xmath9  mag ( 3-@xmath3 ) , along with a rough limit of @xmath10  mag , to the previously mentioned limits .",
    "based on a synthesis of cxo , _ rosat _ , and _ einstein _ data , @xcite fit the x - ray spectrum of the xps .",
    "the absorbed flux is @xmath102 in the 0.36.0  kev range @xcite .",
    "power - law and pure blackbody models give good fits to the absorption - corrected data , and are plotted as representative x - ray spectra in figure  [ fig_allsed ] .",
    "these results are similar to those from @xcite .",
    "@xcite prefer the results of a h / he polar - cap model with a cooler fe surface , but all we wish to illustrate is that blackbody models are consistent with the optical limits , while power - law models require a break between the x - ray and optical bands .    in figure",
    "[ fig_allsed ] we also plot the expected optical magnitudes of representative x - ray sources ( an axp and a tight x - ray binary ) for comparison .",
    "these magnitudes are derived by taking the x - ray - to - optical flux ratios for these objects and scaling them to the x - ray flux of the xps .",
    "we can likely reject sources like 4u  1626@xmath10367 @xcite from consideration , but the extrapolation of the axp 4u  0142@xmath061 @xcite is consistent with the current limits .",
    "giving the presumed distance and reddening , our limits translate to @xmath11  mag , @xmath12  mag , @xmath13  mag , @xmath14  mag , and @xmath15  mag .",
    "we find the observed x - ray - to - infrared flux ratios to be @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 ( the x - ray flux is in the 0.36.0  kev band ) .",
    "if we correct for interstellar absorption , we find unabsorbed ratios of @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , using the x - ray flux from @xcite .",
    "these flux ratios , larger than those inferred previously , tighten constraints on the identity of the xps(e.g . * ? ? ?",
