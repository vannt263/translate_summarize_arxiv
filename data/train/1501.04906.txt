    "in the standard cosmological approach , the universe is described by a homegeneous and isotropic solution of einstein field equations , known as friedmann - lematre ( fl ) spacetimes  @xcite .",

    "while this spacetime is easily identified in the early universe , matter clusters and structures grow under the effect of gravity so that the distribution of matter in our late time universe exhibit large inhomogeneities .    over the past years",
    "significant activity has been devoted to the definition of averaging procedures  @xcite in order to construct a notion of a coarse - grained spacetime .",
    "irrespective of the question of whether this procedure could explain the recent acceleration of the universe , averaging methods are interesting since let us compare the evolution of a system described at different scales .",
    "in such a coarse - graining , information about the microscopic behaviour of the system is lost , which is at the origin of the notion of entropy .",

    "this latter proposal reduces to the bekenstein - hawking entropy when integrated over the interior of a schwarzschild black hole and increases as inhomogeneities grow .",

    "in particular , it seems to depend on the whole history of the spacetime , being present on the left hand side of eq.([derscliftonetall - first ] ) a time derivative .",

    "@xcite reduces to @xmath103",

    "if @xmath104 is a function of the perturbations and @xmath105 its average on a given domain then , from a theoretical point of view , we only have access to the distribution of @xmath105 , that is to @xmath106 , which is the ensemble average of @xmath105 .",
    "hence , one has to perform the ensemble average of the quantities defined in secs .",
    "[ sec3-dd ] and  [ sec3-br ] .",
    "to compare the definitions of entropy , we have now to choose an averaging procedure . in general",
    ", one has two possibilities .",
    "the first is to average over a volume embedded in a spatial hypersurface , for example the one of constant redshift @xmath107 , while the second is to average over a two - sphere defined as the intersection of our past or future light - cone with this spatial hypersurface .",
    "these two averaging procedures turns out to be equivalent for terms of the kind @xmath108 , with @xmath109 a linear function of the gravitational potential .",
    "this is due to the fact that in this case we average a quantity already of the second order in perturbation theory ( and the averages can be performed only at the background level , if one stops at second order ) , for a case in which the shape of the domain of integration is not important ( see eq .",

    "for terms of the kind @xmath110 the average depends on the shape of the domain of integration and the two procedures give different results ( see eq .",
    "( 5.4 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite for the light - cone averaging case and ref .",
    "@xcite for the spatial averaging case ) .",
    "therefore , it is important to specify which prescription has to be used to obtain a physically meaningful result . as a guideline we consider the fact that our entropy should describe the entropy of the large - scale structure of the universe ; that is , it should characterize the universe as a whole and should be averaged over an extended region .",
    "one can then immediately exclude the light - cone averaging prescription for several reasons .",
    "first , the light - cone averaging prescription corresponds to an average over a two - sphere with dimensions dependent from the value of redshift considered , after we fix the observer .",
    "for example , for a redshift equal to @xmath111 the region of integration ( the two - sphere ) would be all inside our local universe , where non - linearities became extremely important .",
    "even worse , the region of integration goes to zero at redshift equal to zero .",
    "furthermore , considering different times of observation for a given observer ( i.e. different light - cones ) the entropy at a given moment would be evaluated using different regions of integration .    as a consequence , it is easy to understand why the light - cone averaging prescription can not be applied in this context .",
    "the right choice for the case in consideration is then the spatial averaging prescription .",
    "this should not surprise us because the entropy is not an observable in the standard way  .    for both definitions of the entropy , obtained in secs .",
    "[ sec3-dd ] and  [ sec3-br ] , the key quantity to be evaluated is @xmath112 .",
    "now , let us consider a peculiar - gravitational potential described by a linear power spectrum of fluctuations , with the transfer function given in ref .",
    "@xcite ( without the contribution from the baryons ) and the cosmological parameters from planck  @xcite . considering the fourier expansion of the first - order gravitational potential we obtain , in fourier space ( and independently from the integration domain @xmath6 ; see ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath113 with @xmath114 the power spectrum of the gravitational potential .",
    "one can then easily see that the integration in eq .",
    "( [ cscalarmodek ] ) has an ultraviolet divergence if one takes the linear power spectrum defined in ref .",
    "we shall thus consider this as an effective description and hereafter we will assume a cut - off @xmath115 to stay within the linear regime and regularize the ultraviolet divergence .    to assume a constant cut - off @xmath116 is enough for our purpose .",
    "in fact , despite in general the non - linearity scale evolve in time , we are mainly interested in a @xmath0cdm model , starting from when the cosmological constant begins to dominate . for this case",
    "the non - linearity scale stays nearly constant and our assumption is justified . as we will see in the following ,",
    "this is the case where the different entropy proposals here considered behaviour in a different way one with respect to the other .    while the result in eq .",

    "this is a well motived physical choice for the case under consideration because we want to stay inside the linear regime and the ultraviolet cut - off chosen is , indeed , the present threshold of the linear regime .",

    "the universe , both at the background level and at the perturbed level , is attracted toward a de sitter spacetime .",
