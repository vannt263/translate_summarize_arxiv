    "during last few years many new particles have been discovered in different experiments . with increased running energies of colliders and",
    "improved sensitivity of detectors , more hadrons are expected to be observed . to better understand and analyze the experimental results , parallel theoretical and phenomenological studies on the spectroscopy and decay properties of newly discovered particles",
    "are needed .",
    "the lhcb collaboration at cern reported first observation of the @xmath0 particle through the semileptonic @xmath4 transition in 2011 @xcite .",
    "this decay has an important contribution to the total branching ratio of the semileptonic @xmath5 decays , so its analysis helps us get more information about the semileptonic @xmath5 decays which is less known experimentally compared to lighter @xmath6 mesons .",
    "although the quantum numbers of the observed @xmath0 particle is not exactly known , however , its width and decay modes favors the quantum number @xmath1 @xcite . in this article",
    ", we calculate the mass and current coupling constant of the @xmath0 in the framework of two - point qcd sum rules considering it as a charmed - strange tensor meson .",
    "the interpolating currents of the tensor mesons contain derivatives , so we calculate the two - point correlation function first in coordinate space then transform calculations to the momentum space to apply borel transformation and continuum subtraction in order to isolate the ground state particle from the higher states and continuum . for some experimental and theoretical works / reviews on the properties , structure and decay channels of charmed - strange mesons ,",
    "see for instance @xcite and references therein .",
    "the outline of the article is as follows . starting from an appreciate two - point correlation function , we derive qcd sum rules for the mass and current coupling constant of the @xmath0 charmed - strange tensor meson in next section . in section 3 ,",
    "we numerically analyze the sum rules obtained in section 2 and obtain working regions for auxiliary borel parameter and continuum threshold entered to calculations . making use of the working regions for auxiliary parameters ,",
    "we obtain the numerical values of the mass and decay constant of the tensor meson under consideration . replacing the strange quark with the up or down quark",
    "we also find the masses and decay constant of the corresponding @xmath7 system , by comparison of which we estimate the order of su(3 ) flavor symmetry violation in the charmed tensor system .",
    "hadrons are formed in a range of energy very lower than the perturbative or asymptotic region , so to investigate their properties some non - perturbative approaches are required . among non - perturbative methods",
    "the qcd sum rule @xcite is one of the most attractive and applicable tools to hadron physics as it is free of any model dependent parameters and is based on qcd lagrangian . according to the philosophy of this model , to calculate the masses and current coupling constant , we start with a two - point correlation function and calculate it once in terms of hadronic parameters called the physical or phenomenological side , and the other in terms of qcd parameters in deep euclidean region via operator product expansion ( ope ) called the qcd or theoretical side .",
    "the qcd sum rules for the mass and current coupling constant are obtained matching both sides of the two - point correlation function under consideration . to stamp down the contribution of the higher states and continuum we apply borel transformation to both sides of the acquired sum rules and use the quark - hadron duality assumption .    to derive the qcd sum rules for physical quantities under consideration ,",
    "we start with the following two - point correlation function : @xmath9\\mid   0{\\rangle},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the time - ordering operator and @xmath11 is the interpolating current of the @xmath8 charmed - strange tensor meson . considering the quantum numbers of @xmath8 meson , its interpolating current in terms of quark fields",

    "hence , after applying derivatives we will set @xmath22 then perform integral over four-@xmath20 .    in the physical side , the correlation function in eq.([correl.func.101 ] )",
    "is calculated by saturating it via a complete set of states with the quantum numbers of @xmath8 . after isolating the ground state and performing the four - integral",
    "we get @xmath23 where @xmath24 symbolizes the contribution of higher states and the continuum . to proceed , we need to define the matrix element @xmath25 in terms of current coupling constant @xmath26 and polarization tensor @xmath27 : @xmath28 using eq.([lep ] ) in eq.([phen1 ] ) needs performing summation over polarization tensor , which is given as @xmath29 where @xmath30 as a result , for the the final expression of the physical side , we get @xmath31 where we will choose the explicitly written structure to extract the qcd sum rules for the mass and current coupling constant of the tensor meson .",
    "in qcd side , the correlation function in eq.([correl.func.101 ] ) is calculated in the deep euclidean region where @xmath32 , with the help of ope where the short ( perturbative ) and long distance ( non - perturbative ) contributions are separated .",
    "the perturbative part is calculated using the perturbation theory , while the non - perturbative part is parameterized in terms of qcd parameters such as quarks masses , quarks and gluon condensates , etc .",
    "therefore , any coefficient of the selected structure in qcd side can be written as a dispersion integral plus a non - perturbative part : @xmath33 where the spectral density @xmath34 is obtained from the imaginary of the perturbative contribution , i.e. , @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "our main goal in the following is to calculate the spectral density @xmath34 and the non - perturbative part @xmath36 . using the tensor current presented in eq.([tensorcurrent ] ) in the correlation function in eq.([correl.func.101 ] ) and contracting out all quark pairs via the wick s theorem , we obtain @xmath37\\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\left[\\beta\\leftrightarrow\\alpha\\right ] + \\left[\\nu\\leftrightarrow\\mu\\right]+\\left[\\beta\\leftrightarrow\\alpha , \\nu\\leftrightarrow\\mu\\right]\\bigg\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to proceed , we need to know the expressions of the heavy and light quarks propagators , which are calculated in @xcite . by ignoring from the gluon fields which have very small contributions to the mass and current coupling of the tensor meson",

    "the integral over four-@xmath20 gives us a dirac delta function , making use of which we perform the integral over four-@xmath46 . to perform the final integral over four-@xmath47 we use the feynman parametrization method and the relation @xmath48^{\\alpha-\\beta-2}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after lengthy calculations for the spectral density",
    ", we get @xmath49 for the non - perturbative part , we also obtain @xmath50    after acquiring the correlation function in both phenomenological and qcd sides , by the procedures mentioned in the beginning of this section , we obtain the following sum rule for the mass and current coupling of the @xmath8 tensor meson : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the continuum threshold and @xmath53 is the borel mass parameter . the function @xmath54 in borel scheme",
    "is obtained as @xmath55 the mass of the @xmath8 tensor meson alone is obtained from @xmath56",
    "in this section , we numerically analyze the sum rules obtained for the mass and current coupling constant of the @xmath8 tensor meson in the previous section . for this aim",
    "we use some input parameters as @xmath57 @xcite , @xmath58 @xcite and @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "the sum rules for above mentioned physical quantities also contain two auxiliary parameters : the borel parameter @xmath53 and the continuum threshold @xmath52 coming from the borel transformation and the continuum subtraction , respectively . in the following , we shall find working regions of these parameters such that the results of the mass and current coupling show weak dependences on these auxiliary parameters according to the general criteria of the method .",
    "the continuum threshold @xmath60 is not completely capricious , but it is correlated with the energy of the first excited state with the same quantum numbers . as a result , we choose @xmath61 for the continuum threshold .     on borel",
    "mass parameter @xmath62 at @xmath63.,width=377 ]     on borel mass parameter @xmath62 at @xmath63.,width=377 ]    the working region for the borel mass parameter is calculated demanding that not only the contributions of the higher state and continuum are stamped down but also the contribution of the higher order operators are very small .",
    "the later means that the series of sum rules for physical quantities are convergent and the perturbative part constitutes an important part of the whole contribution . in other words , the upper bound on the borel parameter is found by demanding that [ nolabel ] _",
    "s_min^s_0(s ) e^-s / m^2 _ s_min^(s ) e^-s",
    "/ m^2  >   1/2 , which leads to    [ e8202 ] m_max^2 = 3  gev^2 .",
    "the lower bound on this parameter is obtained requiring that the contribution of the perturbative part exceeds the nonperturbative contributions . from this restriction",
    "we get [ e8202 ] m_min^2 = 1.5  gev^2 .",
    "we depict the dependence of the current coupling constant and mass of the tensor meson under consideration on borel mass parameter at a fixed value of continuum threshold in figures 1 and 2 . from these figures",
    "we see that the results weakly depend on the borel mass parameter in its working region . here",
    ", we would like to make the following comment .",
    "the above analyses have been done based on , so called , the standard procedure in qcd sum rule technique such that the quark - hadron duality assumption as a systematic error has been used and the continuum threshold has been taken independent of borel mass parameter . however , as also stated in @xcite , the continuum threshold can depend on @xmath53",
    ". hence the standard procedure does not render the realistic errors and , in fact , the actual errors should be large .",
    "our numerical calculations show that taking the continuum threshold dependent on borel mass parameter brings an extra systematic error of @xmath64 , which we will add to our numerical values .    making use of the working regions for auxiliary parameters and taking into account all systematic uncertainties",
    ", we obtain the numerical results of the mass and current coupling constant for @xmath8 tensor meson as presented in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "we also compare our result on the mass with the existing experimental data which shows a good consistency .",
    "the errors quoted in our predictions belong to the uncertainties in determination of working regions for both auxiliary parameters , those existing in other inputs as well as systematic errors .",
    "our result on the current coupling constant of the charmed strange @xmath8 tensor meson can be checked in future experiments .",
    "@xmath65 & @xmath66 & @xmath67 + @xmath26 & @xmath68 & - +    our final goal is to replace the strange quark with the up / down quark and estimate the order of su(3 ) flavor violation .",
    "our calculations show that this violation is maximally @xmath69 in the case of charmed tensor meson .",
