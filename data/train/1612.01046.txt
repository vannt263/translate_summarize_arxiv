    "longshore ( alongshore ) currents are ubiquitous oceanic flows in nearshore environments ( see @xcite , for a descriptive review ) .",
    "the two mechanisms responsible for their existence are wave stresses and alongshore sea elevation gradients . because longshore currents affect nearshore bathymetry and beach morphology , and are responsible for a great deal of nearshore transport , models for these currents are of great practical utility .",
    "presently , deterministic wave - resolving models are used with good results , capturing some of the complex dynamics of the nearshore , including longshore currents ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . see also @xcite ) . of note",
    "are wave - resolving , depth - integrated models based upon the boussinesq equations , such as funwavec ( @xcite ) .",
    "these have shown considerable forecasting skill ( see for example , @xcite , and @xcite , in which field data on eddy variability and dye and drifter dispersion are compared to funwavec model output ) .",
    "the success of funwavec in capturing a wide range of nearshore oceanic phenomena rests upon its generality : it includes higher order dispersion ( see @xcite ) , a general bottom drag parametrization ( see @xcite ) , wave breaking momentum transformation parametrization via newtonian damping ( see @xcite ) and the breaking viscosity model @xcite .",
    "non - wave resolving complex models of the nearshore ocean environment exist as well .",
    "these also have compared favorably with certain aspects of longshore current dynamics and observations , such as longshore shear instabilities .",
    "they can also capture other nearshore flows , such as rip currents , consistent with observations ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references contained therein ) .",
    "none of the models capture longshore current observations in a statistically faithful manner . by fidelity",
    "we mean that the time series generated by the model and the observations are indistinguishable , statistically .",
    "the most familiar modeling approach to improving model fidelity is to resolve and include more physics ( or better physics ) .",
    "the present state - of - the - art in longshore modeling is the wave - resolving models mentioned above .",
    "an approach that directly focuses on obtaining statistical fidelity is statistical emulation ( see @xcite ) . in this strategy observations",
    "are used to build phenomenological models .",
    "the fundamental modeling strategy consists of proposing a basic statistical distribution or a regression model .",
    "structure is built into the model by calibrating the model s correlations and other statistical dependences with data .",
    "the goal of this paper is to propose and demonstrate the use of an alternative modeling approach , called stochastic parametrization .",
    "it is an intermediate between the deterministic and the emulator approaches to modeling physical phenomena .",
    "this strategy yields a model that has as much structure and physics as possible , leaving as little as possible to chance . a good stochastic parametrization yields structure in the statistics of its time series by the blend of deterministic and stochastic elements , rather than by tuning the model using data to incorporate the correlations and structure of the observations .",
    "a common use for stochastic parametrization is to incorporate in a computationally efficient way unresolved dynamics that can not be ignored even if the model focused on large spatio - temporal scale phenomena .",
    "a familiar practical example of deterministically parametrizing small scales is via homogeneization ( see @xcite ) : when the small scales offer a certain amount of scale separation and it is statistically homogeneous , the small scale averages that persist appear in the resulting deterministic model as complementary or added terms .",
    "a more sophisticated approach , in computational fluid mechanics , is large eddy simulations ( les ) of turbulent flows . in that case",
    "the complementary / added terms themselves have their own dynamics which come from closures of higher moment statistics .",
    "stochastic parametrization is meant to increase a model s fidelity , but unlike les , it will not do so rationally . for the longshore current model featured in this paper the stochastic parametrization will be used to capture the small scale variability present in the observations , enhancing this way its fidelity , not its rationality .",
    "in this study we will purposely choose the simplest possible model for longshore current dynamics , a balance model , as a starting point . clearly , a model that already has improved physics would be a better choice for the development of an operational stochastic model , but a simple and familiar model makes it plain , to what extent the stochastic parametrization is effective in enhancing the original deterministic model s fidelity .",
    "balance models for longshore currents capture nothing more than the most basic of physical processes , albeit under strong assumptions .",
    "nearly all of the physics in longshore current models are captured by empirical parametrization : the models incorporate parametrized wave radiation ( or the vortex force ) , wave breaking , turbulence , stress and drag forces .",
    "the longshore model we will use is derived from the vortex force formulation for the evolution of waves and currents in the nearshore ( see @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "the vortex force model is a general , non - wave resolving , model .",
    "it was used in @xcite to describe the evolution of rip currents , as well as longshore currents in @xcite . this model ( see [ model ] ) will be referred to as the _ vortex force model _ , in order to distinguish it from the simpler and specialized _ balance model _ for longshore current dynamics .",
    "the plan of the rest this paper is as follows : after describing essential background to the nature of the data , in section [ bdata ] , we introduce in section [ sec : model ] the longshore balance model that will be used as a basis for the stochastic parametrization .",
    "section [ sec : model ] discusses the conditions under which the longshore balance model is derived from the non wave - resolving , wave - current interaction , vortex force model .",
    "stochastic parametrization can lead to better _ consistency of model sensitivity _ , at the expense of increased uncertainty .",
    "the topic of consistency of sensitivity will be taken up in section [ sa ] .",
    "a model that has consistent sensitivity will have a wide range of physically - meaningful parameter combinations with which to capture a broad spectrum of physical outcomes .",
    "the balance model will be used to explore and illustrate the consequences of sensitive consistency .",
    "the stochastic parametrization , inspired by the data and constrained by the physics of longshore currents , is introduced in section [ balance ] .",
    "stochastic parametrization of unresolved physics , as evidenced by the data , is used to construct a stochastic balance longshore model . suggesting a simple model for observational data that is",
    "clearly non - gaussian will lead us to introduce gaussian mixtures . with this choice of stochastic parametrization",
    "the stochastic longshore model is shown to compare favorably with observations .",
    "notably , the model captures correlations present in the data without having to explicitly put these into the model .",
    "furthermore , the stochastic longshore model will be shown to have consistent sensitivity .",
    "however , the use of gaussian mixtures reduces the fidelity of the model .",
    "the point of using the mixture model will nevertheless make the model amenable to simple linear / gaussian data assimilation methods .",
    "data assimilation is a very useful methodology for combining observations and models .",
    "stochastic models are well suited for this application , as will be shown in section [ da ] , using the proposed stochastic longshore model and observations in a concrete data assimilation example calculation .",
    "in the process of constructing a stochastic parametrization , as well as in testing the resulting stochastic model , we will make use of field observations .",
    "we will use the data set collected in duck , north carolina by herbers , elgar , guza , and birkemeier , long and hathaway ( see @xcite ) .",
    "henceforth , we shall refer to this data as the _ duck data_. the duck data repository provides data , and in particular , information on nearshore flow mean velocity .",
    "it also has recordings of ocean pressure , temperature , and depth , over the course of several months .",
    "it also contains information on the peak frequency , direction , and sea elevation amplitude of incoming waves .",
    "bathymetry as well as the conditions under which the data was obtained is available as well .",
    "the duck data as well as ancillary information are available from : + frf.usace.army.mil/pub/experiments/duck94/spuv .",
    "+ a plot of a typical bottom topography cross section appears recreated in figure [ fig : topography ] .",
    "the plot also shows the data collection devices and data collection locations .",
    "the cross shore and longshore components of the velocity were collected at a sampling rate of 2 hz for 10784 seconds , every 3 hours .",
    "the data collection spanned the months of august , september , october , and early november , 1994 .",
    "sporadic instrumentation failure lead to interruptions in data collection .",
    "the cross - shore velocity component is zero on average for most of the data gathering campaign , and is ignored in this study .",
    "the specific  spuv data  streams we will make use of are from measurement locations v12 , v13 , v14 , v15 , which were located approximately at the offshore coordinates 205 , 220 , 240 , and 260 m , respectively .",
    "the transect we will work with is at roughly 930 m in the alongshore ( @xmath0 ) direction . at these stations",
    "the data exhibits good signal to noise characteristics .",
    "the locations correspond a location right before the waves shoal and break .",
    "m. the type of measurements that were collected are indicated .",
    "stations v12-v15 are indicated as well . ]",
    "we will also be using another set of data , collected during the same time period as the spuv longshore current data , and it consists of wave elevation , wave period , and wave direction , further out from shore , roughly 900 m offshore , where the water depth is approximately 8 m .",
    "this data is available from frf.usace.army.mil/pub/experiments/duck94/frf .",
    "figure [ fig : bathy ] shows a more general view of the bathymetry , reconstructed from october 1994 data . as can be seen , the alongshore variability in the bathymetry is mild and is used to justify picking a single @xmath0-location for the data .        in any event ,",
    "our focus is on the methodology of stochastic parametrization , rather than on observations or the validity of the specific model chosen .",
    "one of the earliest balance models for longshore currents is due to longuet - higgins @xcite . in his model longshore currents",
    "are driven by the wave radiation stress ( see @xcite ) .",
    "several several simplifying assumptions were made in the formulation of the model : the current was assumed steady , the bottom @xmath1 was assumed to be gently sloping , _",
    "i.e. _ , with a slope @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the ( offshore ) distance from the shore , in the range @xmath4 .",
    "the bottom was also assumed featureless , and void of alongshore @xmath0 dependence .",
    "nonlinear effects were ignored , wave refraction was ignored and the angle of incidence of the waves was assumed to not differ considerably from the normal to the beach . finally , the water column depth @xmath5 was approximated by the depth @xmath6 , which is the distance from the bottom to the quiescent sea level .    in its classic form",
    "the model suggests that longshore currents result from a balance of the drag force @xmath7 , the gradient of the ( transverse ) radiation stress tensor @xmath8 due to waves , and dissipation @xmath9 . with the depth - averaged and time - averaged current denoted by @xmath10",
    ", the current @xmath11 is given by the @xmath0-component ( alongshore ) of the momentum balance .",
    "the balance reads @xmath12 the first term on the right hand side on ( [ lh ] ) is the bottom drag , with a particularly simple parametrization : the drag force is proportional to the current , @xmath13 is the proportionality constant .",
    "the second term is the gradient of the net stress per unit area due to waves , where @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 is the wave action , @xmath16 is the wave frequency .",
    "the angle @xmath17 is with respect to the coordinate @xmath3 , normal to the shore .",
    "the last term is the @xmath0-component of the lateral dissipation , @xmath18 is a dimensionless tunable parameter .",
    "this particular dissipation model was suggested by longuet - higgins , @xcite .",
    "it is based upon dimensional arguments and makes many approximations including the assumption that the longshore currents occur over mildly sloped bathymetry .",
    "( see @xcite , for an analysis and discussion of this dissipation model and some of its alternatives ) .    in what follows",
    "we will use a similar and equally simple balance model .",
    "we will denote it the _ longshore balance model _",
    "the model derives from the _ vortex force _ model for wave current interactions , which is described in [ model ] .",
    "similar assumptions as those made by longuet - higgins take us from the vortex force model to the longshore balance model ( see discussion leading to ( [ longshore ] ) .",
    "the longshore model is @xmath19 in ( [ eq : longhig2 ] ) @xmath20 the wavenumber magnitude is @xmath21 .",
    "the sea elevation is @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is gravity .",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 are parameters associated with wave breaking and sea elevation , respectively .",
    "the longshore balance model is equivalent to a balance model proposed by thornton and guza @xcite .",
    "when they compared their model to field data , obtained off the gently sloping coast of their test site in california ( usa ) , they found good agreement .",
    "this agreement seemed not to depend in any strong way on having dissipation .",
    "however , when they compared their model to data obtained over a barred beach , such as the duck site data , their model was inadequate .",
    "further analyses of comparisons of models and the duck data associated with the delilah field campaign @xcite brought into question the linear model for the bottom drag force , and further , the need for a spatially varying bottom friction in order to get better agreement between model and data . over the years",
    "several improved models for the bottom drag have been proposed .",
    "see , for example , @xcite , for a bottom drag model that is directly inspired by the duck and superduck data sets .",
    "nevertheless , we will keep the linear bottom drag model in the longshore balance model , since it leads to special modeling challenges and the goal of this work is to demonstrate stochastic parametrization as a tool with which to improve model fidelity .",
    "there are several practical reasons for an analysis of the model s sensitivity , to either forcing / boundary conditions , initial conditions , or parameters .",
    "one reason is to identify which of these has the most impact ( usually in the linearized sense ) on the model outcomes ( see @xcite ) .",
    "sensitivity and uncertainty are two different things , but they are sometimes intertwined .",
    "another reason is to diagnose sensitive dependence on initial conditions in evolution equations .",
    "sensitive dependence is a hallmark of chaotic systems .",
    "yet another reason is to evaluate the robustness of numerical approximations to evolution equations .",
    "the most common way to assess these sensitivities is by a forward linearized approach . in forward sensitivity analysis",
    "we want to determine how relative perturbations of the outputs depend on relative perturbations of the inputs ( in backward sensitivity analysis we instead ask what relative inputs are required to produce a certain relative perturbation of the output ) .    in similar fashion , one could also determine explicitly or implicitly the functional relationship between model outcomes and perturbations of parameters .",
    "one outcome is to determine whether a broad spectrum of physical outcomes are reached by reasonable and sensible range of parameters .",
    "how large should one determine the ranges of outputs and input parameters ?",
    "one reasonable approach is to seek similar ranges in the physics of its measurements and the physical variables that inform the parameters in the model .",
    "consistency of sensitivity ( to parameters ) is similarity in the structure and the relative magnitudes of variations in the model outcomes to variations in the parameters , and their measured values .",
    "clearly , the concept is qualitative and it is not universally applicable : some model parameters have no physical counterpart .",
    "forward ( linear ) sensitivity analysis is used to determine the explicit dependency of longshore velocity fluctuations on the wave forcing .",
    "these fluctuations are with respect to the ensemble mean , denoted by @xmath26 .",
    "in what follows we will ignore the lateral dissipation , as it is thought to be less critical to longshore dynamics than the other forces in the longshore balance model ( see @xcite ) .",
    "ignoring dissipation in ( [ eq : longhig2 ] ) we get the balance equation @xmath27 the sensitivity of the longshore current is obtained by taking the first variation to obtain @xmath28 the sensitivity in the angle , even when small , can be physically dramatic when the average angle of incidence is nearly zero since @xmath29 in the denominator is small .",
    "nevertheless , we will focus in this study on the variability of velocity fluctuations to changes in @xmath22 and @xmath30 . concerning these ,",
    "@xmath31 we denote the wave amplitude supplied by wave forcing from the deep waters as @xmath32 .",
    "since @xmath33 ( see ahead , in ( [ aeq ] ) , for the specifics ) , we approximate @xmath34 by @xmath35 , and assume that the relative variability in the amplitude @xmath36 , the relative variability in the drage coefficient . with these approximations ,",
    "@xmath37 we refer to ( [ dv ] ) as the drag - wave forcing _ sensitivity analysis estimate _ , and we will build a stochastic parametrization that respects , to a certain extent , this analysis .",
    "there are two challenges in using data to tune model parameters . posed as questions ,",
    "what sort of statistics do we apply on the data to affect the comparison to the model ? and the more challenging question ,",
    "for a given set of parameters , do we retain consistency with the inherent structure of the model , for a reasonable range of model inputs ?",
    "the duck data will be used to tune the model represented by ( [ eq : longhig2 ] ) .",
    "( the dissipation will be ignored ) . the entire 8 m depth offshore time series data set for @xmath21 , @xmath17 , and @xmath32 is used to get estimates of their mean values .",
    "( the dispersion relationship ( [ dispersion ] ) and wave number conservation ( [ eq : wavenumbers ] ) equations are required to relate the observed wave period to @xmath21 ) .",
    "the wave action equation ( [ eq : waveaction ] ) is needed to relate @xmath22 at the measuring stations to the observational data , @xmath32 , obtained in the deeper waters .",
    "we then proceed by finding @xmath30 so that the mean data for @xmath11 at station v13 coincides with the predicted value of @xmath11 , via ( [ eq : longhig2 ] ) , at that location .",
    "figure [ fig : estd ] shows contours of discrepancy between the value of the calculated and observed longshore velocity at station v13 .    ) , in @xmath38 parameter space .",
    "the model was forced using observational data captured in 8 m depth offshore waters .",
    "for the wave forcing @xmath39 a time average value is used .",
    "time average values were also used for @xmath17 and for @xmath21 .",
    "the contours represent the mean of the difference between the estimated velocity and the measured velocity at station v13.,width=288,height=192 ]    we note that for small off shore wave amplitudes @xmath32 , the longshore velocity is relatively insensitive to the drag parameter , while for large @xmath32 , the longshore velocity is indeed sensitively dependent on @xmath30 .",
    "the conclusion from this exercise is that for certain data one is forced to choose unphysical combinations of @xmath40 ) to obtain agreement between model outcomes and field data , or parameter choices that make the model unacceptably sensitive .",
    "both of these issues are symptomatic of inconsistency of the sensitivity : even if one obtains reasonable agreement between the model and the data some of the combinations that lead to agreement between model and data may not respect the sensitivity estimate , ( [ dv ] ) .",
    "( fortunately the situation is less dramatic when the ( full ) complex model is used instead and is tuned to obtain reasonable agreement with data ) .",
    "the model we chose is simply too crude and thus the inconsistency is extreme , reflecting the fact that the model is missing some of the important physics of the problem , and the simple physical mechanisms that are retained in the model are incapable of describing the observations with reasonable values for the model parameters .",
    "it is not hard to see that such inconsistency of sensitivity is also shared by the more complex vortex force model .",
    "however , stochasticity can be introduced to tame the inconsistency , as will be shown in what follows .",
    "the goal is to produce a simple , consistent in sensitivity , balance model for longshore currents .",
    "this will be accomplished by enhancing a balance model via stochastic parametrization in order to account for the short - time variability observed in the data .",
    "the short - time variability can not be captured by the original balance model ( [ eq : longhig2 ] ) , even when the forcing is obtained from the 8 m water observations .",
    "clearly , a great deal of physics is missing .",
    "we will only pursue stochastic parametrization rather than to complement the crude model with better or more physics .",
    "we will begin with an analysis of the data .",
    "two data sets will be used in the model formulation .",
    "the  8 m offshore \" wave data largely informs @xmath41 in ( [ eq : longhig2 ] ) , and a longshore time series data will be used as  training data . \"",
    "we will then compare the training data , which is the longshore velocity time series at a specific location , to the longshore model driven by the 8 m wave data .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 in the drag force will be calibrated to enhance the role played by the drag term in ( [ eq : longhig2 ] ) in constributing to the empirical histogram that results from a comparison of the training data and the longshore model driven by the 8 m offshore data .",
    "the remaining discrepancies in the empirical distributions are then brought to a minimum by the addition of a stochastic parametrization of momentum contributions .",
    "the discrepancy in the histograms of the forcing and the longshore velocity is presumed largely due to missing physics in the original balance model .",
    "a model that assigns to stochasticity as little of the model fidelity as possible is preferred , and further , we favor simple noise processes rather than complicated ones .",
    "we will use make frequent use of gaussian mixtures to capture non - gaussianity .",
    "see @xcite for details on gaussian mixtures .",
    "we will be focusing on longshore velocity field data from one particular location , station v13 .",
    "this is the  training data . \"",
    "we will denote this data time series as @xmath42 , in what follows .",
    "some of the basic statistics on the @xmath42 data appear in table 1 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : newtab ]    these statistics pose a challenge to the balance model ( [ eq : longhig2 ] ) and it is apparent in figure [ fig : estd ] : if we use mean values for the data @xmath32 as well as @xmath43 and @xmath17 and we insist that the drag force parameter @xmath30 is positive , the model will generate a negative mean estimate for @xmath42 .",
    "one might think that using the more complex model presented in the appendix will circumvent the conundrum , however , the derivation of the longshore balance mode using the vortex force model as a starting point makes it plain that the problem would be present had the vortex force model be used .",
    "( one could use the median or modal values for the quantities in question , but the model appearing in the appendix is a mean - field model ( see @xcite ) ) .",
    "we use instead an ensemble modeling approach .",

    "parametrization usually refers to the application of empiricism rather than `` first principles '' in the formulation of some aspect or the totality of a model of some physical process . by first principles we mean fundamental laws of physics , or conservation or axiomatic principles ( such as the least action principle ) .",
    "parametrization is used a great deal in problems involving multi - physics and multi - scales and/or as a way to include an important phenomenon in a model that has not yielded to first principle explanations or that can not be resolved .",
    "the forces in the longshore balance model are in fact empirically determined , even though it has a basis in conservation principles of mass , momentum , and energy .",
    "stochastic parametrization produces a type of model that makes sense in the ensemble .",
    "the aspect that is parametrized in the model generally does not have a physical or rational basis , however , its inclusion in the model is critical to its fidelity . by fidelity",
    "we mean that it is consistent with data in an ensemble sense .",
    "unlike stochastic emulators , which are also aiming for fidelity , and in which structure has to be derived from the data and explicitly added , a good stochastically parametrized model leaves to chance as little as possible and derives its structure from whatever physics is being captured by the model .    in this study",
    "we purposely picked a simple deterministic model to use to illustrate how one goes about the task of parametrizing missing physics via stochasticity .",
    "we could have instead used a more sophisticated model for longshore currents .",
    "for example one could start with ( [ sde1])- ( [ sde2 ] ) , with ( [ sde1 ] ) replaced by ( [ eq : momentum ] ) , or perhaps use a wave - resolving model such as funwavec ( @xcite ) ) .",
    "the parametrization process would proceed in the same way . the simple longshore balance model , however , is simply understood and the role played by stochastic parametrization better understood and appreciated .    in our specific example",
    "the stochasticity was used to represent fast variability that was not resolved by the deterministic longshore balance model .",
    "a successful outcome of the parametrization is that the stochastic longshore model was able to display correlation times similar to those estimated from the data itself .",
    "situations when stochastic parametrization may be a viable modeling option abound .",
    "as we showed , one such situation is when unresolved but essential physics are important to the faithful representation of observations via models .",
    "other situations introduce stochasticity into model parameters .",
    "one would like to ascribe as much of the phenomena being modeled to physically - based constructs , however , in some instances one is willing to exchange rationality for model robustness , or replace the notion of determinism for one in which ensembles make sense .    with regard to model robustness",
    ", stochastic parametrization may be a way to achieve better consistency of sensitivity .",
    "models , particularly ones that have an overwhelming dependence on parametrization often have very delicate tuning of parameters and very limited ranges of physical relevance .",
    "consistency of sensitivity is a property that allows one to assess whether the sensitivity of a model outcome to changes in parameters is similar to those found in the natural problem ( in the event that the parameter is a physically - meaningful quantity ) .",
    "the consistency of sensitivity analysis could thus be used as a way to determine the parameter ranges expected for the expected spectrum of physical outcomes .",
    "a model that is consistent in sensitvity will be applicable to a wide variety of physical situations , using sensible or physically meaningful parameter combinations ; conversely the analysis can also suggest when this is just not possible .",
    "finally , consistency of sensitivity could be used to compare different models or as another tool for empirical analysis .    practically speaking one",
    "can see how the introduction of stochasticity can make a model consistent in its sensitivity , at the expense of introducing uncertainty / randomness .",
    "our claim is that it is sometimes a reasonable price to pay , especially in complex models of multi - scale / multi - physics phenomena .",
    "furthermore , the introduction of stochasticity , provided it does not lead to a serious loss of rationality , can be exploited in a bayesian setting , wherein forecasts are replaced by ensemble estimates and combine the stochasticity of the model itself and the uncertainties of observations via bayesian inference and data assimilation .",
    "non - wave resolving shallow - water models that capture longshore currents , forced by steady waves and no wind , have 2 known solution manifolds : steady longshore currents and unsteady ones ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the stability depends on the strength of the bottom drag , namely , when the drag acceleration is prominent , the longshore currents are steady . in what follows",
