    "however , recent studies @xcite argued that the morse potential should be replaced by a potential with a local maximum at @xmath9 , which induces a double - well structure , where one of the wells extends to infinity ( both kinds of potentials are depicted in figure [ figpot ] ) .",
    "the existence of breathers residing in the potential well near @xmath6 can be proved with classical methods such as the center manifold reduction for maps @xcite , variational methods @xcite , and the continuation from the anticontinuum limit @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "a more delicate problem is the existence of large - amplitude breathers residing in the other potential well which extends to infinity .",
    "large - amplitude stationary solutions bifurcating from infinity as @xmath11 have been obtained in @xcite .",
    "these solutions are localized near a single site , say @xmath12 , and their amplitude diverges as @xmath11 .",
    "large - amplitude breathers in a finite - size neighborhood of these stationary solutions have been constructed in @xcite for small coupling @xmath13 , using the contraction mapping theorem and scaling techniques .",
    "these large - amplitude breathers oscillate beyond the potential barrier of @xmath5 at @xmath14 , and their amplitude goes to infinity as @xmath11 .",
    "existence of large - amplitude breathers oscillating everywhere above the potential barrier of @xmath5 was left open in @xcite .",
    "our goal is to show the existence of large - amplitude breathers oscillating in several potential wells , setting - up a continuation of these solutions from infinity as @xmath11 . to illustrate some key points of our analysis ,",
    "let us consider the example @xmath15 here @xmath5 has a global minimum at @xmath6 , a pair of symmetric global maxima at @xmath16 with @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .    in the standard anti - continuum limit ,",

    "only the family of periodic solutions with @xmath29 can be continued by the anti - continuum technique developed by mackay and aubry @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are two families of unbounded solutions : one corresponds to oscillations beyond the potential barrier of @xmath5 for @xmath30 and the other one corresponds to oscillations above the potential barrier .",
    "roughly speaking , the new technique developed in @xcite allows one to obtain large amplitude breathers  close \" to unbounded solutions of the first family for @xmath24 .",
    "the present paper considers large - amplitude breathers near the second family of unbounded solutions .",
    "these two families of breathers are obtained by ",

    "the amplitudes and periods of the resulting breathers go to infinity . as a result",
    ", we need a careful control of nonresonance conditions in order to prove the existence of such breathers .",
    "although a part of our continuation procedure involving the contraction mapping theorem is close to the one developed in @xcite , our mathematical analysis is quite different because our breather solutions scale differently in the different potential wells , which induces some singular perturbation analysis and more delicate estimates than in @xcite .",
    "note also that the contraction mapping theorem has been used by treschev @xcite to prove the existence of other types of localized solutions ( solitary waves ) in fermi - pasta - ulam lattices , in which nearest - neighbors are coupled by an anharmonic potential having a repulsive singularity at a short distance . in this case",

    "assumption ( p2 ) allows us to develop a contraction mapping argument for the small - amplitude oscillations on the sites @xmath51 , a procedure which can not be carried out if a quartic term is present in the expansion of @xmath5 near the origin .",
    "it would be useful to relax this condition , which assumes a very weak anharmonicity of small amplitude oscillations .",
    "note that the quartic term in @xmath52 near @xmath6 is also excluded in the recent analysis of scattering of small initial data to zero equilibrium by mielke & patz @xcite .",
    "assumption ( p3 ) allows for large - amplitude oscillations at the central site @xmath12 .",
    "assumption ( p4 ) allows us to consider linear oscillations of the central site outside the compact support of @xmath53 .",
    "this property is used in lemma [ lemma - spectrum ] below to solve the singularly perturbed oscillator equation for renormalized oscillations at @xmath54 .",
    "this compact support assumption is quite restrictive , and it would be interesting to relax it in a future work , by considering e.g. exponentially decaying potentials ( as in example ( [ potential - example ] ) ) and treating exponential tails as perturbations of the present case .    we note that fura & rybicki @xcite have proved the existence of periodic solutions bifurcating from infinity for a class of finite - dimensional hamiltonian systems with asymptotically linear potentials using degree theory . our analysis is different and consists in two steps .",
    "we first reduce the infinite - dimensional hamiltonian system to a perturbed oscillator equation describing large amplitude oscillations at the breather center , using the contraction mapping theorem .",
    "once this has been achieved , we solve the reduced problem using a topological method ( schauder s fixed point theorem ) .",
    "our main result is the existence of the large - amplitude breathers if the potential @xmath5 satisfies assumptions ( p1)(p4 ) as well as the technical non - degeneracy condition in equation ( [ condition - central - nonresonance ] ) below . as further problems",
    ", it would be interesting to analyze the existence of multibreather solutions bifurcating from infinity , as well as the stability of such solutions , as it was done previously for finite - amplitude breathers near the standard anti - continuum limit ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
