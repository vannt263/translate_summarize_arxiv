    "the internet of things ( iot ) is a novel network architecture that is rapidly gaining attention in the scenario @xcite.the physical mark - up language ( pml ) is a collection of common , standardized xml vocabularies to represent and describe information related to epc network enabled objects as presented by @xcite .",
    "the documents of each component to exchange data in epc network system are xml documents based on pml core schema , and this type document is called the pml document as described by @xcite . among them , the purpose of the pml core schema is to provide a standardized format for the exchange of the data captured by the sensors in an auto - id infrastructure , e.g. rfid readers .",
    "pml is to be regarded as the complementary vocabularies for business transactions or any other xml application libraries , which include a new library composed of relevant definitions about epc network system , rather than to replace the xml to be a new markup language .",
    "epc tags to identify each of objects are adapted by auto - id center .",
    "different sorts of sensors which equipped on shops , warehouses , workshops and so on @xcite , are to acquire epc data and other information , such as temperature and geography location .",
    "it is essential for epc network to process these data signed by pml documents at speed of hundreds of millions per second . for managing theses huge data stream and reduce network traffic ,",
    "it is inevitable to develop the high - performance technology for managing these pml documents , such as implementing a joint forensics - scheduling scheme@xcite , applying a multi - layered algorithm to manage real - time data @xcite , or compressing the amount of data , filtering and integrating these tag data .    for above purpose",
    ", one of the effective methods is clustering as presented by @xcite , which could depend on the structure and semantics of these data .",
    "indeed , the similarity computation , which measures the similarity of the compared pml documents , is the foundation of the clustering method . in this paper",
    ", we mainly focus on the similarity computation of pml documents .",
    "many researches have proposed a wide range of algorithms for xml similarity computation , the kind of technique being used mainly include ed - based ( tree edit distance ) , ir - based ( information retrieval ) and others ( e.g. , edge matching , path similarity , etc . ) to measure similarity of the xml documents .",
    "some of above methods of xml similarity mainly concern on the structural properties of xml data and disregard element / attribute values of xml@xcite , but many others consider values in their similarity computations .",
    "with respect to xml documents which are less structurally disparate ( they might originate from the same data source , and might even conform to the same grammar ) , similarity computation based on structure and content is a favorable method @xcite . as follow",
    ", we introduce algorithms of structure - and - content method .",
    "liang and yokota@xcite provided an approximate xml similarity method based on leaf nodes ( leaf node values in particular ) , entitled lax ( leafclustering based approximate xml join algorithm ) .",
    "kade and heuser@xcite developed a method for comparing xml documents as documents lists .",
    "weis and naumann@xciteput forward a method entitled dogmatix for comparing xml elements ( and consequently documents ) based on their direct values , as well as corresponding parent and children similarities .",
    "an approach for document / pattern comparison , developed in the context of data integration and xml querying , is proposed by dorneles et al.@xcite .",
    "leitao@xcite provided a probabilistic approach , using a bayesian network to combine the probabilities of children and descendents being duplicates , for a given pair of xml elements in the documents being compared .",
    "the similarity between two xml documents corresponds to the probabilities of their root nodes being duplicates .",
    "pml document management in highly dynamic environments in epc network systems is a hard task . in this environment , documents change very frequently , both in content and structure .",
    "additionally , the same information may be represented in documents from different sources , leading to ( partial or total ) overlap of documents .",
    "dealing with these overlaps and/or duplications in a dynamic environment is challenging in many aspects . in this paper , we improve the method of xml fuzzy duplicate detection proposed by leitao in accordance with the features of pml document , and propose a method of measuring the similarity of pml documents based on bayesian network . it",
    "not only considers the duplicate status of children , but rather the probability of descendants being duplicates .",
    "with respect to the features of pml , while measuring the similarity , we firstly reduce the redundancy data except information of epc .",
    "on the basis of this , the bayesian network model derived from the structure of the pml documents being compared is constructed . and",
    "this model has taken into consideration not only the epc values contained in the pml but also their internal structure .",
    "then the similarity between two pml documents could be deduced .",
    "finally , simulations show the proposed algorithm is able to maintain high precision and recall values .",
    "the remainder of the article is organized as follows . in sec.2",
    ", we describe the background of the remainder of the article is organized as follows . in sec.2 , we describe the background of pml documents and bayesian network . in sec.3 ,",
    "we present the bayesian network for pml similarity computation , including the relationship between pml documents similarity and bayesian network probability , redundancy reduction of pml documents , bayesian network model for pml documents and the algorithm of constructing bayesian network model , and elucidate how pml similarity measure is performed using the proposed bayesian network .",
    "section 4 presents our prototype and simulative tests .",
    "section 5 concludes the paper and outlines future research directions .",
    "in order to stress the need for relatedness assessment in pml document comparisons , we consider the example in fig .",
    "1(a ) and fig . 2(a ) .",
    "it depicts pml document of data captured by rfid readers .",
    "rfid readers capture the electronic product code stored on the individual auto - id compliant tags ( e.g. 1:2.24.404 and 1:12.8.128 ) .",
    "pml document should enable to elaborate the process that rfid readers acquire data , including where is the certain rfid reader , which is identified by a unique identifier ( e.g. 1:4.16.36 ) , when certain tags in its read range are observed ( e.g. 2002 - 11 - 06t13:04:34 - 06:00 ) and so on .",
    "each such observation might need to be labeled with the command that was issued to trigger the observation ( e.g. read_pallet_tags_only ) and a unique label to reference a certain observation ( e.g. @xmath0 ) .",
    "within the epc network , rfid readers are one of the main components .",
    "the data they capture are routed within the epc network from readers to savant as described by @xcite ( the savant is a middleware system which requests from upper application and receives data from sensors . ) , from one savant to other , from savant to the epc information service . to standardize the mark - up of those captured data , pml document needs to adequately represent the observed values .",
    "xml documents represent hierarchically structured information and can be modeled as ordered labeled trees ( olts)@xcite . in the olts , nodes represent xml elements and are labeled with corresponding element tag names .",
    "element attributes mark the nodes of their containing elements .",
    "some studies have considered olts with distinct attribute nodes , labeled with corresponding attribute names@xcite . attribute nodes appear as children of their encompassing element nodes , sorted by attribute name , and appearing before all sub - element siblings@xcite .",
    "so we reference the xml document s olts and describe the pml document s olts in fig.1 ( b ) and fig.2 ( b ) .",
    "element / attribute values are also considered in the comparison process following the application of structureandcontent . as an example , consider the tree representation of two pml elements represented in fig .",
    "1(b ) and fig .",
    "2(b ) ( nodes are labeled by their pml tag name and an index for future reference ) .",
    "both trees represent xml elements named sensor .",
    "they nest further xml elements representing i d and observation .",
    "an observation consists of i d , command , datetime and tag , represented as children pml elements of observation . and",
    "a tag also consists of i d and other elements which might involve other children elements .",
    "all of those elements have a text node which stores the actual data .",
    "for instance , datetime has a text node containing ` 2002 - 11 - 06 t 13:04:34 - 06:00 ' as string value .",
    "bayesian networks ( bns ) provide a graphical formalism to explicitly represent the dependencies among the variables of a domain , thus providing a concise specification of a joint probability distribution as described by @xcite .",
    "the network structure of the bayesian network ( belief networks or bayes nets for short ) , belonging to the family of probabilistic graphical models ( gms ) , is an dag ( directed acyclic graph ) , where each node represents an attribute or data variables and the arcs represent the probabilistic dependency relation between attribute nodes .",
    "the relationship of complex variables in specific issues is represented by a network structure , reflecting dependency relationship between variables in the problem areas .",
    "in addition to the dag structure , which is often considered as the `` qualitative '' part of the model , one needs to specify the `` quantitative '' parameters of the model .",
    "the parameters are described in a manner which is consistent with a markovian property , where the conditional probability distribution ( cpd ) at each node depends only on its parents as presented by @xcite .",
    "a mathematic model is used to express bayesian network as follows : @xmath1 the set of collection of random variables is defined as : @xmath2 the collection of directed edges is defined as : @xmath3 the set of conditional probability distribution , namely conditional probability table is defined as : @xmath4 consider the following example that illustrates some of the characteristics of bns .",
    "the example shown in figure 3 presents the bayesian network of two pml documents being the rooted node of sensor , which have the same data structure but different value .",
    "firstly , it considers tag similarity , represented by the variable tag ( denoted by st ) might result from @xmath5 similarity , represented by the variable @xmath5 ( denoted by @xmath6 ) .",
    "secondly , observation similarity represented by the variable observation ( denoted by so ) might result from datetime similarity represented by the variable datetime ( denoted by sd ) . in the final case , it is reasonable to assume that sensor similarity represented by the variable sensor ( denoted by ss ) will be determined by so and i d similarity , represented by the variable i d ( denoted by si ) .",
    "all variables are binary ; thus , they are either true ( denoted by `` t '' ) or false ( denoted by `` f '' ) .        for example , the cpts of tag and id are listed in table 1 and table 2 .",
    "p(si ) presents the same probability of two i d s and",
    "p(st ) presents the same probability of two tags .    .",
    "same probability of two i d s [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     and theses data sets are extracted from pml data generator designed by our project team , which enable to generate different pml documents in accordance with our needs . in the generator , the parameters of self - definition include ( 1 ) amount of tag element , ( 2 ) type of tag element , and ( 3 ) value of i d element . hence , dataset 1 represents the scenario where we do nt understand the structure and duplicate of pml documents , and all of theses pml documents are randomly generated .",
    "dataset 2 , 3 , 4 are used to show the impact of different degree of duplicates to timing result and effectiveness of our algorithm .",
    "these tests were done on a thinkpad x220i computer with dual processor cpu of core i3 2370 m processors , running at 2.4 ghz .",
    "all simulative approaches , include measure of timing result and effectiveness , were implemented by us in matlab .",
    "and we know that the timing results of algorithm could be influence by different computer . in this section we describe some simulations that measure the pml similarity in terms of timing results and effectiveness on data , which is followed xml schemas of pmlcore.xsd and identifier.xsd and is generated randomly by pml generator .",
    "we have three main goals in our simulations :    * probability mean  the average of duplicate probability.we use the range of probability mean to evaluate what is the value of final probability that could be considered as duplicates for two pml documents . *",
    "time performance ",
    "the timing result of our algorithm for different amounts of duplicate data.we use the data to evaluate the timing result of our algorithm in accordance to different scenarios . *",
    "precision and recall values  the standard for evaluating information retrieval methods.we use recall / precision curve @xcite to evaluate the impact of various sizes of the same elements in pml documents on effectiveness      firstly , we define the prior probability as follow .",
    "@xmath7)=sim(id_{i},id_{j})=\\\\ \\nonumber 1-\\frac{compare(id_{i},id_{j})}{max(|id_{i}|,|id_{i}|)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath8 presents the comparison of strings @xmath9 and @xmath10 and the result is the integer value of difference of two strings .",
    "@xmath11 is the length of string i d .",
    "so the result of @xmath12 is the maximum value of two strings . to measure effectiveness",
    ", we use the commonly used precision and recall as presented by @xcite .",
    "precision measures the percentage of correctly identified duplicates contained over the total set of objects determined as duplicates by the system .",
    "recall measures the percentage of duplicates correctly identified by the system over the total set of duplicate objects as presented by @xcite .",
    "* simulation 1 * to measure what the value of final probability could be considered duplicates for two pml documents by using data set 1 .",
    "firstly , we should determine whether a distribution of statistics follows a normal distribution compared with the probability density function of normal distribution graph .",
    "the frequency histograms are constructed in figure 7 .",
    "secondly , a normal distribution could be verified by figure 8 . with the increase of data set , the discrete points close to the inclined straight line segments .",
    "so the conclusion is that the values of final probability approximate normal distribution .        finally , we perform three sets of random experiments , the average of the data show as follows .        from the figure 9",
    ", the average mostly concentrates in the [ 0.4095 , 0.4435 ] .",
    "so only objects whose duplicate probability is above or equal to the value range [ 0.4095 , 0.4435 ] are considered similarity .",
    "* simulation 2 * to evaluate the timing result of our algorithm in accordance to different scenarios by using dataset 1 - 4 . from the figure 10 ,",
    "the time to compare pairs of pml documents of various sizes grows in an almost perfect linear fashion with size and duplicate of pml documents .",
    "* simulation 3 * to evaluate the impact of various sizes and duplicates pml documents on effectiveness .",
    "the simulation was performed to determine the impact of the quality of the data being processed on the performance of the bayesian network model .",
    "figure 11 shows the results for varying the probabilities of @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "in this paper , we introduce the function and application area of pml documents and illustrate the necessity for computing the similarity of pml documents in epc network .",
    "then we propose an approach for measuring the similarity of pml documents based on bayesian network .",
    "with respect to the feature of pml , while measuring the similarity , we firstly reduce the redundancy data except information of epc .",
    "on the basis of this , the bayesian network model derived from the structure of the pml documents being compared is constructed . and",
    "this model has accounted for both the i d values contained in the pml and their internal structure .",
    "then the similarity between two pml documents could be deduced .",
    "finally , the simulations evaluate the value range of similarity , timing result and the effectiveness of the similarity measure .",
    "we intend to further validate our similarity measures by considering real - world data , which could exist errors , such as missing data ( e.g. lack of epc ) or incompleteness data ( e.g. the epc less than 96 bit ) and so on , so we still need to validate this observation .",
    "another issue we should intend to consider is the scalability ether in space or in time . scaling to large amounts of pml document with the help of external memory units also needs to be studied in the future .",
