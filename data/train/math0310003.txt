    "classically , there have been two main directions in the study of hypergeometric functions .",
    "the first of these is to study the properties of a particular series , analyze its convergence , compute its values at some specific points providing combinatorial identities , give integral representations , and find relations with other series of the same kind . here",
    "one could refer to well known works of gauss and euler , for instance ,  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the other classical avenue of research is to find a differential equation that our hypergeometric function satisfies , and to study all the solutions of that equation .",
    "this approach was pioneered by kummer , who showed that the gauss hypergeometric function : @xmath0 \\\\ & = 1 + \\frac{ab}{c}\\frac{z}{1!}+ \\frac{a(a+1)b(b+1)}{c(c+1)}\\frac{z^2}{2!}+ \\frac{a(a+1)(a+2)b(b+1)(b+2)}{c(c+1)(c+2)}\\frac{z^3}{3!}+\\cdots\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] satisfies the differential equation : @xmath1 kummer went on to find all of the solutions of this equation ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "he constructed twenty - four ( gauss ) series that , whenever  @xmath2 ,  @xmath3 and  @xmath4 are not integers , provide representations of two linearly independent solutions to the gauss equation , that are valid in any region of the complex plane .",
    "riemann also had a fundamental influence in this field @xcite .",
    "for more historical details on hypergeometric functions , and a comprehensive treatment of their classical theory , see @xcite .    both of these approaches have been tried for bivariate hypergeometric series . in his article",
    "@xcite , erdlyi gives a complete set of solutions for the following system of two hypergeometric equations in two variables : @xmath5 where  @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this is the system of equations for appell s function  @xmath8 , and for generic values of the parameters  @xmath2 ,  @xmath3 ,  @xmath9 and  @xmath4 , erdlyi constructs more than  @xmath10 fully supported series solutions through contour integration . by a _",
    "fully supported series _",
    ", we mean a series such that the convex hull of the exponents of the monomials appearing with nonzero coefficient contains a full dimensional cone . the holonomic rank of this system , that is , the dimension of its space of complex holomorphic solutions around a nonsingular point , is  @xmath11 .",
    "another interesting system of two second order hypergeometric equations in two variables is : @xmath12 this is the system of equations for horn s function  @xmath13 , and its holonomic rank is  @xmath14 .",
    "erdlyi notes that , in a neighborhood of a given point , three linearly independent solutions of this system can be obtained through contour integral methods .",
    "he also finds a fourth linearly independent solution : the puiseux monomial  @xmath15 .",
    "he remarks that the existence of this elementary solution is puzzling , especially since it can not be expressed using contour integration , and offers no explanation for its occurrence .",
    "one of the goals of this article is to give a formula for the rank of a system of two hypergeometric equations in two variables when the parameters are generic ( cf .",
    "theorem [ thm : main - theorem ] ) .",
    "we will explain why the system for appell s  @xmath8 has rank  @xmath11 and why the very similar system for horn s  @xmath13 has rank  @xmath14 .",
    "we will also show that puiseux polynomial solutions are a commonplace phenomenon .",
    "moreover , we will prove that these systems of hypergeometric equations are holonomic for a generic choice of the parameters .",
    "our starting point are the ideas of gel@xmath16fand , graev and retakh  @xcite about the @xmath17-series associated with lattices , and how they relate to horn series .",
    "notice that @xmath17-series as defined in  @xcite are fully supported , and they do not account for the puiseux polynomial solutions of horn systems .",
    "holomorphic series solutions to a horn system are equivalent to solutions of corresponding hypergeometric recursions ( see section  [ sec : timur ] , specifically equation ( [ horn - recurrencies ] ) ) , thus our study of puiseux polynomial solutions also characterizes the solutions to these recurrences that have finite support .    finally , since we will be dealing with lattices that are not necessarily saturated , we also need to study the generalized hypergeometric systems associated with lattices ( more general than the @xmath18-hypergeometric systems of gel@xmath16fand , kapranov and zelevinsky ) . we show that , for generic parameters , these systems are also holonomic , without restriction on the number of variables or rank of the corresponding lattice , and prove the expected formula for their generic holonomic rank .",
    "in order to accommodate two different sets of variables , we denote by  @xmath19 the weyl algebra with generators @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and by  @xmath22 the weyl algebra whose generators are @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "we set @xmath25 for @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , for @xmath28 .",
    "we also define @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "when the meaning is clear , we will drop many of the subindices to simplify the notation .",

    "we let @xmath44 where @xmath45 the operators  @xmath46 are the _ horn operators _ corresponding to the lattice @xmath47 and the parameter vector  @xmath4 .",
    "we call @xmath48 the order of the operator  @xmath46 .",
    "the _ horn system _ is the following left ideal of  @xmath22 : @xmath49    now denote by  @xmath50 the columns of the matrix  @xmath51 .",

    "this is not necessarily true if  @xmath67",
    ".    lattice ideals and toric ideals have been extensively studied ( see , for instance ,  @xcite ,  ) .",
    "lattice basis ideals were introduced in  @xcite .",
    "there is a natural system of differential equations arising from a toric ideal  @xmath68 and a parameter vector .",
    "this system , called the _ @xmath18-hypergeometric system with parameter  @xmath69 _ , is defined as : @xmath70 from now on we will use the notation @xmath71 to mean @xmath72 .",
    "@xmath18-hypergeometric systems were first defined by gel@xmath16fand , graev and zelevinsky in  @xcite , and their systematic analysis was started by gel@xmath16fand , kapranov and zelevinsky ( see , for instance ,  @xcite ) .",
    "saito , sturmfels and takayama have used grbner deformations in the weyl algebra to study @xmath18-hypergeometric systems ( see  @xcite ) . in this article , we will extend this approach to the case of horn systems .",
    "gel@xmath16fand , graev and retakh have also considered the _ hypergeometric system associated with the lattice @xmath73 _ , which is defined to be the left @xmath19-ideal : @xmath74 we now introduce the @xmath19-ideal  @xmath75 , that is very closely related to the horn system @xmath76 : @xmath77 the results in section  [ sec : translation ] imply that , for generic  @xmath4 , there is a vector space isomorphism between the solution spaces of @xmath78 and  @xmath75 .",
    "thus , we have two points of view to study horn hypergeometric functions .",
    "we also call  @xmath75 a horn system , when the context is clear .",
    "we have defined the horn operators using falling factorials because this formulation will make clearer the relationship between @xmath78 and  @xmath75 , but it is just as legal to define horn systems using rising factorials , as it is done in many classical sources .",
    "for instance , the horn and appell systems from the previous section naturally lend themselves to a rising factorial formulation .",
    "this is not really a difficulty , since switching between rising and falling factorials in the definition of horn systems is a matter of shifting the parameters by integers .",
    "it is a well known result of adolphson  @xcite that , for generic parameters  @xmath69 , the holonomic rank of the @xmath18-hypergeometric system equals the normalized volume  @xmath79 of the convex hull of the columns of  @xmath18 , which is also the degree of the toric ideal  @xmath68 . our goal is to obtain an explicit expression in this spirit for bivariate horn systems .",
    "previous work in this direction required very strong assumptions ( see  @xcite ) .",

    "the following is the main result in this article , which follows from corollary  [ corol : formula ] and theorems  [ thm : hbc - is - holonomic ] ,  [ thm : rank - formula ] , and  [ hornholonom ] .",

    "moreover , @xmath89 where the first summation runs over linearly dependent pairs  @xmath83 ,  @xmath84 of rows of  @xmath40 that lie in opposite open quadrants of  @xmath90 , and the second summation runs over linearly independent such pairs",
    ".    we can also give an explicit basis for the solution space of @xmath76 ( and of  @xmath75 ) ( theorem  [ thm : sol - basis ] ) , and compute the exact dimension of the subspace of puiseux polynomial solutions ( theorem [ thm : puiseux ] ) .",
    "the horn system @xmath78 is always compatible , even if  @xmath4 is not generic , in the sense that its solution space is always nonempty .",
    "first of all , the constant zero function is always a solution of @xmath78 , since this system is homogeneous .",
    "moreover , as we will see in section  [ sec : translation ] , all the solutions of the @xmath18-hypergeometric system  @xmath91 are solutions of @xmath75 , and these can be transformed into solutions of @xmath78 ( see corollary  [ coro : vector - space - iso ] ) , so that , under the assumptions that @xmath92 is  @xmath93 of full rank  @xmath35 ,  @xmath94 , with all column sums equal to zero , @xmath78 always has nonzero solutions , since @xmath91 always has nonzero solutions ( its solution space has dimension at least @xmath95 , see  ( * ? ? ? * theorem 3.5.1 ) ) .",
    "it is easy to understand how the horn system @xmath78 changes if we choose a new parameter vector  @xmath96 , as long as @xmath97 . as a matter of fact , if @xmath98 , for some @xmath99 , then it is easy to see that  @xmath100 is a solution of @xmath101 if and only if  @xmath102 is a solution of @xmath78 .",
    "notice also that the system  @xmath75 depends only on  @xmath69 , so that @xmath103 if @xmath104 .    a change in  @xmath105 can , instead , alter the solution space of @xmath78 ( and  @xmath75 ) in dramatic ways .",
    "for instance , it could become infinite - dimensional , as the following example shows .    the horn system defined by the operators",
    "@xmath106 is not holonomic if @xmath107 indeed , a holonomic system of equations can only have a finite - dimensional space of analytic solutions .",
    "however , since for @xmath108 the operator @xmath109 can be factored out of each of the operators in  ( [ eqn : nonholo2dim ] ) , it follows that any function which is annihilated by @xmath109 is a solution to  ( [ eqn : nonholo2dim ] ) .",
    "thus for any smooth univariate function  @xmath110 the product  @xmath111 satisfies  ( [ eqn : nonholo2dim ] ) .",
    "notice that for generic values of the parameters @xmath112 the system  ( [ eqn : nonholo2dim ] ) is holonomic .",
    "one of its solutions is given by the gauss function @xmath113.$ ] of course , similar examples can be given in any dimension .",
    "we could also ask what happens if we choose another matrix  @xmath114 such that @xmath115 .",
    "even if  @xmath116 , so that  @xmath40 and  @xmath114 are two gale duals of  @xmath18 , the associated horn systems could have different holonomic rank , as we see in example  [ ex : diff - ranks ] .",

    "this can be verified for specific values of  @xmath4 using the computer algebra system _ macaulay 2 _",
    "however , by theorem [ thm : splitting - series ] , these two hypergeometric systems share all fully supported solutions .    notice that the definition of @xmath76 makes sense even if  @xmath92 is a square matrix , or if the rows of  @xmath92 do not add up to zero , or even if  @xmath92 does not have full rank . as a matter of fact , we will need to consider such horn systems on our way to proving results about the case when  @xmath92 is  @xmath93 of full rank  @xmath35 , @xmath120 , and the rows of  @xmath92 add up to zero .",
    "many of the examples will also concern horn systems with  @xmath121 .",
    "we remark that if  @xmath92 is square and nonsingular , then  @xmath75 is a system of differential equations with constant coefficients , not depending on  @xmath4 .",
    "in this section we collect some results about lattice ideals and lattice basis ideals that will be necessary to study horn systems .",

    ", we could use any field of characteristic  @xmath127 instead of  @xmath128 , but later on , when we talk about complex holomorphic solutions of differential equations , we will need our field to be the complex numbers .",
    "we let  @xmath18 be any @xmath129 integer matrix such that @xmath130 .",
