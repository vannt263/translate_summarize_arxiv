    "the understanding of insulating behavior has been revolutionized by the landmark discovery of topological insulators ( ti ) , @xcite which are bulk band insulators with spin - orbit induced conducting states on the surface ( 3d ) or edge ( 2d ) .",
    "these states are a manifestation of @xmath0 _ topological _ order : topology guarantees the existence in equilibrium of a crossing of bands connecting time - reversal invariant momenta , which is robust against smooth time - reversal invariant perturbations such as non - magnetic disorder and electron - electron interactions . the surface states of 3d ti are described by a rashba hamiltonian @xcite with dirac - cone like dispersion , and are gapless and chiral , with a well - defined spin texture ( spin - momentum locking . ) they carry a @xmath1 berry phase , which protects against back - scattering and thus localization , and is associated with klein tunneling , a half - quantized anomalous hall effect @xcite and a giant kerr effect .",
    "@xcite nontrivial topology makes ti a platform for the observation of majorana fermions @xcite and for topological quantum computing .",
    "@xcite    the rise of topological insulators is following a close parallel to the rise of graphene a short time ago .",
    "three - dimensional topological insulators have grown from non - existence to a vastly developed mature field involving hundreds of researchers practically overnight . within this time span ,",
    "chiral surface states started out as a mere theoretical concept , were predicted to exist in several materials and were subsequently imaged.@xcite unlike graphene , the hamiltonian of topological insulators is a function of the real spin , rather than a sublattice pseudospin degree of freedom .",
    "this implies that spin dynamics is qualitatively different from graphene .",
    "moreover , the twofold valley degeneracy of graphene is not present in topological insulators . despite the apparent similarities ,",
    "the study of topological insulators is thus not a simple matter of translating results known from graphene . due to the dominant spin - orbit interaction ,",
    "topological insulators are also qualitatively different from ordinary two - dimensional spin - orbit coupled semiconductors .",
    "the topological order present in ti is a result of one - particle physics . in light of this , we recall that electron - electron interactions modify the effective mass , heat capacity , and ground state energy of solids , as well as the response of solids to external magnetic fields .",
    "@xcite in fact , electron - electron interactions can lead to spontaneous magnetism in itinerant electron systems .",
    "the best - known example of this effect is pauli paramagnetism in interacting electron systems .",
    "it is known from fermi liquid theory that the pauli paramagnetic susceptibility is enhanced by electron - electron interactions .",
    "this can be derived rigorously using various types of linear - response formalisms , such as diagrammatic kubo linear response theory , the keldysh kinetic equation formalism , or density - matrix formalisms based on the liouville equation .",
    "interaction effects in systems with _",
    "strong spin - orbit interactions _ have been studied in 2d ti @xcite and 3d ti , @xcite and previously in spin - orbit coupled semiconductors .",
    "@xcite in topological insulators the focus has been on phenomena in equilibrium and in the quantum hall regime .    in the mean time , transport in topological insulators has made enormous strides recently .",
    "@xcite in initial experimental efforts , it appeared impossible to identify any signatures whatsoever of the elusive surface states . yet",
    "lately experimental work on transport in topological insulators has begun to advance at a brisk pace , and is without doubt entering its heyday , in the way arpes and stm work did two years ago .",
    "a beautiful experiment @xcite recently detected the topological surface states of bi@xmath2se@xmath3 , in which sb was partially substituted for bi to reduce the bulk carrier density to @xmath4@xmath5 . at large magnetic fields",
    "the surface states were clearly seen , with shubnikov - dehaas oscillations depending only on the perpendicular magnetic field , and oscillatory features growing with increasing field .",
    "another work showed that carrier densities can be tuned over a wide range with a back gate .",
    "@xcite a more recent experimental breakthrough @xcite investigated surface transport in thin films of bi@xmath2se@xmath3 of thickness @xmath6 10 nm , observing landau levels that evolve continuously from electron - like to hole - like . in another breakthrough , kim _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied bi@xmath2se@xmath3 surfaces in samples with thicknesses of @xmath7 nm , using a gate electrode to remove bulk carriers entirely and take both surfaces through the dirac point simultaneously .",
    "ambipolar transport was observed with with well - defined @xmath8 and @xmath9 regions , together with a minimum conductivity of the order of @xmath10 , reflecting the presence of electron and hole puddles .",
    "exciting developments in hgte transport have also been reported .",
    "@xcite    due to spin - momentum locking , the charge current flowing on the surface of a ti is intimately linked to its spin polarization .",
    "@xcite firstly , it is evident that an _ out - of plane _ spin polarization can be generated by a magnetic field or magnetization . however , an _ in - plane _ magnetic field can not generate an in - plane spin polarization for a dirac cone : it simply shifts the origin of the cone and can be removed by a gauge transformation.@xcite on the other hand , the combination of spin - momentum locking plus an electric field can be understood as a net effective magnetic field , which is in the plane of the ti , and generates an in - plane spin polarization .",
    "this paper presents a study of the role of electron - electron interactions in topological insulators in an electric field , and their effect on the spin polarization generated electrically _ in _ the plane of the ti .",
    "a fundamental question is whether basic ti phenomenology survives interactions _ out of equilibrium_. it is known that in transport topology only protects against _ back_-scattering .",
    "topological protection stems from time reversal symmetry , whereas transport is inherently irreversible .",
    "therefore robustness against electron - electron interactions in equilibrium does not translate into the same robustness in transport .",
    "i will demonstrate that the effect of interactions can be absorbed by a renormalization of the non - interacting charge conductivity and spin polarization , and the response is qualitatively the same .",
    "topological insulator phenomenology therefore remains unchanged by electron - electron interactions in the steady state .",
    "a multiband matrix formulation is imperative to capture interband dynamics and disorder effects , which give a nontrivial factor of two to the renormalization factor appearing in the charge current and spin polarization .",
    "this paper uses an alternative matrix formulation of linear response theory , which contains the same physics as conventional approaches and is potentially more transparent , relying on the quantum liouville equation in order to derive a kinetic equation for the density matrix .",
    "this theory was first discussed for graphene monolayers @xcite and bilayers , @xcite and was recently extended to topological insulators including the full scattering term to linear order in the impurity density .",
    "@xcite peculiarities of topological insulators , such as the absence of backscattering , which reflects the @xmath1 berry phase and leads to klein tunneling , are built into this theory in a transparent fashion . in this work , the formalism of ref .",
    "is extended to account for electron - electron interactions via a mean - field approach . since transport in non - interacting systems",
    "was studied in that work , only minimal overlaps required for consistency have been retained in this article .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath11 so that electron - electron _ scattering _ is absent . the theory assumes @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the fermi energy , located in the surface conduction band , and @xmath14 the momentum relaxation time .",
    "the physics considered here is distinct from spin - coulomb drag , @xcite which requires electron - electron _ scattering _ , and from previous work on transport in _ non - interacting _ ti .",
    "@xcite    electron - electron interaction effects have also been studied in graphene transport .",
    "@xcite the interaction physics discussed here is to be distinguished from that of graphene , since , as stated above , graphene is a multivalley system , and its hamiltonian is a function of the pseudospin , due to the sublattice degree of freedom , rather than the real spin .",
    "it is also important to realize that the mean - field hartree - fock treatment of interactions is particularly advantageous in topological insulators , because formulating a large-@xmath15 renormalization group expansion is a challenging task .",
    "this is because , whereas in graphene the spin and valley degeneracies yield @xmath16 , but in topological insulators @xmath17 .",

    "solving for @xmath188 introduces a factor of @xmath189 , which is canceled by @xmath190 in the 2d volume element .",
    "thus , 2d physics and ti linear dispersion combine to ensure the renormalization is density independent .",
    "the renormalization reflects the interplay of spin - momentum locking and many - body correlations .",
    "a spin at @xmath67 feels the effect of two competing interactions .",
    "the coulomb interaction between bloch electrons with @xmath67 and @xmath126 tends to align a spin at @xmath67 with the spin at @xmath126 , equivalent to a @xmath191-rotation  hence the driving term in eq .",

    "the total mean - field interaction tends to align the spin at @xmath67 with the sum of all spins at all @xmath126 , and @xmath193 encapsulates the amount by which the spin at @xmath67 is tilted as a result of the mean - field interaction with all other spins on the fermi surface .",
    "the effective field @xmath194 tends to align the spin with itself . as a result of this latter fact , out of equilibrium , an electrically - induced spin polarization is already found in the non - interacting system @xcite .",
    "given that the spins at @xmath67 and @xmath126 are in the plane , interactions tilt the spin at @xmath67 in the direction of the spin at @xmath126 . thus far the argument helps one understand why , if there is no spin polarization to start with , electron - electron interactions do not give rise to a spin polarization .",
    "the mean - field result is zero , so there is no overall tilt on any one spin due to the spins of the remaining electrons .",
    "interactions tend to align electron spins in the direction of the existing polarization .",
    "the effective @xmath191-rotation explains the counterintuitive observation that the renormalization is related to interband dynamics , originating as it does in @xmath112 .",
    "many - body interactions give an effective @xmath67-dependent magnetic field @xmath195 , such that for @xmath161 the spins @xmath196 and @xmath197 are rotated in opposite directions . due to spin - momentum locking ,",
    "a tilt in the spin becomes a tilt in the wave vector : spin dynamics create a feedback effect on charge transport , renormalizing the conductivity .",

    "]    i will discuss next the magnitude of this renormalization in currently known topological insulators .",
    "several materials were predicted to be topological insulators in three dimensions .",
    "the first was the alloy bi@xmath202sb@xmath203,@xcite followed by the tetradymite semiconductors bi@xmath2se@xmath3 , bi@xmath2te@xmath3 and sb@xmath2te@xmath3 .",
    "@xcite these materials have a rhombohedral structure composed of quintuple layers oriented perpendicular to the trigonal @xmath204-axis .",
    "the covalent bonding within each quintuple layer is much stronger than weak van der waals forces bonding neighboring layers .",
    "the semiconducting gap is approximately 0.3 ev , and the ti states are present along the ( 111 ) direction . in particular bi@xmath2se@xmath3 and bi@xmath2te@xmath3 have long been known from thermoelectric transport as displaying sizable peltier and seebeck effects , and their high quality has ensured their place at the forefront of experimental attention .",
    "@xcite initial predictions of the existence of chiral surface states were confirmed by first principles studies of bi@xmath2se@xmath3 , bi@xmath2te@xmath3 , and sb@xmath2te@xmath3 .",
    "@xcite in the current generation of topological insulators , @xmath42 is small .",
    "currently @xmath30 ranges between 30 and 100 ( 200 for bi@xmath2te@xmath3 ) , making @xmath42 between 0.14 and 0.46 .",
    "the theoretical treatment adopted in this work is therefore applicable , and interactions provide a correction to the steady - state response . a plot of @xmath199 for @xmath200 is shown in fig .",

    "i note that heusler alloys were recently predicted to have topological surface states , @xcite as well as chalcopyrites , @xcite yet more work is needed to establish the size of @xmath42 in these materials .    at this stage in topological insulator research ,",
    "the results found in this work are interesting for conceptual reasons , since they demonstrate that ti phenomenology is unchanged by interactions .",
    "the electrical conductivity / spin polarization has the same form as in the non - interacting case , with a renormalization that can be incorporated into a redefinition of the spin - orbit constant , or alternatively of the fermi velocity , and thus the density of states . for large @xmath42",
    "a non - perturbative treatment that goes beyond the random phase approximation is necessary , yet such a theory must await materials progress .",
    "in this context , i would like to note that the growth of new materials is a nontrivial issue , and obtaining high - quality samples where only the surface electrons can be accessed in transport has proved to be a difficult task .",
    "it is especially important to recall that future work may initially be hampered by factors such as roughness and dirt inherent in solid - state interfaces .",
    "in addition , it remains true that all current ti materials are effectively bulk _ metals _ because of their large unintentional doping  at present , bulk carriers are only removed temporarily by gating .",
    "discussing ti surface transport in such bulk - doped ti materials retains some ambiguity , since it necessarily involves complex data fitting and a series of assumptions required by the necessity of distinguishing bulk versus surface transport contributions .",
    "real progress is expected when surface ti transport can be carried out unambiguously , without any complications arising from the ( more dominant ) bulk transport channel .",
    "the immediate tasks facing experimentalists are getting the chemical potential in the gap without the aid of a gate , further experimental studies confirming ambipolar transport , and the measurement of a spin - polarized current .",
    "i have demonstrated that , from the point of view of the non - equilibrium spin polarizations and charge current , ti behavior remains intact in the presence of interactions with only quantitative modifications .",
    "the conductivity and spin polarization are renormalized by electron - electron interactions entering through a combination of interband dynamics and scattering .",
