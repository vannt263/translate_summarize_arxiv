    "follow - up observations found infrared excesses around other main - sequence stars , including @xmath8 pictoris .",

    "@xmath8 pictoris s disk is a prototype for a young , but nearly complete planetary system .",
    "identification of this disk was the first observational evidence of planetary systems outside our own .",
    "many nearby stars have been investigated using iras and iso to search for far - ir photospheric excesses , and a large number have been found ( lagrange  2000 ; backman  1993 ; chen  2005 and references therein ) . due to the large beam size of iras , far - ir observations of nearby stars such as @xmath8 pictoris , @xmath9 eradani , fomalhaut , and",
    "others have resulted in follow - up higher resolution ground based mid - ir observations that resolved their disks and probed their compositions ( lagrange  2000 ) .",
    "stars with far - ir excesses such as @xmath9 eradani may even harbor planets ( hatzes  2000 ) .    only a few main - sequence stars with mid - ir but no near - ir excesses have been detected .",
    "aumann & probst ( 1991 ) investigated nearby main - sequence stars using 12 @xmath0 m measurements from iras , but out of the @xmath10 stars investigated , only @xmath11 stars had colors unusual enough to warrant further investigation .",
    "follow up ground - based observations were conducted on @xmath12 stars at @xmath13 @xmath0 m to determine if the excess originated from the star .",
    "only @xmath8 pictoris and @xmath14 leporis exhibited mid - ir excesses ( aumann & probst 1991 ) .",
    "chen & jura ( 2001 ) measured a temperature of 370 k for the mid - ir excess in @xmath14 leporis and suggest that it is due to a massive asteroid belt .",
    "the excess in @xmath14 leporis originates at small radii , less than 6 au , and not at large radii , @xmath1540 au , unlike other stars such as @xmath8 pictoris which have large disks extending hundreds of au ( chen & jura 2001 ) .",
    "stars with higher disk temperatures have dust which is closer to the star , and the excess may be more analogous to the warm temperatures of asteroid belts than to the @xmath16k dust of kuiper belts .",

    "the evolutionary sequence of both inner and outer circumstellar disks from pre - main sequence to main - sequence is not well understood ( meyer & beckwith 2000 ) .",
    "lack of observational evidence of an evolutionary disk sequence is a major hindrance in the understanding of planetary formation .",
    "the reason for this lack of evidence is that only the nearest stars have been probed for circumstellar disks , and a relatively small number of stars with disks have been identified .",
    "it is estimated that at least 15% of nearby a - k main - sequence stars have dusty debris disks that were detectable to iras and iso sensitivities in the far - infrared ( lagrange  2000 ; backman & paresce 1993 ) .",

    "a total of @xmath50 new stellar classifications resulted from these observations .",
    "the stars were classified by eye using comparison spectra ( yamashita  1976 ) to within two comparison temperature classes of the atlas .",
    "there were @xmath51 stars too faint or featureless for classification .",
    "protostars may comprise a significant fraction of these unclassified objects because they have high extinctions and are optically faint .",
    "there are @xmath19@xmath52 stars in the osv that had previous spectral classifications in the literature , but most of them were saturated in glimpse so their mid - ir colors are , therefore , unreliable and are not included in this investigation .",
    "we were able to use 20 stars that had suitable glimpse colors and were previously classified in the literature .",
    "the positions of 38,734 glimpse point source catalog objects in the osv were matched against the positions of @xmath24mass point source catalog objects using the glimpse data reduction pipeline .",
    "we then matched the guide stars with the glimpse objects to produce v , j , h , k , [ 3.6 ] , [ 4.5 ] , [ 5.8 ] , [ 8.0 ] photometry for the 184 spectrally classified stars , although some objects lack photometry at one or more of the eight bandpasses .",
    "the gsc v - band photometry was extracted from photometric plates , and most stars have v - band uncertainties of @xmath19@xmath53 magnitudes , ( see the gsc documentation for more information ) .",
    "the eight photometric data points were fit with kurucz atlas9 models using temperatures and effective gravities corresponding to the nearest spectral type ( kurucz 1993 ) .",
    "since all of the stars lie within the solar circle , we adopt the solar metallicity models .",
    "the kurucz model surface fluxes were scaled by a factor , @xmath54 , so that the model k - band fluxes matched the observed k - band 2mass photometry .",
    "this scale factor represents @xmath55 , the ratio of the stellar radius squared over the distance to the star squared . adopting stellar radii appropriate for the observed spectral types ( de jager , c. & nieuwenhuijzen , h. ( 1987 ) , schmidt - kaler , th .",
    "( 1982 ) , johnson , h.l .",
    "( 1966 ) ) , we calculated a spectrophotometric distance to each star",
    ". these distances and their uncertainties estimated by taking into account the k - band photometric errors added in quadrature with an additional 15% uncertainty in the stellar radii are listed in the tables .",
    "the k - band measurements were used as the basis for the distance computation because the effects of extinction are nearly negligible at 2.2 @xmath0 m for most of our stars .",
    "our derived @xmath56 are all @xmath57 mag implying @xmath58 .",
    "the model atmospheres were reddened with variable amounts of extinction using the li & draine ( 2001 ) extinction curve , except in the mid - infrared ( @xmath59 @xmath0 m ) where the glimpse extinction results were used ( indebetouw 2005 ) .",
    "distance and extinction were fit iteratively as free parameters covering a grid of all reasonable values .",
    "the best fit parameters for each star are determined by the minimum of the @xmath60 statistic .",
    "modeling the star with the next earlier or later spectral type model available in the kurucz library ( i.e. , an a3 with an a0 or an a5 ) produced very similar reduced @xmath60 values .",
    "this allows small errors in classification to yield similar results .",
    "this also provides a check on classification .",
    "if a star is grossly misclassified the fit is poor and the classification is double checked .",
    "we performed a trial fitting procedure in which the effective temperatures and gravities of the stellar models were allowed to vary as free parameters ( i.e. , the program searched through the entire library of kurucz models to find a best fit ) . in nearly all cases , this method produced fits with lower @xmath60 , but this approach frequently converged upon temperature and gravity combinations which were grossly inconsistent with the observed spectral types .",
    "we found that there was often a degeneracy between the amount of extinction and the effective temperature , such that models with high temperatures and low extinctions yielded similar fits as models with low temperatures and high extinctions .",
    "we , therefore , chose to fix the effective temperatures and gravities of the models at value appropriate to the classified spectral type .    our data set consisted of @xmath61 main - sequence , giant , and supergiant stars with spectral types in the osv region .",
    "this sample included 20 stars with known spectral types from the literature which had reliable glimpse photometry as well as the 164 sources for which we obtained new classifications .",
    "we calculated ( @xmath62 ) color excesses , e(@xmath62 ) , by taking the differences between the kurucz photospheric model and the photometric ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "we chose the ( @xmath62 ) color because main - sequence stars should exhibit minimal color differences for these wavelengths .",
    "this method is similar to the method used by aumann & probst ( 1991 ) , in which @xmath63 from iras was used to identify warm disk candidates .",
    "figure  [ ek8 ] shows the e(@xmath62 ) distribution of stars with ( @xmath62 ) colors .",
    "the distribution shows a peak with a mean near e(@xmath62)=0.08 and a long tail toward larger excesses . the majority of stars , 110 , have e(@xmath62 ) between -0.2 and 0.35 with a mean of 0.08 and a dispersion of 0.09 .",
    "there were 33 stars with excesses larger than three times the dispersion of the main group , i.e. , with an e(@xmath62 ) @xmath15 0.35 .",
    "of these 33 stars with possible mid - ir excesses , three did not have measurements at [ 5.8 ] , and three of the stars had photometric uncertainties placing them within one standard deviation from an e(@xmath62 ) of 0.35 . in order to place a higher reliability on our detections we required that the stars have all four irac measurements , and an e(@xmath62 ) @xmath15 0.35 + 1 @xmath64 .",
    "table @xmath26 gives the colors and uncertainties for the 18 main sequence stars satisfying the above criteria , along with their spectral types and color uncertainties .",
    "hereafter , we refer to this group of stars as the  g18  sample .",
    "table 2 contains the stars that had an excess greater than 0.35 but did not meet all of our criteria for inclusion in table 1 .",
    "table 2 include stars which did not have all 4 irac measurements , or stars of early spectral type where the excess could be explained by thermal bremsstrahlung emission ( see 3.1 )",
    ".    figure  [ colore ] shows color - color plots of the stars with mid - ir excesses .",
    "panel a shows that the stars with a ( @xmath62 ) excess exhibit typical colors for the j , h , k near - infrared , but in panel d they show a significant deviation from the main - sequence which can not be explained by reddening .",
    "stars which could not be classified because of insufficient signal to noise in the optical spectra are shown only in panel b because almost all of these stars were in field 3 and did not have a v band measurement .",
    "triangles denote stars with a mid - ir excess that did not have v - band measurements .",
    "nearly all of the unidentified stars have @xmath45 much redder than the stars exhibiting mid - infrared excesses .",
    "these stars are likely to be highly extinguished and could be protostars .",
    "we analyzed the sed s of the 23 stars meeting the above  excess  criteria to determine whether phenomena other than disks could explain their mid - ir excesses .",
    "an unresolved close stellar companion can not produce the observed ir - excess .",
    "for most of the stars in table @xmath26 , their mid - ir excesses are only significant at [ 8.0 ] . a companion dwarf star of g , k , or m spectral class would raise the photometric flux at wavelengths @xmath43 @xmath26 @xmath0 m to a much greater degree than in the mid - ir , and such additional stellar components are inconsistent with the observed seds .",
    "even with stellar additional companions , the [ 8.0 ] measurements are still above expected photospheric levels . if any of our targets are multiple star systems , the primary star dominates the sed and a diskless companion would not contribute significantly to the sed .",
    "we investigated the glimpse residual images after psf fitting photometry and subtraction to rule out the possibility of systematic photometric errors .",
    "there were no significant residuals in the pixels at or surrounding each star s location .",
    "if larger photometric uncertainties in high background or highly structured background regions produced spurious signatures of ( @xmath62 ) excesses , we would expect to see as many stars with negative e(@xmath62 ) as positive e(@xmath62 ) .",
    "the distribution in figure  [ ek8 ] , however , shows only significant positive e(@xmath62 ) values . if the excess is due to only pah features , we would expect to see an enhancement at [ 3.6 ] , [ 5.8 ] , and [ 8.0 ] with respect to [ 4.5 ] since [ 4.5 ] is devoid of pah features .",
    "none of our excess sources exhibit this enhancement .",
    "thermal bremsstrahlung emission could possibly explain the e(@xmath62 ) values seen in the three early b stars and one o star listed in table 2 .",
    "these stars generally have all @xmath23 irac measurements in excess of the photosphere model values .",
    "an optically thin , thermal bremsstrahlung component was included in the modeling of their seds .",
    "the luminosity of the bremsstrahlung component was allowed to vary as a free parameter along with extinction and distance .",
    "these models with bremsstrahlung components fit the seds much better than the models with a single blackbody component .",
    "a blackbody component model with a single temperature is insufficient to fit all four measurements in excess of the photosphere .",
    "since these are ionizing stars and they fit a thermal bremsstrahlung model , we feel that this is the most likely explanation for the mid - ir excess of these four stars .    in conclusion",
    ", we note that the characteristic temperature of the blackbody component which creates a significant excess at 8 @xmath0 m , but not at shorter wavelengths , is @xmath19@xmath65 k because a 400 k blackbody peaks at 7.4 @xmath0 m . even the coolest known brown dwarfs ( burgasser et al .",
    "2000 ; burrows et al .",
    "2001 ) have temperatures of @xmath19@xmath66 k , and jupiter - like planets would be insufficiently luminous to create the observed infrared excesses . we conclude that the source of the mid - ir excess for the stars in table 1 is probably warm @xmath19@xmath65 k dust .",
    "an sed of @xmath8 pictoris , the prototype debris disk system , is shown in figure  [ beta ] for comparison to the excess candidates .",
    "figure  [ beta ] also shows the appropriate kurucz model .",
    "the sed is comprised of l ( 3.45 @xmath0 m ) , m ( 4.50 @xmath0 m ) , n ( 10.1 @xmath0 m ) , and q ( 20 @xmath0 m ) measurements from backman ( 1992 ) .",
    "the q band measurement was included so that the number of data points and the wavelength range was similar for both @xmath8 pictoris s model and the g18 stars ( 8 measurements and 4 free parameters in the model ) .",
    "the gsc and @xmath24mass measurements were used to model @xmath8 pictoris in a manner equivalent to that for the g18 stars . comparing the @xmath24mass photometry to near - ir measurements in the literature for @xmath8 pictoris shows that the near - ir photometry is consistent , but @xmath24mass data have much larger uncertainties , approximately 20@xmath48 .",
    "our spectrophotometric distance of 22.5 @xmath67 3.0 pc for @xmath8 pictoris is consistent with the hipparcos distance of 19.28 @xmath67 0.19 pc .    in order to estimate the sizes and temperatures of any dust disks for the g18 stars",
    ", we modeled the excess in each star as a single black body with temperature and fractional bolometric disk - to - star luminosity ratio , @xmath5 , as free parameters .",
    "this assumption , although simplistic , yields a rough approximation to the temperatures and @xmath5 of the dust disks , given the limited number of photometric points available .",
    "we searched a grid of blackbody temperatures and fractional disk luminosities to find best fits to the observed data .",
    "the temperature grid ranged from 100 k to 1100 k in steps of 1 k. this model was used to estimate the most probable parameters for the dust disks . for our model of @xmath8 pictoris",
    ", we found a single temperature for the excess to be 223@xmath68 k with the disk emitting 0.0019@xmath69 the luminosity of the star . in comparison , gillett ( 1986 )",
    "fit a single temperature blackbody to both mid - ir @xmath70 far - ir data , from which they infer a temperature of 103 k and a fractional luminosity of @xmath71 for @xmath8 pictoris . by fitting the mid - ir data alone we may be overestimating the disk temperature or just measuring the hotter inner portion of a larger disk .",
    "chen & jura ( 2001 ) found the color temperature of @xmath14 leporis to be 370 k , but they note that if they only fit the data at wavelengths greater than 10 @xmath0 m the disk temperature is better fit by a 230 k blackbody . backman ( 1992 ) use a two disk component for @xmath8 pictoris and find the inner disk temperatures to range from 200 - 400 + k depending on the model used .",
    "therefore the temperature we estimate for the debris disk is consistent with the range of disk temperatures given in backman  ( 1992 ) from a variety of more sophisticated models .",
    "we investigated the likelihood of other disk temperature / fractional luminosity combinations using a monte carlo simulation to determine the uncertainties on our derived disk and star parameters .",
    "the monte carlo code adds gaussian noise to each of the photometric data points ( based on their 1 @xmath64 photometric errors ) and then re - computes the most probable distance , visual extinction , blackbody temperature , and fractional blackbody luminosity .",

    "spectrophotometric uncertainties are primarily due to the assumption for the stellar radii uncertainties but are still well constrained . with only the visual measurement in the optical , there is some variation in extinction but for most stars the extinction is low . distributions for all the derived parameters are nearly gaussian .",
    "we then conducted the same analysis on our candidate stars .",
    "in a small fraction of the monte carlo simulations , @xmath43 5 @xmath48 for most stars , the best fit parameters require a fractional disk - to - star luminosity ratio greater than unity .",
    "we discard these monte carlo iterations as unphysical . in order for the luminosity of the disk to exceed the luminosity of the star",

    "lagrange  ( 2000 ) suggest a definition of debris disks using four criteria .",
    "these criteria include the bolometric fractional disk - to - star luminosity @xmath43 10@xmath6 , the mass of the gas and dust to be below 10@xmath7 , the dust mass significantly greater than the gas mass , and the grain destruction time much less than the stellar age .",
    "our limited data only allow comparisons based on the fractional bolometric luminosity .",
    "since @xmath5 @xmath43 0.1 for all of the g18 stars , these stars are debris disks or may be in a transitionary phase from protostellar to debris disk .",
    "although these stars have blue spectra which lack emission lines , except g284.3417 - 00.2049 which exhibits h@xmath8 emission , and appear to be main - sequence , we can not rule out h@xmath77 emission .",
    "weak h@xmath77 emission could be present , without h@xmath8 emission , which could imply that the star is pre main - sequence .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility that the stars may have primordial disks , but the disks are most likely to be debris disks .",
    "protostars typically have @xmath5 @xmath15 0.1 and debris disks typically have @xmath5 @xmath78 ( lagrange  2000 ; backman & paresce 1993 ) . since g284.1744 - 00.5141 , g284.0110 - 00.1208 , and g283.9773 - 00.3948 had a large number of their monte carlo iterations discarded because they were unphysical , their fractional disk luminosities may be greater than tabulated in table 3",
    ". these stars may be protostellar in nature since the models allow higher fractional luminosities , but their derived luminosities , omitting the unphysical simulations , are still consistent with debris disks .",
    "mid - ir spectral analysis of the stars in table 3 would reveal whether the 10 @xmath0 m silicate feature is present and would be a useful tool in the characterization of mid - ir excesses around main - sequence stars .",
    "the absorption ( embedded protostar ) , emission ( pre main - sequence ) , or lack of the 10 @xmath0 m silicate feature ( debris disk ) is loosely related to the evolutionary progression of a circumstellar disk ( kessler - silacci 2005 ) .",
    "however , the debris disks studied by kessler - silacci ( 2005 ) contained debris disks that only exhibited far - ir excesses .",
    "@xmath8 pictoris , a mid - ir debris disk system , does have a 10 @xmath0 m silicate emission feature .",
    "a useful comparison would be to determine whether this sample of mid - ir debris disk systems also exhibits a 10 @xmath0 m silicate emission feature .",
    "one especially interesting star that exhibited a mid - ir excess is g284.2642 - 00.3156 .",
    "the optical spectrum of this early type star is shown in figure  [ spec ] . using the ob star spectral atlas of walborn & fitzpatrick ( 1990 ) we classify this star as o4v((f ) ) .",
    "the classification is based on the relative strength of , , and the hydrogen balmer series .",
    "figure  [ spec ] shows that for this star weak 4634 - 40 - 42   appears in emission and a strong 4686   appears in absorption , which implies that the star is earlier than o5 .",
    "is present in absorption but is very weak , which implies that the star is later than o3 since an o3 lacks absorption .",
    "we did not see any 4058   emission or any significant 4604   or 4620   absorption , and 4686   is in absorption .",
    "these imply that the star is not a supergiant or giant .",
    "figure  [ ostar1 ] and figure  [ ostar4 ] show glimpse [ 3.6 ] and [ 8.0 ] images in the region surrounding g284.2642 - 00.3156 , including westerlund 2 .",
    "g284.2642 - 00.3156 is marked by the white box .",
    "the [ 3.6 ] image shows that g284.2642 - 00.3156 is surrounded by a grouping of faint stars which are partially blended with the o4 star at the 1.22 arcsecond angular resolution of the irac 3.6 @xmath0 m array .",
    "we determine a spectrophotometric distance to this star of 3233@xmath79 pc with a visual extinction of 5.63@xmath80 .",
    "the [ 8.0 ] image shows a nearly circular ring with radius of @xmath19@xmath81@xmath82 surrounding the o star . at a distance of 3.5 kpc ,",
    "the ring around the star would be 0.65 pc in diameter .",
    "this could be a wind blown shell illuminated by the star .",
    "there is also an irregular linear feature extending 29@xmath82 from the star in the northwest direction .",
    "this feature may be a nearby cloud illuminated by the star , or may trace the relative motion of the star through the inter - stellar medium surrounding westerlund 2 .    using the images of moffat  ( 1991 ) we identify g284.2642 - 00.3156 as their star @xmath83@xmath84 , which they find to be the most luminous star in the cluster .",
    "they type this star as an o7v , but they note that its absolute luminosity is brighter than that of an o7v .",
    "moffat  conclude that since the star appears isolated , it must , by color and luminosity arguments , be a supergiant if it lies at the distance of the cluster . our new classification results in an earlier spectral type with an extinction which is still consistent with cluster membership , but a distance that is not consistent with the 7.9 kpc by moffat ( 1991 ) .",
    "we note that the distance we find for the o4v((f ) ) star is inconsistent with the carraro & munari ( 2004 ) cluster distance of 6.3 kpc but still consistent with the wide variation of distances found for this cluster ( churchwell 2004 ) . if this star is a cluster member it would be the earliest known member .",
    "moffat  ( 1991 ) assumed a cluster age of 2 - 3 myr based on the presence of the o7 stars .",
    "the proximity of wr20b to the cluster may imply an older age of 3 - 5 myr if it is also a cluster member ( shara  1991 ) .",
    "the lifetime for an o4 is on the order of 3 myr ( for a 60 star with z=0.02;meynet 1994 ) .",
    "g284.2642 - 00.3156 lies 1 arcminute from the cluster center , which corresponds to a minimum projected separation of 1 pc if the star is at a distance of 3.5 kpc . in order to travel 1 pc in 3 myr or less , a modest space velocity of @xmath15 0.3 km s@xmath85",
    "is required .",
    "thus the reddening , and projected separation of the o4 star are consistent with cluster membership and origin .",
    "this implies that westerlund 2 may be younger and closer than previously thought .",
    "however , g284.2642 - 00.3156 may have been formed subsequent to the formation of westerlund 2 as a result of triggered star formation in surrounding molecular clouds ( deharveng  2005 , oey 2005 ) .",
    "further studies will determine if this star is a cluster member or a result of triggered star formation as well as the distance to this cluster .",
    "high resolution spectra of both the o4 star and westerlund 2 would allow a measurement if their relative radial velocities and would help establish whether this star is a cluster member .",
    "we found 33 stars which exhibited a mid - ir excess above photospheric levels in the field surrounding rcw@xmath3 .",
    "we combined our new spectral classifications with known literature classifications and optical , near , and mid - infrared photometry to model the spectral energy distributions of 184 stars .",
    "stars with mid - ir excesses span all spectral classes from b to early k. we modeled the excess for each star as a single component blackbody and found that for the g18 stars , the excess is consistent with a debris disk or some transitionary phase between primordial circumstellar disk and debris disk . for",
    "these @xmath84 stars the additional black body component was found to have fractional bolometric disk - to - star luminosity ratios , @xmath5 , ranging from ( 10@xmath6 to 10@xmath7 ) with temperatures ranging from 220 to 820 k. these temperatures and fractional disk - to - star luminosities are consistent with warm inner dust of debris disks which could be analogous to asteroid belt type objects .",
