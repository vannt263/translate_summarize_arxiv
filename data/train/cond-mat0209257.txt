    "the importance of magnetic inhomogeneities in understanding the complex phase diagrams of manganite systems like la@xmath6sr@xmath7mno@xmath2 @xcite becomes more and more evident , only to mention phase separation scenarios , chemical inhomogeneities or the recent description of the colossal magneto resistance effect as a griffith phase @xcite .",
    "electron spin resonance not only proves a very efficient tool in investigating phenomena like orbital ordering or inhomogeneities in the paramagnetic phase @xcite , but it is also very sensitive to changes in the magnetization behavior in the magnetically ordered regime @xcite .",
    "the details of the experimental setup and measurement procedures are described e.g.  in @xcite .",
    "the single crystal of la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 has been grown by the floating zone method described by urushibara and coworkers @xcite .",
    "a thin disc parallel to the ( 001)-plane has been prepared in order to control demagnetization effects .",
    "we measured at x - band frequency ( 9.4 ghz ) and rotated the sample with the external magnetic field @xmath8 applied within the disc s plane ( see inset of fig .",

    "at ( a ) 250 k , ( b ) 98 k and ( c ) 50 k revealing changes in symmetry with temperatures .",
    "inset of ( b ) shows the field derivation of the ferromagnetic - resonance absorption .",
    "the solid lines are fits using equation ( 1).,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the resonance spectra ( a typical one is shown in the inset of fig .  [ hresvsang](b ) ) reveal distortions of the main resonance above the resonance field similar to the ones observed in @xcite .",
    "we fitted the main resonance line with a lorentzian lineshape and observed an anisotropy in both the linewidth and the resonance field @xmath9 .",
    "the latter is shown in fig .",
    "[ hresvsang ] for three different temperatures : at about 95 k ( upon heating ) the system changes from orthorhombic ( @xmath3-phase ) to rhombohedral symmetry ( @xmath4-phase ) .",
    "the transition to the paramagnetic state takes place at @xmath10 k. in the @xmath3-phase at 50 k a twofold symmetry with an asymmetric broad minimum is found , which can be attributed to the deviation of the orthorhombic axes from cubic symmetry .    right above the structural transition at 98 k we observe an anisotropy which we describe by a superposition of a fourfold and a twofold symmetry using @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the rotation angle in the ( 001)-plane . far above the transition at 250 k",
    "again a twofold symmetry is found , indicating a uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy .",
    "the fit with eq .",
    "( 1 ) , however , includes still a fourfold contribution .",
    "the fits and fitparameters are shown in the corresponding panels of fig .  1 .",
    "besides the fact that the dominant uniaxial anisotropy parameter @xmath13 decreases , the fourfold parameter @xmath14 even becomes negative , indicating a change of hard and easy axes between 98 k and 250 k within the @xmath4-phase .",
    "a fourfold symmetry has also been reported by viglin _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite yielding anisotropy fields of @xmath15 oe by fitting with the usual angular dependence of cubic symmetry in the cube face plane @xcite .",
    "the low value of @xmath16 koe in contrast to the resonance observed in a sphere @xcite can be explained by taking into account the demagnetization effects for a disc @xcite .",
    "moreover , szymczak _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite report on fmr and magnetization measurements in the ( 110)-plane revealing an uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy and a change of the easy and hard directions concomitantly to the structural transition .",
    "therefore we measured the temperature dependence of the resonance line with the external field parallel to the three extrema at 0@xmath17 , 35@xmath17 and 90@xmath17 determined from the angular dependence in fig .",
    "[ hresvsang](b ) .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath9 for all three directions is shown in fig .",
    "[ hresvst ] : the anisotropy in the @xmath3-phase is almost constant for @xmath18 80 k , whereas for 80 k @xmath19 95 k a hysteretical behavior is observed , which reportedly accompanies the structural phase transition from orthorhombic to rhombohedral symmetry @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4-phase is characterized by a decrease in anisotropy and only within the narrow temperature range of 95 k @xmath19 130 k the angular dependence exhibits the three extrema as seen in fig .",
    "[ hresvsang](b ) . for @xmath20",
    "k the angular dependence reveals a twofold symmetry as in fig .",
    "[ hresvsang](a ) .",
    "in the temperature dependence this change is indicated at the crossover of the data for 0@xmath17 and 35@xmath17 . towards the magnetic transiton a shift of the resonance to higher fields",
    "is observed for all three directions , which is due to the decrease of the magnetization on approaching @xmath21 .",
    "in conclusion , we found that the anisotropy in the ferromagnetic ( 001)-plane can be interpreted as a superposition of a cubic fourfold symmetry and a twofold symmetry due to anisotropic ferromagnetic superexchange interactions like in lamno@xmath2 .",
    "the fourfold contribution is strongest just above the structural transition , where the system tends to restore cubic symmetry .",
    "the spin - reorientation is found to take place at 130 k far above the structural transition .",
