    "one of the canonical notions in the theory of thermal phase transition is the landau - ginzburg - wilson ( lgw ) symmetry - breaking paradigm . for a second order phase transition ,",
    "one utilizes a few `` order parameters '' to characterize different symmetries of the phases and thus a critical theory is in terms of fluctuations of these order parameters , which drive the system towards a critical point . in the past few years ,",
    "whether the lgw paradigm may be extended to quantum phase transitions has become one of the most fascinating topics in studies of strongly correlated electronic materials .",
    "in fact , there has been substantial investigations ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) showing that the conventional lgw paradigm fails to describe diverse quantum phase transitions .",
    "in particular , a microscopic mechanism that violates the lgw paradigm is the so - called `` fractionalization '' , discovered , say , in the study of two - dimensional quantum magnets @xcite . it suggests a very general scenario of quantum phase transitions that has been currently under intensive experimental and theoretical investigations .",
    "basically , a quantum particle may be effectively fractionalized into a few degrees of freedom interacting via emergent gauge field , and some fractionalized degrees of freedom appear at the critical point but _ not _ in the stable phases at each side of the critical point .    thus ,",
    "as correlated electronic systems are concerned , a fundamental issue is : how does the electron fractionalization , where electrons are effectively fractionalized into the spin and the charge degrees of freedom at short scales , lead to various phases and the phase transitions between them ? in one dimension , it has been well established that the spin - charge separation results in the tomonaga - luttinger liquid . in contrast , less has been known about the interplay between the electron fractionalization and quantum phase transitions , notably in the two - dimensional doped mott insulator @xcite which is widely accepted to be the prototype of high temperature superconductors @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding , experimental and theoretical analysis indicating the electron fractionalization to be at the root of low - dimensional strongly correlated electronic systems has been well documented .",
    "in fact , there exist two classes of experiments on cuprate materials , namely the large nernst effect in thermoelectric transport measurements @xcite and the periodic modulations of electronic density of states in scanning tunneling microscopy studies @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out @xcite that a lgw - type theory trying to reconcile these two phenomena can not be , at least , extended to zero temperature .",
    "instead , substantial theoretical analysis shows that the electron fractionalization necessarily leads to new quantum phases @xcite .",
    "this opinion has been reiterated very recently by zaanen and overbosch @xcite , who pointed out that the drastic change in the nature of quantum statistics upon doping  a direct manifestation of the electron fractionalization  may be the key to understanding physics of the pseudogap phase .",
    "central to these studies are a number of fundamental issues .",
    "the most prominent ones include : _ what kind of quantum statistics do the emergent degrees of freedom obey ? how do they interact with each other ?",
    "how does the electron fractionalization turn an antiferromagnet into a superconductor upon doping ?",
    "what does the phase diagram look like ?",
    "_    while to investigate these issues for general doped mott insulators proves to be highly challenging , in this work , we switch to a limiting case where the on - site coulomb repulsion is strong enough , namely the @xmath0-@xmath1 model ( on a bipartite lattice ) , and will present an analytical study of the above problems . our starting point is an exact non - perturbative result for this model , the so - called _ phase string effect _ discovered some time ago @xcite .",
    "specifically , the motion of a hole may leave a trace on the lattice plane upon colliding with spins .",
    "the phase string effect means that such two nearby propagating paths of the hole , though possessing ( almost ) identical amplitudes , may substantially differ in the phases by @xmath2 ( namely in the overall sign ) .",
    "such a sign structure accounts for the parity of the number of hole",
    " spin collisions and is thereby intrinsic to individual paths .",
    "most importantly , with this effect being taken into full account , it turns out ( to be detailed in this work ) that an electron is uniquely , _ rather than arbitrarily _ ,",
    "fractionalized into two bosonic constituents namely the holon and the spinon , satisfying a mutual statistical interaction . basing on this exact result , in this work",
    ", we will study  at a full microscopic level  how a phase diagram flows out of electron fractionalization .",
    "the main results of this work were briefly reported in our earlier publication @xcite .",
    "the present paper is devoted to reporting the technical details and the remaining is organized as follows . for the self - contained purposes we will briefly review the phase string effect in sec .  [ sec_phasestring ] and ,",
    "particularly , introduce the emergent mutual statistical interaction . in sec .",
    "[ sec_latticemcs ] , we will formulate a general lattice field theory basing on the phase string effect and introduce a pair of unconventional order parameters .",

    "[ sec_linearresponse ] .",
    "in particular , we will prove a composition rule that expresses the electric conductivity in terms of holon and spinon conductivities .",

    "the superexchange and hopping hamiltonian are written as @xcite @xmath23 note that the sign of @xmath15 is now negative . here",
    "the `` holon '' creation operator @xmath24 and the `` spinon '' annihilation operator @xmath25 commute with each other , and satisfy the no - double - occupancy constraint : @xmath26    the sign structure in @xmath14 ( arising from hole - spin exchange ) results in peculiar properties .",
    "technically , it prohibits a perturbative expansion of the resolvent : @xmath27 even in @xmath28 .",
    "physically , it accounts for the fact @xcite that the holon , upon hopping to some site occupied instantly by a @xmath29 ( @xmath30)-spin , acquires a sign @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "( as such , the marshall sign rule is incompatible with the hopping process . )",
    "therefore , two holon paths close to each other , though having ( almost ) identical amplitudes , may differ in the sign , because the parity of the number of hole@xmath30-spin collisions of each paths may be different .",
