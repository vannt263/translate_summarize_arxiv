    "the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe is a milestone for cosmology which has deep implications for the composition of the universe , structure formation and its fate .",
    "the expansion of the universe shows that it is not slowing down under normal gravity but accelerating due to an unknown component termed as dark energy ( de ) , having a strong negative pressure @xcite .",
    "there are many pieces of evidence for the existence of this component of the universe other than the baryonic and non - baryonic dark matter ( dm ) @xcite but it has no clear clue about its identity .    the most convenient explanation for this expansion is the vacuum energy that generates sufficient force to push matter apart described by cosmological constant @xcite . however , there are two alternative ways used extensively in order to explain this behavior .",
    "the first approach is the work on different de models such as quintessence @xcite , k - essence @xcite , phantom @xcite , quintom @xcite , tachyon @xcite , family of chaplygin gas @xcite , holographic @xcite and new agegraphic de @xcite . among all these models ,",
    "holographic de models are widely used .",
    "they provide the link of the de density to the cosmic horizon @xcite and has been tested through various astronomical observations @xcite .",
    "the idea of holographic de model ( hde ) can be extracted from the holographic principle , which states that _ the number of degrees of freedom of a physical system should scale with its bounding area rather than its volume _",
    "cohen et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a relation of ultraviolet ( uv ) @xmath2 and infrared ( ir ) cutoffs @xmath3 due to the limit set by forming a black hole in quantum field theory . in their point of view",
    ", the total energy of the system having size @xmath3 is bounded by the mass of black hole of the same size .",
    "mathematically , it can be written as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 represents the vacuum energy density and @xmath6 is the reduced planck mass .",
    "thus one can deduce holographic de @xcite @xmath7 here constant @xmath8 is used for convenience and @xmath9 .",
    "the variation of newton gravitational constant @xmath0 with cosmic time @xmath10 has been considered for discussing the evolution of de models .",
    "this was also used for solving the longstanding problems such as the dm problem , the controversies of hubble parameter value and the cosmic coincidence problem ( references therein @xcite ) . additionally , a lot of debate is available in literature for the choice of ir cutoff : whether it is a hubble horizon , or particle horizon , or future event horizon for flat frw universe .",
    "it was pointed out by li @xcite that the future event horizon is the appropriate choice for ir cutoff which favors the current observations .",
    "the modified and multidimensional theories of gravity ( including f(@xmath11 ) , f(@xmath0 ) , f(@xmath11,@xmath0 ) @xcite , f(@xmath12 ) @xcite , brans@xmath1dicke @xcite , horava@xmath1lifshitz @xcite , kaluza@xmath1 + klein ( kk ) @xcite ) is the second approach in which a phenomenon to modify the gravitational sector or increment of dimension takes place . in case of higher dimensional theories ,",
    "kk theory has attracted many people recently to discuss the de puzzle .",
    "it exists in two versions : compact ( fifth dimension is length like and it should be very small ) and non - compact forms ( fifth dimension is mass like ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , on the basis of the @xmath13 dimensional mass of the schwarzschild black hole @xcite , gong and li @xcite derived the hde in extra dimensions ( called modified holographic dark energy ( mhde ) ) .",
    "a marvellous work is available which investigates the non - interacting @xcite and interacting @xcite possibilities of hde with dm in flat and non - flat frw universes .",
    "the thermodynamical interpretation of hde model with different ir cutoff was also investigated by many people @xcite for non - flat frw universe .",

    "@xcite proved that these parameters are a useful tool for describing the properties of de models .",
    "some people @xcite-@xcite have obtained interesting results about hde with the help of these parameters .",

    "@xcite have explored the evolution of interacting mhde with hubble horizon and event horizon as an ir cutoff in a flat kk universe and also examined the validity of generalized second law of thermodynamics ( gslt ) .",

    "the equation of continuity for the kk universe is @xmath49 we consider the universe filled with de and dm which splits it into two equations for dm and de , respectively , as @xmath50 in order to eliminate the term including @xmath51 in eq.([10 ] ) , we use eqs.([2 ] ) , ( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 11 ] ) : @xmath52.\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] inserting this value in eq.([10 ] ) , it follows that @xmath53,\\\\\\nonumber { \\omega}'_{k}&=&{\\omega}_{k}\\left[2-{\\omega}_{\\lambda}(6-\\frac{2m\\pi } { h^{2}\\sqrt{2\\omega_{\\lambda}}}cosn(\\sqrt{|k|}\\delta ) ) + 2{\\omega}_{k}-\\delta_{g}(1+\\omega_{k}\\right.\\\\\\nonumber & -&\\left.\\omega_{\\lambda})\\right].\\\\\\label{14}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now we want to extract eos parameter @xmath54 in terms of redshift parameter @xmath55 .",
    "integration of the conservation equation for de gives @xmath56 we follow the procedure of li @xcite and use taylor expansion of the de density around the present time @xmath57 as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the present value of the de density .",
    "the eos parameter , up to second order expansion , becomes @xmath60 here we have assumed the small redshift approximation , i.e. , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 from ( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ 11 ] ) , one can get @xmath63 making use of eqs.([14 ] ) , ( [ 16 ] ) and ( [ 17 ] ) , it follows that @xmath64,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where ( @xmath65 ) denotes the present time value of the parameters .    finally , we obtain @xmath66 by inserting the above equations in ( [ 15 ] ) . in the evolution of @xmath66 ,",

    "thermodynamics of black hole plays the role of pillar for thermodynamical interpretation of the universe .",
    "bekenstein @xcite suggested that , in view of the proportionality relation between entropy of black hole horizon and horizon area , the sum of black hole entropy and the background entropy must be an increasing quantity with time .",
