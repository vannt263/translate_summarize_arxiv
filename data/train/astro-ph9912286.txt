    "this paper is directed towards the question ; have we already detected primeval galaxies ?",
    "the characteristics of a primeval galaxy might be    * high redshift ( @xmath4 ) * undergoing a major episode of star formation + ( to form @xmath5 in @xmath6 yrs , we need a star formation rate @xmath7 ) * high gas fraction , say @xmath8 * evidence of interactions , mergers , dynamical youth .",
    "first efforts to find such galaxies centred on spectroscopic searches for ly@xmath9-emitting galaxies ( see eg the review by djorgovski and thompson 1992 ) . while examples of such galaxies are now being found , these early surveys suggested that either star formation must be a more protracted process , occurring in smaller bursts ( as expected in many bottom - up scenarios ) , or that dust extinction must play a large role .",
    "steidel et al ( 1996 ) have shown that star - forming galaxies at z @xmath10 3 can be found through deep ground - based photometry in the u , g and r bands .",
    "the high redshift galaxies manifest themselves as u - band dropouts as the lyman limit absorption is redshifted into the u band . over 500 spectroscopically confirmed high redshift galaxies have now been found by this technique",
    "many have weak or non - existent lyman @xmath9 emission , which accounts for the lack of success of the spectroscopic surveys .",
    "the role of dust in these galaxies has been discussed by pettini et al ( 1997 , 1998a , b ) , meurer et al ( 1997 , 1998 ) , calzetti ( 1998 ) .",
    "pettini et al ( 1997 , 1998a , b ) , dickinson ( 1998 ) and steidel et al ( 1998 ) . even at redshift 3",
    "it appears that dust extinction may be appreciable .",
    "however star formation rates in these galaxies are not exceptional , typically 1 - 30 @xmath11 .    the first evidence for galaxies with very high rates of star formation came from infrared surveys .",
    "starburst galaxies had been first identified by weedman ( 1975 ) from their ultraviolet excesses and characteristic emission - line spectra .",
    "prior to the launch of iras , balloon and airborne measurements had demonstrated that @xmath12 for several starburst galaxies ( see review by sanders and mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "joseph et al ( 1984 ) proposed that interactions and mergers might play a role in triggering starbursts .",
    "one of the major discoveries of the iras mission was the existence of ultraluminous infrared galaxies , galaxies with @xmath13 .",
    "the peculiar seyfert 2 galaxy arp 220 was recognised as having an exceptional far infrared luminosity early in the mission ( soifer et al 1984 ) .",
    "the conversion from far infrared luminosity to star formation rate has been discussed by many authors ( eg scoville and young 1983 , thronson and telesco 1986 , rowan - robinson et al 1997 ) .",
    "rowan - robinson ( 1999 ) has given an updated estimate of how the star - formation rate can be derived from the far infrared luminosity , finding    @xmath14 $ ] = 2.2 @xmath15 x@xmath16    where @xmath17 takes account of the uncertainty in the imf (= 1 , for a standard salpeter function ) and @xmath18 is the fraction of uv light absorbed by dust , estimated to by 2@xmath193 for starburst galaxies ( calzetti 1998 ) .",
    "we see that the star - formation rates in ultraluminous galaxies are @xmath20 .",
    "however the time - scale of luminous starbursts may be in the range @xmath21 yrs ( goldader et al 1997 ) , so the total mass of stars formed in the episode may typically be only 10@xmath22 of the mass of a galaxy .    in this paper",
    "i discuss an even more extreme class of infrared galaxy , hyperluminous infrared galaxies , which i define to be those with rest - frame infrared ( 1 - 1000 @xmath1 m ) luminosities , @xmath23 , in excess of @xmath24 ( = @xmath25 ) . for a galaxy with an m82-like starburst spectrum",
    "this corresponds to @xmath26 , since the bolometric correction at 60 @xmath1 m is 1.63 .",
    "sanders and mirabel ( 1996 ) have a slightly more stringent criterion , @xmath27 , but in practice they use an estimate of @xmath28 based on iras fluxes , which results in a demarcation almost identical to that adopted here . while the emission at rest - frame wavelengths 3 - 30 @xmath1 m in these galaxies",
    "is often due to an agn dust torus ( see below ) , i argue that their emission at rest - frame wavelengths @xmath2 m is primarily due to extreme starbursts , implying star formation rates in excess of 1000 @xmath29 .",
    "these then are excellent candidates for being primeval galaxies , galaxies undergoing a very major episode of star formation .",
    "a preliminary version of these arguments was given by rowan - robinson ( 1996 ) .",
    "granato et al ( 1996 ) modelled the seds of 4 hyperluminous galaxies ( f10214 , h1413 , p09104 and f15307 ) in terms of an agn dust torus model .",
    "hughes et al ( 1997 ) argued that hyperluminous galaxies can not be thought of as primeval galaxies on the basis of their estimates of the gas mass and star formation rates in these galaxies .",
    "however i show below that their arguments are not compelling .",
    "fabian et al ( 1994 , 1998 ) argued from x - ray evidence that 09104 + 4109 and 15307 + 325 are obscured agn and this interpretation is supported for these objects by the non - detection of co and submm continuum radiation ( yun and scoville 1999 , evans et al 1999 ) .",
    "however the very severe upper limits on x - ray emission set by wilman et al ( 1999 ) for several hyperluminous infrared galaies led the latter to conclude that the objects might be powered by starbursts .",
    "mcmahon et al ( 1999 ) interpret the submillimetre emission from high redshift quasars and other hyperluminous infrared galaxies as powered , at least in part , by the agn rather than by star formation . on the other hand frayer",
    "et al ( 1999a , b ) favour a starburst interpretation for 14011 + 0252 and 02399 - 0136 .",
    "i discuss these arguments further below and try to resolve the question of what fraction of the far infrared luminosity is powered by a starburst or agn .",
    "the use of model spectral energy distributions derived from accurate radiative transfer codes is a significant advance on some previous work .",
    "i assume throughout that @xmath30 = 50 , @xmath31 = 1 . with lower @xmath31 , more galaxies , especially at higher redshifts , would satisfy the definition adopted .",
    "sanders et al ( 1988 ) discussed the properties of 10 iras ultraluminous galaxies with 60 @xmath1 m fluxes @xmath10 5 jy and concluded that ( a ) all were interacting , merging or had peculiar morphologies , ( b ) all had agn line spectra . on the other hand leech et al ( 1989 ) found that only 2 of their sample of 6 ultraluminous iras galaxies had an agn line spectrum .",
    "leech et al ( 1994 ) found that 67 @xmath22 of a much larger sample ( 42 ) of ultraluminous galaxies were interacting , merging or peculiar .",
    "lawrence et al 1989 had found a much lower fraction amongst galaxies of high but less extreme infrared luminosity .",
    "the incidence of interacting , merging or peculiar galaxies by ir luminosity is summarised in fig 1 of rowan - robinson ( 1991 ) : the proportion of galaxies which are peculiar , interacting or merging increases steadily from 10 - 20@xmath22 at low ir luminosities to @xmath32 for ultraluminous ir galaxies .",
    "the situation on point ( b ) remains controversial , though , since lawrence et al ( 1999 ) find only a fraction 21@xmath22 of 81 ultraluminous galaxies in the qdot sample to have agn spectra ( but on the basis only of low - resolution spectra ) .",
    "veilleux et al ( 1995 ) find for a smaller sample ( 21 galaxies ) that 33@xmath22 of ultraluminous galaxies are seyfert 1 or 2 , with an additional 29@xmath22 having liner spectra , which they also classify as agn .",
    "veilleux et al ( 1999a ) find that 24@xmath22 of 77 galaxies with @xmath33 are seyfert 1 or 2 , increasing to 49@xmath22 of 31 galaxies with @xmath34 ( for @xmath35 ) .",
    "veilleux et al ( 1999b ) find , from near - ir imaging studies , no evidence that liners should be considered to be agn .",
    "sanders ( 1999 ) reports that most nearby ultraluminous ir galaxies contain an agn at some level .",
    "rowan - robinson and crawford ( 1989 ) found that their standard starburst galaxy model gave an excellent fit to the far infrared spectrum of mk 231 , an archetypal ultraluminous ir galaxy .",
    "however their models for arp 220 appeared to require a much higher optical depth in dust than the typical starburst galaxy .",
    "condon et al ( 1991 ) showed that the radio properties of most ultraluminous ir galaxies were consistent with a starburst model and argued that many of these galaxies required an exceptionally high optical depth .",
    "this suggestion was confirmed by the detailed models of rowan - robinson and efstathiou ( 1993 ) for the far infrared spectra of the condon et al sample .",
    "quasars and seyfert galaxies , on the other hand , tend to show a characteristic mid infrared continuum , broadly flat in @xmath36 from @xmath37 m .",
    "this component was modelled by rowan - robinson and crawford ( 1989 ) as dust in the narrow - line region of the agn with a density distribution n(r ) @xmath9 @xmath38 .",
    "more realistic models of this component based on a toroidal geometry are given by pier and krolik ( 1992 ) , granato and danese ( 1994 ) , rowan - robinson ( 1995 ) , efstathiou and rowan - robinson ( 1995 ) .",
    "rowan - robinson ( 1995 ) suggested that most quasars contain both ( far ir ) starbursts and ( mid ir ) components due to ( toroidal ) dust in the narrow line region .",
    "rowan - robinson and crawford ( 1989 ) were able to fit the iras colours and spectral energy distributions of galaxies detected in all 4 iras bands with a mixture of 3 components , emission from interstellar dust ( cirrus ) , a starburst and an agn dust torus .",
    "recently xu et al ( 1998 ) have shown that the same 3-component approach can be used to fit the iso - sws spectra of a large sample of galaxies . to accomodate the condon et",
    "al ( 1991 ) and rowan - robinson and efstathiou ( 1993 ) evidence for higher optical depth starbursts , ferrigno et al ( 1999 ) have extended the rowan - robinson and crawford ( 1989 ) analysis to include a fourth component , an arp220-like , high optical depth starburst , for galaxies with log @xmath39 12 .",
    "efstathiou et al ( 1999 ) have given improved radiative transfer models for starbursts as a function of the age of the starburst , for a range of initial dust optical depths .",
    "sanders et al ( 1988 ) proposed , on the basis of spectroscopic arguments for a sample of 10 objects , that all ultraluminous infrared galaxies contain an agn and that the far infrared emission is powered by this .",
    "sanders et al ( 1989 ) proposed a specific model , in the context of a discussion of the infrared emission from pg quasars , that the far infrared emission comes from the outer parts of a warped disk surrounding the agn .",
    "this is a difficult hypothesis to disprove , because if an arbitrary density distribution of dust is allowed at large distances from the agn , then any far infrared spectral energy distribution could in fact be generated . in this paper",
    "i consider whether the agn dust torus model of rowan - robinson ( 1995 ) can be extended naturally to explain the far infrared and submilllimetre emission from hyperluminous infrared galaxies , but conclude that in many cases this does not give a satisfactory explanation .",
    "i also place considerable weight on whether molecular gas is detected in the objects via co lines .",
    "rigopoulou et al ( 1996 ) observed a sample of ultraluminous infrared galaxies from the iras 5 jy sample at submillimetre wavelengths , with the jcmt , and at x - ray wavelengths , with rosat .",
    "they found that most of the far infrared and submillimetre spectra were fitted well with the starburst model of rowan - robinson and efstathiou ( 1993 ) .",
    "the ratio of bolometric luminosities at 1 kev and 60 @xmath1 m lie in the range @xmath40 and are consistent with a starburst interpretation of the x - ray emission in almost all cases . even more conclusively ,",
    "lutz et al ( 1996 ) and genzel et al ( 1998 ) have used iso - sws spectroscopy to show that the majority of ultraluminous ir galaxies are powered by a starburst rather than an agn .",
    "in 1988 kleinmann et al identified p09104 + 4109 with a z = 0.44 galaxy , implying a total far infrared luminosity of 1.5x@xmath41 , a factor 3 higher than any other ultraluminous galaxy seen to that date . in 1991 , as part of a programme of systematic identification and spectroscopy of a sample of 3400 iras faint source survey ( fss ) sources , rowan - robinson et al discovered iras f10214 + 4724 , an iras galaxy with z = 2.286 and a far infrared luminosity of 3x@xmath42 .",
    "this object appeared to presage an entirely new class of infrared galaxies .",
    "the detection of a huge mass of co by brown and vandenbout ( 1991 ) , @xmath43 , confirmed by the detection of a wealth of molecular lines ( solomon et al 1992 ) , and of submillimetre emission at wavelengths 450 - 1250 @xmath1 m ( rowan - robinson et al 1991,1993 , downes et al 1992 ) , implying a huge mass of dust , @xmath44 confirmed that this was an exceptional object .",
    "early models suggested this might be a giant elliptical galaxy in the process of formation ( elbaz et al 92 ) . simultaneously with the growing evidence for an exceptional starburst in f10214 , the seyfert 2 nature of the emission line spectrum ( rowan - robinson et al 1991 , elston et al 1994a ) was supported by the evidence for very strong optical polarisation ( lawrence et al 93 , elston et al 94b ) .",
    "subsequently it has become clear that f10214 is a gravitationally lensed system ( graham and liu 1995 , broadhurst and lehar 1995 , serjeant et al 1995 , eisenhardt et al 1996 ) with a magnification of about 10 at far infrared wavelengths , but not much greater than that ( green and rowan - robinson 1996 ) .",
    "even when the magnification of 10 is allowed for , f10214 is still an exceptionally luminous far ir source .    in 1992",
    "barvainis et al successfully detected submillimetre emission from the z=2.546 clover - leaf gravitationally lensed qso , h1413 + 117 , which suggested that h1143 is of similar luminosity to f10214 . subsequently",
    "( barvainis et al 1995 ) they realized that the galaxy was an iras fsc source .    here",
    "i want to place emphasis on the hyperluminous galaxies detected as a result of unbiassed surveys at far infrared ( and submillimetre ) wavelengths .",
    "the program of follow - up of iras fss sources which led to the discovery of f10214 ( rowan - robinson et al 1991 , oliver et al 1996 ) has also resulted in the discovery of a further 6 galaxies or quasars with far ir luminosities @xmath45 ( mcmahon et al 99 ) .",
    "four galaxies from the pscz survey ( saunders et al 1996 ) of iras galaxies brighter than 0.6 jy at 60 @xmath1 m fall into the hyperluminous category ( a further two are blazars , 3c345 and 3c446 , and these are not considered further here ) , and a further example has been found by stanford et al ( 1999 ) in a survey based on a comparison of the iras fss with the vla first radio survey .",
    "two galaxies detected in submillimetre surveys at 850 @xmath1 m with scuba also fall into the hyperluminous category ( but one of these only because of the effect of gravitational lensing ) .",
    "cutri et al ( 1994 ) reported a search for iras fss galaxies with warm 25/60 @xmath1 m colours , which yielded the z = 0.93 seyfert 2 galaxy , f15307 + 3252 ( see also hines et al 1995 ) .",
    "wilman et al ( 1999 ) have reported a further 2 hyperluminous galaxies from a more recent search for warm galaxies by cutri et al ( 1999 , in preparation ) .",
    "dey and van breugel ( 1995 ) reported a comparison of the texas radio survey with the iras fss catalogue , which resulted in 5 galaxies with fir ir luminosities @xmath46 .",
    "however three of these are present only in the fss reject catalogue and have not been able to be confirmed as far infrared sources to date .",
    "the other two are discussed below .",
    "four pg quasars from the list of sanders et al ( 1989 ) ( two of which are part of the study of rowan - robinson ( 1995 ) ) , fall into the hyperluminous category .",
    "recently irwin et al ( 1999 ) have found a z = 3.91 quasar which is associated with with iras fss source f08279 + 5255 , the highest redshift iras object to date .    finally , inspired by the success in finding highly redshifted submillimetre continuum and molecular line emission in f10214 ,",
    "several groups have studied an ad hoc selection of very high redshift quasars and radio - galaxies , with several notable successes ( andreani et al 1993 , dunlop et al 1995 , isaak et al 1995 , mcmahon et al 1995b , ojik et al 1995 , ivison 1995 , omont et al 1997 , hughes et al 1997 , mcmahon et al 1999 ) .",
    "many of these detections imply far ir luminosities @xmath45 , assuming that the far ir spectra are typical starbursts . in",
    "all there are now 39 hyperluminous infrared galaxies known , which are listed in tables 1 - 3 according to whether they are ( 1 ) the result of unbiased 60 @xmath1 m ( or submm ) surveys , ( 2 ) found from comparison of known quasar and radio - galaxy lists with 60 @xmath1 m catalogues , ( 3 ) found through submillimetre observations of known high redshift agn .",
    "table 4 lists some luminous infrared galaxies which do not quite meet my criteria , but have far infrared luminosities @xmath47 . but to set these in perspective there are a further 20 pscz galaxies which have 13.00 @xmath48 13.22 ( for @xmath30 = 50 ) .    from the surveys summarised in table 1 we can estimate that the number of hyperluminous galaxies per sq deg brighter than 200 mjy at 60 @xmath1",
    "m is 0.0027 - 0.0043 , which would imply that there are 100 - 200 hyperluminous iras galaxies over the whole sky , 25 of which are listed in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "for a small number of these galaxies we have reasonably detailed continuum spectra from radio to uv wavelengths .",
    "figures 1 - 17 show the infrared continua of these hyperluminous galaxies , with fits using radiative transfer models ( specifically the standard m82-like starburst model and an arp220-like high optical depth starburst model from efstathiou et al ( 1999 ) and the standard agn dust torus model of rowan - robinson ( 1995 ) .",
    "more than half of those shown have measurements at at least 9 independent wavelengths    we now discuss the individual objects ( and a few not plotted ) in turn :    @xmath49    the continuum emission from f10214 was the subject of a detailed discussion by rowan - robinson et al ( 1993 ) .",

    "the clover - leaf lensed system h1413 + 117 has been found to have a magnification of 10 ( yun et al 1997 ) .",
    "downes et al ( 1998 ) report a magnification of 14 for f08279 + 5255 . also , ivison et al estimate a magnification of 2.5 for smmj02399 - 0136 and frayer et al ( 1999a ) quote a magnification of 2.75 @xmath740.25 for smmj14011 + 0252 .",
    "these magnifications have to be corrected for in estimating luminosities ( and dust and gas masses ) and these corrections are indicated in fig 18 .",
    "it appears to be a reasonable assumption that if a starburst luminosity in excess of @xmath75 is measured then the source is likely to be lensed , so f14218 and tx1011 merit further more careful study .    on the other hand",
    "there is strong evidence for a population of galaxies with far ir luminosities in the range 1 - 3x@xmath76 .",
    "i have argued that in most cases the rest - frame radiation longward of 50 @xmath1 m comes from a starburst component .",
    "the luminosities are such as to require star formation rates in the range 3 - 10x@xmath77yr , which would in turn generate most of the heavy elements in a @xmath5 galaxy in @xmath78 yrs .",
    "most of these galaxies can therefore be considered to be undergoing their most significant episode of star formation , ie to be in the process of ` formation ' .",
    "it appears to be significant that a large fraction of these objects are seyferts , radio - galaxies or qsos . for the galaxies in tables 2 and 3 , this is a selection effect in that these objects are deliberately selected to be , or to be biased towards , agn . for the population of objects found from direct optical follow - up of iras samples or 850 @xmath1 m surveys ( table 1 ) , out of 12 objects , 5 are qsos or seyfert 1 , 1 is seyfert 2 , and 6 are narrow - line objects .",
    "thus in at least 50 @xmath22 of cases , this phase of exceptionally high far ir luminosity is accompanied by agn activity at optical and uv wavelengths .",
    "this proportion might increase if high resolution spectroscopy were available for all the galaxies . for comparison",
    "the proportion of ultraluminous galaxies which contain agn has also been estimated as 49 @xmath22 ( veilleux et al 1999 ) .",
    "however despite the high proportion of ultraluminous and hyperluminous galaxies which contain agn , this does not prove that an agn is the source of the rest - frame far infrared radiation .",
    "the iso - lws mid - infrared spectroscopic programme of genzel et al ( 1998 ) , lutz et al ( 1998 ) , has shown that the far infrared radiation of most ultraluminous galaxies is powered by a starburst , despite the presence of an agn in many cases .",
    "wilman et al ( 1999 ) have shown that the x - ray emission from several hyperluminous galaxies is too weak for them to be powered by a typical agn .    in the sanders",
    "et al ( 1989 ) picture , the far infrared and submillimetre emission would simply come from the outer regions of a warped disk surrounding the agn .",
    "some weaknesses of this picture as an explanation of the far infrared emission from pg quasars have been highlighted by rowan - robinson ( 1995 ) .",
    "a picture in which both a strong starburst and the agn activity are triggered by the same interaction or merger event is far more likely to be capable of understanding all phenomena ( cf yamada 1994 , taniguchi et al 1999 ) .    where hyperluminous galaxies are detected at rest - frame wavelengths in the range 3 - 30 @xmath1 m ( and this can correspond to observed wavelengths up to 150 @xmath1 m ) , the infrared spectrum is often found to correspond well to emission from a dust torus surrounding an agn ( eg figs 1 , 6 - 10 , 12 ) .",
    "this emission often contributes a substantial fraction of the total infrared ( 1 - 1000 @xmath1 m ) bolometric luminosity .",
    "for the 12 ir - selected objects of table 1 , the luminosity in the dust torus component exceeds that in the starburst for 5 of the galaxies ( 42@xmath22 ) .",
    "the advocacy of this paper for luminous starbursts relate only to the rest - frame emission at wavelengths @xmath2 m .",
    "figure 19 shows the correlation between the luminosity in the starburst component , @xmath72 , and the agn dust torus component , @xmath65 , for hyperluminous infrared galaxies , pg quasars ( rowan - robinson 1995 ) , and iras galaxies detected in all 4 bands ( rowan - robinson and crawford 1989 ) ( this extends fig 8 of rowan - robinson 1995 ) .",
    "the range of the ratio between these quantities , with 0.1 @xmath79 10 , is similar over a very wide range of infrared luminosity ( 5 orders of magnitude ) , showing that the proposed separation into these two components for hyperluminous ir galaxies is not at all implausible .",
    "the radiative transfer models can be used to derive dust masses and hence , via an assumed gas - to - dust ratio , gas masses . for the m82-like starburst model used here the appropriate conversion",
    "is @xmath80 , in solar units ( green and rowan - robinson 1996 ) .",
    "these estimates have been converted into estimates of gas mass assuming @xmath81 = 300 ( tables 1 - 4 , col 9 , bracketed values ) .",
    "however these estimates will not assist in deciding the plausibility of the starburst models , because the radiative transfer models are automatically self - consistent models of massive star - forming molecular clouds .",
    "estimates derived from @xmath82 fits to the spectral energy distributions are even less physically illuminating .",
    "far more valuable are the cases where direct estimates of gas mass can be derived from molecular line ( generally co ) observations .",
    "where available , these estimates have been given in tables 1 - 4 , col 9 , taken from frayer et al 1999a ( and references therein ) , barvainis et al 1998 , evans et al ( 1999 ) , yun and scoville ( 1999 ) .",
    "figure 20 shows a comparison of the estimates of @xmath72 derived here with estimates of @xmath83 derived from co observations .",
    "also shown are results for ultraluminous ir galaxies ( solomon et al 1997 ) and for more typical iras galaxies ( sanders et al 1991 ) ( after rationalisation of some objects in common ) .",
    "the appropriate conversion factor from co luminosity to gas mass is a matter of some controversy . for luminous infrared galaxies , sanders et al ( 1991 )",
    "used a characteristic value for molecular clouds in our galaxy , 4.78 @xmath84 .",
    "solomon et al ( 1997 ) found that such a value led to gas mass estimates for ultraluminous infrared galaxies a factor of 3 or more in excess of the dynamical masses and concluded that a value of 1.4 @xmath84 was more appropriate for these galaxies .",
    "downes and solomon ( 1998 ) studied several ultraluminous infrared galaxies in detail in co 2 - 1 and 1 - 0 with the iram interferometer , deriving an even lower value of 0.8 @xmath84 on the basis of radiative transfer models for the co lines .",
    "however their gas masses are on average only 1/6th of the ( revised ) inferred dynamical masses . in their detailed model for arp 220 ,",
    "scoville et al ( 1997 ) found a conversion factor 0.45 times the galactic value , ie 2.15 @xmath84 . combining this with an estimated ratio for t(3 - 2)/t(1 - 0 ) of 0.6 , frayer et al ( 1999a ) justify a value of 4 @xmath84 for gas mass estimates of hyperluminous galaxies derived from co 3 - 2 observations .    in tables 1 - 4 and",
    "fig 19 , i have followed frayer et al ( 1999a ) in using a conversion factor of 4 @xmath84 for hyperluminous galaxies . for other galaxies in fig 19 with luminosities @xmath85 ,",
    "i have used a conversion factor of 2 @xmath84 ( in line with scoville et al 1997 , but a factor of 2 or so higher than advocated by downes and solomon 1998 ) ; for galaxies with luminosities @xmath86 , i have used the standard galactic value , 4.78 @xmath84 .",
    "the range of ratios of @xmath56 for hyperluminous galaxies is consistent with that derived for ultraluminous starbursts . for cases where we have estimates of gas mass both from co lines and from dust emission ,",
    "the agreement is remarkably good ( within a factor of 2 ) . there is a tendency for the time - scale for gas - consumption , assuming a star formation rate given by eqn ( 1 ) , to be shorter for the more luminous objects , in the range @xmath21 yrs ( alternatively this could indicate a higher value for the low - mass cutoff in the imf ) .",
    "the cases where a strong limit can be set on @xmath83 are also , generally , those where the seds do not support the presence of a starburst component . after correction for the effects of gravitational lensing ,",
    "gas masses ranging up to 1 - 3 x @xmath5 are seen in most hyperluminous galaxies , comparable with the total stellar mass of an @xmath87 galaxy ( @xmath88 ) . in fact 24/39 hyperluminous galaxies in tables 1 - 3 have gas masses estimated either from co or from dust emission @xmath89 ( after correction for effects of lensing , where known ) .",
    "hughes et al ( 1997 ) argue that a star - forming galaxy can not be considered primeval unless it contains a total gas mass of @xmath90 , but this seems to neglect the fact that 90 @xmath22 of the mass of galaxies resides in the dark ( probably non - baryonic ) halo .",
    "\\(1 ) about 50 @xmath22 of hyperluminous infrared galaxies selected in unbiassed infrared surveys have agn optical spectra .",
    "this is not in fact higher than the proportion seen in ultraluminous ir galaxies by vielleux et al ( 199a ) .",
    "for about half of the galaxies in this sample , the agn dust torus is the dominant contribution to the total ir ( 1 - 1000 @xmath1 m ) bolometric luminosity , while in half of cases a starburst seems to be the dominant contributor .",
    "\\(2 ) there is a need for both an agn dust torus and starburst components to understand most seds of hyperluminous ir galaxies ( 29/39 ) . measured gas masses support , in most cases , the starburst interpretation of rest - frame far - infrared and submm ( @xmath91m)emission .",
    "\\(3 ) there is a broad correlation between the luminosities of starburst and agn dust torus components ( fig 19 ) .",
    "this may imply that there is a physical link between the triggering of star formation and the feeding of a massive black hole .",
    "taniguchi et al ( 1999 ) have argued that during a merger giving rise to a luminous starburst , a pre - existing black hole of @xmath92 may grow into a large one @xmath93 and hence form a quasar .",
    "alternatively they suggest that a large black hole might be formed out of star clusters with compact remnants .",
    "\\(3 ) there is no evidence in most objects that an agn powers a significant fraction of radiation at rest - frame wavelengths @xmath94 50 @xmath1 m . for p09104 and pg1634 ,",
    "the non - detection of co emission is consistent with the absence of evidence in the sed for a starburst component . in f08279 ,",
    "the mass of co detected suggests a limit on the starburst luminosity which implies that the observed submm radiation may simply be the long - wavelength tail of its agn dust torus emission .",
    "f15307 poses a problem : the sed can be understood as radiation from both an agn dust torus and an arp-220 like starburst , but the upper limit on the molecular mass from the non - detection of co would then imply a very extreme ir - luminosity to gas - mass ratio .",
    "\\(4 ) after correction for the effects of lensing , star - formation rates in excess of 2000 @xmath11 are inferred in many of these galaxies ( for a salpeter imf ) .",
    "this would be sufficient to exhaust the observed reservoir of gas in @xmath95 yrs .",
    "these galaxies are undergoing extremely major episodes of star formation , but we can not yet establish whether this is their first major burst of star formation .                                                                                                                                                pettini m. , steidel c.c .",
