    "in order to reduce the electric leakage and to meet the challenge brought about by the reduced physical size of the future nano - electronics , it is being explored to replace the electron charge with the spin degree of freedom in the electronic transport .",
    "this is the ambitious goal of researchers in the field of spintronics .",
    "@xcite one of basic issues in this field is how to generate the polarized spin in devices . as an straightforward way",
    ", the spin injection from ferromagnetic layers may provide a possible solution to this problem if the interface mismatch problem can be avoided , but it is more desirable to generate spin polarization directly by electric means in devices because of its easy controllability and compatibility with the standard microelectronics technology .",
    "@xcite the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) in semiconductors , which relates the electron spin to its momentum , may provide a controllable way to realize such purpose . based on this idea",
    ", the phenomenon of current - induced spin polarization ( cisp ) has recently attracted extensive attentions of a lot of research groups .",

    "@xcite restricted by experimental conditions at that time , this prediction was ignored until the beginning of 1990 s . with the development of sample fabrication and characterization technology in low - dimensional semiconductor systems , it was realized that such phenomena could also exist in quantum wells and heterostructures with the structure or bulk inversion asymmetry .",
    "@xcite later , many interesting topics about cisp have been raised , such as the joint effect of the rashba and dresselhaus soc mechanism ,  @xcite vertex correction ,  edelstein , aronov , chaplik , inoue1 quantum correction  bleibaum1,bleibaum2 and resonant spin polarization .",
    "@xcite experimentally , cisp was first observed by silov _",
    "@xcite in two - dimensional hole gas ( 2dhg ) by using the polarized photoluminescence .",
    "@xcite when inputting an in - plane current into the 2dhg system , they observed a large optical polarization in photoluminescence spectra .",
    "@xcite later , kato _ et al _ demonstrated the existence of the cisp in strained nonmagnetic semiconductors ,  @xcite and sih _ et al _ detected the cisp in the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in ( 110 ) @xmath1 quantum well .",
    "@xcite the cisp was also found in @xmath2 epilayers even up to the room temperature .",
    "@xcite very recently , the converse effect of cisp has been clearly shown by yang _",
    "et al _ experimentally,@xcite and the spin photocurrent has also been observed .",

    "the hole state in the luttinger - kohn hamiltonian  @xcite is a spinor of four components . as",
    "each component is a combination of spin and orbit momentum , the spin of a hole spinor is not a conserved physical quantity .",

    "we emphasize here in this lowest heavy hole subspace , the spin operators are no longer represented by three pauli matrices , because the `` generalized spin '' we shall adopt is a hybridization of spin and orbit angular momentum . in deriving the effective hamiltonian from the luttinger - kohn hamiltonian by the perturbation and truncation procedure to higher orders",
    ", one must take care of the corresponding transformation for the spin operator in order to obtain the correct expression . in the following",
    ", we will use the terminology `` generalized spin '' , or the `` spin '' for short , to denote the total angular momentum in the spin - orbit coupled systems .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to investigate the cisp of 2dhg in a more rigorous way .",
    "namely , we will derive the @xmath0-cubic rashba model and the corresponding spin operators for holes , and on this basis we will present both analytical and numerical results for the cisp in 2dhg .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec",
    "ii the general formalism and the hamiltonian for the 2dhg with structural inversion asymmetry is given . in sec iii in the low doping regime , with the perturbation theory , the hamiltonian and spin operators in the lowest heavy hole subspace are derived , and applied to analytical calculation of the cisp in 2dhg . in sec iv",
    ", we will show the numerical calculations agree well with the analytical results at the low - doping regime ; while in the high doping regime the numerical results predict some new features of cisp .",
    "particularly , we predict a pronounced cisp peak when fermi energy lies little above the energy minimum of the lowest light hole ( lh1 ) subband .",

    "( [ kubo1 ] ) in the relaxation time approximation .",
    "we shall show that the analytical and numerical results are in good agreements with each other in the regime of low hole density .",
    "the general properties of @xmath56 will be critically determined by symmetry of the system .",
    "for the two - dimensional system we investigate , the index @xmath57(@xmath58 ) in eq .",
    "( [ spinsus1 ] ) is simply chosen to be @xmath24 or @xmath25 in the following . without the asymmetrical potential @xmath59 , the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) is invariant under the space inversion transformation @xmath60if the origin point of @xmath26-axis is set at the mid - plane of the quantum well . applying the space inversion transformation ( [ traninv ] ) to eq .",
    "( spinsus1 ) , we have @xmath61whereby @xmath62 .",
    "this implies that no cisp appears when the inversion symmetry exists in the system .",
    "so the asymmetrical potential @xmath59 is crucial for the cisp .    in the presence of an asymmetrical potential @xmath59 ,",
    "the hamiltonian ( ham1 ) is invariant versus the rotation along z - axis with @xmath63 in both the real space and the spin space , @xmath64with the above transformations ( [ tran1 ] ) , eq .

    "in the low hole density regime an effective hamiltonian can be obtained by projecting the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) into the subspace spanned by the lowest heavy hole states , which , by using the truncation approximation and projection perturbation method , @xcite is reduced to the widely used @xmath0-cubic rashba model .",
    "more importantly , the corresponding spin operators in the subspace will be obtained properly , and the ess of 2dhg with the impurity vertex correction will be worked out",
    ". then we will compare and contrast the different behaviors of the cisp in the 2deg and 2dhg in this section .      to obtain an approximate analytical expression , we take the following procedure .",
    "first we expand a hole state in terms of 8 basis wave functions associated with @xmath69 ( @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) ( eq .",

    "then for a given @xmath72 , we may express the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) in terms of an @xmath73 matrix , which by the perturbation procedure can be further projected into the subspace spanned by the @xmath74 and @xmath75 states .",
    "thus we obtain a @xmath76 matrix as ( see appendix a for details ) , @xmath77where the pauli matrix @xmath78 , the effective mass is renormalized into @xmath79and the @xmath0-cubic rashba coefficient @xmath80note that eq .",
    "( [ hamkr3 ] ) is just the @xmath0-cubic rashba model , in which the rashba coefficient @xmath81 is proportional to asymmetrical potential strength @xmath8 , in agreement with the results by winkler .",

    "the correct spin operators in the @xmath0-cubic rashba model , as described in appendix a , are expressed as @xmath93 in which @xmath94 l_{z}^{2}.   \\label{s1kr3}\\end{aligned}\\]]clearly , the coefficient @xmath95 and the rashba coefficient @xmath81 have the same dependence on @xmath8 and @xmath96 , thus we have @xmath97@xmath98 is related to @xmath99 , while @xmath100 consists of two parts : the diagonal part linear in @xmath101 and the non - diagonal part quadratic in @xmath102 .",
    "the diagonal part , which relates the wave vector @xmath103 ( @xmath104 with @xmath105 ( @xmath106 will give the main contribution to cisp .",

    ", so the integral over @xmath129 from @xmath131 to @xmath132 in eq.([vereqn1kr3 ] ) vanishes .",
    "furthermore , the higher order terms for the vertex correction vanish either , which is quite different from the vertex correction in the linear-@xmath72 rashba model .",
    "@xcite the same situation occurs for @xmath133 .",
    "the above results agree with the work by schliemann and loss .",
    "@xcite the calculation of the spin polarization is straightforward , and to the lowest order in fermi momentum @xmath134 and @xmath81 , only the term proportional to @xmath95 contributes to the spin polarization .",
    "the final result reads @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the hole density , @xmath137 is the fermi energy , and only the leading term in @xmath138 is retained .    in the relaxation time approximation",
    "the longitudinal conductivity of 2dhg equals to @xmath139thus , combining the expressions ( [ chiyxkr3 ] ) and ( [ conducxxkr3 ] ) , we have the ratio @xmath140 the formula above can be also obtained from the expression of the spin operator ( [ sy1 ] ) and the velocity operator ( [ vxkr3 ] ) by neglecting the non - diagonal part in the spin operator and the anomalous part in the velocity operator , i.e. @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "obviously , this ratio depends only on the material parameters , but not on the impurity scattering nor the carrier density in the low density limit .",
    "meanwhile , since both the current and spin polarization can be measured experimentally , the relation ( [ syjxkr3 ] ) may be invoked to obtain the @xmath0-cubic rashba coefficient @xmath57 experimentally .",
    "the cisp of 2dhg manifests itselve several features different from that of 2deg . to illustrate this , let s",
    "first take a look at the cisp of 2deg .",
    "the electric spin susceptibility is given by @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is the effective mass of electron and @xmath145 is the linear rashba coefficient . as shown by inoue _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite , the vertex correction due to the linear rashba spin splitting is non - trivial . with the longitudinal conductivity of 2deg @xmath146",
    ", we find the ratio of spin polarization to the current for the 2deg is @xmath147compared with ( [ syjxkr3 ] ) , we find the cisp of 2deg is inversely proportional to fermi energy .",
    "this means the ratio for 2deg decreases for heavier doping .",
    "this different fermi - energy dependence stems from the different types of spin orientation for 2deg and 2dhg .",
    "the spin orientation , which is the expectation value of spin operator @xmath148 for an eigenstate , is given by @xmath149for 2dhg , and @xmath150for 2deg .",
    "in the following , we take @xmath151 as short for the spin orientation above . eqs .",
    "( [ sxe ] ) and ( [ sye ] ) show that spin orientation for 2deg depends on the spin index @xmath152 , which has opposite values for the two spin - splitting states . but for 2dhg , the first term in eqs .",
    "( [ sx3 ] ) and ( [ sy3 ] ) is independent of the spin index @xmath153 .",
    "hence , when @xmath0 is small , this spin - index - independent term will dominate over the @xmath154-term , leading to the same spin orientation for the hole state with opposite @xmath152 .",
    "this is quite different from the electron case .",
    "an interesting question may be raised : why the holes with opposite @xmath87 have the same spin orientation ? in the following , we will analyze this problem and try to find the origin of this particular spin orientation for 2dhg .",
    "let s first have a look at the electron case .",
    "due to the spin - orbit coupling and inversion asymmetry , two - fold degeneracy of a subband is lifted . for a given @xmath0 ,",
    "we denote two spin - split states as @xmath155 and @xmath156 , where @xmath157 are the eigenstates of @xmath158 .",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath159 and @xmath160 have the opposite spin orientation , namely @xmath161 .",
    "similar to 2deg , two spin - split hole states in the subspace @xmath162 can be constructed as @xmath163 and @xmath164 . by eqs .",
    "( [ sx0 ] ) and ( [ sy0 ] ) , we can verify the matrix elements of @xmath165 and @xmath166 between @xmath167 and @xmath168 vanish , and @xmath169 .",
    "this indicates that in the subspace @xmath170 , any superposition of @xmath162 will not give rise to the spin orientation along the x- or y - direction .",
    "thus it is necessary to take the higher order perturbation into account , in particular the perturbation from coupling between @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "now we give the outline on the origin of the hole spin orientation by the perturbation procedure ( more systematic method can be found in appendix a ) .",
    "suppose the @xmath173 states @xmath174 can be expanded as @xmath175 where @xmath176 denotes the @xmath177th - order perturbed wave function . with the basis @xmath178 [ eq .",

    ", two types of terms can contribute to @xmath188 .",
    "the first type stems from the first - order perturbation by the @xmath189-operator in the luttinger hamiltonian [ eq .  ( [ hamlut ] ) ] , which couples @xmath190 ( @xmath191 ) to @xmath192 ( @xmath193 ) [ the second term in eq .  ( [ psi1 + ] ) or ( [ psi1- ] ) ]",
    "so the matrix element @xmath194 equals to @xmath195 it is obvious that the above formula is just the off - diagonal element in @xmath196 matrix [ eq .",
    "( [ sx1 ] ) ] with the first term in square bracket of @xmath197 [ eq .  ( [ s1kr3 ] ) ] retained .",
    "this gives the quadratic-@xmath0 dependence of the spin orientation shown as the second term in eq .",
    "( [ sx3 ] ) .",
    "the second type comes from joint action of the @xmath198 in in luttinger hamiltonian and the asymmetrical potential @xmath199 [ see eqs .",
    "( [ psi2 + ] ) and ( [ psi2- ] ) ] . the second - order perturbation contributes to @xmath200 with @xmath201 this term is just the diagonal element in eq .",
    "( [ sx1 ] ) , which leads to the first term in eq .",
    "( [ sx3 ] ) and is resposible for the identical spin orientation for two spin splitting hole states in small k regime .",
    "the spin splitting between @xmath202 depends on the coupling between @xmath203 and @xmath192 through higher - order perturbation .",
    "different from the electron case , the direct coupling will not cause the x - direction or y - direction spin orientation .",
    "instead , it results from the coupling between @xmath204 ( @xmath192 ) and @xmath191 ( @xmath205 ) . for two lh1 states , denoted as @xmath206 , such coupling will lead to the spin orientations of @xmath207 opposite to @xmath208 , and that of @xmath209 opposite to @xmath210 .",
    "thus the total spin orientation of the 2dhg is conserved , though @xmath208 and @xmath210 have the same spin orientation in the low hole density regime .",
    "based on the calculated eigenstates and eigenenergies of the total hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) , in this section we will work out the spin polarization by using the bastin version of kubo formula ( [ kubo1 ] ) in the relaxation time approximation .",
    "of course the validity of such approximation depends on the vanishing vertex correction as mentioned above .    our numerical results with an expanded basis set of @xmath211 basis functions (",
