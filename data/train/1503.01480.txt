    "relativistic jets are the most extreme expression of the power that can be generated by a superluminal black hole ( smbh ) in the center of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , with a large fraction of the power emitted in @xmath0-rays . before the launch of the _ fermi _ satellite only two classes of agn",
    "were known to generate these structures and thus to emit up to the @xmath0-ray band : blazars and radio galaxies , both hosted in giant elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "the first 4 years of observation by the large area telescope ( lat ) on board _ fermi _ confirmed that the extragalactic @xmath0-ray sky is dominated by radio - loud agn , being mostly blazars and some radio galaxies @xcite .",

    "they also exhibit strong x - ray variability , steep x - ray spectra , relatively high luminosity , and substantial soft x - ray excess ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these characteristics point to systems with smaller masses of the central black hole ( 10@xmath410@xmath5 m@xmath6 ) than blazars and radio galaxies , and higher accretion rates ( close to or above the eddington limit ) .",

    ". objects with high values of radio - loudness ( @xmath9 100 ) are even more sparse ( @xmath102.5% ) , while generally @xmath1015@xmath8 of quasars are radio - loud . considering also that nlsy1 are thought to be hosted in spiral galaxies , their detection in @xmath0-rays poses intriguing questions about the nature of these sources , the production of relativistic jets , the mechanisms of high - energy emission , and the cosmological evolution of radio - loud agn .",

    "the lack of detection at vhe could be due to different reasons : 1 ) the distance of the source ( @xmath31 = 0.5846 ) is relatively large and most of the gev / tev emission may be absorbed due to pair production from @xmath0-ray photons of the source and the infrared photons from the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) .",

    "2 ) the veritas observations were carried out a few days after the peak of the @xmath0-ray activity , thus covering only the last part of the mev / gev flare .",
    "3 ) considering the similarities with fsrq , a blr should be present in these nlsy1 .",
    "the presence of a blr could produce a spectral break due to pair production , suppressing the flux beyond a few gev and preventing a vhe detection .",
    "however , the detection at vhe of the fsrq 3c 279 , pks 1510@xmath13089 @xcite , and 4c @xmath1121.35 @xcite have shown that the spectrum of some fsrq extends to vhe energies during some flares , indicating that the @xmath0-rays may be produced outside the blr during those high - activity periods .",
    "the same scenario may apply to the @xmath0-ray emitting nlsy1 .",
    "the mechanism at work for producing a relativistic jet is not clear . in particular , the physical parameters that drive",
    "the jet formation is still under debate . by considering that nlsy1 are thought to be hosted in spiral galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) the presence of a relativistic jet in these sources seems to be in contrast to the paradigm that such structures could be produced only in elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the most powerful jets are found in luminous elliptical galaxies with very massive central bh and low accretion rates ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this was interpreted as an indirect evidence that a high spin is required for the jet production , since at least one major merger seems to be necessary to spin up the smbh . at the same time ,",
    "low accretion rates , which are associated with geometrically thick advection dominated accretion flows , may be important in jet formation by creating large - scale poloidal magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "therefore one of the most surprising facts related to the discovery of nlsy1 in @xmath0-rays is the development of a relativistic jet in objects with a relatively small bh mass of 10@xmath32 - 10@xmath33 m@xmath6 .",
    "however , it is worth noting that the mass estimation of the bh in these sources may have large uncertainties due to the effect of radiation pressure @xcite and the possible disc - like structure of their blr @xcite .",
    "@xcite modelling the optical / uv data of some radio - loud nlsy1 with a shakura & sunyaev disc spectrum have estimated higher bh masses than those reported in the past , for pmn j0948@xmath110022 and pks 1502@xmath11036 comparable to the values estimated for blazars .",
    "this may solve the problem of the minimum bh mass predicted in different scenarios of relativistic jet formation and development , but introduces a new problem .",
    "how is it possible to have such a large bh mass in a class of agn usually hosted in spiral galaxies",
    "? only very sparse observations of the host galaxy of radio - loud nlsy1 are available up to now . among the nlsy1 detected by lat only for the closest one , 1h 0323 + 342 ,",
    "the host galaxy was clearly detected , suggesting two possible scenarios : the spiral arms of the host galaxy @xcite or the residual of a galaxy merger @xcite .",
    "therefore the possibility that the production of relativistic jets in these objects could be due to strong merger activity , unusual in disc / spiral galaxies , can not be ruled out .",
    "the accretion rate ( thus the mass ) and the spin of the bh seem to be related to the host galaxy , leading to the hypothesis that relativistic jets can form only in elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "we noted that the bh masses of radio - loud nlsy1 are generally larger than those in the whole sample of nlsy1 ( m@xmath34 @xmath35(210)@xmath2110@xmath32 m@xmath6 ; @xcite ) , even if still small if compared to radio - loud quasars .",
    "the larger bh masses of radio - loud nlsy1 with respect to radio - quiet nlsy1 may be related to prolonged accretion episodes that can spin - up the bhs . in this context",
    ", the small fraction of radio - loud nlsy1 with respect to radio - loud quasars could be an indication that not in all the former the high - accretion regime lasted long enough to spin - up the central bh @xcite .",

    "<S> before the launch of the _ fermi _ satellite only two classes of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) were known to generate relativistic jets and thus to emit up to the @xmath0-ray energy range : blazars and radio galaxies , both hosted in giant elliptical galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the first four years of observations by the large area telescope ( lat ) on board _ fermi _ confirmed that these two populations represent the most numerous identified sources in the extragalactic @xmath0-ray sky , but the discovery of variable @xmath0-ray emission from 5 radio - loud narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nlsy1 ) galaxies revealed the presence of a possible emerging third class of agn with relativistic jets . considering that nlsy1 are thought to be hosted in spiral galaxies , this finding poses intriguing questions about the nature of these objects , the knowledge of the development of relativistic jets , and the evolution of radio - loud agn . in this context , the study of the radio - loud nlsy1 from radio to @xmath0-rays has received increasing attention . </S>",
    "<S> here we discuss the radio - to-@xmath0-rays properties of the @xmath0-ray emitting nlsy1 , also in comparison with the blazar scenario . </S>"
