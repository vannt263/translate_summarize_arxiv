    "gro  j174428 , an x - ray transient bursting pulsar , was discovered near the galactic center on 1995 dec .  2 with the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on board the compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) ( fishman _ et  al . _  1995",
    "; kouveliotou _ et  al . _",
    "1996 ) . using the batse data , finger _",
    "et  al . _  ( 1996 ) concluded that gro  j174428   is a low mass x - ray binary system including a neutron star with pulse frequency of 2.14  hz and a binary orbital period of 11.83 days ; the mass function of the system is 1.36 @xmath5 10@xmath6 m@xmath7 .",
    "et  al . _  ( 1996 ) estimated the magnetic field to be @xmath8 g. later , cui _",
    "et  al . _  ( 1997 ) analyzed observations with the proportional counter array ( pca ) on rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) and estimated the magnetic field strength to be @xmath9  g , assuming that the system was in the propeller state .",
    "et  al . _  ( 1996 ) discovered quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpo ) of the x - ray intensity at 20  hz , 40  hz and 60  hz in the pca data ; qpo features at 20  hz and 60  hz were weak , while the 40  hz qpo was quite prominent .",
    "major outbursts have been detected twice so far from gro  j174428 .",
    "the first outburst started in december 1995 , which lead to the discovery of the source .",
    "the burst activity was terminated in early may 1996 ( kouveliotou _ et  al . _",
    "the second outburst began about a year later in december 1996 ( kouveliotou _ et  al . _",
    "1997 ) and ended in april 1997 .",
    "both outbursts decayed with a time scale of a few tens of days .",
    "in addition to these major outbursts gro  j174428  seems to show small outbursts with shorter durations ( jahoda _ et  al . _",
    "1996 ) , detectable only below 50 kev .    since the discovery of gro  j174428 , several thousands of bursts have been observed . following some bursts",
    ", the flux decreases below the persistent level for a few seconds to a few minutes ( hereafter referred to as a dip ) , depending on the burst fluence ( swank _ et  al . _",
    "et  al . _  ( 1996 ) attributed these bursts to accretion instabilities ; similarly , lewin _",
    "et  al . _  ( 1996 ) remarked that these bursts were probably due to spasmodic release of gravitational potential energy ( type ii ) rather than thermonuclear burning ( type i ) , comparing the light curves measured by the rxte with those of the rapid buster .",
    "bildsten and brown ( 1997 ) , however , suggested that the bursts from gro  j174428  during its low persistent flux level could be due to the thermonuclear burning because the neutron star in gro  j174428   has only a weak magnetic field .",
    "a shift in the arrival time of the pulse during the bursts was observed by the oriented scintillation spectrometer experiment ( osse ; blanco _ et  al . _  1996 ,",
    "strickman _ et  al . _",
    "1996 ) and batse ( koshut _ et  al . _",
    "1998 ) on board the cgro and pca on board rxte ( stark _ et  al . _",
    "et  al . _  ( 1996 ) reported on the phase shift observed during the bursts , while stark _ et  al . _  ( 1996 ) reported on the pulse arrival time lag which persisted longer than the burst emission .",
    "_  ( 1998 ) reported on the energy and intensity dependence of the phase lag , or the lack thereof .    in spite of the stimulating results on the timing analysis summarized above , only limited spectral information has been reported so far ( swank _ et  al . _",
    "we therefore performed asca observations with a better spectral resolution than so far reported .",
    "this paper presents the results putting particular emphasis on the spectral features , and discusses the nature on this enigmatic x - ray object .",
    "preliminary analysis of a part of the asca observations has been reported by dotani _",
    "_  ( 1998 ) .",
    "the asca satellite carries two gas imaging spectrometers ( gis2 and gis3 ) and two solid state imaging spectrometers ( sis0 and sis1 ) at the foci of the nested thin foil mirrors ( tanaka _ et  al . _",
    "the gis covers a wider field of view ( 50 in diameter ) with high time resolution in the energy range of 0.710 kev ( ohashi _ et  al . _",
    "1996 , makishima _ et  al . _",
    "1996 ) , while the sis achieves high energy resolution ( 2  % at 6  kev ) , but the field of view is smaller ( 11 @xmath5 11 in 1ccd mode , burke _ et  al . _   1994 ) .",
    "these two types of detectors have complementary characteristics",
    ".    asca observations of gro  j174428   were made twice so far .",
    "the first was a too ( target of opportunity observation ) made on 1996 feb .",
    "2627 ( hereafter observation i ) , and the second observation was made on 1997 mar .",
    "16 ( observation ii ) .",
    "serendipitously , gro  j174428   was in the asca field of view while in outburst ( observation ii ) , as the primary target of the observation was the galactic center region .",
    "in addition , a sky region including gro  j174428  was observed in september 1995 , two months before the onset of the first outburst .",
    "however , the source was not detected ; a @xmath10 upper limit of the source flux is listed in table  1 .    in observation",
    "i , sis was operated in 1-ccd bright mode and gis in ph mode .",
    "the bit assignment of gis telemetry was changed to achieve higher time resolution ( 2  msec in high bit rate ) at the sacrifice of the rise time information of the detector signals .",
    "operation made of sis in observation ii was 4-ccd faint mode , and that of gis was ph mode with the same bit assignment as observation i. in observation ii , gro  j174428   was not the primary target , hence was located at the edge of the sis fields of view .",
    "this makes it very difficult to analyze the sis data of gro  j174428 .",
    "furthermore , the sis performance exhibited large degradation in 4-ccd mode due to the radiation damage .",
    "therefore , we analyzed only the gis data in observation ii .",
    "we screened the raw data using the following criteria .",
    "the criteria reject ( 1 ) data obtained at low elevation angles ( @xmath11 ) from the earth limb , ( 2 ) those affected by the south atlantic anomaly , ( 3 ) sis data obtained at low elevation angle ( @xmath12 ) from the day earth , and ( 4 ) data obtained at medium and low telemetry bit rate .",
    "the 4th criterion , which is usually not applied , was necessary because gro  j174428   was very bright during the observations .",
    "the count rate of the source largely exceeded the telemetry capacity in medium and low bit rate .",
    "hence , we used only the data in high bit rate , where the telemetry capacities of 128 cnts / sec / gis and 256 cnts / sec / sis were large enough to transfer all the event data of the persistent emission .",
    "although the data thus screened were enough for most of the subsequent analysis , sis data during the bursts could not be used in observation i , because the large increase of the count rate caused telemetry saturation .",
    "thus sis data were used only for the analysis of the persistent and dip emission in observation i. the journal of the observations is given in table 1 .",
    "the source photons ( event data ) were extracted from a @xmath13 radius region centered on the position of gro  j174428   for each detector .",
    "background data are accumulated from an annulus of @xmath14 radius centered on the source .",
    "figure 1 shows the gis images of gro  j174428  in observations i and ii , together with the regions of source and background extraction .",
    "since gro  j174428   was very bright during the asca observations , sis was heavily suffered by photon pile - up ( more than 2 photons fell in a pixel within a readout cycle ) near the image center , where the flux density is large . thus the sis source data in the inner region of a radius of 1.5  arcmin are excluded from the extraction radius of @xmath13 . to these data , we further corrected for the photon pile - up using the method described in ebisawa _",
    "_  ( 1996 ) , although the correction factor was found to be less than 1 % .",
    "the large flux of gro  j174428  also caused significant dead time on the on - board processing of gis source data ( event data ) . using the method described in makishima _",
    "_  ( 1996 ) , the dead time fractions are estimated to be @xmath15  % in observation i and @xmath16  % in observation ii in high bit rate .",
    "the monitor data provide further information in addition to the event data .",
    "the most important monitor data used in this paper are l1 data ( ohashi _ et  al . _   1996 ) ; it is the total number of x - ray event data ( 0.710 kev ) after on - board screening .",
    "the l1 data are essentially free from the telemetry limit and suffer from only very little dead time ( 25 @xmath17s ) .",
    "although the l1 data have no spatial resolution , this is not a problem for the gro  j174428  case , because the source was a single dominant x - ray source in the gis field of view ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "accordingly , the l1 data provide accurate flux of gro j1744 + 28 , hence can be used for the correction of the dead time on the event data .",
    "the minimum time resolution for the event data and l1 data are 2  msec and 125  msec , respectively , in high bit rate mode in both of the observations .",
    "further details of asca and its instrumentation can be found in tanaka _",
    "et  al . _  ( 1994 ) , burke _",
    "et  al . _  ( 1991 ) , serlemitsos _",
    "et  al . _  ( 1995 ) , ohashi _",
    "et  al . _  ( 1996 ) and makishima _",
    "_  ( 1996 ) .",
    "we first made the x - ray light curve using the l1 data of gis and they are given in figure  2 .",
    "after the correction for the vignetting , the persistent flux was found to be on average @xmath18 counts / sec and @xmath19 60 counts / sec for observations i and ii , respectively .",
    "we detected 12 bursts , 10 giant and 2 small bursts , during @xmath20  sec exposure in observation i , and 17 giant bursts during @xmath21  sec exposures in observation ii .",
    "thus the mean burst intervals ( for giant bursts ) are 27  min for observation i and 37  min for observation ii . although the flux level of the persistent emission differed by a factor of 3.3 between the two observations , the burst rate decreased only by a factor of @xmath22 .",
    "the so - called @xmath23 value , ratio of the average luminosity emitted in the persistent emission to that emitted in a burst ( average is taken over the time interval since the previous burst ) is roughly the same , @xmath24 for both observations .    in the light curve of observation",
    "i , we also found small bursts with a peak flux 10  % of the giant bursts .",
    "typical profiles of the giant and small bursts are plotted in figure  3 .",
    "we see clear intensity dip after both types of the bursts , whose duration depends on the burst fluence .",
    "we estimated the burst and dip total counts as follows .",
    "because the persistent flux level just before the burst was found to be constant , we could define the pre - burst flux level for each burst . then , the total burst / dip counts are calculated as the sum of deviation of the count rate from the pre - burst level .",
    "not all of the burst - dip pairs were fully observed until the flux level of the dip recovered to the persistent level , hence we were able to estimate the total counts of bursts and dips for 7 ( observation i ) and 8 ( observation ii ) burst - dip pairs .",
    "the correlation between the total counts of burst and dip is plotted in figure  4 for each burst - dip pair .",
    "we see that the ratios of the burst fluence to the flux deficiency in the following dip are about 1/2 and 1/4 for observations i and ii , respectively .      using the l1 light curve , pulse periods in the persistent phase of each observation",
    "were determined .",
    "the barycentric pulse periods ( corrected for the binary motion ) in the persistent phase are found to be 0.467059(2 ) sec and 0.4670469(8 ) sec , respectively , for observations i and ii .",
    "the value in the parenthesis represents error in the last digit of the pulse period .",
    "the pulse profile in the persistent phases is sinusoidal , with systematically larger pulse fraction in observation i than that of observation ii : @xmath25  % and @xmath26  % in the 0.710  kev band for observations i and ii , respectively .    during the dip and burst phases ,",
    "the pulse profiles have essentially the same shape ( sinusoidal ) as those of the persistent phase .",
    "pulse amplitude sometimes become very large ( a few tens % ) during the bursts , although the average amplitude is only slightly larger than that of the persistent phase .",
    "an example of the large pulse amplitude during bursts is shown in figure  5 .    next , we investigated the energy dependence of the pulse profile using the x - ray event data in observation i. although the event data suffered from a significant dead time , we did not apply the dead time correction to the raw event data , because the time resolution of the l1 data , which is necessary for the dead time correction , is not good enough ( 125 msec ) compared with the pulse period of 467 msec .",
    "the pulse profiles are given in figure 6 ( upper panels ) for three energy bands .",
    "the pulse profile are almost sinusoidal at every energy bands .",
    "the pulse profile of observation i is fitted with a sinusoidal function plus a constant , and pulse fractions defined as the ratio of the pulse amplitude to the non - pulsed component are calculated and are given in figure 7 with cross symbols . to the pulse fractions , we estimated the dead time effect using the method given in appendix .",
    "the solid line in figure 7 is the dead time corrected pulse fraction .",
    "we see that the large difference of the pulse fraction between higher and lower energy bands in the raw event data ( crosses ) is mainly due to the dead time effect and that the difference of the pulse fraction is much reduced after the dead time correction ( solid line ) .",
    "the pulse fraction in observation ii , where the dead time is negligibly small , shows the same dependence on the energy band as observation i , as is seen in the lower panel of figure 6 .",
    "the spectral analysis of gro  j174428  are performed separately for the persistent , dip and burst emissions . as explained in section 2 ,",
    "both sets of sis and gis data are used for observation i ( except for the bursts , for which only the gis data are used ) , but only gis data are used for observation ii . for each gis spectrum dead time was corrected according to the method given in makishima _",
    "et  al . _  ( 1996 ) .",
    "we also corrected for the gis gain shift , because the gis gain is known to increases slightly under the high count rate ( makishima _ et  al . _",
    "the gain correction factors we adopted for the burst and persistent / dip phases , were 0.6  % and 0.2  % for observation i and ii , respectively .",
    "note that the persistent emission is not subtracted from the burst energy spectra .",
    "we found that the energy spectra between observations i and ii are very similar for the persistent , burst , and dip phases .",
    "therefore , we first try to reproduce the energy spectra of the persistent emission , which have the best statistics , and then applied the same model to the energy spectra of the burst and dip phases . among the simple models ( such as a power law , a thermal bremsstrahlung , and a blackbody ) ,",
    "a power law ( @xmath27 ) modified by the cold matter absorption could reproduce the overall shape of the energy spectra relatively well .",
    "however , the model is rejected because of the large residual structure around 67 kev as shown in the middle panel of figure 8 . as a working hypothesis",
    ", we assume that it corresponds to an iron emission line and we added a model of a gaussian line to the power law continuum . as shown in the lower panel of figure 8 , the residual structure at 67 kev is greatly reduced .    from table 2 ,",
    "we see that model parameters obtained from different sensors are not consistent with each other ; the parameters of all the 4 sensors show systematic difference which is larger than the statistical errors .",
    "differences of the best - fit parameters are significant not only between gis and sis , but also among the same sensors",
    ". this may be partly due to a problem of the gain uncertainty of the sensor , because the discrepancy between the data and the model is especially large at the energies where the detection efficiency changes rapidly ( eg",
    ".  energies at gold m - edge , silicon k - edge , xenon l - edge ) .",
    "however , the discrepancy at these energies can not be removed by simply adjusting the gain .",
    "therefore the systematic errors is attributed not only to a possible gain uncertainty , but also to other calibration errors of the sensors .",
    "because gro  j174428  is a highly absorbed source having a significant flux only in the higher energy part of the asca band , calibration errors of the sensors could be larger than usual .",
    "since we have no data to estimate the calibration errors quantatively , we regard that the parameter differences among the sensors are the practical range of the systematic errors .",
    "we also fit the energy spectra of the burst and the dip phases with the same model ; results are summarized in table 2 .",
    "because the values of photon index and @xmath28 couple together , we investigate the confidence contour between these two values and find that there is a tendency that energy spectrum becomes slightly hard during the bursts and slightly soft during the dips in observation i. although such tendency is not clear in observation ii , it may be due to poorer statistics of the data .",
    "if we compare observations i and ii , the photon index of observation i seems to be systematically larger than that of observation ii .",
    "we found that the 6 - 7 kev structure is relatively well reproduced by a phenomenological model of a broad gaussian line with the center energy of at iron k - shell transition ; the structure is consistent with a broad line ( @xmath29 ev ) centered at 6.66.8 kev . in this subsection",
    ", we further apply a more physical model",
    ". the large line width can not be due to the thermal broadening , because the corresponding temperature would exceed 1 mev , but most probably reflects the bulk motion of the line emitting gas .",
    "if the mass accretion occurs via an accretion disk , the line width may arise from the doppler broadening due to the kepler motion of the accreting matter . to check this possibility",
    ", we try to fit the iron feature using the so - called disk line model ( the model `` diskline '' in xspec ) . in the fit",
    ", we fixed the outer disk radius , which is hardly constrained by the data , to 1000 @xmath30 ( @xmath30 : gravitational radius , gm / c@xmath31 ) . the results are summarized in table 3 .    the disk line model is found to reproduce the iron structure well .",
    "the ratio of the observed energy spectra to the best - fit model function is plotted in figure 9 .",
    "the line energy ranged over 6.26.6 kev in observation i. therefore , we conclude that the iron should be in a low ionization state , although the large systematic errors do not exclude a possibility of he - like iron .",
    "the inner radius of the accretion disk locates around @xmath32 , i.e.  @xmath33 cm , and the inclination angle of the accretion disk is @xmath34 degree . in observation",
    "ii , we could not constrain the disk inclination . if we fixed it to @xmath35 ,",
    "a high line energy , 6.77.0 kev , seems to be preferred .",
    "however , if the inclination is larger , lower line energy is still accepted .    with the preliminary analysis , dotani _",
    "et  al . _  ( 1998 ) reported that the broad emission line structure was reproduced by a partial covering model .",
    "thus we investigate this model using the more elaborated spectra .",
    "the results of the fitting are summarized in table 3 and the ratio to the best - fit model is shown in figure  10 . from the shape of the residual structures in figure  10 , the profile of the partial covering model seems not to match the observed shape of the iron structure very well .",
    "residual structures are prominent around 7  kev .",
    "the fits are also generally not very good ( red-@xmath36 of 23 is obtained in observation i ) .",
    "thus we conclude that the partial covering model is not preferred over the disk line model .",
    "we found that n@xmath37 values are constant at @xmath3 h  @xmath4 regardless of the large luminosity changes between observations i and ii . this value is slightly larger than the one reported by giles _",
    "et  al . _  ( 1996 ) with the rxte pca data ; their analysis , however , was preliminary .",
    "the stable n@xmath37 implies that the column density can be attributed to the interstellar absorption .",
    "et  al . _  ( 1997 ) obtained n@xmath37 values from many x - ray sources near the galactic center direction and found that most of them show systematic dependence on the galactic latitude , which supports that they really lie near the galactic center .",
    "the n@xmath37 value of gro  j174428   determined by the present work , lies at the edge of the above column density distribution , hence we conclude that gro  j174428   is really located near the galactic center at 8.5  kpc distance .",
    "x - ray pulsations of gro  j174428  are found to be very different from that of typical binary pulsars . the pulse amplitude is small , 68 % in 210 kev range , and has almost perfect sinusoidal profile .",
    "the pulse profile of binary pulsars is usually energy dependent and sometimes has complex features in a lower energy band .",
    "such energy dependence is not recognized in gro  j174428 , except for the increase of pulse fraction toward higher energies .",
    "the differences in the characteristics of the x - ray pulsation of gro  j174428  may result from the different parameters of the system , e.g.   mass accretion rate , accretion geometry , parameters of the neutron star , etc .   from typical binary pulsars .",
    "x - ray pulsation is produced by the beamed x - ray radiation from the polar cap regions of the neutron star , onto which the accreting matter is channeled by the strong magnetic field .",
    "the sinusoidal pulse profile of gro  j174428  indicates that either the emitting regions near the polar caps are large , or the system is low inclination , as argued by finger _",
    "et  al . _  ( 1996 ) , both of which will produce only weakly beamed radiation .",
    "small amplitude of the pulsation is also expected from a weakly beamed radiation .",
    "it is considered that the size of the polar cap emission reflect the size of the alfvn radius .",
    "accreting matter , either in a disk or in wind , is frozen in the magnetic field at the alfvn radius and drifts inward along the magnetic fields lines .",
    "if we assume dipole magnetic field , smaller alfvn radius makes a larger polar cap emission .",
    "this means that the surface magnetic field of gro  j174428  may be smaller than that of typical binary pulsars .",
    "the large mass accretion rate of gro  j174428  also makes the alfvn radius smaller .",
    "several estimates of the magnetic field of gro  j174428  in fact prefer a smaller value .",
    "_  ( 1996 ) estimated the magnetic field to be @xmath38 g from the assumption that the alfvn radius is smaller than the co - rotation radius when the pulsar spins up and shows pulsation .",
    "bildsten and brown ( 1997 ) obtained a tighter constraint of @xmath39 g from the same assumption , using a different set of data .",
    "cui ( 1997 ) observed evidence of the propeller effect when the source flux decreased and estimated the magnetic field to be @xmath40 g. stark _",
    "et  al . _  ( 1998 ) used the same data and obtained @xmath41 g , assuming the presence of a contaminating source nearly at the position of gro j1744 - 28 .",
    "all these estimates favor a weak magnetic field .",
    "we found that the pulse fraction increases with energy , which indicates that the energy spectrum of the pulsed component is harder that of the non - pulsed component , and that the pulsed emission comes from a different region from that of the non - pulsed component .",
    "since the pulsed emission is most likely from the polar caps of the neutron star , the non - pulsed emission may be attributed to a larger emission region , e.g.  whole neutron star surface .",
    "presence of the two emission region indicates the presence of two accretion paths as indicated in cui _",
    "et  al . _  ( 1997 ) .",
    "some part of the accreting matter may not follow the magnetic field and accrete spherically on to the neutron star .",
    "this may be related to the weak magnetic field .",
    "presence of two accreting paths is also suspected in the other type ii burster , the rapid burster , based on the observations of quasi - periodic oscillations ( dotani _ et  al . _",
    "two accretion paths may , therefore , be common to the neutron star which produces type ii bursts .",
    "we found that the pulse fraction during the bursts can be very large compared to that in the persistent emission .",
    "the light curve of individual burst indicates a pulse fraction occasionally as large as 50 % . on the other hand ,",
    "the pulse fraction during the dips is almost the same as that in the persistent emission .",
    "the small pulse fraction in the persistent emission means that most of the matter accretes spherically on to the neutron star and only a small fraction of matter is channeled to the polar caps .",
    "the large pulse amplitude during the bursts means that some excess mass tends to accrete to the polar caps and may indicate the location of the reservoir responsible for the bursts .",
    "we find that the burst fluence and the integrated flux deficiency in the subsequent dip show a good correlation .",
    "the burst fluence was approximately 1/2(observation i ) ",
    "1/4(observation ii ) of the flux deficiency .",
    "we interpret this correlation that the burst luminosity is compensated by the following dip luminosity , and the long - term energy release rate , or accretion rate is in fact nearly constant .",
    "therefore the burst activity may not be due to a global increase of the mass supply from the companion , but due to a sudden increase of the infall matter which has been accumulated in a reservoir near the neutron star .",
    "after a burst , a fraction of the accreting matter is accumulated into the reservoir , hence creating the flux dip phenomena .",
    "the fact that the burst fluence and the flux deficiency differ by a factor of 2 ( observation i ) 4 ( observation ii ) suggest a possibility that the x - ray radiation from gro  j174428  is un - isotropic , and the un - isotropy may change from observations i and ii , as well as from the persistent to the bursts .",
    "this possibility is also discussed in the next subsection , in the context of super eddington luminosity .",
    "the @xmath23-value is found to be @xmath19100 in both observations i and ii in spite of a factor 34 changes in the mass accretion rate .",
    "this constancy is retained by the proportionality of the luminosity of individual burst to the persistent luminosity , rather than the duty ratio ( burst interval ) of the burst as indicated in jahoda _",
    "_  ( 1998 ) .",
    "soon after the discovery of gro  j174428 , it was noticed that its x - ray luminosity can largely exceed the eddington limit of a neutron star ( giles _ et  al . _  1996 ;",
    "jahoda _ et  al . _",
    "the luminosity estimate of course depend on the source distance and might be reduced if gro  j174428  were much closer .",
    "however , we have shown that the source column density , @xmath42 @xmath4 , is fully consistent to the location near the galactic center when compared to the previous asca results ( sakano _ et  al . _",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the super eddington luminosity is , therefore , also confirmed by the asca observations . during observation",
    "i , the luminosity ( 210  kev ) of the persistent emission was @xmath43 erg s@xmath44 , which is comparable to the eddington limit of a neutron star . because the burst peak flux was more than 10 times the persistent flux , the x - ray emission of gro  j174428  during the bursts by far exceeds the eddington luminosity . in the early phase of the outburst , the x - ray flux was 10 times larger than that of observation i , hence exceeds the eddington luminosity by two orders of magnitude during the bursts as already noted by many authors .    since the super eddington luminosity is unlikely in rather long duration of the burst peak , as well as the persistent flux in the early time of the outburst , one may argue that the apparent super eddington luminosity by two orders of magnitude can be explained by highly un - isotropic radiation from gro  j174428 .",
    "however as we already suggested , most of the emission is non - pulsed component , and is likely come from the whole neutron star surface , hence highly un - isotropic radiation is unlikely , although small un - isotropy would be possible ( see section 4.3 ) .",
    "thus we argue that the eddington luminosity can not simply be explained by un - isotropic radiation , hence would remain to be an important issue for further study .",
    "we find a significant iron feature in the energy spectra of gro  j174428  in both observations i and ii . although it is known that the diffuse galactic ridge emission contains an iron emission line , contamination to the energy spectra of gro  j174428  is considered to be negligible .",
    "the fe - line intensity of the ridge emission at the location of gro  j174428   is @xmath45 photons / sec/@xmath1/sr ( maeda 1998 ) .",
    "this produces the contamination of @xmath46 photons / sec/@xmath1 during the observations of gro  j174428 .",
    "because the line flux of gro  j174428  was @xmath47 photons / sec/@xmath1 and @xmath48 photons / sec/@xmath1 for observations i and ii , respectively , contamination from the ridge emission is at least two orders of magnitude smaller and is completely negligible .    when fitted with a gaussian line model , the structure in observation i is consistent with a broad line ( @xmath29 ev ) centered at 6.66.8 kev .",
    "the equivalent widths are approximately 200400 ev .",
    "a disk line model also represents relatively well the iron structure .    a problem on the disk line model , however , is that the best - fit parameters in observation i , especially the inner disk radius , @xmath33 cm , and the disk inclination , @xmath49 , do not seem to fit the gro  j174428  system parameters . magnetic field strength of 2@xmath510@xmath50 g and x - ray luminosity of @xmath19 10@xmath51 erg / s indicate an alfvn radius of @xmath19 5 @xmath5 10@xmath52 cm , which is an order of magnitude larger than the above estimate .",
    "furthermore , we find that the inclination of the accretion disk is much larger than the previously estimated one ( finger _ et  al . _  1996 ) .",
    "sturner and dermer ( 1996 ) discussed the possible nature of the companion star and estimated the orbital inclination to be @xmath53 .",
    "rappaport and joss ( 1997 ) conducted a series of binary evolution simulations to constrain the orbital inclination between @xmath54 .",
    "these estimates are much smaller than the present results .",
    "if we force larger inner disk radius and lower inclination angle to the diskline model , the model line profile becomes much sharper than the observed profile and does not fit the data .",
    "therefore we are forced to consider additional broadening mechanism on the conventional disk line model .",
    "are the iron line photons compton scattered by a surrounding high temperature plasma ?",
    "does the accretion disk exist inner region than the alfven radius , which is estimated from a spherical mass accretion ? at this moment we have not enough data to judge what mechanism is really working , hence this issue is open for future study .",
    "we find that the energy dependence of the pulse amplitude shows a local minimum at 67  kev .",
    "this local minimum may be related to the iron structure of the energy spectrum .",
    "if we assume that the iron structure is due to the broad emission line and the line shows no pulsation , a local minimum in the pulse amplitude is expected just as observed in figure  7 . using the equivalent width of the line , 200  ev , we estimate the contribution of the line flux to the total flux at 67  kev bin ( bin width is 1  kev ) to be roughly 20  % .",
    "thus the fractional pulse amplitude may decrease by 20  % in 67 kev .",
    "in fact , the observed amplitude was 6  % in 67  kev , whereas the interpolated amplitude is 8  % .",
    "thus the decrease of the pulse amplitude in 67  kev may be due to the presence of the iron line which is not pulsated .",
    "we summarize the results obtained from the asca observations of gro  j174428  as follows :    1 .   we detected 10 and 17 giant type ii bursts during observation i and ii , with mean burst intervals of about 27 min and 37 min , respectively .",
    "the burst fluence is found to have good correlation with the total flux deficiency in the following dip .",
    "this correlation is interpreted that the average mass accretion rate is constant , but accretion instability makes the bursts and dips .",
    "the burst intervals do not change very much in spite of a factor of 4 decrease in x - ray luminosity between observation i and ii .",
    "thus the burst fluence also decreases in accordance with the persistent flux .",
    "the absorption column is found to be constant at @xmath55 h  @xmath4 regardless of the observation date and the source status ( persistent , burst and dip ) .",
    "this strongly indicates that the column density corresponds to the interstellar absorption , and the source is actually located near the galactic center , at a distance of 8.5  kpc .",
    "3 .   the persistent x - ray luminosity in the first and the second observations are @xmath56 erg s@xmath44 and @xmath57 erg s@xmath44 , respectively .",
    "the burst peak fluxes at the first observation exceed the eddington limit of a neutron star by a factor of 10 , if the radiation is spherically symmetric .",
    "the energy spectra of gro  j174428  are represented approximately by an absorbed power law with a broad line at @xmath196.7 kev .",
    "the shape of the spectra are almost the same for the different observation dates and types ( burst , dip and persistent emission ) . however , the spectra is slightly harder in observation ii ( @xmath27 ) than in observation i ( @xmath58 ) , and is harder during bursts than in persistent phase in each set of observations .",
    "the energy spectrum of the pulsed component is harder than that of the non - pulsed component .",
    "we consider that the different spectral hardness indicates different emission regions , e.g.  pulsed component from the polar caps and non - pulsed component from the whole neutron star surface .",
    "the presence of the iron feature is clearly seen in all energy spectra and is also indicated by the decrease of pulse fraction at 67 kev .",
    "the feature is well reproduced by a disk line model .",
    "however , some line broadening mechanism is needed to make the disk line parameters consistent to the system parameters of gro  j174428 .",
    "we express our thanks to all the asca team members for many efforts of the fabrication of the satellite , launching , daily operation , soft ware developments and calibrations .",
    "m.n . and y.m .",
    "are financially supported by the japan society for the promotion of science .",
    "dead time of asca gis is energy independent , hence does not change the shape of energy spectrum , only decreases the normalization factor .",
    "therefore the dead time effects can simply be corrected by the l1 counts . however , if the flux is time variable , the dead time effects on the time variable component become energy dependent due to a `` cross - talk '' between different energy bands .",
    "this appendix investigated the effect on the pulse fraction with different energy bands .",
    "makishima _ et  al .",
    "_  ( 1996 ) reported that gis has three kinds of dead time ; dead time caused by the hard - wired electronics , that due to the on - board cpu processing , and that due to a limitation in the telemetry capacity .",
    "these dead times depend on the gis mode and telemetry bit rate . in the case of ph mode with high bit rate , the same mode as the analysis of present paper , on - board cpu processing time is the dominant source of the dead time .",
    "therefore , in this appendix , we consider only the cpu - induced dead time ; the dead time fraction , @xmath59 , can be expressed as @xmath60 with @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the average cpu time per event ( @xmath63 msec ; makishima et al .",
    "1996 ) , and @xmath64 is the incident photon flux in the total energy band .",
    "when the incident flux exceeds a few tens photons per second , dead time effects of gis become significant .",
    "we consider a simple case that the time variation ( pulsation ) of the incident photon flux @xmath65 is represented by a sinusoidal form : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a constant flux and @xmath68 is the amplitude of sinusoidal variation . since any time variations of x - ray flux can be expressed by fourier series , results obtained in this appendix can be applied to general x - ray variabilities",
    ".    since the dead time fraction of gis does not depend on energy , detected ( dead time included ) count rate @xmath69 at energy @xmath70 is given as : @xmath71 then the time - averaged count rate is calculated as @xmath72 where @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) is the period of sinusoidal variation .",
    "note that time variation of @xmath69 is no more sinusoidal , because the dead time fraction , which corresponds to the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : append2 ] ) , is flux dependent ; in other words the dead time fraction varies from the pulse peak to valley .      to demonstrate how @xmath75 changes with the incident flux , we show the results of numerical calculation for three cases .",
    "we assume a power law energy spectrum , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , and rms fractional variation in the total band is 0.1 .",
    "photon index of the constant ( non - pulsed ) component is fixed to @xmath82 , but three different indices are assumed for the time variable ( pulsed ) component : @xmath83 ( case 1 ) , @xmath84 ( case 2 ) and @xmath85 ( case 3 ) . for simplicity , we divide two energy bands : 15 kev and 510 kev .",
    "the results are shown in figure 11 .",
    "ratio of the rms amplitudes ( i.e.  hardness ratio of the amplitude of the pulsed component ) are also plotted in the figure .",
    "as seen from the figure , rms fractional variations generally decrease with the increase of the incident flux .",
    "when the constant and the pulsed components have the same spectral shape ( center panels of figure 11 ) , reduction of the amplitude is exactly same between the two energy bands . thus the dead time",
    "does not alter the hardness of the pulsed component .",
    "however , when the pulsed component is harder ( softer ) than the constant emission , local minimum of fractional variation appears in the soft ( hard ) band , and the fractional variation turns to increase for higher flux . this is considered to be due to a \" cross - talk between the energy bands through the dead time .",
    "when the incident flux is much larger than @xmath86 , which corresponds to the maximum detectable count rate , detected count rate in the two energy bands tend to show anti - correlation , because the total detectable count rate is limited by @xmath86 .",
    "this anti - correlation tends to cancel out the original variation of the energy bin .",
    "the local minimum of @xmath75 in the figure indicates that the original time variation of the energy bin is almost completely canceled out by the anti - correlation from the other energy bin .",
    "note that this cancelation is not perfect , because the time variation is not sinusoidal under the effect of dead time . for larger incident flux ,",
    "variation due to the anti - correlation overcomes the original variation , and the total variation increases with the increase of incident flux . in this extreme flux range , time variations in the two energy bins",
    "are anti - correlated .",
    "conversely , with the assumptions that the pulse profiles are sinusoidal and that both the constant ( non - pulsed ) and pulsed components have power law energy spectra , we can calculate the ( dead time corrected ) pulse fractions from the detected ( dead time included ) pulse fractions .",
    "using the average flux of about 160 c / s of l1 data and the photon index for the constant component of about @xmath87 ( see section 3.3 ) , we found that the best - fit photon index of the pulsed component is @xmath88 .",
    "thus the energy dependent pulse fraction with no dead time is calculated , and is given in figure 7 with the solid line .",
