    "weak gravitational lensing refers to the weak and systematic shape distortions of background source images ( galaxies , cmb , etc . ) by the foreground inhomogeneous density distributions on cosmological scales .",
    "since this effect only involves gravity , it has been widely used as a direct probe of matter density fluctuations of our universe ( see , , @xcite for a recent review ) .    the weak lensing effect can only be probed statistically due to the fact that the intrinsic projected shape of each galaxy is always somewhat random and anisotropic .",
    "a central theme in the study of weak lensing is to find unbiased cosmic shear estimators on galaxy images .",
    "this is indeed very challenging because the shape distortion due to weak lensing is generally much weaker than the intrinsic variations of the galaxy shapes .",
    "in the early stage of this field , most of the work focused on issues regarding the use of the quadrupole moments of a galaxy image as a shear estimator ( @xcite ) .",
    "ever since then , a number of other shear estimators have been considered in the literature , including moments defined by a certain set of orthogonal functions ( @xcite ) , the spatial derivatives of the galaxy surface brightness field ( @xcite ) , etc ..    conventionally , for each shear component , the shear estimator is simply one number derived from a galaxy image , whose statistical mean is supposed to be equal to the true shear value , provided that the intrinsic galaxy image is statistically isotropic .",
    "unfortunately , even in the absence of the psf , we show that such shear estimators at least do not exist in simple forms , making them hard to use in practice for precise shear measurements ( , in the presence of noise ) . in the presence of the psf",
    ", we argue that such shear estimators do not likely exist .",
    "we give reasons for the above statements in  [ not_exist ] .",
    "( the readers who are just interested in our new way of measuring shears may skip this section . )    in  [ alternatives ] , we present a new form of shear estimators : instead of having only one number from each galaxy image for each shear component , one can keep _ two _ numbers , and use the ratio of their averages over many galaxies to accurately measure the cosmic shear .",
    "we find that this new way of measuring the shear can be easily implemented by using the method of zhang ( 2008 ) ( z08 hereafter ) .",
    "the new type of shear estimator requires weak lensing statistics such as the n - point correlation functions of the shear field to be carried out in a slightly unusual way , but with little additional cost .",
    "this is discussed in  [ statistics ] . in  [ examples ] , we give numerical examples . finally , we summarize in  [ summary ] .",
    "conventional shear estimators are defined as a class of shear estimators , which average over a single quantity per galaxy to estimate each shear component .",
    "most of the existing shear measurement methods belong to this class .",
    "for example , the method by kaiser et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and its extensions basically use the quadrupole moments of each gaussian - profile - weighted galaxy image to measure the shear components ; in the shapelets method ( @xcite ) , the value of each shear component is estimated from best - fitting a shapelets model to each observed galaxy image ; the method of bernstein and jarvis ( 2002 ) evaluate the shear components by fitting each galaxy shape ( also the psf ) with a series of orthogonal 2d gaussian - based functions ( see , , @xcite for more examples ) .",
    "a common feature of these methods is that they all generate one quantity per galaxy for each shear component .    in  [ classic ] , we start our discussion with the well - known examples of shear estimators consisting of quadrupole moments of galaxy images , and show what the issues are . in  [ no_psf ] , we show that , even in the absence of the psf , any conventional shear estimator has to reduce to a _",
    "highly _ nonlinear form , making it hard to use in practice . in  [ prove ] ,",
    "we provide arguments as to why we think that conventional shear estimators do not likely exist when a psf is present .",
    "the use of galaxy quadrupole moments as shear estimators has been a central topic in weak lensing for many years .",
    "it is therefore easier to start our discussion with the quadrupole moments . to present the issues clearly ,",
    "let us first consider the case without the psf or any photon noise . for convenience ,",
    "we use @xmath0 or @xmath1 instead of @xmath2 for coordinates in 2d in this paper .",
    "suppose that the surface brightness field of the lensed galaxy image is @xmath3 on the image plane , and that of the original ( pre - lensing ) galaxy image is @xmath4 on the source plane , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the position angles on the image and source planes , respectively .",
    "we have the following relations : @xmath7 where @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , which are the spatial derivatives of the lensing deflection angle .",
    "@xmath10 can also be written as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is sometimes called the lensing potential .",
    "matrix @xmath13 can be alternatively written in terms of the convergence @xmath14 and the two shear components @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the quadrupole moments of the lensed galaxy image are defined as follows : @xmath17 where the origin of the coordinates has been chosen to be the center of the light , , @xmath18 let us also define the ellipticities of the image as : @xmath19    in the absence of the psf , the quantities @xmath20 and @xmath21 are often thought to be good estimators for @xmath22 and @xmath23 up to the first order in the shear .",
    "let us find out if they are indeed unbiased shear estimators .",
    "the observed quadrupole can be rewritten from using eq.([fifstits ] ) in eq.([q_moments ] ) : @xmath24 note that the last step of the above equation is achieved by redefining @xmath25 as @xmath26 .",
    "keeping up to first order in @xmath27 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 in eq.([q2 ] ) , we get : @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the quadrupole moments of the original galaxy image defined as : @xmath30 note that the two light centers defined in the image and source planes coincide . based on eq.([q3 ] ) , we find : @xmath31 - 2\\gamma_2\\epsilon_1^s\\epsilon_2^s\\\\ \\nonumber \\epsilon_2&=&\\frac{\\epsilon_2^s+2\\gamma_2}{1 + 2\\gamma_1\\epsilon_1^s+2\\gamma_2\\epsilon_2^s}\\\\ \\nonumber & = & \\epsilon_2^s+2\\gamma_2\\left[1-\\left(\\epsilon_2^s\\right)^2\\right]-2\\gamma_1\\epsilon_1^s\\epsilon_2^s\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 given that the surface brightness distribution of the original galaxy image is statistically isotropic , we have @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",

    "( also see eq.(3.29 ) of bernstein & jarvis ( 2002 ) , or eq.(9.5.26 ) of weinberg ( 2008 ) . )",
    "one can construct an unbiased estimator of the shear , if one keeps three quantities from each lensed galaxy , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , and use the ratios of their averages . assuming statistical isotropy of intrinsic galaxy shapes in eq.([q3 ] ) , and keeping up to first order in shear / convergence , we have ( also see eq.(9.5.30 ) of weinberg ( 2008 ) ) : @xmath40 this form of shear estimators is not conventional , as one has to keep more than one quantities from each galaxy image for each shear component .",
    "it is this class of estimators we shall discuss in this paper in detail",
    ".    one may wonder whether unbiased shear estimators in the conventional form ever exist .",
    "the answer is yes , at least when the psf is absent .",
    "for example , we find the following unbiased shear estimators : @xmath41 eq.([q7 ] ) can be checked by applying taylor expansion of @xmath42 $ ] ( @xmath43 ) to the first order in shear / convergence using eq.([q4 ] ) .",
    "eq.([q7 ] ) defines a special type of conventional shear estimators that are accidentally found by us .",
    "it is now immediately interesting to ask if there exist other types of unbiased shear estimators in the conventional form .",
    "we study this issue specifically in the next two sections .",
    "if the readers wish to go directly to the relevant sections on the new estimator , read on from  [ alternatives ] .    for notational convenience , we shall abbreviate `` conventional shear estimator '' as `` cse '' in the rest of the paper . once again , by cse we mean the shear estimators that are made of just one number measured from a galaxy image for each shear component .",
    "in preparation for our main theme of this section , we discuss the spin properties of cosmic shears and their estimators in ",
    "[ coor_spin ] .",
    "we then study the forms of cses in the absence of the psf in ",
    "[ spin_2_esti ] .      to study the forms of the cses , it is useful to first consider their properties under coordinate rotations .",
    "suppose we rotate the coordinates @xmath1 clockwise by an angle @xmath44 .",
    "the new coordinates @xmath45 are related to the old one via the following relation : @xmath46 if we write the position vector as a complex number of the form @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the complex unit , the coordinate transformation under rotation can then be written as : @xmath49 for notational brevity , we shall generally use @xmath50 to denote the value of any quantity @xmath51 in the new coordinates that are rotated clockwise by an angle @xmath44 with respect to the original coordinates .",
    "let us now discuss how cosmic shears and their cses transform under coordinate rotation .",
    "the definitions of the shear components ( shown in the beginning of  [ classic ] ) involve spatial derivatives ; thus , their transformation rules under coordinate rotation can be found from the chain rule : @xmath52 from eq.([coor_trans ] ) , we get : @xmath53 therefore , we have : @xmath54 taking the square of eq.([coor_trans_complex_2 ] ) , we find : @xmath55\\exp(\\ima 2\\theta)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , the shear components , which are 2nd order derivatives of the lensing potential @xmath12 , also transform under coordinate rotation as : @xmath56 because of this property , we usually say that cosmic shears form a spin-2 quantity",
    ". in general , a complex quantity , say @xmath57 , is called a spin-@xmath58 quantity if it transforms as @xmath59 under a clockwise coordinate rotation of angle @xmath44 .",
    "now let us discuss shear estimators .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the cses defined in eq.([q7 ] ) do not form a spin-2 quantity . more generally , assuming that @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the cses for @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively , then , unlike @xmath62 , @xmath63 is not necessarily a spin-2 quantity .",
    "however , it turns out that we can regularize any cses by turning them into components of a spin-2 quantity .",
    "we have the following lemma :    [ turn_spin_2 ] based on any pair of cses @xmath64 , one can build a new pair of cses @xmath65 to form a spin-2 quantity through the following procedure : @xmath66    firstly , under a clockwise coordinate rotation by angle @xmath67 , we have : @xmath68\\left(\\gamma_1^{\\theta'}+\\ima\\gamma_2^{\\theta'}\\right)\\\\ \\nonumber & = & \\left(\\gamma_1'+\\ima\\gamma_2'\\right)\\exp(\\ima 2\\theta_0)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , @xmath69 form a spin-2 quantity . to show that @xmath65 are a pair of cses ,",
    "let us take the ensemble average on both sides of eq .",
    "( [ trans_spin_2_rot ] ) : @xmath70 since by definition , @xmath71 and @xmath72 measure the shear values in the rotated coordinates , we have , @xmath73 in a more compact form , we can write eq.([gamma_theta ] ) as : @xmath74 using eq .",
    "( [ gamma_theta2 ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ trans_ideal_esti ] ) , we get : @xmath75 which proves that @xmath65 are indeed also a pair of cses .",
    "due to the invariance under a coordinate rotation of angle @xmath76 , one can always decompose any shear estimator into components of integer spins .",
    "eq.([trans_spin_2 ] ) essentially defines a procedure of isolating the spin-2 components of any cses using fourier transformation .",
    "since the cosmic shears form a spin-2 quantity , only the spin-2 components of any cses are the relevant / principle components of the estimators .",
    "this point is further supported by the fact that the ensemble averages of spin-@xmath58 ( @xmath77 ) components of any cses are zero , , @xmath78 therefore , we only need to focus on spin-2 cses from here on .      in the weak lensing limit , ,",
    "when the cosmic shear parameters @xmath79 are small , any spin-2 cses @xmath64 can be taylor expanded to the first order in shear as follows : @xmath80 where @xmath81 ( @xmath51 is any quantity ) denotes the value of @xmath51 at @xmath82 . since @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 are all spin-2 quantities , their ensemble average must vanish . on the other hand , the coefficients associated with @xmath22 and @xmath23 in eq.([taylor_weak_lensing ] ) can be decomposed into spin-0 and spin-4 components as follows : @xmath87 where @xmath88 as shown in appendix a , @xmath89 is a scalar , @xmath90 is a pseudo scalar , @xmath91 is a spin-4 quantity .",
    "the ensemble averages of @xmath92 and @xmath93 must vanish .",
    "the ensemble average of @xmath90 vanishes if galaxy images have parity symmetry along any direction in the plane of the sky statistically , which is assumed to be true in this paper .",
    "consequently , for @xmath64 to be spin-2 cses , we only require @xmath94 .",
    "this actually implies that for any individual galaxy , @xmath95 .",
    "the reason is that @xmath89 of any single galaxy does not change under coordinate rotation of random angles , and is equal to @xmath96 because the galaxies generated by rotations of a single galaxy form a complete set of statistically isotropic samples ( , there are no special directions ) . as a result , any spin-2 cses @xmath64 must satisfy the following necessary condition : @xmath97 this is also a sufficient condition , because @xmath95 directly implies that @xmath94 .",
    "in general , the cses are functions of a certain number of shape parameters ( , the multipole moments of an image ) .",
    "the functions can be very complicated , and are certainly not fixed by the requirement given by eq.([requirement ] ) .",
    "however , for galaxies whose shapes are described by only three parameters ( perfect ellipses ) , any cse should reduce to a function of just three variables . in this case , we find that any pair of spin-2 cses must reduce to a unique form , which is sufficient for us to judge whether cses are convenient in practice : namely , if we find that the resulting form is highly non - linear even for such a simple case , then it is reasonable to conclude that cses are not so useful for accurate shear measurements from more realistic galaxy shapes as well .",
    "this is shown in the rest of this section . for clarity",
    ", we refer the readers to appendix b for the mathematical details / proofs for some of the statements made hereafter in this section .",
    "let us consider a set of galaxies whose surface brightness profiles can be parametrized as @xmath98 with @xmath99 , where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the coordinates , @xmath98 is a function of a fixed form , and @xmath102 are the three parameters determining galaxy shapes . for the images to be ellipses , we require the following three things : 1 .",
    "@xmath98 decays sufficiently fast when @xmath103 becomes large ; 2 . @xmath104 ; 3 .",
    "@xmath105 . for example , if @xmath106 ( @xmath107 is the step function ) and @xmath102 satisfy the above conditions , the galaxy surface brightness is then distributed evenly inside the ellipse defined by @xmath108 .",
    "when such images are weakly lensed , the three conditions are not violated , and @xmath102 becomes @xmath109 without changing the form of @xmath110 .",
    "in other words , weak lensing does not introduce additional degrees of freedom to the galaxy shapes .",
    "note that otherwise , one has to consider using more than 3 parameters to construct shear estimators . among the three parameters , there are indeed only two degrees of freedom useful for shear measurement : the ratios of the parameters .",
    "this is because the overall amplitudes of @xmath102 only change the galaxy size , not its shape .",
    "as shown in appendix b , the ellipticities @xmath111 defined in ",
    "[ classic ] are directly equal to @xmath112 , therefore , we can write the shear estimators as functions of only @xmath20 and @xmath21 .    we can further show that @xmath64 must take the following form : @xmath113 where @xmath114 , and @xmath115 is a one - variable complex function , whose form is to be determined later in this section . to see why eq.([g_1_g_2_form ] )",
    "is true , one can use the taylor expansion to write @xmath60 and @xmath61 as power series of @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "consequently , one can write @xmath63 as power series of @xmath116 and @xmath117 , whose spins are @xmath118 and @xmath119 respectively . since @xmath63 is a spin-2 quantity , each term in the power series must also be a spin-2 quantity . therefore , in each term of the power series , the power on @xmath116 must be larger than that on @xmath117 by exactly one , , each term must take the form of @xmath120 , where @xmath58 is any non - negative integer , and @xmath121 is a coefficient which can be any complex number at this point . as a result",
    ", the shear estimators must have the form defined in eq.([g_1_g_2_form ] ) . to find out what @xmath122 is ,",
    "let us write it as @xmath123 .",
    "( [ g_1_g_2_form ] ) then becomes : @xmath124 using the constraint in eq.([requirement ] ) , we find : @xmath125 it is interesting to note that eq.([constraint ] ) does not place any constraints on @xmath126 , , it can be any real function .",
    "this is because @xmath126 simply adds unnecessary even - parity terms into odd parity ones , and vice versa , without affecting the ensemble averages and the spin of the shear estimators . for convenience",
    ", we set @xmath127 hereafter .",
    "eq.([constraint ] ) is a typical first - order ordinary differential equation .",
    "it can be solved by introducing an integrating factor @xmath128 which satisfies : @xmath129\\ ] ] multiplying both sides of eq.([constraint ] ) with @xmath128 , we get : @xmath130=k(u)\\ ] ] it is now straightforward to solve both eq.([ku ] ) and eq.([g_1_u ] ) .",
    "the results are : @xmath131 where @xmath90 is a real number constant . to guarantee that @xmath60 and @xmath61 do not diverge when @xmath20 and @xmath21 approach zero , we need @xmath132 .",
    "finally , we find the unique form for the spin-2 cses : @xmath133 regarding the uniqueness , it is useful to note that if we transform the cses defined in eq.([q7 ] ) into spin-2 shear estimators using the procedure given in eq.([trans_spin_2 ] ) , we achieve the same shear estimators as those shown in eq.([g_1_g_2_form_final ] ) .",
    "we have shown that the principle components ( spin-2 ) of any pair of cses have to take specific and _ highly _ nonlinear forms for galaxies of elliptical shapes .",
    "this feature makes cses not convenient in practice ( , in the presence of noise ) .",
    "any cses which correct for the psf effect also have to reduce to the forms given in eq.([g_1_g_2_form_final ] ) in the limit of zero psf size when the galaxy images have pure elliptical shapes .",
    "for this reason , the conclusion in the previous section is already sufficient to argue against the usefulness of cses in practice . for academic interests ,",
    "we provide the following arguments for why cses may not even exist in the presence of the psf :    in the presence of the point spread function , structural details of galaxy images on scales smaller than the size of the psf are smeared out .",
    "this implies that there are only a finite number of shape parameters ( , multipole moments up to some order ) available for constructing shear estimators .",
    "on the other hand , the derivatives of the lower order shape parameters ( , lower order multipole moments ) with respect to the cosmic shears depend on the higher order shape parameters because of the psf , suggesting the requirement for an infinite number of shape parameters to form the shear estimators . combining the above two reasons , we find it unlikely to form cses when a psf is present .",
    "the mathematical details of the above statements are given in appendix c.",
    "as searching for optimal shear estimators is actively ongoing nowadays ( @xcite ) , it is important to realize that cses ( `` conventional shear estimators , '' by which we mean the shear estimators that are made of just one number from a galaxy image for each shear component ) are hard to use in practice due to their unavoidable complex forms even in the absence of the psf ( simpler forms , such as the quadrupole moments , are biased estimators , as shown in   2.1 ) .    therefore , existing shear estimators of the conventional type must quantify the bias factor when estimating the shear , which can be achieved numerically ( see , , erben et al .",
    "2001 , bacon et al .",
    "2001 , or most recently , @xcite ) or estimated analytically ( , shear susceptibility in ksb [ kaiser et al . 1995 ] and derived methods , or responsivity factor in bernstein & jarvis 2002 and similar methods ) , although most people have been mainly focusing on the systematic errors caused by the photon noise and the psf .",
    "however , to achieve percent or even sub - percent level accuracy in cosmic shear measurements , it does not seem enough to completely rely on numerical tests using computer - generated galaxies of limited morphology richness , or approximate analytical methods .",
    "unfortunately , in the presence of psf , most of the existing shear measurement methods are too complicated or too model - dependent ( @xcite ) to allow for an accurate analytic analysis of the systematic errors in their shear estimators .",
    "the method of z08 ( see also @xcite for the treatment of photon noise and the pixelation effect ) is easily amenable to the corrections described in eq.([q5 ] ) , and can also account for the psf correction .",
    "not only is it simple , but also well defined regardless of the morphologies of galaxies and the psf .",
    "we show here how to properly use this method ( instead of using it as cses ) to recover the cosmic shear in an unbiased way .",
    "the basic idea of z08 is to use the spatial derivatives of the galaxy surface brightness field to measure the cosmic shears .",
    "it relies on the fact that gravitational lensing does not only distort the overall shape of the object , but also locally modifies the anisotropy of the gradient field of the surface brightness .",
    "as it allows for using the shape information from galaxy substructures , the method of z08 can potentially improve on the signal - to - noise ratio of the shear measurements .",
    "it is shown in z08 that the shear measurement should be carried out in the fourier space , in which any psf can be transformed into the desired isotropic gaussian form through multiplications , and the spatial derivatives of the surface brightness field can be easily measured .",
    "the cosmic shear can be estimated using the following relations : @xmath134 where @xmath135 @xmath136 is the scale radius of the isotropic gaussian psf @xmath137 , which is defined as : @xmath138 @xmath139 is the surface brightness field .",
    "@xmath140 denotes @xmath141 .",
    "as shown in appendix d , the method of z08 effectively utilizes the quadrupole moments in the fourier space to measure the cosmic shears .",
    "now , here is an important point : in order to implement this method , we must make it clear what we mean by the angular brackets in eq.([shear12psf ] ) .",
    "first , we need to measure the derivatives of the surface brightness and average them within a single galaxy .",
    "let us denote this averaging by @xmath142 , and write : @xmath143 of course , these are still extremely noisy as they use only one galaxy .",
    "the question is then , `` how do we average these quantities over many galaxies to obtain an unbiased estimator of the shears ? ''    if one uses these quantities as if they were the cses , then one would simply average them over many galaxies .",
    "however , this will produce a biased estimator : ) used for the average was still too small . ]",
    "@xmath144 where @xmath145 and @xmath146 are the ensemble averages of functions of multipole moments of the galaxy images in fourier space , and @xmath147 denotes the ensemble average over many galaxies .",
    "the derivation of the forms of @xmath145 and @xmath146 is given in appendix d. @xmath145 and @xmath146 are generally nonzero and dependent on the galaxy morphology .    instead , we need to take the ensemble averages of the numerator and the denominator separately first , and then divide them to obtain an unbiased estimator : @xmath148 this is the main result of this paper , and the form of the unbiased estimator that we propose to use for the actual analysis of the weak lensing data .    of course , one could divide the left hand sides of eq.([shear12psf_wrong ] ) by @xmath149 and @xmath150 to obtain an unbiased estimator .",
    "this is similar to correcting the measured shear for a multiplicative bias that is evaluated from the same ensemble of galaxies . in this sense ,",
    "eq.([shear12psf_wrong ] ) provides the exact definitions for the multiplicative biases for @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "however , since @xmath145 and @xmath146 in eq.([shear12psf_wrong ] ) involve many high order fourier - space multipole moments of the surface brightness field , evaluation of these terms from simulations ( which are incomplete anyway ) can be highly uncertain .",
    "even worse , the multiplicative bias mentioned here is not even a constant , but depends on the morphological distribution of the galaxies .",
    "this makes the conventional way of measuring shear correlation functions even more challenging , as one must take into account the _ correlations _ of the multiplicative biases , as will be shown in  [ statistics ] .    in summary , according to eq.([shear12psf2 ] ) , for each shear component , two quantities from each galaxy should be kept , and the ratios of their ensemble averages yield unbiased estimates for the corresponding shear components . finally , it is important to note that , to efficiently use eq.([shear12psf2 ] ) , the surface brightness of each participating galaxy should be normalized to have roughly the same maximum value , so that faint galaxies are not much less weighted than their brighter counterparts .",
    "the details regarding the optimal weighting scheme as a function of the galaxy luminosity should also take into account the photon noise .",
    "this is a separate topic , and will be studied in a future work .      strictly speaking , eq.([shear12psf2 ] )",
    "holds when we average over an infinite number of galaxies ; however , as we shall show in this section , the error that we make by having a finite number of galaxies for averaging is much smaller than the statistical errors , and thus the estimator remains unbiased for practical applications .    for simplicity , we use eq.([q6 ] ) rather than our main equation [ eq.([shear12psf2 ] ) ] in the following discussion , but the conclusion will be the same for eq.([shear12psf2 ] ) .",
    "let us use @xmath151 to denote the average of the quantity @xmath51 over @xmath152 galaxies . from eq.([q3 ] ) , we get : @xmath153 consequently , we have : @xmath154 where @xmath155 here , the terms @xmath156 and @xmath157 contribute to random errors because their ensemble averages vanish , whereas the terms @xmath158 and @xmath159 lead to systematic biases because their ensemble averages do not vanish . fortunately , as @xmath160 scales as @xmath161 and @xmath162 , the amplitudes of such systematic biases are always much smaller than the sizes of the statistical errors .",
    "therefore , the results from this new type of shear estimators may be regarded as unbiased for practical applications .",
    "numerical verifications will be given in  [ examples ] .",
    "the cosmic shear field can only be probed statistically .",
    "this is mainly due to the intrinsic variations of the galaxy shapes and the spatial fluctuations of the shear components . as a result",
    ", the shear statistics is usually studied in the form of n - point spatial correlation functions of the shear field .",
    "the previous discussions and measurements in the literature are based on `` conventional '' shear estimators ( cses ) , , one often assumes that the following is true : @xmath163 where @xmath164 can be either @xmath22 or @xmath23 , and @xmath165 is a cse for @xmath164 . for individual galaxies , eq.([assume_wr ] ) implies : @xmath166 where @xmath167 satisfies @xmath168 . ] .",

    "we can rewrite eq.([requirement_stronger ] ) for , , @xmath60 , using the chain rule as : @xmath327 since there are only a finite number of multipole moments available for constructing the shear estimators , we assume the maximum value of @xmath318 is @xmath152 ( n is an even integer ) , , we have : @xmath328 because the right side of eq.([gamma_1_chain_rule2 ] ) is evaluated at @xmath82 , both @xmath329 and @xmath330 are functions of only @xmath331 s , , the multipole moments in the absence of lensing .    as in eq.([mij_trans ] ) , one can show in general that @xmath330 involves higher order multipole moments , , @xmath332 s with @xmath333 . in particular , when @xmath334 , @xmath330 depends linearly on @xmath332 s with @xmath335 .",
    "to satisfy the constraint in eq.([gamma_1_chain_rule2 ] ) , the coefficients in front of the terms proportional to @xmath332 s ( @xmath335 ) must vanish because they are independent of the multipole moments with @xmath336 . as a result",
    ", we find that @xmath329 has to vanish when @xmath334 .",
    "in other words , we have : @xmath337 we can now recursively use the above reasoning to show that there does not exist an @xmath152 that can satisfy eq.([gamma_1_chain_rule2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we can never find cses of the type defined in eq.([requirement_stronger ] ) .",
    "though , one may still expect to find cses based on the most general requirement defined in eq.([requirement_again ] ) .",
    "however , even in this case , cses _ must _ reduce to highly nonlinear forms for galaxies of pure elliptical shapes when the psf effect is small , as we have shown in  [ spin_2_esti ] .",
    "this feature is already sufficient for arguing against their usefulness in practice .",
    "let us now calculate the terms @xmath145 and @xmath146 defined in eq.([shear12psf_wrong ] ) .",
    "the averages of the spatial derivatives of the surface brightness field of a single galaxy can be related to the fourier modes of the image .",
    "the fourier transformation has been defined in eq.([fourier ] ) in appendix c. following the notations of appendix c , we find : @xmath338 and @xmath339 where @xmath340 is the total area of the map containing the galaxy .",
    "similarly , one can derive the following relation : @xmath341 eq.([rf_derivative_aves ] ) and eq.([rf_derive2 ] ) allow us to transform eq.([shear12psf_wrong ] ) into its version in fourier space : @xmath342 where @xmath343 note that @xmath344 .",
