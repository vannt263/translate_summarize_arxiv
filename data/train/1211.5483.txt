    "we can , using beam - splitters , phase - shifters , and detectors , coherently manipulate photons and make measurements . specifically in the continuous - variable regime , brighter sources of light are available than for single photon , discrete , light sources .",
    "these features have motivated research into the usefulness of photonic systems for quantum cryptography , communication and distributed quantum information processing  @xcite .",
    "discrete protocols , for finite - dimensional systems with arbitrary quantum control , do not typically have exact analogs but rather cousins in the linear optical setting .",
    "any two qubit entangled state can be distilled by local operations  @xcite , whereas distillation of entangled gaussian state using linear optics is impossible  @xcite .",
    "soon after these impossibility proofs were obtained , it was discovered that an initially non - gaussian state could , using only linear optics , enable entanglement distillation  @xcite . the original distillation protocol , which is conditioned on detectors finding no photons , outputs a state that evolves toward a gaussian . over the years , this protocol has inspired several variants that have been found to exhibit the same gaussification phenomena  @xcite .",
    "similar  no - go \" results @xcite prohibit the distillation of highly squeezed states using only passive linear optics , although with relaxed constraints some proposals are possible  @xcite .    leaving",
    "the realm of purely gaussian operations is essential for entanglement distillation , but unfortunately non - gaussian operations are much more experimentally challenging .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to keep non - gaussian operations to a minimum . in the aforementioned protocols , and those considered herein",
    ", only the initial noisy resource needs to be non - gaussian .",
    "a source of gaussian entangled states , such as those emitted by a pumped parametric downconverter , can be probabilistically de - gaussified by adding or subtracting single photons through the use of single photon detectors and/or sources  @xcite .",
    "an additional benefit of de - gaussification is that it too can increase the entanglement and other figures of merit , such as the teleportation fidelity  @xcite .",
    "some matter systems ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) also provide a more direct source of non - gaussian entangled photons .",
    "these are the most experimentally feasible means of non - gaussian state preparation , but the potential advantage of exploiting more exotic forms of non - gaussianity has also been considered  @xcite .",
    "the need for non - gaussian operations extends beyond distillation problems , and they are required to violate locality  @xcite and to outperform classical computers  @xcite .",
    "these applications have kindled an interest in the idea of wigner function negativity as a resource  @xcite .    until now ,",
    "known protocols that gaussify and distill entanglement have the feature of being recursive . to execute these protocols to greater depth",
    "requires greater memory storage requirements .",
    "the quantum states are combined via a tree like process of pairwise distillation , with each branch demanding additional memory . in the finite dimensional",
    "setting , entanglement pumping protocols  @xcite offer the option of compressing the spatial memory requirement , even down to 3 - 4 qubits per location , at the cost of reduced efficiency and increased temporal overheads .",
    "recently , a continuous variable analog of entanglement pumping , the compact distillery scheme , has been proposed  @xcite .",
    "this scheme requires storage of only 2 modes per location at any moment in time .",
    "however , this pumping protocol is not a direct analog of the gaussification protocols . in particular , the compact distillery does not gaussify and allows only a modest increase in entanglement .    here , we extend and further develop the techniques of ref .",
    "@xcite where the class of gaussification protocols was vastly broadened and shown to work in virtue of quantum central limit theorems .",
    "this work broadens the class of gaussifer protocols , and in doing so introduces the concept of a pumping - gaussifier that only requires 2 modes of memory per location .",
    "unlike the compact distillery scheme , our pumping protocol still gaussifies and is capable of the same large increases of entanglement possible with the recursive - gaussifier .",
    "surprisingly , the pumping - gaussifer outputs the same final state as the more well known recursive - gaussifiers .",
    "this makes pumping - gaussifers extremely promising protocols that are especially attractive for experiments with only a small number of modes .",
    "we also comment on implications of our findings to devising novel schemes for long distance quantum communication via quantum repeater networks . despite considerable research on cv entanglement distillation ,",
    "surprisingly these techniques have not previously been explicitly applied to design of quantum repeaters . indeed , here",
    ", we provide the first concrete evidence in the cv context that using quantum repeaters can achieve greater distances of communication than direct transmission .    on a technical level",
    ", the approach taken here is complementary to , but subtly distinct from , our earlier results @xcite . in particular , compared to these earlier results , the relationship between quantum central limit theorems and gaussification protocols requires a smaller and simpler set of assumptions required of the physical system .",
    "center stage is taken by a class of non - commutative central limit theorems , which are general enough to capture all of the aforementioned situations of state manipulation , including post - selecting measurements .",
    "the requirements for a quantum central limit theorem to be valid will be highlighted and discussed in great detail .",
    "we remark that these techniques are closely related to those used to prove the extremality principle  @xcite ; which asserts that for entanglement measures satisfying very specific properties  , gaussian states have the least entanglement of all states with the same second moments .",
    "here , we introduce our notation and briefly introduce some phase space concepts used throughout . for more details",

    "the wigner function , which is perhaps more widely known , is simply the fourier transform of the characteristic function . since the fourier transform maps the set of gaussian functions to itself , the definition of gaussian states is equivalent if stated in terms of wigner functions . for our purposes",

    "many single mode central limit sequences there will exist a choice of @xmath280 that satisfies both these requirements , though some counterexamples do exist .",
    "for multi - mode problems , pure squeezed or entangled state can make suitable reference states .",
    "above , we focused on the even moments of the gaussian state .",

    "larger values of @xmath324 provide more entanglement in the final state , and we have numerically found that larger values also produce repeater networks capable of reaching larger distances . however , larger values of @xmath324 also significantly reduce the success probability of de - gaussification .",

    ", the additional noise of the latter model does slightly reduce the maximum distance , but the decrease is very small .",

    "a possible explanation for this feature is that the more squeezed the initial state the more mixed the final state after suffering photon loss .",
