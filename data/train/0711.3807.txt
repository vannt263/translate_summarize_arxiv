    "in the last decade substantial efforts have been invested in integrating chemical processes into microfluidic systems known as `` labs on a chip '' @xcite .",
    "these microfluidic devices do not only allow for cheap mass production but they can also operate with much smaller quantities of reactants and reaction products than standard laboratory equipments .    in this context both closed and open channel systems are considered for fluid transport . while closed channels are prone to clogging by , e.g. , colloids or large biopolymers , the fluid in open channel systems has less friction because it is in contact with less substrate material , and production is possibly cheaper .",
    "the substrate surfaces can be structured chemically by printing or photographic techniques .",
    "conceptually , the liquid is guided by lyophilic stripes on an otherwise lyophobic substrate @xcite , i.e. , it is confined by laterally varying substrate potentials , acting as `` chemical walls '' .    here",
    "we analyze the stability of homogeneously filled chemical channels with respect to pearling , i.e. , breakup into a string of droplets .",
    "for all contact angles , on _ homogeneous _ substrates sessile filaments ( ridges ) of nonvolatile liquids are unstable with respect to pearling , even in the presence of line tension @xcite .",
    "however , in the cases that the contact line is infinitely stiff or pinned , e.g. , at the edges of a chemical channel formed by a lyophilic stripe on an otherwise lyophobic substrate , the instability is suppressed if the contact angle of the liquid - vapor interface with the substrate is smaller than @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations have confirmed this even at the nano - scale @xcite .    from these results",
    "it is not clear whether complete pinning is required to stabilize a liquid ridge . in an actual sample",
    "the three phase contact angle will not vary step - like at the channel edge .",
    "one rather expects a gradual transition , which leads to a _ partial _ stabilization : the contact line can move but the lateral variation of the effective contact angle will impose a restoring force .",
    "in this paper we use a mesoscopic hydrodynamic model to describe a nonvolatile fluid on a chemical stripe with such partial stabilization by realistic ( i.e. , not step - like ) edges .",
    "we use a numerical scheme based on the thin film approximation , assuming a sharp liquid - gas interface , partial wetting on both the stripe and the embedding substrate , small contact angles , and smooth lateral variations of the disjoining pressure .",
    "analytical estimates can be obtained within appropriate macroscopic approximations , the validity of which we discuss in the context of finite size issues .    in accordance with king et al .",
    "@xcite , without drive and on a homogeneous substrate we find that cylinder - like sessile ridges are stationary but prone to a rayleigh - plateau type pearling instability .",
    "we generalize the analytical macroscopic stability criterion for liquid ridges on chemical channels with sharp boundaries @xcite to the case of smooth chemical steps .",
    "a linear stability analysis allows us to account for the occurrence of large - wavelength pearling , both numerically and analytically .",
    "the presence of a chemical stripe partially stabilizes the ridge with respect to pearling .",
    "the analytical criterion for the stability of a pinned ridge is in good accordance with the stability domain found numerically .",
    "we also find a quantitative agreement between the growth rate of long - wavelength pearling obtained from numerical stability analysis and its corresponding analytical expression obtained by a perturbative analysis .",
    "external drive applied along the ridge always has an overall stabilizing effect .",
    "however , drive never completely stabilizes an unstable liquid ridge but merely shifts the domain of unstable modes to larger wave lengths .    in the next section [ sec : system ]",
    "we introduce the system we consider as well as the numerical method we use , along with a discussion of finite size effects . in sec .",

    "schematic view of the investigated system .",
    "the substrate is topographically flat , invariant in the @xmath1 direction , chemically heterogeneous and @xmath2-periodic in the @xmath3 direction .",
    "a liquid ridge forms above the lyophilic stripe ( grey ) of width @xmath4 centered on the @xmath1-axis and a wetting film covers the surrounding lyophobic regions ( black ) .",
    "a body force aligned with the @xmath1-axis ( caused , e.g. , by a substrate tilt ) generates flow along the stripe . the local film thickness at time @xmath5 is given by @xmath6 .",
    "depending on the characteristics of the chemical stripe , the ridge may be subject to pearling instabilities ( exaggerated ) . ]    as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ cap : setup ] we consider a viscous , incompressible , and nonvolatile fluid on a partially wetting substrate featuring a straight `` chemical channel '' , i.e. , a lyophilic stripe with macroscopic axial extension separating two lyophobic domains .",
    "the equilibrium contact angle is smaller on the channel than on the surrounding , macroscopically wide , homogeneous substrate . for reasons given below",
    ", our analysis requires a finite spatial extent @xmath2 in the transverse @xmath3 direction . for convenience",
    "we assume periodic boundary conditions at @xmath7  .",
    "@xmath8 is taken to be large enough so that the stripe of width @xmath4 can be considered as isolated . in this `` chemical channel ''",
    "a liquid ridge of local thickness can be formed if the amount of liquid is sufficiently large .",
    "the local thickness @xmath9 includes possible variations in the vicinity of the ridge - like stationary solution .",
    "for such a configuration , the film has an almost uniform thickness @xmath10 far from the stripe and one can define the excess cross sectional area @xmath11\\label{eq : vex}\\ ] ] of the liquid in the channel . for @xmath1-invariant stationary solutions this quantity corresponds to the excess volume of liquid per unit length on top of the wetting film and",
    "thus adequately characterizes the extra amount of liquid in the system independently of the finite lateral size @xmath2 .",
    "we consider a finite lateral system size for the following reason . given a configuration in which a macroscopic ridge is in stable mechanical equilibrium with the wetting film on a substrate of finite width , extending the system size @xmath2 at constant excess cross - section eventually leads to an unstable configuration : upon transferring liquid from the ridge into the wetting film the pressure inside the ridge increases more than in the wetting film and the ridge will drain into the film .",
    "therefore the only globally stable configuration on arbitrarily large substrates is a basically flat wetting film with a slightly increased thickness above the channel @xcite .",
    "thus the existence of stable ridges is formally a pure finite size effect .",
    "however , as will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : stationary ] , the limit of stability versus pearling at a given system size can correspond to a width of the ridge which is small with respect to the lateral extent of the system .",
    "hence there is a wide range of configurations for which the quantities relevant for the dynamics of the ridge are primarily determined by macroscopic quantities such as the excess cross - section @xmath12 , which do not depend on the system size .    within our approach the thin film around the liquid ridge plays an auxiliary role .",
    "it facilitates the mobility of the edges of the ridge , but contributes negligibly to the dynamics within an appropriately chosen range of configurations .    a body force aligned with the channel ( e.g. , gravity if the substrate is tilted as illustrated in fig .  [",
    "cap : setup ]  the component normal to the substrate can be neglected ) drives the liquid along the chemical stripe .",
    "our goal is to establish and discuss both analytically and numerically the conditions of linear stability of a driven flow in a homogeneously filled channel , in particular with respect to pearling .",
    "since liquid ridges with contact angles larger than @xmath0 are unstable even for pinned contact lines , we restrict our analysis to small contact angles using the thin film approximation @xcite .",
    "as will be shown below , the translational invariance of the base state effectively reduces the corresponding boundary value problem to a set of ordinary differential equations for the base state and to an eigenvalue problem for ordinary differential equations for the linear stability analysis .",
    "an analytical analysis is possible in the limit of large wavelengths of the pearling perturbation and without drive .    in the general case",
    ", we solve the equations numerically using the software auto2000 @xcite . within this numerical approach , instead of looking for a non - trivial solution in a complicated system , one starts with a simple configuration for which the solution is known . in the present case the latter is a flat wetting film on a homogeneous substrate . by gradually incrementing the system parameters towards non - trivial values , one is able to explore a domain of non - trivial solutions containing the simple starting point . in the present case ,",
    "the most important system parameters are the chemical contrast between the channel and the embedding substrate , the excess cross - section , drive , and the wavenumber of the perturbation . as for the explicit dependence of the substrate heterogeneity on the lateral",
    "coordinate @xmath3 , treating @xmath3 as a part of the solution vector renders the system autonomous as required by auto2000 .",
    "in the limit of small gradients ( i.e. , long wavelengths ) , the dynamics of a thin film of a newtonian , nonvolatile viscous liquid is well described by the standard thin film equation for the local film thickness @xmath6 ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in view of future purposes",
    ", we decompose it into a conservation equation ( [ eq : conservation ] ) , an expression ( [ eq : flow ] ) for the lateral flow @xmath13 , and an equation ( [ eq : pressure ] ) for the local pressure @xmath14 :    [ eq : thinfilm ] @xmath15\\,,\\label{eq : conservation}\\\\ \\tilde{\\mathbf{j}}\\left(x,\\tilde{h}\\right ) & = & -\\frac{q(\\tilde{h})}{\\eta}\\mathbf{\\nabla}\\left[\\tilde{p}(x,\\tilde{h})-\\rho gy\\right]\\,,\\label{eq : flow}\\\\ \\tilde{p}\\left(x,\\tilde{h}\\right ) & = & -\\pi(x,\\tilde{h})-\\sigma\\mathbf{\\nabla}^{2}\\tilde{h}\\,.\\label{eq : pressure}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the pressure in eq .",

    "@xcite and refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite for refined versions ) .",
    "however , the effective interface potential is an equilibrium concept and the dynamics in a wetting film a few molecular layers thick is certainly not given by hydrodynamical equations . in this sense the repulsive part of @xmath19 ( or @xmath20 ) serves the purpose of keeping the liquid film thickness nonzero even on the lyophobic substrate and thus allows the three phase contact line to move even in the absence of hydrodynamic slip at the liquid - substrate interface .",
    "moreover , as described below , the variation of the contact angle between the channel and the substrate is encoded in the @xmath3-dependence of @xmath20 .",
    "the third aspect taken care of by @xmath20 is to include the influence of long - ranged dispersion forces on the dynamics in the channel .",
    "thus we do not expect eq .",
    "( [ eq : thinfilm ] ) to be an accurate description of the microscopic dynamics near the contact line and in the wetting layer ; rather , it bears some conceptual similarities with a phase field equation ( a numerical method introduced in the context of crystal growth , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) for the three phase contact line . in particular , here it is not necessary to take the location of the edge into account explicitly .",
    "also , since we do not discuss wetting transitions within this model , we do not expect a strong dependence of our results on details of @xmath20 , in particular not on the precise form of its short - ranged repulsive part and of other subdominant terms .    the additional pressure term @xmath21 in eq .",

    "since the chemical heterogeneity of the substrate is symmetric with respect to @xmath27 and the driving force is aligned with the @xmath1 axis , the stationary configurations exhibit the same symmetry .    here",
