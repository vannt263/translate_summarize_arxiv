    "the considerable progress in thin film etching allows today the realization of almost any waveguide structure requiring submicron resolution . for example",
    ", the fabrication of single mode optical waveguides , couplers , interferometers or ring resonators is well controlled .",
    "whatever their function , these structures are made of a superposition of several thin layers and they have to guide light . therefore it is essential to accurately characterize the optical and geometrical properties of each layer of the stack .",
    "several techniques exist to perform such a characterization in the case of a single layer film , such as those based on the measurements of the reflection and transmission coefficients of the sample  @xcite , the ellipsometry  @xcite , and the m - lines spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "the case of multilayer waveguides has been much less investigated , although the assumption that a layer in a stack shows the same properties as it has when measured individually , can become wrong .",
    "the characterization of the whole structure then becomes necessary .",
    "some work was done on the case of two layers  @xcite ( sometimes denoted as a `` four layer film '' since the stack is deposited on a substrate and the air is considered as a top layer ) , however , no literature is available for three layer structures .",
    "these structures are of special interest since they consist of the minimum number of layers required in order to obtain a single mode waveguide which is thick enough to enable efficient coupling of the light . in this paper",
    "we will focus on three layer waveguides and show how the refractive indices and thicknesses of the individual layers can be retrieved simultaneously from m - lines spectroscopy measurements .    in classical m - lines devices ,",
    "the sample is pressed against a face of a prism .",
    "the prism and the film are mounted on a rotating stage in order to allow the variation of the light incidence angle .",
    "a thin air gap between the sample and the prism face is maintained whose thickness should be approximately the fourth of the light probe wavelength .",
    "the incoming light is refracted inside the prism and reaches the interface between the prism and the sample . since the refractive index of the prism is higher than that of the sample , the light is totally reflected at this interface , for a given range of incidence angles , and then emerges from the prism to be detected . for some angles , called `` synchronous angles '' ,",
    "however , part of the light is coupled into the waveguide , hence substracted from the detected light .",
    "therefore , a typical m - lines spectrum consists in several absorption - like peaks , centered around the synchronous angles . from the positions of the synchronous angles , it is possible to deduce the propagation constants of the guided modes of the sample under test and",
    "derive the optical and geometrical properties of the structure ( refractive index and thickness ) by solving the modal dispersion equations .",
    "the first part of this paper is devoted to the determination of the explicit form of modal dispersion equations of the three layer waveguide .",
    "we will then describe the numerical method used in order to solve these equations and present numerical tests that prove its accuracy .",
    "the validity of the method will be finally demonstrated experimentally by the analysis of m - lines spectra produced by three layer zno / pzt / zno waveguides .",
    "the studied structure is a stack of five transparent homogeneous layers shown on fig .  1 .",
    "the substrate ( layer  # 0 ) and the superstrate ( layer  # 5 ) are considered as semi - infinite since their thicknesses are several orders of magnitude greater than those of layers @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the light is confined only in these three central layers and presents an evanescent decay in the substrate and the superstrate .",
    "we call this structure a `` three layer waveguide '' , whereas in the nomenclature of other authors  @xcite it would be called a `` 5 layer waveguide ''",
    ". the central layer ( layer  # 2 ) is the core of the structure and the layers  # 1 and # 3 are the claddings ( true waveguide  @xcite ) . as a consequence ,",
    "we assume for the refractive indices of the different layers that : @xmath3    in the following , we will restrict ourselves to the case of te modes , the extension to the case of tm modes is straightforward .",
    "the only component of the electrical field of the te modes is along the ( oy ) axis , so the electric field in the layer j can be written as : @xmath4+b_j\\exp[i(-\\gamma_j x+\\beta_m z)]$ ] and the tangential component of the magnetic field is @xmath5 . in these expressions , @xmath6 is the angular frequency and @xmath7 is the propagation constant of the @xmath8 guided mode .",
    "it is usually written as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the wavevector modulus in vacuum and @xmath11 the effective index of the m@xmath12 mode . using the condensed notation @xmath13 ,",
    "the x component of the wavevector , @xmath14 , which gives the nature of the wave in the layer @xmath15 , becomes @xmath16 for a travelling wave and @xmath17 for an evanescent wave .",
    "a transfer matrix @xmath18 , which binds the electromagnetic fields at the backplane of the layer to the fields at its frontplane , can be associated to each layer  @xcite : @xmath19 the boundary conditions imply that the tangential components of the magnetic and electrical fields must be continuous at the interface of the layers .",
    "these conditions together with the condition for obtaining guiding lead to : @xmath20 which has solutions only for : @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the components of the matrix @xmath23 . with the definition  ( [ eq2 ] ) of the transfert matrix",
    ", this equation can be written as  @xcite : @xmath24 \\\\[8 mm ]   &    + \\;{\\rm arctan } \\left [   \\ !",

    "as stated above , the @xmath14 terms are either real or imaginary depending on the nature of the waves in the @xmath25 layer . as a consequence , an analysis in the complex plane is required in order to solve directly the equation  [ eq5 ] .",
    "it is better to take advantage of physical arguments to split the problem in several simpler ones . under the condition of eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] , three kinds of guided waves can exist :    * the lowest order modes can only propagate in the layer # 2 .",

    "if @xmath29 then the light is guided in the layers  # 2 and # 3 and eq .",

    "the corresponding modal dispersion equation is obtained by interverting the functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 in eq .",
    "* finally , highest order modes can propagate in the three layers .",
    "the dispersion equation for these modes is : @xmath33   \\\\[4 mm ]    \\quad    - \\;\\mathrm{arctan } \\left [ \\displaystyle \\ ! \\frac { \\displaystyle a_3\\,a_4 -   a_3 ^ 2\\,\\mathrm{tan}({a_{3}}\\,{d_{3 } } ) } { \\displaystyle a_2\\,a_3 + a_2\\,a_{4}\\ , \\mathrm{tan}({a_{3}}\\,{d_{3 } } ) }   \\ !",
    "\\right ]   -   \\;m \\,\\pi = 0 \\end{array}\\ ] ]",
    "at a first glance , the problem contains 6 unknown parameters which are the refractive indices and thicknesses of the layers # 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "however , depending on the guiding regime , one has to associate correctly the dispersion equation to each measured synchronous angle .",
    "consequently , further parameters have to be determined :    * @xmath34 , the order of the first measured mode .",
    "it is often equal to 0 , but the lower order modes are sometimes difficult to excite , and hence may be not visible in the m - lines spectrum .",
    "there is no evidence on the value of @xmath34 in practice .",
    "* @xmath28 , the order of the first mode guided by two layers .",
    "numerical simulations with noisy data showed that @xmath28 is the value of @xmath35 such that @xmath36 .",
    "this criterion results in a correct value of @xmath28 or with a mismatch of + 1  @xcite . in the following",
    "we will call @xmath37 the value given by this criterion .",
    "* @xmath38 , the order of the first mode guided by three layers . *",
    "finally , the modal dispersion equation in the case of two guiding layers is not the same according to whether @xmath39 is smaller or greater than @xmath40 .",
    "hence it is also necessary to make an initial hypothesis on the relative values of @xmath39 and @xmath40 and to verify this assumption during the resolution .",
    "the analysis of a m - lines spectrum thus requires a somewhat complicated algorithm . for clarity reasons",
    ", we splitted the presentation of this algorithm into two parts ( fig .  2 and  3 ) .",
    "the details of the `` resolution '' box of the full algorithm ( shown on fig .",
    "3 ) are presented in fig .  2 , aiming to solve a system of 6 equations in 6 unknowns for @xmath34 , @xmath28 , @xmath38 given and for an assumption on the relative values of @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "obviously , this problem can be solved only if the m - lines spectrum contains more than 6 modes .",
    "let us call @xmath23 the number of measured synchronous angles .",
    "there is @xmath41 combinations of 6 modes . for a given combination @xmath15",
    ", we firstly use a newton - raphson method to get a solution @xmath42 .",
    "then , we start from this solution and use a bissection algorithm to calculate the set of @xmath23 corresponding synchronous angles : @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "the validity of the solution is evaluated by the standard deviation of the differences between the values of the calculated synchronous angles and the measured ones : @xmath45 if @xmath46 is smaller than @xmath47 ( upper limit of experimental uncertainty ) , the solution is considered as correct .",
    "this procedure is used for the @xmath41 combinations but it does not find roots in all cases .",
    "let us call @xmath48 the number of combinations for which the procedure succeeds .",
    "the solution we finally retain is the mean value of these @xmath48 solutions and we associate a fitness @xmath49 to this solution defined by : @xmath50 @xmath51 was used rather than @xmath48 , in order to give more weight to the configurations which lead to a high number of acceptable solutions .",
    "the parameters @xmath34 , @xmath28 , and @xmath38 are obtained with an iterative procedure schematized on fig .",
    "we start with the @xmath23 measured synchronous angles and under the hypothesis @xmath52 .",
    "the value of @xmath28 is set to @xmath37 , @xmath34 to 0 and @xmath38 to @xmath28 and the procedure of resolution described above is used in order to get a solution and its associated fitness @xmath53 .",
    "this procedure is repeated with firstly an incrementation of @xmath38 from @xmath28 to @xmath23 , secondly an incrementation of @xmath34 from 0 to 5 ( which in general is sufficient ) and thirdly by setting @xmath28 to @xmath54 . for the case where no solution was obtained at the end of these iterations",
    ", the whole procedure is repeated with the opposite hypothesis ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the refractive indices and thicknesses finally selected are those which are associated to the lowest value of @xmath49 thus defining the values @xmath34 , @xmath28 , @xmath38 and @xmath56 .",
    "the validity of the method was verified by numerical simulations .",
    "starting from a theoretical waveguide defined by the parameters @xmath57 , we calculated the corresponding set of synchronous angles @xmath58 . in order to test the sensitivity to the noise",

    "the values of @xmath63 used in the simulations were chosen in order to correspond to the experimentally observed noise .",
    "the hundred noisy data sets were analysed , giving rise to a number @xmath64 of sets of solutions @xmath65 .",

    "each value @xmath68 of the parameter @xmath69 ( @xmath70 or @xmath71 ) differed from the theoretical value @xmath72 .",
    "the distribution of errors @xmath73 followed a normal law for all parameters @xmath69 and all noises  @xcite , as showed on fig .  4 for the example of @xmath74 . finally , we defined the uncertainty @xmath75 on the parameter @xmath69 as three times the standard deviation of the distribution , in order to be in the confidence interval of 99% : @xmath76^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "a total of eight thousands waveguides were simulated , whose characteristics are summarized in tab .",
    "the thickness of the upper layer , @xmath71 , was constant and smaller than the penetration depth of the light , in order to make possible the evanescent coupling between the prism and the central layer .",
    ".range of parameters explored with the statistical study . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab2 ]",
    "in this paper , the general modal dispersion equation for a three layer planar waveguide is shown , from which the modal dispersion equations that hold for different guiding regimes are derived . a method to solve these equations",
    "is proposed , where the input data are the synchronous angles measured by m - lines spectroscopy .",
    "monte carlo simulations show that the values of the refractives indices and the thicknesses of the central layer given by this method are as accurate as those obtained for a single layer .",
    "the accuracy is not so good for the upper layer , however , the error remains smaller than 2.10@xmath77 for the index and below 30  nm for the thickness when the uncertainty on the measured angles remains smaller than 0.1@xmath78 .",
    "the method was applied to the characterization of real three layer planar waveguide structures made of one pzt layer embedded between two zno cladding layers deposited on glass substrate .",
    "the agreement between the results obtained with three layer structures and those obtained with two layer structures ensures the validity of our method .",
    "moreover , the three layer analysis revealed changes in material properties , such as increasing of the refractive index of pzt deposited on zno in comparison to deposition on glass and increasing of the refractive index of zno deposited on pzt in comparison to deposition on glass .",
    "the proposed method allows to simultaneously characterize the optical and geometrical properties of each layer of three layer waveguides .",
    "consequently , it is a very interesting instrument in order to verify whether the three layer structures are matching the parameters defined during the design process of waveguide ."
