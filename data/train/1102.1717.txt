    "studying the topology of moduli spaces in algebraic geometry could be considered the first approximation of understanding the moduli problem .",
    "we start with an example which is one of the original examples of moduli spaces constructed by mumford @xcite in 1962 using geometric invariant theory .",
    "let @xmath3 denote the moduli space of semi - stable rank @xmath0 degree @xmath1 stable bundles on a smooth complex algebraic curve @xmath2 ; which turns out to be a projective variety . in 1965",
    "narasimhan and seshadri @xcite proved that the space @xmath4 is canonically diffeomorphic with the manifold @xmath5\\dots [ a_g , b_g ] = \\zeta_n^d i \\}/{\\rm u}(n),\\ ] ] of twisted representations of the fundamental group of @xmath2 to @xmath6 , where @xmath7 .",
    "newstead @xcite in 1966 used this latter description to determine the betti numbers of @xmath8 when @xmath9 and @xmath10 . using ideas from algebraic number theory for function fields harder @xcite in 1970 counted the rational points @xmath11 over a finite field when @xmath9 and @xmath10 and compared his formulae to newstead s results to find that the analogue of the riemann hypothesis , the last remaining weil conjectures , holds in this case . by the time harder and narasimhan @xcite in 1975 managed to count @xmath12 for any @xmath0 and coprime @xmath1 the last of the weil conjectures had been proved by deligne @xcite in 1974 , and their result in turn yielded @xcite recursive formulae for the betti numbers of @xmath13 .",
    "the same recursive formulae were found using a completely different method by atiyah and bott @xcite in 1981 .",
    "they studied the topology of @xmath3 in another reincarnation with origins in theoretical physics .",
    "the yang - mills equations on @xmath14 appeared in theoretical physics as certain non - abelian generalization to maxwell s equation ; and were used to describe aspects of the standard model of the physics of elementary particles .",
    "atiyah and bott considered the analogue of these equations in 2 dimensions , more precisely the solution space @xmath15 of yang - mills connections on a differentiable hermitian vector bundle of rank @xmath0 and degree @xmath1 on the riemann surface @xmath2 modulo gauge transformations .",
    "once again we have canonical diffeomorphisms @xmath16 .",
    "bott @xcite used this gauge theoretical approach to study the topology of @xmath17 obtaining in particular recursive formulae for the betti numbers which turned out to be essentially the same as those arising from harder - narasimhan s arithmetic approach .",
    "atiyah - bott s approach has been greatly generalized in kirwan s work @xcite to study the cohomology of khler quotients in differential geometry and the closely related git quotients in algebraic geometry .",
    "by now we have a fairly comprehensive understanding of the cohomology ( besides betti numbers : the ring structure , torsion , k - theory etc ) of @xmath4 or more generally of compact khler and git quotients .    in this survey",
    "we will be interested in a hyperkhler analogue of the above questions .",
    "it started with hitchin s seminal paper @xcite in 1987 .",
    "hitchin @xcite investigated the two - dimensional reduction of the four dimensional yang - mills equations over a riemann surface , what we now call hitchin s self - duality equations on a rank @xmath0 and degree @xmath1 bundle on the riemann surface @xmath2 . using gauge theoretical methods one can construct @xmath18 the space of solutions to hitchin s self - duality equations modulo gauge transformations .",
    "@xmath18 can be considered as the hyperkhler analogue of @xmath15 .",
    "when @xmath0 and @xmath1 are coprime @xmath18 is a smooth , albeit non - compact , differentiable manifold with a natural hyperkhler metric .",
    "the latter means a metric with three khler forms corresponding to complex structures @xmath19 and @xmath20 , satisfiying quaternionic relations .",
    "hitchin @xcite found that the corresponding algebraic geometric moduli space is the moduli space @xmath21 of semi - stable higgs bundles @xmath22 of rank @xmath0 and degree @xmath1 and again we have the natural diffeomorphism @xmath23 which in fact is complex analytical in the complex structure @xmath24 of the hyperkhler metric on @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 is the hyperkhler analogue of @xmath4 .",
    "using a natural morse function on @xmath18 hitchin was able to determine the betti numbers of @xmath18 when @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and this work was extended by gothen @xcite in 1994 to the @xmath27 case . hitherto the betti numbers for @xmath28 have not been found , but see  [ conclusion ] .",
    "in this paper we will survey several approaches to get cohomological information on @xmath18 .",
    "the main difficulty lies in the fact that @xmath18 is non - compact .",
    "however as hitchin @xcite says .2 cm `` ... the moduli space of all solutions turns out to be a manifold with an extremely rich geometric structure '' .",
    ".2 cm due to this surprisingly rich geometrical structures on @xmath18 we will have several different approaches to study @xmath29 , some motivated by ideas in theoretical physics , some by arithmetic and some by langlands duality .",
    "as mentioned @xmath18 has a natural hyperkhler metric and in complex structure @xmath30 it turns out to be complex analytically isomorphic to the character variety @xmath31\\dots [ a_g , b_g ] = \\zeta_n^d i \\left . \\right\\}/\\!/\\gl_n(\\c)\\ ] ] of twisted representations of the fundamental group of @xmath2 to @xmath32 .",
    "the new phenomenon here is that this is a complex variety .",
    "thus cohomological information could be gained by counting points of it over finite fields . using the character table of the finite group @xmath33 of lie type",
    "this was accomplished in @xcite .",
    "the calculation leads to some interesting conjectures on the betti numbers of @xmath34 .",
    "this approach was surveyed in @xcite .",
    "we will also mention this approach in ",
    "[ betti ] but here will focus on its connections to one more aspect of the geometry of @xmath18 .",
    "namely , that it carries the structure of an integrable system .    this integrable system , called the hitchin system , was defined in @xcite by taking the characteristic polynomial of the higgs field , and has several remarkable properties .",
    "first of all it is a completely integrable system with respect to the holomorphic symplectic structure on @xmath26 arising from the hyperkhler metric .",
    "second it is proper , in particular the generic fibers are abelian varieties . in this paper",
    "we will concentrate on the topological aspects of the hitchin system on @xmath26 .",
    "the recent renewed interest in the hitchin system could be traced back to two major advances .",
    "one is kapustin - witten s @xcite proposal in 2006 , that s - duality gives a physical framework for the geometric langlands correspondence .",
    "in fact , @xcite argues that this s - duality reduces to mirror symmetry for hitchin systems for langlands dual groups .",
    "this point of view has been expanded and explained in several papers such as @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "one of our main motivation to study @xmath35 is to try to prove the topological mirror symmetry proposal of @xcite , which is a certain agreement of hodge numbers of the mirror hitchin systems ; which we now understand as a cohomological shadow of kapustin - witten s s - duality ( see  [ solving].[shadow ] ) .",
    "this topological mirror symmetry proposal is mathematically well - defined and could be tested by using the existing techniques of studying the cohomology of @xmath35 . indeed it is a theorem when @xmath36 using @xcite and @xcite . below we will introduce the necessary formalism to discuss these conjectures and results .",
    "most recently ng proved @xcite the fundamental lemma in the langlands program in 2008 by a detailed study of the topology of the hitchin map over a large open subset of its image .",
    "surprisingly , ng s geometric approach will be intimately related to our considerations , even though ng s main application is the study of the cohomology of a _ singular fiber _ of the hitchin map .",
    "we will explain at the end of this survey some connections of ng s work to our studies of the global topology of the hitchin map .",
    "we should also mention that both kapustin - witten and ng study hitchin systems for general reductive groups , for simplicity we will concentrate on the groups @xmath37 and @xmath38 in this paper .",
    "our studies will lead us into a circle of ideas relating arithmetic and the langlands program to the physical ideas from gauge theory , s - duality and mirror symmetry in the study of the global topology of the hitchin system .",
    "this could be considered the hyperkhler analogue of the fascinating parallels between the arithmetic approach of harder  narasimhan and the gauge theoretical approach of atiyah  bott in the study of @xmath39 .",
    ".2 cm    * acknowledgement * the basis of this survey are the notes taken by gergely brczi , michael grchenig and geordie williamson from a preparatory lecture course `` mirror symmetry , langlands duality and the hitchin system '' the author gave in oxford in hilary term 2010 .",
    "i would like to thank them and the organizers of several lecture courses where various subsets of these notes were delivered in 2010 .",
    "these include the spring school on `` geometric langlands and gauge theory '' at crm barcelona , a lecture series at the geometry and quantum field theory cluster at the university of amsterdam , the `` summer school on the hitchin fibration '' at the university of bonn and the simons lecture series at stony brook .",
    "i would also like to thank mark de cataldo , iain gordon , jochen heinloth , daniel huybrechts , luca migliorini , david nadler , tony pantev and especially an anonymous referee for helpful comments .",
    "the author was supported by a royal society university research fellowship .      in order to motivate the topological mirror symmetry conjectures of @xcite , we give some background information on three of the main topics involved starting with mirror symmetry .",
    "considerations of mirror symmetry appeared in various forms in string theory at the end of the 1980 s .",
    "it entered into the realm of mathematics via the work @xcite of candelas - de la ossa - green - parkes in 1991 by formulating mathematically precise ( and surprising ) conjectures on the number of rational curves in certain calabi - yau 3-folds .",
    "mathematically , mirror symmetry relates the symplectic geometry of a calabi - yau manifold @xmath40 to the complex geometry of its mirror calabi - yau @xmath41 of the same dimension .",
    "such an unexpected duality between two previously separately studied fields in geometry has caught the interest of several mathematicians working in related fields .",
    "the literature of mirror symmetry is vast , here we only mention monographs and conference proceedings on the subject such as @xcite .",
    "first aspect of checking a mirror symmetry proposal is the _ topological mirror test _ h^p , q(x)=h^y - p , q(y)that the hodge diamonds have to be mirror to each other . if we introduce the notation @xmath42 the symmetry translates to e(x;x , y)=x^y e(y;1/x , y).as we will be interested in the case when the calabi - yau manifolds are hyperkhler we note that a _ compact _",
    "hyperkhler manifold @xmath40 satisfies @xmath43 and so the above topological mirror test simplifies to the agreement h^p , q(x)=h^p , q(y)of hodge numbers when both @xmath40 and @xmath41 are hyperkhler .",
    "kontsevich @xcite in 1994 suggested that mirror symmetry is underlined by a more fundamental _",
    "homological mirror symmetry _ , which identifies two derived categories @xmath44 the fukaya category @xmath45 of certain decorated lagrangian subvarieties of the symplectic manifold @xmath46 and the derived category of coherent sheaves @xmath47 on the mirror @xmath41 , considered as a complex variety .",
    "this suggestion has been checked in several examples @xcite and has been the starting point of a large body of mathematical research .    a more geometrical proposal is contained in the work of strominger - yau - zaslow @xcite in 1996 .",
    "they suggested a geometrical construction how to obtain the mirror @xmath41 from any given calabi - yau @xmath40 .",
    "it suggested that @xmath41 can be constructed as the moduli space of certain special lagrangian submanifolds of @xmath40 together with a flat line bundle on it ; the picture arising then can be described as    @xmath48_{{\\chi}_x } & & y \\ar[dl]^{{\\chi}_y } \\\\          & b          } \\ ] ] where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are special lagrangian fibrations on @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively , with generic fibers dual middle - dimensional tori .",
    "until this @xcite proposal there was no general geometrical conjectures how one might construct @xmath41 from @xmath40 . even though there have been a fair amount of work today we do not have an example where the geometrical proposal of @xcite is completely implemented for the original case of calabi - yau @xmath51-folds . but see @xcite for a survey of recent developments .",
    "we conclude by noting that many mathematical predictions of mirror symmetry have been confirmed but we still have no general understanding yet .      here",
    "we give some technically simplified remarks as a sketch of a basic introduction to a few ideas in the langlands program in number theory ; more details and references can be found in the surveys @xcite .    as a first approximation",
    ", the langlands correspondence aims to describe a central object in number theory : the absolute galois group @xmath52 via representation theory .",
    "more precisely let @xmath53 be a reductive group ( over the complex numbers these are just the complexifications of compact lie groups ) and @xmath54 its langlands dual , which one can obtain by dualizing the root datum of @xmath53 .",
    "for example for the groups of our concern in the present paper : @xmath55 ; @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "langlands in 1967 conjectured that one can find a correspondence between the set isomorphism classes of certain continuous homomorphisms @xmath58 ( for @xmath59 these are just @xmath0-dimensional representations ) and automorphic ( certain infinite dimensional ) representations of @xmath60 over the ring of adles @xmath61 .",
    "the motivation for understanding the representations of @xmath52 is that it describes the absolute galois group itself via the tannakian formalism .",
    "langlands built his programme as a non - abelian generalization of the adlic description of class field theory which can be understood as the @xmath62 case of the above .",
    "indeed representations of @xmath52 to @xmath63 describe the abelianization @xmath64 which describes all finite abelian extensions of @xmath65 . in the case of @xmath66 elliptic curves enter naturally , via the action of the absolute galois group on their two - dimensional first tale cohomology .",
    "the corresponding objects on the automorphic side are modular forms , and the langlands program in this case can be seen to reduce to the shimura - taniyama - weil conjecture which is now a theorem due to the work of wiles and others .",
    "the adlic description of class field theory was partly motivated by the deep analogy between @xmath65 , or more generally number fields ( i.e. finite extensions of the rationals ) , and the function field @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is an algebraic curve .",
    "this analogy proved powerful in attacking problems in algebraic number theory and in the langlands program specifically .",
    "many of the conjectured properties of number fields can be formulated for function fields , where one can use the techniques of algebraic geometry and succeed even in situations where the number field case remains open .",
    "such an example is the riemann hypothesis , which is still open over @xmath65 , but was proved over function fields @xmath67 of curves by weil @xcite in 1941 and for any algebraic variety by deligne @xcite in 1974 .",
    "for an example of the more harmonious interaction between the number field and function field side of algebraic number theory we mention that ng s recent proof @xcite of the fundamental lemma for @xmath67 ( where he used the topology of the hitchin system , for more details see  [ solving].[tmstofl ] ) yielded the fundamental lemma for the number field case , due to previous work by waldspurger @xcite .",
    "if we replace @xmath69 by @xmath70 , i.e. consider the complex function field @xmath71 for complex curves @xmath72 , i.e. riemann surfaces , then we lose some of the analogies , but still one can reformulate a version of the langlands correspondence mentioned above .",
    "this is the _ geometric langlands correspondence _ as was proposed by @xcite .",
    "originally it was a correspondence between isomorphism classes of @xmath53-local systems on @xmath2 ( analogues of the representations of the absolute galois group ) and certain hecke eigensheaves ( the analogues of automorphic representations ) on the stack @xmath73 of @xmath54-bundles on @xmath40 .",
    "in these lectures our point of view will be that as a cohomological shadow of these considerations of the geometric langlands programme one can extract agreements of certain hodge numbers of hitchin systems for langlands dual groups .",
    "here we collect some of the basic ideas of completely integrable hamiltonian systems and comment on the history of a large class of them : the hitchin systems .",
    "an extensive account for the former can be found in @xcite while @xcite details the latter .",
    "recall that a hamiltonian system is given by a symplectic manifold @xmath74 and a hamiltonian - or energy- function @xmath75 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath76 hamiltonian vector field is defined by the property @xmath77 the dynamics of the hamiltonian system is given by the flow - the one parameter group of diffeomorphisms - generated by @xmath76 .",
    "a function @xmath78 is called a _ first integral _ if @xmath79 holds .",
    "the condition is equivalent to say that @xmath80 is constant along the flow of the system .",
    "note that @xmath81 as @xmath82 is alternating and so @xmath83 is constant along the flow - which is sometimes referred to as the law of conservation of energy .",
    "we say that the hamiltonian system is _ completely integrable _ if there is a map @xmath84 which is generic ( meaning that @xmath80 is generically a submersion ) such that @xmath85 .",
    "the generic fibre of @xmath80 then has an action of @xmath86 and so when @xmath80 is proper the generic fibre can be identified with a torus @xmath87 . in such cases",
    "one has a fairly good control of the dynamics of the system ( on the generic fiber it is just an affine motion ) hence the name integrable .",
    "several examples arise in classical mechanics such as the euler and kovalevskaya tops and the spherical pendulum . for more details",
    "see @xcite .    here",
    "we will be concerned with the complexified or algebraic version of integrable hamiltonian systems .",
    "thus we consider a complex @xmath88 dimensional manifold @xmath40 with a holomorphic symplectic @xmath89-form .",
    "@xmath90 now is a algebraically completely integrable system when @xmath80 is generically a submersion and @xmath85 .",
    "if @xmath80 turns out to be proper , the generic fiber then will become a torus with a complex structure - in the algebraic case- an abelian variety .",
    "this is the case for a large class of examples : the _ hitchin systems_. as we will see in more detail below the hitchin system is attached to the cotangent bundle of the moduli space of stable @xmath53-bundles on a complex curve @xmath40 .",
    "originally it appeared in hitchin s study @xcite of the 2-dimensional reduction of the yang - mills equations from @xmath91-dimensions . here",
    "we will follow a more algebraic approach .",
    "let @xmath2 be a complex projective curve of genus @xmath92 .",
    "we fix integers @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "we asssume throughout that @xmath95 .",
    "using geometric invariant theory @xcite one can construct @xmath96 ; the moduli space of isomorphism classes of stable rank @xmath0 degree @xmath1 vector bundles ( equivalently @xmath32-bundles ) on @xmath2 .",
    "we recall that a vector bundle is called _ semistable _ if every subbundle @xmath97 satisfies @xmath98 a vector bundle is _ stable _ if one has strict inequality above for all proper subbundles .",
    "in general one has to be careful in constructing such moduli spaces as special care has to be taken for the non - trivial automorphisms of strictly semi - stable objects .",
    "however , as we assume @xmath95 the notions of semi - stability and stability clearly agree .",
    "in particular , we can conclude that @xmath99 is smooth and projective of dimension @xmath100 .",
    "consider the determinant morphism @xmath101 which sends a vector bundle of rank @xmath0 to its highest exterior power @xmath102 . choose @xmath103 and define @xmath104 .",
    "when @xmath105 is the trivial bundle , the vector bundles in @xmath106 are exactly the @xmath107-bundles , for general @xmath108 we can think of points in @xmath106 as `` twisted @xmath107-bundles '' . tensoring with an @xmath0th root of @xmath109 gives an isomoprhism @xmath110 thus the isomorphism class of @xmath106 does not depend on the choice of @xmath103 .",
    "we often abuse notation and write @xmath111 instead of @xmath106 .",
    "the abelian variety @xmath112 acts on @xmath99 via @xmath113 as seshadri showed in @xcite the quotient of a normal variety by an abelian variety always exist , so we can define the moduli space of degree @xmath1 @xmath38 bundles : @xmath114 the embedding @xmath115 induces @xmath116 here @xmath117 $ ] is the group of @xmath0-torsion points of the jacobian , isomorphic to the finite group @xmath118 .",
    "it acts on @xmath106 by tensorization .",
    "hence @xmath119 is a projective orbifold .",
    "the cohomology of @xmath99 , @xmath111 and @xmath119 is well understood .",
    "the structure of the cohomology rings can be described by finding universal generators and all the relations between them @xcite .",
    "here we only comment on the additive structure in more detail . in 1975",
    "harder and narasimhan @xcite obtained recursive formulae for the number of points of these varieties over finite fields .",
    "it is then possible to use the weil conjectures ( which had been proven the year before by deligne @xcite ) to obtain formulae for the betti numbers . in 1981 atiyah and bott gave a different gauge - theoretic proof @xcite .",
    "the main application in harder and narasimhan s paper is the following :    [ harnar ] the finite group @xmath120 acts trivially on @xmath121 .",
    "in particular , we have @xmath122 .",
    "this result is difficult to prove and relies on showing that the varieties @xmath111 and @xmath119 have the same number of points over finite fields .",
    "the analogue of this result is false in the context of the moduli space of higgs bundles as was already observed by hitchin in @xcite for @xmath9 .",
    "interestingly for us , this will lead to the non - triviality of our topological mirror tests .",
    "we now consider the hitchin system , which will be an integrable system on the cotangent bundle to the moduli spaces considered in the previous section . as in the previous section , fix @xmath0 and @xmath1 and abbreviate @xmath123 .",
    "the cotangent bundle @xmath124 is an algebraic variety .",
    "the ring of regular functions @xmath125 $ ] turns out to be finitely - generated as will be proven below .",
    "the _ hitchin map _ then is simply the affinization : : t^ * = ( [ t^ * ] ) .",
    "we now describe this map more explicitly . for a point @xmath126 \\in \\mathcal{n}$ ] standard deformation theory",
    "gives us an identification @xmath127}\\mathcal{n } = h^1(c , \\operatorname{end}(e)).\\ ] ] applying serre duality we obtain @xmath127}^*\\mathcal{n } = h^0(c , \\operatorname{end}(e ) \\otimes k),\\ ] ] where @xmath20 denotes the canonical bundle of @xmath2 .",
    "an element @xmath128 is called a _",
    "higgs field_. morally , it can be thought of as a matrix of one - forms on the curve . as such",
    "if we consider the characteristic polynomial of @xmath129 then it will have the form @xmath130 where @xmath131 .",
    "for example @xmath132 is the determinant of the higgs field .",
    "as we will prove below the hitchin map then has the explicit description @xmath133 the affine space @xmath134 is called the _ hitchin base_.    in the @xmath107-case we have @xmath127}^*\\check{\\mathcal{n}}^{d } = h^0(\\operatorname{end}_0(e ) \\otimes k)\\ ] ] that is , a covector at @xmath135 is given by a _ trace free _",
    "higgs field .",
    "thus in this case the hitchin base is @xmath136 and the hitchin map : t^*^d^0 .",
    "as the characteristic polynomial of the higgs field does not change when the higgs bundle is tensored with a line bundle , the action of @xmath137 on @xmath138 is along the fibers of @xmath139 and so @xmath139 descends to the quotient which gives the @xmath38 hitchin map : @xmath140    recall that @xmath141 is an algebraic symplectic variety with the canonical liouville symplectic form .    if @xmath142 , @xmath143 $ ] are two coordinate functions , then they poisson commute , i.e. @xmath144 .",
    "we have @xmath145 and the generic fibres of @xmath146 are open subsets of abelian varieties .",
    "therefore we have an algebraically completely integrable hamiltonian system .    as a next step we will projectivize the hitchin map @xmath147 .",
    "recall that a complex point in @xmath148 is given by a pair @xmath22 . in order to projectivize",
    "we need to allow @xmath135 to become unstable .",
    "a _ higgs bundle _ is a pair @xmath22 where @xmath135 is a vector bundle and @xmath149 is a higgs field .",
    "the definition for semi - stability and stability for higgs - bundles is almost the same as for vector bundles except we only consider @xmath150-invariant subbundles .",
    "the moduli - space of semi - stable higgs bundles is denoted by @xmath151 and often abbreviated as @xmath152 or even @xmath153 .",
    "it is a non - singular quasi - projective variety , having @xmath124 as an open subvariety .",
    "it is straightforward to extend @xmath154 .",
    "the following result shows that we have succeeded in projectivizing the hitchin map :    [ proper ] @xmath146 is a proper algebraically completely integrable hamiltonian system .",
    "its generic fibres are abelian varieties .",
    "note that @xmath155 is open dense with complement of codimension greater than @xmath156 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 6.1.iv ) .",
    "thus @xmath157\\cong \\c[\\mathcal{m}]$ ] .",
    "therefore the affinization of @xmath158 ( which must be the hitchin map as it is proper to an affine space ) restricts to the affinization of @xmath159 , which justifies our unorthodox introduction of the hitchin map above .",
    "it is straightforward now to compactify the @xmath107-hitchin map @xmath160 .",
    "we consider @xmath161 the moduli space of isomorphism classes of semi - stable higgs bundle @xmath22 of rank @xmath0 , @xmath162 and trace - free @xmath163 higgs field . again",
    "the isomorphism class of @xmath161 only depends on @xmath1 , so we will simplify our notation to @xmath164 , @xmath165 or even @xmath166 for the @xmath107 higgs moduli space .    as in the @xmath32-case the hitchin map @xmath167",
    "is given by the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial , it is proper and a completely integrable system .",
    "we also have that @xmath168 open and dense .",
    "let us recall the two constructions of the moduli space of @xmath38-higgs bundles .",
    "the cotangent bundle @xmath169 is a group .",
    "it acts on @xmath170 by @xmath171 this induces an action of @xmath172 $ ] on @xmath173 .",
    "then we may either define the @xmath38-moduli space as @xmath174 or equivalently as the orbifold @xmath175 the second quotient tells us that we obtain an orbifold . since @xmath176 is compatible with the @xmath120 action , we obtain a well - defined proper hitchin map @xmath177    all the three hitchin maps @xmath146 , @xmath139 and @xmath178 we defined above are proper algebraically completely integrable systems , therefore as explained in  [ intro].[integrablesystem ] we should expect the generic fibers to become compact tori , and as we are in the algebraic situation : abelian varieties .",
    "we will see below  [ higgs].[genericfibers ] that this is indeed the case .",
    "compared to the moduli spaces of bundles @xmath4 we have less information on the cohomology of @xmath153 .",

    "originally they define it using the bbdg - decomposition theorem of @xmath521 into perverse sheaves . but in @xcite they prove a more elementary equivalent definition in the case when @xmath41 is additionally affine .",

    "the proof of theorem  [ p = w ] was accomplished by a careful study of the topology of the hitchin map , which paralleled special cases of results of ng in his proof @xcite of the fundamental lemma .",
    "additionally we had to use all the previously established results @xcite on the cohomology of these @xmath9 varieties .",
    "interestingly for the proof for @xmath534 we had to use results which were discussed here for the topological mirror symmetry presented in  [ higgs].[n=2tmsdol ] and  [ betti].[caseb ] in this paper",
    ". we will now explain why this connection to mirror symmetry is not surprising .",
    "we define the perverse serre polynomial as @xmath535 and the @xmath352-twisted stringy perverse serre polynomial as @xmath536 by definition [ epoly ] and theorem [ dr = dol ] we have pe(_;u , v,1)=e(_;u , v)=e(_dr;u , v ) .",

    "note that although the original hodge numbers of @xmath26 did not possess any non - trivial symmetry , this refined version with the perverse filtration does .",
    "so in fact with this definition we can write down our most general form of the topological mirror symmetry conjectures .",
    "[ tms ] @xmath537    this most general form of our topological mirror symmetry conjecture solves the two problems we encountered before .",

    "thus conjecture  [ tms ] is a common generalization of conjectures [ drtms ] , [ doltms ] and [ btms ] .",
    "second , relative hard lefschetz endows the perverse hodge numbers with the symmetry , and so one can formulate topological mirror symmetry as in conjecture  [ tms ] . on the level of hodge numbers this conjecture takes the form : h^i ,",
    "j_p(_^d)=h^i+(-p)/2,j+(-p)/2_st,(_^e,^d),where @xmath538 is the opposite perversity , the hodge numbers are defined as @xmath539 and similarly for the stringy extension on the right hand side .",
    "this form is now more reminiscent of the original topological mirror symmetry .",
    "one can also compare the functional equation forms and conjecture  [ tms ] .",
    "the last ingredient which is missing to completely justify our topological mirror symmetry conjectures is to show that indeed these are cohomological shadows of the s - duality in the work of kapustin - witten @xcite .",
    "such an argument will be sketched in the next section .",
    "recall that kapustin and witten @xcite suggest that the geometrical langlands program is s - duality reduced to @xmath89 dimensions .",
    "this simplifies to @xmath540-duality , as first suggested by @xcite . in turn by the syz proposal",
    "we get to mirror symmetry between @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "now kontsevich s @xcite homological mirror symmetry conjecture implies that ^b(coh(_))~^b(fuk ( _ ) ) the derived category of coherent sheaves on @xmath187 is equivalent with a certain fukaya category on @xmath188 .",
    "this latter is not straightforward to define but recent work of nadler - zaslow @xcite relates a certain fukaya category of @xmath541 and a category of @xmath254-modules on @xmath40 , for a compact real analytical manifold @xmath40 .",
    "thus we may imagine that this result might extend to give an equivalence of the right hand side of with some category of @xmath254-modules on the stack @xmath542 of @xmath38 bundles on @xmath2 .",
    "the mathematical content of @xcite maybe phrased that the combination of this latter nadler - zaslow type equivalence with the homological mirror symmetry in leads to the proposed geometric langlands program of @xcite .",
    "as explained in @xcite in a certain semi - classical limit should become @xmath543 an equivalence of the derived categories of sheaves on hitchin systems for langlands dual groups . by recent work of arinkin",
    "@xcite it is expected that there is a geometrical fibrewise fourier - mukai transform at least for integral spectral curves .",
    "it means that there should be a poincar bundle @xmath544 on the fibered product @xmath545 such that the associated fiberwise fourier - mukai transform would identify = _ * ( ^*):^b(coh(_))^b(coh ( _ ) ) .",
    "one can argue that the cohomological shadow of such a fourier - mukai transform for orbifolds should be defined in stringy cohomology .",
    "also if one twists the above fourier - mukai transform by adding gerbes , as discussed e.g. in @xcite , then we should see stringy cohomology twisted with gerbes . also we should expect the cohomological shadow of to be compatible with the perverse filtration .",
    "all in all , the cohomological shadow of should identify s : h_p^r , s(^d_)h_st,^r+(-p)/2,s+(-p)/2(^e_;^d).in fact , this statement over the regular locus @xmath546 can be proved .",
    "moreover comparing supports of over @xmath547 or also by a fourier transform argument on @xmath120 one can deduce the refined version of .",

    "this way we can argue that the cohomological shadow of s - duality reduced to @xmath89-dimensions and in the semi - classical limit should yield our topological mirror symmetry conjecture  [ tms ] : @xmath549    more delicate structures of the kapustin  witten reduced s - duality @xcite have been mathematically implemented in recent works of yun @xcite , where ng s techniques from @xcite were havily used .",
    "finally , in the last section , we explain a connection between our topological mirror symmetry conjectures and ng s work @xcite on the fundamental lemma in the langlands program .",
    "ng s celebrated proof @xcite of the fundamental lemma is the culmination of a series of geometrical advances in the understanding of orbital integrals including @xcite .",
    "the proof proceeds by studying the hitchin fibration over the so - called elliptic locus . in the case of @xmath107 , which we will be only discussing here , this means the locus @xmath550 containg characteristics @xmath551 so that the corresponding spectral curve @xmath201 is integral , i.e. irreducible and reduced .",
    "in particular , it contains the locus we studied in this survey @xmath552 where @xmath201 is smooth .",
    "he considers the degree @xmath266 hitchin fibration @xmath553 over the elliptic locus .",
    "an important ingredient in ng s proof is the bbdg decomposition theorem of the derived push forward @xmath554 of the constant sheaf on @xmath555 into perverse sheaves .",
    "he proves the so - called _ support theorem _ , that in certain cases , including the hitchin fibration , the perverse components of @xmath554 are determined by a relatively small open subset of @xmath556 .",
    "the proof then is achieved by checking the geometrical formula below over this small open subset of @xmath556 ; yielding the statement over the whole @xmath556 .",
    "an important further geometrical insight of the paper @xcite is that @xmath554 should be understood with respect to a certain symmetry of the hitchin fibration , which we already studied in  [ basic].[symmetries ] over @xmath552 . similarly to our definition of the prym variety @xmath273 for a smooth spectral curve @xmath201 in , we can define the norm map @xmath557 and prym variety @xmath558 for an integral spectral curve @xmath218 as well .",
    "again similarly to the smooth case one can construct an action of @xmath273 on @xmath559 when @xmath560 . this way we get an action of the group scheme @xmath561 on @xmath562 .",
    "this symmetry of the hitchin fibration will induce an action of @xmath561 on @xmath554 .",
    "as the group scheme @xmath563 , the connected component of the identity in @xmath561 , acts trivially on cohomology ; this action of @xmath561 on @xmath554 will factor through an action of the group scheme of components @xmath564 .",
