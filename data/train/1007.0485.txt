    "the mystery of the observed baryon - antibaryon asymmetry [ 1 , 2 ] of the universe has not yet been unambiguously resolved .",
    "a study of baryogenesis usually has to incorporate sakharov s three criteria [ 3 ] : ( i ) baryon number violation , ( ii ) c and cp violation , ( iii ) departure from thermal equilibrium .",
    "the first two conditions are needed to create the matter - antimatter asymmetry and the third one is necessary to retain that asymmetry , or , in other words , to prevent the erasure of that asymmetry . in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics ,",
    "large baryon number violation is possible at high temperature by sphaleron transitions [ 4 - 9 ] between the degenerate vacua of the su(2 ) gauge field .",
    "thus , the first criterion of sakharov is met in the sm .",
    "however , it is difficult to satisfy the second and the third criteria in the sm as , in this model , the cp violation is too low to explain the observed baryon to entropy ratio [ 10 ] and a strong first - order electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) , necessary for the thermal out - of - equilibrium condition , can be obtained only for @xmath0 [ 1 ] , whereas the current experimental lower bound is @xmath1 .",
    "these difficulties have been overcome in models having extended higgs sectors , such as the minimally supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) [ 11 ] , its extensions [ 12 ] and the two - higgs doublet model ( thdm ) [ 13 ] .    among the models for the new physics at the @xmath2 scale , the littlest higgs model ( @xmath3hm ) [ 14 ] and its version with t parity ( lht ) [ 15 , 16 ] are economical and popular ones . in lht ,",
    "the aspects of cp violation have been studied [ 17 ] quite extensively in recent years . to examine the third criterion of sakharov , finite - temperature calculations are required .",
    "although indications of strong first - order ewpt have been reported in a number of papers involving supersymmetric [ 11,12 ] , two - higgs doublet [ 13 ] and extra - dimensional models [ 18 ] , the needed finite - temperature calculations in little higgs models are , so far , very few [ 19 - 21 ]",
    ". however , such studies should be quite interesting as , some of these [ 19 , 21 ] have exhibited a not - so - common and intriguing feature of finite - temperature effects , viz .",
    ", nonrestoration of symmetry at high temperature [ 19 , 21 , 22 ] , which might reveal new aspects of cosmological baryogenesis .    in this work ,",
    "we examine the prospects of baryogenesis in the lht in the light of the third criterion of sakharov .",
    "the present work is motivated by our earlier finding [ 21 ] of features of a strong first - order ewpt in the lht , in association with a nonrestoration of symmetry at high temperature . here",
    ", we calculate the baryon number violation rates for the _ t_-even and the _ t_-odd gauge bosons .",
    "we can find a new scenario of baryogenesis , where the _ t_-even particles are efficacious in producing very large amount of baryon number violation and the _ t_-odd ones check the wash - out .",
    "in section 2 , we present the gauge - higgs sector of the lht . in section 3",
    ", we examine the effect of the interaction between the _ t_-even and _ t_-odd gauge bosons on the sphaleron energy . in section 4 we calculate baryon number violation rates .",
    "finally , section 5 contains discussions , whereby we elaborate the baryogenesis scenario , and then some concluding remarks .",

    "however , invariance of @xmath7 under the _ t _ parity operations : @xmath8 and @xmath9 , will require @xmath10 , @xmath11 and therefore , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are sm weak and hypercharge gauge couplings . with these , after the tree - level explicit symmetry breaking at the tev scale by the vacuum condensate @xmath16 [ 21 ] , we shall have _",

    "correspond to sm gauge bosons . as in the sm",
    ", physical neutral gauge bosons are obtained via the mixing of the neutral partners of @xmath19 and @xmath20 with the weinberg angle , @xmath21 , which is given in terms of the coupling constants as , @xmath22 .",
    "spherically symmetric sphaleron will require @xmath23 and therefore @xmath24 .",
    "in that case , only the su(2 ) sectors in ( 1 ) will be operative . in the present work",
    ", we shall assume that @xmath23 .",
    "this assumption is justified by the observation [ 4 ] that the correction to the sphaleron energy due to the @xmath21 nonzero case is quite small : it is @xmath25 when @xmath26 to 0.96% when @xmath27 , @xmath28 being the higgs quartic self - coupling parameter . following the same spirit , in the present case also , we shall consider only the su(2 ) sector .",
    "t_-odd gauge bosons have masses both in the symmetric phase ( sp ) and broken phase ( bp ) of ewsb , because they get mass by explicit symmetry breaking while the lagrangian is gauged .",
    "t_-even gauge bosons become massive after the ewsb by the coleman - weinberg mechanism . as a general procedure ,",
    "we calculate the masses of the _ t_-even and _ t_-odd gauge bosons in the bp , using the vacuum condensate @xmath29 as in ref.21 and get in the leading order in _ s _ , @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 being the physical higgs field .",
    "the sp has an absolute minimum near @xmath33 and we have in this phase , @xmath34 and @xmath35 . here",
    "the heavy gauge boson mass is the one obtained by explicit symmetry breaking under _ t _",
    "parity , the light gauge bosons remaining massless . in the bp , both",
    "the light and heavy gauge bosons have h - dependent masses given in eq.(3 ) .",
    "it may be noted that , if @xmath36 ( the sm vev ) , then from ( 3 ) we find that the light gauge bosons show the sm mass , @xmath37 as @xmath38 .",
    "the higgs quartic self coupling constant @xmath28 , which is an important parameter in determining the sphaleron energy and transition rate , may be obtained numerically from the global higgs potential by the formula , @xmath39 where , @xmath40 is the temperature - independent one - loop - order effective potential , which is responsible for ewsb in @xmath41hm by coleman - weinberg mechanism .",
    "however , @xmath28 should be small enough for the validity of perturbative calculations and to be consistent with a not - so - large higgs mass .",
    "we find in our calculation that we can get small values of @xmath28 by reasonable choice of the uv completion factors [ 14,21 ] .",
    "the detailed procedure of how the uv completion factors are determined in our calculations is given in ref.21 .",
    "note that in eq.(4 ) , @xmath42 @xmath2 ( or @xmath43 ) is the value of the physical higgs field where the strong first - order ewpt is observed in the global structure of the finite - temperature effective potential [ 21 ] . it may be noted that the _ t _ parity forbids a non - zero vev for the triplet @xmath44 field [ 16 ] .",
    "thus , the @xmath44 field does not come in the consideration of phase transion in the present case .",
    "sphaleron is the time - independent static solution of the gauge - scalar lagrangian .",
    "the benchmark of our calculation is to make use of the sphaleron transition rate formula [ 5 ] of a pure su(2 ) gauge theory . in lht",
    "there are two @xmath45 groups : one for _ t_-even light gauge boson field and another for _ t_-odd heavy gauge boson field .",
    "_ t_-invariant interactions of the types @xmath46 and @xmath47 are present between the two sectors [ 23 ] .",
    "so , before using the classic formula one has to make sure that the contribution of the interaction terms is markedly small . to verify this fact we have constructed a toy model comprising the lagrangian of a pure su(2 ) theory plus a mass term for @xmath48 , as it gets mass from explicit symmetry breaking of the gauge group su(5 ) down to @xmath49_1 } \\otimes { [ su(2 ) \\otimes u(1)]_2}$ ] .",
    "the gauge - higgs energy in the model is as follows @xmath50 where , @xmath51 $ ] , is the time - independent gauge boson tensor .",
    "the first three terms in the integrand of ( 5 ) are for both the _ t_-even and _ t_-odd sectors . @xmath52",

    "+        in fig.1 we have plotted total gauge - higgs energy and have shown the effect of interaction . if we include the interactions the total energy shows only less than 1% change , which clearly hints that the effect of the _ t_-parity invariant interaction has negligible effect in sphaleron energy calculations .",
    "so the two @xmath69 sectors can be treated independent of one another and one can make use of sphaleron transition rate formula of a pure @xmath45 theory reliably .",

    "@xmath105 , we convert temperature to time using the dynamically- generated relation [ 27 ] in the radiation dominated early universe , @xmath106 sec .",

    "we have plotted @xmath105 vs. t , for the _ t_-odd gauge bosons for temperatures both below and above @xmath109 , the transition temperature of ewpt , and that for _ t_-even gauge boson above @xmath109 .",
    "it is to be noted that the value of @xmath109 in our case is 0.925 @xmath2 [ 21].the graphs in figs 2(a ) and 2(b ) clearly show that around the ewpt , the contribution of the _ t_-odd gauge bosons in the lht towards the ratio of the baryon number violation rate to the expansion rate of the universe is negligibly small . in particular , at t = 1 @xmath2 in the asymmetric phase , the baryon number violation rate is @xmath110 @xmath111 and the universe expansion rate is @xmath112 @xmath111 .    for the massless _",
    "t_-even particles in the symmetric phase , the lattice result [ 24 ] gives , @xmath113 . from this , we get [ 28 ] , @xmath114@xmath115 ( 1 @xmath116 ) .",
    "thus , the baryon number violation rate is @xmath117 times higher for the _ t_-even particles than the _ t_-odd ones .",
    "we find that at the value @xmath32=1.1 of the physical higgs field , where the phase transition is observed , both the _ t_-even and _ t_-odd gauge bosons have the same mass ( viz.,@xmath118 ) in the broken phase ( @xmath119 ) and the baryon number violation rate is seen to be negligibly small and effectively no baryon number violation takes place in the broken phase at high temperature . in the symmetric phase ( @xmath120 ) , the _ t_-even gauge boson becomes massless , the _ t_-odd ones remaining massive with mass @xmath121 . in this phase",
    ", we may consider bubbles inside which the higgs vev is zero .",
    "these bubbles would move in the background of asymmetric phase and the massless _",
    "t_-even particles and the massive _ t_-odd particles will be inside these bubbles .",
    "the sphalerons due to the _ t_-odd particles act as spectators so far as baryon number violation is concerned .",
    "input from non - perturbative sm lattice result [ 24 ] implies that the baryon number violation rate is 31 orders of magnitude higher for the _ t_-even particles than that for the _ t_-odd ones .",
    "since the phase transition is strongly first order the bubbles will be thin - walled and the cp - violating scattering of the _ t_-even particles will take place on the bubble walls .",
    "however , this situation will continue from the temperature scale @xmath122 to @xmath123 ( which corresponds to the time scale : @xmath124 sec to @xmath125 sec ) , when there will be smooth crossover [ 29 ] from a massless to a massive condition for the _ t_-even particle .",
    "baryogenesis ends at this point .",
    "our calculations are based on the existence of two independent @xmath45 gauge sectors for the _ t_-odd and the _ t_-even particles as verified by our calculation in section 3 and sm - like anomalies in the corresponding fermionic sectors .",
    "such anomalies have not yet been investigated so far within the lht . on the other hand , leptogenesis has been studied recenlty in @xmath3hm [ 30 ] and in other little higgs models [ 31 ] .",
    "thus , there is scope to obtain baryogenesis via leptogenesis in these models .",
    "we must note here that , as we are dealing with an inverted phase transition , the nature of the bubbles must be different from what they are in the sm .",
    "specifically , the bubbles are expected to shrink and ultimately disappear at the time of the cross - over .    in conclusion , in the present work we have explored the possibility of electroweak baryogenesis in the lht model .",
    "this is the first work on electroweak baryogenesis in a model where inverse phase transition occurs and has thus new features in it .",
    "nonetheless , we can get a clear picture of baryogenesis in the new scenario .",
    "we find that the _ t_-odd gauge bosons play crucial role in checking the washout .",
    "discovery of these new particles is expected in the large hadron collider and the future international linear collider experiments , for which the production cross sections have been estimated [ 32 , 33 ] .",
