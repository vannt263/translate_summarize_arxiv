    "the goal of this note is to provide a sharp estimate on the dimension of the set @xmath0 of three - period orbits in classical billiards .",
    "the question about lebesgue measure of the set of periodic orbits was raised by ivrii  @xcite , in connection with spectral geometry problems . the conjecture that periodic orbits have zero measure is still open , but several special cases have been resolved .",
    "the first result was due to rychlik @xcite who proved that the set of three - period orbits has zero lebesgue measure .",
    "more recently a proof for the four - period case has been announced in @xcite .    consider a not necessarily convex billiard boundary and define the billiard map @xmath1 in the standard way .",
    "the boundary of length @xmath2 is parametrized with a natural parameter @xmath3 . for an outgoing trajectory ,",
    "let @xmath4 be the angle with the tangent .",
    "then the billiard map @xmath5 is defined for any segment that is transversal to the boundary at both ends .",
    "we disregard those that are not , since they have zero measure .",
    "the billiard map is defined on an open annulus @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the boundary of length @xmath2 and @xmath8 the billiard map preserves the measure @xmath9 , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "rychlik s proof was simplified in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , see also a survey article @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "wojtkovski proved rychlik s theorem using jacobi fields .",
    "he first proved that if there is a neighborhood containing only three - period orbits , then the identity @xmath10 must hold , where @xmath11 is the boundary curvature and @xmath12 is the length of the three - period orbit @xmath13 . by fermat",
    "s principle , the length is extremized by the actual orbits , and thus @xmath12 is constant for any continuous family of orbits .",
    "the contradiction is easily derived by observing that , by varying @xmath4 , the right - hand side will change while the left - hand side will be constant .",
    "wojtkovski , following rychlik @xcite , extended the contradiction to the case when the set @xmath0 has positive lebesgue measure .",
    "the argument relies on the presence of a lebesgue density point in whose neighborhood one can differentiate the above identity in @xmath4 , arriving at a contradiction again .",
    "a natural question arises as to how optimal this result is .",
    "clearly , periodic orbits can form a one - parameter family , e.g. , in a billiard with circular boundary there is a one dimensional set of three - period orbits , so the hausdorff dimension can be equal to one .",
    "but can this set have the hausdorff dimension between one and two ?",
    "note that for the two - period orbits the answer is clearly no , since such orbits must be normal to the boundary .",
    "thus , @xmath14 and the set is confined to the one - dimensional line segment .",
    "our main result states that the similar sharp bound holds for the three - period orbits .",
    "[ t : main ] if the billiard boundary is @xmath15 , then the hausdorff dimension of the set of three - period orbits @xmath0 is not more than one , i.e. , @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the hausdorff @xmath18-dimensional measure .    in the case",
    "when the hausdorff dimension is equal to one , there is more information about the structure of the set @xmath0 , exhibited by the following theorem .",
    "see section  [ s : mt ] for the definitions .",
    "[ t:1reg ] assume the billiard boundary is @xmath15 and @xmath19 .",
    "then the set @xmath0 has a tangent line at @xmath20-almost every point @xmath21 .",
    "note that in the case of two - period orbits the analogous statement holds for the above reason : @xmath22 is confined to the line segment @xmath14 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ s : diff ] contains an elementary lemma on existence of a sequence converging to an accumulation point of a given set and that is asymptotic to a certain direction .",
    "it also provides an elementary formula for a directional derivative of a map via a sequence of points accumulating asymptotically in the given direction . in section  [ s : mt ]",
    "we define and develop the relevant notions from measure theory , mostly based on @xcite . in the last section",
    "we apply those results to prove main theorems on the structure of the set of three - period orbits .",
    "for two points @xmath23 and @xmath24 in @xmath25 , we denote by @xmath26 the euclidean distance between them .",
    "if @xmath27 and @xmath28 are two subsets of @xmath25 , we denote by @xmath29 the distance between them .",
    "we also denote by @xmath30 the euclidean diameter of a set @xmath31 .",
