    "in recent years static and spherically symmetric solutions of the einstein - yang - mills - higgs system have been intensively studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "one purpose of such investigation has been to understand the nature of black holes , especially in the context of the no - hair conjecture ; it was shown that non - trivial black holes are stable and hence the monopole black hole could be one of the most plausible counterexamples .",
    "the other interest has been in the properties of particle - like solutions ; it was shown that such regular monopoles exist only if the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field @xmath0 is less than a critical value @xmath1 , which is of the order of the planck mass @xmath4 .",
    "this result naturally gives rise to the next question : what is the fate of monopoles for @xmath5 ?    because the only static solution for @xmath2 is the reissner - nordstrm black hole , we can expect that a monopole which is regular initially evolves into the reissner - nordstrm black hole . even if this speculation is reasonable , we still do not know how the black hole formation occurs .",
    "one could imagine two alternatives : a monopole just shrinks , or its core continues to expand inside the black - hole horizon , just as a  child universe \" @xcite .",
    "linde and vilenkin independently pointed out the latter possibility in the context of the  topological inflation \" model @xcite .",
    "they claimed monopoles as well as other topological defects expand exponentially if @xmath6 .",
    "their discussions for the einstein - higgs system were verified by our numerical simulation in @xcite : we found that domain walls and global monopoles inflate if and only if @xmath7 . the next question on this monopole inflation is similarly what happens to magnetic monopoles in the einstein - yang - mills - higgs system . because we can not find an answer to the question only by analyzing static solutions , we investigate dynamic monopole solutions in this paper .    the plan of this paper is as follows . in sec",
    "ii , we derive the basic equations and explain how we solve those dynamical equations numerically . in sec .",
    "iii , we offer analytic discussions and numerical results .",
    "iv is devoted to summary and discussions . in this paper",
    "we use the units @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath9 einstein - yang - mills - higgs system is described by @xmath10,\\ ] ] with @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the @xmath15 yang - mills field potential and its field strength , respectively .",
    "@xmath16 is the real triplet higgs field and @xmath17 is its potential . @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the higgs self coupling constant and the gauge coupling constant , respectively . @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the spacetime covariant derivative and the totally covariant derivative , respectively .",
    "the variation of ( [ action ] ) with respect to @xmath22 , @xmath16 and @xmath23 yield the einstein equations , @xmath24 @xmath25 + f^a_{\\mu\\lambda}f^{a\\lambda}_{\\nu}-\\frac14g_{\\mu\\nu}(f^a _ { \\lambda\\sigma})^2,\\ ] ] and the equations for the matter fields , @xmath26 @xmath27    we assume a spherically symmetric spacetime and adopt the coordinate system , @xmath28 for the matter fields , we adapt the t hooft - polyakov ansatz in such a way that we can apply it to a time - dependent curved spacetime : @xmath29 @xmath30 with the metric ( [ metric ] ) and the t hooft - polyakov ansatz ( [ tp1 ] ) and ( [ tp2 ] ) , we write down the field equations ( [ ein])-([geq ] ) as @xmath31 , \\\\ % % % % % % % % \\frac12g_{01}&\\equiv & { k^2_2}'+\\bigl({b'\\over b}+{1\\over r}\\bigr)(3k^ 2_2-k ) = { 4\\pi\\over m_{{\\rm pl}}^{~2}}\\left[\\dot\\phi\\phi'+ { 2\\dot ww'\\over ( ebr)^2}\\right ] , \\label{mc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath32 @xmath33,\\ ] ] @xmath34 @xmath35 where the overdot and the prime denote the partial derivative with respect to @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "we have introduced the extrinsic curvature tensor of a @xmath38 constant hypersurface , @xmath39 , whose components are given by @xmath40 and we have denoted its trace by @xmath41 .    as an initial configuration of the matter fields , we adopt the functional form of the static solution in a flat spacetime with @xmath42 : @xmath43,\\nonumber\\\\ & & w(t=0,r ) = w_{{\\rm flat}}\\bigl({r\\over c_w}\\bigr)\\equiv{e\\eta r / c_w\\over\\sinh(e\\eta r / c_w)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the initial size parameters .",
    "the configurations of @xmath46 and of @xmath47 are illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . as to the time - derivative ,",
    "we suppose @xmath48 . in order to set up consistent initial data",
    ", we have to solve the constraint equations ( [ hc ] ) and ( [ mc ] ) . at this point , there are four unknown variables , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , in the two constraint equations ; two of the variables are arbitrarily chosen .",
    "one of the methods which is usually adopted is to assume @xmath51 const and @xmath52 . in this system , however , the condition of @xmath51 const @xmath53 is not appropriate because the far region is asymptotically flat .",
    "further , in the range where there exists no static solution , we can not fix @xmath54 even momentarily . as an alternative , thereby , we suppose @xmath55 and solve the constraint equations ( [ hc ] ) and ( [ mc ] ) to determine @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "this treatment is suitable for this system because we obtain @xmath58 which approaches zero as @xmath37 increases ; we can construct an asymptotically flat spacetime without iterative integration .",
    "we have also assumed @xmath59 : every point in the spacetime is locally expanding .",
    "the numerical boundary is fixed at @xmath60 or @xmath61 .    in order to solve the dynamical equations",
    ", we use a finite difference method with 2000 to 10,000 meshes .",
    "now we have six dynamical variables : @xmath62 and @xmath63 . equations ( [ dotk])-([kdef ] ) provide the next time - step of @xmath64 and @xmath63 , respectively . at each step , we integrate ( [ mc ] ) in the @xmath37-direction to obtain @xmath50 . in this way we have reduced spatial derivatives appearing in the equations , which may become seeds for numerical instability . the hamiltonian constraint equation ( [ hc ] )",
    "remains unsolved during the evolution and is used for checking numerical accuracy .",
    "we stop numerical computation when some errors exceed a few percent .    in order to understand the spacetime structure from the numerical data , it is useful to observe the signs of the expansion of a null geodesic congruence .",
    "nambu and siino @xcite also utilized this tool to study wormhole formation in a singlet scalar field system . for the metric ( [ metric ] ) , the expansion @xmath65 is written as @xmath66,\\ ] ] where @xmath67 is an outgoing @xmath68 or ingoing @xmath69 null vector .",
    "we observe the signs of @xmath65 at all points in the numerical spacetime .",
    "for later convenience , we define  ri \" as the region where both @xmath70 and @xmath71 are positive , and",
    " rii \" as the region where they are negative .",
    "we can interpret that the region around ri is de sitter - like and the region around rii is schwarzschild - like .",
    "the two - surface which bounds ri or rii is called an  apparent horizon \" .",
    "later , we will use the term  black hole horizon \" to refer to any boundary of rii . and",
    ", we will use the term  cosmological horizon \" in the sense that no information beyond it reaches the center of a monopole ; only the innermost boundary of ri is called the cosmological horizon .",
    "before we move on to numerical simulation , we offer a rough discussion on the effect of the gauge fields on the gravitational field . in our previous paper @xcite , we investigated the effect for static monopole solutions and found that the gauge fields generate an attractive force .",
    "this property is also described in the time - dependent coordinate system ( [ metric ] ) as follows .    in a homogeneous and isotropic spacetime",
    ", the evolution of the scale factor @xmath72 follows @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the energy density and the pressure of a matter , respectively .",
    "equation ( [ frw ] ) indicates that the sign of @xmath76 determines whether the acceleration of the cosmic expansion is positive or negative .",
    "we can extend this discussion to general spacetimes : the sign of @xmath77 determines whether a local region expands with positive acceleration or not .",
    "a corresponding equation in the present system to ( [ frw ] ) is ( [ dotk ] ) . at the origin , ( [ dotk ] )",
    "reduces to @xmath78 in the case of global monopoles , the second term of the right - hand side disappears , and hence the central region is always locally de sitter spacetime .",
    "if gauge fields exist , however , the local acceleration at the center also depends on the second term .",
    "although the exact value of @xmath79 can not be determined without solving the full dynamical equations , we can estimate its order by use of the static solution in a flat spacetime with @xmath42 .",
    "assuming @xmath80 with @xmath81 , we have @xmath82 which lets us understand how the local expansion of the spacetime in the center depends on @xmath83 .",
    "we see that , if @xmath84 , the monopole core is an attractive spacetime ; while , if @xmath85 , it is repulsive like de sitter spacetime .",
    "of course , if the initial configuration is quite different from that of the static solutions , i.e. , @xmath86 , the above discussion is not true .",
    "the dynamics may also depend on initial configuration .    in what follows , by use of the method in sec .",
    "ii , we will numerically integrate the field equations ( [ hc])-([ddotw ] ) .",
    "to show the results , we define @xmath87 as a proper distance in the radial direction : @xmath88 .",
    "we also define the boundaries of a monopole in two ways : @xmath89 at the position of @xmath90 and @xmath91 at the position of @xmath92 .",
    "we normalize time and length by the horizon scale defined as @xmath93 .",
    "first , we check our numerical code by solving the equations for the case of weak gravity . in fig .",
    "2 we set @xmath94 and @xmath95 , and give two initial configurations : @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "we plot the trajectories of @xmath98 .",
    "we find that the fields behaves stably ; this reasonable result indicates that our numerical code works well .",
    "from now on , we concentrate on the parameter range where no static solution exists . in fig .",
    "3 we set @xmath99 and @xmath95 , and give two initial configurations : @xmath96 in ( a ) and @xmath100 in ( b ) . in fig .",
    "3(a)(b ) we plot the trajectories of @xmath98 and @xmath101 as well as apparent horizons .",
    "the dynamics in these two cases contrast sharply : in ( a ) a monopole shrinks and black - hole horizons appear , while in ( b ) a cosmological horizon exists from the beginning and a monopole continues to expand .",
    "we also draw the distributions of @xmath102 in ( c ) and in ( d ) , which correspond to the results in ( a ) and in ( b ) , respectively . in ( c )",
    "the values around the center become negative at the beginning , but they bounce back to positive values , which confirms that the monopole core never inflates . on the other hand , in ( d )",
    "the values of @xmath102 around the center remain negative from the beginning .",
    "this behavior indicates that exponential expansion really occurs inside the monopole .",
    "these two results tell us that monopoles for @xmath2 tend to be dynamic , and their dynamics depends on the initial configuration , contrary to the case of global monopoles .    as we will see soon , for larger @xmath0 , monopoles are more likely to inflate rather than shrink .",
    "we show an example for larger @xmath0 in fig .",
    "4 ; we set @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath96 . in fig .",
    "4(a ) we plot the trajectories of @xmath98 and @xmath101 as well as apparent horizons .",
    "( please also refer to fig . 5 , which is a schematic sketch of the spacetime structure . ) from the beginning",
    "there are two apparent horizons , @xmath105 and @xmath106 : @xmath105 is the cosmological horizon .",
    "later other two apparent horizons , @xmath107 and @xmath108 , appear , and then @xmath106 and @xmath108 approach each other .",
    "these surfaces turn out to be black - hole horizons , @xmath109 and @xmath110 , the moment they intersect . in fig .",
    "4(b ) we draw the distributions of @xmath102 .",
    "contrary to the case of the contracting monopole in fig .",
    "3(a ) , the values around the center are initially positive , but they become negative .",
    "this suggests that , if @xmath0 is large enough , a monopole begins to expand exponentially even if its initial size is not so large .",
    "we also show in fig .",
    "4(c ) the relation between the proper distance along the radial direction and the circumference radius , which indicates a wormhole structure really appears . figure 4 lets us understand how the wormhole is created . because the expanding core is causally disconnected from the outer region , such an isolated region is called a  child universe \" .",
    "one may think that if @xmath2 , a monopole either expands or collapses , as shown in fig . 3 or 4 . however , we find some cases where a monopole neither expands nor collapses .",
    "an example of such solutions is shown in fig .",
    "6 ( @xmath111 and @xmath112 ) . setting @xmath96",
    ", we show the evolution of @xmath113 in ( a ) and that of @xmath63 in ( b ) , and the trajectories of @xmath98 and of @xmath101 in ( c ) .",
    "although some oscillations remain outside the monopole , the core of the monopole approaches a stable configuration .",
    "we change the initial size in fig .",
    "6(d ) , finding monopoles with any initial size behave stably .",
    "these results indicate that there exist stationary solutions .",
    "finally we systematically survey the dynamics of monopoles for @xmath119 and @xmath120 and summarize the solutions in the @xmath83-@xmath121 plane of fig . 7 .",
    "a square denotes a stable solution , as is the case in fig . 2 or 6 .",
    "a cross denotes the case where a monopole shrinks , as is the case in fig .",
    "a circle denotes the case where a monopole inflates and the wormhole structure appears , as is the case in fig .",
    "4 . a dotted line indicates the maximum values of @xmath121 versus @xmath83 , depicted approximately by use of fig.6 in @xcite .",
    "we vary @xmath44 and @xmath45 from 1 to 10 , and hence some parameter points are labeled as two symbols .",
    "we interpret these results as follows . in the case of @xmath122 ,",
    "a monopole expands exponentially if @xmath123 ; this critical value has little dependence on @xmath83 and initial configuration , and almost agrees with that for global monopoles @xcite .",
    "this agreement is quite reasonable because the effect of the gauge fields is smaller as @xmath83 is larger .",
    "below the critical value , a monopole tends to take a stable configuration even in the theories where static solutions are nonexistent . in the case of @xmath124",
    ", the dynamics also depend on @xmath83 and initial configuration . in some cases",
    "the effect of the gauge fields becomes dominant and a monopole shrinks and becomes a black hole .",
    "these results are consistent with our analytic discussions at the beginning of this section .",
    "we have studied the dynamics of magnetic monopoles numerically .",
    "our main purpose has been to understand the behavior of monopoles in the case where static solutions are nonexistent .",
    "if @xmath0 is large enough ( @xmath3 ) , a monopole inflates and a wormhole structure appears around it . we have shown how the wormhole connected with a child universe is created .",
    "we should emphasize that a child universe can be generated without fine - tuned initial conditions in this model , contrary to the case of a trapped false vacuum bubble @xcite . in the case of @xmath122 ,",
    "the condition of inflation is @xmath123 , which has little dependence on @xmath83 and initial configuration . below the critical value , a monopole tends to take a stable configuration even in the theories where static solutions are nonexistent .",
    "this is true for any initial configuration , which indicates the existence of stationary solutions . while , in the case of @xmath124 , the dynamics also depends on @xmath83 and initial configuration .",
    "in some cases the effect of the gauge fields becomes dominant and a monopole collapses into a black hole .",
    "we should notice that the condition of inflation was also estimated analytically in a simplified model by tachizawa et al.@xcite they discussed the global structure of a spacetime by regarding the inside the monopole core as de sitter spacetime and the outside as reissner - nordstrm spacetime .",
    "they showed that the surface of the monopole core exceeds a cosmological horizon if @xmath125 .",
    "this condition almost agrees with the condition of inflation for most cases in our analysis ; this agreement suggests that our numerical results are reasonable as well as that their simplified model is a good approximation in most cases . when the effect of the gauge fields is dominant to that of the higgs field , however , the spacetime is not de sitter - like , and then the validity of the simplified model is lost .    our results as a whole support the discussions of linde and vilenkin @xcite , who pointed out the possibility of monopole inflation",
    "actually , we have found that inflation happens in most cases of @xmath2 . further , if the initial size of a monopole is large enough , the effect of the gauge fields is not important , as linde mentioned .",
    "what we have clarified more about this subject is there are some cases where static solutions are nonexistent but monopoles do not continue to expand , as the results in figs . 6 and 7 .",
    "although we did not state this fact in our previous paper @xcite , it is also true for global monopoles .",
