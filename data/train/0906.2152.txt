    "large double radio sources come in two radio  morphological types .",
    "the more powerful type is the `` classical double '' or fr  ii source , whose prototype is cygnus a. this group has strong terminal `` hotspots '' , and generally one  sided arcsecond ( kpc ) scale .",
    "the other type , fr  is like centaurus a and m87 , is lower in radio luminosity , double  jetted , and edge  darkened @xcite .",
    "these sources mostly have symmetric kpc jets .",
    "it has been known since the 1960s that some of these giant ( @xmath0100kpc ) radio sources show powerful optical / uv continuum emission ( called `` big blue bump '' , or bbb ) from a central point source .",
    "this optical / uv emission is generally identified as thermal radiation from dense matter accreting onto supermassive black holes .",
    "the gravitational potential energy of this infalling matter is thought to power much or all of the observed activity .",
    "objects showing this strong optical / uv continuum and accompanying broad emission lines are classified as quasars and broad line radio galaxies ( hereafter , `` quasars '' ) . on the other hand , double",
    "radio sources without these components are called ( narrow line ) radio galaxies ( nlrgs ) .    many fr ",
    "ii nlrgs have hidden quasars detected by spectropolarimetry ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "ii nlrgs already indicate the presence of a `` classical '' agn ( those thought to accrete radiatively efficiently ) by their high ionization emission line ratios ( high ionization galaxies  hig ) .",
    "some fr  ii rgs and most fr  is , however , show only weak line emission of low ionization and are therefore classified as low ionization galaxies ( ligs ) . here",
    "a luminous agn ( if present ) has to be discovered at other wavelengths .",
    "alternatively , these radio galaxies may simply lack a hidden quasar .",
    "a lack of a bbb means , according to current wisdom , a lack of a copious and radiatively efficient accretion flow .",
    "historically such a situation was thought to require energy extraction from black hole rotation , and various mechanisms have been suggested for this ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively in principle accretion power could make the jet , yet not radiate significantly .",
    "in such a case the bbb is present , but of low power compared to a ( lobe  matched ) quasar bbb .    in an optical imaging study of 3cr fr ",

    "@xcite report unresolved central compact cores ( cccs ) in the centers of most observed galaxies .",
    "the correlation of optical ( at @xmath17000 ) compact cores and radio ( at 6 cm ) cores in flux and luminosity is taken as evidence for their common origin as synchrotron emission from the base of a jet .",
    "assuming that the base of the jet is found on scales _ smaller _ than any obscuring torus and considering the high detection rate of cccs ( 85% ) they argue that we see directly into the nucleus and thus no standard , geometrically thick torus can be present in most low ",
    "luminosity ( fr  i ) radio galaxies .",
    "since no broad lines or strong bbb emission is observed there could also be no hidden , radiatively efficient agn in those cases .",
    "however , e.g. @xcite note that if the emission from the jet occurs on scales larger than that of the torus the absence ( or presence ) of a torus can not be directly inferred from the observed nuclear jet components . in addition , high  resolution co maps have revealed massive nuclear tori like those invoked in the standard unified model in the center of at least two fr ",
    "i radio galaxies : 3c31 @xcite and ngc3801 @xcite .",
    "these tori have high molecular masses ( @xmath2@xmath3m@xmath4 ) , with high molecular column densities and probably geometrically thick shapes .    from an uv imaging study",
    "@xcite argue that the properties of fr  is are consistent with the classic unification models and the existence of an obscuring torus : while bl lac objects are well aligned sources , fr  i sources with nuclear uv components are at a critical angle for which a torus hides the nucleus but not the jet ( or the latter greatly outshines the former ) .",
    " is without nuclear uv components are thought to have a larger viewing angle where a torus hides the central regions completely .",
    "recently , some of the compact optical cores discovered by @xcite have been studied with imaging polarimetry revealing fairly large polarization ( @xmath511% ) which further indicates their non  thermal origin , though such high polarizations can also result from scattering @xcite .    in the x ",

    " related component of a strong agn ( associated with a luminous accretion disk and circumnuclear obscuring structure ) .",
    "in many fr  iis the latter is found _ in addition _ to the non  thermal jet component @xcite .",
    "thus , in fr  is any non  jet accretion  related x  ray component carries much lower intrinsic agn luminosities ( 10@xmath610@xmath7ergs@xmath8 ) or else their detection is hampered by column densities of well above @xmath9 .",
    "also @xcite argue that the ( soft ) x  rays in their fr ",
    "i sample can be accounted for by jet emission only .",
    "we must note however that fr  is with broad emission lines in the optical do exist ( e.g. 3c120 , @xcite ; see also @xcite for an anecdotal listing of such objects ) .",
    "such broad  line fr - is can extend up to quasar luminosities @xcite .",
    "we here present a study of the mid  infrared properties of a sample of fr ",
    "i radio galaxies .",
    "the motivation is to possibly detect a hidden agn by the reprocessed warm thermal dust emission as found in many fr  ii radio galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . and even in the case of exceptionally high extinction which attenuates also the mir luminosity , spectral features that give clues on the thermal or non - thermal origin of the emission might still be detectable . on the other hand , the nuclear part of the mir spectra bridges the gap in wavelength between the optical compact cores and the radio cores observed by @xcite .",
    "if there is in fact no hidden agn and no obscuring structure to be found in fr  is , the mir spectra should agree with synchrotron core estimates .",
