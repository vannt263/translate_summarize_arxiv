    "the mass function is one of the most important statistical quantities of dark halos .",
    "@xcite invented an ansatz to predict the mass function of dark halos formed through hierarchical clustering , assuming that each smoothed mass element with arbitrary smoothing length evolves independently , in accordance with the spherical top - hat model .",
    "the ps formalism was extended so that the merging history of each halo is traceable @xcite .",
    "this extended ps formalism has been used in a wide range of applications .",
    "especially the so - called semi - analytic galaxy models @xcite use it to successfully reproduce many properties of observed galaxies    the ps mass function and the mass function from @xmath1-body simulations agree with each other only qualitatively @xcite , and modification to threshold linear overdensity leads to a better agreement @xcite .",
    "however , the ps mass function gives the smaller number of high - mass halos @xcite , while giving the larger number of low - mass halos when compared with the @xmath1-body mass functions @xcite .",
    "this tendency was confirmed over a mass range by connecting the numerical mass functions from simulations with different box sizes @xcite .",
    "taking into account the spatial correlation of density fluctuations @xcite , or incorporating the ellipsoidal collapse model into the ps ansatz instead of the spherical collapse model @xcite , an agreement was improved between the numerical mass function and the analytic mass function , especially the st mass function proposed by @xcite .",
    "in addition , the mass function of cluster progenitors has also been studied @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the numerical mass function depends on the cluster finding algorithm adopted @xcite .",
    "* hereafter j01 ) demonstrated that the friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm @xcite with a fixed linking length of 0.2 times the mean particle separation results in the numerical mass function that shows the best universality for various compositions of cosmological parameters and box sizes .",
    "thus , it is better to set the threshold density proportional to the _ background _ mass density rather than to the _ critical _ density .",
    "* hereafter w02 ) supported the above argument and demonstrated that an other definition of mass of halos , @xmath8 , gives the universal numerical mass function . here",
    ", @xmath8 is the mass within a sphere whose average density is 180 times the _ background _ density .",
    "however , different authors support different mass functions . for example , proposed a new fitting formula to the universal mass function , while supported the st mass function ( see also * ? ? ? * ) . since the mass function of high - mass halos has extensively been studied by them , this discrepancy is possibly due to the lack of information on the behavior of the numerical mass function for low - mass halos .",
    "thus , in order to investigate the functional form of the universal mass function , we performed five runs of @xmath1-body simulations with high mass resolution .    in this paper , we briefly describe our simulation code and cosmological and simulation parameters adopted in  2 .",
    "results of the simulations as well as the parameter values for the best - fit mass function are given in  3 , and discussions are given in  4 .",
    "the multiplicity function is the differential distribution function of the normalized fluctuation amplitude of dark halos for each mass element . according to the definition by @xcite , the multiplicity function",
    "is defined as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number density of dark halos , @xmath11 is the peak height of a halo , @xmath12 is the linear overdensity at the collapse epoch of halos given by the spherical collapse model , and @xmath13 is the standard deviation of the density fluctuation field smoothed by the top - hat window function .",
    "note that the time evolution of the number density and the dependence of the number density on the initial power spectrum are absorbed in @xmath14 . since this universality of the multiplicity function",
    "is guaranteed under the ps ansatz , we compare our simulation results with analytic multiplicity functions .    along with the ps ansatz , @xcite proposed the following analytic multiplicity function : @xmath15 this ps multiplicity function has successfully predicted the numerical multiplicity function in a qualitative manner .",
    "however , @xcite proposed an alternative analytic multiplicity function that could better reproduce the numerical multiplicity function : @xmath16 where @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is a normalization factor defined so that @xmath19 . because of this unity constraint , @xmath18 is not an independent parameter , but is expressed in forms of @xmath20 : @xmath21^{-1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xcite gave the best - fit parameter values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the ps multiplicity function is included in this st multiplicity function with @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "the st multiplicity function has a maximum at @xmath26 that satisfies the following equation : @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "it is trivial to see @xmath29 for the case of the ps multiplicity function .    also proposed an analytic multiplicity function which gives a fit to their numerical multiplicity function : @xmath30",
    "the valid range of this fitting formula is @xmath31 .",
    "hereafter we assume that @xmath32 in the above equation is constant and takes the value in the einstein - de sitter universe , i.e. @xmath33 in order to compare the j01 multiplicity function with other functions .",
    "we used the adaptive mesh refinement @xmath1-body code developed by @xcite , which is a vectorized and parallelized version of the code described in @xcite .",
    "all five runs of simulations we performed adopt the @xmath0cdm cosmological parameters of @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , using @xmath2 particles in common .",
    "the size of the finest mesh is 1/64 of the base mesh , and the force dynamic range is @xmath38 .",
    "other simulation parameters , such as the box size and the particle mass are given in table [ tab : sim ] .",
    "initial conditions were generated by the grafic2 code provided by @xcite using the power spectrum given by @xcite .",
    "five runs produced 529 files , and each of them was analyzed by the fof algorithm with a constant linking length of 0.2 times the mean particle separation .",

    "the mass functions of dark halos are shown in figure [ fig : mf ] .",
    "the upper and lower panels show the mass functions at @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively . the ps mass function",
    "is represented by solid lines , and the st mass function by dashed lines . at both redshifts ,",
    "the numerical mass functions from our simulations agree with the st mass function in a mass range of @xmath41 .",
    "the numerical multiplicity functions are shown by crosses in five panels of figure [ fig : mltpl ] .",
    "all the data from the initial redshift to the present @xmath40 is compiled to draw the average curves ( _ crosses _ ) with error bars indicating the epoch to epoch variation . in the panel ( f ) , all the numerical multiplicity functions are shown by thin lines .",
    "dark halos that consist of less than 600 particles are not used in calculating the multiplicity function , and 1/64 dex - sized bins containing less than 100 halos are excluded to avoid the contamination of the rare objects .",
    "three analytic multiplicity functions described in the previous section are also shown in this figure , that is ps ( _ solid lines _ ) , st ( _ dashed lines _ ) , and j01 ( _ dotted lines _ ) .",
    "the best - fit functions based on the st functional form are also shown by dot - dashed lines .",
    "the best - fit parameters are given in table [ tab : fit ] and are very close to those of .",
    "since the data are available only in the region at @xmath42 , these functions could be erroneous at @xmath43 .    in most cases , the numerical multiplicity functions and the best - fit functions to them",
    "are consistent with the st and j01 multiplicity functions at @xmath43 .",
    "however , each of the numerical multiplicity functions reside between the st and j01 functions at @xmath44 , and is below the st function at @xmath45 except for the 35b run .",
    "the numerical multiplicity functions have an apparent peak at @xmath46 , instead of a plateau as seen in the j01 function .",
    "we here proposed the following function to fit to the numerical multiplicity function : @xmath47 \\nu^d \\exp[-(b \\nu)^2/2 ] \\nu f(\\nu ) = a [ 1+(b \\nu / \\sqrt{2})^c ]",
    "\\nu^d \\exp[-(b \\nu/\\sqrt{2})^2 ] , \\label{eq:4fit}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath18 is a normalization factor to satisfy the unity constraint , @xmath19 , therefore @xmath48 + \\gamma[(c+d)/2]\\}^{-1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the best - fit parameters are given as @xmath49=0.893 , @xmath50=1.39 , and @xmath51=0.408 , and from these parameters , @xmath18 is constrained so that @xmath52 . this best - fit function from equation [ eq:4fit ]",
    "is shown in figure [ fig:4fit ] and is only valid at @xmath53 .",
    "since the unity constraint is only an assumption , we can relax this constraint and treat @xmath18 as a free parameter .",
    "actually , almost a half of the particles are not bound to any halos as shown in table [ tab : unbnd ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the best - fit parameters without the unity constraint using equation [ fig:4fit ] are @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , for which @xmath58 .",
    "since the fraction of bound particle should not exceed unity , we assign the unity constraint to all the best - fit functions below .",
    "we also investigate the peak position of the multiplicity functions .",
    "since deriving @xmath59 directly from the numerical multiplicity function is difficult due to the numerical fluctuation around the maximum value , we derived @xmath59 from the best fit st function by solving equation [ eq : numax ] .",
    "these @xmath59 are given in table [ tab : fit ] , and are very close to unity .",
    "for reference , @xmath60 for the j01 multiplicity function , and @xmath61 for the multiplicity function proposed by @xcite .",
    "we also checked the time dependence of the multiplicity function .",
    "figure [ fig : timedep ] shows the multiplicity function from the 35a run , for four redshift ranges of @xmath62 ( _ circles _ ) , @xmath63 ( _ squares _ ) , @xmath64 ( _ triangles _ ) , and @xmath65 , ( _ crosses _ ) . at high redshifts , high-@xmath14 halos in the exponential part of the best - fit st function and equation [ eq:4fit ] are probed .",
    "as redshift decreases , the probe window moves to the lower-@xmath14 region .",
    "since there are no modes of density fluctuations whose wave length is larger than the box size on which the periodic boundary is placed .",
    "the numerical multiplicity function is conditional such that @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the density contrast smoothed over a mass scale comparable to the box size . since our box size is smaller than that of other groups , we have estimated this box - size effect comparing the unconditional ps multiplicity function using the sharp @xmath68-space filter with the conditional one @xcite , @xmath69 } , \\label{eq : cndps}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 . setting @xmath71 , this effect is found to be not so large at @xmath42 for the box size of 35@xmath3mpc , and it makes the universality of the multiplicity function even worse .",
    "we have performed five runs of @xmath1-body simulations with high mass resolution in order to study the behavior of the numerical multiplicity function in the low - mass range , or the low-@xmath14 region . throughout the peak range of , @xmath53",
    ", the st functional form provides a good fit to them with parameter values of @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "these values are very close to those of .",
    "our numerical multiplicity functions have a peak at @xmath7 as in the st function , instead of a plateau in the j01 function .    however , some detailed discrepancies are seen between our numerical multiplicity functions and the st and j01 analytic functions .",
    "first , in the low-@xmath14 region of @xmath45 , our numerical multiplicity functions systematically fall below the st and the j01 functions , while they are consistent with that of . on the other hand , in the high-@xmath14 region , where @xmath14 is significantly larger than unity , our numerical multiplicity functions take values between the st and j01 functions . although these differences are within 1 @xmath74 error bars , they are possibly due to the different box sizes adopted .",
    "@xcite used the data from the gif simulations @xcite with the box size of 144@xmath3mpc or less , and mainly used the data from the box size of 200@xmath3mpc . on the other hand , used the 3000 @xmath3mpc simulation at maximum .",
    "we have taken into account the box - size effect using the conditional ps multiplicity function ( equation [ eq : cndps ] ) but this effect is found to be too small to resolve this problem . introducing the estimation using the conditional multiplicity function based on the unconditional multiplicity function which fits the numerical multiplicity function well , such as the st multiplicity function , would resolve this problem .",
    "however , such an improved estimation of the box - size effect might be weaker than the estimation based on the ps function , because the unconditional st function at @xmath75 has a broad peak that is below that of the ps function .",
    "the fact that our numerical multiplicity functions keep the universality supports this line of argument .",
    "thus , there are two discrepancies remained .",
    "one is the discrepancy between the numerical and analytical multiplicity functions .",
    "although our newly proposed functional form ( equation [ eq:4fit ] ) provides a better fit when compared with the st functional form ( equation [ eq : st ] ) , we need an analytic function based on a theoretical background which fits the numerical multiplicity function even better .",
    "the other one is the discrepancy in the numerical multiplicity functions from various simulation runs .",
    "there are three strategies to resolve this discrepancy .",
    "the first is to run simulations having still higher mass dynamic range free from the box size effect .",
    "the second is to increase the number of realizations as did , because there is a scatter from the runs using the same box size .",
    "the third is to run simulations whose box size is _ smaller _ than that of the present work , although it might sound contradictorily . from simulations with smaller box size ,",
    "we will obtain the information on the conditional multiplicity function which coincides with the unconditional multiplicity function at @xmath76 .",
    "comparing the unconditional multiplicity function from simulations with a large box size and the conditional multiplicity function from those of a small box size will offer not only the clues to resolve the above mentioned discrepancies , but also insights into the mechanism how the ps ansatz works to reproduce the numerical multiplicity function .",
    "simulations described in this paper were carried out using fujitsu - made vector parallel processors vpp5000 installed at the astronomical data analysis center , national astronomical observatory of japan ( adac / naoj ) , under the adac / naoj large scale simulation projects ( group - id : myy26a , yhy35b ) .",
