    "the solar neutrino anomaly has been more and more strongly established both in its experimental  @xcite as well as in its theoretical  @xcite aspect . in fact , both have presented a very dynamical evolution . from one side , theoretical predictions ,",
    "i.e. , the standard solar models ( ssm ) , have been refined by including several mechanisms such as helium diffusion  @xcite and an updating analysis of the @xmath2 astrophysical factor  @xcite .",
    "one can see in ref .",
    "@xcite that theoretical predictions obtained by different ssms , which are developed independently , are in good agreement with each other .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that the ssm is in excellent agreement with the helioseismology @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , experimental data have become more accurate due to the calibration of the experiments , more statistics and the existence of the new generation superkamiokande experiment and its solar neutrino spectral observations  @xcite .",
    "consequently , final numbers related to the solar neutrino deficit have also evolved significantly .",
    "the most updated experimental data as well as theoretical predictions are shown in table i. one can show that these observed solar neutrino data are in strong disagreement with the ones predicted by the ssm @xcite .",
    "moreover , this conclusion does not depend on any details of the ssm .",
    "solutions to the solar neutrino problem rely on different phenomena  @xcite which deplete the number of observable neutrinos at the earth : neutrino oscillations in vacuum  @xcite , resonantly enhanced matter oscillations  @xcite , resonant spin - flavor precession phenomenon ( rsfp )  @xcite and flavor mixing by new interactions  @xcite .",
    "the capability of each one of these processes to make compatible solar neutrino predictions and observations and therefore to find a solution to the solar neutrino anomaly have been updated from time to time  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we investigate the current status of the rsfp scenario @xcite .",
    "we believe that it is worthwhile to reanalyse this mechanism in the light of new solar neutrino data as well as the new ssm .",
    "we also discuss briefly how the solar neutrino spectral observations in superkamiokande are affected by the rsfp mechanism .",
    "0.5 cm    [ tab : data ]    .observed solar neutrino event rates used in this analysis and corresponding predictions from the reference standard solar model @xcite .",
    "the quoted errors are at @xmath3 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : chi2 ]    we have repeated the same analysis also for the dirac neutrino case .",
    "we , however , do not show the plots for the allowed region since they are rather similar to what have been presented above , if the same magnetic field profile is assumed . instead , for the case of dirac neutrinos , we only present the best fitted parameters and @xmath4 in the parentheses in table iii .",
    "we see from this table that , the dirac case always leads to a worse fit if the same magnetic field profile is assumed . to understand this we should note that for the dirac case , @xmath5 s are converted into the right handed muon ( or tau ) neutrino , which do not contribute to any of the solar experiments including the water chrenkov experiment @xcite .",
    "in contrast in the majorana case , converted right handed neutrino @xmath6 s do contribute to the signal observed in the superkamiokande detector .",
    "this makes it difficult to conciliate the difference between the superkamiokande and data .",
    "let us now comment about the possibility of having such strong magnetic field in the sun . while there is no generally accepted theory of solar magnetic field , it is possible to bound the field strength from very general arguments .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the magnetic field less than 10@xmath7 kg in the solar core or less than 10@xmath8 kg in the solar convective zone , will hardly affect the thermal structure and nuclear reaction processes well described by the standard solar model .",
    "these values come from the requirement that the magnetic pressure should be much smaller than the gas pressure , and can be regarded as the most generous upper limits of the magnetic field inside the sun .",
    "more stringent bounds on the magnetic field in the convective zone are found in refs . @xcite where the discussion is based on the non - linear effects which eventually prevents the growth of magnetic fields created by the dynamo process .",
    "naive limit can be obtained by estimating the required field tension necessary to prevent a fluid element from sinking into a magnetically stratified region , so that the magnetic flux would not be further amplified . by equating the magnetic tension to the energy excess of a sinking element at the bottom of the convective zone , schmitt and rosner @xcite obtained @xmath9 kg as an upper bound for the magnetic field , which is of the order of the magnitude we need to have a good fit to the solar data by rsfp mechanism for the reference value of magnetic moment , @xmath10 @xmath11 .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss how the recoil electron energy spectra in the superkamiokande detector will be affected by the rsfp mechanism @xcite . in fig . 5 ( a ) we plot the electron neutrino survival probabilities as a function of neutrino energy using the best fit parameters . in fig",
    ". 5 ( b ) we plot the recoil electron energy spectra divided by the standard prediction expected to be observed in the superkamiokande detector , using also the best fit parameters as in fig . 5 ( a )",
    ". in fig . 5 ( b ) we also plot the latest data from superkamiokande @xcite .",
    "as we can see from the plot the observed data indicate some distortion mainly due to the last three data points in the higher energy bins .",
    "we , however , note from this plot that it seems difficult to exclude , at this moment , any of our predicted spectra expected from different field profiles , because of the experimental errors .",
    "we have to wait for more statistics and more careful analysis from the experimental group before drawing any definite conclusion .",
    "1.4 cm -6.2 cm 8.8 cm",
    "we have reanalysed the rsfp mechanism as a solution to the solar neutrino problem in the light of the latest experimental data as well as the theoretical predictions .",
    "we found that the quality of the rsfp solution to the solar neutrino anomaly crucially depends on the solar magnetic field configuration along the neutrino trajectory inside the sun .",
    "we found that the best fit to the observed solar neutrino data , which seems to be even better than the usual msw solution as far as the total rates are concerned , is obtained if intensive magnetic fiels in the convective zone is assumed , in agreement with the conclusion found in ref .",
    "@xcite , whereas the linearly decaying magnetic field gives the worst fit . we , however , note that the required magnitude of the free parameters involved in the process , i.e. , the magnetic field strength multiplied by the neutrino magnetic moment @xmath12 and the squared mass difference @xmath13 , points to the same order , @xmath14  kg and @xmath15 few times @xmath16  ev@xmath17 , for any of the field profiles assumed in this work .    our ignorance about the profile as well as",
    "the magnitude of the solar magnetic field makes this approach to the solar neutrino observation less predictive than its alternative approaches  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the presence of this mechanism opens some interesting possibilities .",
    "one possibility is to look for any time variation of the solar neutrino signal @xcite which can not be expected in other alternative solutions found in refs .",
    "any time variation of the solar neutrino signal which can be attributed to some time variation of the solar magnetic field can be a good signature of this mechanism .",
    "although superkamiokande has not yet confirmed any significant time variation up to experimental uncertainty this possibility remains .",
    "another possibility is to look for the solar @xmath18 flux , which can not be produced in the usual msw or vacuum oscillation case but can be produced in rsfp mechanism if the flavor mixing is included .",
    "@xmath6 produced by rsfp mechanism can be converted into @xmath18 by the usual vacuum oscillation .",
    "@xcite suggests to observe ( or to put upper bound of ) @xmath18 flux in the superkamiokande whereas ref .",
    "@xcite suggests to use low energy solar neutrino experiment such as borexino or hellaz .",
    "we finally stress that rsfp mechanism can still provide a good solution to the solar neutrino problem , comparable in quality to msw or just so solution , and is not excluded by the present solar neutrino data .",
