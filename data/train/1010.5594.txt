    "the phonon spectrum of a crystalline solid provides information on several important physical properties like sound velocities , thermal conductivity , heat capacity and thermal expansion .",
    "the phonon spectrum of graphite has been intensively studied experimentally  @xcite and theoretically  @xcite in the past and some models have also been shown to be accurate for the description of fullerenes  @xcite and of graphite slabs  @xcite . in the more recent past , raman spectroscopy has proven to be of crucial importance also for the characterization of graphene and nanotubes as well as for graphitic nanostructures of lower symmetry , like bent tubes and graphene edges  @xcite . however , the many unusual structural aspects of graphene , like the observed ripples  @xcite , negative thermal expansion  @xcite , edge reconstruction  @xcite and localized  @xcite and extended defects  @xcite make it desirable to describe the energetics of carbon in different structural and bonding configurations beyond the harmonic approximation by means of a unique potential . bond order potentials are a class of empirical interatomic potentials ( eips ) designed for this purpose  @xcite",
    ". they aim at describing not only the structure around equilibrium but also anharmonic effects  @xcite and the possible breaking and formation of bonds in structural phase transitions like the graphite to diamond transition where the character of the bonding changes from sp@xmath0 to sp@xmath1  @xcite . in view of this larger and exacting scope",
    "it may be expected that the phonon spectra derived from these potentials are not as accurate as those derived from models meant to describe a single specific situation .",
    "however they allow to study , without further adjustment of parameters , all carbon structures , including the effect of defects , edges and other structural changes , also as a function of temperature .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to evaluate the force constants and phonon spectrum of graphitic structures derived from the long - range carbon bond order potential ( lcbopii )  @xcite and compare these results to experimental values , force constant models and to the tersoff  @xcite and brenner  @xcite bond order potentials for carbon .",
    "the phonon dispersions of graphene and graphite have been measured experimentally  @xcite , determined from _ ab initio _ calculations  @xcite and calculated from bond order eips  @xcite .",
    "the _ ab initio _ results generally agree very well with experimental measurements whereas widely used eips such as the tersoff  @xcite and brenner  @xcite potentials give less accurate results  @xcite , particularly in the optical region .",
    "one reason for this is that the range of interatomic interactions in eips is limited for computational efficiency whereas force constant models show that interatomic force constants ( ifcs ) up to fourth or even fifth nearest neighbours ( nns ) must be included for accurate phonon dispersions  @xcite .",
    "the second generation lcbopii  @xcite eip includes long - range interactions up to 6   which is well beyond fifth nns in graphene and it is interesting to study their effect on the phonons in comparison to other approaches .        in section  [ sec :",
    "methods ] we describe the computational method with emphasis on the anomalous dispersion of the flexural mode . in section  [ sec : phonon ] we present the lcbopii phonon dispersion of graphene and graphite , compare our force constants to other models and examine the role of specific force constants on the phonon dispersions . we devote section  [ sec : bendingrigidity ] to the analysis of the bending rigidity and its temperature dependence . in section  [ sec : other ] we show the phonons of ( 10,10 ) nanotubes and show the relevance of low - energy phonons of multilayer graphene for their characterization .",
    "the phonon dispersions are calculated by means of standard lattice dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the interatomic force constants are calculated by evaluating , by central differences , the second derivatives ( the ifcs ) of the lcbopii eip with respect to atomic displacements around their equilibrium positions .",
    "the phonon frequencies at wavevector @xmath2 , @xmath3 , are determined by diagonalizing the dynamical matrix @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the force constant matrix , @xmath6 being cartesian indices , for two atoms @xmath7 and @xmath8 in unit cells separated by a lattice vector @xmath9 . in layered materials the lowest ,",
    "out - of - plane , acoustic phonon branch ( za ) has a peculiar quadratic dispersion near the zone center with a coefficient determined by the bending rigidity @xmath10 of the crystal . for graphite ,",
    "it has been shown by lifshitz  @xcite that the dispersion has the following form : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the mass density , @xmath13 is the shear elastic constant , @xmath14 is the lattice parameter equal to twice the interlayer distance in @xmath15 stacked graphite , @xmath16 is the in - plane lattice parameter and @xmath17 is the atomic mass of carbon . for graphene",
    ", the dispersion reduces to a purely quadratic form : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is now a two - dimensional mass density .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     to gain more insight in the origin of the discrepancies with experiments we compare in table  [ table2 ] the force constants of lcbopii to ifc sets proposed in refs .",
    "the coordinate system is chosen such that @xmath20 is the coordinate along the line connecting two atoms , @xmath21 is the in - plane coordinate perpendicular to this direction and @xmath22 is the coordinate perpendicular to the plane .",
    "the ifcs between @xmath23-th nns in these directions are respectively the bond stretching , @xmath24 , the transverse , @xmath25 , and the out - of - plane , @xmath26 , force constants .",
    "the general form of the force constant matrix for the @xmath23-th nns in graphene is @xmath27 where the off - diagonal , @xmath28 , elements for @xmath29 are equal to zero due to the hexagonal symmetry , @xmath30 ev / @xmath0 and @xmath31 ev / @xmath0 for lcbopii .",
    "the ifcs from ref .",
    "@xcite are obtained by fitting a fourth nn force constants model to experimental values , those from ref .",
    "@xcite are derived from an extended brenner eip , also fitted to experimental values , and the ifcs from ref .",
    "@xcite are from a fourth nn force constant model including a nonzero @xmath32 of -0.57 ev / @xmath0 fitted to the dispersion obtained _ ab initio _ within the dft - gga approximation .    from the comparison of table [ table2 ]",
    "we see that the first nn ifcs are very similar to the fitted force constants of the reference models .",
    "however the decay of the lcbopii force constants beyond first nns is too rapid compared to the sets of ifcs which reproduce the experimental values accurately .        to see how the in - plane phonon branches evolve",
    "if larger ifcs beyond first nns are included we manually increase these force constants .",
    "we consecutively changed the in - plane ifcs from second to fifth nns to match those from ref .",
    "@xcite . since @xmath33 is already 23% lower than the fitted values we changed the out - of - plane ifcs from first nns .",
    "they were matched to those obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite since their model includes interactions up to fourth nns only which better resembles lcbopii .",
    "the resulting phonon dispersions are shown in fig .",
    "the modification of the in - plane ifcs beyond first nns clearly improves the phonon dispersion .",
    "changes up to third nns lower the frequencies of the transverse branches , particularly the to branch along @xmath34 and the ta branch at the @xmath35-point but perturbs the good agreement of the sound velocities of the linear modes . with",
    "in - plane ifcs changed up to fifth nns the dispersion is in excellent agreement with experiments .",
    "this means that an improvement of only the long - range interactions of lcbopii can considerably improve the accuracy of the potential for graphitic systems .",
    "however , this is not an easy task , since in the construction of lcbopii short and long range interactions are fitted simultaneously . for the out - of - plane branches the optical zo branch is greatly improved by the increase of the first nn ifc but the important quadratic behaviour of the za mode is lost .",
    "interestingly the quadratic dispersion is recovered only once fourth nns interaction is included .",
    "the bending rigidity @xmath10 is the key quantity which characterizes the mechanical properties of membranes  @xcite . for a crystalline membrane like graphene it is intimately related to the quadratic za branch through eq .  .",
    "reported values of @xmath10 vary from 0.79 to 2.13 ev  @xcite . besides the different techniques used to calculate @xmath10 and the different models of carbon interactions there might be other reasons for the confusing variety of reported values .",
    "first , when comparing the values of @xmath10 for graphite and graphene , one should consider the bending rigidity _ per layer _ and not per unit cell since the latter results in a factor two difference .",
    "in fact , since graphite has two graphene layers in the unit cell , the coefficients of the @xmath36 term in eqs .   and   differ by a factor two while ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) the quadratic coefficients should be approximately equal .",
    "the second , more important reason , is that the bending rigidity of graphene has been found to be strongly temperature dependent in detailed monte carlo simulations  @xcite .",
    "contrary to liquid membranes  @xcite , @xmath10 increases with increasing temperature .",
    "this increase reaches roughly 40% already at room temperature  @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of the bending rigidity implies that also the za phonon mode should depend on temperature which makes comparison of zero temperature dispersion as presented here to the room temperature experimental values non straightforward .    from the fit of eq .   to the za dispersion along the @xmath37 line we obtain for the bending rigidity @xmath38 ev for graphene .",
    "the same procedure for graphite with eq .",
    "yields @xmath39 ev per layer and @xmath40 pa . this value of @xmath13 is much lower than the experimental value of @xmath41 pa  @xcite due to the too small corrugation energy of lcbopii which gives a difference of about 1.5 mev / atom against about 10 mev / atom  @xcitebetween @xmath42 and @xmath43 graphite stacking . as a consequence , the transverse modes of graphite for wavevectors parallel to the @xmath14-axis shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , have too low frequencies .",
    "the bending rigidities of graphite and graphene per layer are the same , which is in agreement with the results from ref .",
    "@xcite who find almost equal bending rigidities per layer for graphene and bilayer graphene .",
    "the value of 0.69 ev is low compared to other studies and also lower than the 0.82 ev reported earlier for lcbopii at zero temperature  @xcite .",
    "this value was obtained by evaluating the elastic energy per unit area @xmath44 of carbon nanotubes .",
    "this energy is equal to @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the curvature of the nanotube .",
    "the apparent discrepancy with the result from the phonons is due to the fact that in forming a nanotube from graphene both elastic and torsional energy occur and it is only in the limit of very large nanotubes that the torsion energy can be neglected .",
    "we calculated the elastic energy , and the corresponding bending rigidity , for several nanotubes with radii from 11 to 70   with and without the inclusion of the torsion term . the results in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] clearly demonstrate that @xmath44 is a linear function of @xmath47 , without torsion , indicating a constant @xmath48 ev . with the inclusion of the torsion term",
    "the resulting @xmath10 increases with the radius of the nanotube . for large nanotubes , with small torsion angles ,",
    "the value of 0.69 ev found from the phonons is recovered . the value of 0.82 ev from ref .",
    "@xcite was indeed determined from a nanotube with a radius of approximately 11  .",
    ", versus the curvature squared , @xmath47 , for nanotubes of varying radius . the slope of this curve determines the bending rigidity @xmath10 .",
    "the inset shows the bending rigidity determined for individual nanotubes . ]",
    "for completeness , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] also the phonons of a ( 10,10 ) nanotube that can be compared to refs .  @xcite . for nanotubes the differences between models",
    "are enhanced due the complex folding of the bands .",
    "lastly , we examine the phonons of @xmath49-layer , @xmath43 stacked , graphene , going from a single graphene layer towards graphite . in this process ,",
    "the low - frequency za mode splits into @xmath49 optical sub - branches as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] while for all other branches the splitting is much smaller ( @xmath502  @xmath51 ) . as shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the frequency of these ` breathing ' modes at @xmath52 for @xmath49-layer graphene are related to the longitudinal phonons of graphite along the @xmath53 line at wavevectors @xmath54 as if the modes were confined to an effective thickness of @xmath55 .",
    "this length is an interplanar distance larger than the actual thickness of the @xmath49-layer graphene .",
    "interestingly , by extrapolating to a single layer , @xmath56 , we get an effective thickness equal to an interplanar distance , as suggested in ref .  @xcite . since the number and frequency of these low lying za modes is univocally determined by the number of graphene layers , their observation can be used for the characterization of multilayer graphene as a complement to the analysis relying on the @xmath57 band done in refs .",

    "the horizontal lines across the panels show that the modes of @xmath49-layer graphene at @xmath52 coincide with those of graphene at the wavevectors given by eq .  .",
    "empirical potentials are desirable for their simplicity and transferability to calculate the phonon frequencies of complex systems .",
    "the phonon dispersions of graphite and graphene are an important test for the accuracy of these eips .",
    "we have shown that lcbopii gives good results for graphitic crystals particularly in comparison to other eips .",
    "we have analyzed the reasons for the remaining discrepancies , suggesting that the potential could be improved considerably by modification of the long - range interactions .",
    "the quadratic za bending mode plays a key role in the graphene structure at finite temperatures and we have discussed how this fact might influence the fitting of force constants models to experimental values measured at room temperature .",
    "lastly , we point out that multilayer graphene is characterized by several low frequency breathing modes at @xmath52 , that are univocally related to the number of layers and could be used for their characterization .",
