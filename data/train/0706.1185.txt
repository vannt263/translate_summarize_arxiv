    "<S> we propose in this letter a holographic model of tachyon dark energy </S>",
    "<S> . a connection between the tachyon scalar - field and the holographic dark energy is established , and accordingly , the potential of the holographic tachyon field is constructed . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the holographic evolution of the universe with @xmath0 can be described completely by the resulting tachyon model in a certain way .    </S>",
    "<S> the astronomical observations over the past decade indicate that our universe is currently undergoing an epoch of accelerated expansion ( see e.g. refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . such an accelerated expansion implies , following the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmology , the existence of a `` dark energy '' , a mysterious exotic matter with large enough negative pressure , whose energy density has been a dominative power of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> the astrophysical feature of dark energy is that it remains unclustered at all scales where gravitational clustering of baryons and nonbaryonic cold dark matter can be seen.its gravity effect is shown as a repulsive force so as to make the expansion of the universe accelerate when its energy density becomes dominative power of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> the combined analysis of cosmological observations suggests that the universe is spatially flat , and consists of about @xmath1 dark energy , @xmath2 dust matter ( cold dark matter plus baryons ) , and negligible radiation . the most obvious candidate for the dark energy </S>",
    "<S> is the cosmological constant @xmath3 @xcite for which @xmath4 ( for reviews see e.g. refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the cosmological constant always suffers from the `` fine - tuning '' and `` cosmic coincidence '' problems . </S>",
    "<S> another candidate for dark energy is the energy density associated with dynamical scalar - field , a slowly varying , spatially homogeneous component . </S>",
    "<S> an example of scalar - field dark energy is the so - called `` quintessence '' @xcite , a scalar field @xmath5 slowly evolving down its potential @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> provided that the evolution of the field is slow enough , the kinetic energy density is less than the potential energy density , giving rise to the negative pressure responsible to the cosmic acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> so far a wide variety of scalar - field dark energy models have been proposed . </S>",
    "<S> besides quintessence , these also include phantom @xcite , @xmath7-essence @xcite , tachyon @xcite , ghost condensate @xcite and quintom @xcite amongst many . </S>",
    "<S> but we should note that the mainstream viewpoint regards the scalar field dark energy models as an effective description of an underlying theory of dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , other proposals on dark energy include interacting dark energy models @xcite , braneworld models @xcite , and chaplygin gas models @xcite , etc .. one should realize , nevertheless , that almost these models are settled at the phenomenological level , lacking theoretical root .    in recent years , many string theorists have devoted to understand and shed light on the cosmological constant or dark energy within the string framework . </S>",
    "<S> the famous kachru - kallosh - linde - trivedi ( kklt ) model @xcite is a typical example , which tries to construct metastable de sitter vacua in the light of type iib string theory . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , string landscape idea @xcite has been proposed for shedding light on the cosmological constant problem based upon the anthropic principle and multiverse speculation . </S>",
    "<S> another way of endeavoring to probe the nature of dark energy within the fundamental theory framework originates from some considerations of the features of the quantum gravity theory . </S>",
    "<S> it is generally believed by theorists that we can not entirely understand the nature of dark energy before a complete theory of quantum gravity is established . however , although we are lacking a quantum gravity theory today , we still can make some attempts to probe the nature of dark energy according to some principles of quantum gravity . </S>",
    "<S> the holographic dark energy model @xcite is just an appropriate example , which is constructed in the light of the holographic principle @xcite of quantum gravity theory . </S>",
    "<S> that is to say , the holographic dark energy model possesses some significant features of an underlying theory of dark energy .    according to the holographic principle , </S>",
    "<S> the number of degrees of freedom for a system within a finite region should be finite and should be bounded roughly by the area of its boundary . in the cosmological context , the holographic principle will set an upper bound on the entropy of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by the bekenstein entropy bound , it seems plausible to require that for an effective quantum field theory in a box of size @xmath8 with uv cutoff @xmath9 , the total entropy should satisfy @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the entropy of a black hole with the same size @xmath8 . however , cohen et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite pointed out that to saturate this inequality some states with schwartzschild radius much larger than the box size have to be counted in . </S>",
    "<S> as a result , a more restrictive bound , the energy bound , has been proposed to constrain the degrees of freedom of the system , requiring that the total energy of a system with size @xmath8 should not exceed the mass of a black hole with the same size , namely , @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the maximum entropy is in order of @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> when we take the whole universe into account , the vacuum energy related to this holographic principle is viewed as dark energy , usually dubbed holographic dark energy . the largest ir cut - off @xmath8 </S>",
    "<S> is chosen by saturating the inequality so that we get the holographic dark energy density @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a numerical constant , and @xmath16 is the reduced planck mass . </S>",
    "<S> many authors have devoted to develop the idea of the holographic dark energy ( see e.g. refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> it has been conjectured by li @xcite that the ir cutoff @xmath8 should be given by the future event horizon of the universe @xmath17 such a holographic dark energy looks reasonable , since it may provide simultaneously natural solutions to both dark energy problems as demonstrated in ref.@xcite . the holographic dark energy model has been tested and constrained by various astronomical observations @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the holographic dark energy scenario reveals the dynamical nature of the vacuum energy . </S>",
    "<S> when taking the holographic principle into account , the vacuum energy density will evolve dynamically . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , let us consider another dynamical dark energy candidate , the scalar - field dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> the scalar field dark energy models are often viewed as effective description of the underlying theory of dark energy . however , the underlying theory of dark energy can not be achieved before a complete theory of quantum gravity is established . </S>",
    "<S> we can , nevertheless , speculate on the underlying theory of dark energy by taking some principles of quantum gravity into account . </S>",
    "<S> the holographic dark energy model is no doubt a tentative in this way . </S>",
    "<S> we are now interested in that if we assume the holographic vacuum energy scenario as the underlying theory of dark energy , how the scalar field model can be used to effectively describe it . in this direction </S>",
    "<S> , some work has been done . </S>",
    "<S> the issues of holographic quintessence and holographic quintom have been discussed in refs . @xcite and @xcite . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we will construct the holographic tachyon model , connecting the tachyon scalar - field with the holographic dark energy .    </S>",
    "<S> the rolling tachyon condensate in a class of string theories may have interesting cosmological consequences . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown by sen @xcite that the decay of d - branes produces a pressureless gas with finite energy density that resembles classical dust . </S>",
    "<S> a rolling tachyon has an interesting equation of state whose parameter smoothly interpolates between @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , tachyon can be viewed as a suitable candidate for the inflaton at high energy @xcite . meanwhile , the tachyon can also act as a source of dark energy depending upon the form of the tachyon potential @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we shall consider a tachyon model with definite holography nature in this letter . in </S>",
    "<S> what follows we shall construct the holographic tachyon potential according to the holographic evolution of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> the effective lagrangian for the tachyon on a non - bps d3-brane is described by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the tachyon potential . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding energy momentum tensor has the form @xmath22 in a flat frw background the energy density @xmath23 and the pressure density @xmath24 are given by @xmath25 @xmath26 the equation of state of the tachyon is consequently given by @xmath27 we see that irrespective the steepness of the tachyon potential , the equation of state varies between 0 and @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the tachyonic scalar field can not realize the equation of state crossing @xmath18 .    imposing the holographic nature to the tachyon </S>",
    "<S> , the energy density of tachyon is needed to satisfy the requirement of holographic principle , i.e. , we should identify @xmath23 with @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> it is remarkable that here the condition @xmath29 is needed as will be discussed below . </S>",
    "<S> consider a universe filled with matter component @xmath30 ( including both baryon matter and cold dark matter ) and holographic tachyon component @xmath31 , the friedmann equation reads @xmath32 or equivalently , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the redshift of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> note that we always assume spatial flatness throughout this letter as motivated by inflation . </S>",
    "<S> combining the definition of the holographic dark energy ( [ de ] ) and the definition of the future event horizon ( [ eh ] ) , we derive @xmath35 we notice that the friedmann equation ( [ ez ] ) implies @xmath36 substituting ( [ fri ] ) into ( [ rh ] ) , one obtains the following equation @xmath37 where @xmath38 . then taking derivative with respect to @xmath39 in both sides of the above relation , we get easily the dynamics satisfied by the dark energy , i.e. the differential equation about the fractional density of dark energy , @xmath40 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the redshift @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> this equation describes behavior of the holographic dark energy completely , and it can be solved exactly @xcite . from the energy conservation equation of the dark energy , the equation of state of the dark energy can be given @xmath42 note that the formula @xmath43 and the differential equation of @xmath44 ( [ deq ] ) are used in the second equal sign . </S>",
    "<S> using eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rhot ] ) , ( [ wt ] ) and ( [ ez ] ) , we derive the holographic tachyon potential @xmath45 where @xmath44 and @xmath46 are given by eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ deq ] ) and ( [ w ] ) , @xmath47 is today s critical density of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , using eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ wt ] ) and ( [ ez ] ) , the derivative of the holographic tachyon scalar - field @xmath48 with respect to the redshift @xmath41 can be given @xmath49 where the sign is actually arbitrary since it can be changed by a redefinition of the field , @xmath50 . </S>",

    "<S> thus , the parameter @xmath15 plays a significant role in the holographic evolution of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath59 , the holographic evolution will make the equation of state cross @xmath4 ( from @xmath60 evolves to @xmath61 ) ; when @xmath0 , the equation of state will evolve in the region of @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> since the equation of state of tachyon scalar - field evolves within the range of @xmath63 , only the holographic evolution of cases @xmath0 can be described by the tachyon . </S>",
