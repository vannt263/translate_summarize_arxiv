    "the searches from atlas @xcite , cms @xcite , and cdf @xcite as well as d0 @xcite established that there is a new particle around @xmath5 gev whose decay pattern is consistent with the predicted higgs boson of the standard model ( sm ) . if this new particle is a fundamental higgs boson , it is reasonable to ask whether it is the predicted light cp - even higgs boson in the supersymmetric models .",

    ", the tree - level mass of the lighter cp - even higgs boson should always be smaller than the mass of z boson , while the loop effects of stop can lift the higgs boson mass up to 130 gev or so . in order to avoid a fine - tuning problem , natural supersymmetry ( susy )",

    ", a higgs boson at @xmath6 gev can be realized more naturally next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) without confronting the severe fine - tuning problem , since it can have a much larger tree - level higgs mass .",
    "this might be one of the reasons why the nmssm is appealing except that it solves the notorious @xmath7 problem in the mssm . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors studied the constrained nmssm with all parameters defined at the grand unification scale .",
    "it is found that the tension of the constrained mssm for a 125 gev higgs boson mass and a light susy mass spectrum can be relaxed in the nmssm with more general parameters .",
    "another reason that may favor the nmssm is the higgs decay mode .",
    "the experimental data of the higgs boson decay modes have shown a possible excess in the diphoton channel .",
    "this may be a hint of new physics @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , it is shown that the nmssm can accommodate the 125 gev higgs and enhance the partial width of @xmath8 by reducing the partial width of @xmath9 via the mixing effect .",
    "a comprehensive study considering light third generation sparticles in the nmssm also found that the diphoton decay branching fraction can be enhanced @xcite .",
    "moreover , light charged sparticles such as stops , staus , charginos , and charged higgs may also significantly contribute to the higgs diphoton decay channel @xcite .",
    "more studies on diphoton enhancement in both the mssm and nmssm contexts can be found in @xcite .",
    "the lhc is extensively searching for susy particles in various channels .",
    "up to now , the null result puts tension to many susy models . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is found that the lhc sparticle search with 1 fb@xmath10 at @xmath11 tev exacerbated the tension between the @xmath12 anomaly and the branching fraction @xmath13 in the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( cmssm ) .",
    "of course , such conclusion is based on the assumed grand unified theory ( gut ) relations among the soft breaking terms .",
    "when such relations are released as demonstrated in @xcite , the conclusion can be relaxed . for the pmssm with 19-dimensional parameter space ,",
    "the current lhc search can not put very restrict constraints on supersymmetry in general .",
    "the lhc direct susy searches have set strong constraints on the masses of gluino and the first two generations of squarks in msugra and some simplified models @xcite .",
    "recently , there are many works on the detection of light third generation squarks and gluinos below 1 tev .",
    "it is pointed out that if the stop is light , it can be hidden from the lhc searches and can avoid severe lhc constraints @xcite .",
    "therefore the natural susy scenario is still alive .",
    "more studies @xcite are trying to improve the sensitivity of light stop searches .",
    "for example , in @xcite , the authors considered the stop dileptonic final state and explored a few kinematic observables to distinguish signal and background .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite studied the top tagging technique for the stop search with semileptonic and dileptonic modes at the lhc .",
    "the hadronic top tagging technique has been examined in ref .",
    "interesting multiple lepton and jet final states from the multiple top decays are investigated in @xcite . moreover ,",
    "light sbottom searches are investigated in @xcite .",
    "in particular , the sbottom - neutralino coannihilation scenario has been considered , and it was found that the lhc has a good sensitivity to the parameter space by using tagged a b - jet even for small mass splitting between the sbottom and neutralino .",
    "since in the nmssm the light stop and sbottom can be natural for a 125 gev higgs boson @xcite , we perform a systematic study on the constraints on the light stop / sbottom scenario by using the lhc susy search results .",
    "the constraints from b physics measurements and dark matter ( dm ) detections as well as the higgs boson mass on the nmssm parameter space are first considered ( for more studies on the constraints on the light stop / sbottom scenario , see @xcite )",
    ". then we study the constraints from various susy search channels at the lhc with @xmath11 tev and @xmath14 fb@xmath10 of data , including the jets + met channel , associated monojet channel , and lepton + jets + met channel with and without tagged b jet(s ) .",
    "since both stops and sbottoms can decay into b jets , it is expected that b tagging should play an important role to distinguish the signal and background .",
    "our results confirm this point and find that the direct susy searches are powerful to exclude many parameter points with light stops and sbottoms up to 500 gev .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly describe the nmssm and our parameter scanning strategy .",
    "we will concentrate on the contribution of the light stop to the mass of the discovered 125 gev higgs boson and the constraints from dark matter searches on the neutralino sector . in sec .",

    "the main decay modes of light stops in these two benchmark points are @xmath504 and @xmath512 with branching fractions @xmath513 and @xmath514 ( @xmath515 and @xmath516 ) . in these benchmark points , compared with the mssm case , the branching fractions of @xmath517 and @xmath518 can be suppressed drastically if @xmath2 is singlino dominant . such a fact leads to weaker constraints when we apply the lhc direct searches to parameter spaces with lighter stops and sbottoms .",
    "the nmssm provides a natural framework for the recently discovered 125 gev higgs boson . within the nmssm",
    ", we have analyzed the constraints from the 125 gev higgs boson as well as the results from the dark matter searches to the parameter space .",
    "we concentrate on the lhc direct susy searches on the allowed parameter points .",
    "we have focused on a scenario where the stop / sbottom can be lighter than 500 gev and performed a detailed study to examine how the susy direct search can constrain them by using the results based on @xmath5197 tev and @xmath520 fb@xmath10 of data .",
    "it is found that the direct susy searches , especially the channels with tagged b jets , are powerful and can put bounds to the allowed parameter space .",
    "we would like to point out that when the inclusive signatures of both stop and sbottom pair productions are considered , the direct susy searches can exclude many parameter points with the left - handed stop / sbottom up to 500 gev or so . with @xmath5198 tev and 5 fb@xmath10 of data or more , although the kinematics could be a little different , we can expect the direct susy searches will push the light third generation squarks of nmssm to narrower corners . however , for the benchmark points given in our work and refs .",
    "@xcite , special strategies and kinematic variables are still needed for searching light stop / sbottom pair signatures .",

    "<S> in this work , we study the constraints on the scenario of light stops and sbottoms in the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) , especially by a 125 gev higgs boson discovery and the lhc bounds on supersymmetry . the constraints from dark matter detections are also taken into account . from the parameter scan , we find that the nmssm can well accommodate a light higgs boson around 125 gev and decay patterns . </S>",
    "<S> we would like to stress that the lhc direct supersymmetry searches with b - tagging are very powerful and can set strong bounds on many nmssm parameter points with light stops and sbottoms . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath0 is a very promising channel for light stop detection if the mass splitting between @xmath1 and @xmath2 is very small . </S>",
    "<S> it is also pointed out that in order to close the parameter space of light stops and sbottoms , new search strategies for signal channels such as @xmath3 and @xmath4 may be necessary . </S>"
