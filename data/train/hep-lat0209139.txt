    "it is expected that the hadronic excitation modes strongly change their properties around the qcd phase transition .",
    "such changes of hadron properties may signal the occurrence of phase transition in heavy ion collision experiments . with the potential model approach",
    ", it has been expected that the charmonium masses are shifted in the vicinity of @xmath4 @xcite . in the plasma phase , they are expected to dissolve , and resultant suppression of @xmath5 formation has been regarded as one of most important signals of plasma formation @xcite . therefore it is important to verify these phenomena using lattice qcd in a model independent way .    in principle , information of excitation modes can be extracted from the matsubara green function in the euclidean time direction . in practice , however , there are several problems at finite temperature .",
    "one problem is that the degrees of freedom is restricted by the short temporal extent . to avoid this difficulty",
    ", we use an anisotropic lattice , on which temporal lattice spacing is finer than the spatial one .",
    "the other problem is that one need to extract the low energy structure from the correlator at the region of @xmath6 , where the correlator contains contribution from wide range of frequency of the spectral function .",
    "we circumvent this problem by applying the smearing technique , which enhances the low energy part of the correlator .    in order to extract a reliable information on the spectral function , we suggest to use maximum entropy method ( mem ) @xcite and @xmath0 fit method in a complementary manner .",
    "the former has an advantage that it does not require to assume specific form for the spectral function .",
    "once the form of spectral function is estimated , however , the latter approach is more quantitative for evaluation of properties of the mode , such as mass and width .",
    "we first discuss how the applicability of these procedures to finite temperatures is justified using correlators at @xmath2 by varying numbers of degrees of freedom used in analyses .",
    "then we discuss changes of spectral function below and above @xmath4 .",
    "details of this work will be presented in future publication .",
    "we use quenched lattices of the sizes @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , 32 , and 26 which roughly correspond to @xmath9 , 0.9@xmath4 , and 1.1@xmath4 , respectively . the zero temperature lattice , and the setup of lattice parameters are the same as those used in ref .",
    "the gauge configurations are generated with the wilson plaquette action at @xmath10 with the anisotropy @xmath11 .",
    "the spatial cutoff set by the hadronic radius @xmath12 is @xmath13 gev .",
    "@xmath14 is close to the phase transition .",
    "the quark action is the @xmath15 improved wilson action @xcite , with the hopping parameter corresponding to the quark mass @xmath16 gev .",
    "the correlator is represented as @xmath17 the operator @xmath18 is @xmath19 where @xmath20 matrix @xmath21 specifies the quantum number and @xmath22 is the smearing function for which we use the wave function observed at @xmath2 .",
    "the correlators are measured on 500 configurations at @xmath2 and 1000 configurations at @xmath23 . in order to reduce the statistical error ,",
    "we average 16 correlators measured with different source points on each configuration .",
    "we focus on the low energy structure of the spectral function .",
    "we use two types of analysis method : the maximum entropy method ( mem ) , and the standard @xmath0 fit with ansatz for the shape of spectral function @xmath24 .",
    "mem has an advantage that it does not require to assume a specific form for the spectral function .",
    "when the number of temporal points is sufficiently large , and the data region is also in sufficiently long distance , mem can reproduce the spectral function successfully @xcite .",
    "however , when the number of temporal points is small , the extracted spectral function has a large uncertainty quantitatively , and sometimes even qualitatively . on the other hand ,",
    "once a rough estimate of shape of the spectral function is in hand , @xmath0 fit gives more quantitative result for the parameters of assumed form .",
    "therefore , complementary use of these methods are preferable for justification of their applicability and quantitative analysis .",
    "we use mem for rough estimation of a shape of spectral function , and @xmath0 fit for more quantitative analysis .    in mem analysis",
    "we test several values of @xmath25 for the default model function , @xmath26 , and fitting ranges @xmath27 $ ] , where @xmath28 is fixed . for the @xmath0 fit , we adopt two forms for each peak of spectral function : @xmath29 function ( denoted as _ pole _ ) form , and the relativistic breit - wigner ( _ bw _ ) form , @xmath30 combining them , we apply _ 2-pole _ ,",

    "bottom panel is the result of mem at @xmath34.,title=\"fig:\",width=238 ]    in the following , we show only the result for the vector channel , while similar result is observed for the pseudoscalar channel . in order for mem works at @xmath35 , it should produce at @xmath2 a structure which is stable under the change of fitting range , @xmath36 .",
    "we regard this as a necessary condition for applicability of mem to problems at @xmath35 .",
    "figure  [ fig : zero_temp ] shows the result of mem at @xmath2 with several values of @xmath36 .",
    "the position of peak corresponding to the ground state is stable , while the width becomes broader for smaller @xmath36 .",
    "although the position of the first excited state changes with @xmath36 , we do not consider this seriously , since we are interested only in the ground state , and the contribution of excited states are small owing to the smearing of operator .",
    "therefore , using only restricted numbers of points , which are inevitable at @xmath35 , mem can produce a consistent result with the case of sufficiently large @xmath36 , at least for a rough estimate of lowest peak structure .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of a correlator of local operators , for which our mem analysis does not produce a stable result under the same change of @xmath36 .",
    "the correlator is well fitted to the 2-pole form , and both 1-bw and bw+pole fits give the values of width @xmath37 consistent with zero .",
    "now we turn to the study of spectral function at @xmath23 . at @xmath38",
    ", mem gives a similar result as @xmath2 case .",
    "the bw+pole fit gives almost the same mass as at @xmath2 , and small value of width ( top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ft ] ) .",
    "since this is the most general fit form , we conclude that at @xmath39 , the ground state has almost the same mass as at @xmath2 and almost vanishing width .",
    "the other fits support this conclusion .",
    "the 2-pole fit is rather well applied , while the obtained mass of the ground state slightly decreases as increasing @xmath40 .",
    "the result of 1-bw fit approaches to the consistent value with bw+pole fit as @xmath40 increases .",
    "the result of mem at @xmath41 is displayed in fig .  2 ( bottom ) .",
    "although the width is larger than @xmath42 , the result still exhibits a peak structure around the same energy region as at @xmath42 .",
    "therefore we perform the same types of fit analysis as at @xmath42 .",
    "the 2-pole fit and bw type fits give inconsistent results , and the latter fits indicate that the spectral function has a peak with almost the same mass at @xmath42 and the width of order of 200 mev , as shown in fig .  2 ( top ) .",
    "this result indicate that the charmonium correlator may still have a nontrivial structure slightly above @xmath4 @xcite . in this analysis",
    ", we use specific smearing function . in order to verify that the observed spectral function is not an artifact @xcite , comparative study with different smearing function is necessary , which is now underway ."
