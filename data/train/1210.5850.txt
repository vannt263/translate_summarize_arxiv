    "low - frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( lf - qpos ) have been observed in the x - ray light curves of most low - mass x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "their frequencies are typically @xmath0170 hz for neutron - star low - mass x - ray binaries ( ns - lmxbs ) and @xmath00.0130 hz for black - hole low - mass x - ray binaries ( bh - lmxbs ) .",
    "despite having been known for more than 25 years , their origin is still not well understood .",
    "however , similarities between the lf - qpos in ns- and bh - lmxbs suggest that they have a common origin in the inner accretion flow around the compact object @xcite ; these similarities are most obvious between the so - called type - c qpos in bh - lmxbs @xcite , the horizontal branch oscillations in z - type ns - lmxbs and the `` low - frequency qpo '' in atoll - type lmxbs @xcite .",
    "hereafter , `` lf - qpo '' will be referring to these specific types of lf - qpos in lmxbs .",
    "these lf - qpos are all accompanied by a peaked noise component at frequencies that are typically less than one decade lower than that of the qpo .",
    "both the lf - qpos and the accompanying noise are typically seen in intermediate spectral states .    among the most promising models for lf - qpos",
    "are the ones that invoke lense - thirring precession .",
    "this is a relativistic effect that occurs as the result of the dragging of inertial frames around a spinning compact object , when the rotation axis of a particle orbit is inclined with respect to the spin axis of the compact object @xcite .",
    "@xcite were the first to suggest lense - thirring precession as an explanation for the lf - qpos in ns - lmxbs ; @xcite also applied the model to lf - qpos in bh - lmxbs .",
    "initial work on these models focussed on reproducing the observed qpo frequencies and only considered motion of particles or `` blobs '' along infinitesimally perturbed orbits , but no clear mechanism was proposed that could explain the actual modulations in the x - ray flux .",
    "simulations by @xcite of a tilted precessing ring of gas around a spinning black hole show that such modulations can naturally arise from relativistic doppler and light bending effects , without relying on the existence of inhomogeneities in the accretion flow . however , substantial misalignment angles ( 15 - 20@xmath1 ) between the compact object s spin axis and the rotational axis of the ring are needed to reproduce the observed qpo amplitudes",
    ". recent work by @xcite and @xcite describes the lense - thirring precession of a geometrically thick inner accretion flow .",
    "these authors also require a substantial misalignment ( @xmath015@xmath1 ) in order to get a density profile that results in qpo frequencies that match the observed ones ; without such a misalignment , the predicted frequencies are too high and the dependence on the spin of the compact object is too strong .",
    "a problem to these precession models is presented by recently discovered 3550 hz qpos in an accreting 11 hz pulsar @xcite .",
    "these frequencies are too high ( by factors of at least 40 ) for lense - thirring precession in such a slowly spinning source .",
    "the strong similarity of these qpos to the horizontal branch oscillations in the z sources casts doubt on the lense - thirring interpretation of that type of lf - qpos and , by extension , the lf - qpos in atoll sources and bh - lmxbs as well .",
    "the large misalignment angles that are required in the precession models described above may be problematic as well : it is not clear if such angles can be maintained for a long enough period .",
    "@xcite showed that a misaligned thin disc should gradually align itself with a black hole at small radii .",
    "@xcite performed simulations of a thick flow around a spinning black hole ( similar to that used by @xcite ) , incorporating the effects of the black hole space - time as well as magnetorotational turbulence .",
    "they find no indications for the bardeen - petterson effect , suggesting that misaligned inner accretions flows may persists for long times . in this letter",
    "i present observational evidence in support of misaligned inner accretion flows in dipping / eclipsing ns - lmxbs .",
    "the large misalignment angles required to reproduce the observed lf - qpo amplitudes and frequencies have a potentially observable consequence that has not been discussed in previous works : if the inclination angle of a source is within a certain range , part of the titled and precessing ( thick ) inner accretion flow could quasi - periodically intercept the line of sight between an observer and the central compact object . for a misalignment angle @xmath2 this",
    "is expected to happen in sources that are viewed at inclination angles that are larger than @xmath3 ; for @xmath4 @xcite this means inclination angles larger than @xmath5 . given the absence of a solid surface in bh - lmxbs , the movement of the precessing disk through our line of sight should not result in substantial flux modulation of the compact object itself in those sources , although , as pointed out by @xcite , self - occultation of the disk may occur .",
    "however , for ns - lxmbs , where up to half of the accretion energy is released on the neutron star surface or in the boundary layer , substantial modulations will arise when the precessing disk moves through our line of sight .    as i discuss below , evidence for such modulations has been seen in a number of dipping and/or eclipsing ns - lmxbs .",
    "the dips and eclipses in the x - ray light curves of these sources are the result of absorption by extended features in the outer accretion disk and obscuration by the companion star , respectively .",
    "dips are typically seen in sources with inclination angles @xmath6 , whereas full ( i.e.  not partial ) eclipses are seen in sources with inclination angles between 75@xmath1 and 80@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "these sources are therefore expected to show the effects of the inner accretion disk moving through our line of sight to the compact object if the misalignment angle @xmath2 is indeed on the order of @xmath7 .",
    "the first dipping ns - lmxb in which clear evidence was found for modulations of the neutron - star emission is xb 1323619 .",
    "@xcite discovered a 0.770.87 hz qpo in data obtained with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _ , with an amplitude that was found to be consistent with being constant during the persistent emission , x - ray dips , and , most importantly , type i x - ray bursts ( which are the result of thermonuclear burning on the neutron - star surface ) . unlike lf - qpos in non - dipping / eclipsing ns - lxmbs , the fractional rms amplitude of this qpo depended only weakly on energy .",
    "based on these properties @xcite concluded that the qpo was caused by quasi - periodic obscuration of the central x - ray source by a structure in or on the accretion disk .",
    "the fact that the @xmath01 hz qpos persist throughout dips with nearly constant rms amplitudes indicates that they are formed at a radius smaller than the radius at which the dipping structures are located .",
    "soon after , a qpo with similar properties was found in the dipping / eclipsing ns - lmxb exo 0748676 by @xcite .",
    "the frequency of this qpo was found to be more variable ( 0.582.44 hz ) , but otherwise its properties were remarkably similar . despite the observed frequency range , i will refer to this type of qpo as the `` @xmath01 hz qpo '' throughout the remainder of this letter , to set it apart from the lf - qpos in the non - dipping / eclipsing ns - lmxbs .",
    "an example of a @xmath01 hz qpo from exo 0748 - 676 is shown in figure [ fig : pds]b . the only observation in which @xcite did not find the @xmath01 hz qpo had a count rate 23 times higher than the other observations in their data set .",
    "analysis of a larger data set by @xcite increased the frequency range to 0.43 hz and also made it clear that the observation without the @xmath01 hz qpo corresponded to the spectrally soft state , whereas the observations with @xmath01 hz qpos were all in spectrally harder states .",
    "a preliminary inspection of more recent exo 0748676 data reveals @xmath01 hz qpos up to at least 15 hz .",

    "also , like in exo 0748 - 676 , a clear dependence on spectral state was observed ; the qpo was only found in the spectrally hard state and was not detected in the spectrally soft state .",
    "in addition to the three sources discussed above , there are eight other dipping and/or eclipsing ns - lmxbs that have been observed extensively with _ rxte _ ( with total exposure times ranging from @xmath0135 ks to @xmath0660 ks ) .",
    "these sources are listed in table [ tab : sources ] . @xmath01",
    "hz qpos have been found in three of these sources : in 1a 1744361 @xcite , where it was only seen in the hard state , exo 1745248 ( altamirano et al .",

    "the corresponding light curve of this observation is shown in figure [ fig : burst ] ; the @xmath00.4 hz qpo can clearly be seen in the light curve , both in the persistent and in the burst emission .",
    "hints of @xmath01 hz qpos were also seen in a preliminary analysis of data of xte j1710281 . in 4u 162449 @xcite and",
    "xb 1254690 @xcite no @xmath9 hz qpos ( or lf - qpos ) were observed ; both sources were only found in the soft state .",
    "@xcite report on qpos between 5 and 80 hz in the dipping ns - lmxb 4u 1915 - 05 , but it is not clear if these qpos have similarities to the @xmath01 hz qpo in the other dipping / eclipsing sources .",
    "i was not able to find rapid variability studies of the eclipsing ns - lmxb mxb 1659298 .",
    "a summary of @xmath01 hz qpo detections is given in table [ tab : sources ] .",
    "the @xmath01 hz qpos detected in dipping / eclipsing ns - lmxbs satisfy one of the implicit predictions of the latest versions of the lense - thirring precession models for lf - qpos ; they are caused by matter moving through our line of sight to the neutron star .",
    "this latter property is deduced from the fact that the strength of the @xmath01 hz qpos remains more - or - less constant during type i x - ray bursts , as can be seen in figure [ fig : burst ] , for example .",
    "the fact that the @xmath01 hz qpos are only detected in dipping / eclipsing sources ( i.e. sources that are seen at viewing angles larger than @xmath060@xmath1 ) falls in line with the misalignment angles of @xmath01520@xmath1 that are implied by the work of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the frequency of the @xmath01 hz qpos was originally interpreted as being keplerian by @xcite and @xcite . for the @xmath00.415 hz range seen in exo",
    "0748676 this would correspond to radii of @xmath10@xmath11 cm ( assuming a 1.4 @xmath12 ns ) .",
    "however , it is not clear what type of obscuring structures might exist at such radii that could cause the @xmath01 hz qpos . in the lense - thirring precession interpretation ,",
    "the radius at which the modulation of the neutron - star emission occurs is much smaller . using the lense - thirring precession frequency equations from @xcite , and assuming a neutron - star spin of 552 hz @xcite , a mass of 1.4 @xmath12 , and a moment of inertia of @xmath13 g@xmath14",
    ", we find typical radii of @xmath15@xmath16 cm for exo 0748676 .",
    "the corresponding range for keplerian frequencies at those radii is @xmath0150930 hz , which largely overlaps with the range of upper khz qpo frequencies ( often interpreted as keplerian ) reported for ns - lmxbs @xcite .",
    "an important property of the @xmath01 hz qpos is their very weak energy dependence .",
    "this sets them apart from the lf - qpos seen in ns - lmxbs and bh - lmxbs , which generally increase in strength with energy .",
    "this weak energy dependence could easily be produced by ( partial ) obscuration of the central x - ray source by an opaque medium , such as an optically thick accretion disk .",
    "however , the part of the flow that is intercepting our line of sight to the central x - ray source in the geometrical model of @xcite is assumed to be a translucent ( @xmath17 ) comptonizing medium , rather than an optically thick medium .",
    "still , most of the photons from the central x - ray source that will interact with the comptonizing medium will be scattered out of our line of sight , and , since the chance of scattering ( set by the thomson scattering cross section ) is independent of photon energy , the resulting modulation will not have a strong energy dependence .    in the framework of the lense - thirring precession models , both the lf - qpos and the @xmath01 hz qpos in ns - lmxbs could be the result of the same precession mechanism . for sources with inclinations less than @xmath060@xmath1 modulations in the x - ray flux would be the result of relativistic beaming and light bending effects @xcite , whereas for sources with higher inclinations the modulations would be the result of obscuration of the central x - ray source .",
    "so , while the frequency of the two types of qpos is set by the ( same ) precession frequency , the actual modulation mechanism would depend on the viewing angle .",
    "it is therefore interesting to see how the properties of the @xmath01 hz qpos compare with those of the lf - qpos , also in light of the recent findings by @xcite .",
    "@xmath01 hz qpos are predominantly detected in the spectrally hard state , with some detections in the intermediate state .",
    "lf - qpos are , however , predominantly detected in intermediate spectra states , with occasional detections in hard and soft spectral states .",
    "lf - qpos increase in frequency as the x - ray spectrum softens . for @xmath01",
    "hz qpos this dependence has not yet been studied , but there are strong indications that the highest frequency @xmath01 hz qpos in exo 0748676 are found in the spectrally softer states than the lowest frequency ones .    in terms of qpo frequency range there is a clear discrepancy between the two types of qpos . based on their x - ray luminosity and spectra , the dipping /",
    "eclipsing ns - lmxbs are almost all atoll - type sources that spend most of their time in the spectrally hard and intermediate states .",
    "the frequency ranges for lf - qpos in atoll sources are typically @xmath0550 hz @xcite , whereas @xmath01 hz qpos have been found in the @xmath00.415 hz range .",
    "it is not clear what could cause such discrepancy , if both types of qpos were to be the result of the same precession mechanism .",
    "perhaps the modulation mechanism of the @xmath01 hz qpos is only effective at the lowest precession frequencies , when the precessing part of the inner accretion flow is assumed to have its largest extent .",
    "this is supposed to occur in the hardest spectral states , where typically no clear indications of narrow lf - qpos are seen @xcite .",
    "although previous works on the @xmath01 hz qpos in the dipping / eclipsing sources only reported power - law noise components in addition to the qpo , 256 s segments were used . also , in the case of exo 0748676 , which has very low count rates ( @xmath024 countss@xmath18pcu@xmath18 ) , a relatively large amount of data ( @xmath040 ks ) had to be combined for the peaked noise to show up significantly . ]",
    "they are in fact accompanied by peaked noise as well , as can been from figure [ fig : pds ] .",
    "this is a characteristic they share with lf - qpos .",
    "however , plotting the frequencies of the qpos and the ( lowest frequency ) noise components from figure [ fig : pds ] against each other , we find that the @xmath01 hz qpos fall well below the relation traced out by the lf - qpos in the work of @xcite , by factors of 510 in qpo frequency .    clearly , there are substantial differences between the two types of qpos .",
    "it is not clear how these might be related to differences in viewing angle . observing @xmath01",
    "hz qpos and lf - qpos simultaneously ( at different frequencies ) would indicate that the two types of qpos are _ not _ the result of the same precession mechanism , since the inner accretion flow is assumed to be precessing as a solid body , with a single frequency @xcite .",
    "however , published works on the @xmath01 hz qpos indicate that , except for occasional higher harmonics ( see figure [ fig : pds]a ) , the @xmath01 hz qpos are not accompanied by ( other ) lf - qpos .    as discussed in section [ sec : intro ] , the lense - thirring precession models of @xcite and @xcite require large misalignment angles between the inner accretion disk and the neutron star spin axis .",
    "in the presence of accretion , a low - magnetic field neutron star should have its spin axis aligned with that of the binary orbit , leaving no obvious misalignment angle between inner disk and neutron star .",
    "there are several effects that may result in such a misalignment .",
    "@xcite showed that the strong radiation field from the central x - ray source can induce warps in the accretion disk .",
    "however , this happens only at relatively large radii ( @xmath19 cm ) .",
    "a more promising source of misalignment could be magnetically driven disc warping , in which the weak ( @xmath20 g ) tilted magnetic field of the neutron star induces a disk tilt @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xcite provide a detailed discussion of how such magnetically driven warps could lead to lense - thirring precession in ns - lmxbs .",
    "the @xmath01 hz qpos observed in dipping / eclipsing ns - lmxbs are caused by parts of the accretion flow that intercept our line of sight to the neutron star .",
    "the fact that these qpos are only seen in dipping and/or eclipsing ns - lmxbs suggests that the material must have a high angular extent ( @xmath0@xmath21 ) above the plane of the binary orbit .",
    "such angles are close to the misalignment angles of 1520@xmath1 between inner disk and neutron star , required by the most recent lense - thirring precession models for lf - qpos . the properties of the @xmath01 hz qpos suggest that misaligned inner accretion flows are possible in ns - lmxbs , despite doubts that have been raised in the past .",
    "it is unclear , however , if the @xmath01 hz qpos and lf - qpos are the result of the same precession mechanism .",
    "an inspection of all _ rxte _ observations of the dipping / eclipsing ns - lmxbs will allow for a better comparison of the properties of the two types of qpos .",
