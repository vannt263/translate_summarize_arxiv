    "current viable screening mechanisms generally fall into two classes :    * the chameleon  like mechanism , in which the self  interactions of the scalar field are regulated by a potential @xmath14  @xcite .",

    "the maximum force enhancement is @xmath28 times the normal gravity , but the `` fifth force '' that produces this enhancement has different ranges in the two models .",
    "since the chameleon scalar field becomes yukawa  screened , the fifth force does not have infinite range , i.e. , it can not reach to cosmological scales .",
    "galileons , however , are never massive , so their force has an infinite range , thus having a much larger impact on linear perturbation theory than chameleons do . in the local universe , however , the chameleon screening predicts a richer set of observational signatures that are detectable with astrophysical tests , because it is possible to have order unity violation of the macroscopic weak equivalence principle  ( wep ) , i.e. , extended objects do not fall at the same rate as in gr  @xcite . in environments of low background @xmath15 , objects with deep gravitational potential can self ",

    "although the zw13 method is calibrated against gr simulations , we will show that the gik model is also an excellent description of the infall behavior in mg simulations .",
    "studies have shown that the peculiar velocities are more distinctively affected by modifications to gravity than the matter density field alone  @xcite , and we expect the gik to be a particularly acute test of mg theories and their screening mechanisms .",
    "a virtue of using galaxy dynamics in the outskirts of clusters is that independent information on the average cluster mass profiles can be robustly extracted from stacked weak lensing  ( wl ) experiments  @xcite .",
    "since photons do _ not _ respond to the extra scalar field , lensing mass estimates will be different from dynamical mass estimates if gravity is modified from gr on relevant scales  @xcite .",
    "however , implementing this test requires measuring mass profiles on scales where screening is inefficient , i.e. , the cluster infall region rather than within the virial radius . for any given cluster sample detected by imaging , x - ray , or sunyaev-zeldovich  ( sz ) experiments , one can",
    "either directly compare the average lensing mass and the gik  estimated dynamical mass or search for inconsistency between the measured @xmath10 and the gik  predicted @xmath10 using lensing mass estimates and assuming @xmath13+gr .",

    "the evolution of structure is the same in the three universes up to epochs around @xmath67 , which is the starting time of the simulations , since the fifth force in @xmath0 gravity is vastly suppressed until then . by studying the time evolution of the matter and velocity divergence power spectra in @xmath0 , @xcite showed that different @xmath0 models are in different stages of the same evolutionary path at any given time , and that varying the model parameter @xmath56 mainly varies the epoch marking the onset of the fifth force .",
    "the exact epoch of onset in each model depends on the scale of interest , i.e. , at higher redshift for smaller scales  ( see figure 8 in * ? ? ?",

    "the shaded region  ( @xmath68 ) indicates the mass range where the halo catalogs are incomplete and the bumps in the shaded area of the bottom panel are likely due to numerical effects . although sub  halos were included in the halo catalogs , at @xmath69 the halo mass functions are mostly contributed by main halos .",
    "the two @xmath0 models predict very similar halo abundances below @xmath70 , enhanced by @xmath71 over the gr abundances . for halos in this mass range ,",
    "the fifth force was activated early enough that the structure formation has somehow converged in the two @xmath0 models . however , on the high  mass end , the halo mass function in the f4 model shows even stronger enhancement over gr , while in the f5 model the number of halos becomes closer to the @xmath13 prediction with increasing mass .",
    "the divergence of the halo mass functions predicted by the two @xmath0 models beyond @xmath72 indicates that the fifth force only started affecting the formation of massive clusters recently in the f5 model , producing smaller enhancement in the halo abundance compared to f4 .",
    "for some very massive clusters in the f5 model  ( e.g. , see figure 3 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the gravitational potential has begun to dominate the background scalaron , activating the chameleon mechanism to recover gr in the infall region , while in the f4 model the chameleon screening likely never activates anywhere in the universe .",
    "figure  [ fig : mf ] is in good agreement with the study of  @xcite , where a series of smaller but higher resolution @xmath0 simulations are employed .",
    "@xcite modeled the halo mass functions measured from the same sets of @xmath0 simulations using environment and mass  dependent spherical collapse model in combination with excursion set theory .    with neither",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the minimum required mass threshold for a complete halo sample in the chameleon simulations , @xmath73 , is overly high for any meaningful hod  galaxies similar to the milky way and m31 would be absent .",
    "therefore , we simply use particles and halos as our proxies for galaxies in the paper , and the behavior of hod galaxies should be intermediate between that of the `` particle '' galaxies and `` halo '' galaxies . since we are focused on the relative behavior of mg and gr simulations , the impact of choices for galaxy proxy on our conclusions should be small . we will usually refer simply to `` galaxies '' , when it is clear from context whether we are using particles or halos as our proxies .    before",
    "going into the statistical properties of galaxy infall , we hope to gain some intuitive understanding of the differences in infall between mg and gr by looking at figure  [ fig : vflow ] .",
    "taking advantage of the same initial condition shared by the @xmath0 and gr simulations , we locate at the frame center two primary clusters  ( @xmath74 ) at @xmath5 that formed from the same seed in the initial density fluctuation field in the f4  ( red , for which the fifth force is stronger ) and gr  ( gray ) simulations , respectively , and plot all halos with mass above @xmath75 as circles , with their relative velocities to the primary cluster indicated by the arrows .",
    "the dark matter density field in the gr simulation is illustrated by the grayscale background , highlighting the three filamentary structures that funnel the infalling halos .",
    "the radius of each circle is proportional to the halo mass , with the thick ones representing halos more massive than @xmath76 .",
    "the length of each arrow is @xmath77 , corresponding to the redshift  space displacement  ( in units of @xmath78 ) that would be seen by a distant observer aligned with the velocity vector .",
    "figure  [ fig : vflow ] shows that the gik around _ individual _",
    "clusters is highly anisotropic , and while the difference in the spatial distribution between gr and f4 halos is irregular and fairly mild , it is somewhat enhanced in redshift space . to avoid clutter ,",
    "we do not show halos from the f5 model , which should display smaller differences from gr because of its smaller impact from the fifth force . in the next section",
    ", we will show that by stacking individual frames like figure  [ fig : vflow ] for clusters of similar mass , the anisotropy goes away and the average infall kinematics can be well described by the gik model proposed in zw13 , for both the @xmath0 and @xmath13 models .",
    "more importantly , the enhanced difference in the redshift space between mg and gr models can be captured by systematic differences in the parameters of the gik model , namely , the characteristic infall velocity @xmath31 , the radial velocity dispersion @xmath79 , and the tangential velocity dispersion @xmath80 .",
    "the halo mass functions in figure  [ fig : mf ] suggest that the fifth force became unscreened earlier in f4 than in f5 , which gives it more time to affect the velocity field in the former . as a result , at @xmath5 clusters in both the f4 and f5 models should exhibit more enhanced galaxy infall compared to gr , but we expect the enhancement to be more substantial in the f4 model . for",
    "the small number of screened clusters in the f5 model , the infalling galaxies around chameleon clusters should feel similar instantaneous accelerations as their counterparts around similar clusters in gr . however , the peculiar velocities of galaxies were enhanced by the fifth force when they were further away from the clusters . by the time they reached to the screened region ,",
    "the peculiar velocities were already higher , so the infall stays stronger even though the underlying gravity recovers to gr .",
    "our goal here is to quantify this modification to galaxy infall induced by @xmath0 gravities as function of @xmath56 within the framework of gik modelling .    to compare the average gik among the three simulations , we select dark matter halos with @xmath81 in the @xmath13 simulation as our fiducial gr cluster sample , and those with the same mass range in the @xmath0 simulations as the `` equal  mass ''  ( em ) cluster samples .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we also select specific halo samples in the @xmath0 simulations to have the same rank  order in mass as the fiducial gr clusters , i.e. , the `` equal  rank ''  ( er ) cluster samples . the er clusters generally have slightly larger masses than the em ones , with @xmath82 and @xmath83 in f5 and f4 models , respectively .",
    "the er sample thus resembles the set of clusters that formed from the same initial density peaks as the fiducial gr ones . in the limit of very rare , highly biased peaks , the large  scale cluster bias @xmath84 , defined by the ratio between the cluster  matter correlation function and the matter auto ",
    "correlation @xmath85 , is @xmath86 , yielding @xmath87 on large scales .",
    "operationally , the em comparison would be most relevant to an observational study of clusters whose virial masses are calibrated by wl ( and thus accurate in both gr and mg ) . alternatively ,",
    "if one ranks clusters by a mass proxy such as galaxy richness , x  ray luminosity , or sz signal , then selects clusters above a threshold  ( i.e. , am method ) , the er comparison is more relevant .",
    "hereafter we simply denote the fiducial gr sample as `` gr '' while comparing it to the `` em '' and `` er '' samples in mg simulations .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the two  component gik model is an excellent analytic description of the joint 2d distribution of radial and tangential velocities of galaxies in the cluster ",
    "centric frame , @xmath88 . here",
    "we will present the results of gik modelling for the cluster samples defined above , and refer the readers to zw13 for details on the gik parameterization and fitting procedures .",
    "figure  [ fig : vblob ] shows the best  fitting @xmath88 for the gr  ( top ) , f5em  ( middle ) , and f4em  ( bottom ) cluster samples at five different radial bins , using dark matter particles as proxy for galaxies .",
    "negative @xmath89 indicates falling toward clusters . following zw13 ,",
    "we define @xmath90 as the tangential velocity component that is projected in the plane of los axis and galaxy position vector in the cluster ",
    "centric frame  ( see the 3d diagram in the figure 2 of zw13 ) .",
    "since the _ average _ galaxy motion around the cluster center is isotropic , the probability distribution of @xmath90 is symmetric about zero .",
    "hereafter we refer to @xmath90 simply as the `` tangential velocity '' .",
    "note that the hubble flow is subtracted when defining @xmath89 , but it will be incorporated when modelling @xmath10 .",
    "the gik of the three cluster samples in figure  [ fig : vblob ] show some generic trends with radius : 1 ) the distribution has two distinct components on very small scales  ( leftmost column ) but only shows a single infall component on large scales ; 2 ) the infall component is symmetric about the mean @xmath89 near the turn  around radius , where infall velocity is comparable to hubble flow  ( middle column ) ; 3 ) the @xmath89 distribution of the infall component is skewed toward positive velocities beyond the turn  around radius  ( two right columns ) , but is negatively skewed below that radius  ( two left columns ) .",
    "the impacts of modified gravity on @xmath88 are subtle but nonetheless visually apparent in figure  [ fig : vblob ] when comparing the three models at the same radial bin  ( i.e. , within the same column ) .",
    "the solid vertical line in each panel indicates the most probable radial velocity , which shifts to more negative @xmath89 with increasing @xmath59  ( i.e. , from top to bottom ) at each radius .",
    "simultaneously , the dispersions of the infall component in the radial and tangential directions also increase as function of @xmath56  the joint distributions in the f4 model are more extended than in gr .",
    "this increased width results in the decreased peak amplitude of the distributions ( which are normalized to unity by definition ) .    to quantify the differences in gik among the three simulations ,",
    "we will focus on the impacts of modified gravity on three of the gik parameters  ( @xmath31 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 ) .",
    "we ignore the other gik parameters defined by zw13  ( seven in total ) , including two parameters describing the virialized component that are irrelevant to this paper , and two others that describe the skewness and the kurtosis of the infall component , which we found to be insensitive to modified gravity .",
    "note that the characteristic radial velocity @xmath31 is not the mean , median , or mode of the radial velocity distribution , but is a characteristic velocity naturally associated with the definition of the skewed _",
    "t_-distribution used for describing the gik infall component  ( see zw13 , equation 6 ) .",

    "we show the parameter profiles for all three types of cluster samples  ( gr , em , and er ) .",
    "the shaded region in each panel indicates the radial bins where gik is dominated by the virialized component and the fit to the infall component is less robust . for the f5 model , the halo mass function is close to that of @xmath13 at high masses , so the em and er samples have little difference in mass and their gik profiles look very similar",
    ". however , as expected from figure  [ fig : vblob ] , the two f5 cluster samples in the @xmath0 simulation show stronger infall  ( top left ) and larger velocity dispersions  ( center and bottom left ) compared to the gr sample . for the f4 model , the difference between the em and er samples is larger , especially in the @xmath31 profiles  ( top right ) , where the difference between the er and gr profiles is almost double that between the em and gr ones . for both samples , the f4 results are more easily distinguished from gr than the f5 results , as expected .",
    "since we anticipate that er comparisons will be more observationally relevant in most cases , we will focus henceforth on the gik of er cluster samples in the mg simulations .",
    "we highlight the differences in gik profiles between er and gr clusters for both chameleon models in figure  [ fig : vdiff ] .",

    "scale clustering as the gr sample .",

    ", there is a bump at @xmath109 in the ratio between @xmath98 of the f4er and the gr samples , but not in the ratio curve for f5er . in the f4 model ,",
    "the fifth force became unscreened from quite early time , so that the velocity field has been enhanced for a long time by @xmath5 .",
    "this means that the peculiar velocities are enhanced by roughly the same factor @xmath110 as the gravitational force , where @xmath110 is between unity and @xmath28 , and the kinetic energy of particles in f4 is thus @xmath111 times that in gr ; meanwhile , the gravitational potential in f4 is @xmath112 times as deep as in gr .",
    "the net result is that the mg effect on the particle kinetic energy dominates over its effect on the cluster potential , so that as a compromise the particles tend to move toward the outer parts of clusters .",
    "the situation is different in the f5 model , where the fifth force became unscreened quite late .",
    "by @xmath5 , the fifth force has become unscreened but only for a short period , so that particle velocities have not been significantly affected by it .",
    "on the other hand , due to the disappearance of the screening , the potential of the cluster suddenly became deeper .",
    "the result is a stronger mg effect on the potential than on the kinetic energy of particles , and particles tend to move toward the inner parts of clusters .",
    "these features have been observed in the halo density profiles of @xmath0 simulations before  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and similar ones have been found in coupled quintessence simulations . using cluster wl measurements , @xcite exploited this small  scale enhancement of cluster density profiles in chameleon gravity and obtained a constraint of @xmath113 at @xmath114 confidence level .",

    "galaxy correlation functions for the three cluster samples , showing a stronger small  scale fingers - of - god  ( fog , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) effect with increasing @xmath59 , but with similar los squashing effect on large scales  ( a.k.a . , kaiser effect , * ? ? ?",
    "however , the most easily visible features of @xmath10 in figure  [ fig : xirs ] are driven by the radial gradient of cluster density profiles , which are fairly insensitive to the influence of chameleon modifications to gravity according to the left panel of figure  [ fig : xi3d_ucurve ] . modified gravity also changes the shape of @xmath10 at fixed @xmath100 via its effects on the gik , re  distributing matter / galaxies along the @xmath101 axis . to reveal this los distortion of @xmath10 by @xmath0 , following zw13 , we compute the characteristic los distance @xmath115 by fitting a powered exponential function to @xmath10 at each fixed @xmath100 , @xmath116 where @xmath8 is the characteristic length scale at which @xmath10 drops to @xmath117 of its maximum value at @xmath118 .",
    "the shape parameter @xmath119 yields a gaussian cutoff for @xmath120 and simple exponential for @xmath121 , though any value is allowed in the fit .",
    "the results of this fitting are shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : xi3d_ucurve ] .",
    "the @xmath8 vs. @xmath100 curves exhibit the characteristic u - shape discovered in zw13  fog stretching at small @xmath100 gives way to kaiser compression at intermediate @xmath100 which gives way to hubble flow expansion at large @xmath100 .",
    "clearly , the @xmath10 distribution along the los is a sensitive probe of @xmath0 models at @xmath9 , becoming more extended with increasing @xmath59  ( e.g. , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 at @xmath125 for gr , f5 , and f4 models , respectively ) .",
    "the detailed shape of @xmath126 reflects a complex interplay among the four elements of the galaxy kinematics around clusters , including the three gik profiles of the infall component  ( @xmath31 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 ) and the virial component  ( see figure 10 of zw13 for an illustrative experiment ) .",
    "for the same reason , the increase of @xmath8 with @xmath56 has different origins at different projected distances .",
    "below @xmath127 , the response of @xmath8 to @xmath56 is uniform with @xmath100 , caused by the uniform increase of dispersion in virial motions . for @xmath128 ,",
    "the @xmath56 dependence of @xmath8 has two contributing sources , one being the increase of tangential velocity dispersions , the other the increase of maximum infall velocities , which transport high  speed matter / galaxies from one side of the cluster in real space to the opposite side in redshift space  ( i.e. , the portion of the fog effect caused by infall ) . for @xmath129 ,",
    "@xmath56 influences the @xmath8 profile mainly via the increase of tangential velocity dispersions .",
    "the radial velocity dispersions only enter into play at large @xmath100 , where the diagnostic power of @xmath10 is diminishing .",
    "although chameleon theories like the hu & sawicki @xmath0 model include the phenomenology of @xmath13 without a _ true _ cosmological constant , @xcite proved that the theories that invoke a chameleon  like scalar to explain cosmic acceleration essentially rely on a form of dark energy rather than a genuine mg effect , even if they are initially described in terms of an altered gravitational action .",
    "conversely , the galileon class of theories is capable of accelerating the cosmic expansion even in the absence of any form of dark energy  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , i.e. , they have so  called `` self  accelerating '' solutions . here",
    "we study the gik for a simplified version of such kind of galileon theories , where an extra galileon  type scalar field that manifests the vainshtein mechanism permeates a universe with the @xmath13 background cosmology .",
    "we employ a suite of galileon simulations with @xmath130 particles on a @xmath130 grid of @xmath131 , evolved using the particle mesh code of  @xcite , which was updated by  @xcite  ( for other galileon / dgp simulations , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the simulations were first used by  @xcite for studying the statistics of matter clustering in real and redshift spaces .",
    "we will briefly introduce the galileon implementation and parameterization here and refer the readers to @xcite for details .",
    "as described in the introduction , the vainshtein mechanism has only one parameter , @xmath24 , which is interpreted as the compton wavelength associated with the graviton mass in massive gravity theories , so that the vainshtein radius of a point mass with mass @xmath132 is @xmath133 for extended objects of the same mass @xmath132 , the vainshtein radii are generally several times larger than @xmath134  e.g. , a nfw halo with @xmath135 has @xmath136 , and galaxies generally have @xmath137 . therefore , whereas the cluster interior below the virial radius belongs to the strongly vainshtein  screened regime , the cluster infall region",
    "is weakly screened , displaying complex interference among galileon fields sourced by the primary cluster and the infalling galaxies and galaxy groups .",
    "we make use of three simulations with the same expansion history and initial condition , one of them a flat @xmath13 universe evolved under normal gravity with @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath65 , and @xmath138 , and the other two immersed in galileon scalar fields with @xmath139 and @xmath140 . in the figures we refer to them simply as `` gr ''  ( i.e. , @xmath141 ) , @xmath139 , and @xmath142 , respectively , and a smaller @xmath24 implies an earlier onset of the fifth force and an effectively stronger fifth force in the late universe  ( see , e.g. , figure 5 of * ? ? ?",
    "* for the change of linear growth rate as function of @xmath24 ) .",
    "note that the `` gr '' simulation is different from what we used for comparing to the @xmath0 simulations , albeit with similar cosmology .",
    "dark matter halos are identified via a spherical overdensity finder with the halo mass defined by @xmath143 , different from the @xmath144 used for the chameleon simulations . since @xmath145",
    ", a halo would have a higher @xmath146 than @xmath144  ( e.g. , @xmath147 for a @xmath76 cluster at @xmath5 in @xmath13 ) .",
    "the halo mass functions , halo bias functions , and matter power spectra of the three simulations can be found in @xcite .",
    "targeting the same redshift range as in  [",
    "sec : frsim ] , we use the @xmath148 output of the simulations  ( not @xmath5 due to the different sets of recorded epochs in the two suites of simulations ) .",
    "since the volume of the galileon simulations is only @xmath149 of that of the chameleon simulations , we have to select samples with a wider mass bin size for robust gik measurements . for the fiducial cluster sample in the gr simulation",
    "we include clusters with @xmath150 , and similar to  [ sec : frsim ] we also select two er cluster samples from respective galileon simulations , with @xmath151 and @xmath152 in the @xmath139 and @xmath142 models , respectively . unlike  [ sec : frsim ] , we do not show the results from the em cluster samples for the gr vs. galileon comparisons , as the relative difference between the em and er samples is similar to what we see in the chameleon simulations .",
    "because of the smaller volume , we can only afford to use dark matter particles as proxy for galaxies .",
    "note that the galileon cluster sample here comprises halos that are intrinsically smaller than the one used in   [ sec : frsim ] , due to different overdensity thresholds used in mass definitions .",
    "figure  [ fig : vdiff_mark ] compares the gik profiles of the two er samples in the galileon simulations to that of the fiducial gr cluster sample .",
    "as intrinsically less massive systems , the fiducial gr clusters show weaker infall velocities and velocity dispersions than the gr clusters used in the chameleon comparison at all distances  ( e.g. , comparing the black curves in the top panels of figure  [ fig : vdiff_mark ] to the black curves in figure  [ fig : v6p ] ) .",
    "however , the relative difference between the mg and gr samples overall looks very similar to what we see in the chameleon comparison  ( e.g. , comparing the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : vdiff_mark ] to figure  [ fig : vdiff ] ) .",
    "as expected , @xmath31 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 all become stronger with decreasing @xmath24  ( i.e. , stronger fifth force ) .",
    "specifically , @xmath31 shows @xmath153 and @xmath154 enhancement at @xmath2 for the @xmath139 and @xmath142 models , respectively , which are comparable to the fractional enhancements in the f5 and f4 chameleon models , respectively .    the only major difference between figure  [ fig : vdiff_mark ] and figure  [ fig : vdiff ] appears in the bottom middle panel : the deviation of @xmath79 profiles from the gr prediction decreases as function of distance , from @xmath155/@xmath156 at @xmath157 to @xmath158/@xmath159 at @xmath2 , whereas in the chameleon comparison the deviation of @xmath79 stays more or less constant with distance",
    "this difference in @xmath79 may be reflecting the different ranges of fifth force in the two models : the galileon has infinite range , so the force is enhanced further way from clusters , whereas the chameleon force is yukawa  suppressed on large scales . however , the pattern of @xmath10 is insensitive to @xmath79 at @xmath9 where the @xmath10 measurement is the most robust , making it an unpromising tool for distinguishing the two mechanisms .",
    "the gik profiles of the em cluster samples in the galileon simulations closely follow those of their corresponding er counterparts , albeit with slightly weaker amplitudes .",
    "figure  [ fig : xi3d_ucurve_mark ] compares the real  space cluster",
    " galaxy cross  correlation function @xmath98  ( left ) and the characteristic los distance @xmath8  ( right ) measured for the three cluster samples .",
    "the shaded region indicates the scales below the force softening length of the simulations , where the correlation function and velocity dispersions are artificially suppressed . on small scales , the ratios between @xmath98 of the galileon er samples and fiducial gr sample  ( bottom left ) display similar features to these in figure  [ fig : xi3d_ucurve ] , including an enhancement interior to the virial radius because the er clusters are more massive , and a bump around @xmath160 , though this is only @xmath161 away from the force resolution limit",
    "to check whether the bump is a numerical artefact , we repeated the same measurements of @xmath98 using a suite of higher resolution  ( but smaller volume ) galileon simulations and verified that the bump is physical . similar to the @xmath0 case in the f4 model , the fast transition from galileon force outside to normal gravity inside causes a sudden change of the depth of the potential well , but not the galaxy velocity ( or kinetic energy ) , which has been experiencing enhancement well before infall .",
    "as the galaxies have excessive kinetic energy , they tend to move to the outer parts of halos , making the density profile lower in the central region of clusters and higher near the edges .",
    "on large scales , the er samples in the galileon simulations exhibit stronger clustering than the gr clusters .",
    "this enhancement in @xmath98 can be understood by starting from the findings of @xcite , which suggest that the halo mass function , the halo bias function , and the matter power spectrum of the galileon simulations are like those of @xmath13 universes with higher @xmath162 . by examining the kaiser effect , where changing @xmath162",
    "can not mimic the large scale boost in the redshift ",
    "space clustering due to mg .",
    "see  @xcite for details .",
    "] for example , at @xmath163 the @xmath139 and the @xmath142 simulations resemble the @xmath13 universes with @xmath164 and @xmath165 , respectively .",
    "since the large  scale @xmath98 of er clusters is almost linearly proportional to the effective @xmath162 , we observe @xmath166 and @xmath167 enhancement in @xmath98 at @xmath168 for clusters in the @xmath139 and @xmath142 models , respectively .    for the redshift",
    " space cluster ",
    "galaxy cross ",
    "correlation function , because the impact of the galileon field on gik is similar to that in the chameleon models , the @xmath8 curves in galileon simulations also exhibit similar deviations from the gr curves , as shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : xi3d_ucurve_mark ] .",
    "the lack of upturn of @xmath8 at small @xmath100 is a consequence of force resolution suppressing velocity dispersions ; we expect that simulations with higher force resolution would show the characteristic u - shape for all three models .",
    "the overall lower amplitude of @xmath8 compared to figure  [ fig : xi3d_ucurve ] is again the result of selecting intrinsically less massive halos .",
    "when we select the galileon clusters to have equal  mass to the gr clusters , the enhancement in large ",
    "scale clustering  ( left panel ) disappears because the large  scale bias is steep function of mass , but the differences in gik and @xmath8 remain .",
    "we have investigated the impact of modified gravity on the galaxy infall motion around massive clusters by applying the gik model developed in zw13 to two suites of @xmath0 and galileon n - body simulations .",
    "both mg theories seek to explain cosmic acceleration by modifying gr on cosmological scales , but they recover gr in dense regions via two distinct `` screening '' effects : the potential  driven chameleon mechanism in @xmath0 and the density  driven vainshtein mechanism in galileon .",
    "however , within the range of parameter space probed by our simulations  ( i.e. , @xmath169 for @xmath0 and @xmath170 for galileon ) , despite having quite different cosmic growth histories , the two theories exhibit strikingly similar gik deviations from gr , with @xmath1 enhancement in the characteristic infall velocity at @xmath2 , and @xmath171 broadening in the radial and tangential velocity dispersions across the infall region , for clusters with mass @xmath172 at @xmath5 .",
    "these deviations are detectable through gik modelling of the redshift  space cluster ",
    "galaxy correlation function @xmath10 , especially when combined with cluster wl measurements .",
    "we highlight the imprint of mg on @xmath10 using the characteristic u - shaped curve of @xmath8 , which increases by @xmath7 at @xmath9 from the gr prediction .",
    "we find little difference between the gik profiles predicted by the two screening mechanisms , except for slightly different trends of the radial velocity dispersion with distance .",
    "it is unclear whether the similar signature of these two distinct modified gravity theories on gik is a coincidence , or a generic result for any typical scalar ",
    "tensor theory that recovers the observed @xmath13like expansion history and reduces to normal gravity in the solar system and binary pulsars . in either case ,",
    "our findings imply that , in combination with wl , galaxy infall kinematics offer a powerful non  parametric cosmological test of modified gravity .",
    "ongoing galaxy redshift surveys will provide large samples of clusters with good statistics for measuring @xmath10 and inferring gik out to large scales .",
    "the main systematic uncertainty arises from the imperfect understanding of the impact of galaxy formation physics on gik . within the context of gik modelling and calibration ,",
    "the infall behavior of realistic galaxies could differ from that of tracers in cosmological simulations  ( e.g. , halos / sub  halos in n - body simulations , post  processed galaxies in semi  analytical galaxy formation models , and simulated galaxies in hydrodynamic simulations , etc ; see  @xcite 2013 ) .",
    "however , we expect minimal impact on the characteristic infall velocity , which is our main tool of estimating the dynamical mass profiles of clusters , as any physical process that modifies galaxy kinematics within halos likely only adds scatter to the velocity dispersions rather than changing the mean .    within the context of testing gravity ,",
    "the effects of galaxy formation physics could be partly degenerate with those of modified gravity .",
    "the observed properties of galaxies , including luminosity , morphology , colour , star formation , and clustering , are known to correlate with the environment  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and mg theories also rely on the environment to mediate the strength of the fifth force . for example , a sample of preferentially blue , star ",
    "forming galaxies may show enhanced infall velocities compared to a galaxy sample that is unbiased in colour in @xmath13 universes , and the enhancement could be mistaken as signal of modified gravity were the selection bias not properly accounted for .",
    "we will investigate the potential systematic uncertainties induced by galaxy formation physics in a future paper , using mock galaxy samples constructed from different hod and semi - analytical model prescriptions .",
    "redshift surveys that probe a range of galaxy types are especially valuable for those cosmological tests because one can check that different classes of galaxies lead to the same cosmological conclusions even though the galaxy samples themselves have different clustering and kinematics .",
    "our gik modelling of @xmath10 is complementary to other semi  analytical approaches based on the halo model  @xcite , both seeking to model the velocity distribution around massive clusters for testing gravity  ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for an alternative method of modelling galaxy redshift  space distortion based on hod ) . the semi  analytical velocity model adopted in @xcite has three components : the empirical infall velocity from the spherical collapse model , the halo - halo pairwise velocity distribution , and the intra - halo velocities ( assumed maxwellian with constant scatter ) .",
    "while the model itself is highly informative , the accuracy is slightly lacking compared to simulation predictions .",
    "we instead use the simulations as emulators for gik , trading more computer time for better accuracy in the prediction of our model . in terms of observational applications ,",
    "our method differs from @xcite in two significant aspects .",
    "first , they use the stacked redshift differences as the observable , but the model predicts the los velocity dispersion , so they are affected by the systematics in the subtraction of hubble flow in the 2-halo term ; in our method hubble flow is naturally incorporated in the calculation of @xmath10 .",
    "second , they consider the velocity distributions up to the second moment , while we are able to model the entire @xmath88 including all higher moments .",
    "established as one of the most powerful probes of dark energy , stacked wl analysis of clusters requires deep imaging surveys that can simultaneously yield lensed background galaxies and foreground cluster sample .",
    "forecasts for stage iii and stage iv dark energy experiments predict cluster wl constraints that are competitive with supernovae , baryon acoustic oscillations , and cosmic shear  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and 8.4 ) . to complement wl as a cosmological test of gravity , gik modelling of galaxy clusters requires overlap with a large galaxy redshift survey , such as the ongoing baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey  ( boss , *",
    "* ) , its higher redshift successor eboss  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the deeper surveys planned for future facilities such as bigboss  @xcite , despec  @xcite , the subaru prime focus spectrograph  @xcite , _ euclid _  @xcite , and _ wfirst _  @xcite .",
    "we expect that , in combination with the stacked cluster wl analysis , the redshift  space cluster  galaxy cross  correlations can reveal an accurate and complete picture of the average galaxy infall around clusters , allowing stringent tests of modified gravity theories for the origin of the accelerating expansion of the universe .",
