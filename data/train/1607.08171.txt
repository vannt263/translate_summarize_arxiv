    "<S> in particular , holographic models of deconfinement were first discussed in the sakai - sugimoto model at finite temperature@xcite and the hard / soft wall model@xcite . in all cases , the confinement / deconfinement transition is identified as the first - order hawking - page phase transition , where the thermal ads is energetically favored at low temperature , while a black hole solution at high temperature @xcite . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we propose the first holographic confinement model without using the hawking - page phase transition .    </S>",
    "<S> we recall an old but appealing proposal of dual superconductor @xcite , stating that the confining phase can be regarded as a dual type ii superconducting state due to the condensation of chromomagentic charges ( monopoles ) , such that the chromoelectric lines between a quark - antiquark pair are squeezed by dual meissner effect into flux tubes , as known as the qcd strings . </S>",
    "<S> one may wonder if the hairy black hole scenario in the holographic model of dual superconductor@xcite works just fine by trivially replacing cooper pairs by monopole condensate , and the backreacted metric in the @xcite might be the confinement geometry in desire . </S>",
    "<S> however , a second thought and straightfoward computation will show this is not the case . </S>",
    "<S> the backreaction of condensate may have resulted to a gapped excitation as shown in the single electron spectral function @xcite , but the attractive force mediated by phonons is coulomb - like , rather than a linear potential for flux tube in the dual picture . </S>",

    "<S> . one can show by explicit calculation that the oversimplified ansatz @xmath11 , which was adopted in the backreacted holographic superconductor such as one in @xcite , is unable to produce the linear potential in the confining phase . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in the appendix , the warping factors can be further pinned down to @xmath12 and @xmath13 after imposing the condition that the onshell action of gravity sector is independent of the choice of @xmath14 after regularization . </S>",
    "<S> the total free energy is given by summing up onshell action of all sectors and the value of @xmath14 is determined by minimizing the total free energy at a given temperature . </S>",
