    "when dealing with conserved charges in a system in equilibrium the usual procedure is to employ the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "the physical picture from which the grand canonical ensemble is derived is that of a system in contact with an infinite reservoir of particles with an associated chemical potential for flow of particles into and out - of the system .",
    "averaging in the grand canonical ensemble is performed over all possible charge states .",
    "the average charge is then fixed by a definite choice of chemical potential .    by contrast , in the canonical ensemble , charge can not move into and out - of the system .",
    "there is no chemical potential .",
    "the charge is fixed and any averaging must be performed only over states with this definite fixed charge .",
    "this provides a more reasonable model for a system which is insulated with respect to charge and a better approximation for experiments involving bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of trapped atoms @xcite .",
    "a clear outline of the path integral formulation of relativistic field theory with exactly conserved energy and charge can be found in refs.@xcite .",
    "the central technique is to insert delta - functions into the trace over states in order to select only those states with chosen eigenvalues of the hamiltonian and charge operators .",
    "this is the technique we shall use to exactly conserve charge in the canonical ensemble .",
    "an example of the application of this method to bec in the canonical ensemble can be found in ref.@xcite where fluctuations in the ground state occupation are studied in the non - interacting , non - relativistic limit .",
    "a further study of the comparison between canonical and grand canonical ensembles with regard to trapped atoms can be found in ref.@xcite .    in this article",
    ", we outline a fully relativistic calculation of bec using the canonical ensemble .",
    "after mathematically formulating the model in the next section we go on to consider the high - temperature , large - volume limit in section  [ s : hot ] ( c.f . refs . ) .",
    "we calculate the proportion of the total charge that occupies the lowest energy state in section  [ s : bec ] , and as expected , the canonical and grand canonical ensembles are found to give the same results in the infinite - volume limit . in section  [ s : fv ]",
    "we consider finite - volume corrections where a difference between the two ensembles is observed .",
    "to study a conserved charge @xmath1 using the canonical ensemble we must identify and only average over those states with this specific charge . as noted above , this",
    "is taken care of by inserting a delta - function into the trace over states .",
    "the partition function is then z = tr\\{_q , } . the density operator @xmath2 in the canonical ensemble gives a probability to each state in accordance with the temperature of the system @xmath3 .",
    "it is given by = e^- , where @xmath4 is the hamiltonian operator .",
    "the total charge @xmath1 has integer value and so the integral form of the delta - function is _ q , q=_-^ d^i ( q - q ) .",
    "the partition function now contains a trace over states where the density operator is multiplied by a charge operator - dependent phase factor z = _ -^ d^i q \\ { e^-i } .",
    "[ eq : z4 ] this phase factor can be absorbed into the states where its effect is felt through a change in the boundary conditions .",
    "however , it is simpler to absorb it as a shift in the hamiltonian of the system :  = + i. the non - hermiticity of this hamiltonian would concern us if we were to apply it to a dynamical problem . in thermal equilibrium",
    "this is nothing more than a mathematical trick .",
    "we shall consider a relativistic @xmath0-invariant scalar theory .",
    "this is one of the simplest theories which contains a conserved charge .",
    "it is useful as a simplified version of the higgs sector and also for describing atomic gases in its non - relativistic limit .",
    "the hamiltonian and charge are given by & = & _ v d^3 x , + & = & _ v d^3 x ( _ 2_1 -_1_2 ) .    the trace in eq.([eq : z4 ] ) can be expressed as a functional integral in terms of the lagrangian for this system @xcite \\",

    "whilst doing this we shall anticipate the existence of a condensate by giving the fields a spatially constant component @xmath5 to be determined  @xcite .",

    "in the limit of large @xmath25 and small @xmath16 we may make the approximation ^-x^2(x-1)^2 ~e^-x^2 . since this exponential factor suppresses any potential contribution for larger values of @xmath23 we may further extend the integration range to infinity with negligible effect giving z ~n ( ) _ -^ dx ( 2q x)^- v(m^2 + ) v^2 ^ -x^2 .",
    "[ eq : zcalc ] this is the canonical partition function for an @xmath0-invariant scalar field theory with total conserved charge @xmath1 .",
    "the integral can be performed analytically . in the next section",
    "we shall use @xmath26 to demonstrate bose - einstein condensation in the canonical ensemble .",
    "the classical variable @xmath5 represents the constant expectation value of the field and is to be determined .",
    "we first identify @xmath27 with the effective potential for the field .",
    "the correct solution @xmath5 must minimize the effective potential : z = = 0 . applying this condition to @xmath26 in eq.([eq : zcalc ] ) we find 0=v_a(m^2 + ) .",

    "the first solution is trivial .",
    "the second solution exists when @xmath28 .",
    "we may therefore define a critical temperature to mark the point at which the field develops a non - zero expectation value t_c==.    to express the charge stored in the ground state we write out the total charge in integral form : q = q= _ -^ d^i q i\\{e^-i } giving q&=&(+v^2 ) + & = & q_fluct+q_cond .",
    "here we can divide the contributions to the charge into two types .",

    "of course , these equations are only valid in the high - temperature limit and we can not rely on them when the condensate becomes big .    it has been demonstrated how we can understand bec without using a chemical potential .",
    "we achieve the same result as for the grand canonical ensemble in the high - temperature , large - volume limit .",
    "up until now , the canonical ensemble has proved to be more complicated than the grand canonical ensemble without offering any new results . however , now we stand to benefit from the fact that the canonical ensemble provides a more realistic picture of a finite - volume system , closed to the movement of charge into and out - of that volume . to continue from the previous section we work in the high - temperature region and the bosons are not subjected to any external potential within their volume .",
    "it is well known that there is no phase transition involved in bose - einstein condensation for finite volumes .",
    "however , we may still characterize the process by studying the proportion of the total charge stored in the lowest energy state . in the grand canonical ensemble the charge in the lowest energy state",
    "is given by q_0=. for @xmath31 when the charge occupying the lowest energy state compares with the charge stored in fluctuations , we may think of @xmath32 @xcite .",
