    "it is generally accepted that the @xmath1 interaction in the isospin - zero state is strongly attractive and produces a quasi - bound state , which shows itself as the @xmath2 resonance in the lower @xmath9 channel .",
    "this fact led to the conjecture that a quasi - bound state could also exist in the @xmath10 three - body system .",
    "the first paper on the topic appeared more than 50 years ago  @xcite , but it was ref .",
    "@xcite which arouse a large interest in the question of the existence and properties of such a state .",
    "it triggered many theoretical papers devoted to the @xmath11 system and in the sequel also experimental efforts .",
    "however , so far the experimental results neither agree with theoretical predictions nor between themselves .",
    "indeed , the only point on which all theorists agree , is that a quasi - bound state in the @xmath11 really exists .",
    "but the actual predictions for its binding energy and width vary over a fairly wide range .    a study with the aim to find a similar quasi - bound state in the @xmath12 system , which differs from the @xmath11 by quantum numbers ( @xmath13 versus @xmath14 ) gave negative results  @xcite .    another possible candidate for a three - body system with a quasi - bound state",
    "is @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast to @xmath10 , however , it contains the @xmath3 interaction , which is expected to be repulsive @xcite .",
    "thus , the principal question is whether the repulsion is strong enough to exclude the possibility of a quasi - bound state formation in the system .",
    "a first exploratory investigation of the @xmath0 system was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this variational calculation based on a simplified two - body input indeed a bound state was found .    in the present paper we report on the first dynamically exact calculation of a quasi - bound state in the @xmath0 system .",
    "we solve the faddeev - type alt - grassberger - sandhas ( ags ) equations with two phenomenological and one chirally motivated @xmath1 potentials .",
    "the potentials describe experimental data equally well and produce a one- or two - pole structure of the @xmath2 resonance .",
    "they were originally designed to address the influence of the number of poles of the resonance on various properties of the @xmath1 and @xmath10 systems ( quasi - bound states in @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath12 scattering and @xmath15 level shift and width of kaonic deuterium ) , an issue which was of relevance for the strangeness physics community , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "there is no experimental information on the @xmath16 system .",
    "however , recently lattice qcd calculations of the @xmath5 @xmath17-wave scattering length have become available @xcite and we take those results as guideline for constructing the @xmath16 potential .",
    "the published scattering lengths are small and negative and , thus , suggest a weakly repulsive interaction . on the phenomenological level one can exploit the fact that the @xmath16 ( or @xmath5 ) interaction is related to the one in the @xmath18 system via su(3 ) flavor symmetry . for the latter several potential models can be found in the literature .",
    "we adopt here the @xmath19 coupled channels model developed by the jlich group @xcite as starting point for generating another @xmath16 interaction .",
    "this model , derived in the meson - exchange framework , predicts a somewhat more repulsive @xmath16 interaction . in the actual calculation",
    "separable representations are employed , and we construct the @xmath3 potentials in such away that they reproduce the phase shifts of the jlich @xmath16 meson exchange model and the scattering length of the lattice qcd calculation  @xcite , respectively .    the position and width of the @xmath0 quasi - bound state is evaluated in two different ways .",
    "first , we perform a direct search for the three - body pole in the complex energy plane .",
    "to do this we find the solvability condition of the homogeneous ags equations .",
    "in addition we employ the  inverse determinant  method proposed and successfully used in ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath11 system .",
    "it consists in the calculation of the inverse determinant of the kernel of the ags equations and fitting a breit - wigner type function to the peak in its modulus squared .",
    "the paper is structured in the following way : the three - body equations , which were derived and solved , are described in the next section .",
    "the two - body interactions , being an input for the ags equations , can be found in section  [ interactions_sect ] .",
    "the obtained results are presented and discussed in the section iv , while the last section contains our conclusions .",
    "the @xmath1 system is coupled to other channels , in particular , to the @xmath9 system , where the @xmath2 resonance is observed . since it was shown in  @xcite that a proper inclusion of the @xmath9 channel is important for the @xmath10 system , we assume that the same is also the case for @xmath0 . the three - body faddeev - type ags equations for the @xmath20 system with coupled @xmath21 channel are of the form @xmath22 where the unknown operators @xmath23 describe the elastic and re - arrangement processes @xmath24 .",

    "the @xmath62 transition operator has the proper symmetry properties already ( while @xmath63 is antisymmetric ) .",
    "the remaining operators acquire the necessary symmetry properties in the following combinations : @xmath64    in momentum representation the system of operator equations ( [ x_hom ] ) turns into a system of integral equations , schematically given by @xmath65 this system is then discretized , and the value of @xmath66 at which the determinant of the kernel matrix @xmath67_{mn}$ ] is equal to zero is determined .",
    "this complex energy , located on the proper energy sheet , corresponds to the pole of the quasi - bound state .    in the present study",
    "we determine the pole position in two ways .",

    "we have to rotate the contour of the integration in eq .",
    "( [ ags_imp ] ) into the complex momentum plane in order to avoid irregular regions and singularities , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion .",
    "since the analytic continuation of the integral equations into the complex plane is a non - trivial procedure , we employ here in addition the inverse determinant method proposed and successfully applied in ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath11 system .",
    "it uses the fact that the function @xmath68 , calculated along the real energy axis @xmath66 , exhibits a resonance shape in the neighbourhood of the pole position .",
    "this bump can be fitted using the breit - wigner type formula , and the position and the width of the resonance can be estimated . since the calculations in this case are performed on the real energy axis , it allows to avoid possible problems with the analytic continuation of the equations into the complex momentum plane .",
    "it was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that the two methods are indeed complementary .",
    "however , it is necessary to keep in mind that the second method gives a reliable estimation of the pole position only in the case where the resonance is quite narrow and , therefore , the produced bump is fairly pronounced .",

    "( [ voperator ] ) , in momentum representation is @xmath69    the used @xmath1 and @xmath3 interactions are described in the following subsections .",
    "the remaining interactions in the three - body system with coupled @xmath0 and @xmath21 channels are those in the lower - lying three - body channel , namely @xmath9 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 . the first one , @xmath9 , is part of the employed coupled - channel model for the @xmath1 interaction .",
    "almost nothing is known about the @xmath72 interaction , in particular , there is no experimental information .",
    "there are suggestions  @xcite that this strangeness @xmath73 system can form and couple to @xmath74 resonances .",
    "the @xmath75 system is related to @xmath76 via charge conjugation and for the latter phase shifts are available @xcite .",
    "thus , in principle , it would be possible to construct a potential in a similar way as for the @xmath1 interaction described below by fitting its parameters to those phase shifts .",
    "however , we assume that these two interactions in the lower three - body channel are not so important for the system under consideration and can be omitted . in any case , keeping in mind the unclear situation with regard to the @xmath72 interaction , an inclusion of those channels into the calculation would not lead to quantitatively better constrained @xmath0 quasi - bound state results .",
    "therefore , our three - body calculation with the coupled @xmath77 channels has only one non - zero interaction in the lower channel : the @xmath9 , coupled to the @xmath1 .",
    "then our two - channel three - body calculation with coupled - channel @xmath78 potential is equivalent to the one - channel three - body calculation utilizing the so - called exact optical @xmath1 potential , see @xcite .",
    "we performed calculations based on both formulations and obtained perfect agreement between their results .",
    "several models of the @xmath1 interaction were constructed by us in the past for application in our works devoted to the @xmath10 system . in the present study",
    "we employ three of those .",
    "in particular , we use the two phenomenological @xmath79 potentials that yield a one- or two - pole structure of the @xmath2 resonance which were presented in  @xcite .",
    "the form factors of the one - pole version of the potential and those of the @xmath1 channel of the two - pole version have a yamaguchi form @xmath80 while a slightly more complicated form is used for the @xmath9 channel @xmath81 ^ 2}\\ ] ] in the two - pole model of the interation .",
    "recently , a chirally motivated potential describing the coupled @xmath82 channels was constructed and used in  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the energy independent phenomenological models mentioned above the chirally motivated potential has strength constants @xmath83 , which depend on the energy in the two - body subsystem @xmath84 .",
    "all three potentials were fitted to data on @xmath1 scattering and characteristics of kaonic hydrogen . in particular , the potentials reproduce the measured cross sections of elastic ( @xmath85 ) and inelastic ( @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 ) scattering ( the last reaction is described by the chirally motivated potential only ) from different experiments  @xcite .",
    "they also reproduce the accurately measured threshold branching ratios @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93  @xcite @xmath94 since the @xmath95 channel is taken into account in the phenomenological potentials indirectly , through an imaginary part of one of the @xmath96 parameters , we constructed a new threshold branching ratio based on @xmath92 and @xmath93 : @xmath97 which has an `` experimental '' value ( derived from the experimental data on @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) @xmath98 the chirally motivated potential reproduces all three experimental branching ratios directly .",
    "finally , all three @xmath1 models reproduce the most recent experimental results of the siddharta experiment  @xcite on the @xmath15 level shift @xmath99 and width @xmath100 of kaonic hydrogen @xmath101 note that those quantities were calculated directly , without using some approximate formula .",
    "all @xmath1 results were obtained by solving coupled - channels lippmann - schwinger equation with the strong interaction plus the coulomb potential .",
    "in addition , the physical masses of the involved particles were used , so that the associated two - body isospin nonconservation is properly included .",
    "however , the three - body calculations are performed with isospin averaged masses and without coulomb interaction for simplicity reasons but also because we expect the pertinent effects to be small .",
    "irrespective of the number of poles that constitute the @xmath2 resonance , which appears as a quasi - bound state in the @xmath1 channel and as a resonance in the lower channels , for all considered potentials the resulting isospin - zero elastic @xmath9 cross sections has a peak near the position of the resonance as given by the particle data group ( pdg ) with comparable width ( @xmath102 mev , @xmath103 mev according to the most recent issue  @xcite ) .",

    "the results obtained with the phenomenological @xmath1 potentials exhibit more sensitivity to the @xmath3 interaction than the chirally motivated interaction .",
    "as was expected , the less repulsive @xmath3 model that simulates the lattice qcd results leads to somewhat deeper quasi - bound three - body state than the @xmath3 interaction based on the original jlich @xmath153 model . the largest difference between results based on the potentials @xmath130 and",

    "a less repulsive @xmath3 interaction also leads to a more narrow @xmath0 quasi - bound state in all the cases .",
    "a comparison of the pole positions obtained from the direct pole search to the ones that follow from the inverse determinant method reveals that the accuracy of the second method is much lower for the phenomenological @xmath1 interactions than for the chirally motivated one .",

    "the one - to - one connection between a complex pole and the breit - wigner form of the corresponding bump on the real axis is obviously less pronounced if the pole is situated further away from the real axis .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the binding energies and widths of the quasi - bound states in the @xmath0 system with those for @xmath10 , obtained in  @xcite . in both three - body systems",
    "the strongly attractive @xmath1 interaction is present and plays an essential role .",
    "we see that for a specific @xmath1 potential the quasi - bound state in the strangeness @xmath73 @xmath0 system is only about half as deep as that in the @xmath154 three - body system .",
    "the @xmath0 states are also much broader , especially those obtained with the phenomenological @xmath1 models .",
    "the differences in the binding energies are expected since the @xmath155 interaction appearing in @xmath10 is attractive , while the @xmath3 interaction in @xmath0 is repulsive .",
    "their ( attractive or repulsive ) character is , probably , the origin of the differences in the widths too .",
    "as already said in the introduction , there has been a previous investigation on the @xmath0 system  @xcite .",
    "though the binding energies reported in that work are of the same order of magnitude we want to emphasize that in reality it is difficult to compare our results with the ones in that paper .",
    "the authors of  @xcite used energy - independent as well as energy - dependent potentials , but the two - body energy of the latter is fixed arbitrarily . moreover ,",
    "the imaginary parts of all complex potentials are completely ignored in their variational calculations . that imaginary parts are treated only perturbatively , which , probably , is one of the reasons of the strong underestimation of the @xmath0 widths in comparison to ours . in a series of works devoted to the @xmath10 system we demonstrated that a proper inclusion of the lower - lying channels  either by a direct inclusion or by using the exact optical potential , see e.g.  @xcite  is very important .",

    "the quasi - bound state in the strangeness @xmath73 @xmath0 system turned out to be much shallower and broader than the one in the @xmath154 @xmath10 system , when comparing calculations with the same @xmath1 potential .",

    "this state has the same quantum numbers as a @xmath74 baryon with @xmath159 , as already noted in  @xcite .",
    "the available experimental information on the @xmath74 spectrum is rather limited , see @xcite , and for @xmath160 only the ground state ( with an isospin - averaged mass of 1318 mev ) is established .",

    "there is a @xmath74(1950 ) listed by the pdg but its quantum numbers @xmath161 are not determined and it is unclear whether it should be identified with the quark - model state .",
    "indeed the pdg suggests that there could be even more than one resonance in this region because the mass values of the experimental evidence summarized in the listing @xcite scatter over 70 mev or so .",
    "it is interesting to see that four of the values would be roughly consistent with the quasi - bound state found in the present study .",
    "specifically , the experiment reported in ref .",
    "@xcite yielded a mass of @xmath162 mev and a width of @xmath163 mev that is more or less compatible with the range of values for the pole position that emerged from our three - body calculation . in any case",
    ", in view of concrete plans for experiments dedicated to @xmath74 baryon spectroscopy at j - parc @xcite and jlab @xcite there are good chances that more information about the strangeness @xmath73 resonances will become available .",
    "probably , then one can draw more solid conclusions on the @xmath0 quasi - bound state .",
