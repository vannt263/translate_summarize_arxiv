    "recently , circuit - quantum electrodynamics ( c - qed ) three - level systems have attracted much attention @xcite because they are ideal solid - state systems to investigate quantum interference phenomena , for instance , electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite .",
    "the eit phenomenon is a key factor in such a three - level system mainly because of its potential application in quantum information processing as a photonic information storage device @xcite .",
    "however , when field strengths are large , the eit can be mixed with , or affected by , the so - called autler - townes ( at ) effect @xcite , which is a generic type of ac - stark splitting . for this reason , the experimental discrimination between these two different yet similar effects becomes an important task @xcite .",
    "in fact , recent studies @xcite suggest possible methods to discriminate between multi - photon processes and to single out the pure two - photon process , which is a result of constructive or destructive quantum interference , depending on the ratio of the decay rates @xcite",
    ". nevertheless experimental analyses on the quantum interference phenomena in terms of decay rates for c - qed systems have seldom been carried out .    [ !",

    "the three - level artificial atom is realized by a transmon qubit which is integrated in a superconducting cavity @xcite .",
    "we find that there are two generically different types of at splitting cooperatively depending on the relative strength of the two driving fields and the relative decay rates . in the weak - field limit where the at effect is suppressed ,",
    "we analyze the measured level population by decomposing the density matrix elements and find that a constructive , rather than destructive , interference phenomenon occurs in the configuration of the decay rates in our system . considering that the quantum interference phenomena are rarely observed in a single - atom level @xcite , and are mostly seen in ensemble states of a many - atom system in quantum optics @xcite , our work is very significant in itself although it is done in an artificial single - atom system .",
    "furthermore our work has also shown that an appropriate pumping - probe configuration with the right decay - rate ratio is required to establish an eit device for future application in c - qed systems .",
    "figure 1(a ) depicts our experimental setup .",
    "the sample is fabricated on a 300-nm - thick sio@xmath8 layer thermally grown on a high - purity silicon substrate through conventional electron - beam lithography and aluminum double - angle evaporation .",
    "the qubit is located on the voltage antinode of a quarter - wavelength coplanar waveguide resonator @xcite with a resonance frequency of @xmath9 ghz and an energy damping rate of @xmath10 mhz .",
    "figure 1(b ) specifies various symbols for our @xmath0-system , defining the relaxation rates @xmath11 and @xmath12 from levels @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively , as well as the energy gaps , @xmath15 , etc .",
    "the system is maintained at a temperature of 40 mk on the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator .",
    "the vacuum rabi splitting for the lower - level transition is @xmath16 mhz , whereas the coupling rate of the upper level transition is @xmath17 mhz from spectroscopy , which approximates to the transmon - resonator coupling strength ratio @xmath18 .",
    "we record phase changes by the dispersive shift of resonance frequency @xcite from the reflection signal ( @xmath19 ) with a vector network analyzer .",
    "the average photon numbers of cavity probe tone are less than unity to obtain the spectra of @xmath5 and @xmath20 over the flux bias , as shown in fig .",
    "we extract the charge energy @xmath21 ghz and the maximum josephson energy @xmath22 ghz based on a model for transmon qubit @xcite .",
    "we tune @xmath23 to be its maximum at @xmath24 = 0 or 1 ( @xmath25 is the magnetic - flux quantum ) to reduce the cavity effect which can modify the spontaneous decay rates , i.e. , the purcell effect @xcite , meaning that we have @xmath26 ghz and @xmath27 ghz .",
    "the two - photon process for @xmath28 can be identified from the separate measurements of single - tone ( blue line ) and two - tone ( red line ) spectroscopy in the saturation limit of a dispersive shift in the cavity frequency , as shown in fig .",
    "here , we also obtain the heights of the peaks @xmath29 and @xmath30 in the saturation limits , which will determine the ratio of the level populations via @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the density - matrix element for energy level @xmath33 , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are weighting factors ( this is discussed later ) .",
    "on the other hand , we obtain the decay rates of each level from time domain measurements based on the theory of damped rabi oscillations @xcite .",
    "the results indicate that @xmath36 mhz , @xmath37 mhz , @xmath38 mhz , and @xmath39 mhz , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the relaxation rate and the pure dephasing rate from states @xmath42 to @xmath43 , respectively @xcite .",
    "( source output reading ) as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",

    "after the experiment is set up as described , we carry out the level population mapping over the ( @xmath46 ) plane for varying values of @xmath47 while keeping the value of @xmath48 fixed , as shown in figs",
    ".  2(a)2(d ) .",
    "the archetypal quantum behavior of avoided crossing @xcite is manifested throughout the figures , which is , of course , a direct result of the level splitting induced by the driving fields . however , a much more interesting feature is that the direction of the anticrossing borderline turns by 90 degrees , as seen from figs .",
    "2(a)2(d ) .",
    "this rotation of lines implies that the at splitting is brought about by the stronger field of the two because the stronger field acts as `` pump , '' whereas the weaker field acts as `` probe . ''",
    "therefore , if @xmath47 is greater than @xmath48 , the former splits level @xmath13 and the latter probes this splitting , and vice versa . in our view , this interesting feature has not been clearly pointed out in the literature . when the two rabi frequencies are comparable to each other , i.e. , @xmath49 as shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) , level @xmath13 suffers double splitting induced by the two fields ( called supersplitting by some ) @xcite , which eventually blurs the spectrum around the bare resonance point .",
    "the corresponding numerical - calculation results , based on the master - equation formalism @xcite , reproduce our results very well ( refer to appendix a for further discussions on the numerical methods and simulation results ) .",
    "we now compare the responses of the system when ( 1 ) the lower transition is pumped and ( 2 ) the upper transition is pumped , as shown in figs .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) , respectively . to obtain the responses presented in fig .",
    "3(a ) , we fix @xmath50 mhz and scan the probe frequency @xmath2 around upper transition @xmath51 for increasing values of @xmath47 , such that @xmath52 , with the pump frequency tuned to the lower transition ( @xmath53 ) . to obtain the responses presented in fig",
    "3(b ) , we fix @xmath54 mhz and scan the probe frequency @xmath1 around lower transition @xmath5 for increasing values of @xmath48 , such that @xmath55 , with the pump frequency tuned to the upper transition ( @xmath56 ) . in both cases , as the pump strength [ i.e. , @xmath47 in fig",
    ".  3(a ) and @xmath48 in fig .",
    "3(b ) ] increases , the spectral splitting widens as expected .",
    "however , we can clearly see a striking difference between the two cases in that the brightness of the peaks diminishes in fig .",
    "3(a ) , whereas it remains essentially constant in fig .",
    "let us therefore call the case of fig .",
    "3(a ) type i and the case of fig .",
    "3(b ) type ii .",
    "this feature is quantitatively demonstrated in figs .",
    "3(c ) and 3(d ) .",
    "the colors of each of the lines in figs .",
    "3(c ) and 3(d ) correspond to those of the horizontal dots indicating the pump strength in figs .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) , respectively . figures 3(e ) and 3(f ) present the numerical calculations for quantity @xmath57 for both cases , agreeing well with the experimental data presented in figs .",
    "3(c ) and 3(d ) , respectively .",
    "the weighting factors @xmath34 = 1.06 and @xmath35 = 1.65 are extracted from the resonance pull of the cavity using the relationship @xmath58 @xcite , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are defined in fig .",
    "then , we investigate the cause for the significant difference between type i and type ii .",
    "we first assumed that this difference may occur due to the corresponding pump configuration .",
    "however , further investigation indicates that the atomic decay rates play an important role as well .",
    "first , we define the decay rates , @xmath59 mhz and @xmath60 mhz . therefore , obviously @xmath61 in our system . given this case",
    ", we trace the heights of the resonance peaks under the conditions presented in figs .  3(e ) and 3(f ) by scanning the corresponding pump strengths .",
    "the result is indicated by the solid circles and triangles in fig .",
    "the solid triangles in fig .",
    "3(g ) correspond to the condition in fig .",
    "3(e ) , i.e. , @xmath62 , which shows the peak heights decreasing with increasing @xmath47 values , agreeing well with the trend shown in fig .",
    "3(e ) , i.e. , type i. on the other hand , the solid circles corresponding to the condition in fig .",
    "3(f ) , i.e. , @xmath55 , show the peak heights hardly varying over a wide range of @xmath48 values , agreeing well with the trend in fig .",
    "3(f ) , i.e. , type ii .",
    "the red solid and dotted lines in fig .",
    "3(g ) are obtained by just reversing the size of the decay rates , i.e.,@xmath63 .",
    "the red solid line corresponds to the condition @xmath62 , and the red dashed line corresponds to @xmath55 .",
    "quite surprisingly , the result indicates that the types of splitting are essentially interchanged upon reversal of the corresponding decay strengths .",
    "the underlying physics of this interesting phenomenon must be simple but it is yet to be explored theoretically . in fig .",
    "3(h ) , we measure the dependence of the peak separations @xmath64 on field power @xmath65 from figs .  3(a ) and 3(b ) .",
    "the results for both cases are linear as expected in the strong field regime because @xmath66 , giving a slope ratio of @xmath671.4 (= 2.0ghz@xmath68v@xmath69/1.4ghz@xmath68v@xmath69 ) , which is another manifestation of the ratio @xmath70 .",
    "thus , the field power unit is translated to rabi frequency via linear extrapolation to amplitude zero .",
    "this agrees well with the model introduced in ref .",
    "( b ) decomposition of the absorption spectrum im@xmath71 into three terms as mentioned in the text , for the experimental parameters @xmath45 = 3.8 mhz and @xmath44 = 0.55 mhz .",
    "( c ) spectral behavior of pure two - photon process for various relative decay rates .",
    "the blue line corresponds to our experimental condition of @xmath72 = 2.5 .",
    "( d ) changes in the three lines in ( b ) for a much weaker value of @xmath44= 0.05 mhz .",
    "insets in ( b ) and ( d ) are double lorentzian fits ( black dashed line ) for im@xmath71.,width=230 ]    in order to observe the sheer quantum coherence effects , we investigate the weak - field regime , where the rabi frequencies are not greater than the decay rates of the system , so as to avoid complications such as the power splitting discussed previously . to obtain the results presented in fig .",
    "4(a ) , we fix the pump strength @xmath45 = 3.8 mhz at resonant with the upper transition frequency , i.e. , @xmath56 , given the total decay rate of the system , @xmath73 mhz .",
    "then , we scan the probe frequency @xmath1 around the lower transition @xmath5 for varying values of probe strength @xmath47 , such that @xmath74 .",
    "the thin smooth lines are theoretical curves corresponding to @xmath57 with the aforementioned values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "a dip clearly develops as the probe strength decreases , such that @xmath75 .",
    "we discuss the cause for the formation of this dip in the following paragraphs .",
    "the population profile of the probe ( @xmath76 ) is known to be proportional to im@xmath71 @xcite .",
    "we decompose the corresponding theoretical spectrum of im@xmath71 for the red line in fig .",
    "4(a ) , i.e. , the line for @xmath44 = 0.55 mhz , into three components  pure one - photon coherence , pure two - photon coherence , and mixed coherence component  as shown in fig .",
    "4(b ) ; this is a strategy developed in the previous studies on three - level systems @xcite , further details of which are presented in appendix b. the black dotted line represents one - photon coherence , i.e. , the step - by - step excitation from the ground state to the level top via the intermediate level . on the other hand ,",
    "the pure two - photon coherence represented by the blue dashed line is the process in which the level populations do not change .",
    "the mixed coherence component represented by the green dotted line is determined by subtracting the values of the one - photon and pure two - photon coherences from the total absorption strength .",
    "this is relevant to the two - photon absorption process where the level population oscillates between the ground state and the level - top .",
    "figure 4(b ) clearly shows that the pure two - photon coherence process ( blue dashed line ) causes the dip at the center .",
    "we now investigate the variation of the pure two - photon coherence signal against the relative decay rate @xmath72 , as shown in fig .",
    "4(c ) , where we fix @xmath77 at the value of our qubit , and vary @xmath78 .",
    "the blue line ( @xmath79 ) in the figure corresponds to the experimental situation of our qubit .",
    "the figure clearly shows that the dip gets deeper as the ratio @xmath72 decreases .",
    "it is known that destructive ( constructive ) interference is expected when the decay ratio @xmath72 is smaller ( larger ) than unity @xcite .",
    "therefore , according to the theory , for the condition , @xmath80 , constructive interference is expected to occur in our system .",
    "even though the calculated two - photon coherence terms have not shown a qualitative change , they provide reasonable evidence for the constructive interference .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "4(b ) indicates that the depth of the total spectrum dip for our experimental condition , i.e. , for @xmath80 , is shallower than the double lorentzian dip ( black dashed line ) which is another signature of the constructive interference , although the difference is small where we assume double lorentzian fits the at splitting .    considering the possibility that the non - negligible probe strength may wash out the coherence and result in poor resolution , we look at the case of an even smaller value of probe strength @xmath81 mhz , as shown in fig .",
    "there are no significant differences observed in comparison to fig .",
    "4(b ) except for the mixed term which is influenced mainly by the probe field intensity .",
    "thus , we conclude that the experimentally observed spectral dip in fig .",
    "4(a ) is most likely due to constructive quantum interference .",
    "we have come to the conclusion of constructive interference taking into account both spectra of absorption and pure two photon altogether , as discussed above .",
    "on the other hand , when the decay - rate ratio is reverted as @xmath82 , for instance , a fano - profile dip due to the destructive interference is theoretically predicted in appendix c. currently , quantum interference in the case of lower - level driving is yet to be explored because the spectral signal still remains unresolved in the weak - field limit . in this configuration",
    ", only constructive interference is theoretically expected to occur , regardless of the ratio of the decay rates @xcite .",
    "we investigated the autler - townes splitting effects in the strong - field limit in a three - level cascade system of an artificial atom .",
    "we found that both the relative strength between the applied fields and the relative level decay rates cooperatively determine the characteristics of the autler - townes spectrum . in the weak - field limit",
    ", we analyzed the resonance dips by decomposing the density matrix into three different coherence components , thereby discriminating between the multiphoton processes .",
