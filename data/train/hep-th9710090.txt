    "spectral densities are important quantities in finite temperature field theory @xcite .",
    "but they are not easy quantities to evaluate perturbatively at nonzero temperature , especially for many - point spectral densities .",
    "the two - point spectral densities have been widely studied and applied to qgp studies @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the cutkosky rules for calculating the imaginary parts of thermal green functions using the formalism of thermo - field dynamics ( tfd ) was presented .",
    "recently these cutting rules were reexamined within the closed time path ( ctp ) formalism @xcite and given a simple physical interpretation@xcite .",
    "the imaginary time cutting rules for calculating two - point spectral densities were investigated in @xcite .",
    "three - point spectral densities , on the other hand , have so far received less quantitative attention . the only available calculation for gauge theories is published in @xcite where the @xmath0-point spectral densities for pure gluon dynamics were calculated in the hard thermal loop ( htl ) approximation using the imaginary time formalism ( itf ) @xcite .",
    "the spectral representation of three - point functions for selfinteracting scalar fields were discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "hard thermal loops ( htls ) are gauge invariant and satisfy simple abelian ward identities @xcite .",
    "these remarkable properties have triggered many interesting investigations @xcite . the computation oh htls is generally fairly technical because of their complicated momentum and energy dependence , but it can be simplified by using the ward identities @xcite .",
    "all htls can be derived from a generating functional based on an effective lagrangian @xcite .",
    "they describe classical aspects of hot field theories and can thus also be obtained from classical kinetic equations @xcite",
    ". however , as taylor stated in @xcite , for many purposes one does not need the htl amplitudes themselves , but only their discontinuities which are described by spectral densities .",
    "these spectral densities also provide a natural connection between the green functions in the real time formulation ( rtf ) of thermal field theory and the itf .",
    "while the htl resummation method was developed within the imaginary time formalism ( itf ) , with primary attention focussed on equilibrium properties of hot field theories , realistic physical systems are frequently out of thermal equilibrium and require calculations in real time .",
    "recently this has motivated increased interest in the real time formulation of thermal field theories and its non - equilibrium extensions .",
    "in the present paper we therefore study the spectral functions and ward identities for finite temperature qed in the real time formalism ( rtf ) . extending the recently derived , completely general spectral representation of the real - time 3-point vertex function at finite temperature from scalar field theory to the case of qed",
    ", we then show how to implement the htl approximation in real time . as shown in @xcite , for 2-point functions",
    "this procedure allows for a simple generalization of the htl resummation scheme to general non - equilibrium situations . within the htl approximation",
    "we evaluate explicitly the 3-point spectral densities and derive a set of finite temperature ward identities between the real - time 2- and 3-point functions .",
    "although one needs in general two independent spectral densities to describe the real - time 3-point vertex at finite temperature @xcite , the two are shown to become degenerate in the htl approximation .",
    "this agrees with previous findings in refs .",
    "our ward identities between the real - time hard thermal loops in qed also agree with the general real - time finite temperature ward identities recently derived in ref .",
