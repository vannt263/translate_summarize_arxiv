    "understanding how the interface between a polymer and another material fails is important for many industrial applications and has therefore been the subject of many studies in the last 30 years @xcite .",
    "a quantity of central interest is the _ interface toughness _ ( also called the adhesion energy ) , @xmath7 , which is the energy per unit area needed to make a crack separating the two materials travel along the interface . if the polymer is above its glass transition temperature , this energy is dissipated - as the crack advances - by both local processes ( occurring near the crack tip ) and viscoelastic losses ( taking place over macroscopic volumes ) @xcite .",
    "some years ago , gent and schultz @xcite and andrews and kinloch @xcite showed that , for elastomeric adhesives , the variations of the interface toughness , g , with the crack velocity , @xmath5 , can be written as :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the limiting value of the fracture energy at zero rate of crack growth , and represents local processes . according to eq.([eq gent ] ) , the contribution of the bulk viscoelastic losses , @xmath10 , is given by @xmath11 ( where the temperature - shift factor @xmath12 is given by the williams - landel - ferry equation @xcite ) and is therefore itself proportional to the local contribution @xmath9 .",
    "this remarkable fact was explained by de gennes at the level of scaling laws @xcite , and further developed more rigorously by hui , xu and kramer @xcite ( for other related studies , see @xcite ) . in the first part of this paper ,",
    "we reconsider de gennes model in the case of the interface between a poorly crosslinked elastomer ( or a polymer melt ) and a solid surface .",
    "we show , in particular , that the far - field viscoelastic contributions to the interface toughness play a significant role at separation rates much lower than previously thought .",
    "we also reconsider the profile of the crack @xcite , confirming some predictions of the earlier approach of greenwood and johnson @xcite . in the second part of the paper we present experimental results for the adhesion between a polymer melt and a glass surface ( for earlier work on `` tack '' ,",
    "see , _ e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . these results for the fracture energy and the crack profile , which extend earlier work by ondaruhu @xcite ,",
    "are then compared with the theoretical predictions of section [ theoretical ] .",
    "many polymers are characterized by a viscoelastic behavior , exhibiting liquid - like or solid - like responses to mechanical sollicitations , depending on the frequency range of sollicitation . for the sake of simplicity , as in refs.@xcite",
    ", we assume that the polymer material is characterized by a single relaxation time@xcite , @xmath13 , and that its rheological behavior can be described by a complex modulus @xmath14 ( we denote complex quantities with underlined variables ) , given by :    @xmath15    this expression [ rheolaw ] can depict both mechanical responses of crosslinked and uncrosslinked polymers , by taking in this last case @xmath16 ( _ i.e. _ in the absence of low - frequency elastic modulus ) . in the following ,",
    "we will discuss both cases and will use a fundamental parameter , denoted @xmath17 , characterizing the ratio between high and low - frequency elastic moduli . for a poorly cross - linked elastomer , some chains",
    "are tied by one end only ( some others might even be free ) : in this case , the low - frequency modulus @xmath3 ( related to the network ) is small , while the high - frequency modulus @xmath4 ( which contains the effects of the entangled free chains and of the dangling ends ) is high .",
    "we will thus suppose that this ratio of modulus is high , as it can be typically achieved @xcite :    @xmath18    comparing the deformation rate with the relaxation time of the material , @xmath13 , _ three _ regimes can be distinguished , as summarized in fig.1 :    \\(i ) at very low @xmath19 , _ i.e. _ @xmath20 , we have @xmath21 .",
    "the complex modulus is thus essentially real ( _ i.e. _ @xmath22 ) : the elastic component dominates , and the material can be considered a _",
    "soft solid_.    \\(ii ) for @xmath23 , we have : @xmath24 in this frequency range , where @xmath25 , the rheology is mainly viscous - type : the material is a _ liquid _ with a viscosity @xmath26 .",

    "strong solid _ with an elastic modulus @xmath28 .    during crack propagation",
    ", the strain rate imposed to the material is high near the fracture tip , and lowers as the distance @xmath29 to the head increases ( far from the tip , the material had more time to relax the stresses ) .",
    "following ref.@xcite , we thus relate the distance @xmath29 to the tip with the frequency @xmath19 by a simple scaling law of the form : @xmath30    as a consequence , we can distinguish three spatial regions in the bulk of the moving rubber , corresponding to the three regimes of frequencies defined above . in fig.2",
    "we present a simple view of the fracture profile when the crack propagates in a crosslinked polymer at speed @xmath5 .",
    "note that this graphic representation corresponds to a velocity chosen in the range @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the crack length @xcite .    directly ahead",
    "the crack tip ( located at @xmath33 ) is an adhesive zone of length @xmath34 ( assumed to be smaller than @xmath35 ) , where local dissipative processes take place @xcite , and lead to the @xmath1 term of order 1 to 10 j@xmath36m@xmath37 . in the following ,",
    "all relevant dimensions of the problem ( _ e.g. _ the crack length or the specimen dimensions in a fracture test ) will be assumed to be sufficiently large compared with the adhesive zone size . for simplicity reasons",
    ", we will also suppose this length @xmath34 constant and independent of separation rate @xmath5    close to the fracture tip , the small spatial scales correspond to high rates of deformation : this region ( number 1 in fig.2 : @xmath38 ) is a strong solid of elastic modulus @xmath4 .",
    "at intermediate distances ( region 2 : @xmath39 ) , the behavior is viscous - type : the polymer can be viewed a liquid of viscosity @xmath40 . far away",
    "the fracture head ( region 3 : @xmath41 ) , the material is a soft solid of modulus @xmath3 .",
    "a few years ago @xcite , de gennes proposed a general relation between the energy @xmath42 viscously dissipated during crack propagation at separation rate @xmath5 , and the real ( @xmath43 $ ] ) and imaginary ( @xmath44 $ ] ) parts of the complex modulus @xmath45 .",
    "let us begin with a general calculation of the energy dissipated in a viscoelastic material , within the framework of linear viscoelasticity and using the more convenient complex representation of the oscillatory motion .",
    "when the material is submitted to an oscillatory stress at frequency @xmath19 , characterized by its complex form @xmath46 , the material response , given by the complex strain , @xmath47 , is of the form : @xmath48    the energy dissipated per unit of time , and per unit of volume , is given by @xmath49 , where @xmath50 denotes the strain - rate .",

    "part [ tromp prof ] for precisions ) .",
    "we can also relate the distance to crack tip @xmath61 to local frequencies of excitation @xmath19 by the scaling relation ( [ relation omega x ] ) : @xmath62 .",
    "the integrand inside the right - hand side of eq.([tspoint general ] ) thus depends only on @xmath61 , and we can replace the integral over @xmath29 and @xmath63 ( on the half - space @xmath64 ) by an integral over @xmath61 ( from @xmath65 to @xmath66 ) , omitting numerical coefficient due to the integration over @xmath67 ( from 0 to @xmath68 ) :    @xmath69    using relation ( [ relation omega x ] ) , we turn the eq.([tspoint sinus ] ) into an integral over frequencies of solicitation :    @xmath70    the viscous dissipation @xmath58 and @xmath71 are simply related by @xmath72",
    ". finally , as the fracture energy at zero velocity @xmath1 and the applied stress intensity factor @xmath73 are related by the classical expression @xmath74 , we end up with @xcite :    @xmath75    @xmath1 is the adhesion energy due to local processes near the tip .",
    "the limiting values @xmath76 and @xmath77 define the range of frequency over which the material is excited .",
    "the analytical results derived from eq.([int expr ] ) are presented in the appendix . using the form ( [ rheolaw ] ) of the complex modulus of the material , the evolution of the total adhesion energy @xmath78 versus crack velocity can be predicted for both cases of crosslinked and uncrosslinked ( @xmath79 ) polymers . for the sake of conciseness",
    ", we will only qualitatively discuss the contribution of the different zones for @xmath71 , which contrasts with some predictions of the classical picture of viscoelastic trumpet .",
    "it was pointed out in a preceding paper @xcite that the dissipation in the liquid zone predominates for the overall dissipation ( because the liquid region is huge , ranging from @xmath80 to @xmath81 ) .",
    "this gives rise to amplification of the adhesion energy by a factor @xmath17 ( @xmath82 ) when the separation rate is taken between @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "this domain of velocities corresponds to a fully developed liquid zone , which explains the maximum of fracture energy ( as the other `` elastic '' zones do not dissipate energy in this simple view ) .",
    "in fact , it is worth noting that this enhancement begins for _ much lower separation rates_. in order to get a better understanding for the origin of this property , let us now calculate the viscous dissipation in the various regions of the bulk polymer , by estimating in each zone the value of the complex modulus : @xmath85 ( the different approximations are mentioned in fig .",
    "the crucial point here is that the integration of a _ weak _ loss modulus @xmath55 as in eq.([int expr ] ) over a _",
    "huge _ volume can give rise to an energy enhancement comparable to the viscous region one . in fig .",
    "3 , we present a simplified graphic representation of the regimes .    at _",

    ", @xmath86 , the whole polymer material behaves as a `` soft solid '' ; replacing @xmath56 and @xmath87 by their approximated expressions in eq.([int expr ] ) , we obtain :    @xmath88    thus , the ( weak ) loss modulus of the elastic region is sufficient to increase the fracture energy .",
    "the fracture energy reaches @xmath89 for a fracture speed as low as @xmath90 , even if the `` liquid zone '' has not emerged yet .    for _ intermediate separation rates _",

    "i.e. _ when the soft solid region has disappeared because of the finite dimensions of the sample .    the adhesion energy expression ( [ gv for uncross ] ) is compared with experiments in part [ gv exp uncross ] .",

    "2 ) , we know @xcite that the amplitude of stress inside an elastic material is given by :    @xmath109    where @xmath73 is the applied stress intensity factor @xcite and @xmath110 are universal functions describing the angular variation of the crack tip stress field . in particular , the normal stress vanishes on the tip , but the other stress components follow the following scaling law with respect to the distance @xmath29 to the crack tip :    @xmath111    although we are dealing here with a complex viscoelastic medium , this simple scaling form ( eq.[k1 ] ) remains valid for our problem , as the equations of motion reduce in both cases to @xmath112 , with identical compatibility conditions imposed to the stress components @xcite .",
    "the strain imposed to a fluid element of length @xmath113 is simply given by @xmath114 .",

    "where the frequencies are low ( @xmath117 ) , we recover an elastic modulus : @xmath118 .",

    "gives the expected profile in region 2 :    @xmath126    the conclusions for the _ strong solid region _ are identical to the soft one .",
    "we predict : @xmath127    greenwood and johnson @xcite investigated the precise shape of the free surfaces of a crack , by using barenblatt s approach @xcite .",
    "their conclusions agree with our qualitative picture of viscoelastic fracture : at very low speed , the crack has an elastic shape @xmath128 ( _ i.e. _ the liquid zone has not emerged yet ) ; at high speed , the profile is again purely elastic ( _ i.e. _ the bulk of the material is only a strong solid zone ) ; finally , at intermediate speeds , the three zones are present , including a central @xmath129 profile , whose extension depends on the form of the compliance function for the material .",
    "these different velocity regimes are indeed experimentally observed ( cf .",
    "7 ) , as developed below . of course",
    ", the purely elastic shape at low velocity is not observed , as there is no elastic modulus at low strain - rates for an uncrosslinked polymer .",
    "in the experimental study , we chose to use an uncrosslinked polymer instead of a poorly crosslinked elastomer .",
    "the advantage is that such a liquid adhesive gives large enough deformations to be evidenced by simple optics set - up .",
    "even if all the regimes discussed in the previous part will not be present in the experiments , the influence of viscous flow during failure was investigated in detail with in particular , the study of fracture profiles .",
    "this last point also required the use of thick adhesive layers in order to avoid additional cut - off length related to the thickness .",
    "the results presented below correspond to an adhesive thickness of 10 mm , larger than the diameter of the probe - adhesive contact area ( about 6 mm ) .",
    "the adhesive we used is an uncrosslinked polydimethylsiloxane ( pdms ) polymer ( rhodia , france ) with a large molecular weight ( m@xmath130 = 497000 , m@xmath130/m@xmath131 = 1,9 ) .",
    "it exhibits model rheological properties and has a large characteristic time ( @xmath132 0.6 s ) well suited to video recording rate .",
    "the experimental procedure is detailed in @xcite : we built a probe tack test experiment and adapted an optical set - up in order to visualize and measure the fracture profiles during the debonding process .",
    "this allowed to correlate the energy and stress measurements with the fracture propagation mechanism .",
    "an important point of our set - up is that we used a spherical probe ( a glass watch ) .",
    "this was necessary to overcome the spurious problems of parallelism met with a flat probe . with the spherical one , the fracture always propagated symmetrically .",
    "this was nearly never the case with a flat probe .",
    "note that a very small curvature is sufficient to guide the fracture radially : we used probes with a radius of curvature ( about 10 cm ) much larger than the observed deformations ( about 1 mm ) and than the radius of the probe - adhesive contact area ( about 3 mm ) . as the characteristic angle of aperture of the probe ( of order @xmath133 ) is very small compared with the opening angle of fracture ( of order @xmath134 )",
    ", we therefore assumed that it did not modify the fracture mechanism compared with a flat probe .",
    "this spherical geometry is also very convenient to lighten and get sharp images .",
    "another feature to note is that the velocity of the fracture measured on the video was constant during the propagation .",
    "the propagation speed increased only at the very end of the debonding .",
    "this is an important point in order to compare the results to the models developed at constant velocity . for every experiment we monitored the force f(t ) during the debonding and deduced by numerical integration of this curve the adhesion energy per unit surface g. we also videotaped the fracture propagation .",
    "we measured the fracture profile @xmath98 as the distance between the polymer surface and the probe .      in the following",
    "we will consider only the case of adhesive failure when the bond breaks at the polymer - probe interface . at smaller separation velocities ,",
    "the failure was cohesive as discussed in @xcite .",
    "in fig.4 we reported the adhesion energy of the bond as a function of the velocity @xmath5 of propagation of the fracture .",
    "note that the velocity @xmath5 is different from the velocity at which the probe is withdrawn .",
    "two regimes are clearly evidenced :    \\i ) at large velocities , the energy @xmath7 did not depend on the separation rate and tends towards a constant value .",
    "the fracture propagating at the adhesive - probe interface was very rapid so that the polymer has no time to flow : it has an elastic behavior . in this case",
    "the constant energy value is governed by processes occurring close to the fracture tip .",
    "\\ii ) for smaller velocities the failure was still interfacial but the energies measured are larger .",
    "as shown in @xcite this energy enhancement is caused by viscous losses in the bulk of the polymer far from the fracture tip .",
    "the fracture is slow enough to let the polymer flow .",
    "we compared the energy measurements reported in fig.4 with the model described above . from eq.([gv for uncross ] ) we deduced the expression of the fracture energy : @xmath135    as shown in fig.4 this expression describes very well the energy measurements .",
    "the energy enhancement appeared for fracture velocities lower of 5 mm@xmath36s@xmath136 which is in very good agreement with the expected value @xmath137 . in our experiment @xmath138 3 mm , @xmath139 0.6 s which gives @xmath140 5 mm@xmath36s@xmath136 . using these values",
    "we deduced from the fit the value of @xmath141 5.5 j@xmath36m@xmath37 .",
    "the fracture profiles measured in the moving frame during an experiment at v = 2 mm@xmath36s@xmath136 corresponding to the viscoelastic regime are represented in fig.5  . at the beginning of the propagation",
    "the profile was parabolic @xmath142 as evidenced in the logarithmic representation ( fig.6 ) .",
    "as the propagation proceeded we noted an important modification of the profile : close to the fracture tip the profile is still parabolic but we observe a change in the concavity of the profile far from the fracture tip .",
    "for @xmath29 larger than about 1 mm the profile is described by a power law larger than 1/2 .",
    "this distance is in good agreement with the @xmath143 1.2 mm distance expected in the theoretical part as the transition between solid and liquid zones .",
    "all these profiles coming from a single experiment corresponds qualitatively to the trumpet profile discussed in detail above .",
    "it was then interesting to compare profiles of experiments coming from the two distinct regimes : elastic and viscoelastic .",
    "in fig.7 , we superposed two profiles obtained at about 2/3 of the fracture propagation for an experiment in the elastic regime ( @xmath144 14.5 mm@xmath36s@xmath136 , @xmath145 ) and an experiment in the viscoelastic regime ( @xmath146 3.9 mm@xmath36s@xmath136 , @xmath147 ) .",
    "this latter profile is similar to the ones reported in fig.5 except that the transition from elastic to viscous profile occurs for a larger distance @xmath148 mm which is still in good agreement with the @xmath149 2.3 mm value . as for the profile in the elastic regime ,",
    "the profiles are identical close to the fracture tip but differ in the far field region . in the elastic case",
    "the fracture propagation is so rapid that the polymer remains elastic .",
    "the value of @xmath149 8.7 mm is larger than the contact size . during all the propagation",
    "the fracture profile is described by the parabolic profile @xmath128 ( see fig.8 ) .",
    "the difference between the two curves of fig.7 materializes the viscous flow which is responsible for the energy enhancement obtained in the viscoelastic regime .",
    "all these results verify qualitatively the picture of the trumpet profile schematized in fig.2 ( except for the soft solid zone which is not present with a liquid polymer ) .",
    "however , the range of distances available experimentally was not sufficient to clearly observe the @xmath129 characteristic of the liquid zone .",
    "we only observed a transition regime that can be large because , in such systems , the transition between solid and liquid behavior extends over several orders of magnitude of solicitation rate .    in order to make more quantitative comparison we tried to fit the fracture profiles with eq.([form pgg ] ) which gives a direct relation between the fracture profile @xmath98 and the rheological property @xmath150 of the adhesive .",
    "the rheological data @xmath151 and @xmath87 were measured using a rheometrix rda2 machine . for each point of the profile , we calculated the corresponding pulsation @xmath152 where @xmath5 is the fracture velocity and determined the corresponding modulus @xmath150 . the profiles @xmath98 were determined as explained above .",
    "we tested two methods to derivate the profiles : a numerical derivation or a fit by a polynomial function followed by an analytical derivation .",
    "these two methods gave the same results within a 10% uncertainty .",
    "we preferred the numerical method because the polynomial fit was not perfect close to the fracture tip .    in fig.9 we reported , for every profile of figs.5 and 7 the value of @xmath153 as a function of @xmath29 .",
    "we observe that the curves corresponding to the different profiles fit on a same curve .",
    "the parabolic profiles of fig.5 observed at the beginning of the propagation as well as the `` trumpet '' profiles that develop after a given time give the same power law in this representation .",
    "it is also the case for the profiles of fig.7 coming from different types of fracture propagation .",
    "in fact , eq.([form pgg ] ) holds for all conditions of solicitation .",
    "the stress intensity factor @xmath73 characterizes the strength of the bond and is directly related to @xmath1 by :    @xmath154    both parameters @xmath1 and @xmath73 describe processes occurring at the fracture tip and therefore depend only on the preparation of the bond .",
    "all the experiments of fig.4 thus correspond to a same value of @xmath73 .",
    "the far field losses induced an enhancement of the energy in the viscoelastic regime but did not modify the stress distribution in the adhesive .",
    "for that reason , the profiles of figs.5 - 8 , in the elastic as well as in the viscoelastic regimes , coincide in the representation @xmath155 versus @xmath29 .",
    "the power law deduced from fig.9 is @xmath156 in rather good agreement with the @xmath157 expected from eq.([form pgg ] ) .",
    "the deduced value of the stress intensity factor is @xmath158 18000 n@xmath36m@xmath159 .",
    "the value @xmath141 3 j@xmath36m@xmath37 deduced from the profiles according to eq.([thierry ] ) is of the order of the value @xmath141 5.5 j@xmath36m@xmath37 deduced from adhesion energy measurements .",
    "all these experimental results validate the picture of the trumpet profile and its influence on the adhesion energy of a viscoelastic polymer .",
    "in conclusion , we proposed a qualitative description of the dissipative processes occurring during the failure of the interface between a viscoelastic material and a solid substrate , mainly based on de gennes initial approach @xcite .",
    "in particular , we analyzed the enhancement of fracture energy due to far - field viscous dissipation in the bulk material .",
    "the results of our scaling analysis are in accordance with the more rigorous ones of hui _",
    "_ @xcite and greenwood _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "we have shown that , for a crosslinked elastomer , the interface toughness @xmath0 starts from a relatively low value @xmath1 due to local dissipative processes near the crack tip , and reaches a maximum of order @xmath2 ( see eq.[rheolaw ] ) .",
    "it was shown that our simple model accounts well for the dependence of fracture energy @xmath0 for a polymer melt , for which the fracture energy should scale as @xmath6 .",
    "the two velocity regimes , and the peculiar crack profiles experimentally observed validate our description in two zones : an elastic region near the crack tip , and a liquid zone with a different concavity at distances larger than @xmath160 ( where the material had enough time to flow ) .",
    "the `` viscoelastic trumpet '' model @xcite is thus a simple , tractable , linear model which describes well , on the basis of viscoelasticity , the viscous origin of fracture energy enhancement observed in many systems .",
    "our aim here is to point out that the fracture energy originating from viscous dissipation in the bulk polymer had been underestimated at low velocities .",
    "some experiments measuring the quantity @xmath1 for elastomers , by taking a crack velocity as small as practically possible , which obtain too large values for @xmath1 , may thus be reassessed by taking into account the viscous dissipation existing in large volumes of soft elastic regions .    to conclude ,",
    "let us insist on the fact that this `` viscoelastic trumpet '' model is a qualitative approach of a very complex phenomenon , and lies on many approximations : in particular , the independence versus @xmath5 of the adhesive zone scale @xmath34 , and of the associated dissipation term @xmath1 , is obviously discutable as it has been proved that for many systems @xmath1 exhibits a marked dependence on @xmath5 , and most of the rate dependence of @xmath0 then originates from the rate dependence of @xmath1 itself @xcite .",
    "we can thus expect our model to apply to systems characterized by a relatively weak adhesion , for which @xmath1 ( and subsequently @xmath34 ) is effectively quasi - independent on @xmath5 : this is the case of the very high molecular weight pdms studied in the experimental section ( at short times , or high separation rates , this type of material behaves elastically and does not dissipate much near the crack tip , as a consequence of its very low glass transition temperature ) .",
    "most of other uncrosslinked systems are characterized by an increasing dissipation with increasing velocity , even in the elastic regime @xcite , because the increase in @xmath1 dominates when the adhesion hysteresis is large and the material is soft , even when the polymer is macroscopically elastic @xcite .",
    "a more realistic description of the microscopic processes taking place in the adhesive zone , including nonlinear effects and specific properties like crack blunting @xcite for very soft materials ( characterized by a weak elastic modulus @xmath161 mpa ) , represents a theoretical challenge , and a possible further extension of our simplistic model .",

    "following the notations @xmath162 , @xmath163 and @xmath40 introduced in fig.10 , it can easily be shown that the applied stress @xmath164 and the strain @xmath165 are related by the following differential equation :                  [ [ fracture-energy-gv-derived-from-the-integral-expression-eq.int-expr ] ] fracture energy @xmath0 derived from the integral expression eq.[int expr ] ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                as pointed out before , the viscoelastic effect gives a multiplicative enhancement of the energy @xmath1 dissipated by local processes in the adhesive zone .",
    "the multiplicative factor , of order @xmath177 , depends on the degree of cross - linking : a higher crosslinkage induces an increase in @xmath3 and therefore a decrease in energy of adhesion , as shown by gent and petrich @xcite .",
