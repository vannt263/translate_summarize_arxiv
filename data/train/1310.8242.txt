    "passive magnetic shielding systems typically use a concentric arrangement of thin shells of a high permeability material to divert magnetic field lines around a region of interest .",
    "the region within the shielding system consequently possesses a reduced local magnetic field .",
    "while magnetic shielding is useful for a variety of applications , the most stringent requirements are found in high precision experiments where the limits of magnetometry technology are experienced or are themselves being studied .",
    "some recent examples are in biomagnetism  @xcite , electric dipole moment experiments  @xcite , and in developments of the most precise atomic magnetometers  @xcite .",
    "neutron electic dipole moment ( edm ) experiments in particular suffer from a systematic effect relating to the accrual of geometric phase as neutrons and comagnetometer atoms sample the experimental volume @xcite .",
    "the geometric phase effect is expected to present a dominant systematic effect in future neutron edm experiments .",
    "to first approximation , the systematic correction is proportional to the first - order gradient along the direction of the applied magnetic field @xmath0 .",
    "it is therefore important in these experiments both to limit and to characterize magnetic field gradients .",
    "while the analysis and development of single- and multi - layer magnetic shields has been an important and active area of research for well over a century  @xcite@xmath1@xcite , the focus in analytical treatments has been almost exclusively on shielding uniform magnetic fields . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "only urankar and oppelt  @xcite have explored the issue of passive magnetic shielding in gradient fields from an analytical perspective .",
    "sumner _ et al . _",
    "@xcite provide an excellent overview of the history of the field of magnetic shielding .",
    "exact solutions for concentric cylindrical and spherical shields @xcite have been simplified to approximate formulae valid in the limit of high magnetic permeability and thin shells  @xcite as well as to provide axial shielding factors for cylindrical geometries .",
    "more recently , axial shielding in relation to shield spacing , end cap holes , and gaps between mating surfaces has been explored numerically  @xcite .",
    "analytic treatments of the quasi - static solutions have led to developments in external active compensation  @xcite .    however , as mentioned above , these authors considered only uniform applied fields .",
    "urankar and oppelt  @xcite analyzed the general multipole field ( both as an external and internal source ) for single spherical shields , and provided general shielding and reaction factors .",
    "they employed their the results to analyze active magnetic compensation used in conjunction with magnetically shielded rooms .",
    "quasi - static solutions valid in the dc limit were provided .",
    "we extend this work ( in the dc limit ) to multi - layer shields with spherical as well as infinite cylindrical geometry .",
    "for each , we consider the following situations :    1 .   _",
    "externally applied fields .",
    "_ calculations are included both single and multi - layer shields .",
    "the shielding factor for general multipole fields is calculated internal to the innermost shield and is of principal interest .",
    "the field external to the outermost shield is also calculated , and is useful for designing active magnetic compensation systems .",
    "this field is dominated by the response of the outermost layer and the analysis is restricted to a single shield only .",
    "internally applied fields .",
    "_ in many cases , such as in edm experiments , a highly homogeneous internal field is desired and this is generally supplied by a coil system internal to a set of magnetic shields .",
    "we consider here the impact of the innermost magnetic shield on general internally produced multipole fields , and calculate reaction factors by which the field internal to the coil system is amplified .",
    "we comment here on our primary new results :    * we report shielding factors , interior reaction factors , and exterior response fields for single layer , infinite cylindrical magnetic shields , exposed to general multipole dc applied fields .",
    "this extends the work of ref .",
    "@xcite from spherical to cylindrical geometries ; for the spherical case , we demonstrate agreement with ref .  @xcite .",
    "our results for single - layer shields are useful for designing active magnetic compensation systems ( in the case of exterior response fields ) and internal coil systems ( in the case of interior reaction factors ) , and we provide useful examples of this . * we provide shielding factors for multi - layer shields in both cylindrical and spherical geometries for general multipole fields .",
    "one of our primary results is that higher multipole fields are always shielded better than the homogeneous field , a general result that should prove useful in applications requiring homogeneous fields .",
    "this extends previous work to general multipole fields , and extends the work of ref .",
    "@xcite to multi - layer shielding systems in the dc limit .",
    "* finally , we use a somewhat unique method of solution compared to previous authors , in that we consider the equivalent problem of bound surface currents . while the end results are of course equivalent , our approach may be useful in certain situations .",
    "we found , for example , that the consideration of surface currents gives a more direct conceptual link to the coils and current structures that one ultimately uses .",
    "our work is valid for dc fields , general multipole sources ( both internal and external to the magnetic shield ) , and any number of concentric shields ( cylindrical or spherical ) .",
    "we provide an exact treatment valid for shields of any permeability @xmath2 and thickness .",
    "we also provide new approximate formulae in the high-@xmath2 , thin shell limit , which we have now validated for all higher multipoles .",
    "we proceed first by describing our general method and then the cylindrical and spherical applications of the method .",
    "we conclude with applications to some geometries of interest in edm experiments , which as noted above have very stringent requirements for magnetic field quality .",
    "two problems of particular geometry are solved here using standard cylindrical and spherical coordinates : ( i ) the interaction of the transverse , 2-dimensional magnetic field @xmath3 with infinitely - long cylindrical shells , and ( ii ) the interaction of the general magnetic field @xmath4 with spherical shells .",
    "as is commonly done to achieve analytic solutions for passive shielding problems , we restrict our analysis to shields of linear , homogeneous media , carrying no free current . under such conditions ,",
    "the response of a permeable object to an applied magnetic field can be re - cast solely in terms of bound surface current @xmath5 on the surfaces of the object . as a result , we take advantage of known formulae for the magnetic fields of cylindrical and spherical sheet currents  @xcite to solve the appropriate boundary conditions for sets of concentric magnetic shields .    for a shielding system of @xmath6 concentric shells ,",
