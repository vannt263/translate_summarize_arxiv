    "<S> the appearance of a few exponents in an optical correlation function seems to be typical for many - body correlated systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the most interesting exponent is the second exponent showing values of about -0.8 . </S>",
    "<S> we relate this to a correlated low temperature many body phase of a two - dimensional dipolar liquid of parallel oriented excitons as theoretically predicted in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this power law rather abruptly disappears at @xmath47 5k [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](e ) ] . as predicted in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite a correlated dipolar liquid is expected only at sufficiently low temperature and high enough trapped ix densities and should exhibits a rather gradual transition .     </S>",
    "<S> ( color online ) ( a ) pl spectra , for different laser powers , detected from center of the trap . </S>",
    "<S> pl intensity is normalized to @xmath21 and the spectra are energetically shifted such that the fermi - edge - like steepest slope in the pl vs. @xmath42 spectra is at @xmath48 ( original spectra see @xcite ) . </S>",

    "<S> ( c ) second exponent @xmath46 ( left axis ) and linewidth ( right axis ) as a function of @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> ( d ) an upper limit is shown for @xmath36 [ @xmath15 = 0.70v , @xmath13 = 0.32v , @xmath14 = 0.35v , @xmath20 = 243mk , @xmath22 = 1.4289ev].,width=325 ]    we further investigate the pl spectra as a function of the exciton density , varied by changing the exciting laser power . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](a ) , the pl intensity , normalized to the laser power , is plotted versus energy relative to the blue edge energy @xmath50 at which the pl intensity drops to half of the maximum value ( original spectra see @xcite ) . around the pl maximum , the intensity rises more steeply than laser power @xmath21 . using the blue shift @xmath49 of the pl maximum with increasing laser power as a measure of the exciton density </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the density dependence of the integrated pl intensity shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](b ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that only a part of the nonlinear increasing pl intensity can be explained by a decreasing ix lifetime @xcite . for @xmath51 1.2@xmath12w , </S>",
    "<S> we observe a decreasing linewidth with rising exciton density [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](c ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> a related observation in quantum wells was recently associated with screening of the disorder potential by repulsive ix - ix interaction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the density dependent decrease of the linewidth is accompanied by finding the exponent -@xmath7 -0.8 in the @xmath45-@xmath45 plot of the red tail [ fig .  </S>",

    "<S> we find at low temperatures the exponent -@xmath7 -0.8 in the temperature - dependent spectra [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](e ) ] which supports the our that this power law is associated with a correlated dipolar liquid . with increasing exciton density the dipolar interaction energies of the ix sum up to the observed blue shift @xmath49 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the lineshape asymmetry thus can be interpreted as a broadened sum of individual excitonic transitions . in related studies on electrostatic traps fabricated on the same ingaas heterostructure with an effective trap diameter of down to about 100 nm and thus a trap area of roughly 1000 times smaller than those considered here , </S>",
    "<S> we observe discrete individual lines of linewidth below 0.5mev which depend on laser power as characteristic for single excitons , biexcitons and triexcitons , respectively . further increasing the trap population , </S>",
    "<S> these merge at low temperatures into an asymmetric lineshape thus lending additional support to the interpretation given here in terms of correlated behavior . at high laser powers , the extracted exponent @xmath46 starts to oscillate due to an interference substructure overlaying the pl lineshape [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](c ) , for details see @xcite ] and we see an expected homogeneous broadening @xcite of the pl line caused by exciton - exciton scattering with increasing exciton density . from the blue side of the pl </S>",
    "<S> lineshape we extract a rising upper limit for the apparent exciton gas temperature @xmath36 [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](d ) ] .    in conclusion , at temperatures and densities at which the thermal de broglie wavelength ( @xmath52 nm at 2k ) is larger than the interexcitonic distance @xmath53 nm @xcite at @xmath54 we observe a characteristic temperature and density - dependent transition to a specific quantum state of the ix ensemble . in this regime , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath32 is comparable to twice the effective excitonic bohr radius @xmath31 20 nm @xcite as well as the qw separation ( @xmath55 17 nm ) . from the appearance of the strongly increasing integrated pl intensity as well as a pl linewidth decreasing with increasing density , </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that this state reflects a correlated many - body state mediated by dipole - dipole interactions . in the analysis of the red tail of the pl lineshape we observe at @xmath56 5k a characteristic power law dependence of the pl intensity reflected in exponent -@xmath7 -0.8 , associated with an energy between 1.5mev and 4 mev . </S>",
    "<S> this we interpret as a generic fingerprint of dipolar many - body correlations . </S>",
    "<S> a theoretical understanding of this power law can not be given at present but this very interesting observation in our opinion should motivate further theoretical and experimental studies in the field .    </S>",
