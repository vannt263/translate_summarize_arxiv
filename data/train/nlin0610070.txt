    "over the last decade , the topic of nonlinear dynamical lattices and of the coherent structures that arise in them has attracted considerable attention .",
    "this can be mainly attributed to a diverse set of research themes where the corresponding mathematical models have emerged as an appropriate description of the physical problem .",
    "such areas include , but are not limited to , arrays of nonlinear - optical waveguides @xcite and photorefractive crystal lattices @xcite , bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) trapped in optical lattices ( ols ) @xcite , josephson - junction ladders @xcite , micro - mechanical models of cantilever arrays @xcite or even simple models of the complex dynamics of the dna double strand @xcite .",
    "these , in turn , have spurted an increasing mathematical interest in hamiltonian discrete systems and produced a considerable volume of theoretical results , which has partially been summarized in the reviews @xcite .",
    "arguably , the most prototypical among the discrete nonlinear hamiltonian models is the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation ( dnls ) @xcite , which results from a centered - difference discretization of its famous continuum analog , the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) @xcite .",
    "the dnls arises most notably in the nonlinear optics of waveguide arrays , where it was developed @xcite as an envelope wave description of the electric field in each of the waveguides .",
    "it was also systematically derived as a tight - binding model for bose - einstein condensates trapped in , so - called , optical lattices @xcite .",
    "in other settings , such as e.g. photorefractive crystals , the validity of the dnls model is more limited , yet still a lot of its qualitative features can be observed even experimentally .",
    "it is for this reason that this simple yet rich model has been used to justify numerous experimental observations in the above - mentioned areas , including the formation of discrete solitons @xcite , the existence of peierls - nabarro barriers for such waves @xcite , the modulational instability of uniform states both in optical @xcite and in bec @xcite experiments , and the formation of discrete vortices @xcite in two - dimensions , among many others . in the earlier work of @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we studied systematically the solutions that can be obtained in the one- and two - dimensional installments of the model respectively , using a combination of methods of lyapunov - schmidt reductions and perturbation theory in the , so - called , anti - continuum limit of lattice sites uncoupled with each other .    in the present paper , we provide a mathematical framework and a symbolic package for the systematic computations of the existence and the stability of localized states in the fully three - dimensional dnls model .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , this is the first time that systematic stability results are developed for the three - dimensional system .",
    "earlier numerical work in @xcite revealed a considerable wealth of possible states , including octupoles , diamonds and vortex cubes , among many others .",
    "it is these states and different variants thereof that our systematic methodology addresses in the present publication , by formulating a symbolic approach that can be straightforwardly used to study the potential persistence and linear stability of _ any _ desired configuration .",
    "our results on the three - dimensional dnls model can not be applied to dynamics of waveguide arrays since the third spatial direction in the optical problem represents the evolution time variable . however , the model is still relevant to becs and an additional possibility for its physical realization is offered by a three - dimensional crystal built of microresonators @xcite .",
    "our article is structured as follows .",
    "section 2 formulates the mathematical problem of interest .",
    "section 3 presents the main results for the development of the computational algorithm based on the lyapunov ",
    "schmidt reduction method .",
    "section 4 reports the application of the computational algorithm to three kinds of three - dimensional vortex configurations .",
    "section 5 compares these results with direct numerical bifurcation results of the three - dimensional dnls model .",
    "section 6 concludes the paper .",
    "appendix a contains typical outputs of the mathematica software package .",

    "the main benefit of the present paper is that it provides a systematic computational approach , based on a symbolic mathematical package to unravel the existence and linear stability of any configuration of interest in a three - dimensional lattice that is of paramount interest in a wide range of applications .",
    "the package implements the conditions of the lyapunov - schmidt reduction method that are necessary and , in the case of convergence , sufficient for persistence of relevant configurations .",
    "the reductions start from the anti - continuum limit of the lattice and extend the solution with respect to the coupling parameter @xmath181 .",
    "the algorithm subsequently connects the leading - order behavior of the small eigenvalues of the stability problem ( which bifurcate from the zero eigenvalue at @xmath38 and are responsible for the instability of the vortex configurations ) to the jacobian matrix of the above conditions . in so doing , it provides a powerful predictor that we have always found to be accurate for small values of the coupling parameter ( typically for @xmath348 ) .",
