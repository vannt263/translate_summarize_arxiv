    "nowadays the studies of chiral asymmetry in magnetized relativistic matter has drawn attention of researchers across diverse areas in physics .",
    "heavy - ion collisions @xcite , compact stars @xcite , the early universe @xcite , and dirac / weyl semimetals @xcite are the main physical systems where such studies are relevant . the principal role in generating a chiral asymmetry in relativistic matter with usual vectorlike gauge interactions is played by an external magnetic field @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , it is the lowest landau level ( lll ) that is primarily responsible for the generation of chiral asymmetry in magnetized relativistic matter .",
    "the lll is special because it has fermion spins completely polarized : they are directed along the magnetic field for a positive charge and opposite to the field for a negative one . for massless or ultrarelativistic particles ,",
    "it is more appropriate to talk about their helicity rather than spin .",
    "since the helicity of massless particles is the same as their chirality and the chiralities of the left- and right - handed particles are opposite , it is easy to understand how a nondissipative axial current @xmath1 is generated in magnetized relativistic fermion matter at nonzero chemical potential @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this result is known in the literature as the chiral separation effect ( cse ) ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) and only the lowest landau level contributes to the axial current in the free theory @xcite .    the chiral magnetic effect ( cme ) @xcite is in a sense a dual phenomenon to the chiral separation effect .",
    "the cme implies that the chiral asymmetry in magnetized relativistic matter , e.g. , described by a nonvanishing chiral chemical potential @xmath3 , causes a nondissipative electric current @xmath4 .",
    "( see , however , the recent holographic study in ref .",
    "@xcite , which points some fundamental differences between the realization of the cme and cse . )",
    "moreover , an interplay of the chiral separation and chiral magnetic effects gives rise to a novel type of collective gapless excitations : the chiral magnetic wave ( cmw ) @xcite .",
    "indeed , according to the cse , a local fluctuation of the electric charge density induces a local fluctuation of the axial current .",
    "the resulting fluctuation of the chiral chemical potential produces a local fluctuation of the electric current via the cme .",
    "the latter in turn leads again to a local fluctuation of electric charge density and thus provides a self - sustaining mechanism for the propagation of a chiral magnetic wave . in heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "such a wave leads to the quadrupole cme @xcite .",
    "one of the observable implications of the latter is the splitting of the elliptic flows of positively and negatively charged pions , i.e. , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the net charge asymmetry @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the slope parameter @xcite .",
    "such a splitting was observed by the star collaboration @xcite and appears to be in agreement with theoretical predictions .",
    "apart from the cse and cme , there also exist other related anomalous transport phenomena , e.g. , the chiral vortical effect ( cve ) @xcite , the chiral electric effect ( cee ) @xcite , and the chiral charge generation effect ( ccge ) @xcite . in the free theory ,",
    "these effects can be directly deduced from the chiral and gravitational anomalies .",
    "the chiral anomaly @xcite describes the violation of the classically conserved chiral symmetry at the quantum level .",
    "it should be noted that in the presence of an external magnetic field the chiral anomaly is generated entirely on the lowest landau level @xcite .",
    "it is essential that the operator relation for the chiral anomaly is one - loop exact and can not get any higher - order radiative corrections @xcite .",
    "since the chiral anomalous effects in the free theory are generated by the quantum anomalies , it was argued in refs .",
    "@xcite that the one - loop results for the anomalous transport coefficients should be exact .",
    "one should keep in mind , however , that in order to get these anomalous transport coefficients one should calculate the ground state expectation values of the corresponding operator relations .",
    "therefore , _ a priori _ there is no guarantee that interaction corrections should be absent",
    ".    the first studies of the interaction effects were done in refs .",
    "@xcite in the framework of the dense nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model in a magnetic field . using the method of schwinger  dyson equation for the fermion propagator , it was found that the interaction between the fermions in lll and higher landau levels promotes the chiral asymmetry from the lll to all landau levels @xcite . for a magnetic field",
    "directed along the positive @xmath9-axis , dynamically generated chiral shift parameter @xmath10 enters the effective action as the @xmath11 term and produces an additional dynamical contribution to the axial current .",
    "it should be emphasized that since this term does not break any symmetry in dense relativistic matter in a magnetic field , the chiral shift is already generated in the perturbation theory @xcite . in the njl model",
    "the chiral shift takes a constant value independent of the momentum and the landau level index . in the chiral limit",
    ", it determines the relative shift of the momenta in the dispersion relations of opposite chirality fermions @xmath12 , where the momentum @xmath13 is directed along the magnetic field .",
    "in other words , it splits the dirac point into two weyl nodes separated in momentum space by @xmath14 .",
    "it was proposed , therefore , that the same mechanism should take place in dirac semimetals at nonzero charge density : in a magnetic field they transform into weyl semimetals @xcite .",
    "direct quantum - field theoretical calculations performed in dense qed to the leading order in coupling and the external magnetic field @xcite showed that the axial current in the cse receives nontrivial radiative corrections .",
    "it was found that , in the weak - field limit , the radiative corrections to the cse originate from the singularities at the fermi surface .",
    "( the radiative corrections to the chiral vorticity conductivity connected with the cve were calculated in refs .",
    "@xcite . ) the role of the interaction effects and radiative corrections in various chiral anomalous effects in magnetized relativistic matter were recently discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .    by calculating the electron self - energy in magnetized qed plasma to the leading order in the coupling constant and the external magnetic field ,",
    "it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite that the chiral asymmetry of the normal ground state of the system is characterized by two distinct dirac structures . while one of them is the chiral shift familiar from the njl model studies ,",
    "the other dirac structure is new .",
    "it formally looks like that of the chiral chemical potential but is an odd function of the longitudinal component of the momentum ( i.e. , directed along the magnetic field ) .",
    "the origin of this new parity - even chiral structure is directly connected with the long - range character of the qed interaction .",
    "the calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite were performed in the weak magnetic field approximation , using the pseudomomentum representation .",
    "recently , the same pseudomomentum representation was also tested in the problem of chiral symmetry breaking in qcd at zero baryon density @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the fermion self - energy ( as well as the chiral asymmetry functions ) in the weak - field limit @xcite revealed an infrared logarithmic singularity .",
    "this feature may well be an artifact of the expansion in powers of the magnetic field .",
    "it may also be related to yet another problem . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the weak - field result for the axial current density depends on the photon mass which is introduced as an infrared regulator .",
    "it was argued , however , that such a dependence is fictitious and is expected to go away after taking into account the nonperturbative corrections beyond the weak - field limit . as a first step in the direction of resolving the limitations of the weak - field expansion @xcite , in this paper we study the fermion self - energy and chiral asymmetry in cold magnetized qed plasma in the landau level representation .",

    "[ sec : model ] , we briefly introduce the model and notations .",

    "following closely the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite , we start from the following lagrangian density of qed in an external magnetic field : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the covariant derivative , @xmath2 is the fermion chemical potential , and @xmath17 is the bare fermion mass . note that the notation is similar to that of ref .",

    ". the components of the spatial vectors , including those of the vector potential @xmath19 , are identified with the _ contravariant _ components .",

    "is broken .",
    "this is obvious because , for one - particle states of charged fermions , the momentum perpendicular to the magnetic field is not a good quantum number .",
    "the absence of the translational invariance is reflected in the structure of the fermion propagator @xcite , i.e. , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a space - time four - vector , @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the schwinger phase , and @xmath27 is the translation invariant part of the propagator . a similar form is valid for the inverse fermion propagator as well @xcite , i.e. , @xmath28 it should be emphasized , though , that the translation invariant part @xmath29 is not the inverse of @xmath27 .",
    "as proposed in the previous study @xcite , the chiral asymmetry of the dense qed in a magnetic field is captured by the structure of the fermion self - energy . to leading order in coupling constant @xmath30 ,",
    "the corresponding expression for the self - energy in coordinate space reads @xmath31 by taking into account the structure of the propagator in eq .",

    "( [ self - energy ] ) and performing the fourier transform , we arrive at the following pseudomomentum representation for the translation invariant part of the self - energy : @xmath33 here @xmath34 is the fourier transform of the translation invariant part of the fermion propagator , and @xmath35 is the momentum space representation for the photon propagator .    in the study at hand , we are interested in properties of cold qed matter at nonzero density .",
    "moreover , we assume that the fermion number density is large , i.e. , the corresponding value of the chemical @xmath2 is much larger than other energy scales in the problem .",
    "in particular , we assume that @xmath36 , which is a reasonable hierarchy , for example , in the case of electron plasma in magnetars .",

    "let us briefly describe the algorithm that we use in the calculations .",
    "the four - dimensional integrals that define the chiral asymmetry functions have the following schematic form : @xmath86 in order to calculate such an integral , we will make use of the importance sampling monte carlo method @xcite . in such a framework ,",
    "the result of the integration is approximated by a weighted sum of contributions calculated at a large number of random points in the phase space , i.e. , @xmath87 having limited information about the angular dependence of the integrand function , we use the simplest uniform distribution of the random variable @xmath88 on the interval from @xmath89 to @xmath90 .",
    "the other three random number variables are distributed with the probability density functions @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 , respectively .",

    "this is where importance sampling can improve the situation .",
    "the key observation is that , for a fixed number of sampling points @xmath95 , the result for the above statistical error depends on the random number distributions used . the error becomes smaller when the corresponding probability densities approximate closer the integrand function itself .",
    "the same condition determines when the fastest convergence of the monte carlo method is achieved .    while testing our numerical algorithm , we tried performing calculations with several different types of the functional forms for the random number distributions ( e.g. , gaussian and gamma distributions ) and examined a number of different choices of their parameters . in such tests ,",

    "<S> the interaction induced chiral asymmetry is calculated in cold qed plasma beyond the weak - field approximation . by making use of the recently developed landau - level representation for the fermion self - energy , the chiral shift and the parity - even chiral chemical potential function </S>",
    "<S> are obtained with the help of numerical methods . </S>",
    "<S> the results are used to quantify the chiral asymmetry of the fermi surface in dense qed matter . </S>",
    "<S> because of the weakness of the qed interactions , the value of the asymmetry appears to be rather small even in the strongest magnetic fields and at the highest stellar densities . </S>",
    "<S> however , the analogous asymmetry can be substantial in the case of dense quark matter . </S>"
