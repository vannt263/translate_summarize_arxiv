    "in 1981 , guth @xcite proposed an inflationary phase of the early universe to solve several glaring paradoxes of the standard cosmology : the horizon , flatness , and monopole problems . during the inflationary epoch , the friedmann equation @xmath1 is dominated on the right hand side by a ( nearly constant ) false vacuum energy term @xmath2 _ constant_. here @xmath3 = @xmath4 is the hubble parameter and @xmath5 , the scale factor of the universe , expands superluminally , @xmath6 with @xmath7 . during this period",
    ", a small causally connected region of the universe inflates to a sufficiently large scale ( the scale factor must increase by about @xmath8 or roughly 60 @xmath9-folds of inflation ) to successfully resolve these cosmological shortcomings .",
    "since the period of superluminal expansion is an adiabatic process , the temperature of the universe drops precipitously during this phase .",
    "hence , it must be followed by a period of thermalization , in which the vacuum energy density is converted to radiation leading to the standard cosmology .",
    "inflationary models can be divided into two categories : old inflation - type models , in which a scalar field tunnels from false to true vacuum during a first order phase transition , and slowly rolling inflation models , in which a scalar field rolls down a flat potential to its minimum . in either case , the vacuum energy density of the field before it reaches its minimum drives the inflationary expansion .    in chain inflation",
    ", we generalize the variety of possible models by considering a sequential chain of a large number of tunneling and/or rolling fields , in which reheating relies on the coupling between the fields .",
    "this chain of multiple tunnelers can be interpreted as a path in a multidimensional potential landscape , @xmath10 ) , such as may exist in the stringy landscape , where @xmath11 is the number of fields .",
    "one can think of this path as starting at a bowl ( a local minimum ) in this multidimensional parameter space , then moving down to a sequence of bowls of ever lower energy , until one reaches the ground state with zero potential .",
    "we can model this such that each drop to a lower bowl is equivalent to one of the fields tunneling .",
    "* shortcomings of previous inflationary models : * any successful inflationary model must meet two key requirements : 1 ) there must be sufficient inflation , and 2 ) the universe must thermalize and reheat . the original old inflation model , in which bubbles of true vacuum nucleate in a false vacuum background , failed @xcite because the interiors of expanding spherical bubbles of true vacuum can not thermalize : the `` graceful exit '' problem .",
    "hence this model does not produce a universe such as our own . shortly after the demise of old inflation , models with slowly rolling fields",
    "were proposed @xcite . as a scalar field slowly rolls down its potential , superluminal expansion is achieved .",
    "reheating then takes place successfully as the field oscillates around its minimum and decays to radiation .",
    "however , slowly rolling models typically suffer from fine - tuning of their potentials in order that they be flat enough to provide sufficient inflation and yet not overproduce density fluctuations ; we note that natural inflation @xcite is a model in which the required small parameters arise naturally .    * overcoming the shortcomings with chain inflation : * the new framework of chain inflation has several attractive features .",
    "first , it can resurrect the basic idea of tunneling inflation ( as in old inflation ) in that multiple coupled tunneling fields can achieve graceful exit .",
    "second , no fine - tuned parameters are required for the potentials ( unlike the case of most slowly - rolling models ) .",
    "third , the model is quite generic ; it succeeds for a wide variety of parameters and couplings . in particular",
    ", chain inflation succeeds for a wide variety of energy scales , ranging from 10 mev to grand unified scales ( @xmath0gev ) .",
    "fourth , it relies upon the fact that the fields are coupled to one another , which , in general , they probably are .",
    "we will illustrate these features in the paper .",
    "the idea of taking seriously a model of inflation relying upon hundreds ( or more ) of scalar fields was motivated by the large number of vacua in the string theory landscape .    unlike old inflation , by having a chain of multiple fields tunneling sequentially , we are able to fulfill both requirements for inflation : sixty e - folds of inflation as well as reheating .",
    "the key element is that no single stage of inflation is responsible for much inflation .",
    "each stage of inflation gives rise to only a fraction of an e - fold , and it is only due to the large number of stages of tunneling that the universe inflates sufficiently .",
    "graceful exit from inflation is obtained by coupling the fields together .",
    "once a field has tunneled to its true vacuum , its coupling to secondary field(s ) causes a change in the nucleation rate in the secondary field(s ) ; the rapid tunneling of the secondary field(s ) to the true vacuum allows bubble percolation and reheating .",
    "a chain of such tunneling events , each catalyzed by a previous tunneler , leads to a homogeneous hot universe .    in chain inflation",
    ", the possible range of the energy scales of the potentials can vary between @xmath0 gev down to any energy scale that allows sufficient reheating and baryogenesis .",
    "thus the potential can have an energy scale possibly as low as 10 mev , so that the universe can reheat to that energy scale and still experience ordinary big bang nucleosynthesis . in short , whereas most traditional rolling models of inflation require large energy scales , often above a planck scale , in chain inflation it is possible for all the potentials to have much lower energies , e.g. , they can all have tev scales .    in order to illustrate the basic scenario , we first consider a chain of @xmath11 tunneling fields , all with the same parameters . in this simple picture ,",
    "once the first field tunnels , it catalyzes the second field to tunnel ( where the second field without the coupling to the first would remain in the metastable vacuum ) , the second field catalyzes the third field to tunnel , etc .",
    "the key point is that the universe inflates a fraction of an e - fold at each stage , and the coupling ensures that the sequence of tunneling events takes place . after discussing the simplest variant of the chain",
    "in which each field is coupled only to two others ( the previous and subsequent ones in the chain ) , we turn to a more generic situation in which the potentials are allowed to have a variety of parameters and couplings exist between multiple fields . the same basic behavior  a sequence of tunneling events  ensues , as the universe chooses a path to the ground state .",
    "we also will assume that the ground state is minkowski space ( @xmath12 ) .    whether or not reheating is successful for a tunneling field depends crucially on the ratio between the expansion rate @xmath3 and the bubble - nucleation rate @xmath13 per unit volume .",
    "we can define the ratio @xmath14 roughly speaking , if @xmath15 , bubble nucleation is rare , and the universe stays trapped in the false vacuum and inflates .",
    "if @xmath16 , on the other hand , bubble nucleation is rapid , there is no further inflation , and the phase transition successfully completes via bubble percolation and thermalization .",
    "old inflation , which had a single tunneling scalar field , required @xmath17 , so that 60 efolds could be achieved ; then for a @xmath18 that is constant in time , it became impossible for nucleation ever to successfully complete .",
    "double field inflation , proposed in 1990 by adams and freese @xcite solved this problem with a time dependent nucleation rate for a single tunneling field , so that @xmath18 started out small and the universe inflated ; later due to coupling to a rolling field , @xmath18 for the tunneling field became large so that the phase transition suddenly took place and completed throughout the universe . in this paper",
    "we use some of the features of this double field model .",
    "we couple a series of tunneling fields together in such a way that each member of the chain catalyzes the next to rapidly nucleate and thermalize .    as a toy model",
    ", we will consider many scalar fields , each of which has an asymmetric double well potential .",
    "we do not mean to imply that this is a perfect model for the real potentials of these fields , but merely an illustrative example .",
    "of course the shape of the multi - dimensional potential is far more complicated than our simple picture .",
    "in addition , we do not deal with anti - de sitter vacua . despite these reservations ,",
    "our model has the advantage that it is quite generic .",
    "the basic features of the model should survive if one considers more complicated potentials .",
    "the model succeeds for a wide variety of parameters and couplings .",
    "we allow arbitrary couplings between the fields and find that their potentials do not need to be fine - tuned .",
    "hence the model has the positive feature that it succeeds for potentials that are natural in the context of field theory . to be succinct , if we take a large number of scalar fields which are coupled together and have natural potentials ( two criteria which are reasonable in the context of field theory and possibly also in the context of a landscape ) , we have the necessary conditions for inflation .",
    "the generic feature of our model is this idea that , in a complicated landscape , the system drops through a series of bowls by tunneling from one to another , until it hits the ground state .",
    "we will consider a specific form of couplings between fields in order to allow us to perform calculations and get reasonable estimates .",
    "however , we emphasize that the general idea of tunneling from bowl to bowl does _ not _ rely on the choices of potential and couplings that we use in order to present a concrete toy model .",
    "our model relies only on the one general feature of tunneling from bowl to bowl , regardless of the detailed form of the potential .",
    "since our treatment is entirely field theoretical , this work does not rely on the existence of any stringy landscape .",
    "this model may be relevant to many systems with multidimensional potentials , such as condensed matter systems or in particle physics .",
    "previous authors @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have considered multiple rolling fields , without any tunneling fields present ; our work differs in that we generically have tunneling fields in the model and in that the couplings between the fields are key to the success of the model .",
    "we note that in the future it would also be interesting to combine a number of rolling as well as tunneling fields .",
    "we also plan to shortly publish a paper considering inflation from a chain of vacua in a single field : one might imagine a tilted cosine , and in fact we find that chain inflation can succeed with the qcd axion @xcite .",
    "the case of a large number of uncoupled scalar fields was previously considered by @xcite .",
    "a chain of rolling fields as the source of inflation was considered by easther @xcite in a model he dubbed `` folded inflation . ''",
    "our work , which focuses on tunneling fields , is hence complementary to his paper .",
    "one important issue we have not yet dealt with in this paper is the question of density fluctuations .",
    "one of the outstanding successes of rolling models in inflation is that they are able to produce density fluctuations with a scale invariant spectrum . however ,",
    "unless their potentials are fine - tuned , they tend to overproduce the amplitude of the density fluctuations ( except in a few models such as natural inflation @xcite ) . in order for chain inflation to be a viable competitor to rolling models ,",
    "it too should produce density fluctuations of the right spectrum and amplitude . towards the end of the paper ( in the discussion section ) we present a partial discussion of the expected results , but far more",
    "work must be done on this important issue .",
    "we begin with a review of tunneling in double - well potentials and the failures of old inflation in section ii . in section iii ,",
    "we review the double field model , which revives the idea of old inflation . in section iv , we present the idea of chain inflation : we start with the toy model of identical tunnelers in which all the fields have potentials with identical parameters , and then generalize to coupled tunnelers with different parameters . in section",
    "v , we present several variants on the idea of a chain of tunnelers . in section",
    "vi there is a discussion ( including on the issue of density perturbations ) and we conclude in section vii .",
    "we consider a quantum field theory of a scalar field with a lagrangian of the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 is an asymmetric potential with metastable minimum @xmath21 and absolute minimum @xmath22 ( see fig .",
    "the energy difference between the vacua is @xmath23 .",
    "bubbles of true vacuum ( @xmath22 ) expand into a false vacuum ( @xmath21 ) background .     as a function of field strength .",
    "the energy difference @xmath23 between the false vacuum ( at @xmath24 ) and the true vacuum ( at @xmath25 ) provides the vacuum energy density for inflation.,width=528 ]    in the zero - temperature limit , the nucleation rate @xmath13 per unit volume for producing bubbles of true vacuum in the sea of false vacuum through quantum tunneling has the form @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the euclidean action and where @xmath28 is a determinantal factor which is generally the energy scale @xmath23 of the phase transition .",
    "guth and weinberg have shown that the probability of a point remaining in a false desitter vacuum is approximately @xmath29 where the dimensionless quantity @xmath18 is defined by @xmath30 writing eq.([eq : probds ] ) as @xmath31 , we can estimate the lifetime of the field in the metastable vacuum as roughly @xmath32    for definiteness , we consider asymmetric double well potentials as in figure ( 1 ) , @xmath33 to leading order , the metastable minimum is at @xmath34 and the absolute minimum at @xmath35 .",
    "the energy difference between minima is @xmath23 . throughout the paper",
    "we will assume that @xmath36 is not too different from 1 , as it is the most natural value of this parameter .    in the thin wall limit ,",
    "the euclidean action is @xmath37    when @xmath17 ( low nucleation efficiency ) , the phase transition proceeds slowly .",
    "the field remains in its metastable minimum and the universe inflates .",
    "however , as long as @xmath18 is small , the phase transition can not complete .",
    "bubbles of true vacuum do periodically nucleate in various places in the universe , but their production is rare and sporadic .",
    "the rate of filling the universe with true vacuum can not keep up with the exponential expansion of the false vacuum .",
    "percolation of true vacuum bubbles does not take place .",
    "the interiors of individual bubbles or the small groups of bubbles that are able to form are unable to thermalize .",
    "the latent heat of the phase transition resides entirely in the kinetic energy of the bubble walls and can not thermalize the interior .",
    "the universe ends up looking like `` swiss cheese '' , with isolated empty bubbles of true vacuum of various sizes unable to find one another in the background of false vacuum .",
    "old inflation , which has constant ( time - independent ) small @xmath18 , fails . in old inflation",
    ", the universe can easily grow the requisite 60 e - foldings , but reheating never takes place .    in the opposite limit of @xmath38 ( high nucleation efficiency ) ,",
    "the phase transition proceeds very rapidly .",
    "if there were only one scalar field , it would not remain in the false vacuum long enough to give rise to sufficient inflation , though the phase transition would complete , leading to percolation and thermalization .",
    "guth and weinberg @xcite as well as turner , weinberg , and widrow @xcite calculated that a critical value of @xmath39 is required in order for percolation and thermalization to be achieved . in this paper , we consider a chain of multiple tunneling fields rather than a single field .",
    "each of these fields will develop a value of @xmath18 in excess of the critical value required for percolation .",
    "the amount that the universe inflates before the phase transition completes varies inversely to the parameter @xmath18 .",
    "the number of e - foldings due to tunneling of a single scalar field is @xmath40 using the first equality in eq.([eq : lifetime ] ) for the lifetime @xmath41 , we then have @xmath42 sufficient inflation requires the total number of e - foldings to satisfy @xmath43 old inflation can easily achieve this requirement with a single scalar field for a wide variety of parameters . for a double - well potential in the thin wall limit ,",
    "the only relevant quantity in the potential for determining the total amount of inflation is the ratio @xmath44 .",
    "hence old inflation can take place at a variety of energy scales , and can be equally as successful at a tev as at @xmath0gev .",
    "however , using eq.([eq : betacrit ] ) , we see that percolation and thermalization of any single field require @xmath45 for the case of inflation with a single scalar field , @xmath46 and obviously one can not simultaneously satisfy both criteria in eqs.([eq : totreq ] ) and ( [ eq : ncrit ] ) . hence with time - independent @xmath47 and @xmath18 , old inflation fails .",
    "however , as we will illustrate in the next section , both of these criteria can be satisfied with a time - dependent nucleation rate , in which case @xmath18 and @xmath47 change with time .",
    "this transition from small @xmath18 ( large n ) to large @xmath18 ( small n ) can be achieved by a small change in the parameters in the potential .",
    "because of the exponential dependence in eq.([eq : eucact ] ) on the euclidean action , the values of @xmath18 and @xmath47 are extremely sensitive to the parameters in the potential , in this case to the ratio @xmath48 .",
    "because the tunneling rate is so sensitive to this ratio , the transition from a field that would remain for an inordinate amount of time in the false vacuum to a field that tunnels rapidly requires only a small change in the ratio of @xmath48 .",
    "as discussed later , this ratio only needs to change by a few percent to cause a transition from slow to rapid tunneling for a wide range of energy scales from gut to tev .",
    "it is interesting that potentials which have comparable values of @xmath23 and @xmath49 are near the borderline between rapid transitions and no transition .",
    "we will take advantage of this fact in this paper .",
    "such potentials with parameter @xmath50 are quite natural .",
    "adams and freese @xcite solved the problem of old inflation for a single tunneling field by using a time - dependent nucleation rate and hence a time - dependent @xmath18 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the ideal time - dependence of @xmath18 would be a step - function . in that case",
    ", @xmath18 is initially small so that one obtains the required 60 e - foldings of inflation , followed by a sudden transition to a large value of @xmath18 so that all of the universe goes from false to true vacuum at once",
    ". then all the bubbles of true vacuum are roughly of the same size , and they are able to percolate and thermalize ( leaving no swiss cheese ) . adams and freese obtained the appropriate time dependence of @xmath18 by coupling a tunneling inflaton field @xmath51 to a rolling field @xmath52 .",
    "they took the total potential for the two fields to be @xmath53 where the inflaton field @xmath51 is a tunneling field with potential @xmath54 given by the form of eq.([eq : doublewell ] ) , and @xmath52 is a rolling field with potential @xmath55 .",
    "the purpose of the rolling field is to catalyze a change in the tunneling rate of the tunneling inflaton . as interaction",
    ", they considered @xmath56 clearly many other forms of the potential are possible ( e.g. , @xmath57 ) , but the resulting behavior should be qualitatively the same . due to this interaction , ( in the thin wall limit ) bubbles will nucleate at a rate given by eq.([eq : tunrate ] ) , where the effective energy difference between the vacua is given by @xmath58 the tunneling rate is practically zero when the rolling field @xmath52 is at the top of its potential and abruptly becomes very large as @xmath52 approaches the minimum of its potential .",
    "initially , when the value of the rolling field @xmath59 is small , the interaction term @xmath60 is negligible , and the energy difference @xmath61 between the two minima is small enough that the field is stable in the false vacuum .",
    "the parameter @xmath18 is small and the universe inflates .",
    "then , as @xmath52 rolls to the bottom of its potential , the energy difference @xmath62 between the minima of the tunneling field grows and the tunneling rate given by eqs.([eq : tunrate ] ) and ( [ eq : eucact ] ) climbs sharply due to the exponential dependence on the value of @xmath63 . suddenly @xmath18 becomes larger than the critical value for nucleation and true vacuum bubbles of the tunneling field appear everywhere at once .",
    "the universe successfully completes the phase transition .",
    "the strength of this double field model is that it saves old inflation .",
    "the bubble nucleation is sudden and occurs throughout the universe , so that it can percolate and thermalize . in the double field model",
    ", the rolling field must be flat ( just as in new inflation ) in order for the tunneling field to remain in its false vacuum for a sufficiently long time and in order not to overproduce density fluctuations .",
    "to explain this flatness , freese @xcite used a pseudo - nambu goldstone boson ( shift symmetry ) , similar to the model of natural inflation @xcite , but then found that the parameters of the tunneling inflaton potential needed to be fine - tuned as well .",
    "an alternate approach to obtaining a time - dependent @xmath18 was pursued in the models of extended @xcite and hyperextended inflation @xcite , in which the hubble constant becomes time - dependent due to brans - dicke gravity @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown @xcite that most versions of these models are ruled out due to overproduction of big bubbles in conflict with microwave background @xcite and oher data .    in this paper",
    "we preserve some features of the original double field inflation model .",
    "we couple fields together so as to modify the value of @xmath62 in the double well potential and thereby modify the nucleation rate . here , however , no individual tunneling stage is responsible for more than a fraction of an e - folding , and no fine - tuning of potentials is required . in the simplest variant of our model , only tunneling fields are implemented , though some of these may be replaced by rolling fields instead .",
    "the model of chain inflation relies on a chain of tunneling fields .",
    "all the fields start out in their false vacua . the chain is set off by a single field tunneling to its true vacuum ; this tunneling event then catalyzes a chain of tunneling events of the other fields . in the context of a landscape , where there is a multidimensional potential for a large number of scalar fields",
    ", one can think of chain inflation in the following way . at some place in the universe ,",
    "the fields start off in a bowl ( metastable minimum ) of some energy .",
    "then , the tunneling of one field in our chain model is equivalent to moving to a bowl of slightly lower energy . in the chain picture",
    ", each tunneling event provides a small amount of inflation ( less than one e - fold ) but , in the end , by the time the fields reach their collective ground state ( which we take to be @xmath12 ) , more than 60 e - folds have taken place",
    ".    we will begin by discussing an extremely simplified version of the chain .",
    "we will have the fields tunnel to their true vacua one at a time : first one field tunnels ( i.e. bubbles of its true vacuum nucleate ) , then it catalyzes the second field to nucleate , which catalzyes the third field to nucleate etc .",
    "each field couples only to two others : the prior and subsequent ones in the chain .",
    "this over - simplified model is like a set of dominoes : once the first domino falls , all the rest subsequently follow .",
    "after we discuss this extremely simplified model , we will generalize to additional couplings between the fields and a variety of parameters for the potentials and couplings .",
    "our model relies only on one general feature , of tunneling from bowl to bowl , regardless of the detailed form of the potential .",
    "chain inflation will happen for a system of scalar fields in a multidimensional potential , which tunnel from bowl to bowl .",
    "our particular choice of couplings allow simple calculations so as to obtain reasonable estimates .",
    "however , the coupling certainly need not be of the form presented here .",
    "indeed , all the fields could couple to each in other in a complicated fashion as long as the couplings preserve the bowl - type of structure in a multidimensional landscape .    as our toy model , we take all the fields to have double - well potentials",
    ". the basic features of the model generalize to other choices of potential . as a concrete example",
    ", we will start with a particular form of the interaction which is linear in one of the fields and cubic in the other ( simply because it makes the algebra easy ) .",
    "qualitatively , the particular choice of interaction term is not important , and other choices such as interactions which are quadratic in both fields , would produce the same behavior of the chain model .",
    "other choices of potential or changes in the potential could equally well drive a time - dependent nucleation rate that allows inflation as well as percolation . in this paper , we use a time - dependence of the ( effective ) energy difference between minima to drive a time - dependent nucleation rate .",
    "alternatively , one could use a time - changing barrier height or time - dependent potential width to achieve the same time - dependence of the nucleation rate and hence of @xmath18 .",
    "there are many ways to achieve the same effect , and we have chosen a cubic coupling influencing the value of the energy difference as a concrete example .    the total potential for the system is @xmath64\\ ] ] where @xmath65 .",

    "one after the next , in a chain , they tunnel to their true vacua at @xmath69 .",

    ". some of the energy @xmath77 must go into this interaction energy rather than into the energy of the true vacuum bubbles .",

    "_ decreases _ the energy difference between the vacua , and makes tunneling of field @xmath71 to its true vacuum more difficult ( lowers the tunneling rate ) .    however , it is still true that each field in the chain successfully catalyzes the next one to nucleate .",

    "it is only inside these empty bubble interiors ( not in the predominant sea of false vacuum ) that the chain of phase transitions continues .",
    "the interactions between the first field and the subsequent fields only become nonzero inside the bubble interiors of this first field , so that catalysis of further phase transitions in the chain only takes place inside the bubbles of true vacuum . hence",
    ", our observable universe must live inside a large bubble produced by this first trigger field .",
    "reheating of this large bubble is not a problem , as it can easily happen due to the tunneling and percolation of subsequent fields in the chain .",

    ", the first field in the chain can either be a spontaneous tunneler , a rolling field , or a slow tunneler .",

    "thus the universe inflates 0.1 e - folds before the first field tunnels , then another 0.1 e - folds from that time until the second field reaches its true minimum , then another 0.1 e - folds until the third field reaches its true minimum , etc . , with enough stages to obtain a total of at least 60 e - folds .    in order to obtain 0.1 e - folds in the first stage",
    ", the number of e - folds that would be obtained by the first tunneling field ( if the other fields were not present ) is @xmath169 . after each stage ,",
    "the number of fields participating in the inflation decreases by 1 . in the @xmath151th stage ,",
    "the number of e - foldings is thus @xmath170 thus , for the first 1000 stages , @xmath171 . by this time",
    "there are already a total of 100 e - foldings ( adding up over the first 1000 stages ) .",
    "eventually enough fields have tunneled to their minima that the number of e - folds per stage become very small . at the 10,000 stage ,",
    "only @xmath172 e - folds result",
    ". however , the total number of e - folds , summed over all the stages , easily exceeds 60 .",
    "we can now ask how reasonable the parameters would be to obtain the above scenario . to honestly do so would require solving for tunneling in the thick wall limit , as will be considered in a later paper .",
    "typically tunneling is suppressed in the thin wall limit , but we will discuss here a case where it is not for illustrative purposes . to tunnel in a thin wall limit",
    "requires two things .",
    "first , the field should tunnel rather than slow roll ; i.e. the energy difference between vacua should be less than the barrier height @xmath173 . for the asymmetric double",
    "well this requirement becomes @xmath174 second , the thin wall condition must be satisfied .",
    "following coleman @xcite , the thin wall condition for an asymmetric double well is @xmath175 as an example , to satisfy the above conditions , we will take @xmath176    the number of e - folds due to a single tunneling event in the thin wall limit is determined by eq.([eq : nstage ] ) .",
    "it is indeed possible to find values for which one can both tunnel quickly and satisfy the thin wall conditions .",
    "we note that a larger value of @xmath36 allows for a quicker transition and also fixes the minimal value of @xmath48 to satisfy the above conditions .",
    "we will now consider an example to illustrate that even in this unrealistic case , fairly reasonable parameters can be used . for @xmath177 with @xmath178 and for inflation at the gut scale @xmath179gev , we find @xmath180 is required ( for the parameters including the effects of coupling to a prior field ) . similarly , for inflation at the tev scale @xmath181tev , we find @xmath182 is required .",
    "in addition , to go from a slow tunneling regime ( 1000 e - foldings ) to a fast regime ( 0.1 e - foldings ) requires a 2% or a 3% change of @xmath48 for respectively tev and gut scale fields . despite the artificial nature of the thin wall limit , these values are quite sensible .      typically , tunneling is suppressed in the thin wall limit for any theory ( we thank erick weinberg for pointing this out to us ) , though we have discussed above some parameter ranges in which thin wall tunneling does take place . more generally , a more accurate calculation of tunneling rates must be performed numerically , in the the thick wall limit , where the energy difference @xmath23 is no longer much smaller than the barrier height , following the work of adams @xcite .",
    "of course , in the case where @xmath23 is greater than the barrier height , there is no tunneling at all and the field simply rolls down the potential .",
    "then too little inflation would ensue . if one were to allow a distribution of parameters , even one peaked about @xmath183 , then it is plausible that a significant fraction of the fields would remain in their false vacua long enough for the model to work . in particular , as we will see in section 4.2 , if there are different paths taken by neighboring patches of the universe , those regions that inflate more end up much larger than those that inflate little , and our observable universe is more likely to end up within the larger patch .",
    "it is only the extreme case where the rapidly tunneling fields couple to all the intrinsicallly slowly tunneling fields and cause them to tunnel rapidly as well ( or roll ) , that is dangerous .",
    "below we will also consider interactions that act in the direction of slowing down the tunneling , which would assist in this case .",
    "[ these interactions could exist initially and disappear in time .",
    "] however , in general , we do want to warn that there is a range of parameter space for which the potential is not fine - tuned , and yet chain inflation may not work .",
    "for example , if the coupling parameter @xmath184 between the fields were large , then the resulting tunneling could become far too rapid ( or , depending on the details of the coupling could become far too slow ) ; note that we have assumed all couplings are naturally @xmath185 .",
    "there is one basic requirement on a multidimensional potential in order to obtain successful chain inflation : there must be enough long - lived fields , in the sense that they remain in their false vacua for a significant fraction of an e - folding before being catalyzed to tunnel to their vacua . then sufficient inflation will result .",
    "one might ask whether or not the path taken by the system on the way to its ground state would preferentially skip elements in the chain . in a landscape picture , the path could jump directly to a bowl that is lower in energy by several @xmath23 ; this alternate route would be dangerous if it were the quickest path towards the ground state , as fewer e - folds of inflation would result .",
    "we can show that the system does not skip steps for the case where all the potentials have identical parameters ; the more general case will be considered in the next section .",
    "let s consider two fields @xmath186 and @xmath187 , each with a double - well potential of the same parameters ( same @xmath23 and @xmath5 ) .",
    "following the discussion above , in the two - dimensional field space , there are four bowls : ( 1 ) at point a , @xmath188 , ( 2 ) at point b , @xmath189 and @xmath190 , ( 3 ) at point c , @xmath191 and @xmath192 , and ( 4 ) at point d , @xmath193 .",
    "the system starts out at point a , where both fields are in their false vacua .",
    "then , one can ask the question of whether it is faster to proceed from @xmath107 or directly from @xmath194 .",
    "the latter path would be dangerous if it were the fastest , as a path that proceeds quickly to the ground state might not inflate enough . as a reminder , the tunneling rate scales as @xmath195 $ ] where @xmath196 . in comparing the path ( @xmath143 ) vs. ( @xmath194 )",
    ", we see that we need to compare @xmath23 vs. @xmath197 and @xmath5 vs. @xmath198 , so that the relevant comparison is between @xmath199 vs. @xmath200 .",
    "we can now compare the time it takes to follow the two paths : @xmath201 > > 2 \\times { \\rm exp}[f ( a^4/\\epsilon)^3 ] \\propto { \\rm time } ( a \\rightarrow b ) + ( b \\rightarrow d ) .\\ ] ] hence the preferred path is to tunnel in the direction in field space in which the energy decreases by a single unit of @xmath23 at a time ; i.e. , which can be thought of as the tunneling of a single field .",
    "chain inflation is a general phenomenon in which the system of scalar fields in a multidimensional potential tunnel from bowl to bowl .",
    "our particular choice of couplings allow simple calculations so as to obtain reasonable estimates .",
    "however , the coupling certainly need not be of the form presented here . indeed , all the fields could couple to each in other in a complicated fashion as long as the couplings preserve the bowl - type of structure in a multidimensional landscape .",
    "previously we considered the simplest single chain model in which all fields have the same parameters . in this section",
    "we discuss some simple generalizations of this model which would also work .",
    "we restrict our discussion to double - well potentials , but the results should generalize to other choices of potentials .      first , let us consider the effects of keeping the same form of the potential and the interactions , but allowing a variety of parameters @xmath202 and @xmath77 for the different fields .",
    "in addition , we will allow for the existence of a number of chains .",
    "the first field could couple to a number of secondary fields ( next in line in a chain after the first field ) . then each of the secondary fields couples to a number of tertiary fields , etc .",
    "some subset of the secondary fields could also couple to each other .    in one patch of real space ,",
    "the fields follow a single path in ( multidimensional ) field space ; i.e. , at each instant , there is a single vacuum expectation value for each of the fields @xmath203 . of the many choices of direction in field space , e.g. the variety of possible secondary tunneling fields , the system only chooses one . at each stage",
    ", the path en route to the ground state that would be chosen would be the fastest one .",
    "for example , if the first field couples to ten others , then the system chooses the direction in field space with the fastest tunneling rate to a lower energy .",
    "the system `` chooses ''",
    "the field that tunnels the most quickly .",
    "the other nine fields to which the first field couples become irrelevant .    here",
    "we address three issues that could arise for different choices of parameters in the potentials : ( i ) fields which tunnel too slowly , ( ii ) fields which tunnel too rapidly , and ( iii ) interactions which are so large that the chain sequence is modified .    _ tunneling too slowly : _ due to the variety of parameters , there might be some fields which , even after their interactions turn on , still are stuck in their false vacua . in the language of the landscape , even at field values in the multidimensional field space where the interaction of the given field with the preceding member of the chain is nonzero ,",
    "still the tunneling rate of the field is extremely slow . in that case , the path that the system takes en route to the ground state will simply avoid that direction . as long as one of the secondary fields is able to tunnel to a lower minimum , the expectation values of the fields will choose the path that has a seris of rapid tunnelers . in a landscape picture , the system will take the path of least resistance to the ground state .",
    "in addition , generically there are multiple couplings between fields , and it is likely that one of these couplings will suffice to induce the ( otherwise slowly tunneling ) field to quickly tunnel .    even if the path that is chosen does include a very slow tunneler in the middle of the chain , as long as there are sixty e - folds subsequent to that slow tunneler , any resultant negative curvature will get washed out by the subsequent inflation .    _ tunneling too rapidly : _ a new problem could arise , however . somewhere down in the chain ,",
    "e.g. the fiftieth field in the chain , could have parameters ( e.g. a large enough @xmath23 ) such that it tunnels spontaneously , without being catalyzed by any other field . if we think of the single chain as a series of dominos , then this case corresponds to the 50th domino falling over on its own .",
    "if there are 100 dominos in total , then the first set of 50 and the second set of 50 will fall over at the same time .",
    "it will take half as long for all of them to fall over , i.e. , only half as many e - foldings of inflation will result , so the overall vacuum energy will drop down by an amount @xmath23 twice as quickly .",
    "however , sufficient inflation should still result as long as ( i ) there are significantly more than 60 steps in the chains and ( ii ) relatively natural values of parameters for the potentials are chosen , i.e. , @xmath204 for most of the fields , so that most fields do not tunnel spontaneously ( see the discussion in section 4.1.3 ) .    at different spatial points in the universe ,",
    "it is possible that the system chooses different paths in field space .",
    "for example , of the ten possible secondary paths in the above example , it is possible that two of them have the same tunneling rate and are equally likely to be chosen .",
    "then , in the end , two different patches of the universe that followed slightly different paths could end up at different ground states , both with @xmath12 but with different field values .",
    "topological objects such as domain walls could be formed in between these different patches .",
    "of all the possible paths to the ground state , some may be too rapid , in the sense that the total number of e - folds is too small ( e.g. because of the effect discussed in the last paragraph ) .",
    "then clearly we do not live in a patch of the universe that took such a steep , rapid path .",
    "since this under - inflated patch of the universe is much smaller than the patches that did inflate , it is quite reasonable that our observable universe lies within the much larger regions that did inflate sufficiently .",
    "_ too large interactions : _ our treatment in eq.([eq : vtot ] ) has assumed that one can break up the potential into a set of asymmetric double well potentials with interactions .",
    "however , if the interactions are very large , @xmath205 for one of the fields , this basic picture is not quite right . if two subsequent fields in the chain have very different energy scales , then the order in which fields tunnel in the chain may change .",
    "for example , if a field with a tev scale potential is followed in the chain by a field with a gut scale potential , the gut scale potential will override the tev one and will tunnel first .    to illustrate this effect ,",
    "let us consider two of the fields in the system , 1 and 2 , as studied in table i and the accompanying discussion .",
    "now let us take the first field to be characterized by a tev scale , @xmath206 while the second field is characterized by a grand unified ( gut ) scale @xmath207 we will also assume @xmath208 .",
    "the four bowls ( minima ) now have energies @xmath209 the system starts out in bowl a , where both fields are in their false vacua .",
    "ordinarily field @xmath108 would tunnel first and the system would then move to bowl b. here , however , the interaction is so big that the energy difference between bowls a and b is negative , @xmath210 i.e. bowl b is at a _ higher _ energy than bowl a. clearly the fields will not tunnel from a to a state b of higher energy . instead , the second ( larger ) field @xmath112 tunnels first .",
    "the energy difference between bowls a and c is @xmath211 thus the system preferentially takes the path @xmath212 .",
    "the resultant number of e - folds is not significantly different from the number obtained in the normal sequence of the chain as discussed previously .",

    "if all the fields have @xmath213 , then the system may reach the ground state without inflating enough .",
    "if , on the other hand , all the fields have @xmath214 , then one might worry that they all remain in their false vacua too long , although their couplings to other fields in that case will probably induce them to tunnel and percolate .",
    "[ if there is some discrete symmetry that forces @xmath215 , so that both minima in the double - well potential are degenerate , obviously there is no tunneling at all . ]",
    "we have considered a very simple form of the interaction , @xmath216 , where @xmath217 are the field values at the minima . more generally , the interaction could be of the form @xmath218 where @xmath219 is an arbitrary field value and @xmath220 is an arbitrary power .",
    "the fact that the value of @xmath219 does not necessarily equal the value of @xmath5 does not qualitatively change the model .",
    "the amount by which @xmath62 differs from @xmath23 due to the interaction has to be recalculated , but the effect of causing a transition from slow to rapid tunneling still takes place ( one must of course check that the interaction is strong enough to change @xmath23 by 1% .    due to the possibility of the opposite sign in front of @xmath219 , the interaction could have the opposite effect from what we want .",
    "it could inhibit the field from tunneling , rather than catalyze the tunneling .",
    "one could imagine that half of the interactions felt by a given field would serve to increase the tunneling rate , and half to decrease it . as different trigger fields tunneled to their minima , they could act in either direction",
    ". however , the symmetry is broken by the fact that the field only has to be induced to tunnel once .",
    "once it has tunneled , then the sign of future interactions is irrelevant .",
    "also , the system will take the path of least resistance , i.e. , the path along which the interaction serves to speed up rather than slow down the tunneling .",
    "one could also imagine an interaction which is nonzero only when catalyzing field is still in its false vacuum ; for example , the catalyzing field could prevent tunneling of another field early on ( due to the interaction ) and then play no further role once it reaches its minimum .",
    "one could imagine that , depending on the values of the parameters , as one of the fields in a stage of chain inflation successfully reheats , it thermally activates one of the other fields to go over the top of its barrier .",
    "heretofore we have not considered the effects of such thermal activation , which might be interesting to pursue .      in the paper",
    "we have restricted the discussion to a series of tunneling fields .",
    "however , there is no reason to do so . in the landscape",
    ", one could imagine a mixed succession of rolling fields and tunneling fields .",
    "the path chosen towards the ground state could involve rolling for a while , followed by a tunneling event , followed again by a period of rolling down a potential .",
    "such a mixed chain would be interesting to study further .",
    "here we briefly comment on three variants of tunneling inflation with multiple fields which are alternatives to the chain we have been discussing : ( i ) a large number of uncoupled tunneling fields which tunnel simultaneously , ( ii ) two - tunnelers , and ( iii ) the case where the first tunneling field in the chain inflates sixty e - folds and then catalyzes a large number of fields to simultaneously tunnel and percolate .",
    "we will see that all these ideas are fatally flawed if one restricts the discussion to multiple tunneling fields only .",
    "however , we emphasize that the third idea may succeed if the trigger field is a rolling field ( as in the case of the double field model ) which , once it reaches its minimum , catalyzes the simultaneous tunneling of a large number of secondary fields . this idea will be discussed in future work .",
    "here we consider a large number @xmath11 of uncoupled tunneling fields , analagous to the large number of uncoupled rolling fields in assisted inflation@xcite .",
    "the number of e - folds obtained from any one of the fields is given using eq.([eq : ni ] ) as , @xmath221 if each field produces a small amount of inflation @xmath222 , the total number of e - folds from all the fields together is @xmath223 ( see eq.([eq : q2 ] ) ) .",
    "one can easily imagine obtaining sufficient inflation , @xmath224 .",
    "however , then the parameter @xmath225 is a constant value independent of time , and never reaches @xmath226 required for perocolation and thermalization .",
    "this model is equivalent to inflating with a single field of energy density @xmath227 with constant nucleation rate .",
    "hence the required criteria of sufficient inflation ( small @xmath18 ) followed by reheating ( large @xmath18 ) can never be achieved for constant @xmath18 . in short",
    "this model fails for the same reason old inflation does .",
    "thus , although the model of assisted inflation , with multiple uncoupled rolling fields , can succeed , the equivalent model with multiple uncoupled tunneling fields fails .",
    "one might propose an alternative to the double field model , in which there are two tunneling fields instead of one roller and one tunneler . here",
    "the first tunneling field serves as the trigger field to catalyze the tunneling of the second field . at first , both fields are in their false vacua .",
    "then , when the first field tunnels to its true minimum , it catalyzes the second field to tunnel as well . in the discussion of the double field model above , in eq.([eq : vint ] ) one could simply replace @xmath228 with @xmath229 , where @xmath108 is the trigger field , whose potential has a false vacuum at @xmath24 and a true vacuum at @xmath230 .",
    "hence the interaction term only turns on once the trigger field has tunneled to its true vacuum . at that point",
    ", the energy difference between minima in eq.([eq : epsiloneff ] ) of the second field becomes so large that its tunneling rate becomes very large , allowing bubbles of its true vacuum to nucleate simulataneously throughout .    in this two tunneler model",
    ", the trigger field must remain in its false vacuum for at least sixty e - folds , because once it tunnels to its true vacuum , inflation is over .",
    "hence , this trigger field must have @xmath231 .",
    "it does _ not _ percolate and thermalize .",
    "instead , there are isolated swiss cheese bubbles of this first field , i.e. , empty bubbles of true vacuum of the trigger field . since the interaction term only becomes nonzero for the bubble interiors from the trigger field , the secondary field only undergoes the phase transition inside these trigger field bubbles .",
    "all the bubbles from secondary field must live inside a large bubble produced by this first trigger field .",
    "the idea would be to reheat the interior of one of the bubbles of the trigger fields with the energy density from the bubble collisions of the secondary tunneler . since the secondary tunneler does have a time - dependent nucleation rate , due to interaction with the trigger field , the bubbles from the second tunneler can easily percolate and thermalize .",
    "if @xmath23 is large enough for this second tunneler , there is no problem reheating the inside of the big bubble from the first tunneler .",
    "however , in the case where the trigger field is a tunneling field , the universe we live in today can not have originated inside the interior of a true vacuum bubble of the first tunneler .",
    "the interior of the bubble is an infinite open universe with negative curvature as in eq.([eq : negcurv ] ) .",
    "another sixty e - folds of inflation , subsequent to the production of this trigger field bubble , are required in order to inflate away this negative curvature .",
    "but in the model where the secondary field tunnels right away once the trigger field bubble comes into existence , these 60 e - folds do not take place .",
    "hence the two - tunneler model fails .",
    "here we consider inflation with multiple fields which are all coupled together in such a way that , once the first one reaches its true minimum , it catalyzes all the rest to tunnel immediately .",
    "this model is similar to the two - tunneler model discussed above , but with the single secondary field replaced by multiple secondary fields which all tunnel at once .",
    "we will see that this model suffers from the same problems as the two - tunneler model above .    in order for this model to work",
    ", the first field must remain in its false vacuum for sixty e - folds ; once it tunnels , all the other secondary fields simultaneously and very quickly tunnel , thereby ending the inflation .",
    "one could imagine , e.g. , that the potential for each of the fields is a double well as in eq.([eq : doublewell ] ) , with interaction terms of the form @xmath232 here @xmath108 is the trigger field . as in the double - field model of adams and freese , once the trigger field reaches its minimum , @xmath233 and all the fields tunnel at once and successfully reheat .",
    "here , @xmath234 .",
    "once the trigger field reaches its minimum at @xmath235 , @xmath236 . due to the abrupt change in tunneling rate for all the secondary fields from very slow to very fast , these fields can easily nucleate bubbles of true vacuum throughout the universe and hence percolate and thermalize .    however , as in the two - tunneler model , the interiors of bubbles from the initial trigger field are problematic .",
    "the trigger field must remain in its false vacuum for at least sixty e - folds , because once it tunnels to its true vacuum all the other fields tunnel as well , and inflation is over .",
    "hence , this trigger field must have @xmath17 , it does not percolate , and empty bubbles result from this first tunneling . the interaction term in eq.([eq : simmultunn ] ) is only nonzero inside these empty bubbles , so that the secondary fields only tunnel to their true vacua inside the trigger bubbles .",
    "again , although the interior of the big bubble can successfully reheat due to the percolation and thermalization of the secondary bubbles , the interior does not look like our universe .",
    "it is an infinite open universe with negative curvature .",
    "another sixty e - folds of inflation , subsequent to the production of this trigger field bubble , are required in order to inflate away this negative curvature .",
    "but in the model where all the secondary fields tunnel right away once the trigger field bubble comes into existence , these 60 e - folds do not take place .",
    "hence , one must return to the chain picture that we have discussed as the primary model of this paper , in which the first field triggers a chain of tunnelers that approach their minima serially and in the process give rise to another 60 e - folds of inflation .",
    "we note a variant of this idea that avoids the problems discussed above .",
    "the trigger field may be a rolling field .",
    "the key difference is that the first field is rolling , as in the case of the double field model .",
    "once this rolling field reaches its minimum , it catalyzes the simultaneous tunneling of a large number of secondary fields . if one uses a rolling field as the initial trigger field , then there is no issue of negative curvature .",
    "however , one must address the issue of parameters of the rolling field to demonstrate that one can avoid fine - tuning .",
    "this subject is the topic of an upcoming paper .",
    "here we address the question of whether or not de sitter violations of energy conservation could render the barrier between false and true vacuum in the double wells irrelevant , in that the energy violations are so large that they send the field over the top of the barrier .",
    "we show that the effect is not important in our model .",
    "since the de sitter metric has no timelike killing vector globally defined , there are violations of energy conservation of magnitude @xmath237 where @xmath238 is the vacuum energy density . for us , @xmath238 is the largest at the beginning of inflation , @xmath239 where @xmath11 is the number of fields .",
    "if @xmath240 , then the field can hop over the top of the barrier . for this to happen , one would need @xmath241 .",
    "if we take the mass scale of the barrier energy to be gut scale , this corresponds to @xmath242 .",
    "then the condition for the field to be able to hop is never satisfied for @xmath243 . at potentials with lower energy scales ,",
    "it is even more difficult for energy violation to cause the field to hop over the barrier , and an even larger number of fields would be required .",
    "thus we conclude that , in the models we have been considering , the field does nt go over the top of the barrier due to energy non - conservation .      whereas slowly rolling models of inflation require unnaturally small parameters , the proposed model of chain inflation has the attractive feature that the potential need not be fine - tuned .    in inflationary models with a single scalar field that is slowly rolling",
    ", the potential is characterized by its height height @xmath244 ( the vacuum energy of the inflaton ) and width @xmath245 ( the change in field value during inflation ) . for inflation to work in this context",
    ", it must satisfy certain constraints : there must be sufficient inflation and the amplitude of the density perturbations @xcite can not exceed @xmath246 .",
    "a fine - tuning parameter , @xmath247 has been introduced to examine these constraints @xcite .",
    "the most natural value of this ratio in particle physics would be @xmath248 . instead , in order to satisfy the above two constraints",
    ", it has been shown that this parameter must satisfy @xcite @xmath249 a very unnatural value .",
    "this strongly constrains models of slow roll inflation .",
    "very few inflation models ( such as natural inflation @xcite ) can explain this small number .",
    "the potentials in chain inflation do not require fine - tuning .",
    "the potentials we have considered have @xmath250 , i.e. , the parameter @xmath251 .",
    "this is an advantage of the chain inflation model .",
    "as discussed in section 4.1.3 , however , the multidimensional potential in chain inflation must have the right parameters to allow the fields to remain in their false vacua for a long enough time to obtain at least sixty e - folds in all .",
    "there are several remaining issues for future work .",
    "the most important is the question of generation of density fluctuations .",
    "one source of perturbations would be the fact that the lifetime of a field in its false vacuum is given only roughly by eq.([eq : lifetime ] ) .",
    "in fact , there would be a distribution of timescales about this typical value .",
    "some regions of the universe would tunnel to their true minima on a slighter shorter timescale than their neighbors . in different patches of the universe ,",
    "the phase transition could be a little ahead or a little behind , and this timing difference can lead to density fluctuations .",
    "this situation is similar to the density fluctuations in slow - roll inflation that are produced as a result of neighboring regions rolling to their minima at slightly different times ( due to quantum fluctuations at the beginning of rolling ) . as in new inflation , here again the fluctuations that are created sixty to fifty e - folds before the end of inflation are on length scales that today correspond to observable structure .",
    "it is not clear what the spectrum of these perturbations would be , or whether they would be adiabatic or isocurvature .",
    "this issue must be investigated further .    in those regions which tunneled the most quickly , the resulting bubbles would have more time to grow than in the neighboring regions . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors worried about the `` big bubble '' problem that resulted in inflation with a single field ; the universe could not have tolerated the excessively big bubbles that would arise . here , however , the size difference between bubbles of any one field is given by @xmath252 , and @xmath148 is a small number ( less than 1/3 ) .",
    "thus the largest bubbles can not even be twice as large as the typical bubbles , and would not create unduly large inhomogeneities .",
    "they would instead potentially create the density fluctuations that we see .",
    "it takes an extra amount of time , @xmath253 $ ] , for energy in the bubble walls to convert to particles .",
    "one finds this amount of extra energy near the bubble walls .",
    "one can ask whether this extra energy can be smoothed out across the bubbles . the particles ( at this point relativistic ) move across the bubbles with the speed of light .",
    "hence in a minkowski background , the particles could easily thermalize across the interior . however , here the background spacetime is still de sitter after one of the fields has tunneled to its minimum while some of the other fields have not , and the system is not yet at its ground state .",
    "hence the interior space is expanding superluminally and the particles can not traverse the interior .",
    "one ends up with spherical shells of particles .",
    "of course , as the universe continues to inflate , the densities of these particles is diluted to the point where they are irrelevant . in short , percolating bubbles in the early stages of inflation turn into spherical shells of particles ( where the bubble wall was ) that can not thermalize , because the interior is de sitter and information can only traverse the bubble at the speed of light . however , the situation is different at the very final stage of inflation , when the last field in the chain tunnels down to @xmath12 .",
    "the bubbles of this last stage of inflation can thermalize so that reheating is successful .",
    "as the system has now tunneled down to minkowski space , the bubble interiors are not expanding superluminally .",
    "the particles produced near the bubble walls can easily traverse the entire bubble in one hubble time and reheat the interior .",
    "in addition , the spherical shells of bubbles produced at earlier inflationary stages can now also spread out throughout the universe , again in a hubble time .    to reiterate , the key question as regards density fluctuations is the timing of the phase transitions in different patches of the universe , as discussed above and as should be investigated further .",
    "density perturbations could result from other effects as well .",
    "for example , perturbations to the exact @xmath254 symmetry of the solution to the euclidean action might lead to deviations in the density .",
    "other effects leading to perturbations ( in rolling models ) were discussed in @xcite and @xcite .      a more accurate treatment of the chain double well model discussed in this paper would require going beyond the thin wall limit .",
    "we are aware that the thin - wall approximation is valid only in the case where @xmath255 , in which case the bounce action is really small and there is no tunneling at all .",
    "hence in those cases of interest where tunneling takes place , one should numerically solve the bounce equation .",
    "however , the basic picture presented in the current paper would remain unchanged , though the detailed numerical answers might be different .",
    "adams @xcite has previously studied generic quartic potentials in the thick wall limit . the chain model as presented still results ( as long as @xmath256 so that the field is tunneling rather than rolling )",
    "in conclusion , we have proposed the model of chain inflation , in which a sequential chain of coupled scalar fields can drive inflation . we considered a toy model of a chain of tunneling fields , each of which catalyzes the next to tunnel to its true vacuum . since each tunneling stage provides only a fraction of an e - folding , percolation of the true vacuum bubbles and hence reheating is easily achieved .",
    "many fields , at least several hundred , are required in order to achieve enough inflation .",
    "such a large number of fields is motivated by the many vacua in the stringy landscape , but our model can apply to a chain of tunnelers in any multidimensional potential .",
    "one can think of each tunneling event as equivalent to dropping from one bowl in a multidimensional potential to another bowl of lower energy , until the zero energy ground state is achieved .",
    "chain inflation has the attractive feature that it relies on couplings between the fields , which are likely to exist .",
    "we have focused on double - well potentials as a toy model , first with identical parameters and couplings , and then generalized to arbitrary values . however , the idea is quite general , and relies only on the idea of tunneling in a multidimensional potential from one minimum to the next , regardless of any details of the potential .",
    "chain inflation works for natural values of parameters and couplings",
    ". it can be successful for a wide variety of energy scales for the potential , ranging from values as low as 10 mev up to a gut scale at @xmath0 gev .",
    "we would like to thank fred adams , alan guth , jose blanco - pillado , will kinney , gary shiu , dejan stojkovic , and erick weinberg for many useful discussions .",
    "we are particularly grateful to jim liu for his invaluable contribution during many helpful conversations about the model .",
