    "populations of coupled rhythmic elements can exhibit macroscopic oscillations through mutual synchronization  @xcite .",
    "the phase oscillator models have played important roles in theoretically analyzing their behavior , and the special class of models given by globally coupled phase oscillators in particular , was studied most intensively in the past  @xcite .",
    "theoretical predictions based on such models have also been experimentally validated , e.g. , in electrochemical oscillator systems  @xcite and in discrete chemical oscillator populations  @xcite .",
    "recently , macroscopic synchronization between interacting groups of globally coupled phase oscillators exhibiting collective oscillations has attracted attention  @xcite . in most of the works",
    "so far , the macroscopic properties such as mutual entrainment between the groups have been analyzed through the microscopic individual phases . however , because we are interested in the macroscopic behavior of the collective rhythms exhibited by the oscillator groups , it should be much more convenient if each group of oscillators can be treated as a single macroscopic oscillator .",
    "based on such consideration , we have developed collective phase reduction methods  @xcite , which provide us with the collective phase sensitivity of macroscopic rhythms of the oscillator group to weak perturbations .    in this paper , we employ the notion of collective phase description  @xcite , and formulate a theory for weakly interacting groups of globally coupled noisy identical phase oscillators in a closed form at the macroscopic level .",
    "specifically , we derive coupled collective phase equations from microscopic langevin phase equations describing weakly interacting groups of globally coupled phase oscillators",
    ". a general formula that gives collective phase coupling functions from the microscopic phase coupling functions between the individual oscillators is obtained , and for the case with sinusoidal coupling , the types of the collective phase coupling function are determined as a function of the coupling parameters .",
    "near the onset of collective oscillations , we can even analytically obtain the collective phase coupling function by the center - manifold and phase reductions .",
    "based on the collective phase equations , we illustrate counter - intuitive phenomena in which two oscillator groups become anti - phase synchronized in spite of in - phase microscopic coupling between the groups , and vice versa ( in - phase synchronization despite anti - phase microscopic coupling ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we considered a similar problem , namely , collective phase synchronization between two groups of globally coupled oscillators .",
    "the crucial difference is that we treat noisy identical phase oscillators in the present work , whereas we analyzed noiseless non - identical phase oscillators in ref .",
    "although these two situations look similar , they are essentially different physical systems ( i.e. , stochastic vs. deterministic ) and mathematical treatments should be developed independently .",
    "here we apply center - manifold reduction as well as phase reduction to nonlinear fokker - planck equations governing the oscillator groups , whereas we used the ott - antonsen ansatz in the analysis of the noiseless non - identical system  @xcite . in both cases , despite the large difference in their mathematical structures , we obtain similar coupled collective phase equations describing macroscopic dynamics of the groups .",
