    "surface morphology during epitaxial growth depends on processes taking place on the substrate .",
    "@xcite at very low temperatures as in the case of molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) , deposited atoms are adsorbed and migrate on the substrate surface until they form nuclei or are incorporated into islands , but they never evaporate back to the ambient vapor .",
    "when an adsorbed atom ( adatom , for short ) sticks and freezes irreversibly to an island , the resulting aggregate takes an irregular dendritic form , @xcite called diffusion - limited aggregate ( dla).@xcite it has a characteristic feature of self - similarity , and is regarded as a typical example of a fractal . in actual experiments , one does not always observe fractal but also compact islands.@xcite compact islands are possible if they can dissociate @xcite or if atoms at the edge of them can diffuse along the periphery . @xcite",
    "since at low temperatures it is difficult for an edge atom to detach , the edge diffusion mainly governs the island morphology .",
    "@xcite during the edge diffusion , however , the outer corner provides an additional barrier to be surpassed .",
    "there , an edge atom has to pass an intermediate state where the number of neighboring bonds is less than that on the straight step edge .",
    "the edge and the corner diffusion is known to influence island morphology . @xcite without edge and corner diffusion , islands are similar to dla . with the edge diffusion they take cross shapes , with the corner diffusion in addition",
    "they become square . at the coalescence ,",
    "these peripheral diffusion governs the shape relaxation .",
    "@xcite furthermore , the corner diffusion barrier is found to induce mound formation for multilayer deposition .",
    "@xcite    diffusion processes are also known to influence the number density @xmath5 of islands nucleated on a singular surface .",
    "@xcite when the deposition rate @xmath6 is large , the adatom density is high and the nucleation occurs frequently .",
    "thus the island density @xmath5 is expected to be high .",
    "when an isolated adatom migrates on the surface with a large surface diffusion constant @xmath3 , the deposited atom moves around a long distance , until it finds nucleation partners or preexisting islands and sticks to them .",
    "thus , as the diffusion rate @xmath3 increases , the rate of forming new nuclei decreases , and the island density @xmath5 on a singular surface diminishes .",
    "more quantitatively , the island density @xmath5 is defined as the total number density of immobile and undissociable clusters with sizes larger than the critical cluster size @xmath9 . in the classical mean - field",
    "nucleation theory , the number density of adatom clusters of size @xmath10 is analyzed by means of rate equations .",
    "@xcite when clusters smaller than @xmath9 can dissociate but only the mononer adatom is mobile with the diffusion constant @xmath3 , @xmath5 is found to follow the scaling law @xcite @xmath11 if the clusters with sizes @xmath10 smaller than the critical size @xmath9 can not dissociate but are mobile as a whole with their respective diffusion constant @xmath12 , the scaling form is approximately given as @xcite @xmath13    by assuming that islands are point sinks to diffusing adatoms and the critical nuclear size is @xmath14 , the island density scaling @xmath7 is confirmed by the kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) simulation .",
    "@xcite actually , islands increase their size during growth , and the scaling relation between the density and the diffusion constant might depend on the island morphology .",
    "there are already many studies on the island density by means of kmc simulation when clustes can dissociate .",
    "@xcite there are also kmc simulations with mobile clusters .",
    "@xcite we study here the effect of edge and corner diffusion processes on the island density and its relation to the island morphology , systematically .    in @xmath15 2 ,",
    "we explain our simulation scheme . in @xmath15 3 , the effect of peripheral diffusion on the island morphology",
    "is studied . on varying the ratio between the surface , edge and corner diffusion",
    ", morphology varies as fractal , needle , and square shapes , as previously observed .",
    "@xcite we point out the different roles of the edge and corner diffusions on the island symmetry .",
    "the island density is discussed in @xmath15 4 . as long as the corner diffusion is small ,",
    "the density scaling is found to be almost independent of the island morphology with an exponent 1/3 , in consistent to the more systematic study by brune et al .",
    "@xcite with a large corner diffusion constant , on the other hand , the scaling form of the island density changes drastically , because small clusters of sizes less than 3 can migrate on the surface , i.e. @xmath16 . the density is well fitted to the scaling @xmath17 .",
    "the increase of the critical island size @xmath9 is also reflected in the island size distribution .",
    "@xcite the result is summarized in a scaling plot of the island density , and discussed in the last @xmath15 5 .",
    "even though the scaling of the island density to the deposition flux agrees to the rate equation analysis , the dependence on the diffusion constants fails to follow the expectation ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "our main aim is to explore the systematics and the universal features of the morphology change of islands on a singular surface as the diffusion mechanism changes , rather than the precise reproduction of some specific experimental observations . for this purpose",
    ", we adopt the simplest model such that atoms are depositing on a ( 100 ) surface of a simple cubic lattice with a solid - on - solid ( sos ) restriction .",
    "the sos restriction is valid at low temperatures , common to mbe .",
    "atoms are deposited randomly onto the substrate with a deposition rate of @xmath6 monolayers per unit time . here",
    "we choose the unit of time such that @xmath18 .",
    "the temperature is assumed to be so low that all deposited atoms stick to the surface and never evaporate back into the ambient gas .",
    "an isolated adatom hops to one of its four nearest neighboring sites at a rate @xmath19 ; the waiting time of an adatom before the jump is @xmath20 , and the surface diffusion constant is given by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the lattice constant .",
    "as for the interlayer diffusion , which takes place in case a deposited atom lands on another adatom , no additional energy barrier is assumed for it to diffuse down . on the contrary ,",
    "atoms at the edge are not allowed to hop up a layer .",
    "therefore , ehrlich - schwoebel mound formation is supressed , and the layer - by - layer growth is expected .",
    "when an atom touches to other adatoms or islands , it makes a nearest neighbor bond to form a cluster . at very low temperatures",
    ", this cluster will never dissociate again .",
    "we assume that adatoms attach clusters irreversibly , and no cluster dissociation takes place .",
    "this means that dimers are stable , and the critical island size is expected to be @xmath14 .",
    "nevertherless , if an edge atom is singly - bonded in the layer , i.e. if it makes only one bond with another adatom , it is possible to diffuse along the island periphery at moderate temperatures .",
    "there are two possible diffusion jumps for a singly - bonded atom ; an edge diffusion along the straight step edge , and a corner diffusion or corner crossing round the outer corner .",
    "the rate of edge diffusion is @xmath23 and that of corner is @xmath24 , as is depicted in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "then , a singly - bonded atom can be classified by its possible motions in two directions .",
    "it is classified as ( a ) an @xmath25 atom on a straight step if both movements are along the step edge , ( b ) an @xmath26 atom at the ridge of a corner if one is the edge diffusion and the other is the corner , and ( c ) a @xmath27 atom on a tip if both movements are across the corner , as shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the edge diffusion constant along the straight step edge is @xmath28 , and we may define the corner diffusion constant as @xmath29 .",
    "precise values of diffusion constants depend on the energy barriers and the temperature . for edge and corner diffusion there may exist extra energy barriers in addition to that for the surface diffusion , and diffusion constants",
    "are probably ordered as @xmath30 .",
    "if an edge atom is incoorporated into the kink site with more than two nearest neighbors , it is assumed to cease migration , for simplicity .",
    "is the rate of edge diffusion and @xmath24 is that of corner diffusion . ]",
    "simulation starts from a clean substrate surface of a size @xmath31 without adatoms .",
    "hereafter we take the lattice constant @xmath32 . therefore , the jump rates @xmath33 s and diffusion constants @xmath34 s are the same . during the simulation , at some stage ,",
    "there are @xmath35 isolated adatoms , @xmath36 edge atoms attached to a straight step edge , @xmath37 atoms at the corner , and @xmath38 atoms at the tip position ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) on the surface .",
    "these adatoms are sorted out in corresponding lists . the transition probability from this configuration to the next one",
    "is given as follows .",
    "the rate of the deposition is @xmath39 , of the surface diffusion @xmath40 , of the edge diffusion @xmath41 and of the corner diffusion @xmath42 .",
    "the total probability of a state change in a unit of time is @xmath43 .",
    "thus , within a time interval @xmath44 , one of the events takes place ; the deposition with a probability @xmath45 , the surface diffusion with @xmath46 , the edge diffusion with @xmath47 and the corner diffusion with @xmath48 . for each diffusion process",
    ", the atom to be moved is picked up randomly from the list .",
    "after each state change , adatom lists have to be adjusted , for example , by eliminating those adatoms with more than two neighboring bonds from the lists , or add an adatom that happens to have a single bond to the corresponding list . the time is increased by @xmath49 . since the time unit is chosen such that the deposition flux @xmath18 , the monolayer is covered at a time @xmath50 , in principle .",
    "because of the stochastic feature of the simulation algorithm , in practice , the actual time for the completion of a monolayer fluctuates around @xmath51",

    "we define the probability @xmath121 as the number of islands with sizes between @xmath122 and @xmath123 devided by the total number of islands @xmath124 with @xmath125 . for each @xmath2",
    ", size distribution of 10 samples are averaged .",
    "it is normalized as @xmath126 , and corresponds to the scaled number density as @xmath127 at a coverage @xmath128 .",
    "@xcite at low @xmath2 s as @xmath69 and @xmath129 in fig.[fig6](a ) , island sizes are widely spread with a broad peak such that there are very large islands with sizes about 2.5 times the average size . this is the typical size distribution for @xmath14 .",
    "@xcite on the contrary , at high @xmath2 s the island size distribution has a narrow peak around the average size , and extends less than twice the average size in the region of large sizes .",
    "this is the typical size distribution for @xmath130 .",
    "@xcite when the clusters smaller then @xmath9 are dissociable , the island size distribution is proposed@xcite to have the form @xmath131 with @xmath132}{\\gamma[(i^*+1 ) a_{i^ * } ] } = ( i^ * a_{i^*})^{a_{i^ * } } , \\quad \\mbox{and } \\quad   c_{i^ * } = \\frac{(i^ * a_{i^*})^{(i^*+1)a_{i^*}}}{a_{i^*}\\gamma[(i^*+1 ) a_{i^ * } ] } , \\ ] ] where @xmath133 means the gamma function .",
    "the probabilities corresponding for @xmath14 and @xmath110 are drawn in fig.[fig6](a ) and ( b ) by continuous curves , respectively , and fit quite well with the simulation data , even though the dissociation is not allowed there .",
    "in fact , the similar size distributions with mobile clusters are obtained in the previous monte carlo simulation .",
    "@xcite there , however , no peripheral diffusion is granted , and the grown islands had fractal structures , in constrast to our square shaped clusters .",
    "we have seen that a large corner diffusion influences the island number density and the size distribution drastically . without or weak corner diffusion ,",
    "the island density varies in proportion to @xmath134 with an exponent @xmath1351/3 , irrespective of the island morphology .",
    "this means that the nuclei are formed at the initial stage of deposition , as soon as the two adatoms collide with each other .",
    "they are immobile and act as a center of nucleation .",
    "therefore , the randomness of the two - adatom encounter is frozen in .",
    "after sufficient density of nuclei is formed , further deposited adatoms are incorporated into the preexisting clusters .",
    "they develope into various shapes , depending on the edge and corner diffusion constants .",
    "since the nucleation takes place at random , the island sizes are distributed rather broad , reflecting the randomness in the island separation . in any case",
    ", this senario permits the island density to be independent of the morphology : the island density is determined long before the island shape appears .    with a large corner diffusion ,",
    "on the other hand , inspections of the time evolution reveal that clusters of small sizes @xmath136 become mobile . since atoms in a cluster smaller than the critical size @xmath110 can move around each other via the corner diffusion ,",
    "small clusters migrate around randomly on the substrate surface . during this cluster diffusion ,",
    "they coagulate with isolated atoms and as a result the island density decreases .",
    "of course , islands larger than the size @xmath1373 can migrate in some configurations , but when compact islands with doubly or more bonded atoms are formed , they cease migration on the substrate surface , and start to act as a nucleation center . during the further stage of cluster growth , the adsorbed atoms form small mobile clusters and are incorporated into islands in group .",
    "this situation is treated by villain et al .",
    "@xcite in terms of the rate equation , and the island density @xmath5 is expected to follow the scaling relation eq.([eq2 ] ) .",
    "since the trimer can migrate on the surface , @xmath110 , @xmath138 is expected .",
    "this is the reason why we fitted the density with a scaling exponent @xmath86 in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "this explains the @xmath6-dependence of @xmath5 , but as for the dependence on diffusion constants , we have to know @xmath139 and @xmath140 in terms of the present edge and corner diffusion constants , @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "there is an exact calculation by sanchez et al .",
    "@xcite of diffusion constants of small clusters mediated by a peripheral diffusion .",
    "the result is simple for a dimer and a trimer on a square lattice as @xmath141 for a dimer to diffuse , one of the adatoms which compose dimer has to cross round the corner . for a trimer , for example , in an extended form to move",
    "an edge atom has to cross the corner and to slide on the edge to another corner . without edge diffusion ,",
    "the center of mass of a trimer can not move . in the case shown in fig.[fig3 ] , @xmath93 and thus @xmath142 . inserting these exact results into the expression ( [ eq2 ] )",
    "obtained by rate equation , the island number density is expected to follow the relation @xmath143 if this scaling holds , the coefficient @xmath112 in eq.([eq3 ] ) should be proportional to @xmath144 , instead the exponent -0.195 found in fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "therefore , the dependence of @xmath5 on cluster diffusion constant does not seem to be properly given by the rate equation .    to check the scaling behavior of the island density with the crossover from the monomer- to the trimer - limited form ,",
    "let us study the scaled island density @xmath145 .",
    "it should be constant around 0.23 for small edge and corner diffusion constnat @xmath93 . for large @xmath93",
    ", it should be proportional to @xmath146 , according to the result of the rate equation analysis ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we try the plot @xmath147 versus @xmath148 , but the data does not collapse on a single universal curve .     as a function of the scaled corner diffusion constant @xmath149 .",
    "the dashed curve represents small @xmath122 asymptotic , @xmath150 , and the continuous line the large @xmath122 asymptotic form @xmath151 . ]    from our simulation result , the island density behaves as @xmath152 with an @xmath2-dependent coefficient @xmath153 for large @xmath2 , as depicted in fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "since the exponent 0.195 is approximately equal to 4/21 , the density is expected to be scaled by the variable @xmath154 at a large @xmath2 more properly .",
    "the scaling plot is shown in fig.[fig7 ] for a wide range of combinations of diffusion constants as @xmath155 and @xmath156 , and one observes a nice data collapse on a universal curve .",
    "it is fitted as @xmath157 as shown in fig.[fig7 ] .",
    "the effect of the edge and corner diffusion during the homoepitaxial nucleation growth on a singular surface is now summarized as follows . as for the island morphology",
    ", these peripheral diffusion makes the island regular and compact . with only the surface diffusion ,",
    "the irreversibly nucleated islands have a fractal shape characteristic to dla . with the edge diffusion ,",
    "islands become thick and compact .",
    "the corner diffusion affects the shape anisotropy .",
    "one may typically say that without the corner diffusion dendritic needle pointing in the @xmath70 direction appear , whereas with it squares with \\{10 } faces appear .",
    "the density of islands is mainly determined before the shape appears . without or with a weak corner diffusion ,",
    "the critical island size is @xmath14 , and the density @xmath5 is related to the surface diffusion constant @xmath3 normalized by the deposition rate @xmath6 as @xmath158 , irrespective of island morphology . with a large corner diffusion constant , on the other hand",
    ", small clusters @xmath159 can migrate randomly on the substrate surface , and another scaling relation @xmath160 is found appropriate .",
    "the flux @xmath6-dependence agrees with the rate equation theory with @xmath110 , but the dependence on diffusion constants @xmath2 contradicts the theory .",
    "the reason of this discrepancy is not clear .",
    "but , since the rate equation is a mean - field type approximation which neglects spatial correlation , it may be fortuitous that @xmath6 dependence agrees in the simulation and the rate equation theory .",
    "recently , the mobility of large clusters is proposed to be very effective in selecting the island size and in arranging islands in order in heteroepitaxial growth.@xcite our model allows the motion of only small clusters less than the size @xmath110 by the corner diffusion , and some size selection is observed . due to the absence of any direct interaction between islands , however , the ordering in island positions can not be achieved . our model",
    "neither contains the size - limiting effect , and the coarsening takes place as the corner diffusion increases .",
