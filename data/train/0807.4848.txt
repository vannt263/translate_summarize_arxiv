    "the appropriateness of such definitions of sheaf is emphasized by the fact that every grothendieck topos is , up to equivalence , the category of sheaves on an involutive quantaloid of `` binary relations '' that is obtained directly from the topos or from a site @xcite .",

    "however , in many ways this is only a mild generalization .",
    "a much broader one is given by sites , where suitable families of morphisms generalize the role of open covers .",
    "a grothendieck topos is by definition the category ( up to equivalence ) of sheaves on a site @xcite . whereas locales are determined up to isomorphism by their toposes of sheaves , it is the case that very different sites may yield equivalent toposes , and it is the toposes , rather than the sites , that provide the right notion of generalized space . in particular ,",
    "the category of locales @xmath4 is equivalent to a full subcategory of the category of grothendieck toposes @xmath5 , and the role played by toposes as spaces in their own right is emphasized by the existence of invariants such as homotopy and cohomology for them @xcite . indeed , the fact that toposes provide good grounds on which to study cohomology is precisely one the reasons that led grothendieck to consider them @xcite .",
    "a `` measure '' of how far toposes really differ from locales is provided by the representation theorem of joyal and tierney : a grothendieck topos is , up to equivalence , the category of equivariant sheaves on an open groupoid in @xmath4 .",
    "similarly to the situation with sites , groupoids themselves should be regarded as presentations of spaces rather than spaces themselves , since two groupoids yield equivalent toposes if and only if they are morita equivalent . for suitable open groupoids ( the tale - complete ones , in particular the tale groupoids",
    " see @xcite ) , the topos @xmath6 of equivariant sheaves on a groupoid @xmath1 is called the classifying topos of @xmath1 because it classifies principal @xmath1-bundles .",
    "it can also be thought of as the space of orbits of @xmath1 .",
    "a different way to represent grothendieck toposes ( and also more general categories ) stems from work on `` categories of relations '' by various authors .",
    "for instance , freyd s work on allegories dates back to the seventies and already contains many ingredients of later theories of sheaves on involutive quantaloids .",
    "one is the equivalence of categories @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the involutive quantaloid of binary relations on a grothendieck topos @xmath9 and @xmath10 its category of `` maps '' , which are the arrows @xmath11 in @xmath8 satisfying @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "another idea is the completion @xcite that replaces a quantaloid by a suitable category of matrices that play the role of sheaves .",
    "a different characterization of categories of relations is that of carboni and walters @xcite , based on which pitts @xcite has obtained an adjunction between the 2-category of grothendieck toposes and the 2-category of quantaloids known as distributive categories of relations ( dcr s for short ) .",
    "the construction of the category of sheaves on a dcr by matrices is analogous to completion for allegories in @xcite .",
    "this also parallels the representation of toposes by localic groupoids : dcr s are another generalization of locales because a dcr is a sup - lattice enriched category @xmath14 equipped with a suitable product @xmath15 that turns it into a `` locale with many objects '' ( a fancy name would be `` localoid '' ) in the sense that if @xmath14 has only one object then it is a locale and the product is @xmath16 ( we also note that involution and intersection are not primitive operations as in an allegory ) ; every grothendieck topos arises as the category of sheaves on a dcr .",
    "still another representation of grothendieck toposes by involutive quantaloids can be found in the work of walters @xcite , which shows how to associate an involutive quantaloid @xmath17 to any site in such a way that the topos is equivalent to the category of sheaves on @xmath17 . here",
    "the notion of `` sheaf '' is that of skeletal cauchy - complete @xmath17-enriched category .",
    "similarly to the previous examples , such sheaves can again be regarded as matrices and again they generalize frame - valued sets , but there are some technical differences , in particular the fact that they must lie above identity matrices .",
    "this difference can be quickly described in the case of sheaves on a locale @xmath14 : whereas @xmath14-valued sets directly model sheaves on @xmath14 , walters approach uses categories enriched in the quantaloid @xmath17 that arises as the split idempotent completion of @xmath14 @xcite .",

    "several variants of this idea have been pursued for c*-algebras @xcite and arbitrary rings @xcite , often involving classes of quantales that satisfy specific properties , along with purely algebraic investigations of the spatial aspects of quantales @xcite .",

    "the idea that quantales can be regarded as spaces leads naturally to the question of how such spaces can be studied , for instance via which cohomology theories , etc .",
    "while there has never been a systematic pursuit in this direction , there has nevertheless been some effort aimed at finding good notions of sheaf on quantales or , more generally , on quantaloids .",
    "this effort is justified by a number of reasons .",
    "one , of course , is the possibility of using sheaves in order to define topological invariants for quantales and for the objects they are associated with .",
    "another motivation for looking at quantale or quantaloid sheaves is the role they may play as structure sheaves when studying spectra of noncommutative rings or c*-algebras @xcite ; in particular , there is interest in understanding more about the sheaves on the quantale @xmath18 of a c*-algebra @xmath14 due to the hope that a suitable notion of structure sheaf may do away with the excess of quantale homomorphisms that make @xmath19 a somewhat ill - behaved functor @xcite . also interesting",
    "is the possibility of obtaining useful extensions of the _ k_-theory sheaves of @xcite in the context of the program of classification of c*-algebras .    despite a few exceptions @xcite , most of the papers on sheaves for quantales or quantaloids are to a greater or lesser extent based on the definition of sheaves as matrices ( frame - valued sets ) introduced originally for sheaves on locales .",
    "many technicalities depend , of course , on the specific types of quantales or quantaloids under consideration .",
    "for instance , there have been direct generalizations of frame - valued sets for right - sided or left - sided quantales @xcite , which are those that model quantales of right - sided ( resp .",
    "left - sided ) ideals of rings .",
    "there have also been proposals for definitions of sheaf on general quantaloids @xcite that carry a generalization of frame - valued sets , but it has been shown by borceux and cruciani @xcite that such definitions applied to general non - involutive quantales should at most give us a notion of ordered sheaf , rather than a discrete one .",
    "subsequent work by stubbe @xcite adheres to this point of view while also generalizing the bicategorical enrichment approach of walters @xcite .    for ( discrete )",
    "sheaves one needs the base quantale or quantaloid @xmath0 to be equipped with an involution in order to be able to define self - adjoint @xmath0-valued matrices ( equivalently , in order to define a `` symmetric '' notion of @xmath0-valued equality ) .",
    "for instance , the quantaloids that appear in the early works on categories of relations mentioned above are involutive , and the matrices that correspond to sheaves on them are self - adjoint . for more general involutive quantales and quantaloids a fairly stable theory of sheaves seems to be emerging , with many basic definitions being close in spirit , if not in form . for instance , sheaves on involutive quantaloids have been studied by gylys @xcite .",
    "slightly later garraway @xcite extended the theory of sheaves on dcr s of @xcite to a rather general class of non - unital quantaloids , while ramos @xcite has produced a theory for involutive quantales directly inspired by the axiomatic approach of @xcite .",
    "more recently , heymans @xcite has provided a study of sheaves based on quantaloid enriched categories in the style of walters @xcite , making the connections to @xcite explicit and leading to a representation theorem for grothendieck toposes by so - called grothendieck quantales @xcite .    while the theory of sheaves on involutive quantaloids appears to be thriving ,",
    "a negative aspect should nevertheless be mentioned , namely that so far the increase in generality of the theory has not been accompanied by a corresponding rise in the number of known examples .",

    "to each tale groupoid @xmath1 one also associates an involutive quantale @xmath2 @xcite ( for a topological groupoid this quantale is just the topology equipped with pointwise multiplication of groupoid arrows ) , and the natural question of how @xmath1-sheaves relate to @xmath2 arises . in @xcite it has been proved that the @xmath1-sheaves correspond to a class of modules on @xmath2 , called the tale @xmath2-locales , which are the objects of two isomorphic categories that are equivalent to @xmath6 .",
    "this provides a way of representing tendues by quantales .",
    "the tale @xmath2-locales can be regarded as sheaves on @xmath2 in their own right : any quantale of the form @xmath2 has an associated `` base locale '' ( isomorphic to @xmath20 ) , and the tale @xmath2-locales are the natural embodiment of the idea of an equivariant sheaf for a quantale @xmath0 that is equipped with a suitably defined base locale @xmath21 ; that is , a sheaf on @xmath21 equipped with an action of @xmath0 .",
    "however , there is no immediate way of extending this construction in the absence of base locales , and the relation to the earlier matrix - based definitions of sheaves for involutive quantales should be investigated .",

    "then , in part ii , we establish an isomorphism , in the case where @xmath22 for an tale groupoid @xmath1 , between the category of sheaves on @xmath0 and the category of tale @xmath0-locales , which in turn is equivalent to @xmath6 .    besides the main results , in part i we provide an overview of definitions and results concerning quantales , quantaloids and sheaves - as - matrices . in particular , in section 1",

    "part ii contains subsidiary material , too : the quantales of tale groupoids are called inverse quantal frames , they are examples of stably supported quantales @xcite , and section 5 provides an overview of this along with small results of independent interest and a comparison with the quantales that satisfy the modularity law of freyd ; then section 6 studies a notion of support for hilbert modules that generalizes the supports of involutive quantales , which is useful for studying sheaves on stably supported quantales . the latter is done in order to help rationalize the presentation but also because , independently of groupoids , such quantales are useful in their own right @xcite .",
    "we hope that our results provide further evidence of what should be considered a `` good '' notion of sheaf for involutive quantales and quantaloids , and we provide a brief discussion of this at the end of section 7 .    a word of caution : in order to avoid unnecessary clutter , the lemmas , theorems , examples , etc .",

    "the _ support _ @xmath209 of an element @xmath203 is @xmath466 , where @xmath239 is the @xmath17-sheaf inner product , and we refer to the map @xmath432 thus defined as the _ support of @xmath52 _ (  [ exm : hilbmodlocsecs ] ) .    as stated in the introduction , the notion of tale @xmath0-locale provides us with a natural way in which to define what should be meant by a `` @xmath0-equivariant sheaf on the base locale @xmath17 '' .",
    "as also mentioned in the introduction , we emphasize that such a notion of sheaf only makes sense because there is a base locale .",

    "an alternative , but isomorphic , category with the same objects as @xmath0-@xmath467 is defined by taking as homomorphisms the direct images @xmath335 of the maps @xmath85 .",
    "these direct images coincide with the homomorphisms of the following definition :    [ sheafhom ] let @xmath52 and @xmath244 be tale @xmath0-locales . by a _ sheaf homomorphism _",
    "@xmath255 is meant a homomorphism of left @xmath0-modules that preserves supports and local sections ; that is , @xmath468                  let @xmath52 be an arbitrary but fixed @xmath0-sheaf , and let us just write @xmath226 for the hilbert basis @xmath219 .",
    "the action restricts to an action of @xmath17 and we shall prove that this defines a @xmath17-sheaf by showing that it has a hilbert @xmath17-module structure with respect to which @xmath226 is a hilbert basis .",
    "first , by the _ local inner product _ will be meant the operation @xmath475 defined by @xmath476 the operation @xmath477 is of course symmetric , and it preserves joins in the left variable because @xmath478 does and @xmath0 is a locale : @xmath479 we show that @xmath477 is @xmath17-equivariant in the left variable , using [ prop : sqf ] : @xmath480 hence , @xmath52 together with the local inner product is a pre - hilbert @xmath17-module . in order to see that this is a @xmath17-sheaf",
    "let us prove that @xmath226 is itself a hilbert basis for the pre - hilbert @xmath17-module structure ; that is , we shall prove that for all @xmath203 we have @xmath481 .",
    "one inequality is trivial : @xmath482 in order to prove the other inequality , first we apply ( [ spp9 ] ) with @xmath483 and @xmath484 :          a particular choice of @xmath486 and @xmath487 for which @xmath488 is to take @xmath489 and @xmath490 , and thus with these values of @xmath486 and @xmath487 the right hand side of ( [ continued ] ) is greater than or equal to @xmath491 where the transition to the last line follows from [ hs2lemma ] .",
    "hence , we have concluded that @xmath492 for all @xmath493 , which finally gives us : @xmath494                      let @xmath52 be an arbitrary but fixed tale @xmath0-locale .",
    "the proof has two parts : first , we construct a @xmath0-set @xmath505 ; then , we prove that the @xmath0-sheaf @xmath506 (  [ lemma : matrixtomod ] ) is isomorphic to @xmath52 .",
    "in addition , for all @xmath512 we have @xmath513 because from ( [ doubleproof ] ) we obtain @xmath514 , and from @xmath508 and ( [ mst3 ] ) we obtain @xmath515 , whence @xmath516 it follows that @xmath517 , and we conclude that @xmath518 . furthermore , for all @xmath512 and @xmath519 we have @xmath520 : @xmath521 hence , @xmath522 .",
    "this shows that we have @xmath523 , and , since @xmath0 is stably gelfand , @xmath505 is a @xmath0-set (  [ thmqsets ] ) .",
    "therefore , by [ lemma : matrixtomod ] , we have a @xmath0-sheaf @xmath506 , whose inner product is the dot product of @xmath195 , with a hilbert basis @xmath226 consisting of the rows of @xmath314 . using the same notation as in [ lemma : matrixtomod ] , for each @xmath347 we denote the @xmath214-row of @xmath314 by @xmath348 .",
    "the local inner product @xmath524 of @xmath506 (  [ thm : qsheaf ] ) satisfies , for all @xmath525 , @xmath526 therefore all the expressions in the above derivation are equal , and we obtain @xmath527 since @xmath528 is the @xmath17-valued inner product of @xmath52 regarded as a @xmath17-sheaf , we conclude , by the representation theorem [ lem : hmbisloc ] ( or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 5 ) ) , that @xmath529 , where @xmath530 is the matrix defined by @xmath531 .",
    "since this matrix is also that of the local inner product of @xmath506 , it follows that @xmath532 , and thus @xmath52 is a @xmath0-sheaf .",
    "we can provide a more geometric interpretation of the formula ( [ mst2 ] ) in terms of the groupoid @xmath1 rather than its quantale @xmath0 , whereby @xmath533 is the union of all the local bisections @xmath26 that satisfy the following three conditions (  [ exmtopologicalgroupoid ] ) :    * the domain of @xmath26 is contained in the domain of the local section @xmath214 ; * the image of @xmath534 is contained in the domain of the local section @xmath422 ; * @xmath26 acts on @xmath422 yielding a subsection of @xmath214 .",
    "hence , the logical interpretation of @xmath1-sheaves , as @xmath0-sets , generalizes that of @xmath17-sets of @xcite in such a way that the truth values are no longer just locale elements but rather quantale elements that convey a dynamic notion of `` equality '' of local sections , which now is defined up to local translations rather than just restriction as in a @xmath17-sheaf .      from ( * ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.1 ) , which applies to modular quantal frames , and hence also to inverse quantal frames , it follows that a left @xmath0-module is a @xmath0-sheaf with respect to at most one inner product .",
    "hence , being a @xmath0-sheaf is a property rather than extra structure .",
    "similarly , being an tale @xmath0-locale is a property , and the results that we have just obtained show that the two properties coincide .",
    "let @xmath52 and @xmath244 be @xmath0-sheaves and let @xmath255 be a homomorphism of left @xmath0-modules .",
    "we have @xmath535 for all @xmath203 and @xmath247 , and thus also @xmath536 where @xmath537 is the local inner product of [ thm : qsheaf ] , defined by @xmath538 .",
    "this shows that @xmath249 is the dual of @xmath251 both with respect to the inner products of @xmath52 and @xmath244 as @xmath0-sheaves , and their inner products as @xmath17-sheaves .",
    "now let @xmath85 be a map of tale @xmath0-locales .",
    "this is also a map of tale @xmath17-locales , and hence it is a local homeomorphism .",
    "its direct image @xmath539 is the left adjoint of @xmath90 and it coincides with the dual @xmath540 @xcite , whence @xmath539 is a direct image homomorphism of @xmath0-sheaves ( and a sheaf homomorphism ) .",
    "therefore , we have an obvious isomorphism of categories @xmath0-@xmath541-@xmath332 ; the object part is the identity and the arrow part sends each map @xmath11 to @xmath539 .",
    "* for an tale groupoid @xmath1 the @xmath2-sheaves give us the classifying topos of @xmath1 ; * for supported quantales a natural definition of `` equivariant sheaf '' is that of tale @xmath0-locale and , as we have seen , for an inverse quantal frame @xmath0 the tale @xmath0-locales coincide with the @xmath0-sheaves ; * the class of stably gelfand quantales , for which several minor variations in the definitions of sheaf and sheaf morphism vanish , includes the main examples of quantales - as - spaces beyond locales .",
    "another natural criterion for assessing the value of any notion of quantale sheaf is that of whether the categories of sheaves are toposes .",
    "this topic has been very recently addressed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 4.4.12 ) by showing that the category of @xmath0-sheaves is a grothendieck topos if and only if @xmath0 is a so - called _ grothendieck quantale _ , by which is meant a modular quantal frame that satisfies an additional simple algebraic condition .",
    "( in particular , inverse quantal frames are grothendieck quantales . )",
    "this criterion leaves out stable quantal frames which , as we have seen (  [ exm : ssqnotmod ] ) , are more general than modular quantal frames but nevertheless form an algebraically nice class of quantales .",
    "while it is not inconceivable that a slightly more restricted notion of sheaf might be appropriate for stable quantal frames , especially if this yields toposes of sheaves , presently not much motivation seems to exist in order to pursue this question due to the unavailability of natural examples of stable quantal frames beyond those that are inverse quantal frames ( despite which there may be reasons for addressing even more general stably supported quantales , as hinted at in the beginning of section [ sec : ssq ] ) .",
    "nevertheless we remark that any stable quantal frame @xmath0 has a base locale @xmath17 , and that in those particular cases where @xmath0 is an inverse quantal frame every @xmath0-sheaf is also a @xmath17-sheaf , as has been proved in theorem [ thm : qsheaf ] .",
    "this is a rather natural property , but it depends crucially on the fact that the hilbert sections of a @xmath0-sheaf @xmath52 cover @xmath52 , which is false in general for sheaves on arbitrary stable quantal frames , as example [ exm : hilbsec3 ] shows .",
    "hence , if @xmath0 is a stable quantal frame , we regard this cover condition as an example of an axiom that may make sense adding to the definition of @xmath0-sheaf .",
