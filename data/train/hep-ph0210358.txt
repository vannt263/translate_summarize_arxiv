    "the tau  charm factory , a high  luminosity ( @xmath2 ) @xmath3 collider with a centre  of  mass energy near the @xmath4 production threshold , has been proposed as a powerful tool to perform high  precision studies of the @xmath5 lepton , charm hadrons and the charmonium system @xcite . in recent years",
    ", this energy region has been only partially explored by the chinese bebc machine ( @xmath6 ) . the possibility to operate",
    "the cornell cesr collider around the @xmath4 threshold @xcite has revived again the interest on tau  charm factory physics .",
    "also the cmd-2 detector at the novosibirsk vepp-2 m @xmath3 collider will be soon ready to collect new data in this region @xcite .    a precise understanding of the @xmath7 production cross section near threshold is clearly required .",
    "the accurate experimental analysis of this observable could allow to improve the present measurement @xcite of the @xmath5 lepton mass .",
    "the cross section @xmath0 has already been analysed to @xmath8 in refs .",
    "@xcite , including a resummation of the leading coulomb corrections .",
    "the recent development of non - relativistic effective field theories of qed ( nrqed ) and qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite has allowed an extensive investigation of the threshold production of heavy flavours at @xmath3 colliders .",
    "the threshold @xmath9 @xcite and @xmath10 @xcite production cross sections have been computed to the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in a combined expansion in powers of @xmath11 and the fermion velocities . making appropriate changes , those calculations can be easily applied to the study of @xmath4 production @xcite .",
    "one can then achieve a theoretical precision better than 0.1% .",
    "at lowest order in qed , the @xmath5 leptons are produced by one - photon exchange in the s - channel , and the total cross section formula reads @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the velocity of the final @xmath5 leptons in the center - of - mass frame of the @xmath15 pair which makes @xmath16 vanish when @xmath17 .",
    "electromagnetic corrections of @xmath18 arise from the interference between the tree level result and 1-loop amplitudes .",
    "a factor @xmath19 emerges in the 1-loop final state interaction between the tau leptons , making the cross section at threshold finite .",
    "furry s theorem guarantees that contributions to @xmath20 coming from initial , intermediate and final state corrections completely factorize at @xmath8 , including real photon emission .",
    "some undesirable features appear at @xmath21 : the two - loop @xmath22 vertex develops an @xmath23 term which makes the cross section ill - defined when @xmath24 , and multiple photon production of tau leptons by box - type diagrams and the non - zero interference of initial and final state radiation spoil exact factorization .",
    "however , as it has been recently shown @xcite , the squared amplitude of the @xmath25 box diagram ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : boxes ] ) is proportional to @xmath26 , and so represents a n@xmath27lo correction in the combined expansion in powers of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , far beyond the scope of this analysis .",
    "in addition , contributions to the total cross section from diagrams with real photons emitted from the produced taus can be shown to begin at n@xmath30lo , and factorization remains at nnlo .",
    "the total cross section can thus be written as an integration over the product of separate pieces including initial , intermediate and final state corrections : @xmath31 the radiation function @xmath32 @xcite describes initial state radiation , including virtual corrections .",
    "the integration accounts for the effective energy loss due to photon emission from the @xmath15 pair , and it includes the largest corrections coming from the emission of an arbitrary number of initial photons , which can sizable suppress the total cross section .",
    "@xmath33 collects only final - state interactions between the tau leptons , and it is usually written in terms of the tau spectral density @xmath34 , @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "the threshold behaviour of the total cross section will be ruled by the expansion of @xmath34 at low velocities .",
    "_ direct and crossed box diagrams for @xmath37._,scaledwidth=50.0%,height=75 ]",
    "the aim of the effective field theory approach to threshold particle production is to achieve a given accuracy in the combined expansion in powers of @xmath28 and the velocity @xmath29 .",
    "such double expansion is needed at threshold due to the appearance of @xmath38 terms in the qed perturbative expansion at the @xmath39-th loop order , which forces one to treat @xmath28 and @xmath29 on the same footing .",
    "a non - perturbative procedure to deal with such singular terms in the limit @xmath17 is therefore mandatory .    the leading divergences ( i.e. @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) , emerging from the ladder diagrams with coulomb photons shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : coulomb ] , are resummed in the well - known sommerfeld factor @xcite @xmath42 multiplying the born cross section  ( [ s0 ] ) .",
    "next - to - leading order ( nlo ) entails terms proportional to @xmath43 $ ] , while nnlo accuracy stands for contributions @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "_ ladder exchange of photons between produced fermions._,scaledwidth=30.0%,height=113 ]    a systematic way to calculate these higher - order corrections in this regime requires the use of a simplified theory which keeps the relevant physics at the scale @xmath45 , characteristic of the coulomb interaction .",
    "nrqed @xcite was designed precisely for this purpose .",
    "it is an effective field theory of qed at low energies , applicable to fermions in non - relativistic regimes , i.e. with typical momenta @xmath46 .",
    "interactions contained in the nrqed lagrangian have a definite velocity counting but propagators and loop integrations can also generate powers of @xmath29 . with appropriate counting rules at hand , one can prove that all interactions between the non - relativistic pair @xmath4 can be described up to nnlo in terms of time - independent potentials @xcite , derived from the low - energy lagrangian .",
    "therefore , the low - energy expression of the @xmath5 spectral density is related with the non - relativistic green s functions @xcite : @xmath47 with @xmath48 a short distance coefficient to be determined by matching full and effective theory results and @xmath49 the non - relativistic energy .",
    "the details of this derivation can be found in the appendix b of @xcite .",
    "the green s function @xmath50 obeys the schrdinger equation corresponding to a two - body system interacting through potentials derived from @xmath51 at nnlo : @xmath52 the term @xmath53 is the first relativistic correction to the kinetic energy .",
    "@xmath54 stands for the coulomb potential with @xmath55 corrections . at nnlo ,",
    "the heavy leptons are only produced in triplet s - wave states , so we just need to consider the corresponding projection of the breit - fermi potential @xmath56 .",
    "finally , @xmath57 is a nnlo piece derived from a contact term in @xmath51 , which reproduces the qed tree level s - channel diagram for the process @xmath58 .",
    "a solution of eq .  ( [ schrodingerfull ] ) must rely on numerical or perturbative techniques . in the qed case , a significant difference between both approaches",
    "is not expected , being @xmath28 such a small parameter .",
    "consequently we follow the perturbative approach , using recent results @xcite , where nlo and nnlo corrections to the green s function are calculated analytically , via rayleigh - schrdinger time - independent perturbation theory around the known lo coulomb green s function @xmath59 .",
    "we refer the reader to appendix c of @xcite for complete expressions of the green s function corrections .",
    "for a complete nnlo description of @xmath60 , two - loop corrections to the photon propagator should be included .",
    "the light lepton contributions to the vacuum polarization are the standard 1- and 2-loop perturbative expressions . for the @xmath5 contribution in the threshold vicinity @xmath61 , resummation of singular terms in the limit",
    "@xmath17 is again mandatory . under the assumption @xmath62",
    ", we need to know nlo contributions to @xmath63 , performing the direct matching for both real and imaginary parts .    in the hadronic sector",
    ", we can relate the hadronic vacuum polarization with the total cross section @xmath64 .",
    "below 1  gev , the electromagnetic production of hadrons is dominated by the @xmath65 resonance and its decay to two charged pions .",
    "the photon mediated @xmath66 production cross section is driven by the pion electromagnetic form factor @xmath67 . an analytic expression for @xmath67",
    "was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , using resonance chiral theory and the restrictions imposed by analyticity and unitarity .",
    "the obtained @xmath67 provides an excellent description of experimental data up to energies of the order @xmath68 1  gev@xmath69 .    for the integration region above @xmath70 , we use @xmath71 as calculated from pqcd . our simple estimate has been proved @xcite to deviate by less than 5@xmath72 for the running of @xmath28 at the scale @xmath73 . considering that @xmath74 modifies @xmath20 near threshold by roughly @xmath75 ,",
    "our result has a global uncertainty smaller than @xmath76 for the total cross section .",
    "clearly , our antsaz could be easily improved using a more realistic hadronic spectrum , and , indeed , most experiments have their own routines to accurately implement vacuum polarization together with initial state radiation in their data analyses .",
    "electroweak production of heavy quarks including threshold effects has already been studied in previous papers @xcite , and can be easily incorporated in our basic formula ( [ secradr ] ) . however , the characteristic @xmath77 suppression of this set of corrections and the small value of the neutral - current couplings of the leptons make these terms fully negligible in our analysis .",
    "green s functions develop energy poles below threshold corresponding to spin triplet ( n@xmath78 ) electromagnetic @xmath4 bound states .",
    "the small width of these bound levels , dominated by their @xmath3 decay rate @xmath79 make these states very difficult to be resolved experimentally .",
    "for the same reason , the bound states can not affect the shape of the cross section at threshold , contrary to the case of heavy quark threshold production , where bound states play a crucial role .",
    "the spectral density @xmath80 at low velocities in both qed and nrqed.,scaledwidth=50.0%,height=207 ]    the need for performing resummations of the leading non - relativistic terms @xmath81 $ ] is evidenced in fig .  [",
    "fig : rthreshold ] .",
    "the qed spectral density vanishes as @xmath82 , due to the phase space velocity in formula ( [ s0 ] ) , which is canceled by the first @xmath83 term appearing in the @xmath84 correction , making the cross section at threshold finite .",
    "more singular terms near threshold , @xmath85 arising in higher - order corrections completely spoil the expected good convergence of the qed perturbative series at low @xmath29 .",
    "this is no longer the case for the effective theory perturbative series , whose convergence improves as we approach the threshold point , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rsizes ] , and higher - order corrections reduce the perturbative uncertainty . in the whole energy range displayed in fig .  [",
    "fig : rsizes ] , the differences between the nnlo , nlo and lo results are below 0.8% , which indicates that the lo result , i.e. the sommerfeld factor , contains the relevant physics to describe the threshold region .      adding the intermediate and initial state corrections we have a complete description of the total cross section of @xmath4 production , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kirk ] . coulomb interaction between the produced @xmath5 s , becomes essential within few mev s above the threshold , and its effects have to be taken into account to all orders .",
    "initial state radiation effectively reduces the available center - of - mass energy for @xmath5 production , lowering in this way the total cross section .",
    "we should emphasize that nnlo corrections do not modify the predicted behaviour of the lo and nlo cross section , but are essential to guarantee that the truncated perturbative series at nlo gets small corrections from higher - order terms .",
    "differences with previous evaluations mainly concern the correct resummation of nnlo terms @xmath87 $ ] , which on perturbative grounds means that our results should differ by @xmath88 terms .",
    "the latter are seemingly negligible , but one has to check that all - order resummation of them does not produce any unexpected enhancement .",
    "in addition , factorized formulas proposed in previous works do not have under control the nnlo terms being resummed beyond the order in @xmath28 at which the matching between the non - relativistic and the qed results is performed .",
    "these fake resummations may be harmless in qed , being @xmath28 such a small parameter , but must be handled with care when estimating the uncertainties of the theoretical calculation . in that sense , notice in fig .",
    "[ fig : rsizes ] that nnlo corrections to the spectral density are not @xmath89 with respect to the leading - order , as we would naively estimate .",
    "hence , we can safely conclude that the theoretical uncertainty of our analysis of @xmath60 at energies close to threshold is lower than 0.1% . a fortran code which evaluates the spectral density @xmath90 will be soon available at * http://alpha.ific.uv.es/@xmath91ruiz",
