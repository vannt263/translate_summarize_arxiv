    "cooperative communication based on relay has been seen as one of the promising techniques since 1970s @xcite to improve network coverage as well as throughput . since then , considerable work has been done to explore cooperation strategies from various perspectives .",
    "to take the advantages of the multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) technique , e.g. improving spectrum utilization and link reliability , mimo relay networks were introduced in @xcite where the capacity maximization problem under fixed source and relay transmit power thresholds was investigated . in @xcite and @xcite , relay only and joint source and relay optimization schemes were considered with fixed source covariance matrix and arbitrary source covariance matrix , respectively .",
    "then in @xcite , joint source and relay design was investigated for mimo - ofdm relay networks .    with green communication becoming an important tendency of next generation wireless communication , recently ,",
    "researchers have started paying attention to the combination of energy harvesting technique and cooperative communication due to the limited battery storage of the relay nodes @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the outage probability and the ergodic capacity were analyzed for one - way relaying system with energy harvesting while @xcite focused on the power allocation strategies for multiple source - destination pair cooperative relay networks . in @xcite ,",
    "energy harvesting was introduced to the cooperative networks with spatially random relays and the outage and diversity performance were investigated using stochastic geometry . in @xcite , the distributed power splitting ( ps ) based simultaneous wireless information and power transfer ( swipt ) was studied for interference relay channels using game theory .",
    "these works only considered swipt in single antenna and single - carrier relay networks .    later in @xcite ,",
    "swipt was considered for a multi - antenna relay network with single antenna source and destination nodes .",
    "aimed to minimize the transmit power at the relay subject to the signal - to - inference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) and energy harvesting constraints with imperfect channel state information ( csi ) , joint optimization of beamforming and power splitting ( ps ) ratio was considered in @xcite based on semidefinite programming problem ( sdp ) . in @xcite , the authors focused on the optimal precoding for swipt in a two - hop decode - and - forward ( df ) mimo relay network with energy harvesting at the destination .",
    "a suboptimal and an iterative approaches guided by semidefinite relaxation ( sdr ) were developed in @xcite for a half - duplex two - way af mimo relay network with a power - splitting based energy harvesting source node aiming to minimize the total mean - squared error ( mse ) .",
    "note that the works in @xcite provided important results for swipt in mimo relay networks depending on either sdr and existing solvers or iterative methods , but they failed to provide the close - form solutions as well as the structures of the source covariance and relay beamforming matrices .",
    "also , the joint ps ratio and precoding matrices design is not well investigated for generic mimo relay systems @xcite .    in this paper , power - splitting based energy harvesting",
    "is considered for mimo relay networks . in order to derive the maximum capacity with power constraints at the source and relay nodes",
    ", we first consider the case of fixed source covariance matrix to optimize relay beamforming and power splitting ratio at the relay node .",
    "then we jointly design the source covariance matrix , relay beamforming matrix and ps ratio . instead of using sdr and software solvers",
    ", we provide the structures of the optimal source covariance and relay precoding matrix based on which iterative approaches are employed to derive the near - optimal results .",
    "finally , numerical simulations are carried out to investigate the performance of the proposed schemes .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec_sys ] , the system model of a mimo relay network with power splitting based energy harvesting relay node",
    "is introduced .",
    "the fixed source covariance matrix case is elaborated in section  [ sec_algo_relay ] while the joint transmit and relay precoding matrices along with power splitting ratio design algorithm is developed in section  [ sec_algo_joint ] .",
    "section  [ sec_sim ] shows the simulation results which justify the significance of the proposed algorithms under various scenarios .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section  [ sec_con ] .",
    "as shown in fig .  [ sysmod ] , a two - hop mimo relay network is considered with power splitting based energy harvesting at the relay node where all the nodes are equipped with multiple antennas .",
    "the numbers of antennas for the source , relay and destination nodes are @xmath0 , and @xmath1 , respectively , with the number of transmit data streams @xmath2 satisfying @xmath3 .    assuming non - regenerative and half - duplex relaying ,",
    "the signal transmission can be divided into two phases , the source transmission phase and the relay forwarding phase . in the first phase ,",
    "information and energy are simultaneously transmitted from the source to the relay while in the second phase the relay forwards the received signals to the destination using the harvested energy from the source .",
    "we assume that the source has fixed energy supply and the relay helps forward information to the destination node using the energy harvested from the source in the first phase .",
    "the frame of ps based mimo relay networks is shown in fig .",
    "let @xmath4 be the block length and split the time equally between the two phases .",
    "@xmath5 is defined as the ps ratio . as can be observed , in the first phase , @xmath5 of the received signal",
    "is used for energy harvesting while the rest is used for information forwarding from the relay to the destination . in the second phase ,",
    "the information received at relay is forwarded to the destination using the energy harvested in the first phase .        to better clarify the expressions ,",
    "we summarize some commonly used symbols in table i.    .symbol notations [ cols=\"^ , < \" , ]     [ table1 ]",
    "in the uniform source pre - coding case , i.e. @xmath6@xmath7@xmath8 , the harvested power at relay in the first phase can then be written as @xmath9 where we let the received signal for energy harvesting @xmath10 and the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) at the relay @xmath11 . here",
    "we assume that the antenna noise is relatively smaller and can therefore be ignored .",
    "the received signal at relay for information processing is given by @xmath12 then in the second phase , the receive signal at destination is @xmath13 in this case , the achievable rate can be written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "then we consider the power constraint at relay which is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 denotes the energy convention efficiency .",
    "consequently , the optimization problem of interest is    [ maxrob1 ] @xmath19    clearly , the objective is neither convex nor concave .",
    "hence , the optimization problem can not been solved directly .",
    "we consider updating @xmath20 and @xmath5 alternatingly .",
    "let us now define @xmath21 and fix @xmath22 .",
    "the problem then becomes similar to the one in @xcite .",
    "consequently , we consider the singular value decompositions ( svds ) of the channel matrices shown below @xmath23 where @xmath24 are diagonal matrices while others are unitary . it can be shown , as in @xcite , that the optimal relay matrix has structure @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes a diagonal matrix .",
    "let @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a diagonal matrix with @xmath29 .",
    "in addition , we let @xmath30 , @xmath31 be diagonal matrices with the vectors @xmath32 $ ] and @xmath33 $ ] as the diagonal , respectively .",
    "problem ( [ maxrob1 ] ) then becomes a scalar optimization problem :    [ maxrob_2_3 ] @xmath34    where @xmath35.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] considering the lagrangian , the dual problem can be expressed as    [ maxrob3 ] @xmath36    based on the karush - kuhn - tucker ( kkt ) conditions , we have    [ minrob6 ] @xmath37    using ( [ r6_2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath38 due to the fact that @xmath39 , it holds that @xmath40    considering ( [ r6_1 ] ) , we have @xmath41=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    then following the similar steps as in @xcite , the optimal @xmath42 can be derived as @xmath43^+\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 and @xmath45 can be obtained from ( [ r6_3 ] ) .",

    "now we need to check the availability of root - searching for @xmath49 .",
    "obviously , @xmath50 descends when @xmath51 .",

    "to be exact , we have @xmath56 and @xmath57 in contrast , it is obvious that @xmath58 , when @xmath59 , and thus we know that @xmath60    consequently , an optimal @xmath61 satisfying @xmath62 can always be found within @xmath63 by root - finding strategies such as bisection searching .",

    "in this section , we consider a more general scenario of optimal source covariance matrix and thus the source covariance matrix , relay beamforming matrix and ps ratio need to be jointly optimized .    in this case , the achievable rate of the mimo relay system with ps based energy harvesting can be expressed as @xmath70    then the capacity maximization problem with power constraints at both the source and relay nodes can be written as    [ maxrobd ] @xmath71    to take the advantages of the results already obtained in the uniform source precoding case , we introduce an equivalent channel @xmath72 and thus find that the structure of the optimal relay beamforming still works .",
    "that is to say , @xmath73 .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath74 is diagonal , and @xmath75 comes from the svd @xmath76 .",
    "moreover , because the objective function and the transmit power constraint at relay only depend on @xmath77 but not on @xmath75 , it was claimed in @xcite that the optimal @xmath78 must require the least transmit power .",
    "although power splitting based energy harvesting is introduced , it can be proved that the structures of the optimal source covariance and relay beamforming matrices in @xcite still work by defining a new variable @xmath79 .",
    "so the optimal structures of the source and relay matrices in ( [ maxrobd ] ) can be written as @xmath80 where @xmath81 are diagonal matrices .",
    "@xmath82 have been defined in ( [ channel ] ) and ( [ channel1 ] ) .",
