    "cool white dwarfs are typically identified through the combination of proper motion and apparent magnitude called reduced proper motion @xcite . at a given brightness and color",
    ", white dwarfs will have larger proper motions than main sequence stars owing to closer distances from the earth implied by their small radii .",
    "metal - poor stars , or subdwarfs , also stand out well in reduced proper motion diagrams due to their lower luminosities ( for the same color class ) and typically higher velocities .",
    "subluminous main sequence stars which distinguish themselves in reduced proper motion are kinematic members of the thick disk and halo @xcite .",
    "subdwarfs have long been a contaminant in surveys aiming to find cool white dwarfs because both stellar types are mixed in a reduced proper motion diagram at intermediate colors .",
    "cool white dwarfs must be confirmed spectroscopically @xcite .",
    "current complete and ongoing large - scale proper motion surveys are discovering numerous exotic objects including extreme subdwarfs , brown dwarfs , and cool white dwarfs ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "most if not all of these searches are utilizing available large - scale optical photographic sky survey catalogs .",
    "this is potentially problematic for the identification of cool white dwarfs because optical photographic bandpasses do not yield broad color baselines , and photographic photometry has intrinsically large errors .",
    "these facts lead to a large overlap in the white dwarf and subdwarf sequences in reduced proper motion diagrams @xcite .",
    "yet even with spectroscopy , subdwarfs and other weak - lined objects can appear featureless in low resolution and/or low signal - to - noise ( s / n ) measurements  potentially mistaken as dc white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "identification of degenerates with @xmath1 k should include good s / n spectroscopy covering blue - green optical wavelengths @xcite .    contrary to the claim of @xcite , this paper presents evidence that the high proper motion star ssspm j1549@xmath03544 ( @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 , @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 , j2000 ) is neither the nearest cool white dwarf nor a degenerate star , but rather a very high velocity halo star passing through the solar neighborhood .",
    "optical @xmath8 photometric data were obtained 14 february 2005 with the orthogonal parallel transfer imaging camera ( optic ; @xcite ) on the university of hawaii 2.2 meter telescope at mauna kea . observing conditions were photometric with seeing @xmath9 and some gusty winds @xmath10 mph .",
    "three identical exposures of ssspm j1549@xmath03544 were taken at each bandpass for a total integration time of @xmath11 seconds , yielding s / n @xmath12 at all wavelengths in a @xmath13 aperture radius .",
    "a standard landolt field @xcite was observed similarly immediately following the science target .",
    "the images were flat fielded , cleaned of bad pixels in the region of interest , and combined into a single frame at each wavelength for photometry .",
    "calibration was performed with three stars and aperture photometry was executed using standard iraf packages .",
    "calibrator stars were measured in a @xmath14 aperture radius and the science target data were corrected to this standard aperture and adjusted for relative extinction .",
    "the results are listed in table [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "optical @xmath15   spectroscopic data were obtained 18 march 2005 with the double beam spectrograph ( dbs ; @xcite ) on the australian national university 2.3 m telescope at siding spring observatory .",
    "only the red arm of the spectrograph was operated , with no dichroic in the beam .",
    "the 158 l / mm grating used gave a spectral resolution of 10   ( 2.5 pixels ) with the @xmath16 slit .",
    "the seeing was @xmath17 and the sky was clear .",
    "ssspm j1549@xmath03544 and the flux calibrator ltt 6248 were each observed for 600 seconds , yielding s / n @xmath18 over the majority of the science target wavelength shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the spectral images were flat fielded , cleaned of bad pixels in the region of interest , and flux calibrated spectra were extracted using standard iraf packages .",
    "the spectra were trimmed to show the region of interest , while no attempt was made to remove telluric features .",
    "the combined optical and near - infrared colors of ssspm j1549@xmath03544 are consistent with a main sequence star of @xmath19 k , late k spectral type @xcite .",
    "the near - infrared magnitudes are too bright for known cool and ultracool white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "for example , the reddest known degenerates have colors which peak near @xmath20 , after which they become bluer again as shown by observation and models ( excepting pure helium models at @xmath21 k ; @xcite ) , while ssspm j1549@xmath03544 has @xmath22 .",
    "the spectrum in figure [ fig1 ] confirms the status of ssspm j1549@xmath03544 as a nondegenerate star , and the deep mgh feature near 5200   indicates it is metal - poor @xcite .",
    "other unlabelled spectral features present include : weak h@xmath23 , several fe and ca lines , plus some weak cah and tio .",
    "these latter features are difficult to distinguish as they are located , for the most part , within and around the prominent telluric bands @xcite which are also seen in the calibrator star spectrum .    following the methodology of @xcite ,",
    "a spectral type and subdwarf class of ssspm j1549@xmath03544 was estimated by measuring the tio5 , cah1 , cah2 , & cah3 spectroscopic indices , which are listed in table [ tbl-2 ] . using equations @xmath24 in @xcite , a spectral type of k5",
    "is found consistently across all three relations , and type sdk5 is found using equation 7 in the same work . however , given the fact that the spectral resolution achieved here is @xmath25 times lower than that of @xcite , the spectroscopic measurments may be unreliable but are presented here as a rough guide .",
    "there are no distinctions between sdk and esdk stars before spectral type k7 , and , combined with the uncertain spectroscopy , it is difficult to say whether or not ssspm j1549@xmath03544 is an extreme subdwarf without a direct metallicity measurment . the mgh band near 5200   is quite strong and an extreme subdwarf classification might be appropriate @xcite .    in order to assess the kinematics of ssspm j1549@xmath03544",
    ", a distance must be estimated . conservatively assuming this star lies two magnitudes below the main sequence at spectral type k5",
    ", it would have @xmath26 mag @xcite .",
    "this would place the star at @xmath27 pc with a tangential speed of 430 km s@xmath28 based on the astrometic data in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , fourteen spectral lines ( many without high s / n ) were used to measure the radial velocity , the crude result being @xmath29 km s@xmath28 , corrected for the motion of the earth along the line of sight on the date of observation . combining all this data , a galactic @xmath30 space motion was calculated , corrected for the solar motion , @xmath31 km s@xmath28 @xcite , relative to the local standard of rest ( @xmath32 positive toward the galactic anticenter , @xmath33 positive in the direction of galactic rotation , @xmath34 positive toward the north galactic pole ) .",
    "the result is @xmath35 km s@xmath28 , making ssspm j1549@xmath03544 a halo star @xcite .",
    "if we instead assume @xmath36 due to the potential unreliability of the measured radial velocity , the result becomes @xmath37 km s@xmath28 , which is still consistent with halo membership . despite a fairly conservative assumption ,",
    "the 114 pc distance estimate and space motions should be considered preliminary as subdwarfs can span a wide range of absolute magnitudes .",
    "if ssspm j1549@xmath03544 is closer to 150 pc , or around 1.5 magnitudes below the main sequence , it would have a total heliocentric velocity in the range @xmath38 km s@xmath28 . at one magnitude below the main sequence , or 180 pc , ssspm",
    "j1549@xmath03544 would have a total galactocentric velocity of @xmath39 km s@xmath28 and would be among the fastest moving stars ever seen @xcite .",
    "the star ssspm j1549@xmath03544 is shown to be a metal - poor sdk star rather than a cool white dwarf as previously claimed @xcite .",
    "it is possible this star is an extreme k subdwarf , but in any case it is a very high velocity halo star passing through the solar neighborhood . with many new proper motion objects being discovered and studied ,",
    "it is critical to correctly distinguish cool white dwarfs from subdwarf contaminants .",
    "there is great science potential in the oldest degenerates .",
    "some data used in this paper are part of the two micron all sky survey , a joint project of the university of massachusetts and the infrared processing and analysis center / california institute of technology , funded by the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) and the national science foundation .",
