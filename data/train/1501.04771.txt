    "drag as a physical phenomenon in solids can be described as follows .",
    "consider a solid with two types of quasiparticles ( type 1 and type 2 ) .",
    "one creates a flux of the quasiparticles of type 2 , the so - called _ driving current_. as a result of the interaction between particles a current of quasiparticles of type 1 , the so - called _ drag current _ is excited .",
    "an example of such phenomenon is the coulomb drag where a current in conductor creates a current in adjacent conductor  see papers by pogrebinski  @xcite and price  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to consider a somewhat different situation where the driving current is created by real particles outside the conductor ( rather than by quasiparticles within it )",
    ". this would provide a _ contactless method _ to generate a drag current ( or voltage ) in a nanostructure .",
    "two formulations of the problem are feasible .    1 .",
    "the dragging flux consists of heavy ions of almost the same velocity @xmath0 .",
    "2 .   one considers a flux of weakly ionized gas that is in thermal equilibrium having some temperature @xmath5 and hydrodynamical velocity @xmath0 .    in the present paper",
    "we treat the first possibility . in other words",
    ", we consider an ion beam , i. e. a flux of ions having the same velocity @xmath0 .",
    "for the simplest situation the value of velocity @xmath0 is determined by the accelerating voltage @xmath6 and the ion mass @xmath7 as @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the charge of an ion .    for the drag system we will treat a ballistic ( collisionless ) electron transport in a quantum wire .",
    "such nanoscale systems may have rather low electron densities that can be varied by means of the gate voltage .",
    "the collisionless quantum wires act as waveguides for the electron de broglie waves . for a strong fermi degeneracy @xmath10 where @xmath5 is the temperature ( we will use the energy units for it ) while @xmath11 is the fermi energy , each miniband of transverse quantisation ( channel ) gives the following contribution to the conductance @xmath12 ( @xmath13 being the electron charge ) so that the total conductance is @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the number of such active channels , i. e. the minibands with bottoms @xmath16 below the fermi level @xmath11 .",
    "our purpose is to investigate the main features of this drag phenomenon .",
    "we assume that the distance @xmath17 between the ion beam and the wire is much larger than the width of the wire , so that on the scale of this width the coulomb interaction of ions and electrons is a smooth function .",
    "then the selection rules for the corresponding matrix elements require that electrons involved in the transitions change their quasimomenta but remain within the initial transverse quantized channel @xmath3 .",
    "one can vary the velocity @xmath0 of the ions with the accelerating voltage @xmath6 and measure the resulting variation of the drag current ( or drag voltage ) .",
    "we will denote by @xmath18 the volume occupied by the nanowire while @xmath19 will be the volume where the flux of ions propagates and interacts with the electrons of the nanowire .",
    "we assume both @xmath18 and @xmath19 to have a 1d shape of length @xmath20 parallel to @xmath21-axis .",
    "one can give the following qualitative considerations concerning the drag by an ion beam .",
    "due to the conservation of such quantities as the energy , the transverse quantized channel number @xmath3 and the ( quasi)momentum in the electron - ion collisions one has to consider in the born approximation the transition of electron from @xmath22 to @xmath23 state ( where @xmath24 is the @xmath21-component of electron quasimomentum ) and that of the ion from @xmath25 to @xmath26 state according to relation @xmath27 the @xmath28-function describing the energy conservation can be therefore written as @xmath29\\simeq\\ , \\frac{2m}{|q_z|}\\delta\\left[q_z-2(mv - p)\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath30 .",
    "further on we will take into account that @xmath31 and neglect @xmath32 as compared to 1 and @xmath33 as compared to @xmath34 .",
    "therefore the transferred ( quasi)momentum is @xmath35 and the probability of such a transition includes the factor @xmath36 as well as the electron - ion coulomb interaction matrix element squared . for the 1d situation under consideration it has a factor proportional to @xmath37 where @xmath17 is the distance between the ion beam and the wire and",
    "@xmath38 is the mcdonald function [ see below eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) ] .",
    "one can use for it the following approximate equations @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "the drag current is proportional to the sum over electron momenta @xmath24 of the products in eqs .",
    "( [ qc02 ] )  ( [ qc04 ] ) .",
    "we consider @xmath41 and require the state @xmath24 to be occupied , this condition leads to @xmath42 .",
    "the requirement that the final state with momentum @xmath43 should be empty gives @xmath44 provided @xmath45 ( see fig .",
    "[ perechod ] ) . if @xmath46 there is no additional restriction except @xmath42 , i.e. all occupied states are involved in transitions .",
    "[ perechod ]     to @xmath47 are involved in transitions .",
