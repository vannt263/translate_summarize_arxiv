    "since the discovery of superconductivity in metallic mgb@xmath1,@xcite abundant research has been carried out to elucidate its basic mechanism .",
    "mgb@xmath1 has some notable features which contrast with cuprate superconductors .",
    "first , electron coupling is mediated by phonons , as indicated by the observation of a prominent isotope effect.@xcite however , the transition temperature , @xmath10k , might be somewhat higher than the theoretical prediction assuming a conventional phonon mechanism.@xcite recently , it was suggested that anisotropy in electron - phonon couplings plays a significant role in the unusually high transition temperature.@xcite secondly , many theoretical@xcite and experimental works suggest that mgb@xmath1 has two separate gaps and that the symmetry of each gap is @xmath6-wave with a substantial gap anisotropy .",
    "the fermi surface of mgb@xmath1 consists of two nearly cylindrical ( 2d ) sheets and two tubular networks ( 3d).@xcite while the value of the gap associated with 3d sheets is in the range @xmath11 , for 2d networks the value is about @xmath12 .",
    "this double - gap structure and its anisotropic nature would be expected to play an important role in the physical properties of the compound .    in the early stages of mgb@xmath1 study ,",
    "a number of groups claimed unconventional superconductivity@xcite or @xmath6-wave order parameter symmetry@xcite from penetration depth measurements on various forms of samples .",
    "for example , prozorov _",
    "et al_.@xcite showed a clear exponential behavior of @xmath0 measured using a microwave technique for mgb@xmath1 wires . on the other hand , pronin _",
    "et al_.@xcite reported the penetration depth measurements of @xmath13-axis oriented films with @xmath14 k. they claimed that the penetration depth shows @xmath15 temperature dependence rather than exponential behavior at low temperatures , and suggested a strong gap anisotropy or the existence of nodes in the gap as its origin . at present , some of the results of penetration depth measurements and their interpretations are still controversial .    in this work ,",
    "we measure the magnetic penetration depth of a high - quality mgb@xmath1 film via a mutual - inductance technique . at low temperatures ,",
    "the superfluid density , @xmath16 , shows a clear exponential temperature dependence .",
    "however , the model assuming a single gap does not describe the experimental results .",
    "a full calculation within the bcs framework assuming existence of a double gap , successfully describes our data .",
    "the values of the two gaps obtained from fits to the data are consistent with previous reports . also , the contributions of each gap to the superfluid density are deduced from the analysis .",
    "initially , we compare the data with the low - temperature expansion formula for @xmath5 assuming one or two gaps to get a rough estimate of the gap values . then",
    ", we refine the values from a full calculation of the penetration depth . finally , we consider how the penetration depth is affected by gap anisotropy .",
    "the mgb@xmath17 thin film was fabricated using a two - step method ; the detailed process is described elsewhere.@xcite first , an amorphous boron thin film was deposited on a ( 1 @xmath18 0 2 ) al@xmath17o@xmath19 substrate of @xmath20 @xmath21 at room temperature by pulsed laser .",
    "then , the boron thin film was put into a nb tube with high purity mg metal ( 99.9% ) , and the nb tube was then sealed using an arc furnace in an ar atmosphere .",
    "finally , the heat treatment was carried out at 900@xmath22c for 10 to 30 minutes in an evacuated quartz ampoule , which was sealed under high vacuum .",
    "the film thickness is 0.3 @xmath23 m , confirmed by scanning electron microscopy .",
    "x - ray diffraction patterns indicated that the mgb@xmath17 thin film has a highly @xmath13-axis - oriented crystal structure normal to the substrate surface ; no impurity phase is observed .",
    "the penetration depth , @xmath0 , was measured using a two - coil mutual inductance technique described in detail elsewhere.@xcite the mgb@xmath1 film is centered between drive and pick - up coils with diameter of @xmath24 mm .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] schematically illustrates the measurement configuration . a current ( 1 ma@xmath25 30 ma ) at 50 khz in the drive coil induces screening currents in the film .",
    "the net magnetic field from the drive coil and the induced current in film are measured as a voltage across the pick - up coil . because the coils are much smaller than the film , the applied field",
    "is concentrated near the center of the film and demagnetizing effects at the film perimeter are not relevant .",
    "all data presented here are taken in the linear response regime .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows representative mutual inductance , @xmath26 , data measured with @xmath27 ma for @xmath28 k and @xmath29 ma for @xmath30 k. the mutual inductance technique enables us to extract absolute values as well as temperature dependence of the penetration depth from the mutual inductance data .",
    "the procedure to extract @xmath5 from @xmath26 is the following : first , a constant background ( zero position ) due to stray couplings between coils is subtracted from raw data .",
    "this constant background can be estimated from measuring at @xmath31 k the mutual inductance of pb foil with identical shape and area as substrate using the same measurement probe . in this background measurement ,",
    "the magnetic penetration depth of pb is so small compared to foil thickness that no magnetic field goes through film .",
    "after the subtraction of the background , the data is normalized to the value of mutual inductance at @xmath32 k ( initial position ) .",
    "the normalization removes uncertainties associated with amplifier gains and nonideal aspects of the coil windings .",
    "the subtracted and normalized mutual inductance is converted to complex conductivity , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are real and imaginary parts of the conductivity .",
    "finally , the penetration depth is determined from the imaginary part of conductivity via the relationship @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the magnetic permeability of vacuum and @xmath38 is the frequency of drive current .",
    "the accuracy of @xmath39 is limited by 10% uncertainty in film thickness . however , the temperature dependence of @xmath39 is unaffected by the uncertainty .",
    "the other inset of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] displays @xmath5 curves deduced from @xmath26 measured at two different @xmath40 levels .",
    "although the signal - to - noise ratio of upper curve ( @xmath41 ma for @xmath42 25 k ) is smaller than that of lower one ( @xmath43 ma for @xmath42 25 k ) , two curves do not show any quantitative difference .",
    "( upper curve was shifted by 10 @xmath44m@xmath45 for comparison . )",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows @xmath5 at temperatures below 15 k. the value of @xmath5 at @xmath46 k is about 43 @xmath44m@xmath45 , which corresponds to @xmath47 nm . to examine the temperature dependence of @xmath5 at low temperatures ,",
    "we fit first @xmath48% drop in @xmath5 to an exponential - type function @xmath49 , where @xmath13 are @xmath50 are adjustable parameters .",
    "as presented by thin solid line in the figure , the fit is reasonably good . on the other hand , when we fit the data in the same temperature region to a quadratic form @xmath51 as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the fit deviates significantly from the data ( dashed line in the same figure ) .",
    "the @xmath52 values for exponential and quadratic fits are @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "the exponential @xmath55-dependence of @xmath5 at low temperatures can be regarded to reflect @xmath6-wave order - parameter symmetry in this compound . for clean bcs - type superconductors@xcite ,",
    "@xmath5 is given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the superconducting energy gap , @xmath58^{-1}$ ] is the fermi distribution function , and @xmath59 , is the quasiparticle density of states ( dos ) .",
    "this equation can be expanded at low temperatures , where @xmath57 is nearly constant , in the following way@xcite : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the energy gap at zero temperature .",
    "thin solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] represents eq.([eq1 ] ) fitted to data .",
    "the comparison between data and theory is restricted to the first @xmath48% drop in @xmath5 , where the @xmath55-dependence of @xmath57 is not significant .",
    "this comparison yields @xmath62 mev @xmath63 $ ] and @xmath64 @xmath44m@xmath45 .",
    "the gap value is significantly smaller than the bcs weak coupling limit @xmath65 . using the gap value deduced above , @xmath5 in the whole temperature region below @xmath66",
    "can be obtained by a full bcs calculation using eq .",
    "( [ bcsfull ] ) .",
    "if the above one - gap fit is valid , the full calculation is expected to describe the experimental @xmath5 for the entire temperature region below @xmath66 .",
    "thin solid line in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] represents this full calculation",
    ". the curve does not give a correct description of the data at high temperatures .",
    "while the data show negative curvature at high temperatures , the theoretical line shows weakly positive curvature .",
    "a number of experimental and theoretical groups have proposed the existence of two gaps in the dos of mgb@xmath1 .",
    "the larger gap belongs to the quasi-2d fermi surface derived from b - b ( @xmath67 ) bonds , and the smaller gap belongs to the quasi-3d fermi surface derived from b - mg - b ( @xmath68 ) bonds .",
    "we model this two - gap nature by writing @xmath69 as a sum of two bcs dos .",
    "thus , low - temperature expansion of @xmath5 can be expressed by @xmath70 \\\\      & ~&+      \\lambda_l^{-2}(0)\\bigg[1-\\bigg(\\frac{2\\pi\\delta_l(0)}{k_bt}\\bigg)^{1/2 }       \\exp(-\\delta_l(0)/k_bt )      \\bigg ] ,      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath71 [ @xmath72 and @xmath73 [ @xmath74 are the value of the small ( large ) gap and the contribution of small ( large ) gap to total superfluid density ( @xmath75 ) , respectively .",
    "for comparison with data , it is more convenient to convert the above equation to the following form @xmath76 where @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 .    at very low temperatures ,",
    "the change of superfluid density with temperature , i.e. , the quasiparticle excitation , is dominated by the small gap . in other words ,",
    "the role of the large gap in @xmath5 is relevant at higher temperatures .",
    "thus , we extend the fitting region up to @xmath80% drop in @xmath5 . 15% drop in @xmath5 corresponds to about 10% drop in @xmath81 in the bcs weak coupling limit . accordingly , in this fit about 10% error due to change of @xmath57 can be expected . figure  [ fig4 ] shows the comparison of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) with data . from this fit , we obtains two distinct gap values , @xmath82 mev and @xmath83 mev , corresponding to @xmath84 and @xmath85 . in the case of the small gap ,",
    "the value is consistent with previous reports .",
    "but the large gap value is somewhat smaller than those in the literatures ( table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "the success of the fit motivates a full calculation in the extended temperature range for a more precise description of the data .",

    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows our attempt to fit the data using eq.([eq3 ] ) . except near @xmath66",
    ", the theoretical line gives a good fit to the data . from this",
    ", we obtain the gap values @xmath7 mev and @xmath8 mev .",
    "these are fairly consistent with previous reports ( table i ) . also ,",

    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows theoretical @xmath5 curves , where the contributions of each gap are separately plotted .    in the above analysis",
    ", we described the @xmath5 theoretically assuming the gaps ( @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) being isotropic on the fermi surfaces . according to a recent theoretical calculation ,",
    "the values of the small and large gaps are distributed in the range of 1 mev @xmath92 mev and 6.5 mev @xmath93 on the fermi surfaces.@xcite here we suppose two phenomenological models for gap distribution . in the first model , the gap is distributed uniformly around the average value of gap , @xmath94 . in the alternative model , we assume the normal ( gaussian ) distribution of the gap . using these models , we calculate theoretical curves of @xmath5 assuming @xmath95% variation of gap around @xmath94 on the fermi surface .",
    "the gap distribution of @xmath96% is sufficient to account for real gap anisotropy in mgb@xmath1.@xcite the calculations reveal that the change in @xmath5 due to the gap distribution is not significant .",
    "in fact , the maximum change in @xmath39 due to the gap anisotropy is only about 2% in the case of the uniform distribution .",
    "the normal gap distribution causes negligibly small change in @xmath39 .",
    "these results lead us to the conclusion that the gap anisotropy on the fermi surface of mgb@xmath1 is not relevant in determining the temperature dependence of the penetration depth .",
