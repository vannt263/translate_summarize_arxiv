    "the same electrons that radiate synchrotron photons would scatter these synchrotron seed photons to high energies , forming a distinct spectral component .",
    "the ssc mechanism has been invoked to account for the observed high energy emission in many astrophysical sources , such as gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "ssc is a complex process .",
    "the flux at each observed frequency includes the contributions from electrons in a wide range of energies , which scatter seed photons in a wide range of frequencies .",
    "therefore , a precise description of the ssc spectrum invokes a complex convolution of the seed photon spectrum and electron energy distribution , which requires numerical calculations .",
    "however , for a synchrotron source with shock - accelerated electrons , the injected electron spectrum is usually assumed to be a simple power - law function , the corresponding electron energy distribution and seed synchrotron spectrum thus have simple patterns . some analytical approximations for the ssc spectrum",
    "can be then made if compton scattering is in the thomson regime .",
    "besides the injected electron spectrum , two other factors are essential to define the shape of the final electron energy distribution in a synchrotron source : radiation cooling and self - absorption heating .",
    "there are three characteristic synchrotron frequencies in the spectrum : the minimum injection frequency ( @xmath9 ) , the cooling frequency ( @xmath10 ) , and the self - absorption frequency ( @xmath0 ) . when @xmath11 , the heating effect due to self - absorption is not important in modifying the electron energy spectrum . for a continuous injection of a power - law electron spectrum ,",
    "the final electron energy distribution is a broken power law .",
    "the seed synchrotron spectrum for ssc is characterized by a multi - segment broken power law , separated by @xmath12 , @xmath10 , and @xmath13 .",
    "different ordering of the three characteristic frequencies leads to different shapes of the seed synchrotron spectrum . in the literature ,",
    "usually @xmath14 is assumed .",
    "@xcite have derived the approximated expressions of the ssc spectrum in the @xmath15 and @xmath16 regimes , respectively .    when @xmath17 , synchrotron self - absorption becomes an important heating source for the low - energy electrons .",
    "consequently , the electrons are dominated by a quasi - thermal component until a `` transition '' lorentz factor @xmath18 , above which the electrons are no longer affected by the self - absorption heating and keep the normal power law distribution @xcite . for these strong absorption cases , a thermal peak due to",
    "pile - up electrons would appear around @xmath0 in the synchrotron spectrum @xcite , which would also result in some new features in the ssc spectrum .    in this paper , we extend the analysis of @xcite and present the full analytical approximated expressions of the ssc spectrum in all six possible cases of @xmath0 , @xmath9 , @xmath2 ordering . in section 2 , three weak synchrotron self - absorption cases ( @xmath19 ) are discussed . in section 3 ,",
    "we focus on the strong synchrotron self - absorption regime ( @xmath17 ) , where synchrotron self - absorption significantly affects the electron energy distribution . by adopting a simplified prescription of the pile - up electron distribution",
    ", we derive the expressions of both synchrotron and ssc spectral components .",
    "all the expressions in this work are valid in the thomson regime , so that the klein - nishina correction effect ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is not important in the first order ssc component .",
    "we also limit our treatment to the first - order ssc , and assume that the higher - order ssc components ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are suppressed by the klein - nishina effect . such an assumption is usually valid for most problems . in order to make a simple analytical treatment ,",
    "we have applied a simplified approximation for the synchrotron spectra , and adopted the simplification that the inverse compton scattering of mono - energetic electrons off mono - energetic seed photons is also mono - energetic @xcite .",
    "this would not significantly deteriorate precision of the analysis , while making it much simpler .",
    "in the single scattering regime , the inverse compton volume emissivity for a power - law distribution of electrons is @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 ( an angle - dependent parameter ) , @xmath22 is the incident specific flux in the shock front , @xmath23 is thomson scattering cross section , and @xmath24 takes care of the angular dependence of the scattering cross section in the limit of @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "one can approximate @xmath26 for @xmath27 to simplify the integration , which would yield a correct behavior for @xmath28 ( sari & esin 2001 ) .",
    "with such a simplification , the ssc spectrum is given by ( sari & esin 2001 ) , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the synchrotron flux , @xmath31 is the co - moving size of the emission region , and the value of the parameter @xmath32 is set by ensuring energy conservation , i.e. @xmath33 .    when @xmath19 , in the slow cooling regime ( @xmath34 ) , the electron energy distribution is @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the minimum lorentz factor of the injected electrons , and @xmath37 is electron spectral index .",
    "cooling is efficient for electrons with lorentz factor above the critical value @xmath38 .",
    "notice that eq.[ngam1 ] is only valid for @xmath39 .    in the fast cooling regime ( @xmath40 ) , the electron energy distribution is @xmath41 in this regime , all the injected electrons are able to cool on the dynamical timescale .",
    "therefore , there is a population of electrons with lorentz factor below the injection minimum lorentz factor @xmath36 .    the seed synchrotron spectrum @xmath42 has spectral beaks at @xmath0 , @xmath9 and @xmath2 , where @xmath0 is the self - absorption frequency , below which the system becomes optically thick , and @xmath9 and @xmath2 are the characteristic synchrotron frequencies for the electrons with lorentz factors @xmath36 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the critical frequencies in the ssc component are defined by different combination of @xmath43 and @xmath44 . for convenience",
    ", we use a new notation in this paper @xmath45 the physical meaning is the characteristic upscattered frequency for mono - energetic electrons with lorentz factor @xmath46 scattering off mono - energetic photons with frequency @xmath47 .      this case has been studied by @xcite .",
    "the synchrotron spectrum reads for simple presentation .",

    "by applying the einstein coefficients and their relations to a system with three energy levels , @xcite have derived one useful analytical expression of the cross section for synchrotron self - absorption : @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the relevant electron lorentz factor , @xmath53 is photon frequency being absorbed , @xmath153 is the fine structure constant , @xmath154 is the critical magnetic field strength , @xmath155 is the classical electron radius , and @xmath156 is the electron cyclotron frequency .",
    "all the parameters introduced in this section are in the comoving frame .      for electrons with lorenz factor @xmath152 , the heating rate",
    "due to synchrotron self - absorption can be estimated as @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the specific photon number density at frequency @xmath53 contributed by all the electrons .      by balancing the heating and cooing rate ,",
    "one can easily obtain the critical electron lorentz factor @xmath162 , which satisfies @xmath163 initially , the photon spectrum has not been revised through self - absorption , i.e. , @xmath164 .",
    "one therefore has @xmath165    the electron pile - up ( strong absorption ) condition can be expressed as @xmath166 with equations [ crosection ] - [ cri ] , the pile - up condition can be expressed as @xmath167 where @xmath168 is the synchrotron peak flux in the emission region . here",
    "@xmath169 is the luminosity distance of the source , and @xmath31 is the distance of the emission region from the central engine .",
    "one can immediately see that this condition is very difficult to satisfy .",
    "it requires a strong magnetic field , long dynamical time scale and high synchrotron flux . in the grb",
    "afterglow problem , for forward shock emission , @xmath170 decreases with @xmath171 rapidly , and there is essentially no parameter space to satisfy the condition . this condition may be realized in extreme conditions , e.g. the reverse shock emission during shock crossing phase for a wind medium , as discussed in sect.4 in the main text .",
    "one interesting note is that ssc cooling only enhances the pile - up condition .",
    "once the pile - up condition is satisfied for synchrotron cooling only , adding ssc cooling only makes the condition more easily satisfied ( as shown in equation [ criterion ] ) .",
    "once the electron pile - up process is triggered , both electron distribution and photon spectrum would be modified , so that the value of @xmath162 is modified correspondingly . according to the numerical calculation results @xcite",
    ", the electron distribution is dominated by a quasi - thermal component until a `` transition '' lorentz factor @xmath18 , above which the electrons go back to the optically - thin normal power law . in this case",
    ", @xmath162 should be around the thermal peak , and @xmath172 should be around the `` transition '' lorentz factor @xmath18 , which is slightly larger than @xmath162 .",
    "consequently , one would roughly have @xmath173 , so that the assumption of a sharp cutoff in the electron distribution around this energy is justified . in the main text",
    ", we did not differentiate the three lorentz factors , and only adopt @xmath172 in the expressions ."
