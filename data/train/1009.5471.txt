    "the reionization of neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) was a landmark event in cosmic history , rendering the universe transparent to uv photons and dramatically reducing the star formation efficiency in dwarf galaxies . in spite of its importance , there are few robust constraints on when reionization occurred . polarization measures of the microwave background radiation @xcite",

    "absorption line spectra of high-@xmath10 quasars are largely sensitive to the very late stages ( @xmath11 ) of reionization @xcite , and progress has been slow due to the paucity of sources so far detected beyond @xmath12 .",
    "one of the most promising probes of reionization with current facilities is through the study of ly@xmath0 emission from star forming galaxies .",
    "since ly@xmath0 photons are resonantly scattered by neutral hydrogen , the abundance of ly@xmath0 emitters should decrease as observations probe into the era where there are pockets of neutral gas .",
    "studies of the redshift - dependent luminosity function ( lf ) of ly@xmath0 emitters ( laes ) selected via narrowband filters have revealed a possible decline in abundance between @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( @xcite ) , offering tantalizing evidence that this short time interval ( @xmath15200 myr ) may correspond to one during which there is some evolution in the neutral fraction .",
    "but since a number of astrophysical factors can also affect the presence of ly@xmath0 emission , it may be dangerous to directly link evolution in the ly@xmath0 lf to reionization ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these factors include time - dependent changes in the host galaxy number density , dust obscuration and interstellar gas content and kinematic properties . by enlarging the lae samples",
    ", it may be possible to bypass some of these complications by testing for the expected change in their spatial clustering and line profiles as the neutral era is entered @xcite .",
    "a complementary approach introduced in @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) is to spectroscopically measure the fraction of strong ly@xmath0 emitters within the _ color - selected lyman break galaxy ( lbg ) population_. by tracing the redshift - dependent fraction , the host galaxy number density is not a factor .",
    "evolution in dust obscuration can be independently tracked using the continuum colors and ism kinematics through deep spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "although demanding observationally , high throughput spectrographs such as fors2 on the eso very large telescope and deimos on the keck ii telescope have enabled progress in recent years ( paper i , @xcite ) . with the additional information on the host galaxies possible for the lbg population , we can hope to more reliably link any redshift - dependence in the ly@xmath0 fraction to ionization changes in the igm .",
    "most importantly of all , the proposed approach can now be readily extended to @xmath16 - 8 and beyond given the availability of lbg samples at these early epochs following the advent of the wfc3/ir camera onboard hubble space telescope ( hst , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in paper i we introduced a large keck spectroscopic survey of @xmath17 lbgs and demonstrated the practical details of the above method through analyses of the ly@xmath0 fraction ( @xmath18 ) in b - band ( @xmath6 ) and v - band ( @xmath19 ) dropouts to which we added a sample of @xmath20-band ( @xmath2 ) dropouts drawn from other programs ( e.g. , @xcite , bunker et al .",
    "2010 , in prep ) . correcting for minor magnitude and redshift - dependent biases in completeness and contamination , we determined the luminosity and redshift dependence of @xmath18 over @xmath1 .",
    "since the igm is known to be highly ionized over this interval , this dataset enabled us to explore the importance of factors other than the igm neutral fraction .",
    "we found that galaxies with lower rest - frame uv continuum luminosities exhibit ly@xmath0 emission more frequently than luminous systems .",
    "correlations between line strength and uv continuum slope suggest reduced dust obscuration is the primary cause .",
    "the data also suggest an increase in @xmath18 with redshift ( dx@xmath21 ) , as originally claimed based on the relative evolution of the uv luminosity function of laes and lbgs over this redshift range @xcite . however , since the size of our archival @xmath2 samples were considerably smaller than that of our lower redshift database , the constraints on the redshift evolution were primarily derived from data spanning only the 300 myr between @xmath6 and @xmath19 .",
    "ideally one would construct the full equivalent width ( ew ) distribution function of ly@xmath0 emission for a range of uv luminosities at the highest redshift where the igm is known to be highly ionized , i.e. @xmath2 .",
    "this could then form the basis for comparisons with spectroscopic data at @xmath22 where reionization may be incomplete . with this motivation",
    ", we have thus extended the sample introduced in paper i , through ultra - deep spectroscopy of a sample of @xmath20-band dropouts in the goods north field .",

    "the completeness is of course lower on the deimos mask observed for only 3.67 hours , reaching below @xmath51% for faint sources with w@xmath49   , and we therefore do not include these sources when computing the fraction of lbgs with low ew ly@xmath0 emission .",
    "an additional concern is that the color - cut and @xmath10-band selection of @xmath20-band dropouts are affected by ly@xmath0 emission and ly@xmath0 forest absorption .",
    "we investigate the extent to which these effects transform the observed ew distribution using monte carlo simulations .",
    "we create a large sample ( @xmath4710@xmath52 ) of artificial galaxies with intrinsic absolute magnitudes ( normalized at 1500   ) spanning @xmath53 and redshifts spanning @xmath54 .",
    "the intrinsic luminosity distribution of the fake galaxies matches the observed @xmath20-drop luminosity function ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for the spectral shape , we use synthetic templates ( charlot & bruzual 2010 , in preparation ) with parameters fixed to those which provide reasonable fits for similarly bright @xmath20-dropouts ( e.g. @xcite ) . changing these parameters to other reasonable values",
    "does not affect our results .",
    "we attach ly@xmath0 luminosities to each of the galaxies according to an assumed ly@xmath0 ew distribution ( which we describe below ) and we also account for ly@xmath0 forest absorption using the relations presented in @xcite .",
    "finally we derive @xmath55 and @xmath56-band magnitudes from the model seds and construct an artificial sample of @xmath20-drops which satisfy the color criteria and @xmath10-band magnitude limit .",
    "we find that the output ew distribution matches the input ew distribution of galaxies at the mean redshift of the @xmath20-drop population .",
    "for example , if we adopt an input ew distribution with the form @xmath57= exp[-@xmath58/@xmath59 and set @xmath60=20.0   , we find that the output ew distribution is nearly identical to the input distribution ( @xmath60=20.1   ) .",
    "it should be noted that poisson noise ( which tends to scatter faint sources toward slightly brighter magnitudes ) will alter the ew distribution if the intrinsic ew distribution is luminosity - dependent , as suggested by paper i. but this effect should occur at each redshift and hence should not affect the measured redshift evolution in the ew distribution .",
    "we now derive the ew distribution and ly@xmath0 fraction ( @xmath18 ) for @xmath2 galaxies and compare with the lower redshift samples of paper i. we group our @xmath20-drop sample into two bins of rest - uv absolute magnitude , taking care to apply minor corrections to the observed broadband magnitudes to compensate for the effects of ly@xmath0 emission and igm ly@xmath0 forest absorption . for galaxies without ly@xmath0 emission ,",
    "we correct for ly@xmath0 forest absorption statistically using the redshift distribution predicted from the monte carlo simulations in  3 .    in figure 2",
    ", we present our observed ly@xmath0 ew distribution , with emission lines grouped in 30     bins . for the luminous sub - sample , the distribution , p(@xmath58 ) , rises toward lower ew widths , reaching p=@xmath61% in the lowest ew bin considered . when compared to the ew distribution of luminous sources at @xmath62 ( from paper i ) , we find that while ly@xmath0 is marginally more common in each ew bin at @xmath2 , the uncertainties are too large to distinguish the two distributions . in contrast , in the lower luminosity bin",
    ", the ew distribution shows stronger positive evolution from @xmath62 , with ly@xmath0 considerably more prevalent among @xmath2 lbgs .",
    "we next compute the lbg ly@xmath0 fraction by integrating the ew distribution above 25     and 55     to yield the fractions x@xmath63 and x@xmath64 .",
    "we group galaxies in the same two luminosity bins as in the analysis above . in the faint subset ,",
    "we find @xmath3% have w@xmath65     and @xmath66% have w@xmath67   .",
    "luminous galaxies exhibit ly@xmath0 emission less frequently , with @xmath68% and @xmath69% observed with ly@xmath0 emission in excess of 25 and 55   . combining our results with those from paper i",
    ", we find that the fraction of ly@xmath0 emitters among the lbg population increases with redshift for lower luminosity galaxies . assuming a linear relationship between x@xmath70 and redshift , we find dx@xmath63/dz = @xmath71 .",
    "in contrast , less redshift evolution is seen in the larger ew bin ( dx@xmath64/dz = @xmath72 ) , consistent with the findings from paper i. similar ( albeit noisier ) trends are seen in the more luminous sub - sample , with the lowest ew bin showing the strongest indications of positive evolution with redshift .",
    "this improved determination of the ew distribution and ly@xmath0 fraction for lbgs at @xmath2 is a necessary step toward providing the essential baseline for predicting the outcome of spectroscopic campaigns beyond @xmath16 and interpreting any downturn in the ly@xmath0 fraction that may be associated with reionization ( see  5 ) .",

    ", scaledwidth=49.0% ]",
    "our new results , taken together with those in paper i , now suggest that @xmath76% of moderately faint ( @xmath77 ) @xmath2 lbgs exhibit very strong ly@xmath0 emission . in paper",
    "i , we argued that both the redshift and luminosity dependence of the ly@xmath0 fraction was likely due in large part to variations in dust obscuration as evidenced by the correlation between ly@xmath0 ew and the rest - frame uv slope , @xmath78 .",
    "recent analyses of the colors of the @xmath16 lbgs indicate that these systems are yet bluer than those at @xmath2 @xcite , implying even less or no dust obscuration .",
    "hence it seems likely that the redshift trend in the ly@xmath0 fraction presented in figure [ fig : lya_frac ] should continue to @xmath16 and that ly@xmath0 should be readily detectable in sufficiently deep spectroscopic campaigns .",
    "given the short cosmic time spanning @xmath79 ( @xmath80 myr ) , it seems plausible to use the ew distribution and ly@xmath0 fractions presented in figure  [ fig : lya_frac ] to predict the expected ly@xmath0 visibility for sources at @xmath16 , assuming ly@xmath0 flux is not significantly attenuated by neutral hydrogen in the igm .",
    "motivated by the blue @xmath16 uv slopes discussed above , we extrapolate the evolution in x@xmath70 to @xmath16 ( figure 2 ) . for low luminosity sources , this results in a small increase in the ly@xmath0 fraction ( @xmath81 ) which we divide into the three ew bins using weights set by @xmath82 .",
    "we follow the same procedure for the luminous sources .",
    "the results , presented in figure 3 , suggest a survey of @xmath83 - 30 galaxies drawn from the now - available wfc3/ir target list ( e.g. , @xcite ) would yield interesting results .",
    "while uncertainty in the observed ly@xmath0 trends and their extrapolation to @xmath16 obviously affects our prediction , it seems clear that ly@xmath0 should be common in @xmath16 samples if the igm is highly ionized .",
    "the failure to detect emission in such a sample might therefore be a strong indicator of a rising neutral fraction beyond @xmath2 as claimed originally by @xcite from the luminosity function of laes .",
    "how practical is a search for line emission to the ew limit of 20     discussed above ? in terms of an integrated line flux @xmath84 , the ew limit corresponds to @xmath8510@xmath40 erg @xmath41 s@xmath35 for @xmath16 galaxies with m@xmath86=-20(-21 ) ( corresponding to galaxies with apparent ab magnitudes of @xmath87 and 26 , respectively ) .",
    "such line flux limits are feasible with spectrographs on 8 - 10 meter telescopes such as the near infrared spectrograph ( nirspec ) on keck ii @xcite .",
    "earlier work with nirspec has reached such a limit at 5-@xmath37 significance between the atmospheric sky lines in the @xmath88 and @xmath89-band in @xmath75 hours @xcite .",
    "as more multi - object infrared spectrographs become available , it will be feasible to observe many @xmath22 sources simultaneously , allowing ultra - deep exposures of galaxies at least as faint as @xmath90  -19 .",
    "we present new ultra - deep spectroscopic observations of 30 @xmath20-band dropouts in goods - n using deimos on the keck ii telescope . by adding these spectra to the large database of deimos and fors2 spectra of b , v , and @xmath20-band dropouts discussed in paper i , we demonstrate more robustly the rise with redshift over @xmath91 in the fraction of low luminosity lbgs that show prominent ly@xmath0 emission . we also derive a much - improved ew distribution of ly@xmath0 at @xmath2 , the highest redshift where the intergalactic medium is known to be highly ionized . motivated by the continued blueward evolution of the continuum uv slopes to @xmath16 , we extrapolate the ly@xmath0 fraction trends presented in this paper to redshift 7 , and predict the likely success rate of recovering ly@xmath0 emission in the new population of @xmath22 sources located with hst .",
    "our results suggest line emission should be readily detected given adequate observing time and that quantitative results would therefore test for the presence of neutral gas associated with the end of cosmic reionization near @xmath16 .",
