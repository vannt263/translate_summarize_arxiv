    "this is the well - known casimir effect ( for a review see @xcite ) . in a previous paper @xcite ,",
    "we have studied the configuration with both types of sources for the polarization of the scalar vacuum , namely , a cylindrical boundary and a cosmic string , assuming that the boundary is coaxial with the string and that on this surface the scalar field obeys robin boundary condition . for a massive scalar field with an arbitrary curvature coupling parameter we evaluated the wightman function and the vacuum expectation values of the field square and the energy - momentum tensor .",

    "in addition to describing the physical structure of the quantum field at a given point , the energy - momentum tensor acts as a source of gravity in the einstein equations .",

    "all calculations can be performed in a closed form and it constitutes an example in which the gravitational and boundary - induced polarizations of the vacuum can be separated in different contributions .",

    "a realistic cosmic string has a structure on a length scale defined by the phase transition at which it is formed . as it has been shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , the internal structure of the string may have non - negligible effects even at large distances . here",
    "we note that when the cylindrical boundary is present , the vevs of the physical quantities in the exterior region are uniquely defined by the boundary conditions and the bulk geometry .",
    "this means that if we consider a non - trivial core model with finite thickness @xmath151 and with the line element ( [ ds21 ] ) in the region @xmath152 , the results in the region outside the cylindrical shell will not be changed .",
    "as regards to the interior region , the formulae given above are the first stage of the evaluation of the vevs and other effects could be present in a realistic cosmic string .",
    "note that from the point of view of the physics in the exterior region the conducting cylindrical surface can be considered as a simple model of superconducting string core .",
    "superconducting strings are predicted in a wide class of field theories and they are sources of a number of interesting astrophysical effects such as generation of synchrotron radiation , cosmic rays , and relativistic jets .",
