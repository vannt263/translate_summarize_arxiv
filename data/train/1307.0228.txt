    "spin - dependent electrons transport in low - dimensional mesoscopic systems has recently drawn much attention due to its potential for future electronic device applications in the field of spintronics @xcite .",
    "this new emerging field deals with the active manipulation of the electron s spin ( and not only its charge ) . adding the spin degree of freedom to the conventional charge - based technology has the potential advantages of multifunctionality , longer decoherence times and lengths , increased data processing speed , decreased electric power consumption , and increased integration densities compared with conventional semiconductor devices @xcite .",
    "in addition to the improvement of contemporary technology , spintronics may also contribute to the field of quantum computation and quantum information , in which the quantum information may be contained in the unit vector along which the spin is polarized .",
    "writing and reading information on a spin qubit are thus equivalent to polarizing the spin along a specific direction and identifying the direction along which the spin is polarized , respectively .",
    "hence , a major aim of spintronics is to build mesoscopic spin valves ( or spin filters ) , which generate a tunable spin - polarized current out of unpolarized electron sources .",
    "spin filters can also be used as spin analyzers , which read this information by identifying the polarization directions of incoming polarized beams . a priori , a straightforward way to realize such devices is by using ferromagnets that inject and/or collect polarized electrons @xcite . however , connecting ferromagnets to semiconductors is inefficient , due to a large impedance mismatch between them @xcite .",
    "therefore , efforts are being made to model and fabricate spintronic devices using intrinsic properties of mesoscopic systems such as strong spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) .",
    "this paradigm of spintronics involves small fields without the need for ferromagnetism at all @xcite .    in a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) , formed in mesoscopic structures made of narrow - gap semiconductor heterostructures ,",
    "the soi has the general form @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "here @xmath1 characterizes the soi strength , @xmath2 is a linear combination of the electron momentum components @xmath3 and @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the effective mass .",
    "the vector of pauli matrices @xmath6 is related to the electron spin via @xmath7 .",
    "we distinguish between two special cases of the linear ( in the momentum ) soi , namely the rashba soi @xcite and the dresselhaus soi @xcite .",
    "the rashba soi is present in narrow - gap semiconductor heterostructures with a confining potential well which is asymmetric under space inversion . for an electric field perpendicular to the interferometer plane ( defined as the @xmath8 axis ) ,",
    "this soi has the form @xmath9 the coefficient @xmath10 depends on the magnitude of the electric field and can be controlled by a gate voltage , as shown in several experiments @xcite .",
    "the dresselhaus soi is a consequence of a host crystal which lacks bulk inversion symmetry . for a 2deg",
    "the linear dresselhaus soi is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a material constant which is proportional to @xmath13 , with @xmath14 the quantum well thickness @xcite .",
    "it depends weakly ( if at all ) on the external field .",
    "these sois can be interpreted as a zeeman interaction in a momentum - dependent effective magnetic field . as the electron propagates in the presence of these sois , its spin precesses around this effective magnetic field . as a consequence , after propagating a distance @xmath15 in the direction of the unit vector @xmath16 , the electron s spinor @xmath17 transforms into @xmath18 with the su(2 ) matrix @xmath19 @xcite . here , the vector @xmath20 is @xmath21 with the dimensionless coefficients @xmath22 .",
    "the soi - related phase of the unitary matrix @xmath23 is known as the aharonov - casher ( ac ) phase @xcite .",
    "below we use the unitary matrix @xmath23 and the parameters @xmath24 to characterize the hopping between adjacent bonds in the presence of soi .    recently , several groups proposed spin filters based on a single loop , subject to both electric and magnetic fields perpendicular to the plane of the loop @xcite",
    ". the phases of these waves include the ac phase and the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) phase @xcite , which results from a magnetic flux @xmath25 penetrating the loop .",
    "when an electron goes around such a loop , its wave function gains an ab phase @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the flux quantum ( @xmath28 is the speed of light and @xmath29 is the electron charge ) .",
    "the combined effect of the soi and the ab flux is to transform the spinor @xmath17 of an electron that goes around a loop into @xmath30 , where the unitary matrix @xmath31 is of the form @xmath32 here @xmath33 ( @xmath34 is the @xmath35 unit matrix ) is the diagonal transformation matrix due to the ab flux and @xmath36 is the transformation matrix due to the soi .",
    "the latter is a product of matrices of the form @xmath37 discussed above , each coming from the local soi on a segment of the loop @xcite .",
    "we neglect the zeeman term @xmath38 ( @xmath39 is the land factor and @xmath40 is the bohr magneton ) .",
    "even though @xmath39 can be large in low - dimensional systems , the zeeman term is much smaller than the soi terms ( [ rashba hamiltonian ] ) and ( [ dresselhaus hamiltonian ] ) in the magnetic fields considered .    in a previous paper we proposed a diamond interferometer which combines the ab and ac phases to filter a specific spin direction @xcite .",
    "the filtered direction can be tuned by the external electric and magnetic fields . moreover ,",
    "the transmission of the outgoing spin - polarized electrons can be tuned to unity in a wide range of energies .",
    "recently , we generalized this interferometer by including a possible leakage of electrons out of the interferometer @xcite .",
    "we have shown that spin filtering is still possible in a non - unitary transport , even though the transmission is inherently less than unity .",
    "a major advantage of the diamond interferometer is that full spin filtering can be achieved independent of the electron energy .",
    "however , the conditions for full spin filtering , independent of the electron energy , require perfect symmetry between the two branches of the interferometer @xcite .",
    "having fulfilled these symmetry relations , the polarization of the outgoing electrons is independent of energy and completely determined by the ab and ac phases @xcite ( and therefore by the external electric and magnetic fields perpendicular to the interferometer plane ) .",
    "unfortunately , realizing a highly symmetric interferometer in experiments may be a difficult task .",
    "it is thus desirable to have a perfect spin filtering , independent of the electron energy , in an asymmetric interferometer . as we argue in this paper ,",
    "this can be achieved by enlarging the number of interferometer parameters ( such as hopping and site energies ) .",
    "below we examine a double - dot interferometer which allows a wide freedom for the various parameters , thereby simplifies the experimental realization .",
    "the relations between the various parameters are further simplified if one assumes linear - response regime ( namely , low temperatures and bias voltages ) , in which electron transport occurs at a single energy .    the double - dot interferometer is sketched schematically in figure [ fig : square interferometer1 ] .",
    "it consists of two elongated quantum dots ( qds ) or quantum nanowires ( qns ) which are subject to soi , and the area of the interferometer is penetrated by an ab flux .",
    "recently , the electrical control of soi was demonstrated in such inas self - assembled elongated qds and nanowires @xcite .",
    "the wires which connect the qds / qns are free of soi .",
    "using scattering theory in the framework of the tight - binding formalism , we calculate the spin - dependent transmission through this interferometer .",
    "we employ a one - dimensional tight - binding model , assuming that the interferometer is composed of quasi one - dimensional wires @xcite .",
    "the double - dot interferometer .",
    "the interferometer is penetrated by a magnetic flux @xmath25 , and its horizontal edges ( of length @xmath15 , shown by the dark ellipses in the figure ) are subject to spin - orbit interactions .",
    "the @xmath41 and @xmath42 axes are parallel to the crystallographic @xmath43 and @xmath44 axes.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec 1 ] we first define the tight - binding model which we use to study electron transport in the double - dot interferometer and solve for the transmission of an arbitrary interferometer ( sec . [",
    "sec 1a ] ) .",
    "then we find the general conditions for full filtering ( sec .",
    "[ sec 1b ] ) . finally , we find specific criteria for spin filtering in the presence of rashba and dresselhaus sois ( sec .",
    "[ sec 1c ] ) .",
    "the results are discussed and summarized in sec .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "to study the scattering of a spin-1/2 electron by the double - dot interferometer with arbitrary soi and ab flux ( figure [ fig : square interferometer1 ] ) , we model it as a square interferometer as shown in figure [ fig : square interferometer2 ] .",
    "each qd / qn is replaced by a bond connecting two sites ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath28 , @xmath14 in figure [ fig : square interferometer2 ] ) with the corresponding bonds subject to soi .",
    "we emphasize that the solution is not limited to this model .",
    "one can model each qd / qn by an arbitrary number of sites @xmath47 .",
    "this changes only the transmission of the spin - polarized electrons , with no significant effect on the spin filtering conditions and the polarization direction of the outgoing electrons @xcite .",
    "tight - binding model of the double - dot interferometer .",
    "the bonds @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( of length @xmath15 ) are subject to spin - orbit interactions.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in the framework of the nearest neighbors tight - binding model , the schrdinger equation for the spinor @xmath50 at site @xmath51 is written as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the site energy , @xmath54 is a real hopping amplitude and @xmath55 is a @xmath56 unitary matrix which describes the ab and ac phases acquired by an electron moving from site @xmath31 to site @xmath51 .",
    "the sum in equation ( [ tight binding ] ) is over the nearest neighbors @xmath31 of @xmath51 . at this stage",
    "we do not specify the details of these matrices and hopping amplitudes . except for the sites",
    "@xmath57 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath28 , @xmath14 and @xmath58 ( figure [ fig : square interferometer2 ] ) , the hopping amplitude along the leads is @xmath59 and the site energies on the leads are set to zero .",
    "the leads are free of soi .",
    "thus , the dispersion relation of the leads is @xmath60 with @xmath45 the lattice constant . the tight - binding schrdinger equations for the spinors at sites @xmath57 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath28 , @xmath14 and @xmath58 are @xmath61 eliminating @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 from equations ( [ tb ] ) one ends up with the equations @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 here , the coefficients @xmath69 and @xmath70 are defined as @xmath71 and @xmath72 , @xmath73 are the unitary matrices corresponding to transitions through the lower and upper paths of the interferometer , respectively . equations ( [ effective tb ] ) describe the effective tight - binding equations for hopping between sites @xmath57 and @xmath58 and have the same form as in the diamond interferometer @xcite .",
    "all the details of the interferometer are embodied in the effective hopping matrix @xmath74 and effective site energies @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "we next consider the scattering of a wave coming from the left , i.e.@xmath77 where @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the incoming , reflected and transmitted normalized spinors , respectively , with the corresponding reflection and transmission amplitudes @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "substituting equations ( [ left wave ] ) into ( [ effective tb ] ) , one finds @xmath83 with the @xmath56 transmission and reflection amplitude matrices @xmath84 here we define @xmath85 using equation ( [ w ] ) , the matrix @xmath86 involved in both @xmath87 and @xmath88 , is found to be @xmath89 with @xmath90 the unitary matrix representing anticlockwise hopping from site @xmath57 back to site @xmath57 around the loop .",
    "equation ( [ rotation matrix2 ] ) then yields @xmath91 and equation ( [ wdagw ] ) can thus be written as @xmath92 with @xmath93 here , @xmath94 is a real unit vector along the direction of @xmath95 . as shown in @xcite , the spin - dependent transmission of the interferometer",
    "is determined by the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath86 .",
    "these eigenvalues are given by @xmath96 where @xmath97 are the eigenstates of the spin component along the unit vector @xmath98 , i.e.@xmath99 .",
    "for an incoming spinor @xmath97 the corresponding transmission amplitudes @xmath100 are @xcite @xmath101 , i.e.  their spinor is @xmath102 .",
    "hence , the transmission amplitude matrix ( [ transmission ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath103 here , @xmath104 are the eigenstates of the matrix @xmath105 @xcite , namely @xmath106 where the eigenvalues @xmath107 are given by equations ( [ wdagw eigen ] ) . using equation ( [ w ] ) , the matrix @xmath105 is given by @xmath108 with @xmath109 the unitary matrix representing clockwise hopping from site @xmath58 back to site @xmath58 around the loop .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the spinors @xmath97 and @xmath104 , being the eigenstates of @xmath110 and @xmath111 , respectively , are completely determined by the ab and ac phases and are independent of the electron energy @xmath112 .",
    "as we show below , this implies that spin filtering can be achieved independent of energy , with the spin polarization direction controlled solely by the external electric and magnetic fields ( see below ) . in the next subsection",
    "we analyze the general conditions for spin filtering arising from the transmission amplitude matrix ( [ transmission amplitude matrix ] ) with the transmission amplitudes ( [ transmission amplitudes ] ) .",
    "the spin - polarized current ( along @xmath113 ) at the output of the interferometer is given by @xcite @xmath114p^{}_{\\hat{\\bi{n}}'}(\\varepsilon)\\tr\\left[\\mathcal{t}^{\\dag}\\mathcal{t}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath115^{-1}$ ] is the fermi distribution in the left ( l ) or right ( r ) lead with the corresponding chemical potential @xmath116 and @xmath117 , @xmath118 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath119 is the temperature .",

    "the outgoing electrons with energy @xmath112 are fully polarized along @xmath123 .",
    "this occurs if and only if @xmath124 , or equivalently @xmath125 [ equation ( [ transmission amplitudes ] ) ] . without loss of generality ,",
    "let us consider the case @xmath126 , in which the outgoing electrons are polarized along @xmath113 . from equation ( [ wdagw eigen ] ) it follows that @xmath127 and the equality @xmath126 occurs only if @xmath128 it should be noted that the spin filtering conditions ( [ filtering conditions ] ) are valid for an arbitrary two - path interferometer with soi and ab flux .",
    "the details of a specific interferometer enter through the ac phase @xmath129 and the effective hopping amplitudes @xmath70 and @xmath69 .",
    "the first condition in equations ( [ filtering conditions ] ) can be interpreted as a requirement for a symmetry relation between the two paths .",
    "the second condition in equations ( [ filtering conditions ] ) , namely @xmath130 , imposes a relation between the ab flux and the soi strength .    to achieve an outgoing spin - polarized beam at finite temperature or bias voltage",
    ", the spin polarization @xmath120 should be equal to unity in the relevant energies @xmath131 in which electron transport occurs .",
    "therefore , it is desirable that the spin filtering conditions ( [ filtering conditions ] ) will be satisfied independent of energy . since the second condition in equations ( [ filtering conditions ] ) is energy independent , we focus for the moment on the first condition . from equations ( [ gamma ] ) ,",
    "one readily sees that this condition holds independent of energy if @xmath132 compared to the corresponding relations in the diamond interferometer @xcite , equations ( [ gamma condition ] ) allow much more freedom for the values of the various parameters ( see below ) .",
    "therefore , spin filtering can be achieved even in a very asymmetric interferometer .",
    "furthermore , as argued at the end of the previous subsection , the spinor of the outgoing electrons , @xmath133 , is independent of energy .",
    "hence , the spin filtering is energy independent provided that equations ( [ gamma condition ] ) hold .    to satisfy equations ( [ gamma condition ] )",
    ", one can adopt several approaches .",
    "one possibility is to use a single gate electrode for each branch of the interferometer , so that @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "the conditions ( [ gamma condition ] ) then read @xmath136 the first condition in equations ( [ gamma condition2 ] ) can be satisfied by properly tuning the hopping amplitudes from the leads to the qds / qns , as shown in several experiments @xcite .",
    "the second condition can be satisfied by tuning the gate electrodes .",
    "the third condition can be satisfied by controlling the potential barrier between sites @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( and/or @xmath28 and @xmath14 ) .",
    "a further possibility to satisfy equations ( [ gamma condition ] ) is by using two gate electrodes on each branch of the interferometer @xcite .",
    "then , by tuning two site energies , say @xmath137 and @xmath138 , one can fulfill the second and the third conditions in equations ( [ gamma condition ] ) .",
    "the first condition is again satisfied by tuning one of the hopping amplitudes from the leads to the qds / qns , say @xmath139 .",
    "alternatively , one can work at low temperatures in the linear - response regime , where all the electrons have the same energy , equal to the fermi energy of the leads @xmath140 .",
    "the first condition in equations ( [ filtering conditions ] ) should then be satisfied for a single specific energy @xmath141 .",
    "setting @xmath142 in equations ( [ gamma ] ) , one has @xmath143 in this case one has to tune only a single site energy @xmath144 .",
    "in addition , one should tune the magnetic field or the electric field perpendicular to the plane in order to satisfy the second condition in equations ( [ filtering conditions ] ) .",
    "having fulfilled the spin filtering conditions ( [ filtering conditions ] ) , one would like to optimize the transmission @xmath145 of the polarized electrons . using equation ( [ transmission amplitudes ] ) , the transmission has the form @xcite @xmath146 where @xmath147 the dependence of the transmission on the magnetic flux is only through @xmath148 . substituting @xmath130 and @xmath149 into equations ( [ wdagw eigen ] ) , one has @xmath150 . since one does not expect the tight - binding model to be valid near the band edges , we confine ourselves to the center of the band , @xmath151 or @xmath152 , where the details of the model chosen are not so important . at the band center",
    "we have @xmath153 with @xmath154 and @xmath155 , as required by equations ( [ gamma condition ] ) .",
    "the denominator in equation ( [ transmission ] ) becomes @xmath156\\left[\\varepsilon^{}_{1}+\\left(j^{2}_{b1}\\varepsilon^{}_{a}+j^{2}_{d1}\\varepsilon^{}_{c}\\right)\\gamma^{}_{0}/j^{3}_{1}\\right]-\\lambda^{}_{+}-j^{2}\\big\\}^{2}+j^{2}\\left[\\varepsilon^{}_{0}+\\varepsilon^{}_{1}+\\left(j^{2}_{0a}\\varepsilon^{}_{b}+j^{2}_{0c}\\varepsilon^{}_{d}+j^{2}_{b1}\\varepsilon^{}_{a}+j^{2}_{d1}\\varepsilon^{}_{c}\\right)\\gamma^{}_{0}/j^{3}_{1}\\right]^{2}$ ] , which is minimal at @xmath157 and @xmath158 . in this case",
    "the transmission is @xmath159 , and this has its maximal value of @xmath58 at @xmath160 . for a specific filter one would usually decide around which flux @xmath161 one would like to work .",
    "we thus optimize the transmission for a specific flux @xmath162 .",
    "one has a perfect transmission @xmath163 at a flux @xmath162 if one tunes the parameters so that @xmath164 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 . with these choices ,",
    "the transmission @xmath165 reads @xmath166 the transmission ( [ transmission2 ] ) is plotted in figure [ fig : transmission](a ) as a function of @xmath167 for two values of @xmath161 .",
    "figure [ fig : transmission](b ) shows the transmission @xmath168 versus @xmath169 for the flux fixed at @xmath162 and for @xmath170 , @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "these values correspond to a completely symmetric interferometer in which the hopping amplitudes and site energies of the lower and upper branches are identical .",
    "the transmission depends smoothly on energy and remains close to unity in a range around @xmath152 which increases with increasing @xmath161 .",
    "as expected , the transmission in this case resembles the transmission of the symmetric diamond interferometer @xcite .",
    "the transmission of the polarized electrons , @xmath173 ( a ) as a function of the ab flux @xmath167 ( in units of @xmath174 ) for @xmath175 ( @xmath152 ) and ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) as a function of @xmath169 ( in units of @xmath174 ) for @xmath162 .",

    "[ fig : transmission](c ) we set @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 , @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "this choice corresponds to an asymmetric interferometer described by equations ( [ gamma condition2 ] ) , in which the two branches have the same site energies @xmath187 and hopping amplitudes @xmath188 , but different hopping amplitudes from the leads , namely @xmath189 and @xmath190 .",
    "figure [ fig : transmission](d ) shows the transmission of a completely asymmetric interferometer for which @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 and @xmath191 .",

    ". however , comparing the solid and dashed curves in figures [ fig : transmission](b)-[fig : transmission](d ) , we see that the narrowing of the transmission peak can be circumvented by working at a higher flux @xmath162 .",
    "the results of this subsection thus suggest that perfect spin filtering , independent of energy , can be accomplished in an asymmetric interferometer . by tuning the hopping amplitudes , site energies and ab flux",

    "the polarization direction of these spin - polarized outgoing electrons is discussed in the next subsection .",
    "let us consider now the form of the unitary matrices @xmath193 in the presence of rashba and dresselhaus sois .",
    "first , consider the ab phase @xmath194 . with the gauge @xmath195 ( figure [ fig : square interferometer2 ] ) ,",

    "using equation ( [ rotation matrix1 ] ) and denoting @xmath199 one ends up with the unitary matrices @xmath200 where @xmath201 , with @xmath202 and @xmath203 ( @xmath204 ) .",
    "note that @xmath205 and therefore @xmath206 , with @xmath207 and @xmath208 . to identify the ac phase @xmath129 and the blocked and transmitted spin directions , @xmath209 and @xmath113",
    ", we calculate the matrices @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",
    "straightforward algebra yields @xmath212 where @xmath213 and @xmath214 from unitarity . comparing equations ( [ u matrices ] ) with ( [ wdagw ] ) ,",
    "( [ wdagw eigen ] ) , ( [ wwdag eigen ] ) and ( [ wwdag ] ) , one derives the following relations : @xmath215 equations ( [ u matrices2 ] ) and ( [ ac phase and directions ] ) show that the transmitted spin direction @xmath113 differs from the blocked one @xmath209 in that the components along the @xmath41 and @xmath42 axes are reversed .",
    "let us examine several special cases of equations ( [ u matrices2 ] ) and ( [ ac phase and directions ] ) .",
    "first , suppose that one of the branches of the interferometer , say the lower one , is free of soi .",
    "substituting @xmath216 ( and therefore @xmath217 , @xmath218 ) , equations ( [ u matrices2 ] ) take the form @xmath219 hence , the ac phase in this case is @xmath220 second , if the rashba mechanism is the dominant soi , i.e.@xmath221 , then @xmath222 and equations ( [ u matrices2 ] ) are reduced to @xmath223 the ac phase is then simply @xmath224 . in the opposite limit where @xmath225 , one has @xmath226 and equations ( [ u matrices2 ] ) give @xmath227 note that in both limits @xmath221 and @xmath225 , the ac phase is @xmath228 .",
    "this is not surprising , since the rashba and dresselhaus interactions are related by a unitary transformation .",
    "furthermore , equations ( [ u matrices4 ] ) and ( [ u matrices5 ] ) show that in both limits the polarization of the outgoing electrons is fixed and determined only by the orientation of the crystal axes . for @xmath221",
    "the direction of spin polarization is @xmath229 and for @xmath225 the direction is @xmath230 , where @xmath231 .",
    "this is different from the diamond interferometer in which @xmath113 is a non - trivial function of the soi strength in both the rashba and dresselhaus limits .",
    "the origin of this difference is the geometry of the two interferometers .",
    "the double - dot interferometer consists of two parallel bonds while the diamond interferometer consists of four non - parallel bonds .",
    "hence , one can have a fixed spin polarization at the output of the interferometer provided that rashba soi dominates over the dresselhaus soi , or vice versa .",
    "we have demonstrated that a double - dot interferometer , made of two parallel qds / qns with strong sois and threaded by an ab flux , can serve as a perfect spin filter . as in the previously suggested diamond interferometer @xcite , spin filtering requires two separate conditions .",
    "the first one is the equality of the effective hopping amplitudes for the two branches of the interferometer ( @xmath232 ) , while the second one imposes a relation between the ab and ac phases ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "these two conditions are necessary for a complete destructive interference of a specific spin polarization",
    ".    the first condition can be regarded as a requirement for global symmetry between the two branches of the interferometer .",
    "if the temperature or the bias voltage are not very small , complete spin filtering arises only if one requires the equality @xmath232 to hold independent of the electron s energy .",
    "this imposes several relations between the various site energies and hopping amplitudes . in the previously suggested diamond interferometer @xcite",
    ", these relations required a perfect symmetry between the two branches , i.e.  the global symmetry condition @xmath232 turned into a local one , requiring for example , the equality of the site energies of the dots at the corners of the diamond .",
    "here we have shown that by enlarging the number of site energies and hopping amplitudes , spin filtering can be achieved in a very asymmetric interferometer .",
    "needless to say , this is a very positive feature of the double - dot interferometer for experimental realizations .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that by tuning the ab flux , the transmission of the spin - polarized electrons can still be close to unity in a wide range of energies , even in the asymmetric interferometer .",
    "the number of interferometer parameters can be enlarged by working with elongated qds or qns . in such nanostructures",
    ", one can define several electrodes and control different parts of the nanostructure separately @xcite .",
    "moreover , such systems usually have strong sois , with the rashba soi mostly being the dominant one .",
    "for instance , in inas nanowires the rashba spin - orbit length @xmath233 was found to be @xmath234 @xcite which gives @xmath235 [ we remind the reader that @xmath236 characterizes the strength of the rashba soi ; see equation ( [ rashba hamiltonian ] ) ] .",
    "hence , a nanowire of length @xmath237 would imply @xmath238 , as required by the condition @xmath130 . for a loop of area @xmath239 , the magnetic field required to create",
    "an ab phase @xmath240 is @xmath241 .",
    "the realization of a spin filter using such systems thus seems feasible .",
    "based on the observations above , we suggest the following experiment which can be carried out , for example , using inas elongated qds / qns @xcite . since such systems are usually operated at low temperatures , it is reasonable to assume linear - response regime",
    ". then at the first stage , one has to tune a single site energy , e.g.@xmath144 , in order to satisfy equation ( [ gamma condition3 ] ) .",
    "the ac phase @xmath129 is then fixed , and one has to tune the magnetic field to satisfy the relation @xmath130 .",
    "alternatively , one can apply a fixed magnetic field , and then tune two site energies ( say @xmath242 and @xmath243 ) to satisfy both the condition @xmath130 and equation ( [ gamma condition3 ] ) . either way , at the linear - response regime spin filtering requires the tuning of only two parameters .",
    "moreover , we have recently shown that spin filtering can be achieved even in leaky interferometers @xcite .",
    "thus the experiment suggested above can overcome leakage problems , which can arise in gated qds / qns .",
    "how would one verify that the outgoing electrons are indeed fully spin - polarized ?",
    "one possible way is by using the so - called spin blockade effect .",
    "one introduces a quantum dot with a strong coulomb interaction on or near the outgoing lead @xcite .",
    "starting with no occupation on this dot , and then increasing the gate voltage on it to capture one electron from the polarized flow , will block the current due to pauli s exclusion principle .",
    "this spin blocking was further demonstrated recently , confirming the spin filtering of a quantum point contact which contains an soi @xcite .",
