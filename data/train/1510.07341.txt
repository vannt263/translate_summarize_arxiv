    "the problem is to find a microscopic theory of the second order phase transitions that would allow one to follow a formation of an ordered phase from a disordered phase across an entire critical region continuously .",
    "the microscopic theory should be derived for a given microscopic hamiltonian of a mesoscopic or macroscopic system from the first principles of statistical physics and describe an order parameter , correlations as well as other statistical and thermodynamic quantities . since landau s breakthrough paper of 1937 @xcite",
    ", it is known that the phase transitions , leading to ferromagnetism , bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) , superfluidity , superconductivity , liquid crystal phases , ferroelectricity and so on , originate from restructuring of a many - body system due to spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "landau gave a general mean - field theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "however , an exact solution for a particular ising model of a magnetic phase transition in a 2-dimensional ( 2d ) lattice of spins , found by onsager @xcite in 1944 and presented in detail by yang @xcite in 1952 , showed that the landau theory was incorrect in the most interesting region surrounding a critical point of a phase transition . according to the ginzburg - levanyuk criterion @xcite , found in 1960 , in the critical region of a system s parameters , the fluctuations of the order parameter are anomalously large , that is they exceed the mean value of the order parameter .",
    "thus , it became clear that critical phenomena are intimately related to the anomalously large fluctuations and could be described only by a much more involved theory .",
    "such a theory should go far beyond the simplified picture of an averaged , mean field .",
    "after the development of powerful quantum - field - theory methods in many - body physics in 1950s and 1960s , that problem was attacked by the best theorists both from the point of view of a general theory and the point of view of various particular phase transitions ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "they used all the known machinery of the many - body theory , including green s functions , feynman s and matsubara s diagram techniques , wick s theorem , dyson s equation , renormalization group , and so on .",
    "in particular , an important understanding of the universality of phase transitions in the vicinity of the critical point came from the renormalization - group approach @xcite .",
    "however , the latter mostly deals with the thermodynamic - limit quantities and phenomenological scaling and universality , does not fully account for the constraints of a many - body hilbert space ( in particular , due to an employment of the grand - canonical - ensemble or similar approximations ) , and focuses only on a few terms of an intermediate asymptotic expansion at the wings of the critical region , related mainly to the critical exponents .",
    "the renormalization - group approach does not provide a full solution that would be valid both inside the entire critical region and outside it , in the disordered as well as ordered phases .",
    "thus , the current theory of critical phenomena has a well - established microscopic basis and is complete conceptually , but there is the necessity to develop new , regular , and more powerful methods for finding the full solution .",
    "the most striking fact is an absence of a solution to the major problem of how the systems go through a critical point . in general , it is not known for both equilibrium and nonequilibrium phase transitions . here",
    "the principle difficulty lies in an invalidity of the usually used equations for the order parameter , correlation functions and other related quantities in the central part of the critical region . for example , for the bec neither the state of the art equations for the order parameter and the green s functions ( the gross - pitaevskii and beliaev - popov equations ) for the equilibrium case @xcite , nor the quantum kinetic equations for the nonequilibrium case ( see the most advanced analysis in @xcite ) are valid in the critical region .    here",
    "we should comment on the terminology , adopted in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and employed in the present paper , where the renormalization group approach is named phenomenological to underline its concept of the effective hamiltonians and effective fields .",
    "the latter describe only the long - range correlations in the system at the cost of a rescaling of the short - range fluctuations .",
    "in fact , that rescaling ( i.e. , averaging or course - graining ) procedure constitutes a subtle , often not fully justified and mathematically controlled , approximation in that theory . the exact approach , which takes care of the fields and fluctuations at all scales , is named microscopic .",
    "of course , both approaches constitute the microscopic theory of phase transitions and are based on the same basic principles of the quantum or classical statistical physics of many - body systems , governed by some microscopic interaction hamiltonian .",
    "that terminology is not perfect , but it catches the fact that the renormalization group starts with an approximation of the system and then attempts to find the solution , which could represent only some intermediate asymptotics of the exact full solution . on the contrary ,",
    "the exact approach starts with the rigorous equations , relations and solutions for a mesoscopic , finite system and then analyzes them .",
    "it yields , in principle , more detailed and full information on the critical phenomena and critical functions .",
    "in particular , it goes beyond the thermodynamic - limit critical exponents or intermediate power - law asymptotics of the critical - region wings .",
    "even the exact , nonperturbative renormalization group equations ( for a review , see @xcite ) , including the ones derived by wilson @xcite via an @xmath0-expansion of a space dimensionality @xmath1 for a @xmath2-model , are aimed to approximate the original microscopic hamiltonian by an effective hamiltonian for a large - scale part of a field .",
    "moreover , these exact equations are very difficult to implement due to their complexity . when wilson tried to show `` that the exact renormalization group equations are not hopelessly intractable functional equations '' @xcite , he still substituted them with an approximate recursion formula which is mathematically uncontrollable , but yields the first few orders of the @xmath0-expansion .",
    "so , one must perform approximations and/or truncations , such as in a well - developed method of an effective average action @xcite . in fact , a number of approximations for the renormalization are introduced , including a neglect method , decimation and other real - space renormalization schemes as well as field - theoretical techniques .",
    "however , their rigorous relation to a full exact solution of the mesoscopic problem is still not completely understood .",
    "simultaneously , tremendous effort was spent to study the problem of phase transitions experimentally and numerically in a countless number of various particular many - body systems , including macroscopic and mesoscopic systems , condensed matter , trapped gases , cosmology , relativistic fields , high energy particles , etc .",
    "there is hardly any other problem in physics that attracted such an enormous amount of interest and effort .",
    "suffice it to say that more than thirty nobel prize winners received their nobel awards for the studies related to phase transitions and spontaneous symmetry breaking , including onnes ( 1913 ) , landau ( 1962 ) , feynman ( 1965 ) , onsager ( 1968 ) , n@xmath3el ( 1970 ) , bardeen ( 1972 ) , cooper ( 1972 ) , schrieffer ( 1972 ) , josephson ( 1973 ) , anderson ( 1977 ) , mott ( 1977 ) , prigogine ( 1977 ) , kapitza ( 1978 ) , weinberg ( 1979 ) , glashow ( 1979 ) , salam ( 1979 ) , wilson ( 1982 ) , bednorz ( 1987 ) , m@xmath4ller ( 1987 ) , de gennes ( 1991 ) , lee ( 1996 ) , osheroff ( 1996 ) , richardson ( 1996 ) , cornell ( 2001 ) , ketterle ( 2001 ) , weiman ( 2001 ) , abrikosov ( 2003 ) , ginzburg ( 2003 ) , leggett ( 2003 ) , nambu ( 2008 ) , kobayashi(2008 ) , maskawa ( 2008 ) , englert ( 2013 ) , higgs ( 2013 ) .",
    "hundreds of books and reviews as well as many thousands papers have been devoted to this field of research .",
    "why is the problem of the critical region so important for the theoretical physics ?",
    "an answer follows from a fact that in all other regions of parameters the macroscopic systems show a routine behavior with the normal , gaussian thermodynamic fluctuations , described either by classical or quantum statistical mechanics .",
    "the former was understood in the beginning of the twentieth century due to the works by boltzmann , gibbs et al .",
    "the latter was understood by 1950s after the development of quantum mechanics ( by 1930s ) and quantum field theory ( by 1950s ) .",
    "many - body systems can acquire novel nontrivial properties only in these critical regions , where the microscopic interaction between particles results in a system s self - organization into an ordered phase .",
    "that process restructures the system s configuration and breaks a symmetry , generally , via an internal instability .",
    "thus , a solution to the problem of finding a microscopic theory of phase transitions in the critical region became the major key to progress in our understanding of the macroscopic and mesoscopic systems .",
    "all real systems in the experiments and applications , especially in the modern nanotechnologies , are finite .",
    "their critical regions are also finite and constitute , in fact , the most interesting and important regions of parameters .",
    "resolving the structure of the critical region is equivalent to solving the problem for a mesoscopic ( large , but finite ) system .",
    "the critical region can not be treated as just a discontinuity point , as it was assumed in a standard , bulk - limit analysis of the thermodynamic fluctuations and the proofs of an equivalence of different gibbs ensembles ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a fact , that the singularities are rounded off in the mesoscopic systems , is well known since the ehrenfest s criticism of the einstein s theory of a phase transition in a gas of bose particles and is relevant to the numerous , especially modern experiments and simulations .",
    "its proper description requires the theoretical , computational tools beyond a thermodynamic - limit analysis .",
    "moreover , the solution of the mesoscopic problem is needed for the computation of the thermodynamic - limit critical functions in a close vicinity of the critical point .",
    "the latter functions describe a continuous transition through the critical point and have a self - similar scaling , different from the power - law scaling at the wings of the critical region .",
    "the rigorous results of the presented in @xcite and in this paper microscopic theory of critical phenomena provide such computational tools and complement the renormalization - group finite - size scaling approach .",
    "moreover , the solution of the problem for the equilibrium systems , which is a subject of the present paper , is crucially important also for the theory of more complicated and diverse nonequilibrium phase transitions .",
    "this theory should describe the formation of an ordered phase in various nonequilibrium processes and is even less studied than the equilibrium one ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , despite enormous effort , interest , and importance , the formulated above problem of finding a full microscopic theory of phase transitions has not been solved .",
    "such a theory , that should start from a microscopic hamiltonian and derive the closed universal equations capable to provide the full solution connecting the asymptotics of the ordered and disordered phases across the entire critical region , has not been found so far even for any one of the numerous types of phase transitions .",
    "recently we found a general solution to this problem @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we formulate that microscopic theory for two cases : bose - einstein condensation in an interacting gas ( sect .",
    "3 ) and ferromagnetism in a lattice of spins , interacting via a heisenberg or ising hamiltonian ( sect . 4 - 6 ) .",
    "we derive the fundamental equations for the order parameter and green s functions , which are valid not only in the fully ordered , low - temperature phase , but also in the entire critical region and in the disordered phase .",
    "these equations allow one to resolve a fine structure of the system s statistics and thermodynamics near a critical point both for the mesoscopic and macroscopic systems .",
    "also , they allow one to find the asymptotics at the wings of the critical region and , in particular , the critical exponents and the critical functions .    except for some degenerate cases , like a bec in an ideal gas , a generic process of symmetry breaking is related to an instability in a many - body system that originates from a microscopic interaction between individual particles .",
    "the instability starts from the spontaneous or thermal fluctuations , leads to a growth of the order parameter to a macroscopic level , and ends with a formation of an ordered equilibrium phase with a broken symmetry due to a nonlinear saturation of the instability .",
    "the complex nature of critical phenomena in phase transitions is not reduced even to an interplay of the many - body , instability and nonlinear phenomena .",
    "those processes are subject to a whole set of the simultaneously present and equally important factors , which should be properly taken into account in a correct microscopic theory .",
    "first of all , there are the constraints of a many - body hilbert space",
    ". these fundamental constraints could originate from some local properties of the individual particles or from some nonlocal , global properties of a system s configuration .",
    "( do not mix the term `` constraints of the hilbert space '' with the external parameters or fields in a hamiltonian , like a trap potential @xmath5 or an external magnetic field @xmath6 , which sometimes are also referred to as constraints in the literature @xcite . )",
    "their relation with the integrals of motion , prescribed by a broken symmetry in virtue of a noether s theorem , is also important .",
    "an example of local constraints is given by the occupation numbers @xmath7 of the spin bosons , constituting the spins in the lattice of a ferromagnet .",
    "according to holstein and primakoff @xcite , they are constrained to an interval of values @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the spin value .",
    "an example of global constraints is a particle - number constraint for a system of @xmath10 particles in a trap . that constraint is responsible , via a related constraint - cutoff mechanism , for the very existence of the bec phase transition and its nonanalytical features @xcite .",
    "the latter implies an insufficiency of a grand - canonical - ensemble approximation , which is incorrect in the critical region @xcite because of averaging over the systems with different numbers of particles , both below and above the critical point . that averaging over the condensed and noncondensed phases at the same time implies a relative error on the order of unity for the critical functions",
    "this is well known , but it is very hard technically to go on with the canonical ensemble .",
    "again , the main problem is a computational , theoretical one .",
    "namely , it is to find a rigorous solution , compatible with the particle - number constraint .",
    "moreover , there is a conceptual problem behind the deviation of the grand - canonical - ensemble approximation from the canonical - ensemble result .",
    "namely , a failure of the grand - canonical - ensemble approximation in the critical region persists even in the thermodynamic limit of a macroscopically large system .",
    "it is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : c ] for the specific heat of an ideal bose gas in the box and isotropic harmonic traps .",
    "the exact canonical - ensemble and grand - canonical - ensemble specific heats , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : c ] , are known from an analytical solution for the statistics and thermodynamics of an ideal - gas bec in arbitrary trap .",
    "it was recently found in @xcite and is indistinguishable from the numerically calculated curves in the critical region .",
    "it means that the grand - canonical - ensemble approximation does not allow one to correctly describe a continuous phase transition through the critical point .",
    "that fact is not usually appreciated , probably , in view of an absence of any alternative theoretical tools to compute the result within the canonical ensemble .",
    "the present theory cures that drawback .",
    "note that , even in the thermodynamic limit , the critical region has an order - of - unity width in terms of a self - similar variable @xmath11 .",
    "the latter represents a deviation from the bec critical point in terms of a difference between the number of trapped particles @xmath10 and its critical value @xmath12 , scaled by a dispersion of fluctuations in the number of condensed particles @xmath13 . that variable resolves a fine universal structure of all thermodynamic and statistical critical functions in the critical region .",
    "this structure has a well - defined , smooth limiting form , despite a fact that a size of the critical region in terms of an absolute temperature @xmath14 is shrinking to zero in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "particles , confined in the 3d box with zero dirichlet boundary conditions ( right ) and in the isotropic harmonic 3d trap ( left ) .",
    "the upper plots show the specific heat @xmath15 versus a deviation of temperature from its critical value @xmath16 .",
    "the lower plots show a critical function @xmath17 $ ] that is a deviation of the specific heat from its value at zero chemical potential scaled by a suitable factor @xmath18 , making variation of @xmath19 within a critical region on the order of unity .",
    "the lower plots yield also a universal structure of the specific heat in the thermodynamic limit , since the critical function @xmath20 quickly reaches a limiting form ( i.e. , stops changing ) in that limit due to a use of a self - similar variable @xmath21 .",
    "a thermodynamic limit of the grand - canonical - ensemble ansatz in the usually used approximation of continuous spectrum is shown on the upper plots by the dotted lines and is even more off the exact result.,width=309 ]    an absence of an acceptable diagram technique for the constrained many - body systems ( in particular , for the canonical ensemble ) , which has to be used instead of the standard , unconstrained diagram technique based on the grand canonical ensemble , partly explains why the microscopic theory of phase transitions was not found for such a long time . despite many attempts @xcite ,",
    "the required constrained diagram technique has not previously been found .",
    "second , one has to solve the problem for a finite system with a mesoscopic ( i.e. , large , but finite ) number of particles @xmath10 .",
    "it is necessary in order to correctly calculate an anomalously large contribution of the lowest energy levels to the critical fluctuations and to avoid the infrared divergences of the standard thermodynamic - limit approach @xcite as well as to resolve a fine structure of the critical region .",
    "a finite - size scaling technique ( see , for example , the reviews @xcite ) is aimed at this task , but it is phenomenological and mainly oriented to a numerical analysis of the critical scaling .",
    "last , but not least , is an important fact that in the critical region there are no closed dyson - type equations for the constrained , true green s functions . a crucial finding of the present theory is the exact recurrence equations for the partial one- and two - operator contractions .",
    "they follow from a remarkable property of the partial operator contractions to reproduce themselves under a contraction operation .",
    "the previously developed methods did not allow one to account simultaneously for all these complex factors .",
    "we introduce the required additional techniques , including the following novel methods :    \\(i ) the nonpolynomial diagram technique and partial contraction of operators @xcite ,    \\(ii ) the partial difference ( recurrence ) equations for the operator contractions @xcite ( a discrete analog of the partial differential equations in discrete mathematics @xcite ) ,    \\(iii ) a characteristic function and cumulant analysis @xcite for a joint distribution of the noncommutative observables .",
    "they are required by the very nature of the critical correlations in the constrained systems as well as by the structure of the rigorous many - body theory .",
    "they complement the standard matsubara technique of the green s functions and dyson equation @xcite .",
    "the mean field and related approximations , associated with the landau , bogoliubov , beliaev - popov and similar standard diagrammatic approaches , lead to the incorrect results for the critical behavior and critical exponents .",
    "the renormalization group approach to the constraints in the systems with the critical behavior is also approximate , although it allows one to catch the main power - law critical asymptotics at the wings of the critical region for the models like the non - linear sigma model or the heisenberg model of ferromagnetism .    the main point",
    ", however , is that this renormalization group approach is very different from the exact analysis of the theory presented in @xcite and below . in particular",
    ", the latter allows us to formulate the theory of critical phenomena in the spin systems in terms of the constrained spin bosons and treat those constraints exactly . in that way",
    ", we obtain the exact results , like the ones for the 3d ising model ( sect .",
    "5 ) , which yield not only the critical exponents , but a much more full description of the critical phenomena in the entire critical region .",
    "moreover , we can calculate the critical functions and exponents for the 3d systems by obtaining them from those exact solutions , that is , by a regular green - function s method .",
    "it should be compared with the currently used approximate methods , based , for example , on the physically artificial wilson s @xmath0-perturbation of the space dimensionality @xmath1 , real - space renormalization group , high - temperature series , borel s summation , or numerical simulations .",
    "in retrospect , a desire to build a whole theory around just one or two `` main ideas '' , simplifications or approximations , while missing the other similarly important factors of the complex critical phenomenon in phase transitions , was a typical reason for the failure of many previous attempts to solve the problem .",
    "no one of the principle factors could be missed , if we have to derive the correct microscopic theory in the critical region for a given microscopic hamiltonian from the first principles of statistical physics .",
    "an example of a failure in the critical region and a restriction of an analysis to just a well - formed ordered phase is dyson s theory of spin waves in a ferromagnet @xcite .",
    "apparently , due to a lack of the proper mathematical apparatus , first of all , the partial contraction of operators and diagram technique for the nonpolynomial averages , dyson thought that `` the holstein - primakoff formalism is thus essentially nonlinear and unamenable to exact calculations '' . in sect .",
    "4 we refute dyson s conclusion and show how to solve the problem .    a well - known `` theory of many - body systems : pair theory '' by arnowitt and girardeau @xcite , that was stimulated by a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer theory of superconductivity , is another example of such a `` one - main - idea '' approximation .",
    "another possible reason is a prejudicial disbelief of many theorists in the very possibility to find a rigorous full solution to such a complicated many - body problem .",
    "the latter is clearly seen , for example , in an attitude of bogoliubov to the problem of finding the microscopic theory of bec and superfluidity @xcite .",
    "a nice exposition on the bogoliubov approach is given in a review @xcite .",
    "in most works on the bec and superfluidity , the rigorous microscopic theory in the critical region is not even addressed due to its complexity ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "for example , hohenberg and martin in their famous review on the microscopic theory @xcite explicitly state that `` we have nothing to say on the difficult problem of the phase transition '' .    a recent trend to substitute a consistent microscopic theory of a phase transition in a given system by an approximate calculation of just a restricted subset of its universal features for a phenomenological model , for example , the critical exponents , also contributed to keeping the problem unsolved .",
    "the present paper is dedicated to a great memory of our colleague dick arnowitt and other pioneers of the many - body theory , who paved a way to our understanding of the many - body physics .",
    "the paper is based on the authors talk presented at the symposium in honor of dr .",
    "richard arnowitt , texas a@xmath22 m university , college station , texas , usa , september 19 - 20 , 2014 .",
    "the bec originates from a conservation of the total number of particles @xmath10 in a system : @xmath23 here @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the occupation operators of the nondegenerate ground state @xmath26 and the excited states @xmath27 in a trap .",
    "the creation , @xmath28 , and annihilation , @xmath29 , operators for a @xmath30-eigenstate in a trap obey a canonical commutation relation @xmath31=\\delta_{{\\bf k},{\\bf k'}}$ ] , where @xmath32 is a kronecker s delta .",
    "note that a system of photons in equilibrium inside a black - box cavity does not demonstrate the bec since it lacks a gauge symmetry due to absorption in the cavity s walls and , hence , the number of photons is not its integral of motion .",
    "thus , a rigorous microscopic theory of bec has to be started with an exact reduction of a many - body hilbert space .",
    "it is restricted by the particle - number constraint , which is an integral of motion in virtue of a global gauge symmetry to be broken in the bec phase transition .",
