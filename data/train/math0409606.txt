    "since the seminal work of thurston  @xcite , the concept of orbifold has become a central one in 3-dimensional geometric topology , because it embodies the notion of a 3-manifold and that of a finite group action on that 3-manifold . as a matter of fact",
    ", thurston himself indicated how to prove that , under some natural topological constraints , a 3-orbifold with non - empty singular locus carries one of the 8 geometries , so it is a quotient of a geometric 3-manifold under a finite isometric action ( see  @xcite and  @xcite for modern detailed accounts of the argument ) .    in the case of manifolds ( closed",
    "orientable ones , say ) the two basic obstructions to the existence of a geometric structure are related to the existence of essential spheres and of essential tori .",
    "so one restricts first to irreducible manifolds and next to seifert and atoroidal ones . for this restricted class of manifolds",
    "then one has thurston s _ geometrization conjecture _ ( or _ theorem _ , according to the recent work of perelman  @xcite ) .",
    "this result can be regarded as a _",
    "uniformization theorem _ for 3-manifolds in view of the haken - kneser - milnor theorem ( canonical splitting of a 3-manifold along spheres into irreducible 3-manifolds ) and the jaco - shalen - johansson theorem ( canonical splitting of an irreducible 3-manifold along tori into seifert and atoroidal 3-manifolds ) .",
    "the case of 3-orbifolds is similar , where the first basic obstruction to the existence of a geometric structure is removed by restricting to ( suitably defined ) _ irreducible _ 3-orbifolds",
    ". the natural expectation would then be to have an analogue of the haken - kneser - milnor theorem , asserting that each 3-orbifold canonically splits along spherical 2-orbifolds into irreducible 3-orbifolds .",
    "this result has actually been part of the folklore for several years , but it turns out that to state and prove it in detail one has to somewhat refine the ideas underlying the proof in the manifold case .",
    "this paper is devoted to these refinements .",
    "we will state in the present introduction two versions of the splitting theorem that we will establish below , addressing the reader to section  [ statements : section ] for the appropriate definitions .",
    "[ basic : splitting : teo ] let @xmath2 be a closed locally orientable @xmath0-orbifold .",

    "then @xmath2 contains a finite system @xmath3 of spherical @xmath1-suborbifolds such that :    * no component of @xmath4 is punctured discal .",
    "* if @xmath5 is the orbifold obtained from @xmath4 by capping the boundary components with discal @xmath0-orbifolds , then the components of @xmath5 are irreducible .    any such system @xmath3 and the corresponding @xmath5 , if viewed as abstract collections of @xmath1- and @xmath0-orbifolds respectively , depend on @xmath2 only .",
    "we inform the reader that this result has a dual interpretation in terms of connected sum , discussed in detail in section  [ statements : section ] .",
    "we also note that the existence part of theorem  [ basic : splitting : teo ] may seem to have a purely theoretical nature , which is not pleasant in the context of @xmath0-dimensional topology , where a great emphasis is typically given to algorithmic methods  @xcite .",
    "the next longer statement emphasizes the constructive aspects of the splitting .",
    "[ splitting : intro : teo ] let @xmath2 be a closed locally orientable @xmath0-orbifold .",

    "otherwise choose @xmath8 as one such @xmath1-suborbifold , redefine @xmath3 as the given @xmath3 union @xmath8 , redefine @xmath5 as the orbifold obtained from the given @xmath5 by cutting along @xmath8 and capping the result by discal @xmath0-orbifolds , and repeat step 1 .",
    "* if all cyclic spherical @xmath1-suborbifolds of @xmath5 are inessential , turn to step 3 .",
    "otherwise choose @xmath8 as one such @xmath1-suborbifold , redefine @xmath3 and @xmath5 as in step 1 , and repeat step 2 . *",
    "if all vertex spherical @xmath1-suborbifolds of @xmath5 are inessential , output @xmath3 and @xmath5 .",
    "otherwise choose @xmath8 as one such @xmath1-suborbifold , redefine @xmath3 and @xmath5 as in step 1 , and repeat step 3 .",
    "then the process is finite and the final @xmath5 consists of irreducible @xmath0-orbifolds .",
    "moreover , the final @xmath3 and @xmath5 , viewed as abstract collections of @xmath1- and @xmath0-orbifolds respectively , depend on @xmath2 only , not on the specific process leading to them .",
    "in addition , at all steps of the process the essential spherical @xmath1-orbifold @xmath8 can be chosen to be normal with respect to a triangulation of the given orbifold @xmath5 .    for the reader familiar with the proof of the splitting theorem for manifolds ( see for instance  @xcite )",
    "we will now point out what goes wrong in the orbifold case , and sketch how we have modified the argument . the main steps to show the existence of a splitting of a manifold @xmath9 into prime ones are as follows :    * show that if @xmath9 contains a non - separating sphere then it splits as the connected sum of @xmath10 or @xmath11 and some @xmath12 , and the first betti number of @xmath12 is smaller than that of @xmath9 .",
    "deduce that one can restrict to @xmath9 s in which all spheres are separating .",
    "* define a family of spheres @xmath13 to be _ essential _ if no component of @xmath14 is a punctured disc .",
    "show that every essential @xmath3 can be replaced by one having the same number of components and being normal with respect to any given triangulation of @xmath9 .",
    "deduce that all maximal essential systems of spheres are finite . *",
    "prove that if @xmath3 is a maximal essential system then the manifolds obtained by capping off the components of @xmath15 are irreducible .",
    "uniqueness is more elaborate to prove , but its validity only depends on the following fact , that we express using the dual viewpoint of connected sum :    * the sphere @xmath16 is the only identity element of the operation of connected sum .",
    "no connected sum with @xmath16 should be employed to realize a manifold .    turning to orbifolds",
    ", we can show that none of the points ( a)-(d ) has a straight - forward extension :    * the existence of a non - separating spherical @xmath1-suborbifold does not imply the existence of an essential separating one ( see fig.[nonsep : fig ] below ) .",
    "in particular , there are infinitely many 3-orbifolds containing some non - separating but no essential separating spherical @xmath1-orbifold ( see section  [ prime : section ] ) .",
    "the difficulty given by non - separating spherical @xmath1-orbifolds is mentioned in  @xcite , where the choice is made of cutting along these @xmath1-orbifolds too .",
    "the reasons of our choice of excluding non - separating spherical @xmath1-orbifolds _ tout - court _ will be discussed in section  [ existence : section ] .",
    "we only want to mention here that the techniques of the present paper do not seem to adapt easily to include the case of splitting along non - separating spherical @xmath1-orbifolds .",
    "turning to point ( b ) , we follow  @xcite and define a family @xmath3 of spherical @xmath1-suborbifolds of a 3-orbifold @xmath2 to be _ essential _ if no component of @xmath17 is a punctured discal @xmath0-orbifold .",
    "we now have :    * if @xmath3 is essential and @xmath18 are obtained from @xmath3 by one of the compression moves necessary to normalize @xmath3 , then neither of @xmath19 and @xmath20 need be essential ( see fig .",
    "[ essnocompr : fig ] below ) .    this fact could be viewed as a merely technical difficulty , showing that the theory of normal surfaces is inadequate to prove finiteness of maximal essential systems .",
    "the following fact is however more striking :    * if @xmath3 is a maximal essential system of spherical @xmath1-suborbifolds of @xmath2 , and @xmath5 is obtained by cutting @xmath2 along @xmath3 and capping the result , the components of @xmath5 need not be irreducible ( see fig .  [",
    "essnoirred : fig ] below ) .    given this drawback of the notion of essential system ,",
    "we have refined it to a certain notion of _ efficient splitting system _",
    ", where we impose artificially that the capped components of the complement should be irreducible .",
    "the proof of the existence of efficient splitting systems then requires some more efforts than in the manifold case .",
    "in addition , finiteness of the splitting process in theorem  [ splitting : intro : teo ] does not follow directly from the existence of finite efficient splitting systems .    concerning uniqueness , we have the following :    * there are three different types of connected sums of orbifolds , and each has its own identity , different from the other ones . in a sequence of connected sums of irreducible @xmath0-orbifolds ,",
    "the property that a certain sum is `` trivial '' depends on the order in which the sums are performed .",
    "the same notion of efficient system used to prove the existence of a splitting actually allows to deal also with this problem , and hence to prove uniqueness in theorem  [ basic : splitting : teo ] .",

    "but we can also construct examples of @xmath2 to which proposition  [ non : irred : prop ] applies , leading to an orbifold @xmath98 with non - prime @xmath175 .",
    "for instance , one can take an orbifold constructed exactly as @xmath5 was constructed from @xmath10 , starting instead with @xmath176 , where @xmath177 is a closed orientable surface @xmath177 of positive genus .",
    "our interest in the spherical splitting of @xmath0-orbifolds arose from our program of extending matveev s complexity theory  @xcite from the manifold to the orbifold context .",
    "we actually succeeded  @xcite in generalizing the definition and some of the most significant results , investigating in particular the behaviour under connected sum .",
    "however it turns out that one does not have in general plain additivity as in the manifold case .",
    "we can only prove additivity when there are no vertex connected sums , and we have that complexity is only additive up to a certain correction summand on cyclic connected sums involving at least one purely cyclic singular component .",
    "for this reason in this section we prove that the number of such sums is well - defined :    [ cyc:*:prop ] suppose that a @xmath0-orbifold @xmath2 is a connected sum of irreducible orbifolds without vertex connected sums , and fix an efficient realization @xmath178 of @xmath2 as @xmath179 . for all @xmath180 let @xmath181 be the number of @xmath32-cyclic connected sums in @xmath178 involving at least one singular component without vertices .",

    "to deal with the first operation , we define a modified version @xmath183 of the tree associated to the realization @xmath184 . to construct @xmath183",
    "we associate to each @xmath182 one node for each cyclic component of @xmath185 and one for the union of the non - cyclic components of @xmath185 .",
    "we denote by @xmath186 the set of nodes of cyclic type and by @xmath187 the set of nodes of non - cyclic type .",
    "we now define @xmath183 by taking an edge for each @xmath32-cyclic connected sum , with the ends of the edge joining the singular components involved in the sum .",
    "the ideas behind the construction of @xmath183 are as follows .",
    "first , we can not create a new @xmath32-cyclic singular component by performing an ordinary connected sum or a @xmath188-cyclic connected sum for @xmath189 .",
    "second , a cyclic connected sum between two cyclic components gives one cyclic component , while a cyclic connected sum between a non - cyclic component and any other one gives one or two non - cyclic components . with these facts in mind",
    ", it is very easy to see that the invariance of @xmath181 under the first move is implied by the following graph - theoretical statement : _ let @xmath90 be a tree with set of nodes @xmath190 .",
    "let @xmath191 be an ordering of the edges of @xmath90 . for @xmath192 define @xmath193 to be @xmath194 if both the ends of @xmath195 can be joined to nodes in @xmath187 by edges in @xmath196 only , and to be @xmath93 otherwise .",
    "then @xmath197 is independent of @xmath198_.        without affecting the sum in question .",
    "this allows us to assume that all the nodes in @xmath187 are `` external , '' _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath93-valent . moreover , using induction",
    ", we can suppose that @xmath187 consists precisely of the external nodes , because if an edge @xmath199 has an end which is external and belongs to @xmath186 then @xmath200 whatever the position of @xmath199 in the ordering , and the value of @xmath82 on the remaining edges does not depend on the position of @xmath199 in the ordering .",
    "[ graph : lem ] let @xmath90 be a tree .",

    "then @xmath205 is independent of @xmath198 , and precisely equal to @xmath206 .",
    "attach a circle to @xmath90 by gluing the nodes in @xmath203 to @xmath207 arbitrarily chosen points on the circle , and denote by @xmath5 the result .",
    "since @xmath90 is a tree , we have @xmath208 .",
    "let @xmath191 be an ordering of the edges of @xmath90 , let @xmath209 be the union of the circle with @xmath210 , and let @xmath211 be the connected component of @xmath209 which contains the circle .",
    "of course @xmath212 is the circle and @xmath213 .",
    "we now have the identity @xmath214 which is easily established by considering separately the cases where @xmath195 has @xmath194 , @xmath93 , or @xmath1 ends on @xmath215 , and using again the fact that @xmath90 is a tree .",
    "the identity implies that @xmath216    to conclude the proof of proposition  [ cyc:*:prop ] we must now show that @xmath181 is not affected by the moves @xmath82 and @xmath140 . knowing the independence of the ordering",
    ", this is actually very easy .",
    "for both the moves , we have two realizations @xmath217 and @xmath218 of @xmath2 leading to splitting systems @xmath219 and @xmath220 which differ for one component only , so @xmath221 and @xmath222 .",
    "we then compute @xmath223 by performing first the connected sum which corresponds to @xmath224 . from figg .",
