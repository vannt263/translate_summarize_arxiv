    "mwc 349a is a peculiar b[e ] star which happens to be the brightest continuum source of its kind at cm wavelengths ( e.g.  braes et al .  1972 ;",
    "tafoya et al .",
    "it is located in the direction of the cyg ob2 association , at a distance which has been estimated between 1.2 kpc ( cohen et al .  1985 ) and 1.7 kpc ( hofmann et al .",
    "mwc349a may have a b0 iii companion ( named mwc 349b ) , located @xmath3 to its west ( merrill et al .",
    "1932 ; cohen et al .",
    "the cm radio continuum emission from mwc 349a can be successfully described in terms of an isothermal wind photoevaporating from the surface of a neutral keplerian disk surrounding a young massive star ( lugo et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "mwc 349a also exhibits hydrogen recombination line emission detectable from the radio ( altenhoff et al .  1981 ) to the optical ( hartmann et al .  1980 ) .",
    "the intensity of the recombination lines at cm wavelengths was found to be consistent with nearly thermal , lte conditions ( e.g.  altenhoff et al .",
    "1981 ; escalante et al .   1989 ; rodrguez & bastian 1994 ) . however , in a remarkable discovery , martn - pintado et al .",
    "( 1989a ) found that the mm recombination lines towards mwc 349a were emitting in a maser mode , and were therefore tens of times stronger than expected for thermal conditions .",
    "this discovery was rapidly confirmed , and it is now known that all the hydrogen recombination lines at mm , sub - mm , far - ir and mid - ir wavelengths ( from h39@xmath0 at about 100 ghz to h7@xmath0 at about 16,000 ghz ) are masing ( gordon et al .",
    "2001 ; thum et al .",
    "1994a ; strelnitski et al .",
    "1996a , 1996b ; thum et al .",
    "these maser lines are also known to be time variable ( martn - pintado et al .",
    "1989b ; gordon et al .",
    "2001 ) . to this date , mwc 349a remains the only source known to show such high - gain natural hydrogen maser emission .",
    "the line amplification has been investigated theoretically by thum et al .",
    "( 1994b ) and ponomarev et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , and is believed to arise in the inner region of a nearly edge - on disk where the eastern region is redshifted with respect to the western one ( planesas et al .",
    "1992 ; weintroub et al .",
    "2008 ) .    in an unexpected turn of events ,",
    "martn - pintado et al .",
    "( 1993 ) reported that the h66@xmath0 recombination line at 22 ghz was about 5 times stronger than expected from thermal emission , and argued that this line must , therefore , also be masing .",
    "this was surprising and implied that the maser effect could still be present at wavelengths as large as 1.3 cm .",
    "the observations reported by martn - pintado et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , however , were taken with the very large array ( vla ) at the time when it only had limited spectral capabilities .",
    "in particular , the observations were made with a total velocity coverage of only about 160 km s@xmath4 , barely enough to include the entire width of the h66@xmath0 line .",
    "this restriction could have led to an improper continuum subtraction and to an overestimate of the line intensity . in this _",
    "letter _ , we take advantage of the greatly enhanced spectral capabilities of the expanded very large array ( evla ) to reobserve this important source and obtain accurate h66@xmath0 line parameters .",
    "the data were collected with the expanded very large array in its most compact ( d ) configuration on june 16 , 2010 while 22 antennas were available in the array .",
    "five of these antennas had to be flagged because they consistently delivered low visibility amplitudes or because they exhibited significant phase jumps .",
    "as a consequence , the final data products were constructed from observations collected on 17 antennas only . the correlator was set up to deliver 256 spectral channels , each 500 khz wide , centered on the rest frequency of the h66@xmath0 line at 22.364 ghz .",
    "this corresponds to a total velocity coverage in excess of 1,700 km s@xmath4 ( about 10 times the velocity coverage of martn - pintado et al .",
    "1993 ) , and a spectral resolution of about 6.7 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the data were calibrated with the common astronomy software applications ( casa ) package following standard procedures .",
    "the bandpass was measured using observations of j17430350 and j0319@xmath54130 ( 3c84 ) obtained at the beginning and the end of the observations .",
    "the flux scale was set using an observation of j0137@xmath53309 ( 3c48 ) .",
    "finally , the amplitude and phase gains were monitored using observations of j2015@xmath53710 ( with a bootstrapped flux density of 2.3 jy ) obtained roughly every 10 minutes throughout the 3 hours of observations .",
    "both the continuum and the h66@xmath0 line were clearly detected in the observations , so two data sets were created from the calibrated visibilities .",
    "a continuum data set was generated by averaging 137 line - free spectral channels ( corresponding to an equivalent bandwidth of about 70 mhz ) .",
    "simultaneously , a continuum - free spectral line data set was created by subtracting a constant continuum ( measured over the same 137 line - free channels ) from the initial data .",
    "both data sets were then imaged using robust weighting and 0.5 arcsecond pixels .",
    "the resulting angular resolution was @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 ; p.a .",
    "60.7@xmath9 . to improve the overall calibration ,",
    "the continuum data set was self - calibrated in phase only and the resulting gain corrections were applied both to the continuum and the continuum - free spectral line data sets which were then re - imaged .",
    "the continuum image shows the presence of a strong point - like source at the expected position of mwc 349a ( @xmath10 = @xmath11 ; @xmath12 = @xmath13 ) . a 2d gaussian fit to this source yields an integrated flux of 411 mjy with a formal error of a fraction of a mjy .",
    "this error , however , does not account for the systematic uncertainty on the absolute flux calibration .",
    "we estimate this systematic uncertainty to be about 10% , and conclude that the 22.3 ghz flux of mwc 349a is @xmath14 = 411 @xmath1 41 mjy .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the flux obtained in previous 1.3 cm observations of mwc 349a .",
    "for instance , tafoya et al .",
    "( 2004 ) reported a 22.4 ghz flux density of 446.2 @xmath1 44.8 mjy .",
    "we note , also , that changes in the morphology of mwc 349a at cm wavelengths are known to have occurred ( rodrguez et al .  2007 )",
    ", so moderate variations in its flux density might also be present .    in the continuum - free spectral data set ,",
    "emission is clearly detected in more than 40 contiguous spectral channels around the frequency of the h66@xmath0 line .",
    "this emission remains unresolved at the angular resolution of our observations , so a single - pixel spectrum at the peak position of the source ( figure 1 ) provides a complete description of the line emission .",
    "this spectrum shows a very prominent double - peaked feature surrounded by a 1,200 km s@xmath4 emission - free spectral baseline .",
    "this baseline is remarkably linear but not flat .",
    "instead , it shows a slope which most certainly results from the combined effect of the true positive spectral index of mwc 349a ( e.g.tafoya et al .",
    "2004 ) and the uncorrected negative spectral indices of the flux and bandpass calibrators . a spectrum with a linear baseline removed is shown in figure 1b . the vla observations reported by martn - pintado et al .",
    "( 1993 ) only covered the spectral bandwidth shown by the thick horizontal bracket on figure 1b .",
    "it is clear that this spectral window barely contains the most prominent spectral line detected here , and does not include at all the weaker feature seen at more negative velocities .",
    "since observations with such a limited velocity coverage would contain no channels free of line emission , it would clearly be nearly impossible to properly subtract a continuum from them .     line .",
    "the best fit to the slope in the spectral baseline with a straight line is shown as a solid black line .",
    "( b ) baseline - subtracted spectrum .",
    "the velocity coverage of the vla data presented by martn - pintado et al .",
    "( 1993 ) is shown as a horizontal bracket below the spectral lines .",
    "the blue solid line shows a fit with two unconstrained gaussian components .",
    "the red solid line shows a similar fit but with the velocity separation between the two components constrained to be 122.2 km s@xmath4 , the expected velocity separation between the h66@xmath0 and the he66@xmath0 lines . ]    a simultaneous fit to the spectrum with two gaussian components ( blue solid line in figure 1b ) provides the parameters listed in table 1 .",
    "the separation in velocity between the two spectral features is 130.4 @xmath1 4.4 km s@xmath4 , very similar to the separation ( 122.2 km s@xmath4 ) expected between the hydrogen and helium 66@xmath0 recombination lines .",
    "indeed , a fit where the separation between the two spectral components is constrained to be 122.2 km s@xmath4 ( red solid line in figure 1b ) is very nearly as good as a fit where the separation can vary freely ( the parameters corresponding to that constrained fit are also given in table 1 ) .",
    "we conclude that the weaker spectral feature seen at more negative velocities in our spectrum is the he66@xmath0 line .",
    "we note that thum et al .",
    "( 1992 ) also identified a blue - shifted feature in their h41@xmath0 spectrum of mwc 349a , and favored an interpretation where that additional component is the he41@xmath0 line .",
    "the present results clearly lend strong support to that interpretation .",
    "interestingly , however , the he41@xmath0 line detected by thum et al .",
    "( 1992 ) appears to be at a somewhat more negative radial velocity than its hydrogen counterpart ( @xmath15 = 31 km s@xmath4 vs.  @xmath15 = @xmath51 km s@xmath4 ) . if our unconstrained fit is taken at face value , the he66@xmath0 line is also at a more negative radial velocity than the h66@xmath0 line ( @xmath15 = 15.2 @xmath1 4.3 km s@xmath4 vs.  @xmath15",
    "= 7.0 @xmath1 0.7 km s@xmath4 ) , but the difference is significantly less than for the 41@xmath0 lines . we will come back to that point in section 4.3 .",
    "we note , finally , that the h66@xmath0 line also shows a hint of excess emission on the redshifted side that may be related to the winds predicted in the models of avalos & lizano ( in preparation ) .",

    "the h66@xmath0 line to continuum ratio reported by martn - pintado et al .",
    "( 1993 ) is typically about 20% .",
    "in contrast , the line peak temperature found here ( 25 mjy ) is only about 6% of the underlying continuum . a somewhat more robust line to continuum ratio of about 5%",
    "is obtained by averaging over the central 90 km s@xmath4 of the line . in lte conditions and adopting a full width at half power of 90 km s@xmath4 and an electron temperature of 8,000 k , the h66@xmath0 line is predicted to represent about 5% of the underlying continuum ( altenhoff et al .",
    "1981 ; rodrguez 1982 ; martn - pintado 2002 ) in excellent agreement with the observed values .",
    "we conclude that the h66@xmath0 line in mwc 349a is largely thermally excited and is not strongly masing as had been suggested by martn - pintado et al .",
    "( 1993 ) .",
    "one could argue , however , that our results and those of martn - pintado et al .",
    "( 1993 ) are not necessarily incompatible because the two sets of observations might trace different regions of mwc 349a . in particular",
    ", the present observations were obtained in the most compact ( d ) configuration of the evla and are , therefore , sensitive to even fairly extended emission .",
    "if it existed , such extended emission would have been filtered out in the observations reported by martn - pintado et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , because they were collected in the most extended ( a ) configuration of the vla .",
    "could our observations be dominated by extended , thermally excited gas , and those of martn - pintado et al .",
    "( 1993 ) by denser , more compact masing regions ?",
    "this appears not to be the case for the following reasons . at a wavelength of 1.3 cm ,",
    "the ( e)vla in the a configuration is sensitive to any structure more compact than about 2.5 arcseconds .",
    "our observations , on the other hand , show that the line emission detected here originates in a region more compact than about 1.5 arcseconds .",
    "thus , there are no spatial scales contributing to the emission reported here and to which the observations by martn - pintado et al .",
    "( 1993 ) were not sensitive .",
    "_ the two sets of observations trace essentially the same gas .",
    "_ moreover , at 1.3 cm , the size of mwc 349a is about @xmath16 @xmath7 @xmath16 ( e.g.  tafoya et al .   2004 ; rodrguez et al .  2007 ;",
    "martn - pintado et al .",
    "since the angular resolution of the ( e)vla at 1.3 cm in the a configuration is about @xmath17 , mwc 349a only contains 4 independent resolution elements at that wavelength .",
    "thus , the four spectra reported by martn - pintado et al .",
    "( 1993 ) in their figure 2 trace most of the extent of the source , and the continuum emission integrated over these four positions will be about 300 mjy ( the total continuum emission estimated by martn - pintado et al .",
    "according to the spectra shown in figure 2 of martn - pintado et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , the mean intensity of the h66@xmath0 line over the velocity range from @xmath1860 to @xmath550 km s@xmath4 is about 20% of the underlying continuum .",
    "the line intensity integrated over these 4 positions must therefore be about 60 mjy . as a consequence ,",
    "the integrated line flux measured over any larger area should be at least 60 mjy in that velocity range . yet , in our spectrum ( corresponding to a @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 beam ) , the flux density is systematically smaller than 25 mjy ; averaged over the @xmath1860 to @xmath550 km s@xmath4 velocity range , it is 18 mjy .",
    "we conclude that martn - pintado et al .",
    "( 1993 ) have overestimated the line intensity by a factor 3 to 4 .",
    "we can only speculate about the exact reasons which led martn - pintado et al .",
    "( 1993 ) to over - estimate the h66@xmath0 line intensity in mwc 349a . in principle , the lack of line - free channels in their observations should have led them to over - estimate the continuum flux ( since the channels on the edge of the bandpass used to calculate the continuum still contained line emission ) and to under - estimate the line to continuum ratio ( rather than the other way around ) . instead ,",
    "a more subtle effect , also related to the narrow bandwidth of their observations might have been the culprit .",
    "the velocity channels on the edge of the vla bandpass are well known to be very noisy .",
    "a continuum measurement based on these channels may have seriously underestimated the continuum flux density , and adversely affected the line to continuum ratio measurement .",
    "our results show that the excitation of the h66@xmath0 line very nearly corresponds to lte conditions .",
    "in this situation , the line behaves as if it were approximately optically thin ( see rodrguez 1982 ) . given its similar excitation and lower abundance",
    ", the he66@xmath0 line will also behave as if it were approximately optically thin , so the integrated line intensity ratio provides a direct measure of the ionized helium over ionized hydrogen abundance ratio @xmath2 . from the unconstrained fit ( section 3 ) , we obtain @xmath19 , in good agreement with the value ( 0.10 @xmath1 0.01 ) found by thum et al .",
    "( 1992 ) for the 41@xmath0 lines .    as a consequence of its relative abundance",
    ", the opacity of the helium lines is expected to be about 10 times less than that of the hydrogen lines , so the helium lines are not anticipated to be masing ( even at mm wavelengths ) .",
    "this presumably explains why the helium lines associated with strongly masing hydrogen lines at mm , sub - mm , far - ir and mid - ir wavelengths have not been detected in existing observations .",
    "since the hydrogen lines are tens of times stronger than thermal , the helium to hydrogen line intensity ratio will typically be less than 1% at mm wavelengths .",
    "the noise level of the mm observations was almost certainly adapted to detect the hydrogen lines , and was insufficient to reach the much weaker helium lines .",
    "the high quality of the data presented here allows us to estimate the electron temperature of the ionized gas in mwc 349a .",
    "following rodrguez et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , and assuming lte conditions , the electron temperature , @xmath20 , of an ionized , partially optically - thick outflow is given by :    @xmath21 = \\biggl[{4700 \\over ( 1 + y^+ ) }   { { s_c } \\over { s_l } } \\biggl({{\\nu_l }   \\over { ghz } } \\biggr)^{1.1 }   \\biggl({{\\delta v } \\over   { km~s^{-1}}}\\biggr)^{-1 } \\biggr]^{0.87},\\ ] ]    where @xmath22 is the line frequency , @xmath23 is the continuum flux density , @xmath24 is the hydrogen peak line flux density , and @xmath25 is the hydrogen fwhm line width . using the helium abundance estimated above and the line and continuum parameters measured in section 3 , we obtain @xmath26 k. this value is consistent with those determined from other radio observations ( white & becker 1985 ; cohen et al .  1985 ;",
    "escalante et al .  1989 ) .",
    "the kinematics of the ionized gas associated with mwc 349a presents several problems that require additional research . for instance , the direction of rotation determined from the cm thermal lines ( eastern side blueshifted and western side redshifted ; rodrguez & bastian 1994 ) is opposite to that found in the mm maser lines ( planesas et al .  1992 ; weintroub et al .  2008 ) . also ,",
    "while the thermal radio recombination lines at cm wavelengths peak at negative velocities ( typically @xmath15 @xmath27 20 km s@xmath4 ; e.g.  rodrguez & bastian 1994 ) , the centroid of maser mm radio recombination lines is at positive velocities ( @xmath15 @xmath27 @xmath510 km s@xmath4 ; e.g.  weintroub et al .",
    "2008 ) .    in our unconstrained fit",
    ", the lsr velocity of the he66@xmath0 line appears to be 15.2 @xmath1 4.3 km s@xmath4 whereas the lsr velocity of the he41@xmath0 line reported by thum et al .",
    "( 1992 ) is 31 @xmath1 8 km s@xmath4 .",
    "thus , on average , the helium lines appear to peak at @xmath15 @xmath27 20 km s@xmath4 , similar to the velocity of the thermal cm lines of hydrogen .",
    "this strongly suggests that the helium lines originate in the same gas as the thermal cm hydrogen lines .    the h66@xmath0 line detected here peaks at a velocity ( 7.0 @xmath1 0.7 km s@xmath4  section 2 ) , intermediate between the @xmath510 km s@xmath4 masing mm lines , and the 20 km s@xmath4 thermal cm lines .",
    "a plausible ( albeit somewhat _ ad hoc _ ) explanation is that the h66@xmath0 line is largely dominated by a thermal component at 20 km s@xmath4 but also contains a moderate masing component around @xmath510 km s@xmath4 . the reversed situation might occur with the h41@xmath0 line at 92 ghz reported by thum et al .",
    "( 1992 ) which peaks at @xmath51.0 @xmath1 0.9 km s@xmath4 . in that second case ,",
    "the emission might be dominated by the masing line at @xmath510 km s@xmath4 but with a moderate thermal contribution .",
    "it would be interesting to analyze further the relative kinematics of the hydrogen and helium lines , for instance by obtaining high resolution evla observations of the 53@xmath0 and 66@xmath0 lines at 0.7 and 1.3 cm , respectively .",
    "we have presented new evla observations of the 22.3 ghz continuum and the h66@xmath0 line emissions toward the well - studied galactic emission - line star mwc 349a .",
    "the continuum flux density ( 411 @xmath1 41 mjy ) is in good agreement with previous determinations .",
    "the intensity of the h66@xmath0 line ( 25 mjy ) and the line - to - continuum flux density ratio ( 5% ) , on the other hand , are those expected for local thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "this shows that the h66@xmath0 line excitation is largely thermal , and that the line is not strongly masing as had been proposed by martn - pintado et al .",
    "the intermediate radial velocity of the h66@xmath0 line , however , might suggest the existence of a moderate maser component .",
    "the he66@xmath0 recombination line is also detected in our observations , and shows that the ionized helium to ionized hydrogen abundance ratio in mwc 349a is @xmath2 = 0.12 @xmath1 0.02 . because of their shared kinematics , it is likely that the ionized helium gas and the thermally excited ionized hydrogen gas are well mixed .",
    "the electron temperature of that gas is 6,300 @xmath1 600 k.    high - resolution evla observations of this and other recombination lines ( particularly the h53@xmath0 at 0.7 cm ) might help resolve some of the pending issues concerning the kinematics of the gas in mwc 349a . on a more general note , we would like to stress that the present observations demonstrate the enormous potential of the evla to observe wide spectral lines .",
    "when previous vla observations had to rely on _ ad hoc _ and often very uncertain procedures to remove a spectral baseline , the present observations provide a very clean identification of the line and extremely reliable determinations of the line parameters .",
