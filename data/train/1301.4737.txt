    "the ito equation @xcite was first introduced in 1980 as the hirota bilinear equation @xmath1 by introducing variable @xmath2 , equation ( [ itobilinear ] ) is transformed to a soliton equation @xmath3    non - local equation ( [ itointform ] ) is usually written into a local one by the transformation @xmath4 , @xmath5 . neglecting the tilde symbol and the integral constant , we get @xmath6 in the sequel system ( [ itoloalform ] ) will be referred to as ito equation . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "drinfeld and sokolov also found the equation ( [ itoloalform ] ) in their study on the relationship between soliton equation of kdv type and lie algebras , thus some authors referred ( [ itoloalform ] ) as drinfeld - sokolov system @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian structures of ito equation was obtained by liu @xcite .",
    "the lax pair for ( [ itoloalform ] ) is @xcite @xmath7    also in @xcite ito himself gave a solution of ( [ itobilinear ] ) @xmath8 where @xmath9    it had been a long time taking ( [ itosolf ] ) as the @xmath0-function of the soliton solution of ( [ itointform ] ) .",
    "but one has good reason to question whether ( [ itosolf ] ) covers all soliton @xmath0-function of the ito equation : literature @xcite has assumed that for soliton solutions @xmath10 is a sum of exponential traveling waves .",
    "zhang and chen @xcite are among the first ones to try to enlarge the class of soliton solutions of the ito equation .",
    "it seems to us that the solutions obtained in @xcite are still too limited .",
    "@xcite had investigated the ito equation by the method of invariant manifold ( i m ) and solved the first two constraints completely .",
    "but they @xcite did not give the general solution for the higher order constraints .",
    "the results of this paper will reveal some important structures for higher order constraints discussed in @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 will derive the ordinary differential equations ( odes ) for solving the ims suggested by @xcite .",
    "the odes in ref.@xcite is not suitable for numerical integration .",
    "here we give the suitable one . also here",
    "we add an equation for @xmath11 , which is crucial to analyze the ims .",
    "section 3 will present the numerical results for the odes obtained in section 2 .",
    "these numerical results will reveal the general structure of @xmath0 function corresponding to the 2-soliton and 3-soliton solution of the ito equation .",
    "section 4 is the conclusions .",
    "for brevity we use the following notations : @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "the definition of @xmath14 is @xmath15 @xcite .    with eigenfunction @xmath16 ,",
    "the lax pair ( [ itolax ] ) becomes @xmath17 and @xmath18 , which are equivalent to the following differential equations @xmath19 according to @xcite , the constraint for equation ( [ itolaxpsi ] ) is @xmath20 where @xmath21s are real or complex numbers and we can take @xmath22 without loss of generality .",
    "let @xmath23 .",
    "then ( [ itolaxpsi ] ) becomes @xmath24 it is easy to prove @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "altogether we have @xmath27    * remark 1 : * from equations ( [ laxl ] ) and ( [ constrvv ] ) , we can easily see that with respect to @xmath28 there are @xmath29 equations with @xmath30 unknown functions : @xmath31 .",
    "so we can select @xmath32 to be an arbitrary function , i.e. , with respect to @xmath28 , @xmath33 is not limited to the form @xmath34 @xcite .    by ( [ laxl ] ) , ( [ laxp ] ) , ( [ constrvv ] ) and ( [ evolu ] ) , the time evolution of @xmath33 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 become a closed system of odes :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 .",
    "clearly the ode system ( [ odes ] ) contains @xmath41 equations .",
    "next we will introduce an extra differential equation @xmath42 equation ( [ evolf ] ) is very important to reveal the solution structure of equations ( [ odes ] ) .    summing ( [ laxl ] ) over @xmath43 , we immediately get @xmath44 integrating ( [ preu ] ) we get @xmath45 it is easy to prove @xmath46 is independent on @xmath47",
    ". we will use the conservation of @xmath46 to illustrate the precision of the numerical solutions .",
    "because the case @xmath48 had been completely solved in @xcite , we start numerical study from @xmath49 .      the parameters @xmath50 , @xmath51 , can be taken any value in equations ( [ odes ] ) .",
    "for simplicity we take @xmath52    the initial values for unknown functions in ( [ odes ] ) and ( [ evolf ] ) are also arbitrary . in order to make the numerical solving procedure simple we randomly choose them as @xmath53        fig . 1 the difference between @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the calculated @xmath46 is very close to @xmath56 .",
    "1 shows that the numerical precision in our numerical integration for the odes ( [ odes ] ) is very high .",
    "numerical results show that for lots of initials @xmath35s are asymptotically to constants . for initial values ( [ initials2 ] ) , the numerical results are @xmath57        fig .",
    "2 the plot of @xmath58 and @xmath59 .    fig .",
    "2 shows that @xmath58 and @xmath59 will approach to @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively .    by the third equation of ( [ odes ] )",
    ", we can show that the asymptotic behaviors of @xmath62 and @xmath63 are determined by @xmath64    the eigenvalues of @xmath65 are @xmath66    define @xmath67 by the numerical values of @xmath68 and @xmath69 , @xmath70 , we can determine @xmath71 where we can assume @xmath72 . note that ( @xmath73 ) are obtained by only a fuzzy thinking .",
    "the calculated @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are @xmath77        fig .",
    "3 the difference between @xmath78 and @xmath79 . @xmath78 denote @xmath58 with ( [ solvedab2 ] ) and @xmath79 denote the numerical solution of @xmath58 .",
    "3 shows that the form of @xmath58 must be ( [ varphiform2 ] ) .    by the numerical values of @xmath80 , @xmath81",
    ", we can determine @xmath82 and the values of @xmath83 and @xmath84 are @xmath85        fig .",
    "4 the difference between @xmath86 and @xmath87 . @xmath86 denote @xmath11 in ( [ f2 ] ) with ( [ valcs2 ] ) and @xmath87 denote the numerical solution of @xmath11 .",
    "fig.4 shows that the form of @xmath11 must be ( [ f2 ] ) .",
    "the procedures for @xmath88 is just the same as the one for @xmath49 .",
    "all numerical errors are also far smaller than @xmath89 .",
    "we will omit the plots here .",
    "we arbitrarily take the parameters @xmath50 , @xmath90 as @xmath91 then we set the following initial values @xmath92 we can obtain @xmath93    @xmath94    the eigenvalues of @xmath65 are @xmath95    define @xmath96 by the numerical values of @xmath97 , we can determine @xmath98 where we can assume @xmath99 .",
    "the calculated @xmath100 and @xmath101 are @xmath102    similarly the other @xmath103 and @xmath104 ( the coefficients of @xmath69 and @xmath105 ) can also be calculated .",
    "but they do not have much importance , and we will not list them here .    by the numerical values of @xmath80 , @xmath81 , we can determine @xmath106 and the values of @xmath83 and @xmath84 are @xmath107",
    "by the numerical results in section 3 , we can see that for general @xmath29 @xmath108 it can be shown that @xmath83 and @xmath109 are all dependent on @xmath28 and that @xmath110 , @xmath111 are not dependent on @xmath28 and @xmath47 .",
    "therefore we can write @xmath112 where the demand @xmath113 has been removed . by ( [ evolf ] )",
    "we can only get @xmath114 .",
    "the @xmath0-function of the ito equation satisfies @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "so we can not immediately identify @xmath0 with @xmath11 .",
    "but we can still show @xmath0 has the same form as ( [ generalf1 ] ) or we can write @xmath117 of course , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , in ( [ solvedtau ] ) are not arbitrary .",
    "they must satisfy some constraints .",
    "in fact we know there is only one arbitrary function among all the @xmath118s .",
    "a discovering of this paper is that the ode system ( [ odes ] ) is a completely integrable one , which seems to be never seriously studied in the literatures .",
    "therefore we can conclude that the time evolution for the multi - solitons of the ito equation is integrable .",
    "the dependence on @xmath28 for the multi - solitons of the ito equation is equations ( [ laxl ] ) and ( [ constrvv ] ) , which are not completely solved yet . recall that the kdv equation with vanishing boundary condition is completely solved by the multi - soliton solutions of the kdv equation .",
    "likely we conjecture that the ito equation with vanishing boundary condition is completely solved by the multi - soliton solutions governed by equations ( [ laxl ] ) , ( [ laxp ] ) , ( [ constrvv ] ) and ( [ evolu ] )",
