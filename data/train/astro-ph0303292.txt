    "our blue straggler star ( bss ) catalog includes almost 3000 objects extracted from 62 galactic globular cluster ( gc ) cmds which are part of the photometrically homogeneous hst snapshot database ( piotto et al .",
    "2002 ) .    in each cluster ,",
    "the number of bss has been normalized to the total population of stars .",
    "we defined three different specific frequencies ( @xmath0 ) as the ratios of the bss counts to the number of hb , rgb , and hb plus rgb stars , respectively .",
    "the results described below turned out to be independent from the adopted @xmath0 .",
    "figure 1 ( _ upper panel _ ) shows that there is a significant anticorrelation between @xmath0 and the absolute total magnitude @xmath1 of the cluster . in particular , the faintest clusters in our sample ( ngc  6717 and ngc  6838 )",
    "present a bss specific frequency that is more than a factor of 20 larger than that in the brightest clusters .",
    "interestingly enough , pcc clusters ( _ open circles _ ) , with the exception of ngc 5946 that shows an anomalously low value of @xmath0 , share the same distribution as the normal clusters .",
    "a less significant dependence is found with the central cluster density .",
    "there is no clear correlation with the concentration parameter .    king ( 2002 ) demonstrated that the rate of stellar collisions in a king model gc is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the central surface brightness in units of @xmath4pc@xmath5 ( equivalent to @xmath6 ) , and @xmath7 is the core radius in pc . as shown in fig . 1 ( _ lower panel _ )",
    ", @xmath8 anticorrelates with this quantity .",
    "the clusters with the highest collision rates have the smallest relative number of bss . the dispersion of the points in the _ lower panel _ is larger than in the _",
    "upper panel_. we note a saturation in the correlation for the clusters with collision rates smaller than @xmath9 .",
    "the two clusters with the smallest total absolute magnitude do not seem to partecipate to this general trend .",
    "the dependence of the bss relative frequency with the cluster total mass and with the expected collision rate is noteworthy .",
    "clearly , the environment strongly affects the number of bss that a gc can form at the present time .",
    "stellar encounters can favour binary destruction : separation of the soft binaries , merger of hard binaries .",
    "the latter might have given origin to a large number of bss in the past , but now high central density clusters have much less primordial binaries to form bss than low density objects . a decrease in",
    "the number of binaries means lower probability for a bss to form . of course , high density can also favour encounters , and therefore bss formation via collision . the anticorrelation between the binary frequency and the collision rate of fig .",
    "1 suggests that direct collision of stars is not the the dominant mechanism that triggers the formation of bss , while the number of surviving ( primordial ? ) binaries might be the relevant parameter ."
