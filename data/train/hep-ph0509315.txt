    "despite the fact that the standard model ( sm ) for more than twenty years has been considered a consistent and experimentally confirmed theory , the search of new physics ( np ) manifestations has still been continued . as the possible ( and ,",
    "at least , most popular ) phenomena of np , we can name the supersymmetry , the large extra dimensions @xcite and extra neutral gauge bosons @xcite .",
    "the light on this paramount problem of modern physics can be shed by the coming in the near future experiments at the collider lhc .",
    "the experimental investigation of the continuum for the drell - yan production of a dilepton pair , i.e. data on the cross section and the forward - backward asymmetry of the reaction @xmath5 at large invariant mass of a dilepton pair ( see @xcite and references therein ) is considered to be one of the powerful tool in the experiments at the lhc from the np exploration standpoint .",
    "the cause of this is high sensitivity of the dilepton continuum to any modification of sm induced by np .",
    "the research of the np effects is impossible without the exact knowledge of the sm predictions including higher - order qcd and electroweak radiative corrections .",
    "there have been numerous publications on this problem ; let us now determine the place of the presented paper ( further we will discuss only the electroweak corrections , the qcd contributions are out of the presented paper ) .",
    "so , all of the electroweak corrections to ( [ 1 ] ) can be divided conventionally into three categories :    * \\(i ) electroweak corrections induced by gauge boson self energies ( bse ) , * \\(ii ) the other qed corrections ( i.e. radiative corrections induced by at least one additional photon : virtual or real ) , * \\(iii ) the other weak radiative corrections ( wrc ) ( i.e. radiative corrections induced by additional heavy bosons : @xmath0 or @xmath6 ) ,    the first and the second contributions have already been studied ( see papers on pure qed corrections @xcite , and the qed and electroweak corrections in the z - peak region and above in @xcite , and numerous papers cited there ) .",
    "naturally the contribution ( ii ) also requires the consideration of the diagrams with real bremsstrahlung ( to cancel the infrared divergence ) and , therefore , causes the experimentally - motivated kinematical cuts for observed photon ; all of that has been taken into account in paper @xcite .    to describe all contributions to electroweak corrections , it is convenient to use the terminology of the so - called electroweak sudakov logarithms @xcite , i.e. the expressions which are growing with the scale of energy , and thus giving one of the main effects in the region of large invariant dilepton mass . by now",
    "extensive studies have been done in this area .",
    "for instance , the weak sudakov expansion for general four - fermion processes has been studied in detail ( see , for example , @xcite and the recent paper @xcite along with the extensive list of references therein ) . let us note that the ( i ) contribution contains single sudakov logarithms , and in the ( ii ) contribution ( in @xmath7-boxes ) there is also double sudakov logarithms ( dsl ) but they are mutually cancelled out and reduced to single ones ( see section iv ) .",
    "finally , the ( iii ) contribution contains the dsl , and as it will be shown below , they predominate in the region @xmath8 . besides , all of the contributions ( i - iii ) contain zero power of sudakov logs , i.e. terms without weak boson masses .    obviously , the collinear logarithms of ( ii ) qed radiative corrections can compete with the dsl in the investigated region .",
    "this important issue has been studied at the one - loop level in @xcite , where both the qed and weak corrections have been calculated for @xmath9  2  tev , but it has yet remained unsolved in the region of @xmath10  2  tev .",
    "other important contributions in the investigated reaction at high invariant masses are the higher - order corrections ( two - loop electroweak logarithms , at least ) , which also have been studied in the works @xcite , @xcite ( see also the numerous papers cited therein ) .",
    "weak boson emission contribution has been recently calculated in @xcite and the contribution of higher - order corrections due to multiple photon emission has been computed in @xcite , these contributions are beyond the presented calculations .",
    "as has already been mentioned , for the future experiments at lhc aimed at the searches of np in the reaction ( [ 1 ] ) it is important to know exactly the sm predictions , including the radiative background , i.e. the processes , which are experimentally indistinguishable from ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "the important task is the insertion of this background into the cms monte carlo generators , which should be both accurate and fast . for them to be fast",
    "it is necessary to have a set of compact formulas for the wrc which have been obtained here .",
    "though we use the asymptotic approach ( aa ) ( the sudakov logarithms as the parameters of expansion in the investigated region of large @xmath2 ) , retaining the first and zero powers in the expansion we get good accuracy of calculation .",
    "thus , we further introduce basic notations ( section ii ) , show how to calculate the cross section corresponding to the ( iii ) and ( i ) contribution diagrams ( see fig.1,b - h ) : the heavy vertices ( section iii ) , the heavy boxes ( section iv ) , and the boson self energies ( section v ) , we compare our results with those available at the quark level , and we give the numerical estimations of weak radiative corrections to the drell - yan cross section in the region @xmath11 ( section  v ) .",
    "the born cross section for the inclusive hadronic reaction @xmath12 is given in the quark parton model by formula @xmath13 our notations are the following ( see fig.1,a ) : @xmath14 is the 4-momentum of the first unpolarized ( anti)quark with the flavor @xmath15 and mass @xmath16;@xmath17 is the 4-momentum of the second ( anti)quark with the flavor @xmath15 and mass @xmath16;@xmath18 is the 4-momentum of the final charged lepton @xmath19 with the mass @xmath20 ;  @xmath21 is the 4-momentum of the @xmath22-boson with the mass @xmath23 ;  @xmath24 is the 4-momentum of initial nucleons a(b ) .",

    "to construct the contribution of heavy vertices ( hv ) to the radiative corrections ( see diagrams ( b - e ) in fig.1 ) , we used the thooft - feynman gauge and an on - mass renormalization scheme which uses @xmath64 higgs boson mass @xmath65 , and the fermion masses as independent parameters .",
    "appropriate ( for ultrarelativistic limit we are interested in ) results can be taken from ref.@xcite , where renormalized gauge boson fermion vertices for on shell fermions have been obtained .",

    "we impose the experimental restriction conditions on the detected lepton angle @xmath154 and on the rapidity @xmath155 .",
    "for cms detector the cut values of @xmath156 and @xmath157 are determined as @xmath158 then the expression ( [ xsm ] ) with consideration of the experimental restrictions ( [ restr ] ) and the use of theta - functions can be modified to @xmath159 where @xmath31 is the scattering angle of the lepton with the 4-momenta @xmath160 ( @xmath161 ) in the center mass system of hadrons .",
    "this angle has a non - trivial relation with @xmath58 and @xmath47 : @xmath162 let us note here that the second standard cms restriction @xmath163 in the region of large @xmath2 considered here and at ( [ restr ] ) is satisfied completely and automatically .",
    "it can be seen in fig.3 where all of the cms experimental restrictions for @xmath164 have been shown .    in fig.4",
    "the relative corrections are presented @xmath165 as functions of @xmath2 in the region @xmath166 with experimental restrictions of the cms .",
    "index `` @xmath167 '' in all numerical analysis means @xmath168 it can be seen , that the bse , hv , and ww  contributions are most significant , and the ww boxes give the dominant ( negative ) contribution . in fig.4",
    "we can also see the significant contribution of zero power of sudakov logs ( @xmath169 ) : the difference `` ww ( dsl only ) '' - `` ww ( total ) '' is @xmath170 and depends weakly on @xmath2 .",
    "big contribution of @xmath171 justifies the detailed calculations which have been done in section iv .",
    "the @xmath172difference is caused mainly by the @xmath173term in ( [ d1 ] ) , the contribution of @xmath174 ( [ d2 ] ) is far less than 1% .",
    "the total wrc effect is significant : in region @xmath175 is positive , since the sum of positive hv and bse contributions exceeds the negative ww - boxes , but for @xmath176 the total correction is definitely negative and decreases with the increase of @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the @xmath177 correction changes the dilepton mass distribution up to @xmath3 at @xmath178 .",
    "here we should note that the importance of the investigated problem demands the cross - checking of this part with the earlier obtained in @xcite .",
    "the direct comparison between numerical results of the two works is not possible , since in ref.@xcite the effective born approximation has been used to calculate the relative corrections .",
    "we do not use the effective born approximation as the main subject of our investigation is the region of large invariant mass ( @xmath179  1  tev ) where this approach is illegal .",
    "fortunatly , recent paper @xcite provides the possibility to compare the results of ref.@xcite and presented by us in the region of high invariant dilepton mass ( see the first picture in fig.7 of @xcite ) . at first glance",
    "the results look absolutely different : for @xmath180  tev the relative corrections of @xcite is @xmath181 whereas our result is @xmath182 .",
    "however , the solid line in fig.7 of @xcite correspons to total one - loop result and to compare correctly we should add the photon corrections : `` soft '' and `` hard '' photon contributions .",
    "we have our own code for calculation of this part ( fortran program ready ",
    "`` radiative corrections to large invariant mass drell - yan process '' , which is supposed to be published in the near future , for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "main features of ready are the same as in ref.@xcite : using the `` soft''-``hard '' separator @xmath183 and independence of total result on it , lepton identification cuts reduce extremely the `` hard '' fsr contribution and so on . for the decision of quark mass singularity problem we used the procedure of linearization @xcite .",
    "the `` soft '' part , which we should add to pure wrc for comparison with @xcite , is large and negative ( for example , at @xmath184  tev , @xmath185  gev and @xmath186 the fsr - part of `` soft '' relative correction defined by formulas ( 72),(73 ) in ref.@xcite equals @xmath187 .",
    "the positive `` hard '' fsr - part suppressed by lepton identification requirements will be far less , and the rest parts ( isr after quark mass removing , and the mass - independing interference ) will be small as compared to the fsr . hence , we are supposed to have a rather good ( at least qualitative ) agreement with hadron estimations of ref.@xcite : the relative correction will be negative and decrease with @xmath2 in region @xmath188  0.5  tev .",
    "unfortunatly the ready is not quite complete and here we can not present more exact numbers , but we hope future publications of the results of code ready must clarify this problem later .    in the end of this section",
    "we want to discuss the effect of the pdfs on the weak radiative corrections in this very high mass regime , and what uncertainty they introduce .",
    "comparing the results for cteq6 set @xcite and mrst 2004-qed set @xcite of pdfs the essential effect of pdf choice for the cross sections has not been noticed , the relative error is on one per cent level and has no tendency to increase with the increase of @xmath2 , at least at @xmath189  tev ( unfortunately mrst 2004-qed set for @xmath190 gev , i.e. for @xmath191  tev , does not work , and it does not allow to compare the result for both sets of pdf in the region of extremely high invariant masses ) .",
    "the weak radiative corrections with the neutral current to the drell - yan process for large invariant mass of a dilepton pair have been studied .",
    "the compact asymptotic expressions have been obtained , which expand in the powers of the sudakov electroweak logarithms . at the parton level the investigated radiative corrections",
    "have been compared with the existing results and a rather good coincidence at energy @xmath192  0.5  tev have been found .",
    "the numerical analysis in the high energy region has been performed with use of the standard cms cuts .",
    "it has been found that the considered radiative corrections become very significant at high dilepton mass , and their large scale does not permit to neglect this part of the radiative correction procedure in the future experiments at lhc directed on the np research in the drell - yan process .",
    "some part of corrections has become beyond the scope of the presented paper ( the qcd corrections , the pure qed corrections , and the two - loop electroweak logarithms ) , and still it requires a thorough analysis in order for us to completely solve the radiative corrections problem to the drell - yan process at extremely high energies .",
