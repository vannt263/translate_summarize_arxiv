    "shock reflection problem , which has captured the interest of researchers over the years , is one of the most important problems for the mathematical theory of multidimensional conservation laws that is still largely incomplete .",
    "the experimental , computational and asymptotic analyses show that various patterns of reflected shocks may occur including the regular and mach reflections ( see , courant and friedrichs @xcite , glimm and majda @xcite , glass @xcite , zheng @xcite , ben - dor @xcite , chen @xcite , and chang & hsiao @xcite ) .",
    "when a weak plane shock hits a wedge head on , two processes take place simultaneously .",
    "the incident shock wave is reflected by the wedge surface and at the same time the flow behind it is deflected by the wedge corner , producing a nearly circular diffracted wave expanding from the vertex ; the circular wave emanating from near the vertex moves at sonic speed of the incident flow . here",
    ", we consider the case in which only regular reflection is expected to occur ; for small disturbance approximation in weak shock reflection , this corresponds to relatively large wedge angles . the reflected shock , which is weak enough , travels backward to join the diffracted wave smoothly .",
    "the flow in the diffracted wave region was calculated by keller and blank @xcite using the linearized theory ; this solution was modified later by hunter and keller @xcite using the theory of weakly nonlinear geometrical acoustics @xcite .",
    "they showed that the diffracted wavefronts of linear acoustics are actually shocks .",
    "an approximate analytical solution to the shock - wedge diffraction problem was proposed by harabetian @xcite using an alternate method that invokes perturbation expansions with multiple scales .",
    "much effort has been devoted to the study of this problem through simplified models that capture various features of euler system within the context of an ideal gas ( see , morawetz @xcite , zheng @xcite , rosales and tabak @xcite , brio and hunter @xcite , canic et al .",
    "@xcite , and hunter & tesdall @xcite ) .",
    "it is well known that at high pressure or low temperature , the behavior of gases deviates from the ideal gas - law and follows van der waals type gas that deals with the possible real gas effects ( without phase - transition ) ; examples cover a family of shock wave problems with complicated interface patterns and a hydrodynamic model of sonoluminescene ( an acoustic - induced light emission phenomenon ) ( see,@xcite ) . in the present paper ,",
    "we study the regular reflection configuration and the detachment criterion when the real gas effects are taken into account . in the limit of vanishing van der waals excluded volume",
    ", we recover the result obtained by chang and chen @xcite , which is a refinement of von neumann s criterion .",
    "one of the main objectives of the present paper is to study how the real gas effects influence the behavior of the local structure of the self - similar solutions of the compressible euler equations near a singular point ; the motivation stems from the work carried out in @xcite .",
    "the real gas effects , presented here , are characterized by a van der waals type equation of state .",
    "the analysis presented here predicts several inviscid properties of real gases undergoing shock reflection - diffraction phenomenon ; a summary of the results is presented in the last section .",
    "+ the set - up of the reflection consists of a straight shock hitting a wedge at the origin at time @xmath0 .",
    "the shock is assumed to be weak and moving , parallel to the y - axis , towards the wedge which is placed symmetrically about the flow direction , namely the x - axis , ( figure @xmath1 ) .",
    "the gas ahead of the shock is at rest . since the problem is symmetric with respect to the x - axis , it suffices to consider the problem in the upper half plane outside the half wedge .",
    "+ the basic equations of this study are the euler equations @xmath2 where @xmath3 , ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 denote respectively the density , velocity components , pressure , internal energy , and specific enthalpy , while @xmath7 and @xmath8 are given functions of @xmath3 and @xmath6 which satisfy the thermodynamical constraints @xmath9 with @xmath10 being the temperature , @xmath11 the specific volume and @xmath12 the specific entropy .",
    "we consider the situation when the gas obeys a van der waals equations of state of the form @xmath13 where r is the gas constant , @xmath14 the ratio of specific heats , and @xmath15 the van der waals excluded volume . consider a weak shock hitting a wedge with half angle @xmath16 .",

    "as the shock front hits the wedge head on and propagates further along the wedge , it is reflected by the wedge surface at @xmath42 ( see figure @xmath43 ) , whereas the induced flow behind the incident shock wave is diffracted by the wedge corner at sonic speed .",
    "assuming that the shock reflection is a regular one , the location of the incident shock after it has moved beyond the domain of the influence of the origin ( vertex of the wedge ) is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 ; the straight line segment @xmath46 of the reflected shock is given by @xmath47 the unknown curved portion @xmath48 , due to the influence of the origin , joins the diffracted wavefront smoothly and gives rise the overall shock reflection - diffraction phenomenon . here",

    "+ in view of ( [ equ42 ] ) , ( [ equ44 ] ) , ( [ equ53 ] ) , and ( [ equ88 ] ) , the boundary conditions for ( [ equ85])-([equ86 ] ) can be specified as @xmath384 let @xmath385 be the location of the reflected shock , which is a weak solution of the conservative system ( [ equ85])-([equ86 ] ) .",

    "indeed , at @xmath406 , the reflected shock starts bending and merges asymptotically into the diffracted shock @xmath395 ; however the sonic line @xmath407 is asymptotic to the diffracted shock @xmath395 in the neighborhood of the point @xmath408 ( see figure @xmath409 ) .",
    "+ it may be observed that the streching transformation @xmath410 , @xmath411 , @xmath412 , for every parameter @xmath413 , leaves the equation ( [ equ87 ] ) invariant and , therefore , it admits a similarity solution of the form @xmath414 such that @xmath415 with @xmath416 ; further , as the homogeneous equation ( [ equ96 ] ) admits a solution of the form @xmath417 , an expansion wave solution of ( [ equ87 ] ) in the region @xmath418 between sonic lines @xmath407 and @xmath406 and satisfying the boundary conditions @xmath419 can be written as @xmath420    it may be noticed that an increase in @xmath57 not only causes the sonic lines @xmath421 and @xmath422 to shift along the positive @xmath423 direction , but it also increases the breadth between them ( see figure @xmath409 ) .",
    "further , equation ( [ equ53 ] ) shows that an increase in @xmath57 serves to reduce the jump in the derivatives of flow variables across the expansion wave @xmath418 ; also , a change in the parabolic configuration in figure 4 leads us to reinforce our conclusion that the domain of the elliptic region in the neighborhood of the singular point @xmath408 exhibits an increase with an increase in the van der waals parameter @xmath57 .",
    "in this article , we explore how the real gas effects influence the self - similar solutions of the compressible euler equations .",
    "the regular reflection configuration and the detachment criterion , influenced by the real gas effects , are studied in detail .",
    "a necessary condition is derived for the existence of regular reflection ; the manner in which it is influenced by the shock strength and the van der waals excluded volume , is clearly brought out . in the limit of vanishing van der waals excluded volume ,",
    "the ideal gas case presented in the work of chang and chen @xcite , who studied the problem of shock diffraction along a compressive corner , is recovered .",
    "it is shown that for a regular reflection to take place , there exists a critical value of the angle that the shock velocity vector makes with the shock normal ; it is found that an increase in the shock strength or in the van der waals excluded volume induces an increase in the critical value , implying thereby that an increase either in the shock strength or in the van der waals excluded volume requires the incident angle to be larger , relative to what it would have been in the absence of real gas effects .",
    "we find that the reflected and diffracted regions as well as their boundaries , referred to as wavefronts , are significantly influenced by the real gas effects in the sense that an increase in the van der waals excluded volume fosters an expansion of the linearized solution domain .",
    "as the state behind the reflected shock is not uniform , and the system of governing equations becomes degenerate on the boundary ( referred to as the sonic arc ) , across which there is a continuous transition from the supersonic region to the subsonic region , we look for a uniformly valid asymptotic approximations in the flow field .",
    "following the ideas of weakly nonlinear geometrical acoustics @xcite , we construct weakly nonlinear solutions in these regions and match them with the linearized solution .",
    "it is shown that if the diffracted wave is a rarefaction wave , it gets weakened by the real gas effects and decays slowly as compared to the corresponding ideal gas case . however ,",
    "when the diffracted wave is a shock , we obtain an equation for its asymptotic location , showing thereby that the real gas effects serve to enhance the speed and strength of the diffracted shock wave .",
    "asymptotic expansions are constructed near the singular point , where the @xmath355 approximation ceases to be valid ; these expansions lead to a pair of pdes , which bear a close structural resemblance with the self - similar ( utsd ) equations , analyzed in @xcite .",
    "we obtain an equation for the asymptotic position of a reflected shock in the neighborhood of the singular point , reinforcing our conclusion that the real gas effects engender the real gas boundaries to inflate .",
    "positions of the sonic lines , at which the reflected shock starts bending and the equations change type , are determined . it is shown that the asymptotic system of coupled equations , that hold near the singular point , admits an exact similarity solution ; a rarefaction wave solution , satisfying the specific boundary conditions , is obtained .",
    "it is concluded that the real gas effects serve to weaken the rarefaction wave and to enlarge the diffracted wave region supporting our earlier viewpoint .",
