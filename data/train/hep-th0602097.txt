    "dark energy , or cosmological vacuum energy , spread on every point in space exerts gravitationally smooth and negative pressure and hence leads to cosmic inflation , a phenomenon which is not accounted for by ordinary matter and general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "unfortunately , at the moment the origin of dark energy ( and its associated cosmic acceleration ) is arguably the murkiest question in cosmology - and the one that , when answered , may provide deepest insights into the origin ( and the fate ) of our universe , establishing synergies between the microscopic physics and cosmological length scales .    in recent years",
    ", the cosmic acceleration problem has been addressed in hundreds of papers proposing various kinds of modification of the energy - momentum tensor in the ` vacuum '  the source of gravitationally repulsive negative pressure .",
    "some examples of recent interest include braneworld modifications of einstein s gr  @xcite , scalar - tensor gravity  @xcite , phantom ( ghost ) field  @xcite , k - essence  @xcite or ghost condensate  @xcite , @xmath7-gravity that adds terms proportional to inverse powers of @xmath8  @xcite or @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) terms , or both these effects at once  @xcite , thereby modifying in a very radical manner the einstein s gr itself .",
    "all these proposals typically include a more or less disguised feature , non - locality , other than classical or quantum instabilities .",
    "a recent review by copeland , sami and tsujikawa  @xcite summarizes the prospects and limitations of these proposals in an elegant way .",
    "string theory is much more ambitious and far reaching than any of the above ideas , and it may be compatible with a de sitter universe ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "it has been known that a cosmological compactification of classical supergravity  the low energy description of string / m theory  on compact hyperbolic spaces  @xcite , or ricci - flat twisted spaces  @xcite , naturally leads to a period of cosmic acceleration .",
    "furthermore , fundamental scalar fields abundant in such higher  dimensional gravity theories potentially provide a natural source for gravitationally repulsive vacua , as well as a mechanism for generating the observed density perturbations  @xcite . in this respect , the best framework where one can hope to fully explain the dark energy effect is perhaps string / m theory .",
    "a strong motivation for a cosmology based on string theory  @xcite , that goes beyond the standard cosmology and incorporates einstein s theory in a more general framework , is that it may shed light on the nature of the cosmological singularities arising in gr .",
    "moreover , string theory has the prospect of unification of all other interactions , see  @xcite for a review .",
    "an interesting question is which version of string theory , if any , among the presently known five ( which are related to each other by various dualities  @xcite ) , best describes the physical world .",
    "a successful superstring theory should naturally incorporate realistic cosmological solutions .",
    "string theory , as a theory of quantum gravity in one _ time _ and nine _ space _ dimensions , literally contains ( or predicts ) an infinite number of scalar fields .",
    "most of the scalars in string theory , arising from a compactification to four - dimensions , are structure moduli associated with the ( six - dimensional ) internal geometry of space ( calabi - yau _ spaces _ or calabi - yau _ shapes _ ) , which do not directly couple with the spacetime curvature tensor and hence to einstein gravity  @xcite .",
    "it is well appreciated that , at least , one of the khler moduli ( or the modulus associated with the overall size of the internal compactification manifold ) naturally couples to ( standard ) einstein gravity via riemann curvature invariants  @xcite .    according to conventional wisdom superstrings",
    "involve a minimum length scale only a few order of magnitude larger than the planck length , @xmath11 cm , and , in turn , string theory leads to a modification of einstein s theory only at very short distances .",
    "this idea is perfectly reasonable when we study small fluctuations in the fixed ( time - independent ) background , but may not be generally true , for the scalars such as the dilaton ( @xmath1 ) and the modulus field ( @xmath0 ) and their couplings to various curvature terms , which arise universally in any four - dimensional heterotic superstring model , may be important in any cosmological solution of the string effective action ( see , for example  @xcite ) . in this paper , we therefore investigate as to whether the evolutions of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , and their couplings to a gauss - bonnet term , can explain the cosmic acceleration problem at early ( and/or late ) universe .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly discuss the limitations of a standard cosmological model where einstein s gravity is coupled to a scalar field with a self - interaction potential alone . in section 3",
    "we first motivate ourselves to a more general action which consists of , in addition to a standard scalar potential , scalars dependent loop corrections to the gravitational couplings of the string effective action and write the full set of field equations for the metric , the modulus and the dilaton . in section 4",
    "we first write down the equations of motion as a monotonous system of first order differential equations , and present various analytic solutions by allowing at most two variables of the model to take some specific forms . in section 5",
    ", we do a similar analysis but expressing the field equations in an alternative form , which we find more appropriate for implementing our knowledge about the coupling functions and the behaviour of the accelerating solutions at early or late - times . at the end of both sections 4 and 5",
    "we provide an overview of the different solutions being discussed there . in section 6",
    ", we will have a cursory look in the system where gravity is non - minimally coupled to mater and radiation .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section 7 .",
    "in a standard cosmological scenario , one assumes that for a given scalar field @xmath0 with a self - interaction potential @xmath12 , the einstein gravity is described by the action : @xmath13,\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the inverse planck mass @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the coupling constant and @xmath0 is the classical scalar field whose stress - energy tensor is set by the choice of the potential .",
    "what one normally wants is a well motivated potential for the desired evolution .",
    "this often refers to a cosmological potential that allows at least an epoch of cosmic inflation or acceleration / deceleration regime .",
    "a real motivation for an effective action of the form ( [ action1 ] ) arises from the fact that inflation with the dynamics of a self - interaction potential , @xmath17 , provides a natural mechanism for generating the observed density perturbations  @xcite . to this end",
    ", one defines the spacetime metric in standard friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) form : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the scale factor of the universe .",
    "the hubble parameter that measures the expansion rate of the universe is given by @xmath20 , where the dot denotes a derivative with respect to proper time @xmath21 .",
    "one also assumes that the scalar field @xmath0 obeys an equation of state ( eos ) , with an equation of state parameter given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the deceleration parameter .",
    "this definition of @xmath24 does not depend on the number of ( scalar ) fields in the model .",
    "the ` equation of state ' parameter @xmath24 is essentially a measure of how squishy the substance is .",
    "it is when @xmath25 a gravitationally repulsive pressure exerted by one or more scalar fields can drive the universe into an accelerating phase ( @xmath26 ) . in particular , the cosmological constant @xmath27",
    "as a source of dark energy or vacuum energy means that @xmath28 .    in the last two decades",
    ", many authors have studied cosmology based on ( [ action1 ] ) by considering various _",
    "ad hoc _ choice of the scalar potential @xmath12 ( the recent reviews  @xcite provide an exhaustive list of references ) .",
    "written in terms of the following dimensionless variables : @xmath29 the field equations , obtained by varying the action ( [ action1 ] ) , satisfy the following simple relationships  @xcite : @xmath30 the time - evolution of the scalar field is given by @xmath31^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "clearly , the model lacks its predictability , since @xmath32 ( and hence @xmath33 ) is arbitrary .",
    "this arbitrariness in the potential has motivated many physicists / cosmologists to consider models with some specific choices of the potential , e.g. quadratic / chaotic potential @xmath34 , power - law potential @xmath35 , inverse power - law potential @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) , the axion - potential @xmath38 , etc .",
    "this approach to the problem , starting from linde s model of chaotic inflation  @xcite , may be motivated from different particle physics models or effective field theory . without a complete theory of fundamental gravity ,",
    "the validity of these potentials ( to explain the dark energy problem ) is not clear .",
    "the choice of possibilities for the potential also mimics the fact that the exact nature and origin of an inflationary potential ( or dark energy ) has not been convincingly explained yet .    a common ( if not conservative ) argument sometimes expressed in the literature is the following .",
    "to explain a particular value of one new parameter ( acceleration , i.e. , the second derivative of the scale factor , @xmath39 ) , it is enough to introduce another new parameter in the set up of the model .",
    "to this aim , one often fixes the time dependence of the scale factor , by making a particular _ anstz _ for it , which then fixes the parameter @xmath32 , and then finally find a potential , using ( [ def - nogb])-([solution1 ] ) , which supports this particular @xmath19 .",
    "for instance , for the power - law expansion , @xmath40 , such a potential is given by @xmath41 .",
    "in this fashion one may find a good approximation at each energy scale , but the corresponding solution may have little relevance when one attempts to study a wider range of scales , including an early inflationary epoch .",
    "action ( [ action1 ] ) is remarkably simple but not sufficiently general as it excludes , for example , the coupling between the field @xmath0 ( a run away khler modulus ) and the riemann curvature invariants , as predicted correctly by some version of string theory  @xcite .",
    "also the best motivated scalar - tensor theories which respect most of gr s symmetries naturally include the gb type curvature invariants multiplied by field dependent couplings .",
    "that is to say , the most general scalar - tensor theories may involve one more parameter , the gb integrand multiplied by a non - trivial function of @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "one may wonder whether such extra degree of freedom added to the standard model ruins the theory , leading to a plethora of both qualitative and analytic behaviour of cosmological solutions .",
    "this is generally not the case ; the knowledge about the @xmath0 ( and/or @xmath1)-dependent couplings may even help to construct a realistic cosmological model with time - varying @xmath32 ( which otherwise remains arbitrary ) without destroying the basic characteristics of the standard model ( [ action1 ] ) .",
    "string theory gives rise to two kinds of modifications of the einstein s theory .",
    "the first one is associated with the contribution of an infinite tower of massive string modes and leads to @xmath42-corrections , and the second one is due to quantum loop effects ( string coupling expansion )  @xcite .",
    "therefore , if we wish a cosmological model to inherit maximum properties of the low energy string effective action and its associated early universe cosmology , then it may be necessary to include an additional scalar , namely , the dilaton field @xmath1 , which plays the role of string loop expansion parameter .",
    "to this aim , the effective action for the system may be taken to be  @xcite @xmath43 { \\cal r}^2_{gb } \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the gauss - bonnet ( gb ) integrand .",
    "it is assumed that there is no potential term corresponding to the field @xmath1 .",
    "the gb term @xmath45 has been multiplied by non - trivial functions of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , otherwise it would remain a topological invariant in four dimensions .",
    "one would expect @xmath45 to be small in the present epoch and that mass scales associated with the dilaton and the modulus to be smaller than @xmath46 , so that they would not be dominating the dynamics . only when these two conditions are met , can the higher - derivative corrections to the action be neglected and does string theory go over to an effective quantum field theory  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we will consider for most of this paper that @xmath47 , @xmath48 , so that both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are canonical ( real ) scalar fields .",
    "it is worth noting that a gb integrand multiplied by a function of @xmath1 is already present at the string tree - level in the next to leading - order @xmath42 expansion  @xcite , and a non - trivial @xmath49 exists at the one - loop order  @xcite .",
    "one also notes that the ( semi)classical tests of newtonian gravity typically deal with small fluctuations in the fixed ( time - independent ) background and thus are unaffected by the gb type modification of einstein s theory .",
    "another beauty of the action ( [ dilatongb2 ] ) is that the equations of motion for the modulus - dilaton - graviton system form a set differential equations with no more than second derivatives of the fields or the metric , which can be solved exactly with some specific choice of the ( coupling ) parameters , or _ a prior _ knowledge about the evolution of one of the scalars , and/or the scale factor , @xmath19 .    as compared to the four - dimensional perturbative string effective action obtained from a compactification of 10d heterotic superstring on a symmetric orbifold  @xcite , action ( [ dilatongb2 ] )",
    "lacks the terms proportional to @xmath50 ( where @xmath51 and @xmath52 a totally anti - symmetric tensor ) which however give a trivial contribution in the background ( [ bg - metric ] ) .",
    "the numerical coefficient @xmath3 typically depends on the massless spectrum of every particular model ; in  @xcite , it was found to be associated with the four - dimensional trace anomaly of the @xmath53 supersymmetry of the theory .",
    "here we absorb this coefficient into the coupling function @xmath49 .",
    "an often asked question is the following : what are the choices for @xmath12 , @xmath49 and @xmath54 ) ? and",
    "what could motivate these choices ?",
    "one can take a different point of view : it may be more productive to know what form of the potential ( or the scalar - gb couplings ) offers the best resolution to the dilemma posed by the current cosmic acceleration or the dark energy problem . in some perturbative string amplitude computations",
    ", @xmath12 appeared to be absent  @xcite , implying that it is a phenomenologically - motivated term . whatever the origin of the potential , @xmath12 , in ( [ dilatongb2 ] ) may be , we believe that the @xmath0-dependence of the potential is quite universal .",
    "this was also the case revealed recently from type iib string theory compactified on a ( deformed ) conifold  @xcite ; this study also includes some supersymmetry breaking non - perturbative effects , mainly those coming from different branes and fluxes present in the extra dimensions .",
    "typically , the moduli potentials are generated by fluxes , so @xmath12 in ( [ dilatongb2 ] ) may take into account a contribution from fluxes .",
    "recently , @xcite examined a cosmological solution for the system  ( [ dilatongb2 ] ) with the simplest choice of the scalar potential and the modulus - gb coupling , namely @xmath55 , deleting the @xmath1-dependent terms .",
    "even this simple system led to plethora of qualitative behaviors of cosmological solutions , among which one may accommodate lots of data , including the dark energy s ` equation of state ' parameter , @xmath24 .",
    "however , a solution of the type @xmath56 with @xmath57 , or @xmath58 with @xmath59 , i.e. a power - law expansion for which @xmath60 const , does not support the transition from acceleration to deceleration as well as the crossing between quintessence ( @xmath6 ) to phantom ( @xmath4 ) phases .",
    "a non - constant @xmath32 is generally required for achieving a natural exit from inflation in the early universe cosmology as well as for explaining a transition from deceleration to acceleration in the expansion of the ( late ) universe , which has been viewed as a recent phenomenon  @xcite .",
    "thus we shall normally consider a situation in which @xmath32 ( and hence the eos parameter , @xmath61 ) dynamically changes as it happens in inflationary cosmology .",
    "a study has been recently made in  @xcite by considering a variant of the action  ( [ dilatongb2 ] ) , which includes additional @xmath1-dependent higher curvature terms and also a non - trivial coupling between @xmath1 and the einstein - hilbert term , i.e. in the presence of a single scalar field ( a dilaton or compactification modulus ) .",
    "the method authors used there to find the solutions was mainly to identify analytically some asymptotic solutions and then try to join them numerically .",
    "a similar approach was taken previously in the paper  @xcite , for the action ( [ dilatongb2 ] ) with @xmath62 ( @xcite provided further generalizations with a non - zero spatial curvature ) . in this work ,",
    "we examine the system analytically , by writing the field equations as a monotonous system of first ( and second ) order differential equations . in the background",
    "( [ bg - metric ] ) , the equations of motion derived from the action  ( [ dilatongb2 ] ) are given by ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath63 where @xmath64 .",
    "note that @xmath65 const is a solution of the last equation above only if @xmath66 const , implying a trivial coupling between @xmath1 and the gb term .",
    "because of the bianchi identity , one of the equations is redundant and may be discarded , as it will be trivially satisfied by a solution obtained by solving three equations only : equations ( [ gb1 ] ) and ( [ gb2 ] ) are not functionally independent .",
    "more precisely , the linear combination @xmath67 yields the time derivative of ( 7 ) .",
    "one may drop , for instance , ( 8) , so that ( 7 ) , ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) form a set of independent equations of motion .    in  @xcite , we analysed the model by treating @xmath1 as a constant , which then leaves only @xmath0 as a dynamical field .",
    "this analysis was partly motivated from an earlier observation by antoniadis et al .",
    "@xcite , in the @xmath62 case , that the behaviour of solutions depends crucially on the form of @xmath0-dependent string one - loop corrections , while the @xmath1-dependent contribution is negligible and may be ignored .",
    "this has got another clear motivation : in string theory context , fixing of the volume ( or khler ) moduli , is only an approximate idea ( see , e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "we are not interested in the situation where the contributions coming from the gb term dominates the other terms in the effective action , which is consistent with our approximation of neglecting higher derivative terms , like @xmath68 and also higher curvature terms .",
    "for all solutions to be discussed below , the squared of the hubble parameter , @xmath69 , will decay faster than the couplings @xmath54 and @xmath49 grow with time .",
    "thus the moduli / dilaton dependent two ( and higher ) loop corrections to higher derivative terms or terms higher than quadratic in the riemann tensor , which give at least sixth powers of @xmath70 , are small and may be neglected . nevertheless , it is interesting to note that a four - dimensional string effective action without a gauss - bonnet term , but including terms up to quartic in @xmath0 , @xmath68 , give rise to solutions supporting inflation and/or dark energy universe .",
    "there also exist models where an accelerated expansion can be realized without a field potential ; some examples are the k - inflation and dilatonic ghost condensate  @xcite .",
    "we study here a model without matter couplings ; only the matters that are present in a fundamental theory such as a string / m theory arise from the decay of the fields , like @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in the last section , however , we will have a cursory look in the system where @xmath1 is coupled ( non-)minimally to ordinary matter and radiation .",
    "let us define the following dimensionless variables : @xmath71 in terms of these variables , equations ( [ gb1])-([gb4 ] ) take the following form ( see the appendix for details ) @xmath72 where the prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the number of e - folds .",
    "we also note that @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "in our discussion we normally assume that the scale factor of the universe before inflation is @xmath77 , so initially , @xmath78 . at late times",
    ", one has @xmath79 , since @xmath80 .",
    "however , this assumption may just be reversed , especially , if one wishes to apply the model to study a late - time cosmology , where one normalizes the scale factor such that its present value is @xmath77 , which then implies that @xmath81 in the past , since @xmath82 .    in a known example of heterotic string compactification  @xcite , one defines , to leading order in string loop expansions , @xmath83 and @xmath84 ; the latter implies that @xmath85 and hence @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) for @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) . for other choice of @xmath54",
    ", @xmath49 can be different .",
    "for this reason , as well as for generality , we would prefer to keep both @xmath54 and @xmath49 arbitrary . at any rate",
    ", the scalar gb couplings of the above forms may be realized as special limits of a more general class of solutions discussed in this paper .",
    "first we note that the system of equations ( [ eq1a])-([eq4a ] ) may be expressed broadly into the following two categories ( branches ) : @xmath90 for @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is an integration constant , and @xmath93 for @xmath94 . in the first case , for",
    "@xmath95 , the time variation of @xmath1 is exponentially suppressed , @xmath96 .",
    "below we present a number of interesting cosmological solutions ( as well as construct inflationary potentials ) , by considering some _ a prior _ information about the evolution of one of the scalar fields and/or the scale factor .",
    "our discussions also generalize past investigations in the literature where comparison is possible .",
    "if we drop the @xmath0-dependent terms , then we find @xmath97 as the set of two independent equations .",
    "it is not difficult to see that @xmath98 which decreases faster than @xmath99 can lead to an accelerated expansion , that is , @xmath100 .",
    "note that in general @xmath73 depends on the field @xmath1 , and its first time derivative , @xmath101 ( or @xmath98 ) .",
    "however , if the slow roll - condition @xmath102 is satisfied at a particular epoch , then in that epoch @xmath73 primarily depends on the field value .",
    "the simplest anstz is @xmath103 const .",
    "then we find @xmath104 where @xmath105 .",
    "for a canonical @xmath1 ( @xmath48 ) , this solution does not give a cosmic acceleration .",
    "for instance , in an inflationary model motivated by brane worlds , one may consider a modified anstz : @xmath106 ; here @xmath107 may characterize the minimum separation between two moving branes .",
    "hence @xmath108 where @xmath109 .",
    "the universe accelerates for @xmath110 .",
    "of course , one may solve the system of equations  ( [ no - sigma - terms ] ) by making an even more complicated anstz , such as @xmath111 , which may motivated , for example , by some domain wall solutions .",
    "the two examples that we discussed above are of simpler kind .",
    "if we drop all @xmath1-dependent terms or simply consider a constant dilaton background , then we find @xmath112 first , as is often the case in most inflationary models , satisfying slow - roll conditions , we shall assume that @xmath113 const .",
    "then there exist two classes of solutions : the first class of solutions is characterized by @xmath114 where @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "these are nothing but the gb coupling and the scalar potential considered , for instance , in  @xcite ; such terms may be generated also using the formalism discussed in  @xcite ) .",
    "the second class of solution may be characterized by the potential @xmath117 where the hubble parameter is a solution of the differential equation : @xmath118 especially , for the power - law expansion , @xmath119 , or equivalently @xmath120 , we find @xmath121 where @xmath122 $ ] , and @xmath123 and @xmath124 are arbitrary constants .",
    "unlike result ( [ nojiri - type ] ) , the gb coupling is now a sum of two exponential terms .",
    "in fact , alternatively , one can solve the equations ( [ only - sigma - eqs ] ) by making reasonable _ anstzes _ for two of the variables ; in particular , for @xmath125 and @xmath126 , we find @xmath127 , where @xmath128 and @xmath129 take the sign of @xmath130 and @xmath131 , respectively .",

    "generally , @xmath1 ( the spin-@xmath394 partner of spin-@xmath468 graviton ) is coupled to einstein term and thus , while going from string frame to einstein frame , it may also couple to matter fields . in the heterotic string theory studied by antoniadis , gava and narain  @xcite , there is no coupling between the field @xmath0 and the ricci - scalar term , so @xmath0 couples to gravity only via spacetime curvature tensors or riemann curvature invariants .",

    "we can practically drop the @xmath485 term , at late times , since most of the radiation energy in the universe is in the cosmic microwave background , which makes up a fraction of roughly @xmath486 of the total density of the universe .    in the case @xmath473",

    "one may be more concerned here with a time - variation of the ( common ) modulus @xmath0 .",
    "we take @xmath509 as a conservative case , for which @xmath12 is also constant ( cf equation  ( [ stab - nonzerov ] ) ) . because of phenomenological reasons it is desirable that the rolling of @xmath0 is small , especially after inflation , which then allows only a slow rolling of the potential . instead of the condition @xmath509",

    "has been known that even if the tests of general relativity in the solar system ( and binary pulsars ) set strong constraints on scalar - tensor models of the type considered in this paper , they may differ significantly from gr at high red - shift , @xmath512  @xcite , possibly affecting the standard scenario of structure formation . in turn , the scalar - gb couplings , in addition to the matter - dilaton coupling , may be constrained only by taking into account cosmological and solar - system data together  @xcite ) .",
    "such results are not known yet ; see also the recent paper  @xcite which discusses on cosmological and astrophysical constraints of gauss - bonnet dark energy .    for @xmath513 and @xmath514",
    ", one has @xmath515 ( cf equation  ( [ gb4-new ] ) ) ; with the large scale factor , the rolling of @xmath1 can be small .",
    "in fact , the universe has merely doubled in its size between radiation domination era ( @xmath516 ) and today ( @xmath517 ) or @xmath518 , where @xmath519 is the red - shift factor .",
    "so , unless we do not demand a large number of e - folds ( between radiation domination and present eras ) , we find no reason to expect a large shift in @xmath1 , since @xmath520 .",
    "it may well be that the field @xmath1 has evolved by a small amount ; provided @xmath521 , or more mildly @xmath522  @xcite , for today s value of @xmath1 , any possible violation of equivalence principle ( or deviations from the standard general relativity ) may be small enough to easily satisfy all cosmological constraints .",
    "in this paper , we explored the cosmological implications of the modulus - dilaton dependent one - loop corrections to the gravitational coupling of the heterotic string effective action , by presenting various exact cosmological solutions .",
    "these corrections comprise a gb invariant multiplied by universal non - trivial function of the common modulus field @xmath0 and the dilaton field @xmath1 , and thus they may have an important role in explaining inflation , as well as the recently discovered acceleration of the cosmic expansion .",
    "the solutions represent a flat four - dimensional frw spacetime where the hubble expansion parameter is a smoothly decreasing function of the number of e - folds , @xmath73 , while remaining non - zero at all times . as such",
    ", they exhibit the type of branch - changing solution , i.e. , deceleration / acceleration regime , that is a prerequisite for the successful incorporation of the early inflation as well as the currently observed deceleration / acceleration phase in the expansion of the ( late ) universe .",
    "the main purpose of this paper was to point out the importance of @xmath42-corrections for explaining the cosmic acceleration problem attributed to `` dark energy '' or gravitational vacuum energy .",
    "it may well be that the evolution of a cosmological ( frw ) background from the string perturbative vacuum leads to a regime of cosmic inflation in which the strengths of the coupling constants associated with the string loop effects can grow with time , though very slowly , while the higher curvature contributions to the effective action are more suppressed than the ricci scalar .",
    "when both the common modulus filed ( @xmath0 ) and the dilaton ( @xmath1 ) take almost constant values at late - times , the model reduces to a standard picture .",
    "we demonstrated that , both for slowly running dilaton phase and constant dilaton phase of the standard scenario , the model can lead to a small deviation from the @xmath156 prediction of non - evolving dark energy ; some of the branches , specifically when the parameter @xmath3 in the one - loop effective action is negative ( or @xmath523 ) can support a non - standard ( phantom ) cosmology ( @xmath4 ) , while the other branches support a standard cosmology with no - acceleration ( @xmath405 ) or acceleration ( @xmath524 ) or deceleration ( @xmath159 ) .    in our analysis",
    ", we have assumed that there is no potential for the dilaton in the loop - corrected perturbative string effective action .",
    "however , it is quite possible that for the formulation of a complete and realistic string cosmology scenario , one needs to take into account the quantum back reactions of loops and radiation as well as an appropriate non - perturbative dilaton potential .",
    "we assumed that in our model the contributions arising from two ( and higher ) loop terms are suppressed as compared to those from one - loop terms . in this sense , the result discussed above may persist in the full theory under certain assumptions about the moduli dependence of loop corrections to higher derivative terms .",
    "a key point is that a field dependent ( and thus space - time dependent ) gb coupling , which is completely reasonable in the four - dimensional effective action , can make the observability of various cosmological parameters , including the hubble expansion rate of the universe , more achievable .    a more detailed analysis of the model , mainly by introducing matter fields , is needed yet , first indications are that a gb - type modification of gravity is a healthy proposal for explaining the cosmic acceleration problem .",

    "<S> in this paper , we fully investigate the cosmological effects of the moduli - dependent one - loop corrections to the gravitational couplings of the string effective action to explain the cosmic acceleration problem in early ( and/or late ) universe . these corrections comprise a gauss - bonnet ( gb ) invariant multiplied by universal non - trivial functions of the common modulus @xmath0 and the dilaton @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the model exhibits several features of cosmological interest , including the transition between deceleration and acceleration phases . by considering some phenomenologically motivated ansatzs for one of the scalars and/or the scale factor ( of the universe ) , </S>",
    "<S> we also construct a number of interesting inflationary potentials . </S>",
    "<S> in all examples under consideration , we find that the model leads only to a standard inflation ( @xmath2 ) when the numerical coefficient @xmath3 associated with modulus - gb coupling is positive , while the model can lead also to a non - standard inflation ( @xmath4 ) , if @xmath3 is negative . in the absence of ( or </S>",
