    "<S> in this work we systematically investigate the condensate properties , superfluid properties and quantum phase transitions in interacting bose gases trapped in disordered optical potentials . </S>",
    "<S> we numerically solve the bose - hubbard hamiltonian exactly for different : ( a ) types of disorder , ( b ) disorder strengths , and ( c ) interatomic interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the three types of disorder studied are : quasiperiodic disorder , uniform random disorder and random speckle - type disorder . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the bose glass , as identified by fisher  _ et al . </S>",

    "<S> b * 40 * , 546 ( 1989 ) ] , contains a normal condensate component and we show how the three different factors listed above affect it .    the properties of bose systems can be strongly affected by interatomic interactions and disorder . in the noninteracting case disorder </S>",
    "<S> leads to the insulating anderson localization  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if interatomic interactions are also present , the interplay between the interactions and disorder can lead to a rich and complex arrangement of different quantum phases  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is even possible for states to develop where the bec ( bose - einstein condensate ) fraction is non - superfluid  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our work has two major goals . </S>",
    "<S> the first is to show that the normal fluid bec found by huang and meng  @xcite and giorgini  _ et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite can be identified with the bose glass insulating state found by fisher  _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _  @xcite . using the tight - binding bose - hubbard lattice model , fisher  _ et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite were able to describe an insulating state in disordered lattices which exists due to the cooperative effect of repulsive interactions and disorder . </S>",
    "<S> this ` bose glass ' ( bg ) is gapless and compressible . </S>",
    "<S> taking an alternative approach with a microscopic low - density model involving a dilute low - temperature hard - sphere gas with random scatterers in the limit of weak disorder , huang and meng  @xcite and giorgini  _ et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite found that the superfluid is more depleted by the disorder than the condensate . </S>",
    "<S> that is , there exists _ bec without superfluidity_.    it was shown previously using the disordered bose - hubbard model that it is possible to obtain a normal condensate fraction for certain parameters  @xcite and that there is a normal condensate fraction in the bose glass phase for quasiperiodic disorder  @xcite . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we show that the parameter regime where this occurs can be identified with the bg region described by fisher  _ et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite by showing that the bg phase and the normal condensate phase occur together as we change the interaction strength , disorder strength and the _ type _ of disorder . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that in the bg regime the spatial correlations go to zero with distance but remain significant over multiple lattice sites .    </S>",
    "<S> our second goal is to show how the properties of ` dirty ' bose gases change with : ( a ) the type of disorder , ( b ) the disorder strength , and ( c ) the interatomic interaction strength , especially with respect to the existence of condensate without superfluidity . </S>",
    "<S> we show that there are significant differences in the phase diagram as we change the type of disorder and the nature of the differences depend on the type of disorder .    </S>",
    "<S> to date the majority of the work on ` dirty ' bosons has focused on liquid @xmath0he in porous materials such as vycor glass or aerogel  @xcite . in recent years however , weakly - interacting dilute bose gases , especially those trapped in optical dipole potentials , have become increasingly important in this field  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . an important advantage of these systems is their flexibility and their ease of control over important experimental parameters . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen in recent experiments in which a variety of different types of disordered optical potentials of controllable strength were studied e.g. , quasiperiodic lattices  @xcite , speckle potentials  @xcite , and lattices with superimposed disorder  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these recent experimental developments make an exploration of how condensate and superfluid properties change with the properties of the disorder increasingly relevant . </S>",
    "<S> another advantage of these systems over @xmath1he is that bec without superfluidity only occurs in very dilute systems  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the many - body quantum state for _ n _ interacting bosons in a 1d lattice with @xmath2 lattice sites can be described using the 1d bose - hubbard ( bh ) hamiltonian , @xmath3 @xmath4 , @xmath5 are the boson creation and annihilation operators respectively at the _ </S>",
    "<S> i-_th lattice site . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 . _ j _ is the strength of tunnelling between neighboring sites and _ u _ the strength of the on - site interatomic interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the values of _ j _ and _ u _ can be calculated as in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath7 is the on - site single particle energy at site _ </S>",
    "<S> i_.    the bh hamiltonian  ( [ eqbhh ] ) can be solved numerically by diagonalization in the occupation number basis . </S>",
    "<S> the large size of this basis , restricts the @xmath8 and @xmath9 that can be handled using diagonalization . </S>",
    "<S> however , diagonalization solves eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqbhh ] ) in a numerically exact and transparent way . as will be seen , even in our finite systems , </S>",
    "<S> significant differences can be seen as the type of disorder , the disorder strength and the interaction strength change .    </S>",
    "<S> significantly , we do not make the assumption that the condensate fraction , @xmath10 and the superfluid fraction , @xmath11 are the same but instead define the two separately following the definitions used in  @xcite and  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath12 can be calculated from the response of the system to a very small phase variation , @xmath13 , across the lattice . as long as @xmath14 is small , </S>",
    "<S> the increase in energy is due solely to the kinetic energy of the superflow . assuming that the phase variation is linear , @xmath15 in terms of the bh coefficients  @xcite . instead of using twisted boundary conditions </S>",
    "<S> , it is easier to use a unitary transformation to make a ` twisted hamiltonian ' and use periodic boundary conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> however bec is not defined in terms of transport properties but as pointed out by penrose and onsager from the properties of the one - body density matrix  @xcite . following this , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 is taken to be the largest eigenvalue of the single - particle density matrix for the ground state @xmath17 , @xmath18 , divided by @xmath9 , the total number of atoms . </S>",
    "<S> however , because of finite size effects , the restriction @xmath19 exists . due to the 1d nature of the system </S>",
    "<S> this is not a true condensate . </S>",
    "<S> however the physical similarity between the definition of @xmath16 here and true condensate and the finite size of the system means that it should still be useful to consider what happens in 1d .     </S>",

    "<S> it is assumed that the lattice is deep enough that disorder with strength @xmath25 _ only _ alters @xmath7 significantly  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath26 obviously represents a homogeneous single - periodic lattice . for uniform random disorder @xmath7 </S>",
    "<S> varies flatly as @xmath27 [ see figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figpotsamples](b ) and ( e ) ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the definition of @xmath25 for speckle - type disorder is different as there is no upper bound for @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> a speckle distribution can be created experimentally by scattering laser light from a rough surface . </S>",
    "<S> this results in a random potential that obeys the probability distribution ,  @xcite [ see figs .  [ </S>",
    "<S> figpotsamples](c ) and ( f ) ] where @xmath28 in this context denotes a mean . </S>",
    "<S> we model the speckle numerically using the method outlined in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> following recent experiments we define @xmath29 , where @xmath23 is the standard deviation of @xmath24  @xcite . for a speckle , @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that by using the bh hamiltonian ( [ eqbhh ] ) , physically what is being modelled is not the speckle potential alone but the speckle plus an optical lattice .    </S>",
    "<S> quasiperiodic disorder is different from the other types of disorder in that it is not random but rather , completely deterministic . </S>",
    "<S> it can be created by superimposing two _ incommensurate _ lattices ( that is , the ratio of the periodicities is irrational ) . assuming that one lattice is much weaker than the other , the weaker lattice can be considered a disordered perturbation that shifts the well - depths of the first lattice and hence @xmath7 by at most @xmath25 [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figpotsamples](a ) ] . under these circumstances </S>",
    "<S> the quasiperiodic potential can be represented in the bh hamiltonian ( [ eqbhh ] ) by @xmath20 where @xmath31 is irrational and @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath32 here enumerates the lattice sites . </S>",
    "<S> comparing quasiperiodic disorder to random disorder is important as recent experiments have used quasiperiodic disorder to approximate uniform random disorder  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> for the uniform random disorder and the speckle - type disorder the results shown are the average of 24 samples . </S>",

    "<S> [ figcontour ] shows how @xmath33 , @xmath16 , @xmath12 and @xmath34 change with : ( 1 ) the type of disorder , ( 2 ) the strength of the disorder @xmath25 , and ( 3 ) the interatomic interactions @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath25 and @xmath40 are both scaled by the tunnelling strength @xmath37 . @xmath38 and @xmath41 for each sample and for the two random types of disorder the average of 24 samples is taken . </S>",
    "<S> for the quasiperiodic disorder we use @xmath42 .    </S>",
    "<S> the zero disorder line ( @xmath43 ) represents the homogeneous periodic lattice . as @xmath36 increases , the system undergoes a sf - mi ( superfluid - mott insulator ) transition . </S>",
    "<S> the mi is characterized here by : integer filling @xmath44 ( for our parameters @xmath45 ) , suppression of the number fluctuations @xmath46 , a finite energy gap , @xmath47 and @xmath16 going to @xmath48 .    in the non - interacting case ( @xmath49 ) </S>",
    "<S> , disorder causes the atoms to become anderson localized . </S>",
    "<S> this is characterised by the exponential spatial localization of the atoms and @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 is trivially equal to one here .     </S>",

    "<S> . however , for strong enough disorder and moderate interactions @xmath11 is still zero or close to zero but the other properties of the state are different from that of a mi in a homogeneous lattice . </S>",
    "<S> one difference is in the @xmath44 [ e.g. see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figsamplespecklepot](b ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> however , the most clear difference can be seen in the energy gap [ figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figcontour](a ) , ( e ) and ( i ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> a bose glass in a disordered interacting boson system is a _ gapless _ </S>",
    "<S> compressible insulator  @xcite . in comparison </S>",
    "<S> a mi is an incompressible insulator _ with a gap _ which occurs for large enough @xmath36 and commensurate filling  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a finite size system always has a discrete excitation spectrum and hence it is impossible to have @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> however , in this region @xmath33 is very small and many times weaker than the energy gap in the mi which reaches values of @xmath54 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figcontour ] . in the mi , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath33 increases linearly with @xmath36 so this is not likely to be its maximum value . </S>",
    "<S> thus in the transition from the mott insulator to this region the energy gap can be said to effectively disappear . </S>",
    "<S> hence this region matches fisher  _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ s description of the bose glass  @xcite .    as figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figcontour](d ) , ( h ) and ( l ) show , in both the superfluid and the mi regions there are no significant differences between @xmath16 and @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> however in the bg region it is clear that though @xmath16 is depleted it is significantly greater than @xmath12 . in the bg , _ there exists condensate without superfluidity_. close to the mi or the superfluid regions , @xmath55 $ ] gradually decreases . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , condensate without superfluidity can be identified with the bose glass .    </S>",
    "<S> _ both _ repulsive interactions and disorder are necessary for bg . however , if @xmath56 the system becomes a mi . as can be seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figcontour ] , as @xmath25 increases the critical @xmath40 required for the bg - mi quantum phase transition increases . </S>",
    "<S> this means that in disordered lattices using very strong disorder will increase the size of the parameter regime where it is possible to obtain bg and hence condensate without superfluidity .    </S>",
    "<S> the results above apply to all three types of disorder studied . </S>",
    "<S> however significant differences exist between the different types of disorder . </S>",
    "<S> first , the changes in @xmath12 and @xmath16 have a distinct complex lobe - like structure in the quasiperiodic case . </S>",
    "<S> this has been observed previously for quasiperiodic disorder and attributed to the non - random nature of the quasiperiodic distribution and the sensitivity of rearrangements of the many - body wavefunction to the distribution of @xmath51  @xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> ( color online ) the spatial correlations @xmath57 between sites @xmath32 and @xmath58 ( with periodic boundary conditions ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath59 shows @xmath60 . </S>",

    "<S> ( f ) is for the quasiperiodic lattice in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figcontour ] . </S>",
    "<S> all examples are for @xmath50.,width=325 ]    another major difference exists between bounded ( quasiperiodic and uniform random ) and unbounded ( speckle ) disorder . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figcontour ] shows that for the same @xmath35 using unbounded rather than bounded disorder greatly increases the size of the bg region . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figcontour ] shows the average over many samples . examining individual speckle samples </S>",
    "<S> shows the largest bg regions occur when there are  spikes \" where @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> these inevitably occur due to the unbounded nature of the speckle distribution . </S>",
    "<S> an example of one such speckle sample with a  spike \" is given in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figsamplespecklepot ] which clearly shows the enlarged bg region .    </S>",
    "<S> studying individual samples also allows us to examine the spatial correlations which are given by the off - diagonal terms of the one - body density matrix , . </S>",
    "<S> we let @xmath62 and use periodic boundary conditions ; @xmath59 is thus simply @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> figs .  </S>",

    "<S> [ figsamplespecklepot ] . fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figdensitymatrix](f ) is for the quasiperiodic disorder in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figcontour ] . </S>",
    "<S> all examples are for @xmath50 .    in the non - interacting case [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figdensitymatrix](a ) ] ( anderson localization ) , the wavefunction is strongly localized . for @xmath56 ( mott insulator ) , @xmath45 for every lattice site regardless of @xmath7 [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figdensitymatrix](e ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> no correlations exist between lattice sites ; each site is independent .    in the bg , </S>",
    "<S> the density distribution is much more homogeneous compared to the noninteracting case . unlike the mi , the bg retains significant correlations between lattice sites . as @xmath63 increases @xmath57 decreases but remains significant over a finite area . </S>",
    "<S> this also occurs in other disorder samples though the exact details depend greatly on the topology of the sample . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figdensitymatrix](f ) shows an example for quasiperiodic disorder . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath10 is significantly greater than @xmath11 in the bg region , it is possible to consider this a localized homogeneous condensate pinned by the disorder . </S>",
    "<S> the identification with the bg hints at the possible structure of the quantum phase though it remains to be seen if these results apply to larger systems .    as @xmath36 increases the spatial correlations between sites disappears . </S>",
    "<S> however it is possible that in a true speckle potential ( without a lattice ) the increasing fragmentation of the condensate which can be observed here with increasing interaction strength may not occur due to the absence of a mi phase . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative is using noninteger @xmath64 as previously studied in disordered lattices  @xcite .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> we have shown how superfluid and condensate properties change in ` dirty ' bose gases as interatomic interactions , disorder strength and the type of disorder are varied . </S>",
    "<S> we showed that in a disordered lattice , the bose glass as identified by the lack of superfluidity and energy gap , comprises of a bec without superfluidity . in order to maximise the size of the parameter regime where it is possible to obtain bec which is part of the normal fluid either the strength of the disorder </S>",
    "<S> can be increased or an unbounded disorder can be used . by examining the spatial correlations between lattice sites in the different insulating states we found that the bose glass may be considered a localized homogeneous condensate pinned by disorder . </S>"
