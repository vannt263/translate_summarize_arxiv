    "astrophysical and cosmological observations provide compelling evidence that about 85% of all the matter in the universe is in the form of dark matter ( dm ) , an elusive substance which is currently searched for with a variety of observational and experimental channels at colliders , in underground detectors , or via indirect signals from dm annihilation or decay @xcite .",
    "cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy and polarization data provide interesting constraints on the properties of dm particles  @xcite .",
    "secondary particles injected via dm annihilation ( or decay ) after recombination , around redshift @xmath3 , would in fact inevitably affect the recombination history of the universe and widen the surface of last scattering , which is tightly constrained by cmb observations as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , and more recently in refs .",
    "possible effects on the cosmological recombination spectrum were discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one of the main reasons of interest for these constraints is that , in contrast with other indirect searches , they do not rely on knowledge of astrophysical dm structures , affected by the complex aspects of non - linear gravity as well as complicated feedback due to baryons  @xcite .",
    "the cmb probe is thus as reliable as the description of the basic atomic and nuclear / particle physics processes involved is .",
    "the robustness ( and astrophysical independence ) of the cmb constraints motivates further efforts to assess and improve the error budget .",
    "the degree of sophistication in modeling the atomic processes down to the recombination stage is quite elevated and has also seen recent improvements , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "here we revise one aspect related to the accuracy of the nuclear / particle physics part .",
    "it is typically assumed that protons are highly penetrating and poor at transferring energy to the intergalactic medium ( igm )  a misnomer , since no galaxies have formed at such high redshifts  and their energy release to the medium is neglected  @xcite ( see however the comment in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this article , we estimate the additional energy released to the gas by the interactions of the high - energy protons and antiprotons formed among dm annihilation final states .",
    "this article is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "[ processes ] we review the basic physics substantiating the two points above . in sec .",
    "[ computation ] we describe our computational technique and present our results in sec .",
    "[ results ] . finally , in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] we conclude .",
    "protons and antiprotons carry a significant fraction of the overall energy emitted in dm annihilations into quarks , gluons or weak gauge bosons .",
    "typically , this amounts to @xmath4% of the energy channelled into @xmath5 and @xmath2 s , see for example fig .",
    "4 in  @xcite , and a fraction of this energy will be inevitably transferred to the igm .",
    "neutrons and antineutrons decay very fast and behave practically like protons and antiprotons , while ( anti-)deuterons and heavier nuclei are produced in negligible amounts in dm annihilations .    at the epochs of interest here , which correspond to a redshift @xmath6(10@xmath7 ) , s propagate in a medium which is eight or nine orders of magnitude more dense than at the present epoch , with typical proton and helium gas densities up to @xmath8(10@xmath9 ) particles / cm@xmath7 . even neglecting the interaction with photon baths of densities of @xmath11@xmath12 , a typical p - p inelastic cross - section of 30 mb yields a collision timescale lower than the age of the universe at decoupling .",
    "hence , we expect that in general the probability for a nucleon to interact within a hubble time is large , and that a significant energy deposition takes place ( similar estimates can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "more specifically , s will undergo the following processes :    * coulomb scattering of  on igm electrons  @xcite . ]",
    "* thomson scattering of  on igm photons  @xcite * inelastic scattering of  on igm protons  @xcite * inelastic scattering of  on igm helium  @xcite .     and @xmath13 kinetic energies .",
    "where applicable , we also show the annihilation part of the total cross - section separately . _",
    "lower panel : _ fractional energy losses relative to hubble rate , at redshift @xmath14 .",
    "the non - annihilating and annihilating parts of the hadronic cross - sections are shown separately.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and @xmath13 kinetic energies .",
    "where applicable , we also show the annihilation part of the total cross - section separately . _",

    "the non - annihilating and annihilating parts of the hadronic cross - sections are shown separately.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : losses ] we show the inelastic scattering cross - sections as a function of the  kinetic energy ( top panel ) , and the corresponding fractional energy loss rate @xmath15 times the hubble time @xmath16 at redshift @xmath14 as function of the  kinetic energy ( bottom panel ) .",
    "values of order unity or even larger indicate potentially large effects . in case of anti - protons , we plot annihilating and non - annihilating rates separately . for _ non - annihilating _",
    "inelastic interactions , the final energy distribution of  is taken to be constant in the physically accessible regime @xmath17  @xmath18 ( @xmath18 is the energy of the primary particle , @xmath17 the  mass ) .",
    "consequently , the mean energy loss during a non - annihilating collision is @xmath19 , with @xmath20 being the initial kinetic energy .",
    "the energy released during an _ annihilation _",
    "event is @xmath21 . at energies",
    "@xmath22 , the losses are dominated by inelastic -p and p - p scattering without annihilation ; at lower energies -p annihilation and coulomb losses become relevant and dominate for non - relativistic particles .    in the next section",
    "we shall follow the evolution of a nucleon pair from a hypothetical toy annihilation process @xmath23 , computing the energy loss of the daughter nucleons down to relatively low - redshifts of a few hundreds . obviously , only part of this energy will be _ absorbed _ by the gas . following in detail the energy degradation down to the energy - transfer processes to the gas  heating and ionization",
    " goes beyond our purposes ( it is worth mentioning that several efforts are being put into a more realistic treatment of the related physics for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 s , see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "rather , we will content ourselves with estimating the energy that is released into energetic electrons and photons ( essentially , the fraction of the energy lost to stable particles other than neutrinos ) .",
    "we will express this as the _ electromagnetic fraction _",
    "@xmath24 of the energy initially injected as nucleons , which we will precisely define below .",
    "this approach is exact as long as the cmb bounds are `` calorimetric '' and the precise form of the spectrum of electromagnetic particles is irrelevant in determining the ultimate fate of the energy injected .",
    "previous investigations suggest that this should provide a reasonable first approximation to the true result ; for our purposes the accuracy is expected to be at the level of @xmath25 ( see fig .  2 of @xcite , @xmath26 ) .",
    "since we are already concerned with a correction to the basic results , we shall adopt this ansatz which greatly simplifies the problem .",
    "the only potentially problematic case is the one of coulomb reactions of the ( anti-)protons , which can produce low - energy electrons ( which may behave differently from high - energy ones ) .",
    "however , the legitimacy of our approximation is supported by two arguments : i ) this energy - loss rate has only a logarithmic dependence on the minimum kinetic energy ; ii ) it only matters for non - relativistic ( anti-)protons , for which most of the energy coming from electroweak - scale wimps has already been dissipated .",
    "in fact , with the exception of very light ( gev scale ) dm particles , protons are typically born relativistic or semi - relativistic .",
    "the energy loss processes sketched above are of two distinct classes : continuous energy losses ( with small energy transfer per collision ) when protons interact with electrons or photons ; or catastrophic losses , when they undergo an inelastic collision or an annihilation ( for antiprotons ) . for the moment we shall ignore elastic collisions , we will comment on their role at the end of sec .",
    "[ results ] .",
    "continuous energy losses in the range of our interest , @xmath0 , can be described via the following differential equation @xmath27 the last term at the rhs describes adiabatic energy - losses in the expanding universe , the other two terms describe coulomb and thomson energy - losses . in the present work ,",
    "thomson losses will be neglected , which from fig .",
    "[ fig : losses ] is clearly justified at the energies of interest .",
    "hadronic processes are included on top of the continuous energy losses with a monte carlo simulation .",
    "the monte carlo starts with a fixed  energy @xmath28 at some initial redshift @xmath29 and tracks the history of the particle as it moves to lower redshifts .",
    "the redshift of an individual scattering process is inferred by sampling from a survival function , which is determined by solving a differential equation whose derivate is given by the inelastic scattering rates .",
    "the amount of electromagnetic and hadronic energy lost by each particle as function of redshift @xmath30 is recorded .    at any given redshift @xmath30",
    ", a fraction @xmath31 of the hadronically injected energy is actually channeled into electromagnetic form ( energetic @xmath32 and photons , see discussion above ) .",
    "more specifically , for annihilating dm , @xmath24 is defined as @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes here the energy released into electromagnetic form _ per comoving volume _ and per unit time , and @xmath35 is today s number density of dm particles .",
    "this @xmath31 can be derived from the integral @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the fraction of the energy of a single dm annihilation event at redshift @xmath38 that is released into electromagnetic energy at redshift @xmath30 per unit time .",
    "we will take @xmath39 throughout , such that @xmath34 at @xmath40 is independent of @xmath41 .",
    "we split @xmath31 , and analogously the function @xmath42 , into three parts according to @xmath43 with the three addenda at the rhs corresponding to coulomb losses , inelastic scattering and annihilation , respectively .",
    "these @xmath44 s denote the total ( anti-)proton energy _ lost _ to secondary particles via the scatterings .",
    "all of the energy lost by coulomb scattering , and a fraction @xmath45 of the energy lost during inelastic scattering and annihilation is channeled into electromagnetic energy and hence contributes to @xmath24 .",
    "a reasonable value is @xmath46 . after a hadronic scattering , the energy eventually carried by @xmath47 and @xmath2 contributes fully to @xmath24 ,",
    "the energy carried by @xmath48 s is completely lost , and only a fraction of the energy carried by nucleons will be transfered into @xmath49 at a later stage .",
    "we will neglect this latter contribution to @xmath24 , since it is further suppressed by the small fraction of energy released into nucleons during inelastic scattering .    as a proxy for the energy released in the different channels we can take the gluon - gluon ( or charmed quark ) channels of fig .  4 in  @xcite , where about 46% of the energy is found to be channelled into @xmath47 and @xmath2 , with @xmath50 of this amount going into nucleons .",
    "we also checked that these figures do not change appreciably as a function of @xmath51 ( m. cirelli , private communication ) .",
    "this is also consistent with the expectations from non - relativistic proton - antiproton annihilation , see e.g.  table 2 in  @xcite .",
    "a very simple justification of this value can be obtained in the limit where annihilation final states are just made of pions , with isospin - blind production yields ( equal quantities of @xmath52 ) .",
    "one would expect full channeling of @xmath53 energy into @xmath49 and about @xmath54 of the energy stored in @xmath55 , hence a weighted average of 44% .",
    "we thus believe that @xmath56 is a reasonable benchmark , probably affected by a @xmath57 uncertainty .",
    "while this may be a crude description of the actual process , it is enough for providing a first estimate of the hadronic correction to cmb bounds on annihilating dark matter .    on a more technical note , to obtain @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , we simulate particle injection at redshifts @xmath61@xmath62 and record what fraction of the energy is released in certain redshift intervals @xmath63 , divided by the corresponding time interval @xmath64 . from these @xmath65 s , we can then derive the @xmath31 from eqs .   and  .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : results ] we show the main results of this paper . in the top panel ,",
    "the resulting different components of the _ fractional energy loss _ of ( anti-)protons are shown as function of their injection energy at redshift @xmath26 .",
    "notably , the annihilation of anti - protons releases also the energy of the target proton , which yields values @xmath66 when considering the anti - proton channel alone .",

    "elastic p - p scattering is subdominant ( @xmath86 of the total p - p cross - section ) ; even rare collisions with maximal energy transfer do not alter the deposition history drastically since the energy dependence shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] is weak . in case of @xmath87-p scattering ,",
    "the elastic cross section is smaller than @xmath88 at all energies ; the main effect of collisions with large energy transfer would be a slight increase in anti - proton annihilation rate .",
    "it has been recently recognized that non - standard sources of heating and ionization of the igm can be probed via cmb anisotropies .",
    "this effect has been used to derive bounds on dm annihilation cross - section and decay lifetime .",
    "to a very good approximation , these bounds do not depend on `` astrophysics '' ( structure formation , dm halo structure , star formation etc . ) .",
    "the nature of this probe , whose robustness relies essentially on the accuracy of the description of atomic and nuclear / particle physics , motivates efforts to assess and improve the error budget of bounds obtainable with this technique .    in astroparticle physics , energy losses of high energy nucleons propagating in the intergalactic medium",
    "are usually neglected outside the realm of ultra - high energy cosmic rays .",
    "energetic nucleons propagating in a high-@xmath30 cosmological medium over hubble times , on the other hand , do suffer significant energy losses .",
    "a physically interesting example is provided by nucleon by - products of dark matter annihilation , which can release a significant fraction of their energy at high-@xmath30 ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "the aim of this paper was to provide a first estimate of this process , which goes in the direction of improving the cmb bounds for a number of channels . under reasonable approximations",
