    "although the arrival directions of the detected uhe neutrinos are consistent with isotropic distribution and exhibit no statistically significant correlation with any particular astronomical objects discussed as possible uhecr - driven neutrino emitters  @xcite , the bulk intensity of the observed neutrinos , @xmath6  gev @xmath7 s@xmath8 sr@xmath8 , offers an important clue to understand the general characteristics of uhecr sources through the link between the observed cosmic - ray and neutrino intensities .",

    "fsrqs have accretion disks with activity higher than bl lac objects , and therefore the particle acceleration region of fsrqs is filled by photons from the accretion disks , broad line regions , and dusty tori .",
    "these are the main target photons for photomeson production to produce neutrinos and also for inverse compton scattering of electrons to produce gamma rays with leptonic origin . on the other hand , since bl lac objects have only weak external photon fields , target photons are only synchrotron radiation of electrons accelerated in the same region as uhecrs .",
    "the origin of gamma rays has been studied to identify the acceleration of uhecrs , but the hadronic origin of gamma rays has never been identified clearly ; the spectrum of blazars can be reproduced by both leptonic @xcite and hadronic models at present .",
    "high - energy neutrinos are an alternative , powerful way to confirm the acceleration of uhecrs in blazars .",
    "bl lac objects have very small @xmath5 optical depth @xmath65 because of their weak synchrotron power . in the cases that gamma rays are of leptonic origin , a recent observational result with good spectral coverage for a quiescent state of mrk 421 @xcite allows us to estimate the optical depth @xmath65 of @xmath135 if protons are accelerated in the same region as electrons .",

    "hence , the optical depth is much smaller than the requirement displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : constraints_10pev ] , indicating that bl lac objects do not dominantly contribute to the pev - energy neutrino flux .",
    "fsrqs can realize a much larger @xmath5 optical depth because of strong external photon fields and their own high luminosity .",

    "the resultant @xmath5 optical depth for pev - energy neutrino production is @xmath143 @xcite .",

    "the benchmark model of a recent study for long duration grbs @xcite indicates @xmath156 .",
    "the internal shocks of low - luminosity grbs , which are 1 or 2 orders of magnitude dimmer but about 2 orders of magnitude more frequent than high - luminosity or regular grbs , are also promising sites for the production of pev - energy neutrinos @xcite .",
    "although their darkness provides fewer target photons , the @xmath5 optical depth of @xmath157  @xmath158 can still be achieved , depending on the dissipation radius .",
    "the second candidate site is external shocks , leading to grb afterglow @xcite .",
    "target photons are the synchrotron radiation of electrons accelerated at the shocks interacting with circumstellar medium .",
    "the relatively large spatial scale of the external shocks results in small photon density , and then the optical depth is @xmath159 for protons to produce pev - energy neutrinos even considering an early phase @xcite .",
    "furthermore , magnetic fields lower than those in internal shocks lead to less synchrotron cooling of charged decay products , i.e. , charged pions and muons , and therefore the energy spectrum of neutrinos peaks at high energies @xmath160  @xmath1 gev .",
    "the third possible site is inside progenitor stars .",
    "some long duration grbs with jets of a relatively small lorentz factor may fail because relativistic jets can not penetrate progenitor stars for the success of grbs .",
    "protons can be accelerated in choked jets inside the stars and then produce high - energy neutrinos via photomeson production interactions with dense stellar matter @xcite . in such dense environments ,",
    "the efficiency of @xmath161 interactions is extremely high , @xmath162 , which means that all the proton s energy is converted into neutrinos ; i.e. , the observed uhecrs and neutrinos are not directly connected .",
    "neutron star binary mergers are believed to be the origin of short grbs .",
    "the mergers also eject significant masses with subrelativistic velocity @xcite .",
    "the ejecta interact with interstellar medium and produce remnants like supernova remnants @xcite .",
    "the remnants can accelerate protons up to @xmath163 pev @xcite , and therefore are a potential source of pev neutrinos .",
    "however , target photons for @xmath161 interactions , synchrotron radiation of electrons accelerated at the same place , are sparse , and the optical depth for pev neutrino production is @xmath164  @xmath165 .    among these four possibilities , the internal shock model of regular grbs and the choked jet model are consistent with the constraint on @xmath65 from the uhecr flux at 10 pev .",

    "the luminosity is about 2 orders of magnitude smaller than that of uhecrs at 10 pev and thus too low to satisfy the requirements on the uhecr flux for @xmath125 ( @xmath170% of the total cosmic - ray flux ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : constraints_10pev ] ) unless @xmath171 .",
    "the situation is similar for low - luminosity grbs because their total energy budget is comparable with that of regular grbs .",
    "choked jets do not provide uhecrs observed at the earth because of extremely high @xmath5 optical depth , and therefore are acceptable if enough such failed grbs exist .",
    "if the spectrum of uhecrs producing the pev neutrinos extends to eev and beyond , the optical depth must be @xmath172 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : constraints_1eev ] ) , leading to the low - luminosity grbs out of the candidate sources .",
    "it is still valid that grbs can be the sources of the highest energy cosmic rays with energies of 10  100 eev .",
    "the cosmological evolution of grbs , although it is still uncertain , is not as strong as fsrqs . in ref .",

    "all three of these evolution models are consistent with the constraints by the cosmogenic neutrinos and uhecr intensity shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gzk_constraint ] . note that the break redshift of the star formation rate evolution can be regarded as our @xmath27 as a good approximation in terms of contribution to neutrinos and uhecrs because the star formation rate is no more evolved or negatively evolved above the break redshift .",

    "a power - law spectrum of cosmic rays with the index of @xmath122 at generation and a power - law distribution of the maximum energy of cosmic rays result in a power - law spectrum of total cosmic rays with the index of @xmath217 @xcite .",

    "<S> we study general implications of the icecube observations in the energy range from @xmath0  gev to @xmath1  gev for the origin of extragalactic ultrahigh energy cosmic rays assuming that high energy neutrinos are generated by the photomeson production of protons in the extragalactic universe . </S>",
    "<S> the pev - energy neutrino flux observed by icecube gives strong bounds on the photomeson - production optical depth of protons in their sources and the intensity of the proton component of extragalactic cosmic rays . </S>",
    "<S> the neutrino flux implies that extragalactic cosmic - ray sources should have the optical depth greater than @xmath2 and contribute to more than a few percent of the observed bulk of cosmic rays at 10 pev . </S>",
    "<S> if the spectrum of cosmic rays from these extragalactic sources extends well beyond 1 eev , the neutrino flux indicates that extragalactic cosmic rays are dominant in the observed total cosmic - ray flux at 1 eev and above , favoring the dip transition model of cosmic rays . </S>",
    "<S> the cosmic - ray sources are also required to be efficient neutrino emitters with the optical depth close to unity in this case . the highest energy cosmic - ray ( @xmath3 gev ) sources </S>",
    "<S> should not be strongly evolved with redshift to account for the icecube observations , suggesting that any cosmic - ray radiation scenarios involving distant powerful astronomical objects with strong cosmological evolution are strongly disfavored . </S>",
    "<S> these considerations conclude that none of the known extragalactic astronomical objects can be simultaneously a source of both pev and trans - eev energy cosmic rays . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss a possible effect of cosmic - ray propagation in magnetized intergalactic space to the connection between the observed total cosmic - ray flux and neutrino flux . </S>"
