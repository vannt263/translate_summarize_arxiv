    "dynamic aspects of the transition such as equilibration and coarsening @xcite and the stationary dynamics of the condensate @xcite are well understood heuristically , for the latter first rigorous results have been achieved recently @xcite .",

    "the process continues to be of interest , recent work on variations of the model includes mechanisms leading to more than one condensate @xcite , or the effects of memory in the dynamics @xcite . while most of the results so far consider the thermodynamic limit , finite size effects in the model with jump rates @xmath0 and @xmath5 have been investigated in @xcite using saddle point methods , and in @xcite for a variant of the model with a single defect site . in the condensed phase region , finite systems are found to exhibit a large overshoot of the stationary current above its value in the thermodynamic limit . in this paper",

    "for @xmath10 , the main focus of this article , finite systems exhibit a metastable switching behaviour between the two phases , which is prevalent in monte carlo simulations for a wide range of parameters . to capture this phenomenon we examine the system in a scaling limit and derive a rate function , which exhibits a double well structure , describing the distribution over the bulk density ( the bulk density serves as an order parameter to distinguish the fluid and condensed phases ) .",

    "based on the exact scaling limit , we can also predict the lifetime of the metastable phases for large finite systems by a heuristic random walk argument .    in general , finite system size can lead to effective long - range interactions and non - convexity of thermodynamic potentials , as has been observed for various models ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "it has recently been shown that the second mechanism via a sub - condensate can lead to a non - uniform relocation of the condensate @xcite .",
    "we have shown that a prototypical class of zero - range processes , that are known to undergo a condensation transition , exhibit large finite size effects including a metastable switching phenomenon for a large range of system parameters .",
    "we have characterized this behaviour using the background density as an order parameter , by rigorously deriving a large deviation rate function for its distribution in an appropriate scaling limit , which shows a double well structure .",
    "these results agree with recent work on the zero - range process at the critical scale @xcite , which we extend by establishing metastable fluid and condensed phases .",
    "our methods give rise to a simple interpretation of these results in terms of a stationary current balance between the fluid background and the condensate .",
    "all results presented here , except those in section [ sec : dynamics ] , concern properties of the canonical stationary distribution and are therefore independent of the geometry or dimension of the lattice , so long as it permits homogeneous stationary distributions .",
    "our results allow us to estimate the lifetime of the two metastable phases using a heuristic random walk argument .",
    "the estimates agree with previous studies of the dynamics of the condensate in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "we show that in the critical scaling limit the lifetime of the two phases is growing with system size ( as a stretched exponential ) and derive the appropriate arrhenius law including prefactor .",
    "we have also demonstrated that on finite systems the re - location dynamics of the condensate is dominated by switching to the metastable fluid phase for a large parameter range , rather than the mechanism via a second sub - condensate assumed in previous results , which is relevant in the thermodynamic limit .     the current overshoot in the scaling limit for @xmath5 and @xmath86 .",
    "the thick black line shows the scaling limit result and the rescaled canonical currents are shown for various system sizes by thin coloured lines , they slowly approaching the scaling limit as @xmath52 increases .",
    "the transition point is given by @xmath337 which is given in @xcite .",
    ", scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the zero - range process provides an interesting example where the thermodynamic limit fails to capture essential parts of the dynamics , and contradicts the usual expectation that finite systems should behave in a smoother fashion than the limiting prediction .",
    "although the aim of this paper is not to discuss particular applications in detail , the finite size effects described here are particularly important for a proper understanding of various real condensation phenomena . to name two relevant examples , the condensing zero - range process has recently been applied as a simplified traffic model as well as to describe clustering phenomena in granular media @xcite .",
    "both of these applications exhibit metastability phenomena , and typical system sizes are of order @xmath338 , the region where metastability effects in our analysis are most relevant .",
    "since our results hold for a large generic class of zero - range models , they suggest that the apparent metastability in many applications is not necessarily the result of a particular choice of the jump rates , but rather a generic finite size phenomenon .",
    "while the results in the scaling limit hold for all zero - range processes with the same tail behaviour as the rates ( [ eq : rates ] ) , the strength of the effect for relevant system sizes will of course depend on the details of the particular application .",
    "traffic modelling is an example where metastability is particularly pronounced @xcite , and it is an interesting question to investigate in detail the applicability of the zero - range process and our results in that area .",
    "using the methods discussed in this paper , a direct application of the findings in @xcite allows us to extend our results on the current overshoot to zero - range processes with rates ( [ eq : rates ] ) where @xmath28 and @xmath339 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : gammaone ] .",
    "the critical scale in this case turns out to be of order @xmath340 , and the system also shows a discontinuous current overshoot in the scaling limit .",
    "however , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : gammaone ] , convergence is very slow and there are no metastable phases on the critical scale .",
    "although metastability might occur on higher order scales , it will hardly be relevant in any finite size simulation or application .",
    "the scaling limit rate function in theorem [ thm : main ] could also be derived using a slightly modified version of the saddle point methods applied in @xcite",
    ". however , the direct approximation of the fluid and condensed metastable phases used in this paper seems more intuitive for our purpose , and can be made rigorous with less effort than a saddle point computation .",
