    "the wiretap channel considered in the seminal paper  @xcite is the first example that demonstrates the possibility of secure communications at the physical layer .",
    "it is shown in  @xcite that a source can transmit a message at a positive ( secrecy ) rate to a destination in such a way that an eavesdropper only gathers information at a negligible rate , when the source - to - eavesdropper channel is a degraded version of the source - to - destination channel . a similar result for the gaussian wiretap channel is provided in  @xcite .",
    "the work in  @xcite further removes the degraded wiretap channel restriction showing that positive secrecy capacity is possible if the destination channel is `` more capable '' ( `` less noisy '' for a full extension of the rate region in  @xcite ) than the eavesdropper s channel .",
    "recently , there has been a flurry of interest in extending these early results to more sophisticated channel models , including fading wiretap channels , multi - input multi - output ( mimo ) wiretap channels , multiple - access wiretap channels , broadcast wiretap channels , relay wiretap channels , _",
    "etc_. we do not attempt to provide a comprehensive summary of all recent developments , and highlight only results that are most relevant to the present work .",
    "we refer interested readers to the introduction and reference list of  @xcite for a concise and extensive overview of recent works .",
    "when the destination and eavesdropper channels experience independent fading , the strict requirement of having a more capable destination channel for positive secrecy capacity can be loosened .",
    "this is due to the simple observation that the destination channel may be more capable than the eavesdropper s channel under some fading realizations , even if the destination is not more capable than the eavesdropper on average .",
    "hence , if the channel state information ( csi ) of both the destination and eavesdropper channels is available at the source , it is shown in  @xcite that a positive secrecy capacity can be achieved by means of appropriate power control at the source .",
    "the key idea is to opportunistically transmit only during those fading realizations for which the destination channel is more capable  @xcite . for block - ergodic",
    "fading , it is also shown in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) that a positive secrecy capacity can be achieved with a variable - rate transmission scheme without any eavesdropper csi available at the source .",
    "when the source , destination , and eavesdropper have multiple antennas , the resulting channel is known as a mimo wiretap channel ( see  @xcite ) , which may also have positive secrecy capacity . since the mimo wiretap channel is not degraded , the characterization of its secrecy capacity is not straightforward .",
    "for instance , the secrecy capacity of the mimo wiretap channel is characterized in  @xcite as the saddle point of a minimax problem , while an alternative characterization based on a recent result for multi - antenna broadcast channels is provided in  @xcite .",
    "interestingly all characterizations point to the fact that the capacity achieving scheme is one that transmits only in the directions in which the destination channel is more capable than the eavesdropper s channel .",
    "obviously , this is only possible when the destination and eavesdropper csi is available at the source .",
    "it is shown in  @xcite that if the individual channels from antennas to antennas suffer from independent rayleigh fading , and the respective ratios of the numbers of source and destination antennas to that of eavesdropper antennas are larger than certain fixed values , then the secrecy capacity is positive with probability one when the numbers of source , destination , and eavesdropper antennas become very large .",
    "as discussed above , the availability of destination ( and eavesdropper ) csi at the source is an implicit requirement for positive secrecy capacity in the fading and mimo wiretap channels .",
    "thus , an authenticated feedback channel is needed to send the csi from the destination back to the source . in  @xcite , this feedback channel is assumed to be public , and hence the destination csi is also available to the eavesdropper .",
    "in addition , it is assumed that the eavesdropper knows its own csi . with the availability of a feedback channel ,",
    "if the objective of having the source send secret information to the destination is relaxed to distilling a secret key shared between the source and destination , it is shown in  @xcite that a positive key rate is achievable when the destination and eavesdropper channels are two conditionally independent ( given the source input symbols ) memoryless binary channels , even if the destination channel is not more capable than the eavesdropper s channel .",
    "this notion of secret sharing is formalized in  @xcite based on the concept of _ common randomness _ between the source and destination . assuming the availability of an interactive , authenticated public channel with unlimited capacity between the source and destination , @xcite suggests two different system models , called the `` source model with wiretapper '' ( sw ) and the `` channel model with wiretapper '' ( cw ) .",
    "the cw model is the similar to the ( discrete memoryless ) wiretap channel model that we have discussed before .",
    "the sw model differs in that the random symbols observed at the source , destination , and eavesdropper are realizations of a discrete memoryless source with multiple components .",
    "both sw and cw models have been extended to the case of secret sharing among multiple terminals , with the possibility of some terminals acting as helpers  @xcite .",
    "key capacities have been obtained for the two special cases in which the eavesdropper s channel is a degraded version of the destination channel and in which the destination and eavesdropper channels are conditionally independent  @xcite .",
    "similar results have been derived for multi - terminal secret sharing  @xcite , with the two special cases above subsumed by the more general condition that the terminal symbols form a markov chain on a tree .",
    "authentication of the public channel can be achieved by the use of an initial short key and then a small portion of the subsequent shared secret message  @xcite .",
    "a detailed study of secret sharing over an unauthenticated public channel is given in  @xcite .",
    "other approaches to employ feedback have also been recently considered  @xcite . in particular , it is shown in  @xcite that positive secrecy capacity can be achieved for the modulo - additive discrete memoryless wiretap channel and the modulo-@xmath0 channel if the destination is allowed to send signals back to the source over the same wiretap channel and both terminals can operate in full - duplex manner .",
    "in fact , for the former channel , the secrecy capacity is the same as the capacity of such a channel in the absence of the eavesdropper .    in this paper , we consider secret sharing over a fast - fading mimo wiretap channel .",
    "thus , we are interested in the cw model of  @xcite with memoryless conditionally independent destination and eavesdropper channels and continuous channel alphabets .",
    "we provide an extension of the key capacity result in  @xcite for this case to include continuous channel alphabets ( theorem  [ thm : keycapgen ] ) . using this result",
    ", we obtain the key capacity of the fast - fading mimo wiretap channel ( section  [ se : fading ] ) .",
    "our result indicates that the key capacity is always positive , no matter how large the channel gain of the eavesdropper s channel is ; in addition this holds even if the destination and eavesdropper csi is available at the destination and eavesdropper , respectively .",
    "of course , the availability of the public channel implies that the destination csi could be fed back to the source .",
    "however , due to the restrictions imposed on the secret - sharing strategies ( see section  [ se : secret ] ) , only causal feedback is allowed , and thus any destination csi available at source is `` outdated '' . this does not turn out to be a problem since , unlike the approaches mentioned above",
    ", the source does not use the csi to avoid sending secret information when the destination is not more capable than the eavesdropper s channel . as a matter of fact",
    ", the fading process of the destination channel provides a significant part of the common randomness from which the source and the destination distill a secret key .",
    "this fact is readily obtained from the alternative achievability proof given in section  [ se : proof ] .",
    "we note that  @xcite consider the problem key generation from common randomness over wiretap channels and exploit a wyner - ziv coding scheme to limit the amount of information conveyed from the source to the destination via the wiretap channel . unlike these previous works",
    ", we only employ wyner - ziv coding to quantize the destination channel outputs .",
    "our code construction still relies on a public channel with unlimited capacity to achieve the key capacity .    finally , we also investigate the limiting value of the key capacity under three asymptotic scenarios . in the first scenario ,",
    "the transmission power of the source becomes asymptotically high ( corollary  [ thm : keycaplimp ] ) . in the second scenario ,",
    "the destination and eavesdropper have a large number of antennas ( corollary  [ thm : keycapant ] ) . in the third scenario ,",
    "the gain advantage of the eavesdropper s channel becomes asymptotically large ( corollary  [ thm : keycaplim ] ) .",
    "these three scenarios reveal two different effects of spatial dimensionality upon key capacity . in the first scenario , we show that the key capacity levels off as the power increases if the eavesdropper has no fewer antennas than the source . on the other hand , when the source has more antennas , the key capacity can increase without bound with the source power . in the second scenario , we show that the spatial dimensionality advantage that the eavesdropper has over the destination has exactly the same effect as the channel gain advantage of the eavesdropper . in the third scenario , we show that the limiting key capacity is positive only if the eavesdropper has fewer antennas than the source . the results in these scenarios confirm that spatial dimensionality can be used to combat the eavesdropper s gain advantage , which was already observed for the mimo wiretap channel . perhaps more surprisingly , this is achieved with neither the source nor destination needing any eavesdropper csi .",
    "we consider the cw model of  @xcite , and we recall its characteristics for completeness .",
    "we consider three terminals , namely a source , a destination , and an eavesdropper .",
    "the source sends symbols from an alphabet @xmath1 .",
    "the destination and eavesdropper observe symbols belonging to alphabets @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively . unlike in  @xcite , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 need not be discrete .",
    "in fact , in section  [ se : fading ] we will assume they are multi - dimensional vector spaces over the complex field",
    ". the channel from the source to the destination and eavesdropper is assumed memoryless . a generic symbol sent by the source",
    "is denoted by @xmath4 and the corresponding symbols observed by the destination and eavesdropper are denoted by @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively . for notational convenience ( and without loss of generality ) , we assume that @xmath7 are jointly continuous , and the channel is specified by the conditional probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath8 . in addition , we restrict ourselves to cases in which @xmath5 and @xmath6 are conditionally independent given @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath9 , which is a reasonable model for symbols broadcasted in a wireless medium .",
    "hereafter , we drop the subscripts in pdfs whenever the concerned symbols are well specified by the arguments of the pdfs .",
    "we assume that an interactive , authenticated public channel with unlimited capacity is also available for communicatin between the source and destination . here , _",
    "interactive _ means that the channel is two - way and can be used multiple times , _ unlimited capacity _ means that it is noiseless and has infinite capacity , and _",
    "public _ and _ authenticated _ mean that the eavesdropper can perfectly observe all communications over this channel but can not tamper with the messages transmitted .",

    "this creates a conceptual memoryless wiretap channel from the destination with input symbol @xmath56 to the source in the presence of the eavesdropper , where the source observes @xmath57 while the eavesdropper observes @xmath58 .",
