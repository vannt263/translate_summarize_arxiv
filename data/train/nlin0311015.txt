    "spurred by experimental and technological developments in supramolecular chemistry and biophysics , there is a raising interest to study nonequilibrium structures related to self - organization phenomena in weakly condensed systems . in such systems , attractive potential interactions between constituent molecules are essential .",
    "equilibrium structures in soft matter correspond to minima of free energy , and are caused by the competition between short - range attractive and long - range repulsive interactions @xcite .",
    "in contrast to this , nonequilibrium patterns require permanent supply of energy and correspond to persistent ( stationary or time - dependent ) kinetic states of a system@xcite .",
    "typically , they result from an interplay between reactions , diffusion and phase transitions .",
    "examples of nonequilibrium pattern formation in reactive soft matter include stationary turing - like patterns in phase - separating binary polymer mixtures with chemical reactions @xcite and in monomolecular adsorbates on metal surfaces @xcite .",
    "theoretical analysis for two - component reactive adsorbates @xcite and for three - component reactive polymer systems @xcite has further shown that not only stationary patterns , but also traveling and standing waves are possible .",
    "langmuir films are monomolecular layers of amphiphilic molecules on an air - water interface .",
    "such films are a classical example of soft matter and , generally , it should be expected that , in the presence of chemical reactions and energy flows , they would form nonequilibrium patterns .",
    "though equilibrium properties of langmuir monolayers are thoroughly investigated ( see @xcite ) , nonequilibrium phenomena in these systems still remain less explored . in an interesting series of experiments , tabe and yokoyama have studied illuminated langmuir monolayers of amphiphilic derivatives of azobenzene by means of the brewster - angle microscopy @xcite . in these experiments , transitions between _ trans _ and",
    "_ cis _ conformations of individual molecules were photo - induced by polarized light of a selected wavelength . since physical properties of the two conformations",
    "are different , the _",
    "trans _ and _ cis _ isomers essentially represented two different species .",
    "in addition to photo - induced periodic stationary patterns , these experiments have shown , for the first time , spontaneously emerging patterns of propagating waves of molecular reorientation under appropriate illumination conditions .    in the letter @xcite , we proposed a model of reactive two - component langmuir monolayers with orientational ordering .",
    "this model was taking into account phase separation in the two - component system , reaction interconverting both species , diffusion of reactants and processes of orientational ordering .",
    "interactions between the components of the monolayer resulted not only from the positional , but also from the orientational order of the hydrophobic tails of constituent molecules , determined by their tilt .",
    "we have shown that this model already reproduces nonequilibrium traveling - wave patterns which arise as a consequence of a hopf bifurcation with a finite wavenumber . to simplify the analysis , it was assumed that the azimuthal orientation of molecules remained fixed and uniform , so that only their tilts could vary .",
    "moreover , some orientational - order contributions to the free energy of the monolayer were neglected .",
    "the inclusion of azimuthal variations is , however , important for a comparison with the experimental data yielded by the brewster - angle microscopy that is sensitive to the local azimuthal orientational ordering .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to formulate and to study a more general model that contains both orientational variables , and includes bend and splay distortion terms .",

    "modeling the situation in the photo - isomerization experiments , molecules @xmath0 are supposed to have an elongated shape with a long tail ( the _ trans _ isomer ) and molecules @xmath1 to have a crumpled conformation ( the _ cis _ isomer ) . according to this assumption , only molecules @xmath0",
    "are subject to orientational order , whereas molecules @xmath1 play essentially the role of passive dilution with respect to such ordering .",
    "furthermore , a photo - induced reaction interconverting @xmath0 and @xmath1 molecules is considered .",
    "the total concentration of components @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the monolayer is assumed constant .",
    "therefore , the local composition of the monolayer is characterized by the concentration order parameter @xmath2 representing the local fraction of molecules @xmath0 ( so that @xmath3 gives the local fraction of molecules @xmath1 ) .",
    "the local orientational order is described by the order parameter @xmath4 , that corresponds to the projection of the local mesoscopic average of the unit molecular director @xmath5 of the elongated molecules @xmath0 onto the monolayer plane ( see fig .",

    "the choice of the function @xmath27 should be based on the kinetic analysis with respect to the orientation of molecules involved in the reactive process . in our model , the reaction @xmath28 , transforming crumpled molecules into the elongated form , is assumed to be strongly energetically activated by light .",
    "this means that new molecules @xmath0 would be created with high initial energy and can adopt any orientation @xmath4 , independent of the orientation of surrounding molecules .",
    "therefore , the orientation of newly created molecules @xmath0 is random and the statistical average of @xmath4 is zero . because any conversion from an elongated molecule @xmath0 to the crumpled molecule @xmath1 decreases the local order and the reverse conversion process does not increase it , the overall reaction effect is that it tends to destroy orientational ordering . under such assumptions , local evolution for the orientation momentum @xmath29",

    "[ figperf]a , we find that the droplet is slightly elongated in the direction parallel to the azimuth molecular orientation and , moreover , the tilt peak in the rear part of the moving droplet is higher than that at the front .",
    "this asymmetry determines the propagation direction of the droplet .",
    "furthermore , we have checked that the asymmetry gets stronger when the splay coupling coefficient @xmath136 is increased .",
    "the profiles of a traveling stripe from fig .",

    "we see that the profiles exhibit more smooth variation in this case , and the variation of @xmath2 and @xmath77 is closer to harmonical .",

    "= 3.4 in    = 3.4 in    = 2.4 in = 2.4 in    in the simulations described above random initial conditions were chosen .",
    "we have also studied some special initial conditions for the orientation distribution that give rise to domain sinks or sources . in the simulation shown in fig .",
    "[ figvert ] and video fig[figvert].mpg , the initial condition with two orientational domains ( @xmath137 for @xmath138 and @xmath139 for @xmath140 ) has been chosen .",
    "the boundary between the domains plays here a role of source emitting waves . for other initial conditions , corresponding to outward vortices of molecular orientation ,",
    "we have observed droplets that are generated in the center of a vortex and travel in the radial direction out of it .",
    "generally , linear and point defects with positive ( negative ) splay @xmath141 act as sources ( sinks ) for the traveling structures that involve tilt and composition variations .",
    "= 3.4 in      when the coefficient @xmath81 , specifying the intensity of splay coupling , is further increased , the azimuthal orientation of molecules becomes influenced by the traveling or stationary patterns .",
    "for strong splay coupling , stationary nonequilibrium patterns are usually observed .",
    "an example of such a pattern is shown in fig .",
    "[ figlgtk ] .",
    "starting from random initial conditions , the system first develops a pattern of traveling stripes .",
    "subsequently , the stripes undergo breakdown and a frozen array of orientation defects is produced . inside each defect , the concentration of the elongated molecules is increased , and in general , these molecules are oriented towards the center of a defect .",
    "this stationary pattern is favoured in the case of strong coupling , since it minimizes the splay contribution towards the free energy of the system .",
    "= 3.4 in    to avoid the formation of immobile splay defects , a region in the parameter space , characterized by the wave instability but lying closer to the boundary of a transition to the nontilted state , can be considered . because the elongated molecules are only slightly tilted in this region , their reorientation is energetically easier than far from the boundary @xmath106 . if a relatively large value of the reaction rate constant @xmath102 is additionally chosen , so that the system is driven further away from thermal equilibrium , traveling waves that are accompanied by azimuthal reorientation of molecules are formed .",
    "an example of the developing wave pattern is shown in fig .",
    "[ figcorner ] and video fig[figcorner].mpg .",
    "the temporal evolution of this pattern along the central vertical cross section is additionally displayed in fig . [ figcornerevol ] . after a short transient starting from random initial conditions ,",
    "the system soon developes a regular pattern of stripes traveling at a constant velocity .",
    "the profiles of the composition @xmath2 , the tilt @xmath77 and the azimuth angle @xmath8 along the line orthogonal to the propagation direction are shown in fig .",
    "[ figperfcorner ] .",
    "an important difference with the profiles of equilibrium stationary stripes is that , for traveling stripes , the azimuth angle does not undergo @xmath130 rotations from one stripe to another ( seen in fig .",
    "[ figperfstripes ] ) . instead",
    ", a periodic angular modulation within the interval from zero to @xmath142 is observed here .",
    "moreover , it can be noticed that the composition @xmath2 and the tilt @xmath77 vary completely in phase for such traveling stripes , i.e. the maximum of the concentration field coincides with a minimum of the tilt distribution .",
    "this differs from the behaviour of such variables in traveling stripes at weak splay coupling ( cf .",
    "[ figperf]b ) .",
    "the propagation direction is now fixed by a small shift observed in the azimuth angle variation with respect to the profiles of variables @xmath2 and @xmath77 .",
    "= 3.4 in    = 2.5 in    = 3.in",
    "we have formulated a theoretical model to describe pattern formation in illuminated two - component langmuir monolayers . in this model , nonequilibrium pattern formation results from an interplay between phase separation , optically induced transitions between the two immiscible conformations , and coupling of phase separation to orientational ordering of molecules in the monolayer . in comparison with the previous model @xcite ,",
    "the current description is more complete because variations of the azimuthal variation of the elongated molecules in the monolayer are allowed .",
    "we have also incorporated into the model the splay coupling between azimuthal orientation and variations of local concentration . the situation corresponding to illumination with non - polarized light has been considered .",
    "in contrast to the earlier simple model @xcite , the investigated system is characterized , in absence of illumination , by the formation of equilibrium stationary patterns representing arrays of orientational defects ( vortices ) , stripes or soliton - like structures with sharp domain walls .",
    "all these patterns are caused by splay interactions and have a purely energetic origin , so that they can be also interpreted by considering minima of free energy ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "linear stability investigation of the uniform state of the model under illumination conditions has been performed .",
    "it reveals that , generally , splay interaction favour the appearance of traveling patterns .",
    "such patterns are observed even in the parameter regions occupied by stationary structures in the earlier model @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of the proposed model have been undertaken .",
    "they show a rich spectrum of spatio - temporal structures . for weak splay coupling and relatively low reaction rates ,",
    "a pattern of droplets slowly flowing along the local directions determined by azimuthal orientation of molecules has been observed .",
    "if the reaction is stronger , the droplets are replaced by a pattern of traveling stripes following the local azimuthal orientation .",
    "interactions between droplets and stripes and the orientational defects have been seen .",
    "it is found that linear and point orientational defects play a role of sources or sinks of traveling structures in this system .",
    "when splay coupling is weak , the spatial pattern of azimuthal orientation is not affected by local concentration variations .",
    "the temporal evolution of the orientation pattern in this case is governed by the elastic interactions between molecules .",
    "starting from a random initial distribution , they produce after a short transient a stationary pattern of azimuthal orientation that remains frozen afterwards .",
    "in contrast to this , strong splay coupling with the concentration field leads to the appearance of stationary and spatiotemporal patterns where variations of azimuthal orientation are correlated with the the changes in the local composition of the monolayer .",
    "often , stationary arrays of splay defects are observed in this case .",
    "however , when the system is close to the orientational phase transition ( from the tilted to the non - tilted phase ) , patterns of traveling waves accompanied by strong variation of azimuthal orientation are found in the model .",
    "this investigation , as well as the earlier letter @xcite , are motivated by the experimental discovery of traveling structures in illuminated langmuir monolayers by tabe and yokoyama @xcite . the extended model , which we have now explored , is able to reproduce some essential features of the experiments .",
    "in absence of illumination , equilibrium orientation patterns are yielded by the model .",
    "under illumination for sufficiently strong splay coupling , traveling waves accompanied by changes in azimuthal orientation of molecules are also found .",
    "the experiments @xcite were performed by using polarized light , and light polarization significantly influenced the properties of the observed patterns .",
    "in contrast to this , our model does not include the effects of light polarization and thus corresponds to illumination with non - polarized light . though the inclusion of anisotropy effects due to light polarization is straightforward , the resulting model is more complicated and not yet discussed in the present paper .",
    "langmuir monolayers represent a classical example of soft matter and are closely related to biomembranes , playing a fundamental role in cell biology .",
    "therefore , investigations of nonequilibrium pattern formation in such monolayers under reactive conditions can help in understanding of general mechanisms of nonequilibrium self - organization in soft matter .",
    "our study provides evidence that traveling orientational wave patterns may represent a generic property of langmuir monolayers that are subjected to chemical reaction and composition changes .",
    "we have found that various patterns , representing traveling droplets or stripes , wave sources and sinks , and orientational defects interacting with the traveling structures , are possible in such systems .",
