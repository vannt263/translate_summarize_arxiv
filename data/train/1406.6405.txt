    "experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) have both been able to produce and detect an exotic phase of matter , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , by colliding massive nuclei at relativistic energies .",
    "the energy densities involved in these collisions are so intense that the hadrons participating in the collisions dissolve into their constituent partons , creating a state of matter in which the color charge is no longer confined . despite the short lifetime of this matter ( on the order of @xmath5 fm / c ) , there is strong evidence that it has time to ( locally ) thermalize and can be described as a nearly perfect fluid .",
    "one can compute the expected abundance of different particle species produced from a thermalized qgp and compare it with the ratios of detected particle species at rhic or lhc ; the results are in good agreement with one another @xcite , @xcite .",
    "another place where hydrodynamics has provided particularly good agreement with heavy ion experiments is with the so - called `` collective flow '' @xcite @xcite .",
    "when two nuclei collide the resulting qgp will be anisotropic in space , because of differences in density distributions inside the individual nuclei , even for central collisions . within hydrodynamics ( implying strong interactions ) ,",
    "pressure gradients will convert this spatial anisotropy into an anisotropy in momentum space .",
    "this effect would not be observed if the matter produced were noninteracting .",
    "the full power spectrum resulting from heavy ion collisions is given by the fourier transform of the two particle correlation function @xcite @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the particle count and @xmath8 is the relative momentum angle between two observed particles .",
    "the elliptic flow is controlled by the coefficient @xmath9 . from this power spectrum",
    ", one should be able to extract information about the initial density fluctuations or other physics in the qgp , in analogy with the cosmic microwave background power spectrum .",
    "one way to theoretically investigate this power spectrum is by studying hydrodynamic fluctuations on top of a smooth fluid flow and following how these perturbations propagate through to the particle spectra and on to the @xmath10 .",
    "this approach was taken by staig and shuryak in a series of research papers @xcite @xcite @xcite studying linear perturbations .",
    "one can also study the power spectrum numerically using fully nonlinear hydrodynamic codes .    both of these approaches require much analytic or numerical effort to obtain the power spectrum . in order to obviate the need for this extensive effort every time one wants to compare theory and experiment ,",
    "focus has been placed on determining how particular features of the power spectrum are affected by properties of the qgp itself , e.g. the viscosity or freezeout temperature .",
    "particular interest has been placed on the first minimum of the power spectrum @xcite or on the hydrodynamic response of the system @xmath11 where the @xmath12 , defined by @xmath13 are the initial state eccentricities . here",
    "@xmath14 is the initial energy density , and the integrals are over the transverse plane of the collision .",
    "this response is often proposed to depend on hydrodynamic parameters by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the transverse size of the collision , @xmath17 is the temperature of the collision , @xmath18 is the shear viscosity , and @xmath19 is the entropy density .",
    "this dependence of the response has been investigated by lacey _",
    "one of the questions we investigate in this paper is how robust these conclusions are ; that is , can information about the initial state fluctuations or about properties of the qgp actually be extracted once one has averaged over many events ?      full , nonlinear hydrodynamic flow generally requires computer code in order to generate results , because the full equations are too complicated to solve analytically .",
    "however , one can often investigate the approximate behavior of the full solutions by considering small perturbations around a known analytical flow .",
    "if one possesses a given analytical flow , i.e. its energy - momentum tensor @xmath20 , then one can consider energy momentum tensors of the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is small to the first order .",
    "taking the covariant derivative of this perturbed energy - momentum tensor leads directly to the first order equations for the perturbation . in what follows we will consider perturbations to the energy density , pressure , and four velocity directly , which make up the energy momentum tensor @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the energy density",
    ", @xmath25 is the pressure , @xmath26 is the four - velocity , @xmath27 is the metric , @xmath18 is the shear viscosity , @xmath28 is the bulk viscosity and @xmath29 @xmath30 the simplest flow used to model heavy ion collisions is the so - called bjorken flow , which possesses boost invariance in the longitudinal @xmath31 direction ( the velocity profile is such that a lorentz boost in the @xmath31 direction leaves the flow unchanged ) , rotational invariance in the transverse plane ( the @xmath32 direction ) , and translational invariance in the transverse plane .",
    "what makes this flow so simple is that by the change of coordinates from @xmath33 to @xmath34 defined by @xmath35 the four - velocity profile reduces to @xmath36 with a metric @xmath37    in the past few years another analytical flow has been found that can be used to model heavy ion collisions .",
    "gubser @xcite , @xcite exchanged the translational invariance in the transverse plane associated with bjorken flow for conformal invariance .",
    "this allows the fluid to expand radially at the expense of fixing the trace of the energy - momentum tensor to be zero . having a radially - expanding analytical fluid flow opens up the possibility of investigating more realistic linear perturbations than were permitted by bjorken flow . in what follows",
    ", we shall refer to this new flow as gubser flow .",
    "there exists a coordinate system in which gubser flow is also particularly simple .",
    "first , one can rescale the metric @xmath38 introducing the parameter @xmath39 , which characterizes the transverse scale of the system ( more precisely , @xmath40 does this ) , and the new coordinates @xmath41 and @xmath42 defined by @xmath43 one can complete the transformation .",
    "the rescaled metric in the coordinates @xmath44 is given by @xmath45 and the fluid flow is simply @xmath46 .",
    "note that because the gubser flow is conformal , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath14 .    in what follows",
    "we first examine rapidity independent perturbations of the gubser flow .",
    "we begin by discussing first order perturbations to the gubser flow in general , and then state the specific setup that we have examined .",
    "we then present our two approaches to the problem .",
    "we state our results for this analysis , and compare them with previous work along these lines . after this semi - analytic approach",
    ", we examine similar perturbations numerically in full nonlinear hydrodynamics .",
    "the power spectra we obtain are analyzed , specifically for the stability of the first minimum and for the dependence of the hydrodynamic response on @xmath2 .",
    "these results are stated and the results of the two approaches are compared in a concluding section .",
    "we begin by outlining the general framework of first order perturbations to the gubser flow .",
    "as derived in @xcite , the background temperature in the rescaled frame is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 is a hypergeometric function , and here and in everything that follows , @xmath53 .",
    "this value was used by gubser @xcite @xcite as the value that best matched experimental results at rhic .",
    "the parameter @xmath54 characterizes the initial temperature of the flow .",
    "the perturbation is implemented by varying the rescaled temperature and four - velocity by a small amount : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the covariant components of the background four - velocity and @xmath57 as detailed in @xcite we can further split the spacial variables from the timelike one by projecting the scalar @xmath58 onto the basis of spherical harmonics and the two nonzero components of the @xmath59 onto the derivatives of the spherical harmonics using the decomposition @xmath60 with @xmath61 . here , the @xmath62 are simply the coefficients in these expansions ( the ambiguity in their definition can be removed by demanding that @xmath63 for some fixed @xmath64 ) . in our analysis",
    ", we include all @xmath65 .",
    "we will often drop the @xmath66 subscript and simply write @xmath58 and @xmath67 when there is an equation that holds for each @xmath66 . note that we are ignoring the so - called vector modes by making this decomposition , for the most general basis for vectors on @xmath68 depending on the coordinates",
    "@xmath69 will be of the form @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a scalar function and the divergence of @xmath72 on @xmath68 vanishes @xcite .",
    "the equations for @xmath58 and @xmath67 can be written in the form @xmath73 where @xmath74 and the components of the @xmath75 matrix are @xmath76 this matrix equation @xmath77 can be reduced to a second order equation for @xmath58 : @xmath78 all of the information about the perturbed system follows from the solutions of .",
    "we have used to investigate the evolution of an initial gaussian hotspot @xmath79 with the further assumption that there be no initial velocity perturbations .",
    "@xmath80 we have done this in two separate ways ( method a and method b ) , which we will outline in the next two subsections .",
    "the @xmath81 coordinate was varied , keeping @xmath82 fixed for the hotspot .",
    "this fixed a value for @xmath64 by the coordinate relations , .",
    "a standard cooper - frye isothermal freezeout was then used in order to compute the particle spectrum of pions : @xmath83 the distribution function @xmath84 was taken to be a simple boltzmann distribution .",
    "modifications of the freezeout surface were taken into account by keeping terms in the exponent of the boltzmann distribution to the first order in @xmath85 , the modification to the freezeout time .",
    "after obtaining the particle spectrum , we calculated two - particle correlations by multiplying two single particle distributions and averaging over the @xmath32 component of the initial perturbation @xmath86 with @xmath87 .",
    "the two - particle distributions were then fourier decomposed in order to generate a power spectrum ; that is , the coefficients @xmath88 in the expansion @xmath6      the first method that we used to solve was by using a standard numerical ordinary differential equation solver .",
    "the initial conditions were set for each of the @xmath66 equations by decomposing the initial hotspot into spherical harmonics .",
    "these components were then set to be the coefficients @xmath62 in , and the initial condition for each @xmath58 was then simply @xmath89 . the second initial condition was fixed by the demand that there be no initial fluid flow .",
    "this is the approach followed in work by staig and shuryak @xcite .",
    "there is a completely different way to approach the initial value problem described above .",
    "consider a flow in which a perturbation `` turns on '' at an initial time @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath90 here @xmath91 is the total energy - momentum tensor for the system .",
    "this leads to hydrodynamic equations of the form @xmath92 we can thus view an initial value problem for the hydrodynamic equations as a problem of a _ sourced _ fluid flow for @xmath58 . with this application in mind",
    ", we shall now outline how we construct the relevant green s functions for this problem .",
    "observe that the @xmath93s in can be viewed as functions of @xmath94 only .",
    "this means that we can rewrite the equation in terms of the new variable @xmath95 .",
    "if we further expand to first order in @xmath96 , we arrive at @xmath97 = 0 , \\label{eq : first order}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now observe that for @xmath98 , we have @xmath99 .",
    "this suggests that perhaps the ansatz @xmath100 with @xmath101 the @xmath1th legendre polynomial and @xmath102 the @xmath1th unknown coefficient , will be useful .",
    "if we substitute into and then apply the integral operator @xmath103 to both sides of the equation , we arrive at an algebraic relation between the unknown coefficients @xmath104 .",
    "unfortunately , in the case @xmath105 these relations involve an infinite number of the @xmath104 . if , however , we limit our ansatz to a finite expansion @xmath106 we arrive at a set of linear relations between the coefficients @xmath107 \\cap { \\mathbb{n}}\\}$ ] . in our analysis , we take @xmath108 , when solving the linear equations , but we only use the first @xmath109 terms when calculating results .",
    "we use a larger @xmath7 when solving the linear equations than when generating results because truncating the series introduces errors , which mainly affect the larger @xmath1 coefficients .",
    "if we regard this set as a column vector @xmath110 and the set of matrix coefficients in the resulting linear equations @xmath111 , then we have reduced our original differential equation to the linear equations @xmath112 for each @xmath66 in , there should be two linearly independent solutions .",
    "we can find them by considering the two `` initial conditions '' @xmath113 in the inviscid case , these correspond to even and odd solutions respectively .",
    "these initial conditions can be implemented as follows . if we split the column vector @xmath110 as @xmath114 and the matrix @xmath111 as @xmath115 where @xmath116 is one of the two initial conditions , @xmath117 are the @xmath118 remaining coefficients , @xmath119 is a @xmath120 matrix and @xmath121 is a square @xmath122 matrix .",
    "we then see that can be rewritten as @xmath123 , which allows one to solve for the unknown coefficients @xmath124 we now address the question of the source .",
    "suppose we have a sourced hydrodynamic system with evolution equation @xmath125 how does this source @xmath126 propagate through to the equation for @xmath58 ?",
    "recall that @xmath58 was defined by @xmath127 we can preform a similar decomposition to this source term as was done with the @xmath128 decomposition ; that is @xmath129 using this decomposition , one finds that the source term on the right side of is @xmath130 where @xmath131 using this source and the method described above , one can construct solutions of sourced hydrodynamic equations in the @xmath132 coordinate system . we have applied this method to the problem outlined above , and our results are described in the following sections .",
    "this method is also interesting in its own right and can be used to analyze two point functions directly , as has been investigated by springer and stephanov @xcite . letting @xmath133 denote the source of the @xmath58 equation , we can write a particular @xmath66 solution in the form @xmath134 with @xmath135 ( x ' ) } \\sum_{a } \\sum_{b } ( l_{a } r_{b } - l_{b } r_{a } ) p_{a}(x ' ) p_{b}(x ) .",

    "they have the expansions @xmath141 respectively .",
    "since we have constructed the actual green s functions , we can investigate the true two point functions for a dirac-@xmath58 source using this method .",
    "we have calculated the power spectrum for a first order perturbation using method b for @xmath142 , which corresponds to an initial temperature of @xmath143 mev .",
    "the sample inviscid plot is shown in figure [ fig : inviscid ] .",
    "the width of the gaussian hotspot used in our analysis was @xmath144 , to make it significantly more narrow than the background flow representing the colliding nuclei .",
    "viscous plots looked qualitatively similar and have not been included , for we have followed staig and shuryak @xcite in ignoring viscous corrections to the spectrum .",
    "gev differential power spectrum for @xmath145 .",
    "numerical error is smaller than the symbol size.,scaledwidth=97.0% ]    in figure [ fig : inviscid ] we see that the position of the first minimum of the power spectrum is not stable to changes in the initial radial position of the perturbation @xmath81 .",
    "increasing @xmath81 tends to shift the first minimum of the power spectrum to larger @xmath146 values .",
    "we observe the minimum to vary by two or three harmonics , which is broadly consistent with staig and shuryak @xcite . in what follows , however , we note a number of differences between their work and ours ( see , in particular the following two subsections [ subsec : compare ss ] and [ subsec : v_n over epsilon_n ] ) .",
    "it seems reasonable to conclude that the first minimum of the fixed @xmath147 differential power spectrum is not a stable observable , even in linear hydrodynamics .",
    "if one were to average over many events with multiple perturbations , there would not be a well - defined location of this first minimum .",
    "since real hydrodynamics is nonlinear , it seems doubtful that there will be a detectable first minimum to the fixed @xmath147 differential power spectrum in real heavy ion collision data .",
    "let us briefly digress in order to perform an error analysis of our method .",
    "there are two main sources of numerical error : a riemann sum was used in the integration process and the freezeout surface was truncated at the edge in order to not need to access times @xmath148 ( see the comparison subsection below for a discussion of this ) .",
    "the riemann sum error was estimated by performing sums with two different resolutions ; and the error associated with the truncation of the freezeout surface was was estimated by varying where this truncation was made , calculating the changes to the power spectra , and then extrapolating these changes to the edge of the freezeout surface .",
    "the total error was found to be @xmath149 , in the region plotted in figure [ fig : inviscid ] , with the larger errors associated to the minima of the power spectra .",
    "we have also tried to identify potential systematic errors in our study and found one issue that needs to be taken into account .",
    "first , recall that the gubser timelike coordinate @xmath41 is not the same as the physical proper time @xmath150 . from the coordinate transformations",
    ", one sees that the coordinate @xmath41 depends on both of the physical coordinates @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "this means that for a given freezeout surface there is a restricted range of @xmath64 that one must choose from in order to avoid needing information about the flow _ before _ the perturbation is initialized ( when calculating the cooper - frye freezeout integral , for example ) .",
    "figure [ fig : rho naught ] illustrates this effect .    0.45    0.45    on the left , the freezeout surface for @xmath152 mev is plotted . on the right ,",
    "the value of the coordinate @xmath41 is show for the points on the freezeout surface .",
    "we see that if we wish to avoid freezing out for @xmath148 at the edge of the freezeout surface , we mush either choose a @xmath64 sufficiently early , or only integrate out to a certain @xmath151 in the cooper - frye formula ; that is , ignore parts of the freezeout surface .",
    "since we wish to fix the @xmath153 coordinate of our perturbation to be @xmath154 , this leads to the necessary choice of ignoring the very edge of the freezeout surface . in order to keep this systematic error small , we chose to cut the freezeout surface between @xmath155 and @xmath156 in order to include as much of the features of the surface as possible .",
    "this allowed us to choose the @xmath81 value of the perturbation to be anything larger than about @xmath157 ( or , for @xmath143 mev , about @xmath158 fm ) .",
    "this is a rather large value , but bringing it closer to the center would have necessitated ignoring significant portions of the freezeout surface , and in turn would result in a large systematic error of our procedure .",
    "staig and shuryak @xcite have analyzed the same problem that we have outlined above as an initial value problem . in their paper",
    ", they found that the first minimum of the fixed @xmath147 differential power spectrum did not shift more than one harmonic as they varied the @xmath81 position between @xmath159 fm and @xmath160 fm , and the overall shape of the power spectra remained consistent as the coordinate was varied . despite the broadly consistent shape of the differential power spectra between our work and theirs ,",
    "there are some subtle differences in analysis . for this reason ,",
    "we highlight here the few differences between our analysis and that of staig and shuryak .",
    "staig and shuryak presumably evaluated the full cooper - frye integral with a saddle point approximation , where the integrand was evaluated at the maximum of the background exponent . in our analysis",
    ", we found that the integrand in the cooper - frye expression was not sharply peaked for every value of @xmath161 , the momentum angular coordinate , so a full calculation of the particle spectra was necessary .",
    "we evaluated the integral in full , using only a riemann sum in the @xmath151 coordinate ; our numerical errors due to this sum were discussed above .",
    "we also used a smaller value of @xmath54 than staig and shuryak .",
    "they chose to use @xmath162 , corresponding to an initial temperature of @xmath152 mev , in order to allow more time to evolve before freezeout .",
    "this changes the detailed shape of the power spectra , and shifts the peaks and minima somewhat , but it does not change our qualitative conclusion that the first minimum is not stable under variations in the initial coordinate @xmath81 of the hotspot .    finally , there is no mention in staig and shuryak s work of the systematic error introduced related to the cutting of the freeze - out surface ( see our discussion above ) .",
    "note , however , that they used values of @xmath81 that necessitate cutting a large portion of the freezeout surface to avoid freezing out for @xmath148 .      in this section",
    "we study the linear hydrodynamic response to the perturbations by calculating the ratio @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the initial eccentricities . again , for the initial eccentricities , we have used the normalization @xmath163 where here @xmath14 is the initial energy density , and the integrals are over the transverse plane of the collision .",
    "the hydrodynamic response of the system is frequently characterized by the ratio @xmath11 .",
    "we have calculated this ratio ; in particular we have calculated it for integrated @xmath10 over the @xmath147 range @xmath164 gev .",
    "this was performed with the weighting @xmath165 where the integrals are over @xmath164 gev .",
    "our results for the inviscid case are plotted in figure [ fig : inviscid response ] .",
    "the temperature of the fluid and width of the perturbation are identical to what was used in the corresponding plots above .",
    "we note here that the @xmath12 are ill - defined for the gubser flow , for @xmath166 , the background energy density , exhibits a power law decay . from the background temperature profile , we find the leading order behavior @xmath167 since the background energy density is independent of the azimuthal angle @xmath32 and the perturbation is a gaussian , we have that the numerators of the expression for @xmath12 are finite for every @xmath146 . on the other hand ,",
    "the denominators diverge for large enough @xmath146 , for they are given by @xmath168 if @xmath169 . in order to remedy this ,",
    "we have imposed a cutoff on the volume by only integrating to a finite @xmath170 .",
    "this cutoff , however , artificially causes the response to scale with @xmath170 as @xmath171 for @xmath169 .",
    "this consideration must be held in mind when examining the hydrodynamical response of the gubser flow . to aid with this",
    ", we have shaded the cutoff - dependent region in figure [ fig : inviscid response ] .",
    "using the gubser flow to model the energy density profile of the quark gluon plasma after a heavy ion collision was useful because it provided an analytical flow on which to do linear perturbations .",
    "however , it was not without its drawbacks .",
    "the gubser flow was conformal , whereas the flow in a real heavy ion collision is not , and there were limitations on where the original perturbation could be placed .",
    "the latter difficulty necessitated discarding small pieces of the freezeout surface in the cooper - frye integral .",
    "finally , real viscous hydrodynamics is inherently nonlinear , whereas the gubser analysis above only involved linear perturbations . with these shortcomings in mind ,",
    "we have conducted analysis of the @xmath10 coefficients using numerical hydrodynamics .",
    "the specific code used was the causal viscous hydro code for non - central heavy ion collisions version 0.5.2 by luzum and romatschke @xcite . on top of the central collision background energy density used in the code",
    ", a gaussian of width @xmath172 fm and height @xmath173 was added , again , so that the perturbation would be localized relative to the background energy density .",
    "figure [ fig : hydrocoderesponse ] shows the integrated response over the @xmath147 range @xmath174 gev of a system with @xmath175 as the initial radial position of the perturbation is varied between @xmath176 fm .",
    "the curves representing perturbations with smaller @xmath81 are    truncated at smaller @xmath146 .",
    "this is because smaller @xmath81 leads to smaller @xmath10 and @xmath12 , which the code could not accurately calculate with feasible lattice spacings .",
    "we did , however , run codes for multiple lattice spacings in order to get a sense of the errors .",
    "we have only plotted those points that have errors smaller than the symbol size on the plots .    from figure",
    "[ fig : hydrocoderesponse ] there does not appear to be a well - defined minimum until at least @xmath177 , except perhaps for the perturbation farthest from the symmetry axis .",
    "after averaging over many events with many initial perturbation locations , one would not expect to find a minimum for @xmath178 , which makes it doubtful that experiments would be able to detect one .    with this observation in mind",
    ", we turn to examining the proposed form for the response @xmath179 to see whether numerical hydrodynamics supports this simple dependence on @xmath2 .",
    "figure [ fig : varyetaos ] shows plots of @xmath11 for @xmath180 for perturbations centered at @xmath181 fm from the beamline . as expected , we see that @xmath9 decreases as @xmath2 increases .",
    "we note here , however , that there is not a noticeable change in slope as @xmath2 is varied , already placing strain on the proposed linear dependence . for each value of @xmath2",
    "we have fit @xmath182 to the form @xmath183 the proposed form of the response .",
    "since the coefficients @xmath184 are proposed to depend linearly on @xmath2 , we show in figure [ fig : fit etaos ] a linear fit to these ( @xmath2 , @xmath184 ) values for the @xmath185 fm and the @xmath186 fm cases . for each value of viscosity over entropy density ,",
    "we plot the @xmath184 value for the finest lattice spacing with error bars equal in size to the difference between the @xmath184 values for the finest and second finest lattice spacings ( most of which are too small to be seen on the plot ) .",
    "the @xmath187 form was found to fit the logarithm of the response for each viscosity over entropy ratio well , but we see from figure [ fig : fit etaos ] that as the position of the perturbation is varied , the slope of the best fit line changes dramatically .",
    "it would thus seem from this work that after many events are averaged over one would no longer expect to see this dependence of the response on @xmath146 and @xmath2 .",
    "we have used semi - analytical and numerical methods to investigate the hydrodynamical response of a heavy ion collision system with initial state perturbations .",
    "semi - analytically , using the gubser flow , we found that the first minimum of the response was sensitive to the location of the initial - state perturbation .",
    "moreover , this minimum was located in a region where the initial state eccentricities were ill - defined .",
    "numerically , we found that there did not appear to be a well - defined first minimum in the region @xmath178 . taking these results together ,",
    "we conclude that in the region @xmath178 , which includes the region accessible by experiment , there should not occur a sharp minimum of the response .",
    "furthermore , our investigations do not support the dependence of the measured response on @xmath146 and @xmath2 as @xmath188 for the slope in the linear fits of @xmath182 vs. @xmath2 varies with the location of the initial perturbation .",
    "in addition , for some locations , the linear dependence is not even observed .",
    "we thus find that many of the features thought to contain information about the medium will be washed out when averaging over many event locations , or at the very least they will be modified substantially .",
    "we have also described a method for calculating the green s functions for the @xmath18-independent , linearized gubser flow to first order in @xmath96 .",
    "this would allow one to examine the true two - point functions of this system at central rapidity .",
    "the method could also in principle be extended to remove the central rapidity restriction .",
