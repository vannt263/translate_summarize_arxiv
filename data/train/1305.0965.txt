    "namely , for a lattice @xmath0 , let @xmath3 denote the ordered set of principal congruences of @xmath0 .",
    "a congruence is _ principal _ if it is generated by a pair @xmath4 of elements .",
    "ordered sets and lattices with 0 and 1 are called _",
    "bounded_. clearly , if @xmath0 is a bounded lattice , then @xmath1 is a bounded ordered set . the pioneering theorem in grtzer  @xcite states the converse : each bounded ordered set @xmath5 is isomorphic to @xmath1 for an appropriate bounded lattice @xmath0 . actually , the lattice he constructed is of length 5 .",
    "up to isomorphism , he also characterized finite bounded ordered sets as the @xmath1 of finite lattices @xmath0 .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we follow the standard terminology and notation of lattice theory ; see , for example , grtzer  @xcite .",
    "our terminology for weak perspectivity is the classical one taken from grtzer  @xcite . _",
    "ordered sets _ are nonempty sets equipped with _ orderings _ , that is , with reflexive , transitive , antisymmetric relations .",
    "note that an ordered set is often called a _ partially ordered set _ , which is a rather long expression , or a _ poset _ , which is not tolerated by spell - checkers , or an _ order _ , which has several additional meanings .",
    "motivated by grtzer s theorem mentioned above , our goal is to prove the following theorem .",
    "a set @xmath6 is _ countable _ if it is finite or countably infinite , that is , if @xmath7 .",
    "an ordered set @xmath5 is _ directed _ if each two - element subset of @xmath5 has an upper bound in @xmath5 .",
    "nonempty down - sets of @xmath5 and subsets @xmath8 are called _ order ideals _ and _ principal @xmath9order@xmath10 ideals _ , respectively .",

    ", the rule @xmath19 implies that @xmath1 is always a directed ordered set with zero .",
    "therefore , the first part of the theorem will easily be concluded from the second one .",

    "first of all , we need the key idea , illustrated by figure  [ fig4 ] , from grtzer  @xcite .",
    "second , we feel that without the quasi - coloring technique developed in czdli  @xcite , the investigations leading to this paper would have not even begun . as opposed to colorings , the advantage of quasi - colorings is that we have joins ( equivalently , the possibility of generation ) in their range sets .",
    "this allows us to decompose our construction into a sequence of elementary steps .",
    "each step is accompanied by a quasiordering .",
    "if several steps , possibly infinitely many steps , are carried out , then the join of the corresponding quasiorderings gives a satisfactory insight into the construction .",
    "even if it is the `` coloring versions '' of some lemmas that we only use at the end , it is worth allowing their quasi - coloring versions since this way the proofs are simpler and the lemmas become more general .",
    "third , the idea of using appropriate auxiliary structures is taken from czdli  @xcite .",
    "their role is to accumulate all the assumptions our induction steps will need .",
    "the rest of the paper is devoted to the proof of theorem  [ thmmain ] .",
