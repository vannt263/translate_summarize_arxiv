    "the search for distant supernovae ( sne ) has been revolutionised in the last few years by two cosmology - oriented groups , the supernova cosmology project ( scp ; perlmutter et al .",
    "1997 ) , and the high@xmath21 sn search team ( schmidt et al .",
    "both groups have discovered hundreds of distant sne with redshifts up to @xmath22 , and beyond .",
    "analysis of these data shows evidence for an accelerating universe , possibly driven by a positive cosmological constant ( riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al .",
    "two likely high@xmath21 sne have also been discovered in a repeated observation with the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) of the hubble deep field ( hdf ; gilliland , nugent , & phillips 1999 ) .",
    "one of these sne has been shown by riess et al .",
    "( 2001 ) to be a type - ia at @xmath23 , at an epoch before the transition from deceleration to acceleration .",
    "a third possible sn candidate was detected in the original hdf data through the analysis of the time dependent flux variation of objects in this field ( mannucci & ferrara 1999 ) .",
    "these observations demonstrate that deep _",
    "observations are an efficient way to find high@xmath21 sne , with the high angular resolution and low sky background compensating for the small field of view .    apart from the use of type - ia sne as standard candles , it is important to find and characterise distant sne of all types .",
    "sn rates as a function of redshift probe the star formation history of the universe , the physical mechanisms leading to sn - ia explosions , and the cosmological parameters ( jorgensen et al .",
    "1997 ; sadat et al . 1998 ; ruiz - lapuente & canal 1998 ; madau , della valle , & panagia 1998 ; yungelson & livio 2000 ) .",
    "furthermore , even in the absence of redshift information , sn number counts as a function of limiting magnitude can provide valuable constraints ( dahln & fransson 1999 , hereafter df ; sullivan et al .",
    "2000 , hereafter s2000 ) .",
    "there are incentives to search for high@xmath21 sne not only in `` blank '' fields , but also in the fields of rich galaxy clusters .",
    "the lensing magnification of background sources by the cluster potentials enables detection of distant and intrinsically dim sources , that would be too faint to study otherwise .",
    "indeed , the natural telescopes provided by rich clusters have been used successfully for deep studies of high@xmath21 galaxies in the x - ray ( crawford et al . 2001 ) , optical ( e.g. , frye & broadhurst 1998 , pettini et al .",
    "2000 ) , ir ( e.g. , lemonon et al .",
    "1998 ) , and submm ( smail et al . 1998 ) regimes . following the same reasoning ,",
    "s2000 have considered the prospects of searching for high@xmath21 sne lensed by galaxy clusters .",
    "the most distant sne could be found , with implications both for the cosmological applications and for our understanding of the nature of sne .    lensed high@xmath21 sne behind galaxy clusters could also probe the properties of the cluster lenses .",
    "for instance , a magnified type - ia sn would provide a direct measurement of the cluster magnification , lifting the so called `` mass - sheet degeneracy '' encountered when deducing cluster masses from weak - lensing shear maps ( kolatt & bartelmann 1998 )",
    ". a sn in a host galaxy that is lensed by a cluster into a giant arc may be multiply imaged into three images with time delays of weeks to months ( kovner & paczynski 1988 ) .",
    "sne in galaxies that are nearly lensed into optical einstein rings , such as the cl0024 + 16 arc system ( tyson , kochanski , & dellantonio 1998 ) , may also have short time lags ( months to years ) between images of the sne in distinct galaxy images , providing constraints on the cluster mass distribution and on cosmological parameters .    finally ,",
    "knowledge of the rate of sne _ in _ the galaxy clusters , as a function of sn type and cluster redshift , could illuminate several puzzles concerning the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "one such puzzle is the total observed mass of iron , which is at least several times larger than that expected from sne , based on the present - day stellar masses , and assuming a standard stellar initial mass function ( imf ; e.g. , brighenti and mathews 1998 ; loewenstein 2000 ) .",
    "another is the energy budget of the icm gas and the `` entropy floor '' observed in clusters , which suggest a non - gravitational energy source to the icm , again several times larger than the expected energy input from sne ( e.g. , lloyd - davies , ponman , & cannon 2000 ; tozzi & norman 2001 ; brighenti & mathews 2001 ) .",
    "proposed solutions to these problems have included an imf skewed toward high - mass stars ( so that a large number of iron - enriching core - collapse sne are produced per present - day unit stellar luminosity ) , or a dominant role for sne - ia in the icm enrichment .",
    "the latter option would require early - type galaxies in clusters to have sn - ia rates much higher than observed in nearby field ellipticals .",
    "constraints on these scenarios can be obtained by directly measuring the sn rate in clusters at various redshifts .",
    "observationally , sn searches in galaxy clusters were pioneered in the late 1980 s by norgaard - nielsen et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , resulting in the first detection of a @xmath24 sn in the galaxy cluster ac118 .",
    "more recently , low - redshift cluster samples have been monitored for sne by the mount stromlo abell cluster sn search ( reiss et al .",
    "1998 ) and by the wise observatory optical transients search ( gal - yam & maoz 1999 , 2001 ) . to extend these efforts to higher@xmath21 clusters ,",
    "we have carried out a search for sne in duplicate deep cluster images in the _ hst _ archive . in this paper",
    ", we describe our discovery of six sne in this data set .",
    "we then use these sne to derive the sn - ia rate in clusters and to test the theoretical predictions for the non - cluster sn number counts in such fields . where applicable , we assume a flat cosmology with parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and use @xmath27 to denote the hubble parameter in units of 50 km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 .",
    "we have searched the _ hst _ archive for duplicate wfpc2 observations of galaxy cluster fields .",
    "clusters were identified as such by the target name , or , when the names were not revealing , by searching the ned database for known clusters near the field coordinates .",
    "the details of our final cluster sample are given in table 1 .",
    "for two wfpc2 observations to be considered duplicates , we required that they had been obtained through the same filter , and that the angular distance between their field centres was less than @xmath28 arcsec .",
    "the requirement for identical filters is due to the need for accurate image subtraction when searching for faint transients .",
    "the angular separation criterion is driven by the peculiar shape of the wfpc2 field , coupled with the random _ hst _ orientations , which can result in observations that are nominally duplicate , but have little overlap area .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,>,>,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     note : @xmath29 all quoted errors are @xmath30 .",
    "table 7 summarises our rate measurements and compares them to those available in the literature . in local elliptical galaxies ( which are the dominant population in the central regions of rich clusters ) , cappellaro et al .",
    "( 1997 ) find @xmath31  snu . among distant field galaxies , measured rates are @xmath32  snu at @xmath33 ( pain et al .",
    "1997 ) and @xmath34  snu at @xmath35 ( pain et al . 2002",
    "; see fabbro et al .",
    "2000 ) , where the quoted errors are @xmath30 .",
    "the sn - ia rates we have measured in the central regions of rich clusters at @xmath36 are not markedly different from the rates in the local elliptical population , or in the general field population at similar redshifts .",
    "as mentioned in  1 , a major motivation for measuring cluster sn rates is the possibility of addressing directly the puzzle of the large mass of iron and the excess entropy observed in clusters . for example , using gas - dynamical models for icm enrichment by sne , brighenti & mathews ( 1998 ) find that the cluster sn - ia rate must be @xmath37  snu today and @xmath38  snu at @xmath22 to explain production of most of the iron in the icm with sne - ia .",
    "these values are above our 95 per cent upper limits on the cluster sn - ia rates .",
    "we note , however , that the uncertainty in our measured rates is dominated by the large poisson errors resulting from small number statistics .",
    "even a slightly larger cluster sn sample could more critically test the validity of the sn - ia icm enrichment scenario .",
    "we have conducted a search for sne using data from deep observations of galaxy clusters from the _ hst _ archive , and have detected six point - like transient events . based on their observed characteristics and the known properties of different classes of variable objects ,",
    "we have argued that most or all of these events are sne . the redshifts and types of the likely host galaxies are available in the literature for five events , demonstrating the benefits of observing well - studied fields .",
    "folding in the observational parameters of our search , we have compared the numbers and magnitudes of the likely non - cluster ( i.e. , background or foreground ) sne we have found to published predictions of sn number counts .",
    "such predictions depend strongly on a number of poorly known ingredients , and in particular the luminosity function and extinction of core - collapse sne .",
    "the observed counts from our survey provide some initial constraints on these models .",
    "the observed counts , which are comparable to the predictions of df , but somewhat lower than those of s2000 , suggest that at @xmath39 , core - collapse sne are relatively faint , due to either extinction or to a luminosity distribution without a high - luminosity tail .",
    "however , being based on small sn numbers , these results should be treated with caution , and larger surveys , yielding significantly more events , are definitely called for .    we have used the candidate type - ia sne in the clusters to estimate the sn - ia rate in the central @xmath40  kpc of medium - redshift @xmath41 and high - redshift @xmath42 cluster sub - samples .",
    "the measured rates are consistent with sn - ia measurements in field environments , both locally and at high redshift .",
    "our results argue against an environmental dependence of the sn - ia rate . specifically , the observed low sn rate is in conflict with a scenario where sne - ia are the primary source of the large amounts of iron seen in the icms of massive clusters .",
    "this work shows that useful limits on high@xmath21 sn rates and counts can be derived from repeated , deep _",
    "hst _ imaging , even without any follow - up observations .",
    "the current dominant source of uncertainty is the poisson error due to small number statistics .",
    "next in importance are the lack of identification for some of the sne , and the uncertainties in cluster luminosities",
    ". obviously , similar analysis of a larger data set would yield sn rates and counts with higher precision , and planned observations ( rather than an archival search ) would enable some followup work that would reduce the systematic errors .",
    "such an expanded program would also improve the prospects of discovering and utilising gravitationally lensed sne , as outlined in  1 .",
    "excluding the search for sne in the hdf by gilliland et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , our search is the deepest sn survey conducted , and covers about 6 times the effective area of the hdf search .",
    "we find , on average , roughly one sn per deep ( @xmath1  mag ) duplicate wfpc2 cluster field , with about half of the sne in the clusters and half in the field . at these magnitudes",
    ", there is a high density of sne on the sky , detectable in significant numbers even in the small field of view of the _ hst _ cameras . finding these sne and characterising them ,",
    "even if only in an incomplete and statistical way , can provide input and constraints to many current issues in astronomy and cosmology .",
    "if you are about to carry out deep imaging , whether from space or from the ground , do not do it all at once !",
    "numerous sne are out there , and can be found simply by splitting the observations into two or more well - separated epochs .",
    "we thank p. nugent for kindly calculating and providing sn light - curve templates before publication , and helping to resolve the discrepancies in published sn count predictions .",
    "we also thank b. milvang - jensen and a. aragn - salamanca for kindly providing redshifts for galaxies in ms1054.4 - 0321 prior to publication .",
