    "the computer simulation of the behaviour of complex networks with a huge number of nodes , such as networks of neurons in some portion of the brain , is a formidable challenge .",
    "the intrinsic difficulties of such a task may be alleviated to some extent by identifying one or more multiscale structures within the networks ; this allows one to describe and simulate different scales by different models , while posing the problem of the interaction among scales .    within a multiscale framework ,",
    "the co - existence of discrete and continuous models is a natural option , which may lead to significant savings .",
    "higher - level nodes , or interactions , may be affordably given an individual description ( e.g. , by a system of coupled ordinary differential equations ) , whenever their number is small to moderate .",
    "on the contrary , this approach would be computationally prohibitive for the description of lower - level nodes or interactions , if their number is exceedingly large . in this case , a possible alternative may consist in modelling the huge population of individuals by a continuum , confined in some spatial region , and describe its behaviour by a limited number of variables , e.g. , submitted to satisfy partial differential equations .",
    "one recognizes here a process underlying the mathematical description of many physical phenomena , e.g. , in fluid dynamics .",
    "the derivation of a continuum model may be accomplished by `` passing to the limit '' in a discrete model , assuming that the number of individuals tends to infinity .",
    "the present paper aims at investigating one such limit process .",
    "specifically , the discrete model we start from is inspired by the connections of electrical ( rather than chemical ) nature within a neuronal network . in order to better motivate our model , we provide now some biological background .    despite in the past years",
    "almost all networks have been represented as constituted by neurons that are interconnected by chemical synapses , electrical synapses are largely present in the nervous system . in the sequel",
    ", we will use indifferently the terms _ electrical synapses _ and _ gap junctions_. however , for the sake of completeness , gap junctions are the morphological equivalent of electrical synapses .",
    "in particular , as specified in  @xcite , gap junctions exist between near - neighbour neurons and they allow low - resistance electrical transmissions .",
    "indeed , at an electrical synapse a current @xmath2 is generated which is proportional to the difference between the action potentials @xmath3 of the post - synaptic and pre - synaptic neurons ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite eq .",
    "( 7.12 ) ) ; explicitly , we have for some @xmath4 @xmath5 this establishes a _ diffusive coupling _ between neighbouring neurons .",
    "unfortunately , the analysis of electrical synapses _ in situ _ presents severe technical difficulties and therefore their specific roles are still largely unexplored . nevertheless , in the past ten years",
    ", the topic concerning gap junction networks has been object of several investigations , sometimes leading to paradoxical results ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .    in order to build up the sample network we will consider ,",
    "several ingredients are taken into account .",
    "first of all , we model each single cell as an excitable element by exploiting the fitzhugh - nagumo model ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the excitable feature means that neurons may not fire intrinsically without any synaptic inputs .",
    "furthermore , each cell belongs to the same functional class , avoiding the presence of heterogeneity .",
    "this agrees with authors in  @xcite who stress that electrical synapses exist exclusively between neurons of a specific class .",
    "in particular , despite many works underline the presence of electrical synapses between inhibitory neurons ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , the existence of electrical connections between excitatory neurons is demonstrated in the early postnatal stages ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "finally , as we will specify , we consider the presence of both bidirectional ( non - rectifying ) and unidirectional ( rectifying ) synapses as claimed in  @xcite .",
    "we now describe the content of this paper . after setting our mathematical model of an idealized neuronal network with electrical - type coupling between neurons",
    ", we carefully investigate the `` passage to the limit '' as the number of neurons tends to infinity , while they remain confined in a fixed and bounded spatial region .",
    "we identify two different manners of increasing the population of the network so that a non - trivial continuum limit is obtained .",
    "the first one assumes a fixed topology of the network ( nearest - neighbour connections ) but makes the proportionality coefficient in   to depend upon the total number of neurons according to a specific law ; conversely , the second manner keeps this coefficient fixed but suitably increases the number of connections per neuron .",
    "both methods lead to equivalent continuous models , in which the action potential is the solution of a reaction - diffusion partial differential equation ( or a reaction - convection - diffusion equation if connections are not symmetric , i.e. , if rectifying synapses are allowed ) .",
    "our arguments apply in any spatial dimension , although we detail them in 1d and we sketch their extension to 2d . clear numerical evidence confirms all theoretical results . at last ,",
    "an example of random connections is also presented .",
    "the fitzhugh - nagumo model  @xcite was introduced as a dimensional reduction of the well - known hodgkin - huxley model  @xcite .",
    "it extracts the hodgkin - huxley fast - slow phase plane and presents it in a simplified form .",
    "the resulting model is more analytically and numerically tractable and it maintains a certain biophysical meaning .",
    "the model is constituted by two equations in two variables @xmath3 and @xmath6 .",
    "the first one is the fast variable called _ excitatory _ : it represents the transmembrane voltage .",
    "the second variable is the slow _ recovery variable _ : it describes the time dependence of several physical quantities , such as the electrical conductance of the ion currents across the membrane .",
    "the fitzhugh - nagumo equations , using the notation in  @xcite , are given by : @xmath7 where , @xmath8 are parameters of the model .",
    "the model describes neurons as excitable elements which have two key properties .",
    "firstly , they are characterized by their excitability behaviour : a sufficiently large stimulus provokes a very large response , that is , a small perturbation to the quiescent state of a neuron can provoke a large excursion of its potential .",
    "secondly , they are characterized by their refractoriness : the elements can not be excited during the period which follows the stimulus .    throughout the paper , following  @xcite , we will adopt the fitzhugh - nagumo model with @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , to describe the behaviour of each neuron in our network .",
    "we suppose that our network contains @xmath0 neurons , identified by integer labels @xmath12 ; labels may refer to the physical position of the neurons , but other ways to index neurons could be used in a more convenient way .",
    "electrical - type connections in the neuronal network are easily described by basic concepts from graph theory ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "let us consider a graph @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the set of vertices and @xmath15 is the set of edges . the so - called _ adjacency matrix _",

    "we assume that the network is contained in a bounded region @xmath40 ( independent of @xmath0 ) of the euclidean space @xmath41 , for some @xmath42 ; let us denote by @xmath43 the physical position of the @xmath21th neuron .",
    "then , we assume that the distance of any point @xmath44 from the network tends to zero as @xmath39 , and the distance of each neuron from its neighbours in the network has a similar behaviour .",
    "if interactions between neurons are local , we can give an expression of the diffusive term in   which is based on the taylor expansion of the differences @xmath45 .",
    "precisely , let us assume that at each time there exists a sufficiently smooth function @xmath3 defined in @xmath40 such that @xmath46 for @xmath12 . then , setting @xmath47 , we have @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the gradient vector of @xmath3 , whereas @xmath50 denotes the hessian matrix of @xmath3 . substituting this expression into  ,",
    "we obtain a representation of the diffusive term by which we can find the conditions on the coefficient @xmath51 and/or the sets @xmath32 ( depending on the network ) yielding a non - trivial limit as @xmath39 .",
    "we will detail our analysis assuming a specific distribution of neurons in the one - dimensional case first , and then we will consider the multi - dimensional extension .",

    "let us first consider two symmetric nearest - neighbour interactions for each neuron .",
    "this translates in considering the set of connections per neuron @xmath59 . in this case",

    "specifically , its action potential is initially set to the value @xmath62 , whereas all the other variables are set to @xmath63 .",
    "considering the diffusion coefficient @xmath64 ( see  @xcite ) , the resulting dynamics is constituted by two pulses that travel in opposite directions in the whole set of neurons ( see e.g.  @xcite for the analysis of travelling pulses ) .",
    "a sample dynamics is shown in figure  [ fig : links2d1 ] .",
    "we observe for further reference that a similar dynamics is obtained starting from an initial stimulus of the action potential given by a gaussian function concentrated around the central neuron . in all cases , at the end of dynamics , neurons return to the quiescent state .",
    "in fact , neurons are modelled as excitable units and then , after the excitation , they undergo a long refractory period . in this period",
    "they are blind to any stimulus .",
    "this is the reason why two travelling pulses that collide depress their signals .",
    "+   +    we now focus on how the dynamics produced by our model depends upon @xmath0 .",
    "the first observation is that , if the diffusion parameter @xmath51 is kept fixed , then the diffusive effect tends to vanish as @xmath39 .",
    "this can be seen in two ways . on the one hand ,",
    "if neurons get close to each other and the action potential varies in a smooth manner , then the differences on the right - hand side of   tend to zero , implying the vanishing of the diffusion term @xmath65 in each node . on the other hand , considering the test case introduced above , it is easily seen that the effect of , say , doubling @xmath0 is equivalent to have a chain of neurons with the same spacing but with double length ; this means that on the original chain , waves have half the length and propagate with half the speed .    in order to obtain non - trivial diffusion effects in the limit , one possibility - that we call approach i - consists in letting the parameter @xmath51 grow with @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath66 .",
    "the precise dependence can be found by exploiting the taylor expansion  , which in the present setting becomes @xmath67 where the prime indicates differentiation with respect to the spatial variable @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , the following expression holds for the diffusive term : @xmath69=d_n[\\delta",

    "hence , we obtain @xmath74 i.e. , @xmath70 is proportional to the square of the number of neurons .",
    "the fact that @xmath70 is proportional to @xmath75 is not surprising : the spectral gap of the laplacian matrix has the same behaviour as @xmath76 .    as @xmath39 , the discrete model @xmath77\\;,\\\\",

    "note that the first equation is similar to the so - called cable equation , which describes the distribution of the potential along the axon of a single neuron ( see , e.g.  @xcite )",
    ". reaction - diffusion models like   are studied e.g. in  @xcite .",
    "we observe that the discrete model   can be viewed as a numerical semi - discretization ( in space ) of the pde system  , obtained by using a second - order centered finite difference method on the equally - spaced  .",
    "thus , if the solution of   is sufficiently smooth as in the case of an initial gaussian stimulus , we expect to have quadratic convergence in @xmath89 of the discrete solutions , at any fixed time @xmath90 , as it can be deduced from the fact that the error term on the right - hand side of   is proportional to @xmath91 .",
    "we now give an example . following the choice of parameters presented in  @xcite ,",

    "the ( b ) plots clearly document the convergence of the discrete dynamics towards a limit one .",
    "note that these dynamics are generated by applying an initial stimulus @xmath95 to a number of neurons proportional to @xmath0 around the center of the chain ; in the limit , the initial action potential takes the value @xmath62 in an interval of positive length symmetrically placed around the point @xmath96 , and vanishes elsewhere .",
