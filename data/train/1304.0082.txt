    "have attract the attention of many mathematicians , physicists and engineers  see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the reason is that real phenomena , such as dielectric and electrode - electrolyte polarization , electromagnetic waves , earthquakes , fluid dynamics , traffic , viscoelasticity and viscoplasticity , can be described successfully and more accurately using fractional models  see @xcite .",
    "fractional evolution equations with nonlocal conditions have been studied in many works  see @xcite and references therein .",
    "existence results to evolution equations with nonlocal conditions in a banach space were first studied in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that , using the nonlocal condition @xmath28 to describe , for instance , the diffusion phenomenon of a small amount of gas in a transparent tube , can give better results than using the standard local cauchy condition @xmath29 . according to @xcite , function @xmath30 takes the form @xmath31 , where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , are given constants and @xmath34 . in @xcite the controllability of semilinear fractional differential equations with nonlocal conditions in a banach space is investigated through the mnch fixed point theorem , where the semigroup generated by the linear part is not necessarily compact but the nonlinear term satisfies some weak compactness condition .",
    "the existence of mild solutions for impulsive fractional evolution cauchy problems involving caputo fractional derivatives is discussed in @xcite by means of the theory of operators semigroup and probability density functions via impulsive conditions , while the solvability and optimal control of a class of fractional integrodifferential evolution systems with an infinite delay in banach spaces is studied in @xcite : a concept for solution is introduced , existence and continuous dependence of solutions are investigated , and existence of optimal controls proved . in @xcite optimal feedback control laws for lagrange problems subject to semilinear fractional - order systems in banach spaces are established .",
    "exact controllability of fractional order systems has been proved by many authors : @xcite .",
    "the main tool is to convert the controllability question into a fixed point problem with the assumption that the controllability operator has an induced inverse on a quotient space . to prove controllability , an assumption that the semigroup ( resp .",
    "resolvent operator ) associated with the linear part is compact is then often made . however ,",
    "if the compactness condition holds on the bounded operator that maps the control function or the generated @xmath35-semigroup , then the controllability operator is also compact and its inverse does not exist if the state space is infinite dimensional  see @xcite . thus , the concept of exact controllability is too strong in infinite dimensional spaces and the approximate controllability notion is more appropriate .",
    "approximate controllability of integer order systems has been proved in several works .",
    "in contrast , papers dealing with the approximate controllability of fractional order systems are scarce .",
    "recently , the subject was addressed in @xcite , while sufficient conditions for the ( delay ) approximate controllability of fractional order systems , in which the nonlinear term depends on both state and control variables , are investigated in @xcite , and the case of partial neutral fractional functional differential systems with a state - dependent delay is considered in @xcite .",
    "our main objective is to study the approximate controllability of semilinear fractional control systems , where the control function depends on multi - delay arguments and where the nonlocal condition is fractional .",
    "the result is obtained under the assumption that the associated linear system is approximately controllable . in particular , the controllability question is transformed to a fixed point problem for an appropriate nonlinear operator in a function space . for that we need to construct a suitable set of sufficient conditions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec:2 ] , we present some essential definitions of fractional calculus and basic facts in the semigroup theory that will be used to obtain our main results . in section  [ sec:3 ] , we state and prove existence and approximate controllability results for problem . finally , in section  [ sec:4 ] we illustrate the new results of the paper with an example .",

    "let us take the operators @xmath223 and @xmath224 as follows : @xmath225 such that the control function is @xmath226 , where @xmath227\\times j\\rightarrow [ 0,\\pi]$ ] is continuous , the multi - delays @xmath228 , @xmath229 , @xmath230 , @xmath231 , @xmath232 , and the nonlocal function is given by @xmath233 .",
