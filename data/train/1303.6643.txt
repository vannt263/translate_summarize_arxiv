    "a surface in a triangulated 3-manifold is _ normal _ if it intersects each tetrahedron transversally in a collection of flat triangles and quadrilaterals .",
    "h. kneser introduced normal surfaces to show that the prime decomposition of a 3-manifold is finite @xcite .",
    "many years later , w. haken used normal surfaces to give the first algorithm to determine if a knot is the unknot , and to show that any collection of pairwise disjoint , non - parallel incompressible surfaces is finite @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the key to this latter proof was to show that any incompressible surface can be isotoped to a normal surface .    in 1993",
    ", rubinstein introduced the idea of an _ almost normal _ surface .",
    "such a surface meets each tetrahedron of a triangulated 3-manifold in a collection of normal disks ( triangles or quadrilaterals ) , with the single exception of a disk whose boundary meets the 1-skeleton eight times ( i.e. an octagon ) or two normal disks connected by a single unknotted tube .",
    "rubinstein @xcite and thompson @xcite used almost normal surfaces to produce an algorithm to determine if a given 3-manifold is @xmath1 . subsequently rubinstein @xcite and stocking @xcite used almost normal surfaces to produce an algorithm to determine the heegaard genus of a given 3-manifold .",
    "more recently , li used almost normal surfaces to prove the generalized waldhausen conjecture @xcite : any closed , atoroidal 3-manifold admits finitely many heegaard splittings of each genus .",
    "the key to these results is to show that any _ strongly irreducible _ @xcite heegaard splitting is isotopic to an almost normal surface .",
    "these results illustrate the idea that a  normal form \" for a particular class of surfaces with respect to an arbitrary triangulation enables proofs of both algorithmic and finiteness results . in @xcite ,",
    "the author introduced the idea of _ topologically minimal surfaces _ as a way of generalizing both incompressible and strongly irreducible surfaces .",
    "such surfaces have an _ index _ , with index 0 surfaces being incompressible and index 1 surfaces being strongly irreducible . given the aforementioned results , the obvious question is ,  can every topologically minimal surface be isotoped to some normal form ? \" resolving this question is the purpose of the present series of papers .",
    "in the first paper in this series @xcite we reduced the problem to a local one . in that work , we showed that a topologically minimal surface with index @xmath0 in a triangulated 3-manifold can be transformed - compression , and some compressions .",
    "compressions that arise are very constrained , only happen when @xmath0 is at least three , and reduce the index . ] to one that meets each tetrahedron in a surface with a well - defined _ local index_. furthermore , the sum of these local indices , taken over all tetrahedra , will be at most @xmath0 .",
    "what remains , then , is to classify all surfaces in a tetrahedron with well - defined local index .    in the second paper in this series",
    "@xcite we obtained a complete classification of simply connected surfaces in a tetrahedron with local index @xmath0 .",
    "there we showed that such a surface must look like a helicoid , and the boundary of such a surface will meet the 1-skeleton precisely @xmath2 times .",
    "this result bears a striking resemblance with colding and minicozzi s classification of the local picture of a geometrically minimal surface that is simply connected @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in this final paper",
    ", we study the general case of surfaces in a tetrahedron @xmath3 with local index @xmath0 .",
    "our goal here is to show that there is a finite number of possibilities for such a surface .",
    "the results of this paper can all be summarized in the following theorem .",
    "[ t : summary ] let @xmath4 be a surface in a tetrahedron @xmath3 with local index @xmath0",
    ". then    1 .",
    "@xmath4 is unknotted and the components of @xmath4 are not nested .",
    "@xmath5 where the sum is taken over all components @xmath6 of @xmath4 .",
    "each component of @xmath4 has well - defined local index , and the sum of these indices is precisely @xmath0 .",
    "4 .   if @xmath7 is a component of @xmath4 then @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the local index of @xmath7 .",
    "the results of this theorem imply that there are a finite number of possibilities for a surface in a tetrahedron with local index @xmath0 .",
    "for example , when @xmath10 the theorem implies that the surface @xmath4 must be a collection of disks with boundary length 3 or 4 .",
    "this recovers the proof that any incompressible surface can be isotoped to a normal surface . when @xmath11 the above result implies that there is at most one component of @xmath4 that is not a normal triangle or quadrilateral .",
    "this component can either be a disk or an annulus , and the total length of its boundary is at most 8 .",
    "hence , the exceptional component is either a disk with boundary length 8 , or an unknotted annulus connecting two loops that have length 3 or 4 . taken with the results from the prequels ,",
    "this recovers rubinstein and stocking s result that any strongly irreducible surface can be isotoped to an almost normal one .",
    "the index 2 case is of particular interest , as it has immediate consequences that were not previously known .",
    "theorem [ t : summary ] implies that a ( connected ) surface in a tetrahedron with local index @xmath12 is either :    1 .   a disk with boundary of length 12 ( i.e.  a 12-gon ) .",
    "2 .   three normal disks , connected by two unknotted tubes , to form a pair - of - pants .",
    "3 .   an octagon connected to a normal triangle by an unknotted tube .",
    "4 .   an octagon connected to itself by an unknotted tube to form a punctured torus .",
    "5 .   a 12-gon connected to itself by an unknotted tube to form a punctured torus .",
    "although theorem [ t : summary ] does not rule out this last surface as a possible index 2 picture , we conjecture that it is not .",
    "this illustrates an important point : theorem [ t : summary ] only gives a finite set of surfaces that contains all possible ones that have local index @xmath0 .",
    "however , it is likely the case that not all of the surfaces in this set will have the desired index . despite this , the theorem does establish that for each local index the possibilities are finite , which is what is necessary for applications .",
    "for example taken with theorem 1.2 of @xcite and lemma 2.10 of @xcite , we obtain the following result :    [ c : finiteslopes ] let @xmath13 be a compact , irreducible 3-manifold with incompressible , connected , toroidal boundary .",
    "then there is a finite set of slopes @xmath14 on @xmath15 such that the boundary slope of any non - peripheral , topologically minimal , index @xmath0 surface in @xmath13 is at a distance of at most @xmath0 ( as measured in the farey graph ) from @xmath14 .",
    "choose any triangulation @xmath16 of @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath4 be a topologically minimal surface of index @xmath0 in @xmath13 . by theorem 1.2 of @xcite ,",
    "if @xmath4 is not peripheral then we can isotope , compress and @xmath17-compress @xmath4 to a surface @xmath7 such that the local indices of @xmath18 sum to at most @xmath0 , where @xmath19 are the tetrahedra of @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , the slope of @xmath20 will be at most distance @xmath0 ( as measured in the farey graph ) from the slope of @xmath21 ( see remark 2.18 of @xcite ) . by theorem [ t : summary ] , for each @xmath22",
    ", each component of the surface @xmath23 is of bounded length , and thus @xmath7 is in one of a finite number of _ compatibility classes _ ( see definition 2.5 of @xcite ) .",
    "lemma 2.10 in @xcite implies that each such compatibility class determines a unique slope on @xmath15 ( see in particular the paragraph following the proof of this lemma ) .",
    "this result , together with theorem 4.9 of @xcite then implies the following , which says roughly that if manifolds @xmath24 and @xmath25 with toroidal boundary are glued together by a  sufficiently complicated \" map , then no new index @xmath0 surfaces are created .",
    "[ c : barrier ] let @xmath24 and @xmath25 be compact , irreducible 3-manifolds with incompressible , connected , toroidal boundary .",
    "let @xmath26 be an homeomorphism , and @xmath27 be any anosov map .",
    "then there is a value @xmath28 depending only on @xmath0 such that for all @xmath29 , any topologically minimal , index @xmath0 surface in the manifold @xmath30 is isotopic into @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath31 and @xmath32 be the finite sets of slopes on @xmath33 and @xmath34 guaranteed by corollary [ c : finiteslopes ] , so that if @xmath35 and @xmath36 are surfaces with topological index @xmath0 , then their boundaries are at most distance @xmath0 from @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "choose @xmath28 so that if @xmath29 , then the set @xmath32 is at least distance @xmath37 from the set @xmath38 in the farey graph of @xmath34 .",
    "now suppose @xmath4 is an index @xmath0 surface in @xmath39 that is not isotopic into either @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath40 be the image of @xmath34 in this manifold .",
    "by theorem 4.9 of @xcite , @xmath4 may be isotoped to meet @xmath40 transversally away from @xmath41 saddle points , so that the sum of the indices of the components of @xmath42 is at most @xmath43 . in particular , there are components @xmath35 and @xmath36 of @xmath42 whose indices are at most @xmath0 . furthermore ,",
    "@xmath44 and @xmath45 are essential on @xmath40 , and come from @xmath46 by resolving @xmath41 saddle points .",
    "it follows that these loops are disjoint , and since @xmath40 is a torus , must actually be the same .",
    "we now apply corollary [ c : finiteslopes ] , which says that @xmath44 is at a distance of at most @xmath0 from @xmath31 , and @xmath45 is distance at most @xmath0 from @xmath32 .",
    "since @xmath47 , we conclude the distance between @xmath32 and @xmath38 is at most @xmath48 , contradicting our choice of @xmath28 .    in corollary 11.2 of @xcite",
    "we constructed the first example of a manifold that contains a non - minimal genus , unstabilized , weakly reducible heegaard splitting . by using corollary [ c : barrier ]",
    ", we can improve this construction to show that there is a manifold that contains an infinite number of such splittings .",
    "there is a closed 3-manifold @xmath13 that contains infinitely many non - isotopic , unstabilized heegaard splittings that are weakly reducible ( i.e.  splittings whose hempel distance is precisely one ) .    in the parlance of @xcite , corollary [ c : barrier ]",
    "establishes that if @xmath24 and @xmath25 are manifolds with toroidal boundary that are glued by a sufficiently complicated homeomorphism , then the torus @xmath40 at their interface is a  @xmath49-barrier surface \" for all index 0 , 1 , and 2 surfaces , regardless of the genus @xmath49 .",
    "thus , the conclusion of theorem 11.1 of @xcite holds , regardless of the genus of the surface @xmath6 .",
