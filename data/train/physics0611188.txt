    "the mathematical theory of minority games ( mgs ) with @xmath4 strategies per agent , particularly for what concerns their ergodic behaviour , largely rests on the possibility of separating the contribution to macroscopic quantities coming from `` frozen '' agents from that of `` fickle '' ones @xcite .",
    "frozen agents are those who use just one of their strategies asymptotically , whereas fickle agents flip between their strategies even in the steady state .",
    "that these two groups have different impact on the physical properties of mgs is clear if one thinks that frozen agents are insensitive to small perturbations and thus they do not contribute to the susceptibility of the system .",
    "more generally , when agents dispose of @xmath5 strategies each , the relevant quantity to calculate is the probability with which an agent uses @xmath2 of his strategies ( @xmath6 ) , knowledge of which provides all interesting physical observables . on the technical level , this is a rather complicated problem that has been tackled only recently in @xcite for the canonical @xmath0-strategy batch mg .",
    "here we propose an alternative method to derive the desired statistics in generic canonical or grand - canonical @xcite settings with @xmath0 strategies per agent .",
    "this approach has the advantage of being simpler from a mathematical viewpoint and , as we will show , easily exportable to other versions of the mg . as in @xcite",
    ", we resort to path - integral techniques , allowing for a description of the multi - agent dynamics in terms of the behavior of a single , effective agent subject to a non - trivially correlated noise . the central idea of the method we propose",
    "is to exchange the integration over the effective noise for one over frequencies using a simple invertible mapping from one set of variables to the other and the transformation law of probability distributions .",
    "we show that available theories are easily recovered in known cases and , as a further application , solve the strategy frequency problem for the grand - canonical mg with @xmath3 .",
    "since a similar issue arises in the context of multi - asset mgs @xcite , we also discuss the ( straightforward though heavier from a notational viewpoint ) generalisation of this idea to models in which traders may invest in @xmath7 assets .",
    "since path integrals are by now a somewhat standard technique to deal with mgs , we shall skip mathematical details and focus our analysis on the resulting effective dynamics and specifically on the strategy frequency problem",
    ". moreover , we shall reduce the discussion of the economic meaning of the model to the minimum .",
    "the interested reader will find extensive accounts in @xcite .",
    "we consider a market for a single asset with @xmath8 agents , labeled by @xmath9 . at each time",
    "step @xmath10 , agents receive an information pattern @xmath11 chosen randomly and independently with uniform probability and , based on this , they formulate their bids ( represented simply by a variable encoding the agent s decision , e.g. to buy or sell the asset ) .",
    "the most interesting phenomenology is obtained when @xmath12 scales linearly with @xmath8 ; their ratio , denoted as @xmath13 , is the model s main control parameter .",
    "every agent @xmath14 disposes of @xmath0 trading strategies @xmath15 , each prescribing a binary action @xmath16 , drawn randomly and uniformly , and independently for each strategy @xmath17 and pattern @xmath18 .",
    "the performance of every strategy is monitored by a score function @xmath19 which is updated by @xmath20 here , @xmath21 are real constants representing positive or negative incentives for the agents to trade , with a factor @xmath22 ensuring a non - trivial behavior in the limit @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 is instead the ( normalized ) excess demand at time @xmath10 , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the bid formulated by agent @xmath14 at time @xmath10 .",
    "if we denote by @xmath27 the strategy chosen by @xmath14 at time @xmath10 , then the bid submitted by @xmath14 is given by @xmath28 the terms @xmath29 impose that the agent performs the action dictated by his selected strategy .",
    "the term @xmath30 $ ] , with @xmath31 , denotes a filter linked to the score of the selected strategies .",
    "we focus our attention on two cases :    * taking @xmath32 to be the heaviside function , one has @xmath33 so that the filter consists in either submitting ( @xmath34 for @xmath35 ) or not submitting ( @xmath36 for @xmath37 ) the bid .",
    "this version of the game is usually called grand - canonical mg @xcite . *",
    "if @xmath38 , the filter is absent and agents are forced to play no matter how bad their scores perform .",
    "this corresponds to the standard canonical mg .",
    "it remains to describe how @xmath27 is chosen .",
    "we assume generically that at each time step agent @xmath14 employs a rule described by a function @xmath39 , namely @xmath40\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for example , the standard mg with @xmath3 corresponds to @xmath41 .",
    "( this generalises easily to the case of traders with decision noise @xcite . ) at this stage , we assume that the @xmath39 s are chosen randomly and independently across agents ( from some distribution ) and introduce the density of the mappings @xmath42 as @xmath43=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i\\in\\mathbb{z}_n}\\delta_{(f)}(g- g_i)\\ ] ] with @xmath44 a functional dirac delta .",
    "a similar random choice is made for incentives ( albeit in general with a different and uncorrelated distribution ) and we define their density as @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "we will work out the ` batch ' version of the model , which is obtained by averaging ( [ on - line ] ) over information patterns @xcite .",
    "after a time re - scaling ( we denote the re - scaled time as @xmath47 ) , one obtains the ` batch ' dynamics @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a ( small ) external perturbation added for later use . in dynamical studies , one is interested in the average bid autocorrelation function @xmath50_{dis}\\ ] ] and in the average response function @xmath51_{dis}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 and @xmath53_{dis}$ ] denote , respectively , averages over paths and disorder . assuming that @xmath54 for all @xmath14 , in the limit @xmath23 the multi - agent dynamics ( [ batch ] ) can be described in terms of a self - consistent stochastic process for a single , effective agent endowed with @xmath0 strategies , characterized by score functions @xmath55 , `` spin '' variable @xmath56 $ ] and filter @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "this process can be derived by introducing a generating function of the original dynamics and averaging over disorder @xcite .",
    "details of the calculation follow closely those of similar models reported in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
