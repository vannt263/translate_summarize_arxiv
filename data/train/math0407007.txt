    "rook polynomials provide a method of enumerating permutations with restricted position . their study was begun in 1946 by kaplansky and riordan  @xcite , with applications to card - matching problems .",
    "riordan s 1958 book  @xcite is considered the first systematic analysis , and remains a classic treatment of the subject . a series of papers by goldman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) in the 1970s expanded the field by applying more advanced combinatorial methods .    in this paper",
    ", we shall wish to restrict our attention to the class of ferrers boards . since 1975 ( @xcite ) these have occupied a prominent place in the literature .",
    "this is principally due to the depth and variety of the connections ferrers boards exhibit to other parts of mathematics .",
    "ferrers boards are related to chromatic polynomials @xcite , algebraic geometry @xcite , hypergeometric series @xcite , permutation statistics @xcite , quantum mechanical operators @xcite , and several types of digraph polynomials @xcite .",
    "such diverse applications make the inverse problem an especially pressing question for ferrers boards .    in this paper",
    ", we solve the inverse problem completely for ferrers boards .",
    "our proof is constructive , and using the foata - schtzenberger theorem  @xcite , we show that the board thus constructed is unique within the subclass of increasing ferrers boards .",
    "let @xmath0 be a generalized chessboard  a set of cells arranged in rows and columns .",
    "the rook is a chess piece which attacks on rows and columns ; by a rook placement we shall mean a non - attacking placement of @xmath1 indistinguishable rooks on the board @xmath0 .",
    "this intuitive definition can be formalized in several ways .",
    "a board @xmath0 may be regarded as a subset of @xmath2\\times [ 1,2,\\ldots , n]$ ] for some @xmath3 .",
    "a rook placement on @xmath0 then corresponds to a choice of @xmath1 elements of @xmath0 , @xmath4 such that @xmath5 or @xmath6 implies @xmath7 .",
    "alternatively , let @xmath8 $ ] be an arbitrary subset .",
    "then a rook placement is an injective function @xmath9 $ ] such that , for any @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath0 may also be seen as an element of @xmath12 $ ] , an @xmath13 matrix with binary entries .",
    "we write in this case @xmath14 . in this interpretation",
    ", a placement of @xmath1 rooks on @xmath0 corresponds to a choice of @xmath1 independent 1 s in @xmath0 .",
    "a third formalization is to regard @xmath0 as a bipartite graph on vertex sets @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath16 $ ] , where the graph contains edge @xmath17 iff @xmath17 is a cell in the corresponding chessboard .",
    "a rook placement then corresponds to a partial matching on the graph .    in this paper",
    ", we will not often need to invoke any of these formalizations .",
    "insofar as we use any of them , we will think of a board as an @xmath18 binary matrix ; this serves to ground the intuitive concepts of ` row ' and ` column ' , as well as providing a convenient notation for identifying individual cells .",
    "the ( classical ) rook polynomial of a board @xmath0 is the ordinary generating function @xmath19 where the coefficient @xmath20 is the number of placements of @xmath1 rooks on @xmath0 . when its omission will cause no confusion",
    ", we will assume the variable to be @xmath21 , and will simply write @xmath22 .",
    "( after goldman et al . in @xcite ) for @xmath23 , the @xmath24-factorial rook polynomial of a board @xmath0 is defined as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the falling factorial @xmath27 . as with the classical rook polynomial , we shall usually assume the variable @xmath21 and write @xmath28 .",
    "a ferrers board is a board made up of a sequence of adjacent solid columns of nondecreasing height , with a common lower edge .",
    "( we shall find it convenient to allow columns of zero height . )",
    "if the sequence of column heights is strictly increasing , the board is called an increasing ferrers board .    as a binary matrix",
    ", @xmath14 is a ferrers board if there exists a nondecreasing sequence of nonnegative integers @xmath29 such that @xmath30 if and only if @xmath31 .",
    "two boards @xmath32,@xmath0 are said to be rook equivalent if @xmath33 .",
    "a sufficient condition for rook equivalence is that @xmath0 can be obtained from @xmath32 by permutation of rows and columns .",
    "( this condition is not necessary , as demonstrated by the two boards in figure  [ equivalent - boards ] . )    .,title=\"fig : \" ] .,title=\"fig : \" ]    several immediate observations can be made regarding the coefficients @xmath20 of a rook polynomial .",
    "let @xmath0 be a board , and let @xmath34 be its rook polynomial .    1",
    ".   @xmath35 for all @xmath1 .",
    "2 .   @xmath36 implies @xmath37 for all @xmath38 .",
    "3 .   @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath40 , the number of cells in @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath41 for all @xmath1",
    "@xmath42 for all @xmath43 .",
    "most of these are immediate . for the last , note that any placement of @xmath1 rooks gives rise to @xmath1 placements of @xmath44 rooks , by removing each rook in turn . for @xmath45 ,",
    "any pair of such ( @xmath44)-placements is sufficient to uniquely determine a @xmath1-placement .",
    "an upper bound for the number of placements of @xmath1 rooks is therefore @xmath46 .",
    "these conditions are necessary , but not sufficient , for a given polynomial to be the rook polynomial of some board .",
    "for instance , @xmath47 and @xmath48 satisfy all the above conditions , but are not rook polynomials . in the next section , we establish conditions which are both necessary and sufficient for a polynomial to be the rook polynomial of a ferrers board .",
    "we shall need the following definitions and results :    ( after @xcite ) let @xmath0 be a ferrers board with @xmath49 columns , of heights @xmath50 .",
    "we define the height vector @xmath51 to be @xmath52 . for @xmath53",
    "we define the @xmath24-height vector @xmath54 to be @xmath55 , where @xmath56 for @xmath57 and @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "we also define the @xmath24-structure vector @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "consider the following ferrers board .",
    "the height vector of @xmath0 is @xmath62 .",
    "its @xmath63-height vector is @xmath64 , and its @xmath63-structure vector is @xmath65 .",
    "note that , as shown in this example , @xmath54 corresponds to placing a set of @xmath66 columns of zero height to the left of @xmath0 , and that the components of @xmath67 correspond to heights above or below the diagonal of this augmented board ( the dotted line shown ) .",
    "[ factorization ] let @xmath0 be a ferrers board with @xmath49 columns .",
    "for @xmath53 , let @xmath68 be the @xmath24-factorial rook polynomial of @xmath0 , and @xmath69 be the @xmath24-structure vector of @xmath0 . then @xmath70    [ goldman et al .",
    "@xcite ] two ferrers boards are rook equivalent if and only if , for some @xmath24 , their @xmath24-factorial rook polynomials are equal .    [ increasing ] every ferrers board is rook equivalent to a unique increasing ferrers board .    for any @xmath71",

    "the number of cells in this triangle is @xmath78 , so we have @xmath79 since @xmath80 , this gives @xmath81        now we are ready to state the main theorem of this section .",

    "let @xmath84 , and let @xmath85 be the n - factorial polynomial associated with @xmath86 .",
    "@xmath86 is the rook polynomial of an increasing ferrers board @xmath0 if and only if the following conditions are satisfied :    1 .",
    "@xmath87 has only integer roots .",
    "@xmath88 divides @xmath87 , where @xmath89 is the largest root of @xmath87 .",
    "furthermore , if it exists @xmath0 is unique , and has column height vector @xmath90 , where @xmath91 are the ( possibly repeated ) roots of @xmath92 , arranged in nonincreasing order .",
    "assume such a board @xmath0 exists .",
    "then it must have @xmath93 cells , so by lemma  [ columns ] it has no more than @xmath24 columns .",
    "the @xmath24-structure vector of any increasing ferrers board is of the form @xmath94 with @xmath95 . by the hypothesis that @xmath96",
    ", @xmath87 is the @xmath24-factorial rook polynomial of @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , by theorem  [ factorization ] , @xmath97 thus , @xmath88 divides @xmath87 , and all the roots of @xmath87 are integers . by theorem  [ increasing ] , @xmath0 is unique , and it follows from the definitions that @xmath0 has the column heights stated",
    ".    for the converse , assume @xmath87 satisfies the given conditions .",

    "@xmath0 is uniquely determined .",
    "the following corollary is immediate , by theorem  [ increasing ] .",
    "the same conditions are both necessary and sufficient for @xmath86 to be the rook polynomial of _ any _ ferrers board .",
    "the ascendancy of ferrers boards in the literature can be attributed to various factors .",
    "one is the real frequency with which ferrers board problems crop up in other fields ; another is that more direct combinatorial interpretations ( for example , as partitions ) make their study more tractable .",
    "still another factor is the apparent tendency of new mathematics to accumulate around existing results .",
    "this paper falls primarily into the latter two categories .",
    "the enduring openness of the inverse problem motivated this research , and the combined results of foata - schtzenberger and goldman - joichi - white presented what seems a natural approach to solving it , at least for ferrers boards .",
    "unfortunately , it does not seem that the results obtained in this paper will be readily extensible to more general boards ."
