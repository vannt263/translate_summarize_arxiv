    "an essential prerequisite for quantum information processing  @xcite is the deterministic generation of indistinguishable light pulses of one - photon fock states on demand with well - controlled features , such as efficiency , frequency , polarization , timing etc .. among the various features of single - photon emission , control and manipulation of the spatiotemporal shape of the single - photon light pulses is essential for quantum network applications where symmetric wavepackets are required for a time reversal of the emission process  @xcite or where time - bin entanglement is used  @xcite .",
    "the most prominent way to generate single - photon fock states in high - finesse optical cavities interacting with single emitters is based on vacuum stimulated raman adiabatic approach ( vstirap ) technique  @xcite .",

    "in particular , in atomic systems control of the photon frequency  @xcite , wavepacket length  @xcite and phase  @xcite have been reported .",
    "the efficiency of the generation of single - photon fock states in a scheme based on vstirap technique is governed by an interplay of various system parameters , such as the transition dipole matrix element , intensity and amplitude of the pump pulse , frequency detuning etc .",

    "this behavior is only observed for a certain range of parameters and the efficiency of one - photon fock state generation is very low , which makes it impossible to use the scheme for further applications in quantum communications .",
    "more recently , the possibility of generation of single - photon wave packets with arbitrary shapes in the case when the atom  cavity interaction remains constant during the generation process has been demonstrated both theoretically , on using the master equation formalism for describing the atom  photon system  @xcite , and experimentally , with un - trapped atoms injected into a cavity by means of an atomic fountain  @xcite .    in an earlier work ,",
    "we have studied the potential of a single two - level atom in a high-@xmath1 cavity as a single - photon emitter , where the wave packet associated with the emitted photon is shorter than the cavity decay time  @xcite . within the frame of exact quantum electrodynamics ,",
    "we have particularly shown the feasibility of the generation of single - photon wave packets with time - symmetric spatiotemporal shapes . in the present article",
    "we extend the theory to the interaction of a pumped three - level @xmath0-type emitter with a realistic cavity - assisted quantized electromagnetic field , with the aim of well - defined and controlled one - photon fock - state emission .",
    "in particular , we study in detail both the properties of the excited outgoing wave packet and the efficiency to prepare it in a single - photon fock state .",
