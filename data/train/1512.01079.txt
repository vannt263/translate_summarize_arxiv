    "electrons are the most abundant negatively charged component of cosmic - rays but constitute only about 1% of the total cosmic - ray flux . precise measurements of the energy spectrum of cosmic - ray electrons provide important information for the understanding of the origin and propagation of cosmic rays in the galaxy that is not accessible from the study of the cosmic - ray nuclear components . because of their low mass ,",
    "electrons undergo severe energy loss through synchrotron radiation in the magnetic field and inverse compton scattering with the ambient photons .",
    "there are two prominent origins of high - energy electrons in the cosmic radiation : primary electrons accelerated at sources such as supernova remnants , e.g. @xcite , and secondary electrons produced by processes such as nuclear interactions of cosmic rays with the interstellar matter .",
    "additional sources of electrons such as pulsars , e.g.  @xcite , or dark matter particles , e.g.  @xcite , can not be excluded .",
    "both these additional sources were invoked to explain the measured positron fraction @xcite .",
    "the study of precise measurements of the energy spectrum of cosmic - ray electrons can shed light on their origin and propagation through the galaxy , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "however , the majority of the measurements and the totality of those for energies greater than 100 mev were obtained with experiments in the proximity of the earth , well inside the heliosphere .",
    "therefore , the effects of the solar wind and heliospheric magnetic field can not be neglected .",
    "as cosmic rays traverse the turbulent magnetic field embedded into the solar wind , particles are scattered by its irregularities and undergo convection , diffusion and adiabatic deceleration in the expanding solar wind .",
    "gradient , curvature and current sheet drifts have also an effect that is dominant during periods of minimum solar activity , e.g. see overview @xcite . cosmic rays with rigidities up to tens of gv are affected but the largest effect is seen at low rigidities ( less than a few gv ) , e.g. @xcite .    in august 2012 ,",
    "voyager 1 crossed the heliopause , widely considered to be the modulation boundary and is now inside the very local interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "for the first time , the very local interstellar spectra ( lis ) at low energies , including the electron lis between 5 - 20 mev , have been observed , e.g. @xcite .",
    "together with the pamela measurements at higher energies , these observations make it possible to properly address a major uncertainty in what the total modulation of these cosmic rays is between the modulation boundary and the earth .",
    "furthermore , drift models predict a clear charge - sign dependence for the modulation of cosmic rays @xcite , whose effects are expected to be particularly evident at energies below a few gev . during so - called a @xmath0 0 polarity cycles like solar cycle @xmath1 ,",
    "when the heliospheric magnetic field is directed toward the sun in the northern hemisphere , negatively charged particles drift inward primarily through the polar regions of the heliosphere .",
    "conversely , positively charged particles drift inward primarily through the equatorial regions of the heliosphere , encountering the wavy heliospheric current sheet in the process .",
    "the situation reverses when the solar magnetic field changes its polarity at each solar maximum , causing in the process a clear 22-year cycle in the modulation of cosmic rays .    the most recent period of solar minimum activity and the consequent minimum modulation conditions for cosmic rays were unusual .",
    "it was expected that the new activity cycle would begin early in 2008 .",
    "instead solar minimum modulation conditions continued until the end of 2009 when the largest fluxes of galactic cosmic rays since the beginning of the space age were recorded @xcite .",
    "this period of prolonged solar minimum activity is well suited to study the modulation processes that affect the propagation of galactic cosmic rays inside the heliosphere .",
    "here results on the long - term variation in the energy spectrum of galactic cosmic - ray electrons ( ) measured down to 70 mev are presented .",
    "these results are based on the data set collected by the pamela ( payload for antimatter matter exploration and light - nuclei astrophysics ) satellite - borne experiment  @xcite between july 2006 and december 2009 .",
    "pamela is an instrument designed for cosmic - ray antimatter studies and is flying on - board the russian resurs - dk1 satellite since june 2006 , in a semi - polar near - earth orbit .",
    "results on the effects of the solar modulation on the energy spectra of galactic cosmic - ray protons in the same period have already been published  @xcite , with accompanying numerical modelling by @xcite .",
    "the pamela spectrometer @xcite was designed and built to study the antimatter component of cosmic rays from tens of mev up to hundreds of gev and with a significant increase in statistics with respect to previous experiments . to achieve this goal",
    "the apparatus was optimized for the study of charge one particles and to reach a high level of electron - proton discrimination .",
    "the instrument , shown schematically in figure  [ fig : appa ] , comprises the following subdetectors ( from top to bottom ) : a time - of - flight system ( tof s1 , s2 , s3 ) ; a magnetic spectrometer ; an anticoincidence system ( card , cat , cas ) ; an electromagnetic imaging calorimeter ; a shower tail catcher scintillator ( s4 ) and a neutron detector .",
    "these components are housed inside a pressurized container attached to the russian resurs - dk1 satellite , which was launched on june 15@xmath2 2006 .",
    "the orbital altitude varied between 350  km and 600  km at an inclination of 70@xmath3 .",
    "the central components of pamela are a permanent magnet and a tracking system composed of six planes of double - sided silicon sensors , which form the magnetic spectrometer @xcite .",
    "the main task of the magnetic spectrometer is to measure the particle rigidity r = @xmath4 ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 being the particle momentum and charge , respectively , and @xmath7 the speed of light ) and the ionization energy losses ( de / dx ) .",
    "the rigidity measurement is done through the reconstruction of the trajectory based on the impact points on the tracking planes and the resulting determination of the curvature due to the lorentz force .",
    "the tof system @xcite comprises three double layers of plastic scintillator paddles with the first two ( s1 and s2 ) placed above and the third ( s3 ) immediately below the magnetic spectrometer , as shown in figure  [ fig : appa ] .",
    "the tof system provides the measurements of the particle velocity combining the time of passage information with the track length derived from the magnetic spectrometer . by measuring the particle velocity , direction and",
    "curvature the spectrometer can distinguish between down - going particles and up - going splash - albedo particles and separate negatively from positively charged particles .",
    "the sampling imaging calorimeter ( @xmath8 radiation lengths , @xmath9 interaction lengths ) is used for hadron - lepton separation , using topological and energetic information about the shower development in the calorimeter @xcite . the shower tail catcher and the neutron detector @xcite beneath",
    "provide additional information for the discrimination .",
    "an anticoincidence system is used to reject spurious event @xcite .",
    "the total weight of pamela is 470 kg while the power consumption is 355 w. a more detailed description of the instruments and the data handling can be found in @xcite .",
    "this work is based on data collected between july  2006 and december  2009 .",
    "the periods of time spent by the satellite in the south atlantic anomaly and during significant solar activity ( hence december 2006 , when a large solar event took place @xcite ) were excluded from the data .",
    "data are presented in six - month time periods , a compromise between statistically significant results and detailed analysis of the time variation of the fluxes .",
    "clean events were selected requiring :    1 : :    a single track fitted within the spectrometer fiducial volume where    the reconstructed track is at least 1.5 mm away from the magnet walls . 2 : :    selected tracks must have at least three hits on the bending    @xmath10-view , at least three hits on the non - bending    @xmath11-view and a track lever - arm of at least four silicon    planes in the tracker . 3 : :    a positive value for the velocity @xmath12    ( @xmath13 particle velocity , @xmath7 speed of light )    measured by the tof system .",
    "this set of basic criteria provided events with reliable measurements of the sign and absolute value of the particle rigidity and velocity .    ) as a function of the rigidity .",
    "the various particle species are indicated . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : beta ] shows the distribution of the velocity * ( @xmath14 ) * as function of rigidity for these events .",
    "the spread in the values of @xmath14 for relativistic particles is due to the finite time resolution of the tof system . on the positive side the proton signal dominates , while on the negative side",
    "the electron signal clearly emerges as relativistic particles . however , additional particle species are present in the negatively charged sample .",
    "they are : antiprotons , pions and `` spillover '' protons .",
    "the galactic antiproton component represents a contamination of a few percent over the entire rigidity range .",
    "the pion component is clearly visible below 300  mv in figure  [ fig : beta ] both for positive and negative rigidities .",
    "this component had already been studied for the antiproton analysis @xcite using both simulated and flight data .",
    "the majority of these pion events had hits in the ac scintillators and/or large energy deposits in one of the top tof scintillators clearly indicating that they were the product of cosmic - ray interactions with the pamela structure or pressure vessel .",
    "spillover protons were mostly relativistic events with incorrect determination of the charge sign .",
    "these events included * * : * * high energy protons to which the wrong sign of the curvature was assigned due to the intrinsic deflection uncertainty in spectrometer measurements * * , * * protons that scattered in the material of the tracking system mimicking the trajectory of negatively charged particles and events with spurious hits in the tracker planes causing a wrong reconstruction of the curvature .",
    "the last two effects were the dominant causes for protons reconstructed with low negative rigidities .",
    "this contamination was particularly significant at very low rigidities ( below @xmath15  mv ) where noisy strips could be taken as good points for the fit of a highly bent track when the minimum requirement on the number of hits on the @xmath10-view was just three , as in criterion 2 .",
    "for this reason , a more stringent criterion was used in place of criterion 2 to evaluate the electron fluxes below 500 mv :    2bis : :    selected tracks must have at least four hits on the bending    @xmath10-view , at least three hits on the non - bending    @xmath11-view and a track lever - arm of at least four silicon    planes in the tracker .",
    "then , additional selection criteria were introduced to select as clean as possible sample of electrons :    4 : :    no activity in the card and cat scintillators of the anticoincidence    system below 10 gv , and no activity in the cas scintillators below 300    mv . 5 : :    mean @xmath16  mip ( minimum ionizing particle units ) in    both tof s1 and s2 scintillators . 6",
    ": :    mean ionization energy losses ( de / dx ) in the tracking system planes    less than 1.8 mip 7 : :    relativistic particles : @xmath17 . 8 : :    calorimeter selections",
    ".    criteria 4 - 5 significantly reduced the pion contamination .",
    "the rigidity ranges for the anticounter selection were a compromise between residual pion contamination and electron selection efficiencies .",
    "as the electron energy rises , back - scattering from the electromagnetic shower in the calorimeter increases resulting in an increasing activity in the anticoincidence scintillators .",
    "the different rigidity limit for card and cat respect to cas was due to the different location of the scintillators respect to the calorimeter ( see figure  [ fig : appa ] ) .",
    "criteria 6 - 7 were used to reduce the antiproton and pion contaminations to a negligible amount up to about 1.7 gv and about 250 mv , respectively .",
    "the residual pion and antiproton contaminations at higher rigidities and the spillover proton contamination were removed using the calorimeter information ( criterion 8) .",
    "the calorimeter selection was developed using a monte carlo simulation of the pamela apparatus based on the geant4 code @xcite .",
    "the simulation reproduces the entire pamela apparatus , including the pressure vessel , and was validated using particle beam data .",
    "the longitudinal and transverse segmentation of the calorimeter allowed leptonic showers to be selected with high efficiency and small contamination above 300 mv .",
    "this information was used in previous analysis to successfully select positrons in a vast background of protons @xcite .",
    "the calorimeter electron selection was based on variables that emphasized the differences between the leptonic and hadronic shower like the multiplication with increasing calorimeter depth and the collimation of the electromagnetic cascade along the track .",
    "figure  [ fig : calo ] shows the distribution of one of these variables for the events surviving criteria 1 - 7 .",
    "this quantity , related to the multiplication of the leptonic shower , turned out to have large values for leptons , lower for non interacting and late interacting hadrons because of the limited number of secondaries in the hadronic shower .",
    "the solid lines in figure  [ fig : calo ] indicate the lower limit for electron selection based on this quantity . combining several of these variables all residual contaminations",
    "were reduced to a negligible ( @xmath18 ) amount from 350 mv up to the highest rigidities of this analysis ( see also @xcite ) .    120  mv selected as having a low value in the experimental distribution of figure  [ fig : calo2 ] .",
    "the bending ( x ) and non - bending ( y ) views are shown on the left and on the right , respectively .",
    "a plan view of pamela is shown in the center .",
    "the signal as detected by pamela detectors are shown along with the particle trajectory ( red solid line ) reconstructed by the fitting procedure of the tracking system . ]    at the lowest rigidities ( below 350 mv ) spillover protons accounted for most of the residual contamination after selection with criteria 1 - 7 and were rejected using additional calorimeter variables that exploited the energy deposit in the bottom part of the calorimeter .",
    "electromagnetic showers below about 0.5 gv mostly develop in the first half of the calorimeter , while spillover protons tend to traverse the entire volume .",
    "these features are illustrated in figure  [ fig : calo2 ] that shows the number of strips hit in the last 18 calorimeter planes for events selected with criteria 1 - 7 and rigidity between 70 and 150 mv from simulated ( blue histogram ) and experimental ( red histogram ) data .",
    "the tail to higher values in the red histogram is associated with a contamination of high energy particles traversing most of the calorimeter , with the peak around 35 due to non - interacting particles , while electron - like events account for the part of the distribution at low values as indicated by the consistency with the monte carlo data .",
    "this association is further confirmed by a visual inspection of events from the experimental distribution .    110  mv selected from the peak around 35 in the experimental distribution of figure  [ fig : calo2 ] .",
    "see figure  [ fig : el ] for further details . ]",
    "figures  [ fig : el ] and [ fig : pr ] show two typical events : one with a value of 2 , consistent with an electron signal , and one with a value of 32 , consistent with a contaminating spillover proton . a selection based on this and two related quantities rejected this type of contaminating events without affecting significantly the electron signal .    ) as a function of the rigidity for the events surviving all selection criteria , included criterion 7 : @xmath17 . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : beta2 ] shows the distribution of the velocity as function of rigidity for the events surviving all selection criteria .",
    "the residual contamination of pions , antiprotons and spillover protons was assumed negligible over the entire rigidity range of interest for this work .      as can be seen in figure  [ fig : beta ] ,",
    "the majority of the negatively charged events were electrons .",
    "along with the redundant information provided by the apparatus , this allowed the study of the electron selection efficiencies to be conducted using flight data .",
    "furthermore , the large collected statistics allowed the time dependence of the efficiencies to be monitored over relatively short time scale .",
    "the efficiency study was complemented by an analysis of simulated data . with the monte carlo data it was possible to reproduce and study all selection efficiencies , their rigidity and time dependence allowing also the detection of possible sources of bias in the experimental evaluation of the efficiencies , like contamination of efficiency samples and correlation among selection criteria .        as an example figure  [ fig : effdedx ] shows the efficiencies for the tof de / dx selection ( criterion 5 ) for the first time period ( july - november 2006 ) as a function of rigidity .",
    "the efficiency sample , both experimental and simulated , was selected using all other selection criteria but criterion 5 .",
    "monte carlo data showed that the tof de / dx selection efficiency was unaffected by the selections used to extract the efficiency sample .",
    "the full circles indicate the estimated experimental electron selection efficiency and the open triangles the simulated one . a slight difference ( @xmath19 )",
    "can be seen between the two sets of data , however it should be noted that the shape of the flight data is well reproduced by simulation except at very low rigidities , below about 150 mv . in this rigidity region",
    "the difference between experimental and simulated efficiencies increases to about 5% at 70 mv .",
    "this additional difference was due to a residual contamination in the experimental efficiency sample , as shown by a visual inspection of a random sample of events .",
    "in fact , it was noticed that only a combination of selections based on all pamela detectors was able to produce a clean electron sample at the lowest rigidities .",
    "therefore , the tof de / dx selection efficiency was obtained fitting the flight data ( solid line in figure  [ fig : effdedx ] ) with a functional shape based on the simulated data ( dashed line in figure  [ fig : effdedx ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : effdedx2 ] shows the resulting efficiency for criterion 5 at the beginning and at the end of the data taking .",
    "a small time dependence ( about 2% in nearly four years ) of the efficiency can be noticed .",
    "similarly to the case of the analysis of the proton flux @xcite , the efficiency of the tracking system selection ( criteria 1 and 2 ) and , especially , its energy dependence was obtained by monte carlo data .",
    "the tracking system selection efficiency was found to decrease over the years from a maximum of @xmath20 in 2006 to @xmath21 at the end of 2009 when criterion 2 was used in the selection , with criterion 2bis the decrease in the efficiency was sharper , down to @xmath22 at the end of 2009 .",
    "this significant time dependence was due to the sudden , random failure of a few front - end chips in the tracking system .",
    "this resulted in a progressive reduction of the tracking efficiency , since the number of hits available for track reconstruction decreased .",
    "however , no degradation in the signal - to - noise ratio and spatial resolution was observed .",
    "the front - end chips failure was treated in the simulation with the inclusion of a time - dependent map of dead channels .",
    "another exception was the anticounter selection ( criterion 4 ) efficiency for which the simulated values were used .",
    "while there was an excellent agreement between the experimental and simulated efficiencies , the monte carlo predicted a dependence of the efficiency on the shape of the electron energy spectrum when measured as a function of rigidity in the spectrometer instead of energy at top of the payload . considering that the electron spectral shape varied significantly over the orbit due to the earth s magnetic field ( see section  [ s : cutoff ] ) ,",
    "it was decided to correct with the simulated efficiency the selected events distributed according to their energies reconstructed at the top of the payload , i.e. the unfolded count distribution , see next section .",
    "gv ) before ( open circles ) and after ( full circles ) the unfolding procedure .",
    "bottom panel : ratio between the unfolded and folded count distributions . ]",
    "since in this analysis the electron energies were obtained by measuring the deflections , hence the rigidities , of the particles in the magnet cavity , both the response of the spectrometer and the energy losses suffered by the electrons prior entering the tracking system had to be properly accounted for .",
    "particularly significant were energy losses due to bremsstrahlung of electrons while traversing the pressurized container and parts of the apparatus on top of the tracking system ( equivalent to about 0.1 radiation lengths ) , since the resulting photons were able to traverse the spectrometer without being detected .",
    "consequently the measured rigidities differed from the initial energies of the electrons at the top of the payload . to account for these effects a bayesian unfolding procedure , as described in  @xcite , was applied to the count distributions of selected events binned according to their measured rigidities and divided by all selection efficiencies except those of the tracking system and anticounter selections .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , these were , instead , applied to the unfolded count distribution .",
    "figure  [ fig : unfold ] , top panel , shows the count distribution for the lowest geomagnetic cutoff interval ( @xmath23  gv ) before ( open circles ) and after ( full circles ) the unfolding procedure .",
    "the bottom panel shows the variation of counts in each rigidity ( in the spectrometer)/energy ( at the top of the payload ) bin resulting from the unfolding procedure .",
    "the fluxes @xmath24 ( e kinetic energy ) were evaluated as follows :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the unfolded count distribution , @xmath27 the efficiencies of the remaining tracking system and anticounter selections , @xmath28 the geometrical factor , @xmath29 the live - time and @xmath30 the width of the energy interval .    the geometrical factor , i.e. the requirement of triggering and containment , at least 1.5  mm away from the magnet walls and the tof - scintillator edges , was estimated with the full simulation of the apparatus .",
    "hence , it accounted for the geometry of the instrument , the magnetic field and all physical processes such as energy losses , multiple scattering , etc .. it was found to be constant at 19.9 @xmath31  sr above 1 gev , decreasing smoothly to 8 @xmath31  sr at 70 mev .",
    "this decrease was due to the curvature of electrons in the magnetic spectrometer .",
    "the pamela instrumental limit for electrons is @xmath32  mev , below which the particle trajectory hits the magnet walls .    ) intervals specified in the figure .",
    "the arrows indicate the energy regions where the galactic electrons dominate and are unaffected by the earth s magnetosphere . around the geomagnetic cutoff , in the penumbral region , galactic electrons are mixed with re - entrant albedo electrons that become the dominant component as the energies decrease . ]    the live time was provided by an on - board clock that timed the periods during which the apparatus was waiting for a trigger .",
    "the accuracy of the live time determination was cross - checked by comparing different clocks available in flight , which showed a relative difference of less than 0.2% .",
    "the total live time was about 5@xmath33s above @xmath34 20  gv , reducing to about 4@xmath35 of this value at 70  mv , because of the relatively short time spent by the satellite at high geomagnetic latitudes .",
    "because of the wide geomagnetic region spanned by the satellite over its orbit , the electron energy spectrum was evaluated for various , sixteen , vertical geomagnetic cutoff intervals , estimated using the satellite position and the strmer approximation .",
    "figure  [ fig : cutoff ] shows the   spectrum measured in five different geomagnetic regions .",
    "two electron components can be clearly seen : at energies higher than the corresponding geomagnetic cutoff the galactic component and at lower energies the re - entrant albedo one , with a transition region where the two components mix .",
    "the arrows in figure  [ fig : cutoff ] indicate the energy region ( 1.3 times above the maximum vertical geomagnetic cutoff of each interval , i.e. @xmath36  gev for the black full circle fluxes and so on ) where the fluxes were assumed to be of galactic origin and unaffected by the earth s magnetosphere .",
    "then , the final electron spectrum was determined by combining the fluxes of each geomagnetic cutoff interval weighted for its fractional live time .",
    "possible time - dependent variations of the electron fluxes , due to , e.g. , not fully estimated time variations of the tracking selection efficiencies , were studied as in the proton analysis @xcite .",
    "the high - energy ( 30 - 50 gev ) proton flux was measured for each half year and with the same selections as in this analysis but the calorimeter selection .",
    "the tracking selection efficiencies were estimated with the same monte carlo code used for this analysis .",
    "then , the resulting fluxes measured in july - november 2006 were divided by the proton fluxes measured in the other time intervals .",
    "figure  [ fig : protflux ] shows this ratio as a function of time for fluxes obtained with criterion 2bis ( a ) and with criterion 2 ( b ) . as it can be seen the high - energy proton flux varies of maximum 2% over the years with the exception of the end of 2009 when the flux estimated with criterion 2 differs of about 4% .",
    "these ratios were used to normalize the electron fluxes measured using both criterion 2 and 2 bis in each half - year time interval . + in conclusion , the final energy spectra were obtained by correcting the fluxes with these normalization factors and using , as explained in section  [ s : sel ] ( see also section [ s : sys ] ) * , * criterion 2bis up to 500 mev and the significantly more efficient criterion 2 at higher energies .",
    "selection efficiencies were obtained by flight and simulated data using efficiency samples .",
    "the statistical errors resulting from the finite size of such samples were included in the uncertainties of the flux measurements and treated as systematic uncertainties . in case of efficiencies that deviated from the fitted values beyond statistical fluctuations ( e.g. see figure  [ fig : effdedx ] ) , the deviations were observed to follow a gaussian distribution and the rms of such distribution was treated as one standard deviation systematic error @xcite .",
    "the fluxes were normalized using factors obtained comparing the high - energy proton flux over time .",
    "the errors on these factors amounted to less than 1% and were treated as systematic uncertainties .",
    "this normalization accounted for the stability respect to the second half of 2006 of the fluxes estimated for the following time periods .",
    "a possible systematic uncertainty on the high - energy proton flux obtained for july - november 2006 and due to the tracking selection efficiency was studied as in @xcite .",
    "an efficiency sample was obtained both from flight and simulated data selecting non - interacting minimum ionizing particles traversing the calorimeter .",
    "this requirement selected protons with rigidities @xmath37 gv and larger .",
    "the resulting simulated and experimental tracking selection efficiency differed of 1.7% and 2.3% when using criterion 2 and 2bis , respectively . considering that this experimental efficiency sample was not fully representative of the experimental condition for this analysis ,",
    "this difference was treated as one standard deviation systematic error .    as a check of the consistency of the evaluation of the selection efficiencies the energy spectrum of each time interval obtained with criterion 2",
    "was compared with the equivalent one obtained with criterion 2bis .",
    "figure  [ fig:334comp434 ] shows the ratios of the two sets of fluxes for each time interval .",
    "the solid lines indicate the systematic uncertainties associated with the efficiencies . above 500 mev ,",
    "the two sets of fluxes agree perfectly within the systematic uncertainties showing that systematic errors were properly assigned to the selection efficiencies .",
    "below 500 mev , the fluxes obtained with criterion 2 are consistently higher because of the contamination by spillover protons caused by the less stringent selection , as discussed in section  [ s : sel ] .",
    "an additional check was performed to validate the estimation of the low energy ( @xmath38 gev ) fluxes .",
    "the low energy part of the re - entrant albedo spectrum was measured at the lowest geomagnetic latitude ( vertical geomagnetic cutoff greater than 12.1 gv ) in each time interval and it was compared to the same spectrum measured in the second half of 2006 .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that , because of the east - west effect , re - entrant albedo at low geomagnetic latitudes , i.e. high geomagnetic cutoffs , are mostly produced by high - energy ( @xmath39 gev ) protons interacting with the earth s atmosphere .",
    "therefore , it can be inferred that the re - entrant albedo energy spectrum should not show significant temporal variations due to solar modulation , and hence it can be used to check the temporal stability of the flux measurements at the lowest energies .",
    "figure  [ fig : albedo ] shows the re - entrant albedo fluxes measured in july - november 2006 divided by the equivalent fluxes measured in the other time intervals .",
    "the solid lines indicate the systematic uncertainties associated with these data .",
    "no significant time variation was found , indicating that the systematic uncertainties properly accounted for any residual time dependence down to the lowest measured energies .",
    "the unfolding procedure was a significant correction for the electron spectra , therefore the corresponding uncertainties were carefully studied .",
    "it was shown in the proton analysis @xcite that this procedure was able to account for the intrinsic spatial resolution and the alignment uncertainty of the spectrometer silicon sensors .",
    "the related uncertainties , as well as the additional effects due to the significant energy losses and reduced statistical significance of the count distribution , were studied by folding and unfolding a known spectral shape .",
    "a large sample of electrons was simulated with an input spectrum consistent with the reconstructed experimental spectrum at the top of the payload for the lowest geomagnetic cutoff rigidity interval .",
    "then , the rigidities of the simulated events were reconstructed and one hundred different count distributions were built as in the analysis .",
    "the statistics of each count distribution was comparable with the experimental statistics for a geomagnetic cutoff interval .",
    "then , the count distributions were unfolded and compared with the large simulated sample by means of pull distributions  @xcite .",
    "these pull distributions followed the expected standard normal distribution with sigma consistent with one , hence the statistical errors properly accounted for the fluctuations in the flux values , and means that fluctuated around zero .",
    "the relative differences between the means of the expected and reconstructed count distributions could be approximated with a gaussian distribution . following @xcite , the rms of this distribution , amounting to 4% , was treated as one standard deviation systematic error due to the unfolding procedure . + the unfolding procedure was also tested comparing the resulting electron energy spectrum with the one obtained estimating the electron energy from the total energy deposited in the calorimeter ( for more information see  @xcite ) .",
    "a difference of 2% at 2 gev increasing to 6% at 10 gev and then decreasing to less than 1% above 30 gev was found between the two approaches .",
    "this difference is consistent with the previously estimated unfolding uncertainty .",
    "hence , even if it may also account for additional uncertainties such as those on thickness and density of the materials above the tracking system , it was not added to the uncertainty of the unfolding procedure .",
    "finally , the full analysis chain was cross - checked with simulations .",
    "electron events were simulated at the top of the payload with isotropic arrival directions and with energy spectrum from 40 mev to 100 gev consistent with the reconstructed experimental spectrum for the first geomagnetic cutoff interval ( 0 - 0.055  gv ) .",
    "then , the events that , according to simulation , triggered the instrument were processed with the pamela data analysis software and consequently treated as in the experimental analysis ( rigidity determination , selection based on criteria 1 - 8 , efficiency and unfolding corrections , flux determination ) .",
    "the resulting energy spectrum was compared with the input one and a good agreement was found .",
    "the differences between the input and reconstructed fluxes at top of the payload were consistent with the uncertainties related to the unfolding procedure described in the previous paragraphs .",
    "therefore , it was concluded that the analysis procedure did not introduce additional uncertainties .",
    "figure  [ fig : sys ] shows the relative errors resulting from the quadratic sum of the systematic uncertainties discussed here .",
    "evidently , the uncertainty is higher at low rigidities , where the criterion 2bis is used , and it increases over time , essentially because of the decreasing efficiency of the tracking system .",
    "figures  [ fig : flux1 ] and [ fig : flux2 ] and tables  [ tab : flux1 ] and [ tab : flux2 ] show the resulting electron ( ) energy spectra for the seven half - year periods .",
    "the error bars are the quadratic sum of the statistical and systematic errors .",
    "the electron spectra for each time interval are overlaid with the corresponding computed spectra ( solid lines ) with respect to the local interstellar spectrum ( lis , dashed lines ) , which is based on voyager 1 observations @xcite at low energies .",
    "this lis was described by @xcite ; see also the review by @xcite .",
    "the full three - dimensional numerical model was described in detail by @xcite .",
    "it is based on the numerical solution of parker s transport equation @xcite , including all four major modulation mechanisms : convection , diffusion described by a full 3d tensor , particle drifts caused by gradients , curvatures and the current sheet in the heliospheric magnetic field ( hmf ) , and adiabatic energy changes .",
    "averaging these fluxes over the whole time period ( july 2006-december 2009 ) , the resulting absolute energy spectrum was compared to the previously published results @xcite .",
    "this new estimation yields fluxes whose absolute values are approximately 10% higher than in the previous work .",
    "this difference stems from an improved treatment both in the data and in the simulation of the time dependence of the tracking system performances and unfolding procedure .",
    "figure  [ fig : ratflux ] shows the ratios as a function of energy between the measured half - year period fluxes from january 2007 until december 2009 and the fluxes measured in the first period of data taking ( july - november 2006 ) .",
    "it follows from these ratios that the low - energy electron flux increased by a factor of about 1.6 from 2006 to 2009 at about 0.5 gev .",
    "protons at corresponding rigidities , on the other hand , increased by a factor of about 2.4 over this period @xcite , indicating the effect of particle drifts .",
    "furthermore , the comparison between the model simulations and observations shows that the electron spectrum became progressively softer , more than expected from drift model predictions .",
    "this requires larger diffusion coefficients at lower energies ( kinetic energy @xmath0 200 mev ) than anticipated .",
    "details concerning the electron modulation model with theoretical assumptions and implications will be published in an accompanying paper @xcite .",
    "we have presented new results on the electron ( ) energy spectrum between 70 mev and 50 gev obtained by the pamela experiment during the past extraordinary solar minimum period that ended in late 2009 - beginning of 2010 . by comparing the observations with the model as described in an accompanying paper @xcite valuable insight",
    "is gained in what caused electron modulation over this unusual solar minimum period .",
