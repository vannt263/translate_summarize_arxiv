    "the recent three year results from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) satellite @xcite have further confirmed with an extraordinary precision the inflationary paradigm of structure formation in which primordial fluctuations are created from quantum fluctuations during an early period of superluminal expansion of the universe @xcite .    indeed , soon after the wmap data release , a number of authors investigated the possibility to discriminate between several single - field inflationary models using this new , high quality , dataset @xcite .",
    "one of the main conclusions of these works is that some inflationary models , such as quartic chaotic models of the form @xmath0 , may be considered ruled out by the current data , while others , such as chaotic inflation with a quadratic potential @xmath1 , are consistent with all data sets .",
    "one important assumption in these analyses ( apart for @xcite ) is that the inflaton s potential is featureless , i.e. , there is no preferred scale during inflation and the primordial power spectrum of density perturbations in fourier @xmath2-space can be well approximated by a power law @xmath3 , where the spectral index @xmath4 is almost scale independent .",
    "the main prediction of these models is that the anisotropy angular power spectrum should be `` smooth '' and not show features in addition to those provided by the baryon - photon plasma oscillations at decoupling within the framework of the standard @xmath5cdm model of structure formation .",
    "the current wmap data is in very good agreement with this hypothesis : several non - standard features in the anisotropy angular power spectrum detected in the first year data have now disappeared thanks to the longer integration time of the observations and better control of systematics ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , features in the large scale anisotropy spectrum are still present in the new release . moreover , some of the cosmological parameters derived from the new wmap data , like , for instance , the low value of the variance of fluctuations @xmath6 , appear in tension with those derived by complementary data sets .",
    "it is therefore timely to investigate a larger set of inflationary models and to consider a cosmological origin of these unexpected features .",
    "a departure from power law behavior of the primordial power spectrum could be caused by a change of the initial conditions , due to trans - planckian physics @xcite or unusual initial field dynamics @xcite or by some brief violation of the slow roll conditions during inflation  @xcite .",
    "we will investigate a model of the second type where features in the temperature and density power spectra arise due to a step - like change in the potential parameters , as proposed by  @xcite . a sharp step in the inflaton mass , caused ,",
    "e.g. , by a symmetry breaking phase transition , generates indeed @xmath2-dependent oscillations in the spectrum of primordial density perturbations .",
    "the goal of our paper is to make use of the recent three year wmap data ( wmap3 ) and other datasets to constrain the possibility of a step feature in the inflaton potential . for this purpose",
    "we adopt the phenomenological model proposed by adams et al .",
    "@xcite , where a step feature is added to the chaotic inflationary potential in the following way : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is an overall normalization factor , @xmath9 determines the height of the step , @xmath10 its gradient and @xmath11 is the field value on which the step is centered .",
    "previous phenomenological studies of the same  @xcite or other oscillatory features  @xcite have been limited to the first year wmap data , and in general a full analysis varying also all cosmological parameters is still missing and is the major result of this work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we briefly review step - inflation models . in sec .",
    "iii we describe our analysis method . in sec .",
    "iv we present our results and , finally , in sec .",
    "v we derive our conclusions .",
    "inflationary models with a step can naturally arise in theories with many interacting scalar fields , e.g. , in supergravity models .",
    "in general , these models contain several flat directions in field space and thus offer the possibility to have multiple inflationary phases separated by phase transitions @xcite , or even inflation with a _ curved _ trajectory in field space @xcite . in the last case",
    "the presence of additional _ active _ scalar degrees of freedom generates not only the adiabatic mode of curvature perturbations , but also the isocurvature one .",
    "since the data do not seem to require an isocurvature component  @xcite , we will restrict ourselves to the case where the phase transition does not appreciably change the rolling direction corresponding to the inflaton field and the energy density is always dominated by a single field .",
    "also , we will investigate the simplest scenario and assume that the sole effect of the phase transition is to change the parameters of the lagrangian for the inflaton field , in particular its mass .",
    "consider a hybrid inflationary potential of the type @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the inflaton field , while @xmath14 is a hybrid field that takes a vacuum expectation value during inflation when the inflaton reaches the critical value @xmath15 . in the usual case of hybrid inflation ,",
    "this transition is so strong that it stops the inflationary phase .",
    "but , if the coupling @xmath16 is sufficiently small , the back - reaction of @xmath14 is too weak and inflation continues . on the other hand ,",
    "the parameters of the lagrangian change their value and for example the inflaton effective mass becomes @xmath17 in this scenario , even if the classical inflaton is nearly unperturbed , the inflaton perturbations are affected and the primordial power spectrum is modified . + it is well known that a step in the mass generates oscillations in the primordial spectrum and this can be described analytically in the wkb approximation @xcite .",
    "the behavior of the inflaton mass is determined by the dynamics of the phase transition and the growth of the hybrid field fluctuations , which become tachyonic after the critical point .",
    "this growth depends on the classical inflaton field motion , but is in general so fast that @xmath14 reaches the minimum in a very small number of @xmath18-foldings @xcite .",
    "the inflaton mass is therefore reasonably well approximated by a hyperbolic tangent , and so we take @xmath19 here , we see that the parameter @xmath8 is an average inflaton mass and @xmath11 is of the order of the critical value @xmath20 .",
    "the other two parameters determine the duration of the transition and the strength of the effect on the inflaton s mass .",
    "note that we work in planck units , so all dimensional quantities like @xmath11 and @xmath10 should be multiplied by @xmath21 in order to obtain their value in physical units . in this article",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case of chaotic inflation , where the mass term determines both the classical dynamics of the inflaton and the behavior of the perturbations",
    ". a more general discussion will be left for a longer publication @xcite .",
    "we therefore assume that @xmath22 and also its change due to the phase transition are completely negligible .",
    "we also discuss here only positive @xmath9 values ; negative @xmath9 is also allowed , but is restricted to be very small to avoid the presence of another minimum in the potential away from @xmath23 .",
    "since we can not rely on the slow roll approximation for a generic choice of parameters , we integrate the equations for the background and for the modes numerically as discussed in detail in  @xcite .",
    "the equations for the inflaton field and the hubble parameter in planck units are simply @xmath24 we assume slow roll as the initial condition for @xmath25 and solve the evolution numerically until the end of inflation in order to determine the number of @xmath18-foldings between @xmath11 and the end of inflation .",
    "the equation for the fourier components of @xmath26 , the curvature perturbation @xcite , takes the usual form @xmath27 where @xmath28 is given by the background dynamics and the primes and dots denote derivatives with respect to conformal time and physical time , respectively . using the equations of motion for the classical field",
    ", we have in general @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the derivatives of the potential with respect to the inflaton field . in the step model",
    ", this quantity can deviate substantially from the slow - roll expectation at the time of the transition .",
    "we solve equations numerically using a bulirsch - stoer algorithm for free field initial conditions at an initial time when is satisfied .",
    "once we know the solution for the mode @xmath2 , we can determine the primordial power spectrum @xmath32 evaluated when the mode is well outside the horizon .",
    "our results are stable with respect to changes in the exact time when we set the initial conditions and when we compute the spectrum .",
    "the resulting spectra as a function of @xmath2 for different parameters are shown in figure  [ jan1 ] .",
    "essentially , the spectrum shows a power - law behavior with a superimposed oscillation .",
    "how will the four parameters of our model affect the shape of the spectrum ?",
    "the overall normalization of @xmath33 is proportional to @xmath34 , @xmath11 determines the wavelength at which the feature appears and the maximum amplitude of the oscillations is roughly proportional to @xmath9 .",
    "generally , the dominant contribution to @xmath35 comes from the @xmath31 term and is proportional to @xmath36 , so the range of @xmath2 affected by the feature depends on the square root of @xmath36 .",
    "note that away from the step , the slow roll conditions are satisfied and the spectrum recovers the usual power law form with spectral index given by @xmath37 for a number of @xmath18-foldings @xmath38 equal to 50 , which is what we assume for our analysis .",
    "the value of the spectral index is the same before and after the step since it does not depend on @xmath34 in @xmath39 models .",
    "also , for values of the parameters where the slow - roll conditions are always satisfied ( i.e. , small values of @xmath36 ) , the spectrum does not show a full oscillation , but a dip at the scales corresponding to the transition .",
    "so even in this case it is not so well approximated by the usual power - law with a constant spectral index .",
    "we compare the theoretical model described in the previous sections with a set of current cosmological data by making use of a modified version of the publicly available markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) package ` cosmomc `  @xcite .",
    "we sample an eight - dimensional set of parameters .",
    "four of them determine the primordial power spectrum , namely the @xmath40 and @xmath10 parameters of the step - inflation model as described in the previous section and the overall normalization of the primordial power spectrum @xmath41 ( equivalent to @xmath34 as discussed earlier ) .",
    "the remaining four cosmological parameters are the physical baryon and cdm densities , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , the ratio of the sound horizon to the angular diameter distance at decoupling , @xmath44 and finally , the optical depth to reionization , @xmath45 .",
    "furthermore , we consider purely adiabatic initial conditions , impose flatness and neglect neutrino masses .",
    "we include the three year data @xcite ( temperature and polarization ) using the likelihood routine for supplied by the wmap team and available at the ` lambda ` web site .",
    "we marginalize over the amplitude of the sunyaev - zeldovich signal .",
    "the mcmc convergence diagnostics are done on four chains using the gelman and rubin `` variance of chain means''@xmath46``mean of chain variances '' @xmath47 statistics for each parameter , demanding that @xmath48 .",
    "our @xmath49 constraints are obtained after marginalization over the remaining `` nuisance '' parameters , again using the programs included in the ` cosmomc ` package .",
    "in addition to cmb data , we also consider the constraints on the real - space power spectrum of galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite .",
    "we restrict the analysis to a range of scales over which the fluctuations are assumed to be in the linear regime ( @xmath50 ) . when combining the matter power spectrum with cmb data , we marginalize over an additional nuisance parameter @xmath51 , the dark versus luminous matter bias .",
    "furthermore , we make use of the hst key project measurement of the hubble parameter @xmath52 @xcite by multiplying the likelihood by a gaussian centered around @xmath53 with a standard deviation @xmath54 .",
    "finally , we impose a top - hat prior on the age of the universe , @xmath55 gyrs , and a gaussian prior on @xmath56 centered around @xmath57 with a standard deviation of @xmath58 from bbn constraints , cf .  ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we demand that the feature appear at a wavelength to which our data is sensitive , so our analysis will be limited to the interval . apart from that we also impose logarithmic priors on the other step parameters : , and and flat priors on the cosmological parameters .    as it turns out",
    ", the likelihood distribution @xmath59 has a rather odd shape and some of the interesting features are at low likelihoods . in order to improve mixing and get a better coverage of the low likelihood regions , we sample @xmath60 instead of @xmath59 ( i.e. , we use `` heated '' chains at @xmath61 ) .    as a measure of the performance of the step model ,",
    "we compare its best fit @xmath62 with the best fit @xmath62 of a reference model , which we take to be the `` vanilla '' 6 parameter ( @xmath56 , @xmath63 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath41 and @xmath64 ) power law @xmath5cdm model .",
    "marginalised likelihood ( solid line ) and projection of the likelihood distribution ( dotted line ) for the @xmath11 parameter in the case of wmap only .",
    "two peaks for @xmath11 at @xmath65 and @xmath66 are clearly visible .",
    "the one at @xmath66 provides a good fit to the low @xmath67 wmap glitches .",
    "it is evident that the likelihood function is far from gaussian in this direction .",
    "the difference between the two curves is caused by a volume effect when integrating over the other parameter directions . ]",
    "let us first consider the wmap dataset alone . in figure [ likelihoodwmaponly ] we plot the mean likelihood for the @xmath11 parameter which determines the position ( scale ) of the step in the potential .",
    "if some value of @xmath11 is preferred by the data , then it would hint at the presence of a feature .",
    "as we can see , the mean likelihood distribution clearly indicates two maxima for the @xmath11 parameter at @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "the feature at @xmath66 is able to produce a good fit to the wmap low-@xmath67 glitches ( yielding an improvement of @xmath68 over the vanilla model ) and agrees with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite for fixed cosmological parameters and wmap first year data .",
    "interestingly , the authors of @xcite find an oscillating feature at roughly the same scale by reconstructing the primordial power spectrum from the first year data .",
    "the minimum at @xmath65 provides oscillations on smaller scales ( @xmath69 ) , beyond the second peak in the anisotropy power spectrum , see figure  [ wmapcltt ] .",
    "it is interesting to project the likelihood function onto the @xmath70 plane ( figure [ contour ] , upper panel ) .",
    "first of all , we see that for a range of values ( @xmath71 ) a region of step models with @xmath72 @xmath73 is ruled out at @xmath74 confidence level .",
    "this disfavored region corresponds to the region in @xmath2 space that is better sampled by the wmap data , and where , therefore , the data provide the strongest constraints .",
    "secondly , the two aforementioned maxima in @xmath11-space can again be seen in the @xmath49 projection .",
    "these maxima are close to the two boundaries ( large and small scales ) of the region sampled by wmap and centered around amplitude @xmath75 .",
    "we find that the wmap polarization and cross temperature - polarization data are rather insensitive to the presence of features",
    ".     mean likelihood and marginalized likelihood contours in the ( @xmath76 ) and @xmath77 planes at @xmath78 and @xmath74 c.l .  for wmap data only .",
    "the peaks comprise less than ten per cent of the total volume of the likelihood function.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]   mean likelihood and marginalized likelihood contours in the ( @xmath76 ) and @xmath77 planes at @xmath78 and @xmath74 c.l .  for wmap data only .",
    "the peaks comprise less than ten per cent of the total volume of the likelihood function.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the @xmath10 parameter is not well constrained by the data due to a degeneracy with @xmath9 .",
    "instead , we consider the constraints in the ( @xmath79 ) parameter space ( figure [ contour ] , bottom panel ) .",
    "this parameter is as well constrained as @xmath9 and , again , the presence of two maxima for @xmath11 is evident .",
    "also , the maxima are at values of @xmath36 of order @xmath80 , where the slow - roll conditions are strongly violated ; values of @xmath81 correspond , on the other hand , to the usual slow - roll @xmath39 inflation and can not be excluded by the data .    note that in the ( @xmath82)-subspace of parameter space the likelihood function is very oddly shaped and can by no means be approximated by a multivariate gaussian . as a consequence ,",
    "the likelihood at the boundaries of this subspace is generally not negligible ( see , e.g. , figure [ likelihoodwmaponly ] ) .",
    "in fact , the likelihood function will have a large plateau of constant likelihood in regions where the step model can not be distinguished from the @xmath39 chaotic inflation model , either because the step is too small or too smooth ( small @xmath9 , large @xmath10 ) or because the feature appears at wavelengths the data is not sensitive to ( @xmath11 too small or too large ) .",
    "apart from the two peaks , we also find a valley that can be excluded at a high confidence level .",
    "however , since the plateau may contain a significant fraction of the total volume of the likelihood distribution , constraints derived from marginalization will be dependent on the priors on @xmath11 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "likelihood contours in the @xmath83 and @xmath77 planes at @xmath84 and @xmath74 confidence level for cmb+sdss.,title=\"fig : \" ]   likelihood contours in the @xmath83 and @xmath77 planes at @xmath84 and @xmath74 confidence level for cmb+sdss.,title=\"fig : \" ]    for our choice of priors and wmap data only , we find that the peak regions contribute about @xmath78 of the total volume , so , from a bayesian standpoint , the wmap data alone do not require the presence of a feature .",
    "figure [ wmapcltt ] indicates that the best fit model has a feature at a range of wavelengths where the wmap data are limited by large systematic errors .",
    "it is therefore interesting to enquire whether the inclusion of other data sets which are more sensitive at small scales will corroborate this result . to this end",
    "we add small scale cmb data from the acbar , boomerang , cbi , maxima and vsa experiments @xcite and the sdss large scale structure data .",
    "these data sets probe mainly smaller scales and are not sensitive to the large scale feature at @xmath66 .",
    "we find that including these small scale data improves the constraints on the oscillations quite significantly : @xmath85 , to which the sdss data alone contribute about 6 . as we can see from figure [ wmap+all ] ( bottom panel )",
    ", step - induced oscillations in the matter power spectrum seem to provide a much better fit to the sdss data .",

    "adding the sdss data increases the statistical significance of the maximum , the peak near ( @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 ) now contains about @xmath90 of the total volume of the likelihood function , the likelihood at the boundaries of parameter space is suppressed and hence , the results are much less prior dependent . also , we can rule out a much larger chunk of parameter space for @xmath91 due to the increased sensitivity of the data on the corresponding scales .",
    "the variance test convergence stats using last half chains are @xmath92 for @xmath11 , @xmath93 for @xmath72 and @xmath94 for @xmath95 , showing a robust convergence of the chains .",
    "we also considered data from the 2df galaxy redshift survey @xcite and we found that the cmb+sdss results are stable under the inclusion of the 2df dataset .",
    "of course , oscillatory behavior in the observed data could well have its origin in uncorrected or unidentified systematic effects such as a scale dependent bias .",
    "however , as indicated by our results , the presence of multiple step - like features in the inflaton potential ( expected from , e.g. , supergravity or m - theory models @xcite ) is also a viable solution .",
    "it is important to check if the step in the potential suggested by the cmb+sdss analysis has some impact on the estimation of the remaining cosmological parameters .",
    "we find no correlations between @xmath96 and the cosmological parameters @xmath97 and @xmath45 .",
    "this is clearly due to the fixed spectral index the model has away from the feature .    on the other hand",
    "some correlation is present between @xmath9 and the baryon and cold dark matter energy densities @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "figure [ ccorr ] shows the confidence level likelihood contours in the @xmath100 and @xmath101 parameter space . a deeper step in the potential ( larger @xmath9 ) has the effect of making the data more compatible with a lower baryon density and a higher cold dark matter density . while the effect is small , it is interesting to note that the baryon density derived from the wmap data in the framework of the standard model is generally larger than that predicted by standard big bang nucleosynthesis and measurements of the primordial deuterium abundance ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "correlations between @xmath9 and the cosmological parameters @xmath56 and @xmath63 for cmb+sdss . plotted are the @xmath102 , @xmath84 and @xmath74 confidence levels .",
    "the best fit step model peak prefers a slighly lower value of @xmath103 than the plateau region where the feature is insignificant .",
    "one can also see that near the best fit region , the larger @xmath9 the smaller the corresponding value of @xmath56 . ]",
    "recently , a detection of oscillations in the correlation function of the luminous red galaxies sample of the sdss has been reported in @xcite .",
    "if those oscillations are the imprint of primordial acoustic oscillations in the primeval baryon+photon plasma , then they may provide a standard ruler at the redshift of the survey and a very powerful tool for testing the late time evolution of the universe and , ultimately , the appearance of dark energy .",
    "clearly , if oscillations in the primordial spectrum are present they may mimic baryonic oscillations @xcite at different scales and drastically change the estimation of cosmological parameters .    as a qualitative example , we plot in figure [ bao ] the correlation functions for a model with no baryons , the standard @xmath5cdm model ( @xmath104 ) and a model with no baryons but with a step in the inflationary potential .",
    "as we can see , a model with no baryons but with oscillations in the primordial spectra can reproduce the observed data very well .",
    "a more detailed and quantitative analysis will be presented in a future paper @xcite .",
    "correlation functions for a model with no baryons , the standard @xmath5cdm model ( @xmath104 ) and a model with no baryons but with a step in the inflationary potential .",
    "the data points are from the lrgs sample of @xcite . ]",
    "the new three year wmap data seem to confirm the presence of non - standard large scale features on the cosmic microwave anisotropy power spectrum .",
    "while these features may hint at uncorrected experimental systematics , a possible cosmological way to generate large angular scale oscillations is to introduce a sharp step in the inflaton potential . by making use of current cosmological data we derive constraints on the position , magnitude and gradient of a possible step in the inflaton potential .",
    "our conclusion is that such a step , while strongly constrained by current data , is still allowed and may provide an interesting explanation to the current measured deviations from the standard featureless spectrum at low @xmath67 .",
    "surprisingly though , the combination of all cmb data sets with the sdss data seems to prefer a feature at small scales , which could mimic the effect of baryonic oscillations and reduces the best fit value of @xmath105 . note that for this it is sufficient to have a minute change , of order @xmath106 , in the inflaton mass parameter , but a relatively fast one .",
    "it is an open question if such a sharp step can be realized in realistic inflationary models and if the effect is physical . in general",
    "we can exclude the presence of strong features with @xmath107 in the observable range .",
