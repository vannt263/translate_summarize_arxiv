    "in numerous modern applications ( geography @xcite , biomedical imagery ( see  @xcite for example ) , geophysics @xcite , art investigation @xcite ,  ) , the data available for analysis consist of images of homogeneous textures , that need to be characterized . for such images ,",
    "a key issue consists first in describing , within a suitable framework , the anisotropy of the texture , and then in defining regularity anisotropy parameters that can actually and efficiently be measured via numerical procedures and further involved into e.g. , classification schemes .",
    "furthermore , in many cases the analyzed textures display at the same time self  similarity and anisotropy properties .",
    "this is for example such the case in medical imaging ( osteoporosis , muscular tissues , mammographies , ... ) , cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite , hydrology  @xcite , fracture surfaces analysis  @xcite,  .    in  @xcite , we proposed a method for studying jointly selfsimilarity and anisotropy in images by focusing on a specific classic class of gaussian anisotropic selfsimilar processes .",
    "we consider @xmath0 norms of hyperbolic wavelets coefficients which permits the use of different dilation factors along the horizontal and vertical axis .",
    "we prove empirically that these @xmath0 norms are maximal for a specific ratio of the horizontal and vertical axis , directly related to the anisotropy of the model .    in  @xcite",
    ", we proved that there is a close relationship between @xmath0 norms of the hyperbolic wavelet coefficients of a function and its norm in a convenient class of anisotropic functional spaces : the anisotropic besov spaces .",
    "the consistence properties of the estimators introduced in  @xcite can then be reformulated using sample paths properties of the model in anisotropic besov spaces .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide mathematical foundations of the empirical results of  @xcite . here , we prove what we call a _",
    "strong optimality result _ , namely that the critical exponent of the model in anisotropic besov spaces is maximal when the parameters of the analyzing space fit these of the analyzed textures , which is the exact transcription into a mathematical way of the empirical results of  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "s : model ] , we first present the studied self  similar anisotropic model . thereafter in section  [ s : besov ] , we recall some basic facts about anisotropic besov spaces . in section  [",
    "s : main ] we then state our main result .",
    "the proofs are postponed in section  [ s : proof ] .    in what follows ,",
    "we denote @xmath1 the collection of @xmath2 matrices whose eigenvalues have positive real parts .",
    "in  @xcite , we choosed to investigate the properties of a large class of anisotropic gaussian self - similar fields , introduced in  @xcite , referred as",
    "_ operator scaling gaussian random field _ , in short osgrf .    for any matrix @xmath3",
    "belonging in @xmath1 such that @xmath4 and any @xmath5 , this class can be defined using the following harmonizable representation : @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 stands for a 2d wiener measure . here",
    "@xmath10 is an @xmath3homogeneous continuous positive function , that is satisfies the following homogeneity relationship @xmath11 on @xmath12 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath13 which ensures the existence of the gaussian field @xmath14 ( see  @xcite ) .    with this construction ,",
    "the osgrf @xmath15 has stationary increments .",
    "further it satisfies an anisotropic version of the scaling property with parameter @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 denotes equality for all finite dimensional distributions ) : @xmath18 ( as usual @xmath19 ) .",
    "constructions of @xmath3homogeneous continuous positive function have been proposed in  @xcite via an integral formula ( theorem  2.11 ) .",
    "an alternative construction , more fitted for numerical simulations , can be found in  @xcite .",
    "let us now give a concrete example of osrgf .",
    "consider the case where @xmath20 with @xmath21 and set @xmath22 the function @xmath10 is obviously an @xmath3 homogeneous positive continuous fonction .",
    "for any @xmath23 , the associated gaussian field will be @xmath24 the scaling property satisfied by this field is then @xmath25",
    "our main goal here is to study the sample paths properties of this class of gaussian fields in suitable anisotropic functional spaces .",
    "this approach is quite natural ( see  @xcite ) since the studied model is anisotropic . to this end",
    ", suitable concepts of anisotropic smoothness are needed .",
    "the aim of this section is to give some background about the appropriate anisotropic functional spaces : anisotropic besov spaces .",
    "these spaces generalize classical ( isotropic ) besov spaces and have been studied in parallel with them .",
    "let @xmath26 a diagonalizable matrix of @xmath1 with eigenvalues @xmath27 and associated eigenvalues @xmath28 . the anisotropic besov spaces with anisotropy @xmath26 can be defined as follows ( see theorem  5.8 of @xcite )  :    [ d : besov ] let @xmath29 ^ 2 $ ] , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . for any @xmath32 set @xmath33 by definition @xmath34 the matrix @xmath26",
    "is called the anisotropy of the besov space @xmath35 .",
    "it is well  known that there exists a strong relationship between @xmath0 norms and classical wavelet coefficients ( see  @xcite ) . in  @xcite",
    ", our estimators are based on hyperbolic wavelet analysis . in  @xcite",
    ", we proved that @xmath0 norms of hyperbolic wavelet coefficients of a functions are related to its norms in anisotropic besov spaces .",
    "it is the reason why the natural mathematical framework to relate anisotropy and self  similar properties of the model to its sample paths properties is this of anisotropic besov spaces .",
    "[ rem : comp ] let @xmath26 a diagonalizable matrix of @xmath1 .",
    "for any @xmath36 , @xmath37 is also a diagonalizable matrix of @xmath1 with eigenvalues @xmath38 and same eigenvectors as @xmath26 .",
    "hence for any @xmath30 , @xmath39 .",
    "using remark  [ rem : comp ] , we deduce that without loss of generality , we can assume in the sequel that @xmath40 .",
    "we then define @xmath41 as it is the case for isotropic spaces , anisotropic hlder spaces @xmath42 can be defined as particular anisotropic besov spaces .",
    "let @xmath30 , @xmath43 .",
    "the anisotropic hlder spaces @xmath44 are defined by @xmath45    hence , a bounded function @xmath46 belongs to @xmath47 if and only if for any @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , one has @xmath51 for some @xmath52 , that is if and only if its restriction @xmath53 along any parametric curve of the form @xmath54 with @xmath49 is in the usual hlder space @xmath55 and @xmath56 does not depend on @xmath57 .",
    "roughly speaking , the anisotropic `` directional '' regularity in any anisotropic `` direction '' has to be larger than @xmath58 .",
    "in other words , we replace straight lines of isotropic setting by curves with parametric equation @xmath59 adapted to anisotropic setting .",
    "to state our optimality results we need a local version of anisotropic besov spaces  :    let @xmath60 be a fixed diagonalizable anisotropy , @xmath61 , @xmath43 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the function @xmath46 belongs to @xmath64 if for any @xmath65 , the function @xmath66 belongs to @xmath67 .    the anisotropic local critical exponent in anisotropic besov spaces @xmath68 of @xmath69 is then defined by @xmath70",
    "in what follows , we are given @xmath71 and @xmath72 an @xmath73homogeneous continuous positive function , @xmath74 .",
    "our results will be based on a comparison between the topology related to @xmath72 involved in the construction of the gaussian field @xmath75 defined by equation  ( [ d : model ] ) and this of the analyzing spaces @xmath76 . to be able to compare these two topologies",
    ", we also assume that @xmath77 .",
    "we characterize in some sense an anisotropy @xmath3 and an hurst index of the field @xmath78 , which is interesting when analyzing anisotropic self  similar textures . combining the results of this paper and these of  @xcite",
    ", our approach can thus be turned in an effective algorithm for the estimation of the anisotropy of self similar textures ( see  @xcite ) . in the case",
    "where @xmath79 , theorem  1 is the exact mathematical reformulation of equation ( 9 ) stated in  @xcite , on which are based the definition of the estimators of the anisotropy and smoothness of the model .",
    "our main result in then both a mathematical justification and an extension of the results empirically proved in  @xcite  :    [ thoptim ] let @xmath29 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "then almost surely @xmath80    in fact , theorem  [ thoptim ] contains two main results :    * the critical exponent of the field @xmath81 in anisotropic besov space @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the real diagonalizable part of @xmath3 ( see proposition 4.1 of  @xcite for a definition ) equals the associated hurst index @xmath16 .",
    "it has already been proved in @xcite in a general @xmath84dimensional context . * the diagonalizable real part @xmath83 of any anisotropy @xmath3 of the field",
    "@xmath81 maximizes this critical exponent among all possible analysis matrices .",
    "in fact , the `` best way '' of measuring smoothness of the field @xmath81 is to measure smoothness along the `` anisotropic directions '' @xmath85 , related to the genuine geometry of the field .",
    "proposition  5.2 of @xcite directly implies that a.s .",
    "@xmath86 we now prove that if @xmath26 is a diagonalizable matrix of @xmath87 then a.s . @xmath88",
    "denote @xmath83 the real diagonalizable part of @xmath3 ( see proposition 4.1 of  @xcite ) .",
    "observe now that , by theorem 1.1 of @xcite and lemma  5.1 of @xcite , one has a.s .",
    "@xmath89 where @xmath72 , @xmath90 are respectively two @xmath3 and @xmath83homogeneous continuous positive functions and @xmath81 , @xmath91 the associated gaussian fields by  ( [ d : model ] ) .",
    "one can then investigate the sample paths properties of @xmath91 instead of this of @xmath81 .",
    "hence from now , we then assume that @xmath3 equals its diagonalizable real part , namely that @xmath92 .",
    "even if @xmath26 and @xmath83 are both diagonalizable since these matrices are not commuting we can not assume that @xmath83 and @xmath26 are both diagonal .",
    "let @xmath93 .",
    "as above , one may assume @xmath94 .",
    "denote @xmath95 ( resp @xmath96 ) the two eigenvalues of @xmath83 ( resp .",
    "@xmath26 ) and @xmath97 ( resp @xmath98 ) some associated eigenvectors .",
    "we exclude the two cases @xmath99 , @xmath100 corresponding to the cases @xmath101 , @xmath102 which can be deduced from theorem 4.1 of @xcite . hence the inequalities between the eigenvalues are strict .",
    "* proof of lemma  [ lem : sep ] . *",
    "the only point to prove is that the case @xmath117 is impossible .",
    "suppose that this relationship holds .",
    "then one has @xmath118 since @xmath119 , it implies that @xmath120 that is @xmath121 since @xmath122 , it yields to a contradiction .",
    "let @xmath123 .",
    "then , by definition of @xmath58 one has @xmath124 and @xmath125 the , using the finite difference characterization of classical besov spaces , one deduces that @xmath126 . since , by proposition  5.6 of  @xcite , @xmath127 and @xmath128 it yields to a contradiction . +",
    "now suppose that point  ( 2 ) of lemma  [ lem : sep ] holds .",
    "assume that @xmath129 .",
    "the other case will be similar .",
    "observe that that if @xmath130 for some @xmath131 , one then has @xmath132 which is impossible since by assumption @xmath133 .",
    "then the family @xmath134 is necessarily a basis of @xmath12 .",
    "hence @xmath135 for some @xmath136 .",
    "by  ( [ e : h0 ] ) , for any @xmath137 one has a.s . @xmath138",
    "further , the triangular inequality and equation  ( [ e : e02 ] ) implies that @xmath139 set now @xmath140 and remark that @xmath141 in addition , @xmath142 .",
