    "in many cases , images and signals are observed on spherical manifolds .",
    "typical examples are astrophysics ( e.g. @xcite ) , topography @xcite and gravity fields sensing @xcite .",
    "further example is spherical microphone arrays , used for spatial beam forming @xcite and sound recording @xcite .",
    "a key tool for the analysis of signals on the sphere is spherical harmonics analysis , discussed in detail later on .",
    "for instance , the spherical microphone array was analyzed in terms of spherical harmonics in @xcite .",
    "additionally , spherical harmonics have been extensively used for various applications in computer graphics , such as modeling of volumetric scattering effects , bidirectional reflectance distribution function , and atmospheric scattering ( for more graphical applications , see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "spherical harmonics are also used in medical imaging @xcite , optical tomography @xcite , several applications in physics such as solving potential problem in electrostatics @xcite and the central potential schrdinger equation in quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "additional applications of spherical harmonics are sampling on the sphere @xcite and more recently , compressed sensing @xcite and sparse recovery @xcite . in some sense , our work relates to these latter fields .",
    "let @xmath1 denote the space of homogeneous spherical harmonics of degree @xmath2 , which is the restriction to the unit sphere of the homogeneous harmonic polynomials of degree @xmath2 in @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "each subspace @xmath1 is of dimension @xmath4 also , recall that @xmath5 .",
    "thus , if @xmath6 , @xmath7 , is an orthonormal basis of @xmath1 , then @xmath8 can be expanded as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 using the _ addition formula _",
    "@xcite , one can write the kernel of the projection onto @xmath1 as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is univariate ultraspherical gegenbauer polynomial of order @xmath13 and degree @xmath2 . thus , the projection kernel onto the space @xmath14 is given by @xmath15    in this work we consider the dirac ensemble @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a dirac measure , @xmath18 are real weights , and @xmath19 are distinct locations on the sphere .",
    "we recall the following definition    let @xmath20 be the borel @xmath21-algebra on a compact space @xmath22 , and denote by @xmath23 the associated space of real borel measures .",
    "the total variation of a real borel measure @xmath24 over a set @xmath25 is defined by @xmath26 where the supremum is taken over all partitions of @xmath27 into a finite number of disjoint measurable subsets .",
    "the total variation @xmath28 is a non - negative measure on @xmath20 , and the total variation ( tv ) norm of @xmath29 is defined as @xmath30    for a measure of the form of ( [ eq : signal ] ) , it is easy to see that @xmath31 in this paper we assume that the only information we have on the signal @xmath32 is its ` orthogonal projection ' onto @xmath33 , i.e , @xmath34 to ensure exact recovery of the dirac ensemble from its projection onto @xmath35 , we impose a separation condition as in @xcite for the case of trigonometric polynomials and @xcite for the case of algebraic polynomials over @xmath36 $ ] . to this end ,",
    "recall that the distance on the sphere between any two points @xmath37 is given by @xmath38    [ def : separation ] a set of points @xmath39 is said to satisfy the minimal separation condition for ( sufficiently large ) @xmath40 if @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a fixed constant that does not depend on @xmath40 .    the main theorem of this paper concerns exact recovery in the case @xmath43 , i.e. the sphere @xmath44    let @xmath45 be the support of a signed measure of the form ( [ eq : signal ] ) .",
    "let @xmath46 be any spherical harmonics basis for @xmath47 and let @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 . if @xmath51 satisfies the separation condition of definition [ def : separation ]",
    ", then @xmath32 is the unique solution of @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the space of signed borel measures on @xmath44 .",
    "[ th : main ]    observe that for applications , theorem [ th : main ] is stronger than needed . indeed , since the form of ( the unknown ) @xmath32 is known",
    ", one may perform tv minimization over the smaller subspace of dirac superpositions over the sphere .",
    "practical numerical algorithms that leverage on this result are presented in @xcite . also , we strongly believe that this result holds in higher dimensions and indeed significant parts of the proof can be easily generalized to any dimension . however , there are certain technical challenges ( see section [ subsection - inversion ] ) which we hope to overcome in future work .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "dual ] we recall the dual problem of interpolating polynomials . in section",
    "[ sec : loc ] we provide details on the essential ingredient of the dual polynomial construction , which is a well - localized polynomial kernel . in section",
    "[ sec : construct ] we carry out the actual construction of the interpolating polynomial . in section [ sec : non - negative ] we review the simpler case of signals with non - negative coefficients , where the separation condition can be replaced by a significantly weaker assumption of sparsity .",
    "i.e. that the number of diracs is @xmath54 .    finally , we point out that the main result of the paper is of qualitative nature in the following sense . throughout the proofs we will have for some @xmath55 , elements of the type @xmath56 , where @xmath57 are absolute constants that depend only on @xmath58 , but change from estimate to estimate and @xmath42 is the constant from definition [ def : separation ] .",
    "once all estimates are done , @xmath42 is selected to be sufficiently large so that @xmath56 and similar quantities are sufficiently small . in this paper",
    ", we do not deal with the problem of the sharpness of the constant @xmath42 .",
    "the proof of theorem [ th : main ] can be reduced to a problem in polynomial interpolation .",
    "this result in its general form is given in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "for completeness , we provide here the proof for the case of real coefficients    let @xmath59 , where @xmath60 , and @xmath22 is a compact manifold in @xmath61 .",
    "let @xmath62 be a linear space of continuous functions of dimension @xmath63 in @xmath22 .",
    "for any basis @xmath64 of @xmath62 , let @xmath65 for all @xmath66 .",
    "if for any set @xmath67 , @xmath68 , with @xmath69 , there exists @xmath70 such that @xmath71 then @xmath32 is the unique real borel measure satisfying @xmath72 [ th : duality ]    let @xmath73 be a solution of ( [ eq : dual1 ] ) , and define @xmath74 .",
    "the difference measure @xmath75 can be decomposed relative to @xmath76 as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is concentrated in @xmath51 , and @xmath79 is concentrated in @xmath80 ( the complementary of @xmath51 ) . note that if @xmath81 , than @xmath82 also , otherwise @xmath83 , which is a contradiction .",
    "thus , in such as case , @xmath84 and @xmath32 is the unique minimizer of ( [ eq : dual1 ] ) . performing a polar decomposition of @xmath85 yields @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a function on @xmath22 with values @xmath88 ( see e.g. @xcite ) . by assumption",
    ", there exists @xmath70 obeying @xmath89 also by assumption @xmath90 , for @xmath66 , and so @xmath91 equation ( [ eq : in_pro ] ) , with the polar decomposition of @xmath78 and ( [ eq : q_xm ] ) imply @xmath92 if @xmath82 , then @xmath93 , and @xmath84 .",
    "alternatively , if @xmath94 , we conclude by property ( [ eq : q_x ] ) that @xmath95 thus , @xmath96 as a result of ( [ eq : nsp ] ) , we get @xmath97 which is a contradiction .",
    "therefore , @xmath84 , which implies that @xmath32 is the unique solution of ( [ eq : dual1 ] ) .    in the figure",

    "indeed , @xmath113 can be bounded from below by @xmath114 as follows .",
    "since @xmath115 and @xmath116 , @xmath117 , the normalization @xmath118 , gives @xmath119 the derivative formula ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath120 implies @xmath121 hence , by the properties of @xmath122 ( see ( [ def - rho ] ) ) @xmath123    our construction requires the right form of differentiation . to this end",
    "we employ the lie - algebra structure on the sphere ( see section 4.2.2 in @xcite for more details ) . for any @xmath124 ,",
