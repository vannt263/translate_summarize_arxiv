    "susy is perhaps the most promising candidate for physics beyond the standard model ; it also provides a good test of detector performance .",
    "the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite collaborations at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) have therefore devoted a lot of effort to studying susy signatures and measurements .",
    "this talk provides an overview of that work with emphasis on new results since the overviews in ref .   and .",
    "the susy cross section at the lhc is dominated by the associated strong production of gluinos and squarks .",
    "if @xmath0 parity is conserved , these decay into the lightest susy particle @xmath1 , which escapes the detector , plus quarks , gluons , and perhaps other standard model particles . thus , susy provides signatures containing at least jets and large missing transverse energy @xmath2 .",
    "the lhc should be able to observe these signals for @xmath3 and @xmath4 masses up to about @xmath5 with only @xmath6 of integrated luminosity .",
    "the challenge at the lhc is not to discover tev - scale susy ( assuming it exists ) but to make precision measurements of masses and other quantities .",
    "since the decay products of each susy particle contain an invisible @xmath1 , no mass peaks can be reconstructed directly .",
    "instead , masses must be inferred  @xcite from kinematic endpoints and other properties of the events .",
    "developing methods to do this has been a main emphasis of the studies to date .",
    "typically , events are simulated for a particular susy model and for the standard model backgrounds using a parton shower monte carlo program such as herwig  @xcite , isajet  @xcite , or pythia  @xcite , the detector response is simulated using a fast parameterization , cuts are made to give a good signal / background , and various kinematic distributions are reconstructed .",
    "a number of examples are presented below .",
    "since @xmath3 and @xmath4 are strongly produced , their cross sections are comparable to qcd at the same @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath0 parity is conserved , their decays produce distinctive events with large @xmath2 .",
    "a typical analysis requires at least four jets with @xmath8 and @xmath9 and plots as a measure of @xmath7 the quantity @xmath10 for large @xmath11 the standard model background is typically 10% of the signal .",
    "the reach is thus limited mainly by the @xmath3 and @xmath4 production cross sections and hence masses .",
    "this reach is shown for the minimal sugra model in fig .",
    "[ catania18 ] .",
    "note that the sensitivity for one month at 10% of design luminosity is about @xmath12 . of course it will take more than one month to understand the detectors , but nevertheless one might hope for an interesting talk at susy08 .",
    "squark and gluino decays typically involve one or more intermediate charginos or neutralinos , giving rise to multi - lepton signatures as well as ones involving jets .",
    "the reach for such signatures is shown in figure  [ d_denegri_1266c ] .",
    "the emergence of the susy signal from the standard model background is illustrated for a typical case in figure  [ tovey02 ] .",
    "also shown is the correlation between the peak of the @xmath11 distribution and @xmath13 obviously , however , any such inclusive correlation is model dependent .    while the reach plots in figure  [ catania18 ] apply only to msugra , similar reach in gluino and squark masses should apply to any model in which they decay into an invisible and relatively light @xmath1 .",
    "some models are easier .",
    "for example , gmsb models with prompt @xmath14 or @xmath15 decays provide additional photon or lepton handles to suppress standard model backgrounds .",
    "gmsb models with a quasi - stable @xmath16 provide a penetrating charged particle with @xmath17 that is well measured by the muon detectors .",
    "amsb models give few single leptons but larger @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath0 parity is violated via @xmath18 or @xmath19 , there are again additional leptons .",
    "perhaps the most difficult case is @xmath0-violation via @xmath20 , giving multiple jets but no @xmath21 jets .",
    "the background is poorly known , but it seems likely that one must rely on leptonic cascade decays . in general , however , discovery of gluinos and squarks with masses of order @xmath22 appears straightforward .",
    "masses of @xmath23 are of course much more difficult and would probably need a luminosity upgrade .",
    "if @xmath0 parity is conserved , then the @xmath1 is invisible and there are no mass peaks .",
    "nevertheless , kinematic endpoints allow one to determine mass combinations .",
    "the simplest example is the decay    for the dilepton signature , events are selected to have two leptons with ( typically ) @xmath24 and @xmath25 in addition to multiple hard jets and large @xmath2 .",
    "then the dominant standard model background is @xmath26 .",
    "the background from @xmath26 or from any other standard model source involving two independent decays cancels in the combination @xmath27 .",
    "the same is true for two independent chargino decays in msugra , and it is likely to be true in any susy model that avoids @xmath28 and other low - energy constraints .    an opposite - sign , same - flavor dilepton signature can arise from a 2-body cascade decay @xmath29 , from a 3-body @xmath30 decay , or from a decay via a @xmath31 .",
    "all three cases are illustrated in figure  [ blois ] .",
    "they are clearly distinguished by shape .",
    "such endpoints are observable over a significant fraction of the msugra parameter space , as illustrated in figure  [ cmsll ] . in particular ,",
    "a large part of the msugra parameter space with acceptable cold dark matter has light sleptons and hence enhanced @xmath32 decays .",
    "when a longer decay chain can be identified , more combinations of masses can be measured .",
    "for example , at msugra point  5 , the dominant source of dileptons is @xmath33 . the gluino is heavier than the squarks , and",
    "the hardest jets generally come from the squarks .",
    "in such a case , one can form an @xmath34 endpoint and two @xmath35 endpoints in addition to the @xmath32 one  @xcite .",
    "in addition , if a lower limit on the @xmath32 mass is imposed , there is also an @xmath36 threshold .",
    "all of these distributions after experimental selections are shown in figure  [ camb5new ] .",
    "the endpoints and thresholds can all be expressed in terms of the masses involved using elementary kinematics , and they provide enough constraints to determine the masses .",
    "the results taking estimated errors into account for the @xmath1 and @xmath37 masses are shown in figure  [ camb15 ] for two models with similar masses .",
    "all the masses involved are determined quite accurately as functions of @xmath38 ; in particular the two models can be easily distinguished .",
    "the @xmath1 mass is determined to about 10% through its effect on the kinematics even though it is invisible .",
    "an alternative approach is to reconstruct @xmath39 momentum assuming that the @xmath1 mass is known and using @xmath40 while this is exact only for a 3-body @xmath41 at the endpoint , it can be used as an approximation elsewhere .",
    "an analysis for sugra point b ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) using this method looks for @xmath47 .",
    "the dilepton distribution after cuts and the reconstructed @xmath48 distribution using @xmath49 are shown in figure  [ tricomi ] .",
    "a second @xmath21 can be added to reconstruct the gluino mass ; see ref .  .",
    "if the decay @xmath51 is kinematically allowed , it often has a substantial branching ratio .",
    "the decay @xmath50 can be reconstructed by selecting events with multiple jets plus large @xmath2 and plotting the mass of pairs of jets tagged as @xmath21 s .",
    "the reach for this signature in msugra , shown in figure  [ cmshbb ] , covers a substantial fraction of parameter space",
    ". it might well be the discovery mode for the light susy higgs .",
    "if @xmath50 can be reconstructed , it can then be combined with jets to determine other masses . in figure  [ p5_mbbj ] for example ,",
    "the @xmath52 was combined with each of the two hardest jets in the event ; the smaller of these masses should be less than the @xmath53 endpoint .",
    "this measurement is less precise than those involving leptons , but it may be useful if the leptonic branching ratios are small .",
    "susy events can be much more complex than those for the cases discussed above .",
    "an example is the `` focus point '' region : in msugra as @xmath54 becomes large for fixed values of the other parameters , @xmath55 and radiative electroweak symmetry breaking fails . near this boundary",
    ", the @xmath1 is dominantly higgsino , leading to acceptable values of cold dark matter  @xcite .",
    "the exact location of the focus point region is very sensitive to details of the susy spectrum calculation  @xcite , but such a region surely exists .    in one calculation",
    "@xcite the msugra point @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 is close to the @xmath58 focus point boundary . since the squarks are heavy , susy production is dominated by @xmath59 pairs .",
    "the largest @xmath3 branching ratios are calculated  @xcite to be @xmath60 .",
    "these decays give events with 1216 jets and leptons !",
    "the methods described previously suffice to find such signals .",
    "many of the basic starting points discussed previously also work ; see for example figure  [ c1500mll ] . but sorting out the combinatorial background in such complex events is quite difficult and has not yet been solved .",
    "@xmath0-parity violation with @xmath61 , and especially @xmath62 is another example of a susy model with very complex signatures . in such models",
    "the signal has very high jet multiplicity  nominally six jets just from the @xmath1 decays  few or no @xmath21 jets that might be used to reduce the combinatorial background , and small @xmath2 .",
    "the qcd background for such events is not well known ; the 1-loop qcd corrections to the production of 6 - 10 jets seem unlikely to be calculated even by the end of lhc running .",
    "estimates based on qcd shower monte carlo programs suggest that the backgrounds are comparable to the signals , but this is at best a rough estimate .    for such scenarios , therefore , it is probably necessary to rely on susy cascade decays , e.g. , @xmath63 , to provide additional handles to suppress the qcd background .",
    "one example that has been studied uses such decays with branching ratios taken from msugra point 5 . even though there are no missing particles , reconstruction is difficult because the jets from the @xmath1 are soft and the mass resolution is only @xmath64 . define the mass combinations @xmath65 ; then the jet resolution largely cancels for @xmath66 , as can be seen in figure  [ camb6a ] . the distributions in figure  [ camrviol ] show reasonable distributions in these variables .",
    "these are just two examples of susy scenarios giving complex signatures .",
    "such scenarios are certainly possible , and much more work is needed to develop analysis strategies to deal with them .",
    "the initial motivation for studying @xmath67 signatures came from the fact that for large regions of msugra parameter space with @xmath68 the only two - body decay modes are @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "then these modes have branching ratios close to 100% , and all ssuy decays involve @xmath67 s .",
    "such scenarios are disfavored because they tend to give contributions to @xmath71 much larger than observed .",
    "low - energy tests of the standard model seem to require that the first two generations of squarks and sleptons be nearly degenerate .",
    "this degeneracy is not understood in general but does occur in msugra . even in msugra , however , the third generation of squarks and sleptons is split by renormalization group and left - right mixing effects .",
    "thus , study of the third generation is likely to be essential for understanding susy .",
    "because of technical constraints , the atlas and cms vertex detectors do not have sufficient resolution to identify @xmath67 decays cleanly .",
    "hence , leptonic @xmath67 decays can not be distinguished from prompt leptons , and @xmath67 s can only be identified using narrow , one - prong jets , for which there is substantial qcd background . as can be seen from figure  [ tdr9 - 31 ] ,",
    "the typical jet rejection is a factor of about 100 for a @xmath67 efficiency of 50% .    for msugra with @xmath72 , @xmath44 , @xmath73",
    ", the only 2-body decays of light gauginos are @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "these decays therefore dominate .",
    "since there is @xmath2 both from @xmath76 s and from @xmath1 s , the @xmath67 distributions can only be inferred from their hadronic decay products . instead of a sharp @xmath77 edge at @xmath78 , one would observe the distribution shown in figure  [ p6subtracted ] .",
    "the visible @xmath67 momentum depends both on the momentum and on the polarization of the parent @xmath67 .",
    "the decay @xmath79 is maximally sensitive to the polarization while high - mass decays are rather insensitive to it .",
    "a study of the separation of different decay modes has been carried out using a full geant - based simulation of @xmath67 s from susy events in the atlas detector .",
    "the visible @xmath67 mass is reconstructed by combining charged tracks and electromagnetic calorimeter cells , exploiting the fine granularity of the calorimeter .",
    "the reconstructed masses , figure  [ mtaunew ] , show a good separation of @xmath80 decays and some difference between @xmath81 and @xmath82 decays .",
    "the same figure indicates the sensitivity of the @xmath77 mass distribution to a reversal of helicities .",
    "in gmsb models the lightest susy particle is the light gravitino @xmath83 .",
    "the phenomenology depends on nature and lifetime of the next lightest particle ( nlsp ) , which can be either the @xmath1 or a @xmath16 .",
    "decays into @xmath83 lead to more distinctive events and to longer decay chains , such as @xmath84 , that can be used to determine susy masses  @xcite .",
    "the lifetime for the nlsp to decay to a @xmath83 is unknown and is an important parameter of the model .",
    "short @xmath14 lifetimes can be measured by selecting dalitz decays and using the vertex detector . for @xmath85",
    "the signature is occasional photons that do no point to the primary vertex .",
    "the atlas electromagnetic calorimeter was designed to measure photon angles with @xmath86 to improve the @xmath87 mass resolution .",
    "it also has good time resolution , @xmath88 .",
    "both can be exploited to detect long - lived @xmath14 decays with good efficiency , as seen in figurereftdr20 - 65 .",
    "if no signal is seen , an upper limit of order @xmath89 could be established  @xcite .",
    "a long - lived slepton nlsp would give tracks with @xmath17 through the calorimeter and muon system .",
    "these can be well identified by using the muon system as a time of flight system , as can be seen in figure  [ cmsmstau ]  @xcite .",
    "the lifetime can be estimated by counting the number of events with zero , one , and two such tracks , as is also shown in figure  [ cmsmstau ] .",
    "it should also be possible to determine the lifetime by looking for kinks in the central tracker , but developing the needed pattern recognition algorithm is non - trivial and has not yet been attempted .",
    "if susy exists with masses below about @xmath22 , it seems likely that the atlas and cms detectors should find evidence for it shortly after the lhc begins operation .",
    "only a limited number of susy models and cases have been investigated so far , and in all cases the answer has been known .",
    "these studies seem sufficient , however , to sketch the broad outlines of an initial program of susy measurements ( assuming that @xmath0 parity is conserved ) :    1 .",
    "search for an excess of multijet + @xmath2 events over standard model predictions , which of course must be checked against other measurements . 2 .",
    "if such an excess is found , select a sample of susy with simple cuts such as those described above .",
    "look for special features such as @xmath90 s or long - lived @xmath16 s in these events .",
    "look for @xmath91 , @xmath32 , @xmath92 , @xmath21 jets , hadronic @xmath67 decays , etc .",
    "try simple endpoint - type analyses such as those described above .",
    "there is of course much more information available , including cross sections , branching ratios , and other kinematic distributions .",
    "ultimately one will want to use the first measurements to guide further analyses incorporating all the information . this program will need the full power of the lhc and its detectors .",
