    "from the formation of snowflakes to lightning , from mineral veins to bacterial colonies , the theory of laplacian growth with its generalizations and extensions has highly contributed to our current understanding of far - from - equilibrium growth phenomena @xcite . in particular , one striking phenomenological feature of this kind of systems",
    "is the morphological changes they undergo as a result of the interplay of the entropic , energetic and symmetry elements in their growth dynamics .",
    "this trends have been widely observed experimentally and , in some cases , successfully reproduced by computer simulations so that seemingly unrelated patterns found in nature are now understood in terms of a single generalized framework of complex growth @xcite",
    ". however , complexity in nature seems to follow non - trivial paths revealed in self - organizing and self - assembling processes that in most cases are characterized by critical and/or morphological transitions that can not be properly described by the laplacian growth models @xcite .    in the laplacian theory ,",
    "the probability of growth at a given point in space , @xmath0 , is proportional to the spatial variation of a scalar field , @xmath1 , with @xmath2 .",
    "one example of such processes is the paradigmatic diffusion - limited aggregation ( dla ) model , where particles following brownian trajectories aggregate one - by - one to form a cluster , starting with a seed particle @xcite ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "it has been found that the disordered structure that emerges from this kind of processes shows self - similarity , described by a single fractal dimension @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "mean - field analyses have shown that this fractal dimension depends only on the dimension @xmath4 of the space where the cluster grows as , @xmath5 @xcite . in two dimensions ,",
    "this expression predicts @xmath6 , that is not very far from the widely reported value for off - lattice dla clusters , @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , the fact that the fractal features of these clusters are highly dependent on the mean square displacement of the particles in the trajectories they follow before aggregation , gives rise to a continuous screening - driven morphological transition that has been neatly described by extending the laplacian theory to consider a general aggregation process where particles follow fractal trajectories @xcite .",
    "the cluster s fractal dimension is then related to that of the walkers trajectories , @xmath8 , through the honda - toyoki - matsushita ( htm ) mean - field equation , @xmath9 , where @xmath4 is the dimension of the embedding space @xcite . here , for @xmath10 one",
    "gets @xmath11 , as expected for ballistic - aggregation ( ba ) dynamics , whereas for @xmath12 , the value @xmath13 for dla is recovered .",
    "this kinetically induced ba - dla transition has been reproduced in diverse and equivalent aggregation schemes , for example , under drift of wandering particles @xcite , using particles with variable random - walk step size @xcite , by imposing directional correlations @xcite , and through probabilistically mixed - dynamics aggregation @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , one of the most challenging aspects of the theory arises when the growth is not purely limited by diffusive processes , for example , when it takes place under the presence of long - range attractive interactions or under the effects of surface tension , where strong screening and anisotropic effects must be taken into account @xcite . for this",
    ", a clever generalization to the diffusion - limited growth processes was proposed within the context of the dielectric - breakdown ( db ) model , assuming @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a positive real number associated with non - linear effects coming from screening and anisotropy @xcite , while a very good description of the self - similarity in the emerging structures was provided by the generalized htm equation ( ghtm ) @xcite , @xmath16 this equation predicts a continuous morphological transition , from a compact structure with @xmath11 ( ba ) as @xmath17 , to a one - dimensional one in the highly anisotropic regime , i.e. , @xmath18 as @xmath19 . in particular , for two - dimensional diffusive - type processes ( @xmath20 ) , the value @xmath13 is recovered for @xmath21 . due to the limitations of this expression , coming from its mean - field approach , extensive numerical work has been invested to prove the transition from branching fractals to one - dimensional non - fractal clusters at the critical value @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the use of the fractal dimension as an order parameter to describe these transitions is still debatable as well .",
    "these are some of the important aspects we will address in this article .",
    "* fundamental models of aggregation .",
    "* after been launched into the system from @xmath23 with uniform probability , particles ( * a * ) follow straight - line trajectories before aggregation takes place in ba , ( * b * ) perform a random walk in dla , and ( * c * ) get radially attached to the closest particle in the cluster as a result of an infinite - range ( system - size ) radial interaction in mf aggregation .",
    "the latter is particle - path independent and its morphological characteristics emerge solely from this long - range interaction as opposed to the stochastic ba and dla models .",
    "the characteristic fractal dimension @xmath24 for each type of aggregation process is indicated.,scaledwidth=55.0% ]",
    "for our numerical analysis we considered a combinatorial ( monte carlo ) scheme of three fundamental and simple two - dimensional _ off - lattice _ models of particle - cluster aggregation . on the one hand , the dla and ba models will provide us with disordered / fractal structures through the full range of stochastic aggregation dynamics ( figs .",
    "1a and 1b ) . on the other , the long - range particle - cluster interactive mean - field ( mf ) model",
    "will be an agent of order , providing the most energetic ( or noiseless ) aggregation dynamics @xcite , as well as acting as the main source of anisotropy , in this case purely generated by the growth dynamics but not from lattice effects @xcite ( see fig .",
    "1c ) . the fractional combination of these models , controlled by the mixing parameter @xmath25 $ ] , results in dla - mf and ba - mf transitions , going from homogeneous fractal structures with @xmath26 when @xmath27 , passing through inhomogeneous multifractal structures , to non - fractal structures with @xmath18 as @xmath28 .",
    "before discussing these results in details in the next section , let us develop a general framework to analyze morphological transitions in stochastic growth processes .",
    "using the fractal dimension of the clusters @xmath3 , to characterize a given morphological transition , let us define the function @xmath29 as a real and positive monotonically - increasing continuous function of @xmath30 . here , @xmath31 takes a similar role as @xmath15 in the db model , associated with the net effects of all screening / anisotropy - driven growth forces , that is , all the symmetry - breaking effects , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are two positive real numbers associated with the strength of these forces , while @xmath30 modulates the anisotropy in such a way that @xmath34 as @xmath35 , and @xmath36 as @xmath37 ; @xmath25 $ ] as before .",
    "these mathematical characteristics make plausible to define a general dimensionality ( gd ) function , @xmath38 , that describes the fractal hausdorff dimension of a structure that collapses to @xmath18 under the effects of @xmath31 as , @xmath39 where @xmath24 is the fractal dimension of clusters produced in the most isotropic and stochastic scenario , i.e. , in the absence of any anisotropy - driven forces , while the exponential function allows us to consider all of the powers of @xmath30 .",
    "equation ( 2 ) is characterized by an inflection point , @xmath40 , that must satisfy @xmath41 which , for the choice of @xmath31 , will be given by @xmath42^{1/\\chi}.\\ ] ]    the first - order approximation ( gd@xmath43 ) of the general dimensionality function ( 2 ) can be written as , @xmath44 with an inflection point that must now satisfy @xmath45 , and is given by @xmath46^{1/\\chi}.\\ ] ]    as shown , these expressions predict a continuous morphological transition from @xmath47 as @xmath34 ( disordered / fractal state ) towards @xmath48 as @xmath49 ( ordered state ) , with an expected change in growth dynamics at @xmath40 .",
    "additionally , we will also define the reduced dimensionality ( rd ) function as the transformation @xmath50 , with @xmath51 $ ] , that leaves the inflection - point of equations ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) invariant , given by @xmath52 the first - order approximation ( rd@xmath43 ) becomes , @xmath53 where @xmath31 is given as before .    in the following section we will use these expressions to analyze some important cases .",
    "for all of our numerically generated clusters , the fractal dimension was measured by means of two standard procedures : the two - point density radial correlation function @xmath54 and the radius of gyration @xmath55 , that yield @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively ( see methods for more details ) .              in the anisotropy - driven dla - mf and ba - mf transitions ,",
    "the variable @xmath30 is associated with the fraction of particles aggregated under mf dynamics , that is @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is total number of particles .",
    "therefore , as @xmath30 varies from @xmath60 ( dla or ba ) to @xmath61 ( mf ) , it controls the morphology of the system through a continuous and extremely fast symmetry - breaking induced by the anisotropy of the mf dynamics ( see figs .",
    "2a and 3a ) .",
    "contrary to the screening - driven ba - dla transition @xcite , the clusters generated by these processes are inhomogeneous fractals , this is , structures with different fractal dimensionality at different scales ( see figs .",
    "2b , 2c , 3b , and 3c ) .",
    "even more , these transitions are characterized by fast and well - defined changes in growth dynamics as @xmath30 changes , therefore , they can no longer be properly described by the ghtm model . in contrast , the proposed gd function can be used to estimate the measured fractal dimensions of the clusters at different scales , using @xmath32 and @xmath33 as fitting parameters .",
    "in fact , we found that numerically obtained data for @xmath62 are well described by the gd function , whereas gd@xmath43 describes best the dependence of @xmath63 ( fig .",
    "2b and 3b ) .",
    "furthermore , even though it is possible to define the inflection points for each curve , the inhomogeneity of the clusters makes it impossible to establish a well - defined morphological critical point in the same manner as for the db model , that is , a point where highly anisotropic effects are dominant in determining the morphology of the clusters @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , such a description is possible in our new framework under proper rescaling as explained later .",
    "one important implication that can be drawn from the previous analysis , comes from the role of @xmath32 in describing the fractality of these clusters . in the ba - dla transition ,",
    "both @xmath32 and @xmath33 are constant , leading to homogeneous fractals @xcite .",
    "this is seen by rewriting the ghtm equation in terms of @xmath30 as , @xmath64 , with @xmath65 .",
    "the htm equation that describes the ba - dla transition , is recovered for @xmath66 .",
    "this is also the case for the db model where @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , these parameters have different values in the dla - mf and ba - mf transitions , depending on the scale in which @xmath62 and @xmath63 are measured ( see figs .",
    "2b and 3b ) .",
    "this suggest that , in order to have a transition characterized by homogeneous fractals , the amplitude of the screening / anisotropic force , @xmath32 , must remain constant along the transition and across different scales .",
    "this is also supported by noticing that @xmath32 will be bounded by the limit value of the gd function when @xmath37 , i.e. , when all of the particles follow mf dynamics . in this limit , @xmath68 ,",
    "must satisfy @xmath69 ( from its definition ) , which would lead to @xmath70 .",
    "this is a convergence condition in the highly anisotropic regime that is better defined by considering @xmath71 , where @xmath72 , is a measure of the deviation from a given structure to fully collapsing into a one - dimensional one .",
    "this condition leads to @xmath73 $ ] , that establishes a lower bound , not only for @xmath32 , but for @xmath74 as well .",
    "thus , given a @xmath24 ( also bounded by @xmath4 , i.e. , the dimension of the embedding space ) , @xmath32 has a lower bound that depends only on @xmath75 .",
    "this implies that long - correlated structures are not restricted to develop a single scaling - law or mono - fractal features , and that inhomogeneous or _ multi - fractal structures _ are more likely to arise in these out - of - equilibrium growth processes .",
    "further evidence supporting this observation is provided bellow .",
    "the proposed gd function and its first - order approximation are powerful phenomenological expression , able to describe the fractality of the clusters at different scales and along the transitions , as well as the changes in growth regimes through the inflection points ( see fig .",
    "however , a full insight into the nature of these transitions is needed , in particular , the possibility of defining morphological critical points ( as previously done for the db model in @xcite ) . to this end , let us notice that under the scaled variable , @xmath76 , it is possible to collapse all the data for @xmath74 into a single curve according to their respective transition and measurement method ( see fig .",
    "this implies that the symmetry - breaking induced by the anisotropy - driven force is a unique process whose manifestations are the same across all of the scales .",
    "moreover , given the uniqueness of these processes , we are in the possibility of defining critical points by substituting @xmath77 , back into the gd function , leading to , @xmath78 where @xmath79 , with @xmath80 , is associated to a generalized anisotropy - driven force .",
    "its first - order approximation ( gd@xmath43 ) is given by , @xmath81 where @xmath79 , with @xmath82 . by construction ,",
    "all inflection points are now located at @xmath83 .",
    "fitting these functions to @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively , we obtain the curves shown in fig .",
    "4b , that are in excellent agreement with the data .",
    "in particular , in this approach @xmath32 depends only on @xmath33 , thus providing further evidence to support our argument about the origins of mono or multi - fractality in these morphological transitions .",
    "furthermore , by plotting all data for @xmath84 and @xmath85 as function of @xmath86 , it can be observed that both the dla - mf and ba - mf transitions equally approach the highly anisotropic regime , showing that the symmetry - breaking process driven by @xmath87 is independent of the initial configuration of the system , as shown in fig .",
    "this can be better appreciated by using the reduced dimensionality transformation to plot @xmath88 and @xmath89 as function of @xmath87 ( see fig .",
    "4d ) , under which one can observe the full collapsing of the data into single universal curves that are perfectly described by the reduced dimensionality ( rd ) function and its first - order approximation ( rd@xmath43 ) given respectively by , @xmath90    in fact , since @xmath24 can be well described by the htm model as @xmath91 , and given that these symmetry - breaking processes are initial - configuration independent , we might conclude that these fractal to non - fractal morphological transitions will depend solely on the strength of the anisotropic - driven force acting upon them , following the same universal fractality curves in any dimension .    regarding this universality concept",
    ", we must recall that the dielectric breakdown and even viscous fingering phenomena are said to belong to the same universality class as dla , because they are characterized by the same fractal dimension , generated by related laplacian growth processes , and not because any other thermodynamic criteria @xcite .",
    "therefore , the _ universality _ of these morphological dla - mf and ba - mf transitions must be understood in the sense as they are described by the same general equations in the @xmath92-space , independent of the dimensionality of their embedding space .",
    "note that due to this universality feature , in this reduced space these transitions can be seen as a regular phase - transition .",
    "for this , let us define the _ critical point _ of these transitions analogously to that of the db model , i.e. , as the point where the fractal dimension of the clusters is slightly different from the dimension of a one - dimensional structure @xcite .",
    "this can be achieved by considering @xmath93 , where @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , from the rd and rd@xmath43 functions , the _ universal critical points _ , @xmath95 , must satisfy , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively . in order to recover the particular critical points for each transition , we must recall that @xmath98 then , one has to solve for @xmath99 accordingly .",
    "notice also that in this case , @xmath99 depends on @xmath100 , @xmath33 and @xmath24 , therefore , giving different values for each transition ( table i ) .",
    "as previously stated , the ghtm mean - field equation that describes the fractality of clusters generated in the db model gives @xmath6 , for @xmath21 ( dla ) .",
    "this can be corrected by noticing that equation ( 1 ) , re - written as @xmath101 , is similar to the description given by the first - order approximation equation @xmath102 , with the peculiarity that , in this case , @xmath103 . considering @xmath104 , the corrected ghtm equation ( gd@xmath43-@xmath32 ) is given by , @xmath105 . in two dimensions , setting @xmath21 and @xmath7 yields @xmath106 .",
    "furthermore , this equation can now be identified as the first - order approximation of a general function ( gd-@xmath32 ) given by , @xmath107 which , for @xmath108 , is in excellent agreement with previous numerical results @xcite ( see table ii ) .",
    "this db transition draws interesting similarities with the ba - mf transition , since both of them exhibit a symmetry - breaking from @xmath11 to @xmath18 , have critical points close to @xmath109 , and @xmath110 , for @xmath111 and @xmath21 , even though we are dealing with completely different growth processes ( see fig .  4b and table i ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "since the db model is associated to a generalized laplacian process described by @xmath112 , one would be tempted to associate the ba - mf model to a similar processes where @xmath113 .",
    "however , it will not be correct because both processes would become equivalent and the numerical solution of the equation would result in the generation of equivalent morphological clusters , which is obviously incorrect .",
    "moreover , another important difference between the db and ba - mf description , is that the case @xmath21 will not be associated with any inflection point in the dynamics , as it is the case for @xmath83 , since the condition @xmath114 is not satisfied , as can be seen from simple inspection of the gd function .",
    "interestingly enough , if the case @xmath21 could have been directly related to the case @xmath83 , this would have indicated that the dla process is directly associated to an inflection point in the dynamics and not to a critical point as was suggested through a completely different approach @xcite .",
    "worthy of remark is that our approach provides the corrected form for all the previous mean - field equation for the fractality of the generalized laplacian processes , within the first - order approximation of the general gd-@xmath32 equation , given by , @xmath115 whose first - order approximation , gd@xmath43-@xmath32 , is given by , @xmath116 where , @xmath117 , thus unifying all of the models . as such , the corrected ghtm equation for the db model",
    "is recovered by setting @xmath12 ; the corrected htm equation for the ba - dla transition is recovered for @xmath21 ; and the corrected dla mean - field equation is recovered for @xmath12 and @xmath21 . finally and importantly , under the reduced dimensionality transformation , equations gd-@xmath32 and gd@xmath43-@xmath32 are respectively given by @xmath118 and @xmath119 , with @xmath120 , showing that they belong to the same universality class as the dla - mf and ba - mf transitions ( see figs .",
    "4c and 4d ) .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     on a separate note , given that in all of these transitions @xmath56 and @xmath57 are finelly well described by the rd and rd@xmath43 functions , respectively , this indeed suggests that the true fractal dimension of dla clusters is @xmath121 , whereas @xmath7 is its value at first - order approximation .",
    "this observation is in good agreement with some results previously reported based on robust methods such as the two - point density correlation function , while results based on fast methods such as the radius of gyration report values close to 1.71 @xcite ( see also extended data ) .      in this work we present a set of dimensionality functions that provide an useful and powerful description of the fractality in the anisotropy - driven dla - mf and ba - mf transitions . under a generalized anisotropy - force approach and a reduced dimensionality transformation",
    ", these transitions follow universal curves , showing that they are independent of their initial fractal dimension , and only dependent on the anisotropy force acting upon them .",
    "also , provided that the initial fractal dimension is a function of the dimensionality of the embedding space ( as described by the htm equation ) , these results reveal the universality of these fractal to non - fractal morphological transitions . as well",
    ", we also show that the db model ( the generalized laplacian model ) belongs to the same universality - class , sharing similarities with the ba - mf model such as critical points and close values of their fractal dimension at @xmath83 or @xmath21 .",
    "additionally , we introduce a correction to the well - established ghtm mean - field approximation , that leads to a solution capable to quantitatively reproduce with remarkable precision previous well - established observations . in summary , we present here , for the first time , a comprehensive discussion on the dynamical origin of the fractality and , with this , the basis for the understanding its subjacent algebra originated in these far - from - equilibrium transitions as an emergent feature of the anisotropy effects .",
    "these results represent an important unifying step towards a complete theory of growth , and they might provide important insights to understand pattern formation phenomena in many related areas of research @xcite .",
    "in all simulations , each particle has a diameter equal to one .",
    "this is the basic unit of distance for the system . for aggregates based on ba or mf ( fig .",
    "1a and 1c ) , we follow a standard procedure in which particles are launched at random from the circumference of radius @xmath122 , with equal probability in position and direction of motion . here , @xmath123 is the distance of the farthest particle in the cluster with respect to the seed particle placed at the origin . in our simulations we used @xmath124 particle diameters to avoid undesirable screening effects . in particular , for the mf model , particles always aggregate to the closest particle in the cluster , this is determined by the projected position of the aggregated particles along the direction of motion of the incoming particle ( see fig .",
    "1c ) . in the case of aggregates based on dla ( fig .",
    "1b ) , particles were launched from a circumference of radius @xmath125 , with @xmath126 .",
    "the mean free path of the particles is set to one particle diameter .",
    "we also used a standard scheme that modifies the mean free path of the particles as they wander at a distance larger than @xmath23 or in - between branches , and set a killing radius at @xmath127 , in order to speed up the aggregation process .    on the other hand , in order to mix different aggregation dynamics , an aggregation scheme is selected with probability @xmath30 while the other with probability @xmath128 , as explained before .",
    "the evaluation of the aggregation scheme to be used is only updated once a particle has been successfully aggregated to the cluster under such dynamics .      in all measurements",
    ", we used @xmath129 clusters containing @xmath130 particles .",
    "the fractal dimension is measured from the two - point density correlation function , @xmath131 , where the double bracket indicates an average over all possible origins @xmath132 and all possible orientations . here , it is assumed that @xmath133 , where the fractal dimension is given by @xmath134 where @xmath4 is the dimension of the embedding space .",
    "we also used the radius of gyration given by @xmath135 , where @xmath59 is the number of particles , @xmath136 is the position of the @xmath137-particle in the cluster , and , @xmath138 is the position of the center of mass . here , it is assumed that @xmath139 , where the fractal dimension is given by @xmath140 . therefore , the fractal dimensions , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , are obtained from linear - fits to the corresponding functions , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , in log - log plots . in practice",
