    "blue straggler stars ( bss ) where first observed in the 1950 s ( @xcite ) in the galactic globular cluster ( ggc ) m3 . in the color - magnitude diagram they formed a sparsely populated sequence extending to higher luminosities than the turn - off point of normal hydrogen burning main - sequence stars .",
    "superficially they looked like a population of younger stars , more massive than the turn - off stars , in an old star cluster . since there is no other indication of star formation after the burst which formed the bulk of the cluster stars ,",
    "two mechanisms for making bss are favored .",
    "first is the merger of two stars in a primordial binary system , where `` primordial '' refers to binaries formed when the cluster formed .",
    "second are collisions in regions of very high stellar density ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these collisional - bss include several classes of objects : direct collisions producing a more massive star ; collisions which harden primordial binaries until the point of merger ; and binaries produced in collisions which later merge .",
    "the dense cores of globular clusters were obvious targets for observations required to refine our understanding of bss .",
    "indeed , more than 20 years ago hills & day ( 1976 ) suggested searching the core of m80 for collisional bss .",
    "however , only with the advent of the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) could such observations be made ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the bss population , especially collisional - bss , can serve as a diagnostic for the dynamical evolution of ggcs . because of gravitational interactions between cluster stars , ggcs evolve dynamically on time scales generally smaller than their ages .",
    "for example , the first manifestation of dynamical process within a ggc is that in the inner part of a ggc more massive stars ( or binaries ) should settle toward the center . beyond this",
    ", more dramatic dynamical phases can happen during the cluster s lifetime .",
    "stars with velocities above the escape velocity continuously evaporate , and phenomena such as galactic tidal stripping remove stars from the outer regions of the cluster and induce substantial changes in the structure of the cluster itself . as a ggc adjusts to the loss of stars , the cluster core must contract . under some circumstances",
    "this process can run away leading to a possibly catastrophic `` core - collapse . '' about 15% of the ggc population show evidence for this phenomenon .",
    "binaries are thought to play a fundamental role in the core collapse : binary - binary collisions could in fact be effective in halting ( or , more probably , delaying ) the collapse of the core avoiding infinite central density .",
    "this time of enhanced binary interactions as the cluster fights off core collapse could well correspond to a period of unusually large bss production . by the end of this phase",
    "most of the binaries in the core will be destroyed by close encounters ; the survivors will become highly hardened ( i.e. , tightly bound ) , producing most of the additional collisional - bss .",
    "to search for bss ( and other blue objects ) we have used the _ wide field planetary camera _ ( wfpc2 ) of _ hst _  to obtain ultraviolet and visible images of the central region of the high density cluster m80 ( ngc  6093 ) . both the high angular resolution and uv sensitivity of _ hst",
    "_  are essential to identify these uv - bright objects among the much more luminous red giants in the cluster ( @xcite ) .",
    "the images were obtained on 56 april 1996 ( go-5903 , pi : f.r .",
    "ferraro ) with the wfpc2 f160bw ( far - uv ) , f255w ( mid - uv ) , f336w ( @xmath0 ) , and f555w ( visible or @xmath1 ) filters .",
    "the planetary camera ( pc , which has the highest resolution @xmath2 ) was roughly centered on the cluster center while the wide field ( wf ) cameras ( at lower resolution @xmath3 ) sampled the surrounding outer regions .",
    "the bss identifications are based on @xmath4s exposures in @xmath0 and @xmath5s exposures in f255w .",
    "the wfpc2 frames were processed through the standard hst - wfpc pipeline and photometry was obtained as outlined in our study of bss in m3 ( @xcite ) . figure  [ image ] shows the advantages of using uv images to search for bss : in the center of the @xmath1 image the light from the bright red giant branch ( rgb ) stars blends together . in the uv image",
    "the brightest objects are horizontal branch ( hb ) stars and bss ; there is little blending even at the center .",
    "the ultraviolet color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) in the ( @xmath6 ) plane for more than 13,000 stars identified in the hst field of view , is presented in figure  [ uvcmd ] .",
    "the large population of bss defines a narrow nearly - vertical sequence spanning @xmath7 mag in @xmath8 .",
    "they are clearly separable from the cooler and fainter turn - off and subgiant branch ( sgb ) stars . however , as already discussed in previous papers ( see @xcite ) one of the major problem in defining homogeneous samples of bss is the _ operative _ definition of the faint edge of the bss population .",
    "this is true even in uv - cmds ( see for example @xcite ) , since generally the bss sequence merges smoothly into the @xmath9 region without showing any gap or discontinuity . in selecting the bss sample here",
    "we have adopted the same criteria we used in m3 , which was recently observed ( @xcite ) with the same technique and set - up used here . in order to assure the same bss limiting absolute magnitude for m80",
    "as we adopted in m3 , we aligned the two @xmath10 cmds , using the bright portion of the hb as _ normalization _ region .",
    "the shift in magnitude required to align the two cmds is @xmath11 .",
    "the resulting fainter boundary of the bss sequence in m80 is @xmath12 .",
    "adopting this figure m80 turns to have a spectacularly large population of bss305 candidates have been found in the wfpc2 field of view .",
    "ferraro et  al .  ( 1997a ) split the m3 bss into _ bright _ and _ faint _ subsamples .",
    "the analogous division in m80 is at @xmath13 .",
    "m80 has ( 1 ) 129 bright bss with @xmath14 and ( 2 ) 176 faint bss with @xmath15 .",
    "the bss region in the cmd is better shown in panel ( b ) of figure  [ uvcmd ] where the total sample of bss is plotted as big dots .",
    "note that the limiting magnitude for the faint bss is at the `` error envelope '' of the main sequence region on the cmd . by examining the adjacent regions of the cmd we estimate that there at most a few ms stars misidentified as bss .",
    "in addition the faint bss and bright bss have almost identical radial distributions while that of the ms stars is much less centrally concentrated , similar to that of the rgb+hb stars ( see fig .",
    "[ cumdist ] below ) .",
    "this again suggests at most a very minor contamination of the faint bss sample .",
    "table 1 lists the bss candidates : the first column is the number , then in columns 25 we report the identification number , @xmath8 and @xmath0 magnitudes and the coordinates @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the coordinates are referred to an arbitrary system and are expressed in _ ground - based _ pixel units ( 1 pixel @xmath17 ) , after a rotation and translation to match the complementary ground - based observations ( see below ) .    while not obvious from figure  [ image ] , figure 3 clearly shows that the bss ( heavy solid line ) are far more concentrated towards the cluster center than either the hb or rgb stars .",
    "( the dashed line shows the combined distribution of the hb+rgb which are individually quite similar ) .",
    "half of the bss population is within @xmath18 from the cluster center , compared to only @xmath19 of the hb or rgb in the same region .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov test applied to the two distributions shows that the probability of drawing the two populations from the same distribution is very small , @xmath20 .",
    "this result is consistent with the scenario that bss are much more massive population than normal hb , rgb stars .",
    "a recent direct spectroscopic mass measured for a bss in the core of the ggc 47  tuc ( @xcite ) also indicates a higher mass for that star .",
    "extensive _ artificial star _",
    "tests have been performed to estimate the degree of completeness of the detected bss population .",
    "the completeness level is @xmath21 at the faint edge of the bright sample and @xmath22 at the faintest magnitude limit . from these results we estimate that the _ true _ number of bss in m80 could be as large as @xmath23 .",
    "the number of bss in m80 is huge .",
    "the previous record number was in m3 which has a population of @xmath24 bss ( about half of the population in m80 ) in the wfpc2 field of view ( @xcite ) .",
    "a quantitative comparison requires that the bss number be normalized to account for the size of the total population .",
    "this is done with an appropriate specific frequency :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the number of bss and @xmath27 is the number of hb stars in the same area . this ratio can be easily computed in the uv - cmds since the hb population is quite bright and the sequence well defined .",
    "the specific frequency of bss in m80 turns to be @xmath28 .",
    "in other clusters with similar mass , m3 , m13 and m92 , which have been observed with similar technique by our group we find substantially lower values ranging from @xmath29 for m13 up to 0.55 and @xmath30 for m92 and m3 .",
    "moreover , considering only the field of view of the pc , the specific frequency of bss in m80 rises to @xmath31 , i.e. , the bss are almost twice as abundant as the hb stars .",
    "several other clusters have recently been surveyed with the wfpc2 covering a region comparable with that of our observations .",
    "the somewhat less massive cluster m30 has a population of 48 bss and a specific frequency @xmath32 ( @xcite ) . while not optimal for bss searches , the survey of sosin et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) can give a rough indication of the central bss population .",
    "the clusters with the largest bss population are ngc  6388 and ngc  2808 each with @xmath33 bss .",
    "these clusters are each about a factor 4 more massive than m80 but still contain only a fraction ( @xmath34 ) of the bss population found in m80 .",
    "the corresponding specific frequencies of bss would be about 0.1 that of m80 . either in terms of number or specific frequency m80",
    "becomes the galactic bss record holder .",
    "one might speculate that the bss in m80 are produced by an anomalously large population of primordial binaries .",
    "if so , some of these binaries should be detectable outside the cluster core in the form primordial - binary - merger bss , such as those found in the outer region of m3 ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , recent cmds of the outer parts of m80 ( @xcite ) give no indication for a large _ primeval _ population comparable to that found in m3 . given this we turn to the structural characteristics of m80 for an explanation .",
    "m80 is much more centrally condensed than m3 , m92 , and m13 , a factor that might promote the production of collisional - bss .",
    "can that factor alone account for the bss population ?",
    "we suspect not , because the bss population in m80 is also large compared with other clusters with high central density .",
    "for example , the central part of 47  tuc @xmath35 compared to @xmath36 for m80 and in contrast to @xmath37 for m3 ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure 1 of sosin et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) shows that 47 tuc does not have a large population of bss  no more than 50 bss can be counted .",
    "likewise , ngc  2808 and ngc  6388 have densities of @xmath38 respectively and relatively modest bss populations .",
    "since high density can not account for the large number of bss in m80 perhaps they arise from its dynamical state .",
    "m80 has one of the highest central densities ( @xmath39 ) of any ggc which has shown no previous evidence for having undergone core collapse ( @xcite ) .",
    "generally ggcs are considered core - collapsed or not depending on how well their radial distribution of stars is fit by king models ( @xcite ) .",
    "these models are characterized by two parameters , the core radius , @xmath40 , and the tidal radius , @xmath41 , or , alternatively , the concentration , @xmath42 .",
    "our data supplemented with ground - based observations ( @xcite ) for @xmath43 provides the best such test to date for m80 .    to determine @xmath40 and @xmath44 we first determined the gravity center @xmath45 following the procedure of montegriffo et  al .",
    "we computed @xmath45 by simply averaging the @xmath46 and @xmath47 coordinates ( in the local system ) of stars lying in the pc camera , and then transforming them to the absolute system .",
    "@xmath45 is located at pixel @xmath48 in our pc image ; this corresponds to : @xmath49 which is @xmath50 nw of the center reported in the djorgovski ( 1993 ) compilation .",
    "the @xmath45 is at pixel @xmath51 in the ground - based coordinate system used in table  1 .",
    "the density profile with respect to the measured gravity center @xmath45 is shown in figure  [ kingmods ] .",
    "it was derived using the standard technique ( @xcite ) for all stars with @xmath52 . a king model with the most recent values ( @xcite ) , @xmath53 and @xmath54 ,",
    "does not reproduce the observed density profile for @xmath55 , however a king model with a smaller @xmath56 and essentially the same @xmath57 fits the data reasonably well as seen in figure  [ kingmods ] .",
    "meylan & heggie ( 1997 ) warn that it can be difficult to differentiate the dynamical ( pre- in- or post - collapse ) phase of a gc on the basis of the shape of the density profile .",
    "however , they suggest , as a rule of thumb , that _ `` any gc with a concentration @xmath58 may be considered as collapsed or on the verge of collapsing or just beyond . '' _ thus , while the good fit to the king model suggests that m80 has not yet completed core - collapse , the value of @xmath44 is consistent with the suggestion that m80 is on the verge of collapse . the other piece of information we can bring to bear is the anomalously large bss population .",
    "two pcc clusters have been observed deep enough and with appropriate filters that we have a reasonable estimate of their central bss populations .",
    "neither of these , 47  tuc ( @xcite ) and m30 ( @xcite ) , has a bss frequency close to that of m80 .",
    "thus we see that being in a pcc state can not explain the bss population of m80 .",
    "the most plausible hypothesis at this point is that the bss arise from the core collapse process .",
    "it is commonly thought that binaries play an important role on the core collapse ( @xcite ) with the formation of binaries delaying and eventually halting the collapse . with its high central density m80 is probably trying very hard to undergo core collapse but binaries are forming and preventing this from happening .",
    "a large population of collision - bss should exist during this time and slightly beyond ( until the bss begin to die off ) .",
    "this scenario is fully compatible with dynamical evolution times : following meylan & heggie ( 1997 ) , without including binary formation the entire evolution time ( @xmath59 ) of the core is @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the initial half mass relaxation time .",
    "using values from djorgovski ( 1993 ) , we obtain for m80 @xmath62 , which is 30 times smaller than the cluster s age .",
    "with such a large population of bss we might expect to find a significant population of evolved bss ( e - bss ) .",
    "renzini & fusi pecci ( 1988 ) suggested searching for e - bss during their core helium burning phase since they should appear to be redder and brighter than _ normal _ hb stars . following this prescription fusi pecci et al .",
    "( 1992 ) identified a few e - bss candidates in several clusters with predominantly blue hbs where the likelihood of confusing e - bss stars with true hb or evolved hb stars was minimized . because of the small numbers there always the possibility that some or even most of these candidate e - bss were due to field contamination .",
    "near cluster centers field contamination should be less of a problem . in our _ hst",
    "_  study of m3 we identified a sample of e - bss candidates ( see ferraro et al 1997 ) and argued that the radial distribution of e - bss was similar to that of the bss . m80 offers some advantages over m3 in searching for e - bss : 1 ) it has a very blue hb so there should be less confusion between red hb stars and e - bss ; 2 ) it has a larger number of bss ; 3 ) we have identical photometry for m13 which has a very similar bhb to m80 coupled with a much smaller number of bss  the e - bss region of the cmd of m80 should have a substantially larger number of stars than that of m13 . in figure 3a",
    "we show a zoomed @xmath63 cmd of the hb region .",
    "the expected location for e - bss has been indicated as a box ; 19 e - bss ( plotted as large filled circles ) lie in the box .",
    "there are only 5 e - bss in the same part of the cmd of m13 . @xmath1 and @xmath0",
    "magnitudes and position for the e - bss found in m80 are listed in table 2 .    in the case of m80",
    "it is very unlikely that the e - bss population is due to background field contamination .",
    "in fact , most ( 15 ) of the e - bss have been found in the pc field of view , while only 4 e - bss lie in the most external wfs .",
    "a estimate of the expected field contamination can be computed adopting the star counts listed by ratnatunga & bahcall ( 1985 ) .",
    "following their model , @xmath64 star per square arcmin is expected in a section of the cmd which is _ twice _ the size of the region used to isolate the e - bss population .",
    "( the e - bss span less than 1 magnitude in @xmath1 , while the ratnatunga & bahcall ( 1985 ) counts are listed for 2 mag - wide bins . )",
    "the expected number of field stars is 0 in the pc field of view and 1.6 stars in the global field of view of the three wf cameras .",
    "for this reason we can reasonably conclude that the region of the cmd used to select e - bss candidate is essentially unaffected by field contamination .",
    "the cumulative radial distribution of the e - bss stars is shown ( as dotted line ) in figure 3 .",
    "the e - bss cumulative distribution is quite similar to the bss distribution and significantly different from that of the hb - rgb .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test shows that the probability that the e - bss and bss population has been extracted from the same distribution is @xmath65 while the probability that the e - bss and the rgb - hb population have the same distribution is only @xmath66 . this result confirms the expectation that the e - bss share the same distribution of the bss and they are both a more massive population than the bulk of the cluster stars .",
    "it further strengthens the case that field contamination is negligible .",
    "earlier studies ( @xcite ) have suggested that the ratio of bright bss ( b - bss ) to e - bss is @xmath67 . for m80",
    "the number of b - bss ( defined as in @xcite ) is @xmath68 , and we find @xmath69 fully consistent with earlier studies . because both our bss and e - bss samples are so cleanly defined the ratio of the total number of bss to e - bss , @xmath70 , should be useful in testing lifetimes of bss models .",
    "the emerging scenario for bss is complex .",
    "all ggcs which have been properly surveyed have some bss , so bss must be considered as a normal component of ggc population .",
    "bss are found in diverse environments and are probably formed by both merging primordial binaries and stellar collisions .",
    "some intermediate - low density clusters have only a few bss ( m13 ) while similar clusters ( m3 , m92 ) have many more .",
    "this may arise from the fact that the initial population of binaries in clusters like m13 is small .",
    "the relatively large population of bss in the exterior of m3 ( @xcite ) in contrast to the absence of bss in the exterior of m13 ( @xcite ) supports the notion of very different primordial binary populations .",
    "the densest cluster cores have significant but highly variable bss populations ( see the discussion in ferraro , bellazzini & fusi pecci 1995 ) .",
    "in particular the post - core - collapse clusters 47  tuc and m30 have significantly smaller bss populations than m80 .",
    "we suggest that exceptional population in m80 arises because we have caught a cluster at a critical phase in its dynamical evolution .",
    "this effect could be enhanced by a large fraction of primordial binaries , but there is no indication for this in the form a large bss population in the outer cluster ( @xcite ) .",
    "more information is needed before a definitive conclusion can be reached . a search for other indications of a high frequency of stellar multiplicity in m80 , such as a broadening of the main sequence",
    ", would also be very useful .",
    "also , further study of the velocity distribution would be important to clarify the dynamical state of the cluster ( @xcite ) .",
    "core collapse is one of the most spectacular phenomena in nature .",
    "it is important to confirm whether we have caught m80 during the period when the stellar interactions are delaying the collapse of the core ( and producing bss ) .",

    "<S> using _ hst - wfpc2 _ observations in two ultraviolet ( uv ) filters ( f225w and f336w ) of the central region of the high density galactic globular cluster ( ggc ) m80 we have identified 305 blue straggler stars ( bss ) which represents the largest and most concentrated population of bss ever observed in a ggc . </S>",
    "<S> we also identify the largest , clean sample of evolved bss yet found . </S>",
    "<S> the high stellar density alone can not explain the bss , and we suggest that in m80 we are witnessing a transient dynamical state , during which stellar interactions are delaying the core - collapse process leading to an exceptionally large population of _ collisional_-bss .    # 1*#1 * # 1 # 1 et al . </S>"
