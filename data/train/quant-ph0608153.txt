    "a basic feature of classical information is that it can be copied and distributed to an unlimited number of users .",
    "however , as one considers quantum information the fundamental task of broadcasting for pure states is impossible , and this implies severe limitations to very useful purposes such as parallel computation , networked communications , and secret sharing .",
    "a perfect distribution of the information encoded into @xmath0 input systems equally prepared in a pure state to @xmath1 users would correspond to the so called _ quantum cloning _",
    ", which is forbidden by the laws of quantum mechanics @xcite . nevertheless , the case of mixed input states is different , since one needs only the local state of each final user to be equal to the input state , whereas the global output state is allowed to be correlated .",
    "this fact opens the possibility to generalize the idea of cloning to quantum maps that output correlated states such as their local reduced states are copies of the input .",
    "this generalized version of quantum cloning was named _ quantum broadcasting _ in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this work",
    "the impossibility of perfect broadcasting was proved in the case of a single input copy whenever the set of states to be broadcast contains a pair of noncommuting density matrices .",
    "this proof was later often considered as the mixed states - scenario extension of the no - cloning theorem .",
    "however , it was recently shown that even noncommuting quantum states can be perfectly broadcast provided a suitable number of input copies is available @xcite . moreover ,",
    "a new phenomenon can occur , which was named _",
    "superbroadcasting _ : for @xmath0 two - level systems ( qubits ) , equally prepared in an unknown mixed input state , the information contained in the direction of the bloch vector can be distributed to @xmath1 users and the local state of each final user can be more pure than the initial copies .",
    "an intuitive explanation of the superbroadcasting effect is provided by the statement that superbroadcasting shifts the noise from local purities to global correlations  @xcite .",
    "one of the issues of superbroadcasting is then a deeper understanding of the role of correlations of different nature . while there are correlations which improve the accessibility of information encoded in multiple systems  @xcite , the case of superbroadcasting points out that other kind of correlations are in fact detrimental in this respect .",
    "this leads to an amount of information in the global output state that is lower than the sum of informations contained in the local reduced states , i.  e. the total information in absence of correlations .",
    "natural questions then arise at this stage .",
    "are the correlations among the final users solely quantum , or is it possible to purify the local states by introducing just classical correlations ? moreover , in the optimal broadcasting protocol , the distribution of information is achieved by coherently manipulating input systems , and the true direction of the bloch vector remains unknown during the whole procedure .",
    "what happens if one first uses the @xmath0 input copies to estimate the direction of the bloch vector , and then distributes @xmath3 pure states pointing in the estimated direction ?",
    "is it still possible , on average , to increase the purity of local states ?",
    "a preliminary extensive analysis of bipartite correlations at the output of superbroadcasting maps suggests that no bipartite entanglement is present  @xcite , whereas the analysis of multipartite entanglement is still an open problem .",
    "the fact that the practical protocol for achieving superbroadcasting involves pure state cloning  @xcite suggests on the other hand that the output state contains quantum correlations coming from the structure of the tensor product hilbert space and its symmetric subspace .    in this paper , we will consider a semiclassical procedure for broadcasting , which consists of measurement and subsequent repreparation of the quantum states , usually referred to as the _ measure - and - prepare _ scheme .",
    "we call this scheme semiclassical because broadcasting occurs via extraction and processing of classical information , though the information is retrieved by a collective measurement which might be strictly quantum , being generally a nonlocal measurement .",
    "we show that the phenomenon of superbroadcasting can still be observed in this case , even though the scaling factors obtained by this scheme are suboptimal .",
    "such a procedure introduces only classical correlations among the final copies , as the joint output state remains fully separable .",
    "the remarkable presence of superbroadcasting even in the semiclassical scenario can be explained as a change of encoding of the classical information about the direction of the bloch vector .",
    "in fact , the tensor product of @xmath0 identical qubit states provides an encoding of direction , in which the information is spread in a nonlocal way over the whole @xmath0-qubits system . in order to extract such an information",
    ", one needs either a collective measurement or a statistical processing of single - qubit measurements .",
    "however , after the information has been extracted , it can be redistributed exploiting a new encoding , which is more favourable to single users .",
    "this result can be interpreted as a proof that on one hand optimal superbroadcasting involves quantum effects that can not be simulated by extracting and re - using classical information , and on the other hand the phenomenon of superbroadcasting itself is improved by entanglement but not necessarily due to it .",
    "moreover , we will show that the fidelity of the optimal estimation of direction coincides with the fidelity of the optimal superbroadcasting protocol in the limit @xmath4 .",
    "this provides the first example of generalization to arbitrary mixed states of the relation between cloning and state estimation , which was known in the literature for pure states @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will also address the optimal approximation of a _ universal not broadcasting _",
    ", namely the impossible transformation which corresponds to a combination of ideal purification , quantum cloning , and spin flip ( universal not ) .",
    "we will derive the optimal physical map , observing how in this case the semiclassical procedure achieves the optimal fidelity .",
    "in other words , the optimal universal not broadcasting can be viewed as a purely classical processing of information , as it happens in the case of pure input states  @xcite .",

    "clearly , in the classical procedure both broadcasting and not broadcasting have the _",
    "same fidelity_. due to the invariance property ( [ invprob ] ) , the fidelity does not depend on the actual value of the direction @xmath29 , and it is enough to maximize it for a fixed direction , for example the positive direction @xmath109 of the @xmath110-axis . for this reason , from now on we will denote the fidelity simply with @xmath111 .",

    "now we want to investigate whether the phenomenon of superbroadcasting takes place in the classical broadcasting procedure .",
    "to do this we consider the bloch vector of the local output state , by writing @xmath128 the first observation is that the direction @xmath129 of the output state is the same as the direction @xmath29 of the input state @xmath29 .",
    "due to covariance , it is enough to prove this fact for @xmath29 pointing in the @xmath110-direction . in order to prove it ,",
    "suppose that @xmath130 , then we would have @xmath131 namely the fidelity of the output state with @xmath132 would be higher than the fidelity with @xmath133 ( the equality holds only if the output state is maximally mixed ) . since we can write @xmath134 for some suitable rotation @xmath135 , in that case we could replace the optimal povm @xmath101 with a new povm @xmath136 , where @xmath137 denotes the inverse rotation of @xmath100 . in this way",
    "the fidelity associated to the new povm would be @xmath138 , in contradiction to the fact that @xmath101 is the optimal povm .",
    "therefore , for the optimal povm the bloch vector of the output state _ must _ point in the same direction as the bloch vector of the input state .",

    "the plot of this expression demonstrates the presence of superbroadcasting for @xmath144 : in this case the length of the bloch vector of each single - user state is increased after the broadcasting map . in other words ,",
    "the classical broadcasting procedure allows to distribute to many users the information about the direction of the input bloch vector , and , at the same time , to increase the purity of the final local states .",
    "this proves that superbroadcasting can be achieved with a classical procedure , by first extracting the classical information about the bloch vector direction , and then distributing this information among the final users .",
    "the increase in the length of the bloch vector at each site corresponds to an encoding of information which is more favourable to each single user .",
    "moreover , the expression  ( [ finallenght ] ) can be compared with the corresponding one for the optimal universal superbroadcasting  @xcite , where the information about the direction is not extracted from the input states , but coherently manipulated and distributed .",
    "remarkably , in the asymptotic limit of a large number @xmath3 of output copies , the two expressions coincide , namely the optimal distribution of information is achieved asymptotically by the classical broadcasting procedure .",
    "this result provides the generalization to mixed states of the well known relation between cloning and state estimation  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , a set of @xmath0 qubits , equally prepared in the state @xmath145 , can be viewed as an encoding of the classical information about the direction @xmath29 .",
    "suppose now that we want to distribute such an information to @xmath1 users , and , at the same time , change the encoding by flipping the direction of the bloch vector .",
    "in other words , we are interested in the best approximation of the impossible transformation @xmath146 for pure states , and for @xmath147 , this transformation coincides with the universal not gate , which flips the spin of a qubit for any possible direction  @xcite . in general",

    "moreover , as for the case of cloning , also in the case of superbroadcasting the figure of merit is the fidelity of the output state with a _ pure _ state  the eigenvector of the input density operator corresponding to the maximal eigenvalue ( see eq .",
    "( [ fid ] ) for the universal , and eq .",
    "( [ fidphase ] ) for the phase covariant case ) .",
    "it is then clear that asymptotically the fidelity of the optimal universal ( phase covariant ) superbroadcasting coincides with that of the optimal estimation of direction ( phase ) . in general",
    ", the above reasoning shows that superbroadcasting with infinite users is equivalent to the estimation of the eigenstate corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the input density matrix .",
    "this result generalizes the well - known relation between cloning and state estimation to the case of mixed states .",
    "in this paper we considered the problem of quantum broadcasting , and in particular we analysed the possibility of broadcasting @xmath0 input qubit states to @xmath3 output qubits with the same bloch vector direction , just by estimating the direction by a collective measurement on the input qubits and then preparing @xmath3 outputs correspondingly .",
    "the main result is that this strategy allows to achieve superbroadcasting , namely to have output copies which are even more pure than the input ones , at the expense of classical correlations in the global output state .",
    "this superbroadcasting is suboptimal , but asymptotically converges to the optimal one , confirming also in the case of mixed states the fact that state estimation and cloning are asymptotically equivalent .",
    "we first considered the universal broadcasting , and then the broadcasting of the antipodal state , the so called universal not . for this purpose",
    ", we proved that the semiclassical strategy is optimal .",
    "finally , we considered the phase covariant version of the broadcasting problem , showing that superbroadcasting occurs with suboptimal purification rate , which is still better than the one for universal semiclassical superbroadcasting .",
    "the main interest of the summarized results is twofold . on one hand ,",
    "our results prove that superbroadcasting can be achieved by a semiclassical procedure , and then coherent manipulation of quantum information is not necessary , even though optimal superbroadcasting requires it . on the other hand",
    ", the practical interest of our results is that the semiclassical rates exhibit a good approximation of the optimal rates , and can be more easily achieved experimentally .",
