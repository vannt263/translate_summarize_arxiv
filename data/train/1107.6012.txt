    ", this divergence appears to be consistent with standard site percolation @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the divergence occurs even at @xmath18 if @xmath12 is below a critical value @xcite .",

    "consider a directed graph with @xmath20 vertices , and edges @xmath21 furnished with weights @xmath22 .",
    "the minimum @xmath23 cut is given by a subset of the edges of the graph , whose removal disconnects vertices @xmath24 and @xmath25 , such that the sum of the weights of the cut edges is minimal . using the variables @xmath26 , which are 1",
    "if vertex @xmath27 is connected to @xmath24 and 0 otherwise , the total weight of a cut can be represented as @xmath28 with the identification of @xmath26 with spin variables ( excepting the vertices @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) , and an appropriate choice of the weights @xmath22 , this function can be made to precisely match the rfim hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "the minimum cut separating the graph into vertices connected to @xmath24 and vertices connected to @xmath25 gives the minimum - energy way of cutting the rfim lattice into clusters of up and down spins , and thus corresponds to the ground state of equation [ eq : hamiltonian ] .",

    ", we use a fast algorithm for solving the minimum cut problem based on the idea of `` augmenting paths''@xcite . the worst case scenario for the running time of this algorithm",
    "is an unimpressive @xmath35 ( or more generally @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the number of vertices and @xmath38 is the number of edges ) , however , the algorithm was designed to optimize the typical case .",

    "schramm - loewner evolutions are defined in terms of a family @xmath40 of conformal maps which take , formally , the upper half plane minus the curve @xmath41 ( parametrized by `` time '' @xmath25 ) to the upper half plane , @xmath42 .",

    "numerically , rather than solving the differential equation , the map @xmath48 is instead pictured as a series of maps @xmath49 which iteratively remove a small section from the beginning of the curve . to calculate the driving function from a given curve",
    ", the incremental map @xmath49 is approximated using a vertical slit map @xcite @xmath50 the parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 are determined from the coordinates of the curve segment to be removed through the relations @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "more specifically , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the coordinates of the @xmath27th segment of the curve after undergoing the @xmath57 successive maps @xmath58 .",
    "the parameter @xmath51 is the value of the driving function @xmath44 sampled at time @xmath59 .",
    "the complex square root in equation [ eqn : slit_map ] is calculated , as usual , with the branch cut along the negative real axis .",
    "this is an iterative process in which the coordinates of the interface are successively updated for each step , and thus the computational complexity is @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the length of the interface .",

    "if the driving function @xmath44 can be shown to be brownian motion then the curves satisfy sle@xmath3 . in practice ,",

    "each spin is determined solely by the independent random variable @xmath10 . identifying spin up with `` site occupation '' ,",
    "the site occupation probability @xmath75 is simply the probability for @xmath10 to be positive : @xmath76 . for smaller disorder",
    "the spin - spin interaction of the rfim complicates the analogy with percolation .",
    "however , it has been demonstrated that there exists a line of critical external fields @xmath77 , as pictured schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : hc ] , for which observables like the crossing probability and the fractal dimension of the spin clusters maintain the percolation values @xcite .    for very large disorder",
    "the line of critical external fields is found from the critical site percolation probability @xmath78 ( @xmath79 for the square lattice ) @xmath80 for small disorder the behavior is less well understood .",
    "@xmath77 decreases as @xmath12 decreases , approaching the limiting value @xmath81 .",
    "it has been claimed @xcite that at a finite disorder strength , @xmath82 , the curve becomes identically zero @xmath83 , cf .",
    "[ fig : hc ] .",
    "we tested this claim by looking at the behavior of the system varying @xmath12 at @xmath18 .",
    "we calculated the probability that a connected cluster of up spins crosses a rectangle of aspect ratio @xmath84 in the vertical ( shorter ) direction ( this aspect ratio is chosen to be different from @xmath85 , but the specific value is somewhat arbitrary ) . in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : h_dep ] , we present the results of these calculations .",
    "the crossing probability @xmath86 for large @xmath12 is zero ( as expected for a square lattice with @xmath87 ) .",
    "as the disorder is decreased , @xmath86 approaches the exact percolation value , which is indicated by the horizontal line in the plot . at very small disorder ,",
    "when the breakup length scale @xmath16 becomes comparable to the system size @xmath88 , the system appears ferromagnetic and the crossing probability falls away from the plateau value .    to separate the approach to the plateau from the finite size effects we also considered another quantity , the probability @xmath89 that there exists a connected cluster of either up or down spins crossing either horizontally or vertically .",
    "the small disorder limit of this quantity is @xmath90 for both the onset of percolation and the ultimate ferromagnetic ( and finite size ) ordering .",
    "if there is a percolation transition at finite disorder ( @xmath91 ) , in the thermodynamic limit @xmath92 the curve @xmath93 will be a step function .",
    "hence , the curves for finite systems approaching this step function will intersect at @xmath94 . as is apparent from our data for @xmath89 shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : h_dep ] , such a crossing is not observed at least down to @xmath95 , significantly below the previously conjectured value of @xmath96 .",
    "the study of even smaller disorder strengths , while ensuring @xmath97 , is preempted by the exponential growth of the breakup length @xmath16 .",
    "although it seems very unlikely that the system undergoes a true percolation phase transition for @xmath18 , there exists a large plateau region in which the system appears to be at critical percolation at @xmath18 , even up to very large system sizes .",
    "presumably , this holds true even for system sizes occurring in experimental realizations of the rfim .",
    "finally , we tested directly the conformal mapping upon which sle is based .",
    "we studied the statistics of @xmath98 interfaces generated in a half disc .",
    "this geometry is used to optimally mimic the full half plane .",
    "the interface is initiated at the origin ( the center of the flat edge ) by two fixed spins and is considered ended when it touches the curved boundary .",
    "we find that the variance of the driving function calculated from the interfaces using the method described in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] is @xmath99 , and the normalized mean is @xmath100 .",
    "the agreement with sle is good , but is only expected to be perfect at criticality .",
    "the difference from the expected percolation value @xmath1 which is perhaps just visible here is due to the calculations being carried out at @xmath72 .",
    "the position distribution of the resulting stochastic process at several fixed times is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : slehist ] along with curves representing the expectations for a perfect random walk .",
    "we have focused here on the case of zero external field , where we have shown , using significantly larger system sizes than had been accessible before , that there is no percolation phase transition for @xmath18 , at least down to @xmath101 . due to the fact , however , that the percolation transition line comes exponentially close to @xmath18 for small random - field strengths @xmath12 ( cf.fig .  [ fig : hc ] ) , there exists a plateau region where even at @xmath18 the behavior appears nearly indistinguishable from criticality . in this regime",
    "we have tested the applicability of schramm - loewner evolution to the rfim and found good agreement .",
    "further studies at non - zero external field and using an array of further tests for consistency with sle confirm this result @xcite .",
