    "the studies of high - temperature superconductivity ( htsc ) in copper oxides remains one of the central topics of the condensed - matter physics . despite of the great effort of both experimentalist and theorists the nature of this phenomenon",
    "is still not fully understood .",
    "it is common belief that the basic difficulties here are due to quite unusual properties of these systems in the normal ( non - superconducting ) state , while without the explanation of these anomalies it is hard to expect the complete understanding of microscopic mechanism of htsc . in recent years",
    "one of the main directions in physics of htsc were the studies of the so called pseudogap state @xcite , which is observed in the region of the phase diagram , corresponding to current carrier concentrations less than the optimal concentration ( i.e. that corresponding to the maximal critical temperature of superconducting transition @xmath0 ) .",
    "this is usually called the `` underdoped '' region . in this region a number of anomalies of electronic properties is observed both in normal and superconducting states , which are interpreted as due to a drop of the density of single particle states and anisotropic renormalization of the spectral density of current carriers .",
    "understanding of the nature and properties of the pseudogap state remains the central problem in any approach towards explaining the complicated phase diagram of htsc - systems .",
    "this problem was already discussed in some hundreds of experimental and theoretical papers superconductivity conference in houston ( february 2000 ) four oral sessions were devoted to this problem  more than to any other problem in the field of htsc . ] .",
    "the aim of this review is to report basic experimental facts on the observation of the pseudogap state in underdoped htsc  cuprates , as well as the discussion of a number of simple theoretical models of this state .",
    "the review is not thorough , both in describing the experimental data and also in theoretical part .",
    "experiments are discussed rather briefly , taking into account the existence several good reviews @xcite .",
    "theoretical discussion is also rather incomplete and reflects mainly the personal position of the author .",
    "there exist two main theoretical scenarios for the explanation of pseudogap anomalies in htsc  systems .",
    "the first is based upon the model of cooper pairs formation already above the critical temperature of superconducting transition @xcite , with phase coherence appearing for @xmath1 .",
    "the second one assumes that the appearance of the pseudogap state is due to fluctuations of some short  range order of `` dielectric '' type which exist in the underdoped region of the phase diagram .",
    "most popular here is the picture of antiferromagnetic ( afm ) fluctuations @xcite , while the similar role of fluctuations of charge density waves ( cdw ) , structure or phase separation on microscopic scale can not be excluded .",
    "the author believes that some recent experiments strongly suggest that this second scenario is correct .",
    "accordingly , in theoretical part of this review we limit ourselves only to discussion of this kind of models with detailed enough explanation of the results obtained by the author and his collaborators , as well as some other authors whose works are somehow close to ours in main ideas and in approaches used .",
    "thus , we mainly assume the relevance of the model of antiferromagnetic fluctuations , though it is still can not be considered as fully confirmed .",
    "the references are also apparently incomplete , moreover these do not reflect any considerations of priority .",
    "it is assumed that the reader will find the additional references in papers cite here .",
    "the author expresses his excuses in advance to those numerous authors , whose papers are not cited here , mainly not to make the reference list too long .",
    "typical variants of the phase diagram of htsc  cuprates are shown in fig.[figpd ] .    depending on concentration of current carriers ( in most cases holes ) in highly conducting @xmath2 plane a number of phases",
    "is observed as well as regions with anomalous physical properties . for small concentration of holes",
    "all known htsc ",
    "cuprates are antiferromagnetic insulators . as hole concentration grows neel temperature @xmath3 drops rapidly from the values of the order of hundreds of @xmath4 , becoming zero at hole concentration @xmath5 of the order of @xmath6 or even less , while the system becomes metallic ( though this metal is rather bad ) . with the further growth of hole concentration",
    "the system becomes superconducting and superconducting critical temperature at first grows with hole concentration , becoming maximal at @xmath7 ( optimal doping ) , then drops to zero at @xmath8 , while in this ( overdoped ) region the metallic behavior persists .",
    "metallic properties in the region of @xmath9 are more or less traditional ( fermi - liquid ) , while for @xmath10 the system is a kind of anomalous metal , not described ( in the opinion of majority researchers ) by fermi - liquid theory .",
    "anomalies of physical properties which are attributed to the appearance of the pseudogap state are observed in metallic phase for @xmath10 and temperatures @xmath11 , where @xmath12 falls from temperatures of the order of @xmath3 for @xmath13 , becoming zero at some `` critical '' concentration @xmath14 , which is may be slightly larger than @xmath15 ( fig.[figpd](a ) ) , e.g. according to ref.@xcite this happens at @xmath16 . in the opinion of a number of authors ( mainly supporters of superconducting scenario of pseudogap formation )",
    "@xmath12 gradually approaches the line of superconducting @xmath0 close to the optimal concentration @xmath15 ( fig.[figpd](b ) ) .",
    "below we shall see that the majority of new experimental data apparently confirm the type of the phase diagram shown in fig.[figpd](a ) ( see details in ref .",
    "it should be stressed that temperature @xmath12 , in the opinion of majority of researchers , does not have the meaning of a temperature of some kind of phase transition .",
    "it only determines some characteristic temperature scale below which the pseudogap anomalies appear in different measurements .",
    "any kind of singularities of thermodynamic characteristics in this region of phase diagram are just absent . on the phase diagram",
    "was directly connected with some `` hidden '' symmetry breaking , strongly smeared by internal disorder . ]",
    "the general statement is that all these anomalies can be related to some drop ( in this region ) in the density of single  particle excitations close to the fermi level , which corresponds to a general concept of the pseudogap . in this case",
    "the value of @xmath12 is just proportional to energy width of the pseudogap .",
    "sometimes an additional temperature scale @xmath17 is also introduced , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figpd](b ) , attributed to a crossover from `` weak '' to `` strong '' pseudogap regime @xcite , usually referring to some change in spin system response in the vicinity of this temperature . in the following we shall not be dealing with these details",
    "now let us describe the most typical experimental signatures of pseudogap anomalies in htsc  cuprates .",
    "consider first the data on electronic specific heat of htsc  cuprates . in metals",
    "this contribution is usually represented as @xmath18 , so that in the normal state ( @xmath19 ) @xmath20 , where @xmath21  is the density of states at the fermi level . for @xmath22",
    "we have the well known anomaly due the second order transition and the value of @xmath23 acquires the characteristic peak ( `` jump '' or discontinuity ) . as an example in fig.[cybco ]",
    "we show some typical data obtained for @xmath24 with different values of @xmath25 @xcite .    in optimally doped and overdoped samples",
    "@xmath23 remains practically constant for all @xmath19 , while for underdoped samples a significant drop of @xmath23 is observed for temperatures @xmath26 .",
    "this observation directly signifies to the drop in the electronic density of states at the fermi level and formation of the pseudogap for @xmath11 .",
    "note also that the value of the `` jump '' of specific heat at @xmath0 is much reduced as we go into the underdoped region .",
    "more detailed analysis @xcite shows that the appropriate value of @xmath27 drops rather sharply , starting from the `` critical '' concentration of carriers @xmath28 , which is considered to be the point of appearance of the pseudogap in electronic spectrum .    using more or less traditional expressions of bcs theory ,",
    "specific heat data can be used to estimate the value of superconducting energy gap in electronic spectrum and its temperature dependence . in fig.[dct ] we show the data of ref.@xcite , obtained for @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "it is seen that thus defined energy gap does not go to zero for @xmath22 ( as it should be in a traditional superconductor ) and there is a significant `` tail '' in the region of higher temperatures .",
    "this effect is stronger for more underdoped samples .",
    "often these data are naively interpreted as signifying cooper pair formation at temperatures @xmath19 .",
    "pseudogap formation is clearly seen in the experiments on single particle tunneling . in a widely cited ref.@xcite tunneling measurements",
    "were performed on single crystals of @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) with different oxygen content . for underdoped samples",
    "the pseudogap formation in the density of states was clearly observed for temperatures higher than @xmath0 .",
    "this pseudogap smoothly evolved into superconducting gap for @xmath1 , which again was seen by many as a direct confirmation of superconducting nature of the pseudogap .",
    "some signs of pseudogap existence was observed in this work also for slightly overdoped samples .    while discussing tunneling experiments in htsc  cuprates , there is always a question of the surface quality of the samples .",
    "thus , especially interesting the recent studies of refs .",
    "@xcite , where an intrinsic tunneling was measured on the so called mesa  structures , specially formed ( by microlitography ) on the surface of the same system @xmath32 .",
    "these experiments clearly demonstrated the existence of superconducting gap approaching zero at @xmath22 on the background of smooth pseudogap , which exists at higher temperatures .",
    "the appropriate tunneling date are shown in fig.[tunn ] .",
    "typical peaks due to superconducting gap opening are seen on the background of smooth minimum in the density of states due to pseudogap .",
    "it is especially important that in ref.@xcite it was demonstrated that superconducting peculiarities of tunneling characteristics were destroyed by the external magnetic field , while the pseudogap remained practically independent of the field strength , which clearly shows its non  superconducting nature .",
    "appropriate data are shown in fig.[tunnh ]      formation of the pseudogap signals itself also in transport properties of htsc  systems in normal state , knight shift and nmr  relaxation .",
    "in particular it is thought to be a reason for the change of the standard ( for optimally doped samples ) linear temperature dependence of resistivity in the region of @xmath11 for underdoped samples .",
    "the value of the knight shift in underdoped samples becomes temperature dependent  for @xmath11 it drops rather rapidly .",
    "analogous behavior is observed in underdoped region for the value of @xmath33 , where @xmath34  is nmr relaxation time .",
    "let us remind that in usual metals the knight shift is proportional to @xmath21 , while @xmath35 ( korringa relation ) .",
    "resistivity @xmath36 is usually proportional to the scattering rate ( inverse mean  free time ) @xmath20 .",
    "thus , the notable suppression of these characteristics is naturally explained by the drop in the density of states @xmath21 at the fermi level .",
    "note that this interpretation is obviously oversimplified , moreover when we discuss the temperature dependence of these physical characteristics .",
    "for example , in the case of resistivity this dependence is usually mainly determined by inelastic scattering processes and the physical mechanism of these in htsc ",
    "cuprates is still far from being clear .",
    "the drop in the density of states , interpreted as partial dielectrization of electronic spectrum , may also lead to the appropriate growth of resistivity .    in fig.[ktr",
    "] taken from ref.@xcite we show the summary of experimental data for underdoped samples of @xmath37 using the results of refs.@xcite .    in fig.[t1h ]",
    "we show the data of ref.@xcite on the measurements of @xmath33 on @xmath38-nuclei in slightly underdoped @xmath29 in strong enough magnetic field .",
    "it is seen that the magnetic field dependence of the data is practically absent , giving the strong support for non - superconducting nature of the pseudogap , as in the opposite case magnetic field should significantly change the size of the effect . note that the expected influence of magnetic field upon the knight shift and nmr relaxation of @xmath38 was observed in slightly overdoped @xmath39 where it was accurately described by the effects of suppression of superconducting fluctuations @xcite .",
    "this fact can be seen as an evidence of disappearance of the pseudogap of non - superconducting nature ( independent of magnetic field ) at some lower concentration of current carriers .",
    "let us stress that in different experiments the characteristic temperature @xmath12 below which the anomalies attributed to pseudogap appear can somehow change depending on the quantity being measured .",
    "however , in most cases there is a systematic dependence of @xmath12 on doping and this temperature tends to zero close to optimal concentration of current carriers or at slightly higher concentrations .",
    "it is clear that @xmath12 does not represent any strictly defined temperature ( e.g. of some phase transition ) but only determines some characteristic crossover temperature ( energy ) scale below which pseudogap anomalies appear .",
    "this energy scale may be determined from experimental data using some rough model of the energy dependence of the density of states close to the fermi level within the pseudogap region ( e.g. triangular with the width of @xmath40 , giving @xmath41 ) @xcite . in fig.[eg ] we present the summary of the values of pseudogap width determined in this way from different experiments on @xmath30 for different hole concentrations @xcite .",
    "it is seen that the pseudogap `` closes '' at some critical value of @xmath28 .",
    "once again let us stress that both the line of @xmath12 on the phase diagram and `` critical '' concentration @xmath14 apparently possess only qualitative meaning . however , there are also attempts to interpret @xmath14 as some kind of a `` quantum '' critical point @xcite .",
    "pseudogap formation in underdoped htsc ",
    "cuprates is also clearly seen in numerous measurements of optical conductivity , both for electric field vector polarized along the highly conducting @xmath2 plane and along orthogonal direction of tetragonal axis @xmath42 .",
    "these experiments are reviewed in detail in ref.@xcite . as a typical example in fig.[optcond ]",
    "we show the data of ref.@xcite on optical conductivity in the @xmath2 - plane of underdoped @xmath43 .",
    "characteristic feature of these data is the presence of rather narrow `` drude - like '' peak in the frequency region @xmath44 and the appearance of `` pseudogap suppression '' of conductivity in the interval of @xmath45 accompanied by smooth maximum around @xmath46 .",
    "especially sharply pseudogap anomalies are seen after the experimental data are expressed in terms of the so called generalized drude formula @xcite , which introduces the effective ( frequency dependent ) scattering rate and effective mass of current carriers : @xmath47 where @xmath48  the observed complex conductivity , @xmath49  plasma frequency , @xmath50  mass of the free electron .",
    "note that the use of expressions ( [ sgdr ] ) , ( [ mgdr ] ) is just another form of expression of the same experimental data in the form of @xmath51 and @xmath52 instead of two more usual characteristics  the real and imaginary parts of conductivity .",
    "accordingly there is no especially deep physical meaning in both @xmath53 and @xmath52 .",
    "however , this form of presentation of experimental data in optics is widely used in the literature .    in fig.[gendr ]",
    "we present the results of such a representation of experimental data of the sort shown in fig.[optcond ] @xcite .",
    "it is seen that the effective scattering rate for temperatures less than @xmath54 is sharply suppressed for frequencies of an external field less than @xmath55 , while for higher frequencies @xmath56 grows linearly with @xmath57 , demonstrating the anomalous non - fermi liquid behavior .",
    "the presence of this dip in @xmath51 is most vivid reflection of the pseudogap in optical data . at the same time we have to note that the frequency dependence of @xmath52 shown in fig.[gendr ] apparently has no clear interpretation .",
    "analogous behavior of @xmath51 is also observed in data on transverse optical conductivity @xmath58 , practically for all htsc  cuprates studied in underdoped region @xcite .      especially spectacular effects due to formation of the pseudogap are observed in experiments on angle  resolved photoemission ( arpes ) @xcite .",
    "this method is , first of all , decisive in studies of the topology of the fermi surface of htsc  cuprates @xcite , being practically the sole source of this information .    in fig.[fslsco ]",
    "we show the data of ref.@xcite on the fermi surface of @xmath59 for two different compositions . in overdoped state @xmath60 fermi surface",
    "is electronic and centered around the point @xmath61 in brillouin zone . as concentration @xmath62 diminishes the topology of the fermi surface changes , so that for optimal concentration of @xmath63 and in underdoped region @xmath64 it becomes hole - like and centered around the point @xmath65 .",
    "precisely this topology is observed in majority of arpes ",
    "experiments for almost all htsc  cuprates .    as an interesting example in fig.[fsbisco ] from ref.@xcite",
    "we show the hole - like fermi surface of most extensively studied ( by arpes ) system @xmath32 in overdoped state .",
    "the spectacular feature here is the observation of large flat parts of the fermi surface , orthogonal to direction @xmath66 and symmetric directions . independently",
    "this result was confirmed in ref.@xcite for optimally doped system .",
    "the presence of the flat parts ( patches ) on the fermi surface may be very important for the construction of microscopic theories of electronic properties of htsc  systems .",
    "dropping these fine details in the first rough enough approximation the observed topology of the fermi surface and the spectrum of elementary excitations in the @xmath2 plane can be rather accurately described by the tight - binding model : @xmath67 where @xmath68  transfer integral between nearest neighbors , and @xmath69  transfer integral between second nearest neighbors , which may change between @xmath70 for @xmath29 and @xmath71 for @xmath59 , @xmath72  lattice constant .",
    "quite recently the simple picture described above was seriously revised in refs.@xcite using the new arpes data obtained with synchrotron radiation of higher energy , than in previous experiments .",
    "it was claimed that the fermi surface of @xmath32 is electronic and centered around point @xmath73 .",
    "the main discrepancies with previous data are in the most interesting ( for us ) vicinity of the point @xmath74 in the inverse space .",
    "these claims , however , were met with sharp objections from other groups of arpes experimentalists @xcite .",
    "the question remains open , but in the following we shall adhere to traditional interpretation .",
    "there are several good reviews on the observation of pseudogap anomalies in arpes experiments @xcite , so below we shall limit ourselves only to basic qualitative statements .",
    "the intensity of arpes ( energy distribution of photoelectrons ) in fact is determined as @xcite : @xmath75 where @xmath76  is the electron momentum in the brillouin zone , @xmath57  the energy of initial state with respect to the fermi level ( chemical potential ) is measured with respect to the fermi level of some good metal like @xmath77 or @xmath78 which is put into electric contact with the sample . ] , @xmath79 includes kinematic factors and the square of the matrix element of electron  photon interaction ( and in rough enough approximation can be considered a constant ) .",
    "the value @xmath80 where @xmath81  is the green s function , represents the spectral density of electrons .",
    "fermi distribution @xmath82^{-1}$ ] reflects the fact that only electrons from the occupied states participate in photoemission .",
    "thus in a rough approximation we may say that arpes experiments directly measure the product of @xmath83 , and we can get the direct information on the spectral properties of single - particle excitations in our system .    in fig.[arpes ]",
    "we show typical arpes data for @xmath84 @xcite , measured in three different points on the fermi surface for different temperatures .    the appearance of the gap ( pseudogap ) is reflected in the shift ( to the left ) of the leading edge of photoelectron energy distribution curve , compared to the reference spectrum of a good metal @xmath85 .",
    "it is seen that the gap is closed at different temperatures for for different values of @xmath86 , while its width diminishes as we move away from @xmath87 direction .",
    "pseudogap is completely absent in the direction of the zone diagonal @xmath88 . at low temperatures these data",
    "are consistent with the picture of @xmath89-wave pairing , which is well established from numerous experiments on htsc  cuprates @xcite .",
    "it is important , however , that this `` gap '' in arpes data is observed also for temperatures significantly higher than the temperature of superconducting transition @xmath0 .    in fig.[arpgap ]",
    "we show the angular dependence of the gap width in the brillouin zone and the temperature dependence of its maximum value for the number of samples of @xmath32 with different oxygen content , obtained via arpes in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is seen that with the general @xmath89-wave symmetry , the gap in the spectrum of optimally doped system becomes zero practically at @xmath22 , while for underdoped samples there appear characteristic `` tails '' in the temperature dependence of the gap for @xmath19 , quite similar to those shown in fig.[dct ] .",
    "qualitatively we may say that the formation of anisotropic ( in reciprocal space ) pseudogap for @xmath19 , continuously evolving into superconducting gap for @xmath1 , leads to a `` destruction '' of the parts of the fermi surface of underdoped samples already for @xmath11 and around the point @xmath74 ( and symmetric to it ) , and that the effective width of these parts grows as the temperature is lowered @xcite .",
    "central point is , of course , the evolution of spectral density @xmath90 at the fermi surface . under rather plausible assumptions this",
    "may be directly obtained from arpes data @xcite . in case of electron - hole symmetry",
    "we have @xmath91 ( which is always valid close enough to the fermi level , in real systems for @xmath92 less than few tenths of @xmath93 ) , so that , with the account of @xmath94 , from ( [ iarp ] ) for @xmath95 we immediately get @xmath96 .",
    "thus , the spectral density at the fermi surface may be obtained directly from experiments , more precisely from the symmetrized arpes - spectrum @xmath97 . as an example of such approach , in fig.[isym ] we present the data of ref.@xcite for underdoped sample of @xmath32 with @xmath98 and overdoped sample with @xmath99 for different temperatures .",
    "it is seen that the existence of the pseudogap is reflected in typical two - peak structure of the spectral density , appearing for the underdoped system at temperatures significantly higher than @xmath0 .",
    "let us stress that well defined quasiparticles correspond to sharp enough peak of the spectral density @xmath90 at @xmath100 .",
    "this type of behavior is practically unobservable in htsc  cuprates , at least for @xmath19 . in principle , this does not seem surprising  it is rather difficult to imagine well defined quasiparticles almost in any system for @xmath101 ! however , the much improved resolution of modern arpes installations apparently allows to conclude , that the actual width of the peak observed is larger than experimental resolution , so that the problem can be studied experimentally @xcite .",
    "it appears that in superconducting state , for @xmath102 , in the vicinity of the crossing of the fermi surface with the diagonal of the brillouin zone ( @xmath88 direction ) , there appears sharp enough peak of the spectral density , corresponding to well defined quasiparticles @xcite .",
    "however in the vicinity of the point @xmath74 the fermi surface is `` destroyed '' by superconducting gap , corresponding to @xmath89-wave pairing , which leads to the two - peak structure of the spectral density .",
    "the smooth evolution of arpes pseudogap observed for @xmath19 into superconducting gap corresponding to @xmath89-wave pairing for @xmath1 is often considered as an evidence of superconducting nature of the pseudogap .",
    "however , most probably this is wrong . in this respect",
    "we should like to note the very interesting paper @xcite , where the arpes measurements were performed on dielectric oxide @xmath103 , which is structurally analogous to @xmath104 and becomes a high  temperature superconductor after doping by @xmath105 or @xmath4 .",
    "arpes measurements on this system were possible in insulating phase due to especially good quality of the sample surface .",
    "the exciting discovery made in ref.@xcite was apparently first observation of the `` remnant '' fermi surface in this mott dielectric , which is everywhere `` closed '' by the gap ( apparently of the mott ",
    "hubbard nature ) . at the same time",
    "a strong anisotropy of this gap in inverse space with the symmetry of @xmath89-wave type was also observed @xcite , very similar to analogous data for htsc ",
    "systems in metallic phase .",
    "it seems plausible that this anisotropic gap has the same nature as high - energy pseudogap say in @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "of course , it is quite clear that there is no any kind of cooper pairing in this insulator .",
    "pseudogap behavior is also observed in a number of other experiments , such as electronic raman scattering @xcite and magnetic scattering of neutrons @xcite .",
    "all these experiments are interpreted as an evidence for significant suppression of the single - particle density of states close to the fermi level of underdoped htsc - cuprates for temperatures @xmath11 , that is already in normal phase . due to a space shortage",
    "we shall not discuss these data in any detail , moreover that a good review of these can be found in papers cited above , as well as in ref.@xcite .",
    "as was already noted above there exist two main theoretical scenario to explain pseudogap anomalies of htsc  systems .",
    "the first is based on the model of cooper pair formation above the temperature of superconducting transition ( precursor pairing ) , while the second assumes that formation of the pseudogap state is due to fluctuations of short - range order of `` dielectric '' type ( e.g. antiferromagnetic or charge density wave ) existing in the underdoped region of the phase diagram and leading to strong scattering of electrons and pseudogap renormalization of the spectrum .",
    "this second scenario seems more preferable both because of experimental evidence , described above , and due to the simple fact that all pseudogap anomalies become stronger for stronger underdoping , when system moves from optimal ( for superconductivity ) composition towards insulating ( antiferromagnetic ) region on the phase diagram .",
    "consider typical fermi surface of current carriers in @xmath2 plane , shown in fig.[hspots ] .",
    "phase transition to antiferromagnetic state leads to doubling of lattice period and appearance of `` magnetic '' brillouin zone in reciprocal space , shown by dashed lines in fig.[hspots ] .",
    "if the energy spectrum of current carriers is given by ( [ tbspectr ] ) with @xmath106 , then for the case of half - filled band the fermi surface is just a square coinciding borders of magnetic zone and there is complete nesting  flat parts of the fermi surface coincide after translation by vector of antiferromagnetism @xmath107 . for @xmath108 electronic spectrum is unstable  energy gap is opened everywhere at the fermi surface and the system becomes insulator due to formation of antiferromagnetic spin density wave ( sdw ) these arguments lay behind the popular explanation of antiferromagnetism of htsc  cuprates , let us quote e.g. ref.@xcite .",
    "the review of this and similar models can be found in @xcite .    in the case of the fermi surface shown in fig.[hspots ]",
    "the appearance of antiferromagnetic long - range order , in accordance with general rules of the band theory @xcite , leads to the appearance of discontinuities of isoenergetic surfaces ( e.g. fermi surface ) at crossing points with borders of new ( magnetic ) brillouin zone due to gap opening at points connected by vector @xmath109 .    in the most part of underdoped region of the phase diagram of htsc  cuprates there is no antiferromagnetic long - range order , however quite a number of experiments indicates the existence ( below the @xmath12 line ) of well developed fluctuations of antiferromagnetic short - range order . in the model of `` nearly antiferromagnetic '' fermi liquid @xcite an effective interaction of electrons with spin fluctuations",
    "is described by dynamic spin susceptibility @xmath110 , which can be written in the following form determined from the fit to nmr experiments @xcite : @xmath111 where @xmath112  is the coupling constant , @xmath113  correlation length of spin fluctuations ( short - range order ) , @xmath107  vector of antiferromagnetic ordering in insulating phase , @xmath114  characteristic frequency of spin fluctuations .    due to the fact that dynamic spin susceptibility @xmath110 possesses peaks at wave vectors smeared around @xmath115 , there appear `` two types '' of quasiparticles  `` hot quasiparticles '' with momenta from the vicinity of `` hot spots '' at the fermi surface ( fig.[hspots ] ) and with energies satisfying the following inequality ( @xmath116  velocity at the fermi surface ) : @xmath117 and `` cold '' ones , with momenta close to the parts of the fermi surface around brillouin zone diagonals @xmath118 and not satisfying ( [ hsp ] ) @xcite .",
    "this terminology is due to the fact that quasiparticles from the vicinity of `` hot spots '' are strongly scattered with momentum transfer of the order of @xmath109 , because of strong interaction with spin fluctuations ( [ v ] ) , while for quasiparticles with momenta far from `` hot spots '' this interaction is much weaker . in the following this model",
    "will be called `` hot spot '' model , which scatters electrons from one side of the fermi surface to other",
    ". this type of scattering may be also due to charge ( cdw ) or structural fluctuations . ] .",
    "correlation length of short - range order fluctuations @xmath113 , defined in ( [ v ] ) , is very important for the following discussion .",
    "note that in real htsc ",
    "systems it is usually not very large and changes in the interval of @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "characteristic frequency of spin fluctuations @xmath114 , depending on the compound and doping , is usually in the interval of @xmath120 @xcite , so that in most part of pseudogap region on the phase diagram we can satisfy an inequality @xmath121 , which allows us to neglect spin dynamics and use quasistatic approximation : @xmath122 where @xmath123  is an effective parameter of dimensions of energy , which in the model of afm fluctuations can be written as @xcite : @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the spin on the lattice site ( ion of @xmath126 in the @xmath2 plane of htsc  cuprates ) .    in the following",
    "we shall consider both @xmath123 and @xmath113 as phenomenological parameters .",

    "the analysis can be done even without assuming specific pairing mechanism , as it is done e.g. in the problem of the influence of structural disordering , impurities etc . from the physical point of view",
    "the least justified is the used above assumption of static nature of short - range order fluctuations , as dynamics of these fluctuations ( e.g. in the model based on ( [ v ] ) ) is apparently decisive at low enough temperatures ( in superconducting phase ) , being responsible also for the pairing mechanism itself .",

    "both `` hot spots '' and `` hot patches '' models can be solved `` nearly exactly '' @xcite , which allows significant progress in the analysis of pseudogap influence upon superconductivity .",
    "let us stress once again that it is not very important whether we use afm - fluctuations model ( as most popular in the literature ) of the model of short -rang order fluctuations of some other nature , leading to partial dielectrization of the spectrum ( such as cdw or structural ) .",
    "deficiencies of our models are due to simplifying assumptions necessary to obtain these `` nearly exact '' solutions .",
    "the main of these are the static approximation and assumption of gaussian nature of short - range order fluctuations .",
    "the account of dynamic nature of fluctuations is absolutely necessary for low enough temperatures , particularly in superconducting phase where pairing itself may be due dynamics of these fluctuations @xcite .",
    "we feel , however , that simplified analysis given above may in fact describe the most important effects of pseudogap renormalization of electronic spectrum ( pseudogap formation on `` hot '' parts of the fermi surface ) and its influence upon superconductivity .",
    "the account of dynamics of spin fluctuations will inevitably lead us outside the simple phenomenology of bcs model .",
    "assumption of gaussian statistics of fluctuations also may be justified only for high enough temperatures and not very close to the line of antiferromagnetic instability .",

    "the extension of our semi - phenomenological approach can be apparently done within the framework of full microscopic analysis of the problem , e.g. on the basis of the hubbard model .",
    "such attempts were made in a number of papers , e.g. in refs .",
    "@xcite cited above , as well as in refs .",
    "though many qualitative conclusions of these papers coincide or are close to those discussed above , the analysis is in most cases restricted to first diagrams of perturbation series @xcite and some kind of self - consistent procedure on this basis . in this case",

    "however , any generalization to higher order contributions is difficult enough .",
    "microscopic justification of the existence of the wide region of the phase diagram with well developed fluctuations of afm ( sdw ) short - range order is , of course , of principal importance .",
    "it should be noted that this region of `` critical '' fluctuations may be wide enough just due to the low dimensionality ( quasi two - dimensional nature ) of htsc - systems .",
    "for example , the region of superconducting critical fluctuations in htsc - cuprates may reach the width of some tens of degrees @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "as afm fluctuations are characterized by an energy scale which is an order of magnitude higher , the existence of the `` critical '' region with the width of some hundreds degrees does not seem improbable .",
    "however , the microscopic justification of such picture is still absent .",
    "probably the main qualitative conclusion from our theoretical picture concerns the old discussion about fermi - liquid or non fermi - liquid nature of electronic spectrum in htsc - cuprates . according to our simple models",
    "the electronic spectrum ( spectral density ) is fermi - liquid like only on `` cold '' parts of the fermi surface ( in the vicinity of brillouin zone diagonals ) , while on `` hot '' parts the spectral density is in general non fermi - liquid like due to strong scattering on afm fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the presence or absence of fermi - liquid behavior essentially depends on the value of correlation length of short - range order @xmath113 ( cf .",

    "particularly , in ref.@xcite it was claimed that fermi - liquid like behavior of the quasiparticle damping is absent everywhere on the fermi surface and there is no significant momentum dependence of this damping .",
    "in fact the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite had to introduce the significant momentum dependence of static scattering rate attributed to anisotropic impurity scattering , which was necessary to fit data , even for optimally doped system .",
    "linear dependence of damping rate on the energy of quasiparticles , which is observed in htsc - cuprates ( and postulated in `` marginal '' fermi - liquid theory ) , can not disprove the usual fermi - liquid theory , because the standard quadratic dependence of da[21  mping may be observable only in some very narrow energy interval close to fermi level , which is apparently smaller than typical precision of arpes experiments .",
    "rather detailed discussion of this point of view can be found in recent reviews @xcite .",
    "it must be stressed that the existence of anomalous scattering by afm fluctuations ( with wave vectors of the order of the vector of antiferromagnetism ) is beyond any doubts .",
    "our theoretical discussion also used rather traditional scheme of averaging over the random field of afm ( sdw , cdw ) fluctuations , which assumes the average spatial homogeneity of the system . at the same time a number of experimental data and theoretical models stress the possible phase separation in some htsc - cuprates ( especially in underdoped region ) @xcite .",
    "this phase separation takes place on microscopic scales and the system consists of `` metallic '' ( superconducting ) and `` dielectric '' ( antiferromagnetic ) `` stripes '' with the width of the order of few interatomic distances .",
    "naturally this situation can hardly be described using standard methods used above , while in the opinion of many authors these `` stripes '' may be of primary importance for the physics of htsc .",
    "we shall only note , that the qualitative picture of the random field of afm ( sdw , cdw ) fluctuations introduced above also implicitly assumes the appearance of effectively antiferromagnetic regions of the size of the order of @xmath212 intermixed with the regions of the same size , where afm order is destroyed . in this sense",
    "the picture used above seems to be not drastically different from the concept of phase separation ( `` stripes '' ) , being different mainly by the smoothness of borders between the `` metallic '' and `` non - metallic '' regions . note also that the formalism of the number of models of phase separation is based upon the idea of the closeness of the system to some kind of cdw instability @xcite and explicitly introduces scattering by fluctuations with special wave vectors .    it is well known that a lot of anomalies is observed in htsc - systems under strong structural disordering @xcite . the question of the importance of structural disordering in the pseudogap state is almost not investigated .",
    "we may mention only few papers , where the effects of random impurities were studied @xcite . from these preliminary results",
    "it may be concluded that controlled disordering may be rather informative method of studies of the pseudogap state .",
    "theoretically these problems are not studied at all .",
    "the studies of pseudogap anomalies in htsc - systems can lead also to rather important conclusions with respect to possible applications .",
    "we have seen that pseudogap formation in some sense suppresses superconductivity and , in fact , such important characteristics of superconductors as critical current and critical magnetic fields are maximal not at optimal doping @xmath7 , corresponding to maximal @xmath0 , but in the vicinity of the `` critical '' doping @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "this fact may be of some significance for optimization of technical superconductors made of htsc - cuprates .",
    "this work was supported in part by the grants of the russian foundation of basic research 99 - 02 - 16285 and crdf no .",
    "rec-005 , as well as by the projects 108 - 11(00)-@xmath385 of the state program on `` statistical physics '' and 96 - 051 of the state program on htsc .",
