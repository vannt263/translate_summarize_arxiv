    "after the discovery of the step - like features in the current - voltage characteristics of superconducting whiskers @xcite and the explanation of this effect through the nucleation of phase slip centers @xcite this phenomenon attracted a lot of attention from several experimental and theoretical groups ( see refs.@xcite for reviews ) .",
    "this effect is a consequence of the nontrivial dynamics of the superconducting condensate and the normal quasiparticles near the phase slip center @xcite . during the phase slip process",
    "the gap goes periodically in time to zero in one point along the sample and it creates an excess of quasiparticles ( electron - like and hole like ) near this region . due to the relatively large time of relaxation of nonequilibrium quasiparticles in the superconductor they may diffuse on a distance much larger than the coherence length ( the size of suppression of the gap ) @xcite .",
    "it results in the existence of a nonzero electrical field ( as a response to the gradient of chemical potential of nonequilibrium quasiparticles ) and a finite time - dependent voltage drop near the phase slip center .",
    "unfortunately , strong heat dissipation masks this effect at temperatures far from the critical temperature @xcite t@xmath0 which prohibited the study of this effect in full details .",
    "recently , this subject was revisited because new experimental techniques were developed which made it possible to prepare samples with low resistance @xcite ( i.e. diminishing the heating effects at low temperatures ) or by using pulsed techniques @xcite .",
    "the existence of phase slip centers / lines was confirmed in high - temperature superconductors @xcite and they were found to lead to s - shaped i - v characteristics in the voltage driven regime @xcite .",
    "recently phase slip lines were directly observed @xcite in low temperature superconducting stripes . in refs .",
    "@xcite a new type of vortex dynamics ( so called vortex channelling @xcite or the appearance of `` kinematical '' vortices",
    "@xcite ) was proposed which , in our opinion , is the `` bridge '' between slow vortex motion and the fast phase slip line regime . furthermore , in ref.@xcite the experimental observation of quantum phase slips was claimed .",
    "m.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    in this paper we present experimental results on the current - voltage characteristics of a mesoscopic superconducting square with leads . in this geometry ,",
    "the contacts play a crucial role ( see fig .",
    "1 ) because the current density is maximal in them . therefore we can not consider those contacts in equilibrium .",
    "this is essentially different from previous work on superconducting film / bridge attached to `` massive '' superconducting `` banks '' where it was possible to assume the contacts in equilibrium . at low magnetic fields phase slip centers",
    "will appear in our sample in the narrowest places , where the current density is maximal . because of inevitable heat dissipation the sample can transit locally to the normal state ( for weak heat transfer ) or to the superconducting resistive state ( for strong heat transfer ) .",
    "in both cases the i - v characteristics are hysteretic due to heat dissipation and/or the dynamics of the superconducting condensate .",
    "additional complications come from the effect of the magnetic field induced currents in the square on the phase slip process in the contacts .",

    "to understand the experimental results we studied the current - voltage characteristics of two - dimensional superconductors using the generalized time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) equation @xcite @xmath16 where the parameter @xmath17 is the product of the inelastic collision time @xmath18 for electron - phonon scattering and @xmath19 is the value of the gap at @xmath20 which follows from gorkov s derivation @xcite of the ginzburg - landau equations .",

    "the magnetic field effects the hysteresis through the local suppression of the order parameter @xcite .",
    "this is the main origin of the decreasing and finally the disappearance of the hysteresis at the transition from the superconducting state or slow vortex flow regime to the phase slip regime at high magnetic fields .",
    "another effect of the magnetic field is the slow increase of @xmath57 at low magnetic fields .",

    "7 we present our results for two relatively small values of the heat transfer coefficient @xmath121 . at low and intermediate magnetic fields the whole sample goes into the normal state ( with @xmath125 or @xmath51 ) at the current @xmath116 because of the large heat dissipation which is connected with the phase slip process .",

    "we explain these cusps by abrupt changes in the vorticity and hence sharp changes in the order parameter distribution ( see fig . 5 ) .",
    "the main difference between theory and experiment is in the amplitude of the variation of @xmath58 with @xmath114 ( the theory predicts larger values ) and in the value of this critical current .",
    "we believe that this disagreement originates mainly from the difference in the real shape of the attached contacts ( fig . 1 ) and the contacts used in our model ( fig .",
    "4 ) . in the experimental case",
    "there is a voltage lead which strengthen the superconducting property near the narrowest point ( as it was shown in the quasi - one dimensional limit in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and actually shifts the position of the phase slip center further from the square . therefore",
    ", the effect of the variation of the order parameter in the square ( with applied field ) should be less pronounced on the phase slip process in the contacts .",
    "variations in @xmath58 become stronger at @xmath133 when the resistive regime starts from the vortex flow regime in the square and hence the effect of a change in the vorticity is more visible.    we interpret the black right line in fig .",
    "3 as the line corresponding to the transition from the vortex flow to the phase slip line regime induced by increasing current at which a jump in the heat dissipation occurs .",
    "because the heat removal is not effective , the square will become normal .",
    "otherwise , it will be in the superconducting resistive state with a resistance close to the normal one .",
    "here we would like to stress the following . in aluminium",
    "the decay length of the charge imbalance @xmath134 or , in other words , the region where the normal current density is finite near the phase slip center @xcite is quite large @xcite @xmath135 .",
    "the size of our sample is much less than @xmath134 .",
    "so in this case it is quite difficult to distinguish between the normal and the superconducting resistive state because the differential resistance would be the same and equal to the normal one ( see ref .",
    "[ 30 ] in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "with decreasing current ( in absolute value ) we cross the left black line ( fig .",
    "3 ) and at low magnetic fields almost immediately enter the zero resistance state .",
    "actually , the current @xmath57 even increases a little .",
    "the same increase of @xmath57 can be reproduced theoretically if we assume that these transitions occur due to the decay of the phase slip process in the contacts at strong heat removal ( see fig .",
    "a comparison with the experiment also shows that with increasing @xmath114 we cross the left black line and do not enter the zero resistance state .",
    "thus , we are probably in the vortex flow state but with the sample temperature larger than the bath temperature",
    ". the sample can be in the resistive state up to lower currents than it can be at the bath temperature ( see figs .",
    "7,8 for small heat transfer coefficient ) .    at",
    "very high fields dissipation is not very important at currents close to the critical ones @xmath136 ( due to their small value ) and besides there is no internal hysteresis due to the phase slip process . as a result there is no hysteresis in the current when the non - zero resistance state appears and when a fast change in the resistance occurs in our sample .",
    "hysteresis in the current - voltage characteristics of superconducting wires , films or mesoscopic samples may appear due to heat dissipation or / and due to internal hysteresis connected with the existence of phase slip lines / centers .",
    "we believe that in our measurements we have both types of hysteresis which are responsible for the observed effects . at low magnetic fields",
    "the sample enters the normal state due to the appearance of the phase slip process and a strong heat dissipation at the critical current @xmath58 . because of a discrete change of the vorticity in the superconducting square the order parameter changes abruptly at some values of h and it leads to cusps in the dependence of @xmath59 . at higher fields , instead of a high dissipative phase slip process",
    ", we have slow vortex motion and heat dissipation results in a weak effect on the i - v characteristics for @xmath137 .",
    "when we decrease the current ( at fixed value of the magnetic field ) the sample goes first from the normal to the superconducting resistive state ( left black line in fig .",
    "3 ) and than slow vortex flow starts in the superconducting strip ( at high magnetic fields ) or the phase slip process in the contacts ( at low magnetic field ) .",
    "because the temperature of the sample may be higher than the bath temperature , the current , at which the sample goes to the nonresistive state , may be smaller than @xmath58 even if the resistive state starts as a vortex flow .",
    "so actually we need heat dissipation to explain this effect .",
    "one of the main results of our paper is that we show ( by a self - consistent solution of the time - dependent ginzburg - landau equation and the heat diffusion equation ) that _ heat dissipation does not necessarily lead to the destruction of superconductivity _ as it was supposed in a recent paper @xcite ( in order to explain recent experiments on moge films ( see references therein ) ) . in these samples",
    "the value of the coefficient @xmath138 is quite small due to the small value of the normal conductivity and both critical currents @xmath57 and @xmath58 are rather large because of the absence of the external magnetic field . in general",
    ", the situation may be more complicated when heating does not destroy superconductivity .",
    "in such a case , heating leads to additional complexity in the dynamics of the superconducting condensate due to the local heating of the sample .",
    "another result is , that by comparing the experimental and theoretical @xmath59 dependence we may distinguish @xcite between the giant vortex and the single quantum vortex state which appear in the sample .",
    "it allows , in principle , to study experimentally the transformation between these two different configurations as a function of the shape , size of the sample and external magnetic field .",
