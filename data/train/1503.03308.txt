    "the radio frequency ( rf ) spectrum used in industrial , scientific and medical radio bands and telecommunication radio bands are crowded with various wireless communication systems . recently ,",
    "optical wireless communication technology , where information is conveyed through optical radiations in free space in outdoor and indoor environments , is emerging as a promising complementary technology to rf communication technology . while communication using infrared wavelengths has been in existence for quite some time @xcite,@xcite , more recent interest centers around indoor communication using visible light wavelengths @xcite,@xcite .",
    "a major attraction in indoor visible light communication ( vlc ) is the potential to simultaneously provide both energy - efficient lighting as well as high - speed short - range communication using inexpensive high - luminance light - emitting diodes ( led ) .",
    "several other advantages including no rf radiation hazard , abundant vlc spectrum at no cost , and very high data rates make vlc increasingly popular . for example , a 3 gbps single - led vlc link based on ofdm has been reported recently @xcite .",
    "also , multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) techniques , which are immensely successful and popular in rf communications @xcite,@xcite , can be employed in vlc systems to achieve improved communication efficiencies @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . in particular",
    ", it has been shown that mimo techniques can provide gains in vlc systems even under line - of - sight ( los ) conditions which provide only little channel differences @xcite .",
    "our new contribution in this paper is the investigation of _ generalized spatial modulation ( gsm ) _ , an attractive mimo transmission scheme , in the context of vlc .",
    "such a study , to our knowledge , has not been reported before .    in the context of vlc systems ,",
    "mimo techniques including spatial multiplexing ( smp ) , space shift keying ( ssk ) , generalized space shift keying ( gssk ) , and spatial modulation ( sm ) have been investigated in the literature @xcite-@xcite . in smp , there are @xmath0 leds at the transmitter and all of them are activated simultaneously in a given channel use , such that @xmath0 symbols from a positive real - valued @xmath5-ary pulse amplitude modulation ( pam ) alphabet @xmath6 are sent in a channel use @xcite .",
    "thus , the transmission efficiency in smp is @xmath7 bits per channel use ( bpcu ) . in ssk , there are @xmath0 leds , out of which only one will be activated in a given channel use @xcite .",
    "the led to be activated is chosen based on @xmath8 information bits .",
    "only the index of this active led will convey information bits , so that the transmission efficiency is @xmath9 bpcu .",
    "this means that a large number of leds is needed to achieve high transmission efficiencies in ssk .",
    "that is , since @xmath10 , the number of leds required in ssk is exponential in the transmission efficiency @xmath11 . on the other hand , ssk has the advantage of having no interference , since only one led will be active at any given time and the remaining leds will be off .",
    "gssk is a generalization of ssk , in which @xmath1 out of @xmath0 leds will be activated in a given channel use , and the indices of the active leds will convey information bits @xcite-@xcite .",
    "since there are @xmath12 possibilities of choosing the active leds , the transmission efficiency in gssk is given by @xmath13 bpcu .",
    "sm is similar to ssk ( i.e. , one out of @xmath0 leds is activated and this active led is chosen based on @xmath14 information bits ) , except that in sm a symbol from a positive real - valued @xmath5-ary pam alphabet @xmath6 is sent on the active led .",
    "so , the transmission efficiency in sm is @xmath15 bpcu .",
    "a comparative study of smp and sm in vlc systems has shown that , for the same transmission efficiency , sm outperforms smp under certain geometric conditions @xcite .    like the generalization of ssk to gssk",
    ", it is possible to generalize sm .",
    "that is , activate @xmath1 out of @xmath0 leds in a given channel use , and , on each active led , send a symbol from a positive real - valued @xmath5-ary pam alphabet @xmath6 .",
    "such a scheme , referred to as _ generalized spatial modulation ( gsm ) _ , then has a transmission efficiency of @xmath16 bpcu .",
    "note that both sm and smp become special cases of gsm for @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "gsm in the context of rf communications has been investigated in the literature @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , gsm in the context of vlc systems has not been reported so far .",
