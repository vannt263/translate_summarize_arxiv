    "in the @xmath1  model , smaller structures falling into larger haloes can survive there as substructures and host observed satellite galaxies .",
    "therefore , the distribution of satellites around primaries holds important information about galaxy formation , the population of substructures and even the nature of dark matter . in the past decade or so , fainter satellites around the milky way ( mw ) and m31 have been discovered in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "in addition , these data can constrain attempts to understand the formation of galaxies in subhalos using semi - analytic modelling techniques ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and full n - body / gasdynamic simulations to investigate the physics of satellite galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . the large body of work on satellite galaxies",
    "reflects the fact that they are not only a critical small scale test of the @xmath1  model , but also a probe of the nature of dark matter ; yet the satellite data with which all theories and models are compared with are merely those of two primaries , the mw and m31 .",
    "although the satellite populations of mw and m31 are known better than other satellite systems , there is no guarantee that they are typical .",
    "clearly , robust and reliable tests of cosmological and galaxy formation models require comparison with a statistically representative sample of galaxies and their satellites .",
    "early studies were limited by the relatively small satellite samples available at the time @xcite . with the advent of large galaxy redshift surveys such as the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ;",
    "* ) and the sdss @xcite , it is now possible to construct external galaxy samples spanning a much larger volume .",
    "studies with significantly improved statistics have been carried out using these new surveys .",
    "for example , @xcite studied the spatial distribution of satellites around primaries using the 2dfgrs .",
    "more recently @xcite studied how spectroscopically identified satellite galaxies were distributed in sdss groups relative to the orientation of the central galaxy . however , due to the flux limit of redshift surveys , analyzing the satellite systems of external isolated galaxies is still challenging because typically only one or two satellites are detected per primary galaxy .",
    "in addition , the real space position of satellites with respect to their primaries is uncertain due to redshift space distortions and projection effects . to circumvent the aforementioned problems ,",
    "we ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) have developed a method of stacking the primaries and their satellites in order to obtain a fair and complete sample that can yield statistically robust results for certain classes of primary galaxies .",
    "this method has been successfully applied to the estimation of the satellite luminosity functions of isolated primary galaxies in the sdss .    in this work , for the same primary and satellite samples we explored in paper i , we are now interested in the average spatial profile of the distribution of these satellites around their primaries .",
    "these density profiles are an important tracer of the distribution of substructures in the primary halo and can provide us with useful information to test current models of the formation and evolution of dark matter haloes .    in the cold dark matter ( cdm )",
    "cosmological model , the density profiles of dark matter haloes follow a universal form ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter nfw profiles ) with an inner cusp , @xmath2 , and an outer slope of @xmath3 . the transition scale , @xmath4 , is normally specified through the concentration , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is defined as the radius enclosing a mean interior density 200 times the critical density . besides the overall mass profile , it is remarkable that the spatial distribution of dark matter substructures , which could host satellites galaxies , also follows this universal form independent of the mass of the substructures @xcite .",
    "however , the number of observed satellite galaxies around the mw and m31 is much smaller than the number of substructures predicted by @xmath1  @xcite , giving rise to the so - called `` missing satellites problem '' .",
    "statistically robust number density profiles of observed satellites will certainly help us understand how satellite galaxies populate the substructures .",
    "in addition , a reliable density profile is required to extrapolate the incomplete observational data of satellites around the mw and m31 to compare with models ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the recognition of the importance of the spatial profiles of systems of satellite galaxies has resulted in many studies . early work with samples from a limited volume have mainly focused on fitting the slope of the density profile of satellite galaxies around isolated primaries @xcite . with large galaxy redshift surveys ,",
    "the dependence of the profiles on the colour and morphology of primaries has begun to be explored ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite studied the projected number density profiles and velocity dispersion around isolated red primaries using the sdss redshift sample .",
    "@xcite used an iterative method , tested on mock galaxy catalogues , to find satellite systems around central galaxies with a range of luminosities in the sdss .",
    "the distribution of velocities of the satellites was used to infer mass - to - light ratios as a function of central galaxy luminosity .",
    "closely related to this are studies of the radial distributions of satellite galaxies in clusters , groups @xcite and on smaller scales @xcite .",
    "further work has focused on the distribution of satellites around intermediate redshift galaxies @xcite , elliptical primaries @xcite and isolated galaxies in the sdss @xcite . besides the studies that statistically estimate mean number density profiles , @xcite have directly measured the number density profile of the nearby field galaxy m106 .    in this paper",
    ", we are not only interested in the projected number density profile of satellites around isolated primary galaxies binned by luminosity , colour and morphology , but also on the dependence of the profiles on the properties of the satellites themselves . to this end , we select our primary samples from the sdss dr8 spectroscopic sample ( @xmath7 galaxies ) and satellite candidates from the photometric samples ( @xmath8 galaxies ) with the same criteria as in paper i to build significantly large samples .",
    "we restrict the photometric sample to galaxies brighter than @xmath9 as in paper i ( see paper i , section 4 ) to ensure completeness . based on these large samples ,",
    "we explore the dependence of the density profiles on the properties of primaries and satellites .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organised as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly describe the selection of primary galaxies and their satellites ; in section 3 , we develop a method for estimating the projected satellite number density profile ; in section 4 , we present our estimate of the projected satellite number density for different primary samples .",
    "we conclude , in section 5 , with a summary and discussion of our results . throughout the paper",
    "we assume a fiducial @xmath10 cosmological model with @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 km  s@xmath14  mpc@xmath14 .",
    "we have built two separate catalogues similar to those in paper  i. the smaller one is of galaxies from the main sdss spectroscopic catalogue from which we select our primary galaxies ( hereafter the spectroscopic catalogue ) .",
    "the larger one is of galaxies with photometric redshifts and magnitudes from which we select the neighbouring galaxies ( hereafter the photometric catalogue ) .",
    "the spectroscopic catalogue is constructed from the sdss dr8 spectroscopic subsample ( north galactic cap ) including all objects with high quality redshifts ( zconf @xmath15 and specclass @xmath16 ) and a petrosian magnitude @xmath17 .",
    "the photometric galaxy catalogue is from the sdss dr8 photometric subsample ( north galactic cap ) and includes only objects that have photometric redshifts , none of the flags bright , saturated , or satur_center set and model magnitudes @xmath18 .",
    "we select only objects with corresponding entries in the sdss database photoz table , which naturally selects galaxies and excludes stars . as galaxies with @xmath17",
    "are included in both sdss catalogues , a small fraction of the photometric catalogue galaxies also have spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "we use de - reddened model @xmath19 magnitudes and @xmath20-correct all galaxies to @xmath21 with the idl code of @xcite .",
    "we estimate @xmath22-band magnitudes from @xmath23 and @xmath24-band magnitudes assuming @xmath25 @xcite and all our sample selection and magnitude cuts are performed using this @xmath22-band magnitude .    , centred on the primary , and nearby in redshift space . as defined in fig .",

    "satellites will lie nearby in redshift space and within the cylinder of radius @xmath33 ( red ) , whereas the local background to be subtracted is determined from the volume between this inner cylinder and the outer one with radius @xmath34 .",
    ", width=317 ]    our sample of isolated primary galaxies is chosen using the same criteria as in paper  i , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : method ] .",
    "we select primary galaxy candidates of absolute magnitude , @xmath35 , in the range @xmath36 .",
    "we then filter these primary candidates , using a series of criteria summarised in figure  1 of paper  i , to guarantee that a ) there are no luminous neighbouring galaxies projected within @xmath37 of the primary , unless these luminous neighbours are sufficiently separated in redshift from the primary and appear here due to a chance projection ; b ) the satellite search areas ( projected distance @xmath38 from the primary ) around each primary do not overlap with each other .",
    "further details of the generation of the two samples are may be found in paper  i. the values of the selection parameters , @xmath39 , are the same as the default values in paper  i. here @xmath40 is the half - width of the primary magnitude @xmath41 bin , @xmath42 is the magnitude difference between the primaries and satellites used to isolate primaries , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the parameters used to exclude galaxies that are at a significantly different spectroscopic redshift and photometric redshift respectively .",
    "the meaning of these parameters is explained in fig .",
    "[ fig : method ] ( see section  2 of paper  i for more details ) . one small change relative to paper  1",
    "is that @xmath33 is chosen to increase with increasing primary luminosity , in order to ensure that no satellites are missed for the most luminous primaries .",
    "once our primary galaxies are defined , their potential satellites are found from the photometric galaxy catalogue as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sat_pro ] .",
    "the method we use is similar to that in paper  i , except that for each primary , the number of galaxies is counted and binned by their projected radial distances from the primary , @xmath45 , as well as by their luminosity .",
    "that is , for the @xmath46th primary galaxy , the number of inner galaxies in each annulus , @xmath47 , is found by counting all the neighbouring galaxies within the annulus of radius @xmath48 that satisfy the following conditions : at least @xmath42 fainter than the primary ; if they have a spectroscopic redshift , @xmath49 , then they should satisfy @xmath50 ; or if they only have a photometric redshift @xmath51 , then they should satisfy @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the error in the photometric redshift as defined in paper  1 . the number of outer galaxies , @xmath54 ,",
    "is determined by applying the same conditions to galaxies in the outer area between @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "assuming , for now , that few genuine satellites will be projected beyond @xmath33 we can estimate the surface density of genuine satellites in each annulus as @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the areas of the inner annulus and outer region respectively . if necessary , we take account of the sky coverage of sdss dr8 by reducing the areas @xmath56 and @xmath57 by the amounts defined by the dr7 mask described in @xcite .",
    "because of the apparent magnitude limit of sdss , which we take to be @xmath58 , we count the faintest satellites only at low redshift and are progressively limited to more and more luminous satellites with increasing redshift . to account for this and construct an unbiased estimate of the projected satellite number density profile over all primary galaxies , we accumulate the area contributed by the @xmath46th primary to the @xmath59th annulus for the detection of satellites brighter than @xmath60 , @xmath61 here @xmath62 is the unmasked area of the @xmath59th annulus surrounding the @xmath46th primary and @xmath63 is the absolute magnitude that corresponds to the apparent magnitude limit , @xmath64 , of the sdss photometric catalogue at the redshift of the primary , @xmath65 , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the corresponding luminosity distance and @xmath20-correction .",
    "this contributing area is set to zero if any potential satellites within the magnitude bin are too faint to be included , in which case we exclude this primary and its satellites as its contribution to the mean projected satellite number density profile would be incomplete .",
    "we further define @xmath68 to be the number of detected potential satellites brighter than @xmath69 in the @xmath59th annulus surrounding the @xmath46th primary and @xmath70 to be the corresponding number of detected galaxies in the outer annulus , @xmath71 , whose unmasked area is @xmath72 .",
    "hence we can express the mean surface density of satellite galaxies brighter than @xmath73 in the @xmath59th annulus as @xmath74    in practice , we divide the projected radial distance from the primary into @xmath75 bins ( @xmath76 ) . because of a concern that the sdss data reduction pipeline may occasionally misclassifies fragments of the spiral arms of bright galaxies as separate galaxies we exclude individual annuli that are within 1.5 times the petrosian radius , @xmath77 , of the primary galaxy .",
    "we set our magnitude limit , @xmath78 , either by absolute value , such as @xmath79 , or by magnitude relative to the corresponding primary , @xmath80 .",
    "we present results using both thresholds so that we can determine whether the number density profiles depend on the absolute luminosity of satellites or on the relative luminosity between satellites and their primaries .",
    "the process of estimating the projected satellite number density profiles is quite similar to estimating the satellite luminosity functions in paper  i. we divide our primaries into three luminosity bins centred on @xmath81 .",
    "the choice of the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 are a balance between making them sufficiently large to avoid severely truncating the density profiles and making them too large such that our sample shrinks due to the selection process excluding overlapping systems .",
    "a sensible choice is to set @xmath33 to exceed the anticipated size of the satellite system , @xmath6 depicts the radius at which the mean interior density is @xmath82 times the cosmological critical density . ] , and @xmath34 to be roughly a factor of two larger so as to get a good , but still local , estimate of the background density .",
    "here we have adopted the following values of @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 for primaries in magnitude bins , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "the values of @xmath33 have been compared with the mean of the estimated @xmath6 values for each galaxy in the chosen magnitude bin ( see section 3 ) and are found all to be larger , suggesting that the search radii for the different primary magnitude bins are sufficiently large to capture all satellites .",
    "additional reassurance is provided by the tests in appendix  [ appendix : c ] , which show that the profiles are insensitive to changes in the values of @xmath33 or @xmath34 .      the projected radial satellite number density profile , @xmath88 , which is the focus of this paper , is the azimuthal average of the 2d surface density , @xmath89 , where @xmath90 can be taken as the position angle between the major axis of the primary and the line connecting the primary and satellite ( see fig  [ fig : theta ] ) . the angular dependence of this distribution may also carry information on the formation and evolution of the satellites around their primaries .",
    "for example , if we assume that the satellite galaxies inhabit an unbiased set of dark matter subhalos , then we would expect satellites to cluster preferentially along the major axis of the halo @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is known that the host halos of satellite systems are accreted from filaments , which can cause the angular distribution of satellites around primaries to be anisotropic @xcite .",
    "in fact , numerous such anisotropies have been observed .",
    "for example , the famous `` holmberg effect '' @xcite , suggests satellites of isolated , large , and inclined spiral galaxies are preferentially located along the minor axes of their primaries , a result supported by @xcite .",
    "however @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite found the opposite effect that satellites prefer alignment with the major axis , especially for the satellites of red primaries .",
    "since the direct observation of satellite systems is not easy , the sample of external satellite systems is limited in both volume and quality .",
    "these contradictory results may suggest that the mean amplitude of the anisotropy could be very weak , or the form of the anisotropy could be dependent on the selection of the primaries or even the satellites themselves .     which characterises the angular position of the satellite relative to the direction of the primary galaxy s major axis .",
    "the grey and blue ellipses are the primary and satellite galaxy , respectively .",
    "the angle @xmath91 is the position angle of the primary .",
    ", width=264 ]    it is therefore interesting to attempt to quantify the mean anisotropy of our large sample of satellite galaxies . we characterise the angular distribution using the position angle @xmath90 described in fig .  [ fig : theta ] .",
    "the assumed elliptical symmetry of the primary implies that @xmath90 ranges from @xmath92 to @xmath93 with these extremes indicating that the satellites are located along the major or minor axis respectively .",
    "the anisotropy of the angular distribution is then quantified by the probability distribution of the angle @xmath90 . in practice , accurate measurement of @xmath90 requires a robust measurement of the position angle @xmath91 defining the orientation of the primaries . to achieve this",
    ", we adopt the same selection criteria as @xcite .",
    "we only select primaries and their satellites that satisfy the condition , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the isophotal axis ratio defined as @xmath97 and @xmath98 is the adaptive moments axis ratio , @xmath99 where @xmath100 @xcite and @xmath101 are second - order parameters from sdss , where @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 here are the second - order adaptive moments . ] .",
    "we also exclude the primaries together with their satellites if there is a discrepancy of more than @xmath105  degrees between the measured isophotal and de vaucouleurs position angles , @xmath106 .",
    "for our sample of selected satellite systems , the number of satellites located at angle @xmath107 around the @xmath46th primary , can be estimated as @xmath108 where @xmath109 represents the azimuthal average as we assume the background galaxies are , on average , isotropically distributed .",
    "note that to avoid biasing the angular distribution we exclude systems that are incomplete due to the survey mask .",
    "we can then define an unbiased estimator of the average distribution of the satellite position angle @xmath90 for all selected primaries as @xmath110    , of the position angle @xmath90 of satellite galaxies . in the top panel",

    "[ fig : pd ] , we show the probability distribution of @xmath90 for two satellite subsamples split by rest frame colour of their primary galaxies .",
    "these samples are divided according to the well - known colour bimodality in the colour - magnitude plane ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "following @xcite , we use an equivalent colour criterion of @xmath119 ( not identical to @xcite as our magnitudes are @xmath20-corrected to @xmath120 rather than @xmath121 ) .",
    "the probability distributions of @xmath90 in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] are all consistent with isotropic distributions .",
    "this is confirmed by a two - sample kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test that compares the distributions of inner and outer galaxies for the whole primary sample and also the subsamples of red and blue primaries .",
    "the two - sample ks probabilities from the whole sample , blue and red primary subsamples are @xmath122 respectively , which implies that the pairs of distributions have no statistically significant differences . the same tests for primaries in other magnitude bins show similar results .",
    "therefore , with our satellite system sample , we find that there is no statistically significant evidence that the distribution of satellites around primaries is anisotropic .",
    "this could signify that the anisotropy of the distribution of satellites around isolated primaries is intrinsically insignificant .",
    "however , one also has to keep in mind that our inner sample includes contamination from interlopers , because these are only rejected using inaccurate photometric redshifts , and this could dilute any intrinsic anisotropy signal .",
    "we now return to the azimuthally averaged density profiles .",
    "density profiles for satellites brighter than @xmath78 around primaries of magnitude @xmath123 are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig_nor ] for a variety of primary magnitude bins and satellite magnitude cuts .",
    "panels  [ fig : fig_nor]a and [ fig : fig_nor]b show that the number of satellites increases with increasing primary luminosity and extends to larger radii . to investigate the variation in profile shape between different subsamples of satellites and primaries ,",
    "it is helpful to use scaled variables . to this end",
    ", we recast the profiles in terms of @xmath124 and divide the number densities by the total number of satellites within @xmath6 .",

    "the halo mass can be related to a radius through @xmath131        for the primary galaxies there is a significant uncertainty in the stellar mass that is inferred from the measured luminosities and colours .",
    "thus , rather than using the individual @xmath6 values to normalise satellite number density profiles for each primary before stacking them together , the mean @xmath6 for all primaries in the luminosity bin of interest is determined and a single rescaling is performed on the unscaled , stacked profile . using @xmath6 values determined in this way ,",
    "the @xmath132 and @xmath133 samples line up very well , as shown in panels  [ fig : fig_nor]c and [ fig : fig_nor]d . however , the @xmath134 results , not shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig_nor ] , are slightly offset .",
    "for these , the most luminous primaries , the relation between stellar mass and halo mass becomes very flat and there is a large spread in the halo mass corresponding to a given stellar mass .",
    "this makes the assignment of a value of @xmath6 to these primaries extremely uncertain .",
    "the directly inferred virial radius is 0.73  mpc but we find that a smaller value of 0.52  mpc results in better scalings . given the large uncertainty in this assignment , it is not unreasonable to adopt this smaller value .",
    "we shall do this in what follows but this uncertainty must be borne in mind when interpreting the results for the brightest primary bin .",

    "in contrast , in each panel , we see systematic variations in the shape and amplitude of the profiles with the primary luminosity .",
    "if instead we look at the left hand panels , which show satellites selected in different fixed magnitude bands , then we see that the concentration decreases steeply with increasing satellite luminosity , but is less dependent on the luminosity of the primary . with the exception of the brightest primary magnitude bin ( @xmath147 ) , the satellites of a given luminosity are more or less distributed in the same way about primaries of different luminosity .",
    "only the normalization of the profile , as parameterized by @xmath142 , increases with increasing primary luminosity .",
    "this depends quite strongly on luminosity going roughly as the luminosity to the power of @xmath148 . if we normalized each of these satellite profiles as we did in fig .",
    "[ fig : pro_same_p ] , then their shapes would show very little variation with primary luminosity .    for the case of primaries in the @xmath147 bin ,",
    "the measured concentrations for the satellite distributions are systematically lower than those of similar luminosity satellites around less luminous primaries .",
    "the reason for this is not clear .",
    "it may be that this result reflects the actual satellite distribution around bright primaries .",
    "however , it could be an artefact of the estimation procedure .",
    "one possibility is that the non - linearity of the halo mass - stellar mass relation @xcite means that the range of actual halo mass increases in the brightest primary bin .",
    "thus , stacking all primaries using a single @xmath6 value may be introducing errors that would smear out the resulting profile .",
    "another potential source of systematic error comes from the tendency for faint satellites to be missed around bright primaries because of inaccuracies in the sky - subtraction @xcite .",
    "even with the updated sky - subtraction algorithm employed for dr8 there may still be some residual loss of faint satellites around the brightest primary galaxies @xcite .",

    "the concentrations of red and blue satellites around blue primaries are similar .",
    "red primaries have lower concentrations for both their red and blue satellites , with the blue satellites having a particularly low concentration .",

    "using a stacking analysis we have estimated the mean projected density profiles of satellite galaxies around a large sample of isolated primary galaxies selected from the sdss dr8 spectroscopic galaxy catalogue and we have quantified how they depend on the properties of the satellites and primaries .",
    "the selection of primaries and the local background subtraction technique , which makes use of photometric redshifts , is the same as in paper  i @xcite where we estimated the mean satellite luminosity functions of these systems .",
    "our main conclusions are :    \\(i ) we find no evidence for any anistropy in the satellite galaxy distribution relative to the major axes of the primaries .",
    "\\(ii ) the projected number density profiles of satellites brighter than a @xmath22-band magnitude of @xmath157 are well determined for three separate bins of primary magnitude , @xmath158 .",
    "\\(iii ) apart from the faintest satellites , for which there is a slight excess at small galactocentric projected distance , all other density profiles are well fitted by projected nfw profiles that have been background subtracted to match the procedure that has been applied to the data .",
    "\\(iv ) the concentration of the nfw fits decreases systematically with increasing satellite luminosity and is almost independent of the luminosity of the primaries ( see fig .  [",

    "blue satellites are more numerous than red satellites at all radii ( for the luminosity range we probe ) and faint red satellites are more centrally concentrated ( higher nfw concentration ) than faint blue satellites .",
    "further sub - divided samples show that the concentration of the blue or red satellite profile depends more on the colour of the primaries than it does on the colour of the satellites .    as a check of potential systematic effects in our results",
    ", we have also performed the same analysis using the sdss dr7 dataset .",
    "generally , the results based on dr7 are consistent with those from dr8 , although we do observe some differences in the distribution of faint satellites .",
    "this is most likely due to less accurate photometric reduction and sky - background subtraction for dr7 ( see appendix  [ appendix : b ] for more details ) .    with the advantage of our large and carefully selected samples",
    ", we have discovered a variety of interesting information about the projected number density profiles , which it has not been possible to quantify clearly in previous work .",
    "however , even with a very limited sample , a pioneering study by @xcite found that the distribution of satellites is dependent on the morphology of primaries .",
    "they found that the number of satellites around early - type primaries is greater than that about late - type primaries and that the concentration of the satellite distribution is higher around early type primaries .",
    "we confirm the greater abundance of satellites around early - type primaries , but contrary to @xcite we find higher concentrations for satellite systems around late - type primaries .",
    "more recently , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite studied the projected number density profiles of satellites of isolated galaxies using larger samples from the two degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) and sdss .",
    "although @xcite cautioned that the profiles from 2dfgrs were incomplete because of incompleteness in close galaxy pairs , their study revealed that satellites followed nfw profiles .",
    "@xcite found that the profiles of satellites depart from a power law at small galactocentric projected distance , and that they are dependent on the colour of the primaries , which is similar to our conclusions ( iv ) and ( v ) .",
    "they also found the distribution of satellites to depend on their colour , but argued that this may be caused by the correlation between satellites and primaries . in our study , conclusion ( vi ) shows that the distribution of satellites not only depends on the properties of satellites , but also depends on the colour of primaries . @xcite and @xcite selected samples only from the sdss spectroscopic catalogue in their studies .",
    "@xcite found the 3d number density profiles of satellites can be fitted by a power - law with a slope @xmath159 .",
    "after projecting , the slope of this density profile will be close to ours . with a careful treatment of interlopers , they fitted the profiles with a power - law form and found them to be independent of the luminosity of the primaries .",
    "these conclusions are consistent with ours .",
    "very recently , @xcite estimated the radial density profiles of satellites around primary samples brighter than @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "they also found the amplitudes of the profiles depend on the luminosity of the primaries , and the shapes on their colour .",
    "the physics of the projected number density profiles of satellites involves both the physics of the hierarchical assembly of dark matter halos and the physics of the galaxy formation that occurs in these assembling halos . hence quantifying these profiles will help constrain both galaxy formation models and the nature of the dark matter .",
    "we expect that our profile results and those of others will be an important input into refining theoretical models and the next incarnation of full n - body / gasdynamic simulation that can resolve the physics of the formation of satellite galaxies .",
