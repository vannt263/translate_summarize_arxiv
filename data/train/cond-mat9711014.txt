    "for more than a decade now , much effort has been devoted to understanding the properties of a variety of insulating one - dimensional heisenberg antiferromagnets . by now , the basic facts about these systems are very well established : heisenberg antiferromagnetic ( haf ) chains with integer spins at each site exhibit a gap in their excitation spectrum while those with half- integer spins are gapless  @xcite . among the spin-@xmath11 ladder compounds ,",
    "those with an even number of legs exhibit a gap just like the integer spin chains  @xcite while ladders with an odd number of legs are gapless analogous to the half - integer chains  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the universal low - energy properties of the gapped systems are well described by the one dimensional quantum @xmath12 non - linear @xmath5-model ( nl@xmath13 m ) without any topological term  @xcite .",
    "a lot is known exactly about this field theory  @xcite and this is directly useful in understanding the gapped systems .",
    "the spectrum of the @xmath5-model consists of a triplet of massive spin-@xmath14 particles as the lowest energy excitations followed by multiparticle continua with no bound states .",
    "many zero temperature ( @xmath0 ) properties of the gapped systems , including low frequency dynamic correlations , can be explained using the exact information available on the @xmath5-model  @xcite . on the other hand , until very recently exact results for @xmath15 were restricted to static , thermodynamic properties  @xcite while many experimental observables ( such as the inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) crosssection and nmr relaxation rates ) directly probe dynamical correlations at non - zero temperature .",
    "( the universal low - energy properties of the gapless systems have been treated via a mapping to a certain critical field theory  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the nl@xmath5 m , powerful techniques that exploit the conformal invariance of the theory can be used to determine exactly for @xmath15 some dynamical correlators that are directly probed by nmr experiments  @xcite .",
    "similar methods have been used to obtain results for @xmath15 on static properties as well  @xcite .",
    "transport properties have also been studied recently  @xcite , with results that are quite different from those we shall obtain here for gapful systems . )",
    "this paper shall deal exclusively with the @xmath15 dynamical properties of gapped heisenberg spin chains .",
    "a portion of our results have appeared earlier in a short report  @xcite , where we presented them in the context of the continuum nl@xmath5 m , but did not fully discuss their range of applicability .",
    "here we shall take a more general point of view of working directly with lattice heisenberg antiferromagnets .",
    "the main , and essentially only , requirement on the spin chain being studied is that it have an energy gap and that its low - lying excitations consist of a triplet of spin-1 particles with the dispersion @xmath16 here @xmath17 is being measured from an antiferromagnetic wavevector @xmath18 ( @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the lattice spacing ) , and we have introduced a velocity @xmath21 to parametrize the mass of the particles as @xmath22 .",
    "this is in keeping with the ` relativistic ' spectrum of the @xmath4 @xmath5-model @xmath23 , although most of our results will _ not _ rely on this relativistic form .",
    "gapped spin chains with a spontaneously broken translational symmetry ( spin - peierls order ) can have spin-1/2 particle excitations : we shall not deal with this case explicitly , although we believe most of our results can also be extended to these systems .",
    "the energy gap @xmath1 is an important energy scale which shall play a central role in our analysis .",
    "the majority of our results will be in the regime @xmath2 ( we shall use units with @xmath24 throughout ) which we now discuss .    in this regime",
    ", there is a dilute gas of excited particles present , and their motion and collisions dominate the dynamical properties we study . in particular",
    "their spacing @xmath25 is much larger than their thermal de - broglie wavelength @xmath26 . as argued in ref  @xcite , these particles can be treated classically except when two of them collide .",
    "such two - particle collisions need to be treated quantum - mechanically and are described by an @xmath27-matrix , which is , in general , a complicated function of the particle momenta and spin orientations .",
    "conservation of total momentum and energy implies that momenta before and after collisions have to be the same , and @xmath4 invariance and unitarity impose further constraints , but a fairly complex structure is still permitted  we will see some explicit examples in this paper .",
    "however , the r.m.s .",
    "thermal velocity of a particle @xmath28 as @xmath29",
    "and thus we need the @xmath3-matrix only in the limit of vanishing incoming ( and outgoing ) momenta .",
    "one of the central ingredients in our computations will be our claim that in this limit , all of the complexity disappears , and the @xmath3-matrix has a _ super - universal _ form ; for the scattering event shown in fig  [ fig1 ] we have ( here @xmath30 are the three possible values of the @xmath4 spin label ) @xmath31 notice especially the opposite pairing of momentum and spin labels : crudely speaking , the momenta go `` through '' the collision , while the spins `` bounce off''this dichotomy will be crucial to our considerations .",
    "we dub this limiting value of the @xmath3-matrix ` super - universal ' as it requires only that the lowest lying excitations above the gap satisfy ( [ dispersion ] ) at low momenta .",
    "the value , however , does not depend on parameters such as @xmath21 and @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , we expect this limiting result to hold even at the lattice level for generic microscopic models of one - dimensional antiferromagnets with massive spin one excitations ; we shall see one explicit example that bears out this expectation later in the paper .    with this simple form of the @xmath3-matrix in hand , we will use the semiclassical techniques of ref  @xcite to analyze dynamical properties of spin fluctuations near @xmath32 and @xmath33 in terms of the motion of the dilute gas of quasiparticles .",
    "we will begin by discussing the properties of the @xmath3-matrix for two - particle scattering in the limit of low momenta in section [ sec : begin ] . in section  [ sec : sigma ]",
    "we consider the @xmath3 matrix for the @xmath4 non - linear sigma model .",
    "this has been computed for all momenta by zamolodchikov and zamolodchikov , and we shall show that the zero momentum limit does indeed satisfy ( [ smatrix ] )",
    ".    however , the @xmath5-model is a continuum theory ; it would be much more satisfactory to be able to directly see that ( [ smatrix ] ) holds for some specific microscopic model , and explicitly verify that lattice effects do not affect the simple structure of this limit .",
    "one such model is the @xmath6 , two - leg heisenberg antiferromagnetic ladder with inter - chain exchange @xmath34 and intra - chain exchange @xmath35 .",
    "the properties of the ladder can be analysed using a ` strong - coupling ' expansion  @xcite in powers of @xmath36 for the microscopic lattice hamiltonian of the system . in section  [ zerot ]",
    "we shall explicitly verify ( [ smatrix ] ) for vanishing velocities in this lattice model within this strong - coupling expansion .",
    "parenthetically , we note that our strong - coupling analysis also allows us to make predictions about interesting features in the @xmath8 dynamic structure factor @xmath37 which are specific to the system considered . in particular , we find that , to second order in @xmath36 , a two - particle @xmath7 bound state gives rise to a _",
    "second _ peak ( in addition to the usual peak coming from the stable single particle excitations of the system ) in @xmath38 for a range of values of @xmath39 around @xmath40 .",
    "this should be of relevence to inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) experiments on the ladder compounds and it is hoped that they experimentally verify the existence of this effect .    in section  [ fuku ]",
    "we study the complementary ` weak - coupling ' expansion in powers of @xmath41 for the two - leg ladder .",
    "as was shown in ref  @xcite , this expansion leads to a description of the low - energy , long - distance properties of the ladder in terms of an effective field theory of a triplet of massive majorana fermions .",
    "the hamiltonian for the majorana fermions also has a four - fermion coupling which has generally been ignored in previous treatments . in the absence of this scattering ,",
    "the majorana fermions are free , and the resulting @xmath3-matrix does _ not _ obey ( [ smatrix ] ) . in this paper , we consider the effect of the four - fermion coupling in perturbation theory . we show that this expansion suffers from severe infra - red problems which have to be resolved by an infinite - order resummation .",
    "the structure of the divergences is very similar to those also present in the large-@xmath42 expansion of the @xmath5-model above , and we find that the resulting resummed @xmath3-matrix of the majorana fermions does indeed obey the analogue of ( [ smatrix ] ) .",
    "so neglecting the four - fermion coupling  @xcite , ( or even treating it in an unresummed manner at finite order in perturbation theory ) is a very bad approximation at low momenta , and we expect that corresponding divergences in the perturbative evaluation of the spin - spin correlation function invalidate the dynamical results of ref  @xcite at low @xmath0 .    in section  [ sec : lowt ]",
    "we shall turn to a discussion of the dynamical properties in the regime @xmath43 .",
    "our results apply universally to all gapped one - dimensional antiferromagnetic systems with spin one quasiparticles ; indeed they rely _ only _ on the dispersion ( [ dispersion ] ) and the @xmath3-matrix in ( [ smatrix ] ) .",
    "all our results will be expressed solely in terms of the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath1 , the temperature , @xmath0 and the external field @xmath44 .    in section  [ finitet ]",
    "we study the dynamics of the staggered component ( with wavevector @xmath39 close to @xmath40 ) of the fluctuations in the spin density .",
    "more precisely , we study the dynamical structure factor @xmath37 for @xmath39 close to @xmath40 . apart from some overall factors ,",
    "this directly gives the ins crosssection at the corresponding values of momentum and energy transfer . at @xmath8 ,",
    "the dynamical structure factor has a sharply defined @xmath45-function peak at @xmath46 for @xmath39 near @xmath40 .",
    "this peak can be thought of as arising from the ballistic propogation of the stable quasiparticle of the system . at non - zero temperatures ,",
    "the peak broadens as the quasiparticle suffers collisions with other thermally excited particles .",
    "the main objective of section  [ finitet ] is to describe the precise lineshape of the quasiparticle peak in the dynamic structure factor for @xmath15 .    in the @xmath5-model approach ,",
    "the staggered components of the spin density are represented by the antiferromagnetic order parameter field @xmath47 .",
    "we will use the semiclassical method of ref-@xcite to calculate the space and time dependent @xmath48-point correlation function of the @xmath47 field for @xmath15 .",
    "this allows us to calculate the thermal broadening of the single particle peak in the dynamical structure factor @xmath38 for wavevectors @xmath39 near @xmath49 .",
    "in particular , we find that the dynamic structure factor in the immediate vicinity of the quasiparticle peak at ( @xmath33 , @xmath50 ) may be written in a reduced scaling form as @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 is the ( non - universal ) quasiparticle amplitude of the spin one excitations of the system , @xmath54 is the typical time spent by a thermally excited quasiparticle between collisions with other particles , and @xmath55 is a _ completely universal _ function that we determine numerically in this paper .",
    "notice that temperature enters this scaling form only through @xmath56 .",
    "we claim , though this is not rigorously established , that these results for the broadening are asymptotically exact for @xmath57 : all corrections to the line - width are expected to be suppressed by positive powers of @xmath58 .",
    "some evidence for the exactness of our results emerges from consideration of simpler systems where exact results for the line - broadening are available from the quantum inverse scattering method  @xcite ; as we shall see in section  [ finitet ] , our semiclassical results are in perfect agreement  @xcite with these .",
    "it is hoped that experimental studies of the temperature dependence of the ins cross - section in this regime will confirm these results , particularly the simple scaling form ( [ scalinspik ] ) .    in section  [ hdep ]",
    "we turn to the correlations of the conserved magnetization density , or dynamic fluctuations near @xmath32 , for @xmath2 . unlike the staggered case ,",
    "the overall magnitude of the magnetization density fluctuations is universal and given by @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the uniform susceptibility of the system ( the non - universal overall scale of the staggered component is reflected for instance by the presence of the overall constant @xmath53 in ( [ scalinspik ] ) ) . in this temperature regime",
    ", we have the well - known result for @xmath60  @xcite : @xmath61 we shall study the dynamics of the magnetization density in section  [ hdep ]  @xcite .",
    "we shall show that the long - time correlations of an effective semiclassical model are characterized by _",
    "spin diffusion _ , and obtain the following result for its low @xmath0 spin - diffusion constant @xmath62 : @xmath63 using the einstein relation for the spin conductivity @xmath64 , we obtain from ( [ chilowt ] ) and ( [ dslowt ] ) @xmath65 notice that the exponentially large factor @xmath66 has dropped out , and @xmath67 diverges with an inverse square - root power in @xmath0 as @xmath68 .",
    "the semiclassical model is possesses an infinite number of local conservation laws : in appendix  [ integrable ] , we discuss how the existence of spin diffusion can be compatible with these local conservation laws .",
    "however , these results do not rigorously allow us to conclude that the ultimate long - time correlations of the underlying gapped quantum spin chain are diffusive .",
    "this has to do with a subtle question of order of limits : we computed the @xmath3 matrix ( [ smatrix ] ) in the limit @xmath29 , and then used it to evaluate the long - time limit of correlations of the magnetization , whereas in reality the limits should be taken in the opposite order .",
    "what we can claim is that our results will apply for all times upto a time scale which is larger than the collision time @xmath56 by a factor which diverges with a positive power of @xmath69 as @xmath68 ; there is a substantial time window in this regime where we have established that the spin correlations are diffusive . for the generic gapped quantum spin chain",
    ", we can reasonably expect that the ultimate long - time correlations are indeed diffusive , and the only consequences of the omitted terms in the @xmath3 matrix are subdominant corrections to the value of @xmath62 in ( [ dslowt ] ) which are suppressed by powers of @xmath58 .",
    "for the continuum nl@xmath5 m with a relativistically invariant regularization ( this is unphysical for any experimental application ) , the issue is a little more subtle : this model does possess additional non - local conserved quantities  @xcite , but we consider it unlikely that these will modify the long time limit  @xcite . on the experimental side , however , diffusive behaviour of the magnetization density has already been convincingly demonstrated in the @xmath7 one - dimensional antiferromagnet agvp@xmath70s@xmath71 by the nmr experiments of takigawa _ et.al . _  @xcite .",
    "as has been argued earlier  @xcite , the dynamic fluctuations near @xmath32 provide the dominant contribution to the nmr relaxation rate @xmath9 for @xmath2 .",
    "thus , knowing the space and time dependent two - point correlation function of the conserved magnetization density , we are able to compute the field and temperature dependent @xmath9 in this regime .",
    "we shall see that the overall scale of @xmath9 is set by the ratio @xmath72 . as was pointed out to us by m. takigawa",
    "@xcite , this immediately leads to an activation gap for @xmath9 given as @xmath73 this difference between the activation gaps for @xmath60 and @xmath9 appears to clear - up puzzling discrepencies in the experimental literature  @xcite for the value of the energy gap in these systems obtained from knight - shift susceptibilty measurements on the one hand , and @xmath9 nmr relaxation rates on the other ; a systematic tabulation of the activation gaps for a large number of gapped spin chains  @xcite does indeed show a trend consistent with ( [ nmrgap ] ) .",
    "the crucial factor of @xmath74 clearly arises from the exponential divergence in @xmath62 .",
    "this diffusive behaviour we find arises entirely from intrinsic inelastic scattering between the quasi - particles . in real systems",
    "there will also be contributions from elastic scattering off inhomogenities which will eventually saturate the divergence of @xmath62 as @xmath68 .",
    "however , because of the strong spin scattering implied by ( [ smatrix ] ) the effects of inelastic scattering is particularly strong in @xmath75 , and can easily dominate inhomogenities in clean samples",
    ".    we will give a detailed account of the calculations leading up to our expression for @xmath9 ( some details on the method used are relegated to appendix  [ jep ] ) and then go on to compare the theoretical predictions for the field dependence of @xmath9 with the extensive experimental data of takigawa _ et.al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "we will see that our results ( _ without _ any adjustable parameters , except for a field independent background rate ) agree with the data extremely well for a range of intermediate temperatures . at the lowest temperatures for which data is available ,",
    "the quality of the fit deteriorates significantly and the @xmath76 divergence predicted at small fields seems to get cutoff , presumably by some spin - dissipation mechanism present in the real system . at the present time , we are unable to incorporate this dissipation in any serious way in our approach . however , following ref  @xcite , we can phenomenologically introduce some spin - dissipation in our results for the long - time limit of the autocorrelation function and obtain a corresponding expression for the field dependence of @xmath9 .",
    "this allows us to fit the data at the lowest temperatures with a phenomenological form that has one additional adjustible parameter corresponding to the spin - dissipation rate .",
    "we also present results for the temperature dependence of this effective rate .",
    "finally , in section  [ hight ] we will turn to the regime @xmath77 .",
    "we will do this in the context of the continuum @xmath4 @xmath5-model only .",
    "any continuum theory is applicable to real lattice experiments only below some energy scale , and a natural choice for this energy scale is a typical exchange constant @xmath78 .",
    "so more specifically , we shall be studying the regime @xmath79 .",
    "for @xmath80 we expect the spins to behave independently , and the system exhibits a curie susceptibility .",
    "it is an open question whether the window of temperatures @xmath79 with universal behavior exists at all in any given system , and the answer will surely depend upon details of the microscopics .",
    "it is unlikely to be present for @xmath7 spin chains , but appears quite possible for @xmath81 spin chains  @xcite .",
    "the static properties of this regime were first studied by joliceour and golinelli  @xcite using the @xmath82 limit of the @xmath83 @xmath5 model of ref  @xcite .",
    "we shall present here an exact treatment of static and dynamic properties for the case of general @xmath83 ; the numerical values of the @xmath84 static results are significantly different from the earlier @xmath82 results .",
    "we shall show that the antiferromagnetic correlations decay with a correlation length @xmath85 , which to leading logarithms in @xmath69 is given at @xmath84 exactly by @xmath86 where @xmath87 is euler s constant .",
    "we also obtain the exact uniform susceptibility @xmath88 ( notice the argument of the logarithm differs slightly from ( [ xihight ] ) ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare the two asymptotic results ( [ chilowt ] ) and ( [ chihight ] ) , and we have done that in fig  [ fig2 ] .",
    "it is reassuring to find that the two results are quite compatible for @xmath89 .",
    "this suggests that one of either the @xmath2 or @xmath77 asymptotics are always appropriate .",
    "we shall also consider the nature of spin transport in the @xmath79 regime , and show that it is related to transport in a certain classical statistical problem of deterministic non - linear waves .",
    "we have not established whether spin diffusion exists or not in this classical problem ; if the correlations were diffusive , however , we are able to precisely predict the @xmath0 dependence of the spin diffusivity : @xmath90^{3/2}}{[3\\chi_{u } ( t)/2]^{1/2}}.\\ ] ] here @xmath91 is an undetermined universal number , and @xmath92 , @xmath93 are given in ( [ xihight],[chihight ] ) .",
    "notice the complementarity in the two @xmath0 regimes discussed above : the description for @xmath2 was in terms of semiclassical particles , while that for @xmath79 is in terms of semiclassical non - linear waves .",
    "the primary purpose of this section will be to establish the @xmath3-matrix by a variety of methods .",
    "we will begin in section  [ sec : sigma ] by using the relativistic @xmath4 @xmath5 model . in section  [ zerot ]",
    "we will consider the strong - coupling expansion of the two - leg ladder in powers of @xmath36 .",
    "this section will also present supplementary results on some interesting features in the @xmath8 ins cross - section of the strongly coupled ladder arising from the presence of a @xmath7 , two - particle bound state in its spectrum . finally , section  [ fuku ] will consider the complementary @xmath41 expansion .",
    "let us begin with a brief review of the @xmath5-model as an effective field theory for the low - energy properties of the gapped systems ( for a more extensive discussion see @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath103 is determined by the underlying lattice antiferromagnet at the momentum scale @xmath104 to be @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the spin at each site in the original lattice system .",
    "the @xmath5-model is used to make statements about physics at length scales @xmath107 and time scales @xmath108 ; this physics is _ universally _ characterized by the dimensionful parameters @xmath21 , @xmath44 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 , the energy gap at @xmath109 . though the magnitude of @xmath1 is determined by non - universal lattice scale quantities ( @xmath110 for small @xmath103 ) , the long distance physics of the @xmath5-model depends on these lattice scale effects only through the value of @xmath111 , and has no direct dependence on @xmath103 or @xmath112 .",
    "also , the energy - momentum dispersion of the stable particle - like excitation of this model is given by @xmath113 , and there is a triplet of them .",
    "the conserved density of this model corresponding to its @xmath114 symmetry is the magnetization density @xmath115 . in the hamiltonian formalism , this is represented by the operator @xmath116 .    finally , to make contact with the lattice antiferromagnet",
    ", we must have a prescription for representing the spin - density operator @xmath117 of the lattice system in terms of the operators of the @xmath5-model .",
    "it is most convenient to do this in terms of fourier components .",
    "we have : @xmath118 ( recall that @xmath119 ) and @xmath120 for @xmath121 , @xmath122 much smaller than some microscopically determined scale @xmath123 .",
    "the missing proportionality constant in the first relation is non - universal and related to the magnitude of the spin at each site in the original lattice system .",
    "thus , the @xmath5-model allows us to represent spin fluctuations near @xmath33 ( these being the low - energy degrees of freedom ) _ and _ near @xmath32 .",
    "this is of course because the @xmath32 component of the spin density is the conserved charge corresponding to the @xmath114 symmetry of the system , and as such must be included in any description of the slow modes .",
    "the exact @xmath3 matrix of the collision of two particles in the @xmath5-model was computed in a seminal paper of zamolodchikov and zamolodchikov . for the scattering event shown in fig  [ fig1 ] it is ( recall @xmath124 are the three possible values of the @xmath4 spin label ) : @xmath125 \\label{smatrix1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath126 is the ` rapidity ' , @xmath127 for @xmath128 , and @xmath4 invariance guarantees a total lack of @xmath44 dependence in the result .",
    "the functions @xmath5 in ( [ smatrix1 ] ) are @xmath129 now notice the structure of the limit @xmath130 which is important for our purposes in the region @xmath2 : we find that @xmath131 , while @xmath132 .",
    "this establishes the key result ( [ smatrix ] ) for this continuum model .      in this section",
    "we concentrate on the properties of a particular model system , the spin-@xmath11 , @xmath48-leg heisenberg antiferromagnetic ladder , to which the low - energy phenomenology of the preceeding section is expected to apply .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system may be written as @xmath133 here , the @xmath134 and @xmath135 are spin-@xmath11 operators at site i along the two chains that make up the ladder , @xmath103 is a dimensionless coupling constant equal to the ratio of the antiferromagnetic bond along the individual chains @xmath136 to the bond along the rungs of the ladder @xmath137 and we have set the bond strength @xmath138 along the rungs to be unity ; this defines our unit of energy .",
    "we will analyze this model in the limit of small @xmath103 ; this ` strong - coupling ' expansion  @xcite is expected to be qualitatively correct for all @xmath103 . for @xmath139",
    ", we just have a system of isolated rungs with the two spins on each rung coupled antiferromagnetically .",
    "the ground state is a product state with each rung in a singlet state .",
    "the lowest lying excited states form a degenerate manifold with precisely one rung promoted to the triplet state .",
    "perturbative corrections in @xmath103 would presumably make this triplet ` particle ' hop around producing a single - particle band of triplet excitations as the lowest lying excited states .",
    "thus we expect that our perturbative analysis will be most conveniently performed in a representation that directly describes the state of _ individual rungs _ of the ladder . with this in mind",
    ", we switch to the ` bond - operator ' formalism introduced in ref  @xcite . following ref  @xcite",
    ", we write the spin operators as : @xmath140 where @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and @xmath87 are vector indices taking the values @xmath96,@xmath143,@xmath144 , repeated indices are summed over , and @xmath145 is the totally antisymmetric tensor . @xmath146 and @xmath147 are respectively creation operators for singlet and triplet bosons at site @xmath148 ( in the previous section we had used @xmath149 to denote the spin density of the lattice system ; here we shall use @xmath150 to denote the same and reserve @xmath151 for the singlet boson operator ) .",
    "the restriction that physical states on a rung are either singlets or triplets leads to the following constraint on the boson occupation numbers at each site : @xmath152 the spin density is given by @xmath153 it is also convenient to define @xmath154 the hamiltonian in terms of these operators is given as @xmath155 where @xmath156 and @xmath157    in this representation , the ground state for @xmath139 is just the state with every site occupied by a singlet boson . to zeroth order in @xmath103 , the lowest excited states form a degenerate manifold with a triplet boson ( of arbitrary polarization ) replacing the singlet particle at precisely one site .",
    "higher excited states also form degenerate manifolds labelled by the number of singlet particles that are replaced by triplet bosons.in what follows , we will describe states by the number ( which can only be zero or one ) and polarization of the triplet particles at each site , the singlet occupation numbers being determined by the constraint .",
    "thus we will loosely refer to the state with no triplet particles as the ` vacuum ' . at this order in @xmath103 , the physical particle - like excitation of the system",
    "is created at site @xmath148 by the action of @xmath158 on the vacuum , and thus coincides with the bare triplet particle . in general at higher orders in @xmath103 , we expect that the physical single particle states of the system will contain an admixture of states with more than one bare particle present .",
    "similarly , the physical vacuum will also have a component with non - zero bare particle number .",
    "in fact , it is quite convenient to make a canonical transformation ( determined order by order in @xmath103 ) to an auxillary problem in which the physical particle states do not contain admixtures of states with different bare particle number .",
    "the hamiltonian of the auxillary problem is related to the original one by a similarity transformation .",
    "the energy eigenvalues obtained in this manner of course give the energy levels of the original hamiltonian .",
    "however , to recover the corresponding wavefunctions , one has to undo the effects of the canonical transformation .",
    "we will use this convenient formulation of perturbation theory below as we discuss the strong - coupling expansion .",
    "the auxillary hamiltonian in this approach is given by @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the hermitian operator that generates our canonical transformation .",
    "we choose @xmath160 to meet the following criteria :    * the matrix elements of @xmath161 between states with differing numbers of bare particles should be zero to a given order in @xmath103 .",
    "note that this implies that the elementary excitations of the auxillary hamiltonian are just the bare particles .",
    "however their dynamics , and their mutual interactions ( in multiparticle sectors ) are determined by the restriction of @xmath161 to the appropriate subspace of definite particle number.this restriction gives the corresponding energy levels of the original hamiltonian @xmath162 correct to that order in @xmath103 .",
    "this then serves as our effective hamiltonian for the corresponding sector of the original problem .",
    "* this does not completely specify @xmath160 .",
    "we therefore also require that @xmath160 have zero matrix elements to a given order in @xmath103 between any two states populated by the same number of bare particles .",
    "these criteria fix @xmath160 uniquely order by order in @xmath103 and in general we have an expansion for @xmath160 that reads : @xmath163  .",
    "it is quite straightforward to use this procedure to generate an expansion in @xmath103 for the effective hamiltonians in the one and two particle sector of the original problem ( the ` effective hamiltonian ' in the physical vacuum sector is just a constant equal to the ground state energy calculated to the relevant order in @xmath103 ) .",
    "solving for the eigenstates and eigenvalues of these effective hamiltonians is just a simple exercise in elementary quantum mechanics .",
    "if the eigenstates of the spin - ladder are of interest ( as they will be when we calculate @xmath37 perturbatively ) , we will have to obtain them from the eigenstates @xmath164 of the effective hamiltonian using @xmath165    after this preamble , we turn to the actual calculations . as we have mentioned earlier , the scattering matrix in the low - energy limit is a crucial input to the semiclassical calculations at non - zero temperature , and it is therefore interesting to have results for it in our microscopic model .",
    "so , to begin with , let us look at the two - particle sector and work out the scattering properties of the physical particles .",
    "first we need to find the effective hamiltonian for the two - particle sector .",
    "to first order in @xmath103 , this is just given by the restriction of @xmath166 to the two particle subspace .",
    "instead of introducing a lot of cumbersome notation to write this down , we will just list the amplitudes of the various processes that are allowed in this two body problem :    * each particle can hop one site to the left or the right with amplitude @xmath167 except when the neighbouring site in question is occupied by the other particle .",
    "* when the two particles are at neighbouring sites , there is a non - zero amplitude for spin rotation .",
    "consider the state @xmath168 which has one particle at @xmath148 with polarization @xmath169 ( which can be any one of @xmath96,@xmath143,@xmath144 ) and another particle at @xmath170 with polarization @xmath171 .",
    "the amplitude to make a transition from this to the state is  .    to solve for the scattering states of this two - body problem , it is more convenient to work in a basis in which we label the spin part of the two particle states by the total angular momentum @xmath78 and the value of its @xmath144 component @xmath172 .",
    "the spin rotation amplitude now becomes just a @xmath78 dependent nearest neighbour potential which takes the values @xmath167 , @xmath173 , and @xmath174 for @xmath175 ,  @xmath14 ,  and @xmath176 respectively .",
    "note that the potential energy is independent of @xmath172 as one would expect from rotational invariance .",
    "it is now quite simple to find the scattering eigenstates in each channel .",
    "the spatial wavefunction in channel @xmath78 may be written as @xmath177 where @xmath178 is the symmetrizing operator for @xmath175 ,  @xmath176 and the antisymmetrizing operator for @xmath179 , and @xmath180 is the reflection coefficient that completely specifies the scattering properties of the particles .",
    "for the @xmath180 we have : @xmath181 where @xmath182  , @xmath183  , and @xmath20 is the lattice spacing along the length of either of the two chains that make up the ladder system .",
    "note that @xmath184 and @xmath185 both range over the interval @xmath186 .",
    "the energy of the scattering state labelled by @xmath187 ( the energy of the ground state being set to zero ) is given by @xmath188 this is consistent with the first order result  @xcite for the single particle dispersion relation :  @xmath189 .",
    "the next step is to use these results for the reflection coefficients to obtain the @xmath3-matrix for this two - body problem in the limit of low velocities .",
    "low velocities imply values of @xmath190 and @xmath191 in the vicinity of the band minimum at @xmath192 , i.e @xmath17 close to zero and @xmath193 close to @xmath194 . both @xmath195 and @xmath196 have the limiting value @xmath197 as @xmath198 ,  @xmath199 .",
    "however , @xmath200 is singular in the vicinity of @xmath201 , @xmath202 ; its value depends on the order in which the two limits @xmath198 and @xmath199 are taken .",
    "this is somewhat disconcerting as we expect a well - defined low - velocity limit which agrees with the predictions of the @xmath4 nl@xmath5 m field theory .    to identify the source of our problem ,",
    "let us look more closely at the expression for @xmath203 .",
    "we notice that @xmath203 , considered a function of the complex variable @xmath17 , has a pole in the upper half - plane for a range of values of @xmath193 .",
    "this indicates the presence of a bound state in the @xmath204 channel for the corresponding values of @xmath193 .",
    "this bound state hits threshold , i.e its binding energy goes to zero , as @xmath205 .",
    "it is the presence of a bound state at threshold that causes the singular behaviour of the reflection coefficient in the limit @xmath198 ,  @xmath199 . clearly , if there were a range of @xmath193 around @xmath194 for which there was no singlet bound state , then we would not have this difficulty .",
    "it turns out ( as we shall briefly outline later ) that extending our calculation to the next order in @xmath103 leads us to precisely this conclusion and gives a well - defined limiting value of @xmath197 for @xmath203 as @xmath198 ,  @xmath199 .",
    "this result can now be used to obtain the @xmath3-matrix of our auxillary two - body problem .",
    "we are interested , however , in the @xmath3-matrix that describes the scattering of the physical particle - like excitations of the spin - ladder .",
    "thankfully , it is quite easy to see that though the wavefunctions of the two problems are related by a canonical transformation , the purely ` off - diagonal ' form of @xmath160 implies that the two are the same at least to first order in @xmath103 . transforming to the basis used in ( [ smatrix ] ) ,",
    "we see that the @xmath3-matrix in the low velocity limit is indeed given by  ( [ smatrix ] ) thus , this super - universal form of the @xmath3-matrix holds for our lattice model and lends support to the idea that it is a generally valid consequence of just the slow motion of the particles and is in no way dependent on the special properties of the continuum @xmath5-model .    to wind up this part of our discussion ,",
    "let us now summarize the calculation of the reflection coefficients to first order in @xmath103 .",
    "we need to find the effective hamiltonian of our auxillary two - body problem to second order in @xmath103 .",
    "this involves first working out @xmath206 and then using this to obtain the effective two - body hamiltonian . to @xmath207 , we generate in this manner an additional next - nearest neighbour hopping term and some additional @xmath78 dependent nearest - neighbour interactions .",
    "we skip the details as they are somewhat tedious and not particularly illuminating .",
    "the @xmath204 reflection coefficient ( correct to @xmath208 ) obtained in this manner is given as : @xmath209 from this , it is easy to see that there is no pole in the upper half @xmath17-plane as long as @xmath210 .",
    "this means that there is no singlet bound state possible in this range of @xmath193 .",
    "this is consistent with our expectation that at the very lowest energies , the two - particle spectrum should be free of bound states in order to match the predictions of the @xmath5-model .",
    "moreover , ( [ r0 g ] ) has a well - defined low - velocity limit of @xmath197 as claimed earlier .",
    "the foregoing analysis has shown that the two particle sector has a spin @xmath211 bound state which leads to some interesting threshold singularities for the scattering matrix .",
    "examining our expressions for the reflection coefficients , we notice that there is in fact a bound state in the @xmath7 channel as well ( actually , there is also a @xmath81 anti - bound state ; we will not delve further into that aspect of the spectrum here ) .",
    "now , a @xmath7 excited state can have observable consequences for the ins cross - section of a system and we might expect to see some interesting features in the same as a result of this",
    ".    with this motivation , let us turn to the perturbative calculation of the dynamic structure factor at @xmath8 .",
    "we pick a coordinate system in which the two chains that make up our ladder are parallel to the @xmath96 axis and have @xmath143 coordinates of @xmath212 and @xmath213 respectively , where @xmath214 is the distance between them ( for simplicity , we are assuming here that the rungs of the ladder are perpendicular to its legs ) . the spins along a chain",
    "are located at @xmath96 values equal to integer multiples of @xmath20 .",
    "we denote the position of each spin in the @xmath96-@xmath143 plane by @xmath215 .",
    "we define @xmath216  .",
    "the @xmath8 dynamic structure factor may be written as @xmath217 where @xmath218 is the ground state of the system , @xmath219 is the length of each chain , and @xmath220 denotes the spin operator at @xmath215 in the heisenberg representation .",
    "our strategy is to write down the usual spectral representation for ( [ sforladd ] ) and then evaluate it perturbatively .",
    "actually , a complete calculation of the second order contribution would involve the eigenstates with more than two - particles present ; below we will ignore this complication and confine ourselves to calculating the contribution of the one and two - particle sectors , correct to the appropriate order in @xmath103 .",
    "the spin operator at any site is a sum of two terms : a single particle piece coming from the @xmath221 , and a two particle part coming from the spin density operator @xmath222 . from the structure of the strong - coupling expansion ,",
    "it is clear that the single particle part does not have matrix elements between the ground state and any state in the two particle sector ; similarly the two - particle piece does not have matrix elements between the ground state and any state in the single - particle sector .",
    "thus , keeping only the contributions from the one and two particle sectors , we can write to second order in @xmath103 : @xmath223 where @xmath224 and @xmath225 denote one and two particle states respectively , and @xmath226 and @xmath227 denote the discrete fourier transforms of @xmath228 and @xmath229 .",
    "let us digress for a moment and think in terms of the inelastic neutron scattering cross - section for a process with momentum transfer @xmath230 and energy tranfer @xmath231 ; this coincides with the dynamic structure factor apart from some geometrical factors .",
    "this scattering can of course produce a single spin - one particle in the spin system .",
    "but there is also a non - zero amplitude for producing a pair of these particles close to each other ( as is clear from the actual calculations described later ) .",
    "this is the origin of the second term in ( [ spectralform ] ) .",
    "now , these two pieces contribute to the structure factor over very distinct intervals along the frequency axis .",
    "while it is in principle possible to calculate both terms correct to @xmath207 , we will confine ourselves below to calculating the leading perturbative correction for each value of @xmath231 .",
    "thus , we will calculate the single particle piece only to first order in @xmath103 , while doing a full second order calculation for the two - particle piece .",
    "below , we give a brief outline of the calculation and then discuss our final results .    to calculate the single particle piece , we first need to determine the ground state and the physical one - particle state wavefunctions correct to @xmath208 .",
    "this involves using @xmath160 correct to first order to obtain the physical wavefunctions from the wavefunctions of the corresponding auxillary problem ( for the one - particle sector , these are just plane waves to all orders in @xmath103 ; this follows from translational invariance ) .",
    "a simple calculation then gives the one - particle piece as @xmath232 where @xmath233 .",
    "turning to the two - particle piece , we see that one can actually ignore the distinction between the physical @xmath48-particle wavefunction and the wavefunction of the auxillary two - body problem",
    ". moreover , it suffices to consider the auxillary problem to first order in @xmath103 . also , since the ground state has spin zero and we are looking at the matrix elements of a vector operator , we need to consider only the triplet ( @xmath179 ) channel of the auxillary problem .",
    "the only subtlety lies in the fact that we need to consider the bound state contribution as well as the usual contribution of the scattering states . from ( [ r1 ] )",
    ", we see that this bound state exists for @xmath234 and for @xmath235 ( remember @xmath193 ranges from @xmath176 to @xmath236 ) .",
    "thinking in terms of an inelastic neutron scattering event with momentum transfer @xmath237 in the fundamental domain ( @xmath176 , @xmath194 ) , we see that this bound state can be excited for @xmath238 _ and _ for @xmath239 . in the latter case",
    ", momentum is conserved modulo a reciprocal lattice vector of @xmath194 .",
    "of course , in addition to the bound state contribution there is a background term coming from the scattering states in this channel .",
    "again , the two particles can be created in the scattering state either with total momentum @xmath193 equal to the momentum transfer @xmath237 , or with the two differing by a reciprocal lattice vector of @xmath194 .",
    "the actual calculations are quite elementary and we proceed directly to the results for the two - particle contributions . the bound state contribution for @xmath240 may be written as : @xmath241 where @xmath242  .",
    "on the other hand , the scattering states give rise to the following background contribution for @xmath243  : @xmath244 note that for @xmath245  or  @xmath246 , there is a square - root divergence at the lower threshold to the continuum in @xmath231 ; these are precisely the values of @xmath237 for which the binding energy of the triplet bound - state goes to zero .",
    "this enhanced scattering can thus be thought of as arising from the presence of the triplet bound state at threshold .",
    "the salient features of these results are summarized in fig  [ fig3 ] and fig  [ fig4 ] .",
    "fig  [ fig3 ] is a plot of the positions along the @xmath231 axis of the single particle peak , the bound state peak , and the bottom of the two - particle continuum as a function of @xmath237 . in fig  [ fig4 ] , we show the spectral weight in the single particle and bound state peaks as a function of @xmath237 .    thus , we see that that the existence of a triplet bound state of two elementary spin - one excitations leads to some interesting features in the dynamic structure factor . actually , qualitatively similar features , again arising from a triplet bound - state , had been predicted earlier  @xcite in the alternating one - dimensional heisenberg antiferromangnetic chain .",
    "recent ins experiments  @xcite on @xmath247vo)@xmath70p@xmath70o@xmath248 do indeed see a second sharply defined peak in the dynamical structure factor for a range of values of @xmath237 .",
    "while this compound had been previously thought to be a good example of a spin - ladder  @xcite , more recent work  @xcite has favoured the alternating chain model  @xcite and the ins results have been interpreted  @xcite in terms of the additional bound state contribution predicted in ref  @xcite . thus , our results may not be of direct relevance to this particular experimental system .",
    "however , our work does predict that a second peak in the ins cross - section should be seen in strongly coupled ladder systems and it is quite possible that the feature persists to all orders in the perturbation expansion we have employed . it would be interesting to confirm this effect by looking at other systems that are more convincingly modelled by a simple ladder hamiltonian and it is hoped that future experiments do indeed see the effects coming from the bound state .      in this section",
    ", we analyze the ladder system ( [ 2legham ] ) in the complementary weak - coupling limit : @xmath249 . an elegant mapping developed by shelton _",
    "_  @xcite allows one to express the low - energy , long - distance properties of the model in terms of a continuum theory of weakly - interacting massive majorana ( real ) fermions .",
    "we will analyze the low - energy scattering properties of the spin one excitations of the weakly - coupled ladder by working in this majorana fermion representation .",
    "we begin with a brief review of the majorana fermion representation .",
    "we will not attempt here to describe in any detail the procedure used  @xcite to arrive at this field - theoretic representation .",
    "instead , we will be content with a rather telegraphic summary of the principal steps involved . to begin with",
    ", one writes down the usual , free , massless bosonic theory  @xcite for the low - energy properties of each of the two @xmath6 heisenberg antiferromagnetic chains that make up the ladder .",
    "the interchain exchange @xmath35 is then turned on , introducing a local , isotropic ( in spin space ) coupling between the spin - density operators of each chain in the bosonic representation .",
    "this has two pieces to it : one coupling the staggered parts of the spin densities with each other and the other doing the same for the uniform component .",
    "now , one works with symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of the two boson fields ( one for each chain ) and transcribes everything to a fermionic representation , introducing one dirac fermion for the symmetric combination and another for the antisymmetric combination in the usual manner ( for a readable account of the relevant machinery of abelian bosonization , see for instance the review  @xcite by shankar ) .",
    "the last step is to write each dirac fermion as two majorana fermions . if one leaves out the uniform part of the coupling to begin with , the theory in terms of the majorana fermions is , remarkably enough , a free - field theory .",
    "the staggered part of the coupling just provides a mass @xmath1 to each of the two majorana fermions obtained from the symmetric combination of the bosons , while the two majorana fermions obtained from the antisymmetric combination acquire masses @xmath1 and@xmath250 respectively ( the actual energy gap is given by the absolute value of the mass ) .",
    "the three majorana fermions with mass @xmath1 form the spin one triplet we expect on general grounds , and the fourth majorana fermion represents a high - energy singlet mode that will not be very important for our purposes .",
    "the mass parameter @xmath1 of the theory is proportional to @xmath35 with the proportionality constant being non - universal .",
    "finally , turning on the coupling between the uniform part of the spin densities gives us a four - fermion interaction term between these massive majorana fermions which will play a crucial role in our analysis of the @xmath3-matrix .",
    "the procedure outlined above gives us the following hamiltonian for the effective field theory written in terms of majorana fermions : @xmath251 here the @xmath252 and @xmath253 are majorana fermion fields with anticommutation relations given as @xmath254 with all other anticommutators being equal to zero , @xmath255 is defined in general as @xmath256 with @xmath257 and the interaction term @xmath258 may be written as @xmath259 with @xmath260 .",
    "note that each majorana fermion is a two component object , the two components being labelled with the subscripts @xmath261 and @xmath219 to denote the ` right - moving ' and ` left - moving ' parts . to make contact with the original spin - ladder",
    ", we also need a prescription for expressing the spin - operators of the ladder in terms of the majorana fermions . in sharp contrast to the @xmath5-model , _ only _",
    "the uniform part of the spin - density operator has a local representation in terms of the fermions ; the components of the spin - density near @xmath33 can be expressed only in terms of _ highly non - local _ functions of the fermi - fields  @xcite .",
    "we have the following expressions  @xcite for the uniform parts , @xmath262 and @xmath263 , of the spin density on each chain : @xmath264 where the index @xmath265 takes on values @xmath261 or @xmath219 and repeated indices are summed over .",
    "note that the field @xmath253 corresponding to the non - universal high - energy singlet mode drops out of the expression for the uniform part of the total spin - density of the ladder which can then be expressed entirely in terms of the spin one triplet fields",
    ".    we shall find it convenient , when it comes to actually doing any calculations , to rewrite all of the foregoing in terms of fermionic creation and annihilation operators .",
    "these are defined as follows : let @xmath266 and @xmath267 denote the fourier transforms of @xmath268 and @xmath269 respectively . we write @xmath270 where @xmath271 and @xmath272 are the fermionic annihilation operators corresponding to the triplet and singlet modes respectively and @xmath273 and @xmath274 are complex - valued functions of @xmath275 which we specify below .",
    "these creation and annihilation operators obey the usual anticommutation relations : @xmath276 with all other anticommutators equal to zero . in terms of these operators ,",
    "the non - interacting part of the hamiltonian reads @xmath277 where @xmath278 , @xmath279 , and the repeated index @xmath20 is summed over . the functions @xmath280 and @xmath281",
    "are actually chosen to ensure that the non - interacting hamiltonian has this simple diagonal form in terms of the creation and annihilation operators ; this choice guarantees that the operators @xmath282 and @xmath283 , as defined in ( [ defsandt ] ) , create the true quasiparticles of the non - interacting system .",
    "the expressions for @xmath280 and @xmath281 are best written as follows : @xmath284 here the functions @xmath285 and @xmath286 are defined in general as @xmath287 with the angle @xmath288 being specified by @xmath289 , @xmath290 .",
    "now , we can rewrite the interaction term in normal ordered form with respect to these singlet and triplet creation and annihilation operators .",
    "the quadratic terms so generated give the first order correction to the masses of the singlet and triplet modes ( this correction has already been calculated in ref  @xcite by other means ) .",
    "the quartic term left over , has , in addition to the usual , normal - ordered , particle - number conserving piece , other pieces that involve pair creation and destruction .",
    "the full expressions are somewhat messy and we refrain from displaying them here . however , and this is key , we will need only a very simple part ( corresponding to the low momentum limit of the particle - number conserving piece ) of this quartic term for the calculation of the @xmath3-matrix in the low - momentum limit ; our method of writing everything in terms of the creation and annihilation operators has the advantage of identifying and isolating this piece at the very outset . finally , as an aside , we note that the total spin operator of the system may be written in terms of the triplet operators as @xmath291 this confirms that the triplet creation operator @xmath283 does indeed create a single spin one quasiparticle ( with polarization @xmath20 ) of the non - interacting system .    with all of this in mind , let us turn to the analysis of the scattering properties of this model . as we are hoping to calculate the @xmath3-matrix perturbatively in the coupling @xmath103",
    ", it is convenient to write @xmath292 .",
    "the ` transition - matrix '  @xmath293 can then be calculated perturbatively using the standard field - theoretic prescription that relates it to the corresponding amputated , connected green s functions of the theory .",
    "let us make this precise for the case we are interested in : namely , a scattering process in which the initial state consists of two particles , one with momentum @xmath190 and spin polarization @xmath294 , and the other with momentum @xmath191 and spin polarization @xmath295 , and the final state has two particles labelled by @xmath296 and @xmath297 .",
    "note that we are now _ not _ talking about the bare particles of the non - interacting theory , but the actual physical quasiparticle states of the system , correct to the relevant order in the perturbative expansion in @xmath103 .",
    "the corresponding matrix element , @xmath298 , may then be written as @xmath299 where @xmath300 and @xmath301 are the final and initial energies respectively , @xmath302 and @xmath303 are the total momenta in the final and initial states respectively , and @xmath304 is the ` reduced ' matrix element ( with energy and momentum conserving @xmath45 functions removed ) for the process under consideration .",
    "we now specialize to the case @xmath305 , @xmath306 ( @xmath307 ) ; this special case allows us to make our basic point ( regarding the infrared divergences present in a perturbative calculation of the scattering properties ) while keeping the calculations simple . in this case , we may decompose the scattering matrix as follows : @xmath308~. \\label{decomps}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , energy and momentum conservation in one dimension provide enough constraints on the two - body problem to ensure that the allowed final states have the same set of momentum labels as the initial state .",

    "we of course introduce additional kinematic factors coming from the jacobian ( we are basically using @xmath312  ) . using this ,",

    "according to this standard field theoretic prescription  @xcite , @xmath318 is proportional to the sum of all ` amputated ' ( factors corresponding to external legs omitted ) , fully connected , one particle irreducible diagrams contributing to the time ordered four - point function with two incoming external lines and two outgoing external lines .",
    "the incoming lines must carry momenta @xmath190 and @xmath191 , frequencies @xmath319 and @xmath320 set to their respective ` on - shell ' values of @xmath321 and @xmath322 , and spin labels @xmath294 and @xmath295 respectively .",

    "before we set about calculating @xmath327 , we need to specify our conventions regarding the diagrammatic representation of perturbation theory .",

    "it turns out that we do not need to consider any diagrams that have lines corresponding to singlet particles and we will not bother to introduce a diagrammatic representation for their propogator .",
    "we also display our diagram convention for the four point vertices of the theory in the same figure ; again , only the particle number conserving vertices in which all four lines involved correspond to triplet particles have been assigned a diagram as the others will not play a role in what follows .",
    "one type of vertex , labelled ( a ) in fig  [ fig5 ] , depicts a process in which two particles of momentum @xmath333 and @xmath334 , both with spin label @xmath335 scatter into a final state populated by two particles with momenta @xmath336 and @xmath337 , and spin label @xmath338 .",
    "the full momentum dependent factor associated with this diagram is also shown below it .",
    "we will need only a very simple low - momentum limit of this expression in most of what follows .",
    "the other kind of vertex , labelled ( b ) in fig  [ fig5 ] , shows incoming particles with labels @xmath339 and @xmath340 scattering into a final state populated by particles with labels @xmath341 and @xmath342 respectively .",
    "again , the full momentum dependent factor is displayed alongside for completeness .",
    "we will mostly need only the value of this factor when all four momenta equal zero ; this is given simply by @xmath343 .",

    "we begin by noting that , apart from the overall factor of @xmath344 which we are ignoring for now , @xmath345 , @xmath346 and @xmath347 are equal to @xmath348  , @xmath349  , and @xmath350   respectively .",

    "the diagrams contributing to @xmath351is shown in fig  [ fig6 ] , while those contributing to @xmath352 and @xmath353 are shown in fig  [ fig7 ] . evaluating these ` tree - level ' amplitudes , we obtain @xmath354 as long as we are interested in only the first order result for @xmath3 , we can set @xmath355 and directly use these expressions to get the following results for the leading low @xmath17 behaviour of @xmath356 , @xmath357 , and @xmath358 correct to first order in @xmath103 : @xmath359 we immediately see that the perturbative expansion can not be trusted in the low - momentum limit because of the infrared divergences present in the expressions for @xmath357 and @xmath358 .",
    "the structure of this first order result is seen to be qualitatively similar to the @xmath360 result for the two - particle @xmath3-matrix of the @xmath83 @xmath5-model  @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "we know that the exact value of the @xmath3-matrix is perfectly well - behaved in the @xmath361 limit and is in fact given by the super - universal expression ( [ smatrix ] ) . to obtain the correct result in this limit for our problem",
    ", we need to identify the _ leading _ infrared divergences at _ each order in _ @xmath103 and perform a resummation .",
    "now , we do not expect any infrared divergences in the perturbation expansion of @xmath329 and as a result the prefactor of @xmath344 in the expression for @xmath304 does not contribute at all to the terms that need to be resummed ; we will forget about this factor from now on .",
    "let us now try and identify the leading infrared divergent diagrams at each order in perturbation theory .",
    "first of all , it is clear , purely from frequency and momentum conservation at each vertex , that no diagrams involving pair creation or annihilation can provide the leading divergence at any order .",
    "moreover , only internal loops in which both propogators involved point in the same direction give a nonzero result on doing the integral over the frequency running through the loop . a little thought should convince the reader that these two constraints allow us to conclude that the ladder series shown in fig  [ fig8 ] give the leading infrared divergent terms in @xmath357 and @xmath358 to all orders in @xmath103 . turning our attention to @xmath356 ,",
    "we see immediately that fermi statistics guarantees that each vertex in the analogous ladder series for @xmath356 has enough factors of momentum associated with it to rule out any infrared divergence appearing in @xmath356 .",
    "our task is thus reduced to evaluating the two series shown in fig  [ fig8 ] . to do this",
    ", we note that as far as the coefficient of the divergent piece is concerned , we can ignore the momentum dependence of each vertex and simply replace it with a factor of @xmath343 .",
    "each crossing of the fermion propogators gives a factor of @xmath197 and each loop integral gives @xmath362 .",
    "putting all this together and summing the resultant geometric series , we obtain the following _ non - perturbative _ results for the low momentum behaviour of @xmath357 and @xmath358 : @xmath363 an interesting feature of these results is the pole in the upper - half @xmath17 plane at @xmath364 which seems to suggest the presence of a bound state .",
    "however , this region of @xmath17 space is definitely beyond the domain of validity of ( [ resum12 ] ) and it is not clear what significance , if any , to ascribe to this curious fact .    turning to firmer ground , we see that the foregoing implies that the low - momentum limit of the two particle @xmath3-matrix is perfectly well - defined and is in fact given by @xmath365 note that apart from an overall factor of minus one , this is exactly the super - universal form ( [ smatrix ] ) .",
    "the relative sign is simply a consequence of fermi statistics and our choice of phase for the final state of the scattering process . in any case",
    ", we will see that when we use the super - universal form of the @xmath3-matrix for discussing spin transport , the overall phase is immaterial . on the other hand ,",
    "the overall factor of @xmath197 in the superuniversal form ( [ smatrix ] ) will be crucial when we work out the correlators of the staggered component of the magnetization density .",
    "this may seem worrisome at first sight .",
    "however , as we do not have any local representation of the staggered component of the spin density in terms of the majorana fermion operators , there is no contradiction at all .",
    "in fact , the semiclassical techniques used in section  [ finitet ] may also be applied to the problem of calculating the finite temperature green function of the fermions ; this would correspond to calculating the finite temperature correlators of some _ highly non - local _ string operators of the original spin system .",
    "however , as it is difficult to see how these may be accessible at all to any experimental probes , we do not pursue this line of thought any further .",
    "thus , we see that the low - momentum behaviour of the @xmath3-matrix in this fermionic representation of the weakly - coupled ladder is consistent with the super - universal form ( [ smatrix ] ) , although this behaviour is definitely not accessible to perturbation theory .",
    "this leads us to believe that similar infrared divergences would invalidate any perturbative calculation of dynamical properties at finite temperature ( when there will be a dilute gas of thermally excited particles present ) that uses this representation .",
    "in particular , this appears to indicate that the results of ref  @xcite for the nmr relaxation rate @xmath9 are incorrect at low @xmath15 .",

    "it is not hard to analyze the properties of this model in a large @xmath103 , strong coupling expansion ; moreover this is expected to be qualitatively correct for all @xmath103 in one dimension  @xcite .",

    "for our lorentz invariant continuum model , @xmath387 where @xmath53 is a non - universal quasiparticle residue .",
    "this gives @xmath388 , with @xmath389 the modified bessel function .",
    "now let us evaluate @xmath384 for non - zero temperatures using the semiclassical method of @xcite .",
    "first , it is convenient to switch to operators @xmath390 , @xmath391 and @xmath392 , defined as @xmath393 and @xmath394 @xmath395 is a sum of a creation operator for particles with @xmath144-component of spin @xmath396 equal to @xmath397 and an annihilation operator for particles with @xmath396 equal to @xmath197 .",

    "we begin with an initial state which is populated by thermally excited particles , the density of particles being @xmath402 @xmath403 and their mean spacing being much larger than the thermal de - broglie wavelength @xmath402 @xmath404 .",
    "as argued in @xcite , this means that the particles can be treated semiclassically . in this semiclassical limit",
    "the dominant contribution to the feynman sum comes about when the paths going backward in time are exactly the time - reversed counterparts of those going forward and all particles follow their classical trajectories between collisions  @xcite .",
    "whenever two particles collide , energy and momentum conservation is sufficient to determine the final momenta .",
    "however , one can not entirely ignore quantum effects of the collisions .",
    "the spins of the particles after the collision as well as the phase picked up by the wavefunction of the system as a result of the collision is determined by the quantum mechanical scattering matrix ( @xmath3 ) . for @xmath2 ,",
    "the particles all move very slowly and we need only the super - universal low - momentum limit ( [ smatrix ] ) .",
    "all this leads to the following description of @xmath384 in this asymptotic limit  @xcite : at time @xmath405 we begin with an initial state populated equally ( for @xmath369 ) with three species ( corresponding to the three values of spin projection @xmath396 ) of particles each uniformly distributed in space with density @xmath406 , where the total density @xmath253 is given as @xmath407 the velocities are distributed according to the classical maxwell - boltzmann distribution function @xmath408 each particle in the initial state is assigned one of the three values of @xmath396 with equal probability ( assuming @xmath369 ) .",
    "the operator @xmath409 acting on this initial state creates at time @xmath405 one extra particle at @xmath410 with spin value equal to @xmath176 ( the annihilation part of @xmath411 gives a contribution which is exponentially suppressed and is ignored here ) .",
    "these particles follow their classical trajectories forward in time . at every collision",
    ", we pick up a factor of @xmath197 from the @xmath3-matrix . at time @xmath412 , a particle with spin projection of zero is annihilated at @xmath96 by @xmath413 .",
    "the resulting state is then propogated backward in time to @xmath405 and its overlap with the initial state calculated .",
    "@xmath384 is then given by the average of this overlap over the ensemble specified earlier .",
    "a typical example of a space - time configuration of trajectories that leads to a non - zero value for this overlap is shown in fig  [ fig9 ] .",
    "all trajectories in the figure except the dotted line denote space - time paths that are traversed both forward and backward in time .",
    "the dotted line is traversed only forward in time as the particle travelling on it is destroyed at time @xmath412 by @xmath413 .",
    "a little thought convinces one that this overlap is non - zero only when all particles colliding with a particle travelling on the dotted trajectory have the same spin @xmath396 ( equal to zero ) as it does .",
    "moreover , when this condition is satisfied , the value of the overlap is just @xmath414 where @xmath415 is the number of collisions that the dotted trajectory suffers .",
    "the factor of @xmath416 comes from the scattering matrix at each collision between a particle on the dotted trajectory and other particles .",
    "all other collisions occur in pairs ( the second member of the pair coming from the evolution backward in time ) and thus do not contribute any phase factor .",
    "the factor of @xmath383 is just the relativistic amplitude for the propogation of a single particle from @xmath410 at @xmath405 to position @xmath96 at time @xmath412 .",
    "all this implies that we can write @xmath417 which defines the ` relaxation function ' @xmath261 .",
    "for the case where the particle has only _ one _ allowed value of its spin label , @xmath396 , it is possible to compute @xmath418 analytically  @xcite , and the resulting expression ( [ rdefine ] ) then agrees precisely with a computation using very sophisticated quantum inverse scattering method  @xcite : this agreement gives us confidence that the physical approach developed here is asymptotically exact at low temperatures .",
    "let us now turn to the calculation of @xmath261 for the case of interest here .",
    "we begin by writing a formal expression for @xmath261 based on the foregoing semiclassical description .",
    "let @xmath419 be the positions of the thermally excited particles at time @xmath405 .",
    "let @xmath420 be their initial velocities . here",
    "@xmath17 is an index running from @xmath14 to @xmath42 , the total number of particles present in the initial state in a system of size @xmath219 .",
    "we label the initial positions with the convention that @xmath421 for @xmath422 .",
    "let @xmath423 denote the @xmath424 space - time trajectory ( note that this is quite distinct from the position of the @xmath424 particle at time @xmath412 ) .",
    "let @xmath425 denote the spin projection value of the particle travelling along the @xmath424 trajectory at time @xmath412 .",
    "the spin projections are randomly assigned to each particle at time @xmath405 as described earlier and @xmath425 at later times depends on which particle is travelling on the @xmath424 trajectory at any given time .",
    "we have the following expression for @xmath261 : @xmath426 with @xmath427 where @xmath428 and @xmath429 the angular brackets in ( [ rexpress ] ) denote averaging over the ensemble of initial conditions specified earlier .",
    "unfortunately , it does not seem possible to do the ensemble average analytically . using methods of refs  @xcite , it is possible to develop a ` cumulant ' expansion for the logarithm of @xmath261  @xcite .",
    "this expansion , however , is essentially a short time expansion which is not uniformly convergent , and thus not very useful for our purposes as we eventually need to fourier transform @xmath384 .",
    "it is also possible to develop a ` mean - field ' approximation to this classical model that ignores the complicated correlations between the @xmath430 at different times  ( see appendix  [ mf ] ) .",
    "this proves to be reasonably accurate at least for the @xmath431 , though the high - accuracy numerics we describe next show clear deviations from the mean - field results .",
    "so , although we have an asymptotically exact formulation for the non - zero temperature @xmath384 at distances much larger than the thermal de - broglie wavelength and times much larger than @xmath432 , we need to numerically determine the relaxation function @xmath261 to actually calculate anything accurately .",
    "this is what we turn to next .",
    "an important property of @xmath418 , which follows directly from ( [ rexpress ] ) is that it can be written in a scaling form as @xmath433 with @xmath434 and @xmath435 where @xmath436 and @xmath437 thus it is most convenient for the numerics to measure length in units of @xmath438 and time in units of @xmath56 and directly calculate @xmath439 .",
    "we start with a system size of @xmath440 ( in units of @xmath438 ) and impose periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the density in these units is unity and so the initial state is populated by @xmath441 particles with their initial positions drawn from a uniform ensemble .",
    "this system size is large enough that finite - size effects are negligible for our purposes .",
    "each particle is assigned a velocity from the classical thermal ensemble . in these new units",
    "this implies that we choose velocities from the distribution @xmath442 an important advantage of our method is that we do the average over the spin values analytically . to do this",
    ", we note that it is possible to reformulate the calculation of @xmath439 by writing @xmath443 where @xmath444 denotes a given space time configuration of trajectories , the angular brackets denote averages _ only _ over the initial positions and velocities that define this configuration , and @xmath445 is defined as @xmath446 here , @xmath447 is the total number of collisions involving a particle travelling on the dotted trajectory of fig  [ fig9 ] and @xmath448 is the number of _ different _ thermally excited particles that have had collisions with a particle travelling on the dotted trajectory .",
    "now , @xmath449 for all configurations @xmath444 in which the presence of the extra particle ( that starts out on the dotted trajectory ) affects the evolution of the various spin values @xmath425 .",
    "so we might as well forget about the particle travelling on the dotted trajectory and consider an auxillary spacetime diagram that now involves only the thermally excited particles .",
    "we now agree to ignore the spin label on the dotted line of fig  [ fig9 ] ; the dotted line now does @xmath450 denote the trajectory of any particle . in terms of this picture",
    "we can define @xmath447 as the number of times any solid line crosses the dotted line , and @xmath448 as the number of _ different _ thermally excited particles that cross the dotted line .    with this new formulation in hand , calculating @xmath445 reduces to some simple book - keeping that keeps track of these two integers for a given configuration @xmath444 .",
    "we implement the ensemble average by averaging over @xmath451 configurations drawn from the appropriate distribution . the combined absolute error ( statistical and finite - size ) in @xmath452 for values of @xmath453 ,  @xmath454 of interest to us is estimated to be less than about @xmath455 .    with @xmath439 available , it is a simple matter to numerically fourier transform the resulting @xmath384 and obtain the dynamic structure factor @xmath37 .",
    "details of the numerical procedure used are relegated to appendix  [ a ] .",
    "here we only comment on some conceptual issues involved and discuss our results .",
    "there is an important subtlety associated with doing the fourier transform that needs to be first addressed . as discussed in ref  @xcite , the semiclassical result for @xmath384 is valid as long as both @xmath96 and @xmath412 are not very small ; the results break down when @xmath456 and @xmath457 ( @xmath458 being the thermal de - broglie wavelength ) .",
    "however , the fourier transform of @xmath459 ( at wavevector @xmath371 ) is an asymptotically valid approximation to @xmath37 _ only _ for @xmath231 close to @xmath460 .",
    "the reason for this can be understood by noting that the long - time asymptotics of our form for @xmath384 have an oscillatory character with oscillations on the scale of @xmath461 .",
    "put another way , it is the spectral weight in the one - particle peak that plays a dominant role in determining the long - time , large - distance asymptotics of @xmath384 and so we can learn only about this feature in the spectral weight by fourier transforming our form for @xmath459 .    with this caveat in mind , we have @xmath462 where @xmath371 .",
    "we have not attempted to exhaustively map out @xmath37 , although it would be quite straightforward to get more extensive numerical results should they be of interest in some experimental context . below",
    "we confine ourselves to discussing our results for @xmath37 for a couple of sample values of @xmath39 .",
    "fig  [ fig10 ] shows scans in frequency across the quasiparticle peak in @xmath37 for @xmath33 at four different values of temperature .",
    "it is interesting to note that when rescaled by @xmath56 and plotted against a rescaled frequency variable @xmath463 , the three curves for @xmath464 , @xmath465 , and @xmath466 seem to collapse on top of one another within our numerical errors ( which are conservatively estimated to be a few percent at the most ) . in fig  [ fig11 ] , we show a scan in wavevector across the same peak for @xmath467 , again at the same four values of temperature .",
    "the curves at the lower temperatures again show scaling collapse ; when rescaled by @xmath56 and plotted against the rescaled variable @xmath468 , they seem to all fall on top of one another .",
    "moreover , the scaling curve in fig  [ fig11 ] , when plotted as a function of the independent variable @xmath469 coincides within our numerical error with the scaling function of fig  [ fig10 ] for @xmath470 ; this is displayed in fig  [ fig12 ] . while we do not have any reason to expect that this scaling is generally true , all three observations may be put together in terms of a scaling form that is valid _ locally _ in the neighbourhood of the quasiparticle peak for @xmath33 ; more formally we write @xmath471    we also investigated @xmath37 in the vicinity of the quasiparticle peak corresponding to @xmath472 ; for this to be meaningful , we of course need @xmath473 to be much less than the microscopic scale @xmath474 beyond which our continuum theory does not work .",
    "we again tried to check if the analogous scaling form , @xmath475 is approximately valid .",
    "fig  [ fig13 ] shows scans in frequency across the peak with @xmath17 held fixed at @xmath473 , for @xmath476 , @xmath381 , @xmath465 , and @xmath466 .",
    "we see that the curves do not really appear to scale . in fig  [ fig14 ] , we show scans in wavevector , with @xmath231 held fixed equal to @xmath477 for the same values of the ratio @xmath69 .",
    "we plot the data ( rescaled by @xmath56 ) against the rescaled variable @xmath478 ( note the difference in the choice of rescaling of the independent variable from the earlier case ) . again , in sharp contrast to the @xmath479 peak , we see that the curves do not show any signs of scaling ; our local scaling form is not a very good way of organizing the data in this case .",
    "these scaling properties are best understood as follows : imagine developing @xmath418 in an expansion about @xmath410 for constant @xmath412 and then calculating the fourier integral in ( [ broads ] ) .",
    "the zeroth order term clearly gives us a result for @xmath37 which is compatible with the scaling form we have postulated for asymptotically low temperatures .",
    "however , before we can trust this result , we need to check that the corrections to the leading behaviour go to zero in the limit @xmath480 .",
    "this is where the difference between the two peaks we looked at becomes apparent .",
    "it is easy to see that this is true only for values of @xmath39 such that @xmath481 as @xmath68 and this explains why the scaling form ( [ scale1 ] ) does not work .",
    "now consider the peak at @xmath33 : the zeroth order scaling result has most of its weight in the region @xmath482 .",
    "for @xmath483 , the corrections to this leading result do indeed go to zero and this establishes the scaling form ( [ scale0 ] ) .",
    "an interesting feature of this result is that the scaling function @xmath55 is _ completely determined _ by the @xmath410 part @xmath431 of the relaxation function .",
    "more precisely , we have @xmath484 a useful check on all of our calculations is thus to compare the scaling function obtained in fig  [ fig10 ] and fig  [ fig12 ] with ( [ dirscalfn ] ) evaluated numerically ( it is possible to do this to a high accuracy ; details may be found in appendix  [ a ] ) .",
    "the results of such a comparison are shown in fig  [ fig15 ] and the agreement is seen to be quite good . while the numerical results for @xmath431 show a clear deviation from the simple exponential decay predicted by the ` mean - field ' theory referred to earlier , we do find that the corresponding simple lorentzian form for the fourier transform : @xmath485 ( with @xmath486 ) provides an excellent approximation to the line - shape ( the ` mean - field ' theory , however , gives a value of @xmath487 for @xmath141see appendix  [ mf ] ) .",
    "we thus have results for the thermally broadened quasiparticle peak in @xmath37 ; the accuracy of these in the asymptotic regime ( @xmath2 ) is limited only by the computer time spent in numerically evaluating the relaxation function and doing the fourier transform .",
    "these results , especially the scaling properties in the vicinity of the peak corresponding to @xmath33 , should be of relevance to neutron scattering experiments on gapped one - dimensional heisenberg antiferromagnets performed at temperatures @xmath2 and it is hoped that this study provides a useful paradigm for organizing the experimental results .      in this section , we shall present a detailed comparison of our results  @xcite for the field ( @xmath44 ) and temperature ( @xmath0 ) dependence of the nmr relaxation rate @xmath9 ( in the regime @xmath0 ,  @xmath488 ) with the experimental data of ref  @xcite on the nmr relaxation rate in the compound agvp@xmath70s@xmath71 which is thought to be a @xmath7 one - dimensional antiferromagnet with a large gap @xmath489 k and single - ion anisotropy energy of about @xmath490 k  @xcite .",

    "let us begin with a detailed review of the calculations leading up to our expression for @xmath9 .",

    "it must be noted that the result ( [ diffres ] ) does not imply that we have rigorously established that the ultimate long - time corelations of the quantum model are also diffusive : the reasons for this and related comments were made earlier in section  [ intro ] below ( [ dslowt ] ) .",
    "let us now summarize the calculation of the correlator of the transverse components of the magnetization density .",

    "@xmath541 _ lowers the spin of precisely the particle whose spin was raised by _",
    "lastly , we see that there is an overall factor of @xmath542 coming from the unitary time evolution as the total spin of the state during its evolution forward in time is greater than the total spin during its evolution backward in time by precisely one .",

    "we have to address an important subtlety that arises in calculating the local dynamic structure factor from the autocorrelation function .",
    "we are treating the spin dynamics semiclassically to arrive at our expressions for the correlation functions .",

    "our semiclassical expressions for the correlation functions do not make sense for very short times .",
    "this is natural as our whole approach has been geared towards calculating these correlations at time scales much larger than @xmath550 and length scales much larger than the thermal de broglie wavelength ; our method fails when both these conditions are simultaneously violated  @xcite .",
    "the semiclassical expressions for @xmath551 are thus only valid for @xmath552 where @xmath553 is a short time cutoff @xmath554 . introducing this short time cutoff",
    "will give a well- defined result for @xmath555 at the price of introducing an arbitrary scale @xmath556 ; this does not seem very promising as our results for @xmath557 ( @xmath558 ) will depend sensitively upon @xmath553 except for very small fields such that we are in the collision dominated diffusive regime : @xmath559  ( @xmath560 ) .",
    "note that the range of @xmath44 for which the results are insensitive to the cutoff differs for the transverse components of the local dynamic structure factor because of the overall oscillatory factor of @xmath561 in the corresponding autocorrelation functions ( this factor always dominates as @xmath562 ) .",
    "however , we can still use our approach to compute the @xmath555 .",
    "the point is that , at very short times , the collisions between the thermally excited particles do not matter , and the spin dynamics is ballistic .",
    "this means that @xmath555 , for high frequencies @xmath563 ( such that @xmath563 is much larger than the mean collision rate @xmath564 ) , may be calculated exactly by doing a full quantum calculation for a gas of non - interacting spin - one particles  @xcite .",
    "now , we can expand our semiclassical result ( obtained by using a cutoff @xmath553 ) for @xmath565 and _ match the leading term in this large @xmath44 expansion _ with the _ small @xmath44 limit _",
    "( for @xmath566  ( @xmath567 ) this would be the regime @xmath568  ( @xmath569 ) ) of the quantum calculation of ref  @xcite .",
    "this , then , will uniquely fix @xmath553 and give us results for the @xmath555 that will work reasonably well even for @xmath570 ( though strictly speaking they are valid only in the range @xmath571  ( @xmath569 ) for @xmath566  ( @xmath567 ) ) .",
    "let us now use all of this to make contact with the experimental results of ref  @xcite .",
    "for this particular experimental setup , the expression for @xmath9 simplifies and to a very good approximation we can write  @xcite @xmath587 here the relevant hyperfine coupling constant is known  @xcite to have the value @xmath588 ( note that we have used units such that @xmath24 in our computation of the correlation functions and thus time is being measured in inverse kelvins ) . to begin with , we straightforwardly attempt to fit the field dependent @xmath9 with our results .",
    "we use the values @xmath589 k and @xmath590 ( we are working in units where the lattice constant @xmath20 is set to one ) extracted from the susceptibility data  @xcite . in actual fact , we introduce an additional , _ field - independent _ background rate @xmath591 that we add on to our theoretical result for @xmath9 .",
    "this serves as our fitting parameter ; we choose it at each temperature to achieve the best agreement with the results of ref  @xcite .",
    "we show the resulting fits for @xmath592 , @xmath593 , and @xmath594 k in fig  [ fig16 ] .",
    "we see that the theoretical curves account for the field dependence of @xmath9 _ extremely _ well in this temperature range ( of course the agreement for @xmath592 k should not be taken too seriously as our theory is valid only for temperatures smaller than the gap ) .",
    "in particular , the data seems to clearly exhibit the theoretically predicted @xmath76 divergence at low fields which is a characteristic of diffusive spin dynamics . in fig  [ fig17 ] and fig  [ fig18 ] , we compare the theoretical predictions with the experimental data at @xmath595 , @xmath596 , @xmath597 , @xmath598 , @xmath599 , and @xmath600 k. at these lower temperatures this divergence seems to get cut off below some threshold field and the quality of the fit deteriorates rapidly .",
    "this indicates the presence of some spin - dissipation mechanism which becomes significant at these lower temperatures and rounds off the diffusive @xmath601 divergence in the local dynamic structure factor . both inter - chain coupling and single - ion anisotropy of the intra - chain coupling",
    "are expected to contribute to the spin dissipation rate .",
    "however , we do not have any real theory that can work out the effects of these terms in the hamiltonian on the field and temperature dependence of @xmath9 .",
    "we can only attempt to phenomenologically introduce some spin dissipation in our theoretical results for the spin correlators .",
    "following @xcite , we do this by simply introducing an exponential cutoff to the long - time tail of the autocorrelation function ; thus we write @xmath602 .",
    "it is straightforward , though somewhat tedious to work out the corresponding local dynamic structure factor by doing the fourier transform and we will spare the reader the details .",
    "this now gives us a phenomenological result for @xmath9 with an additional tunable parameter @xmath603 .",
    "we choose this spin - dissipation rate at each temperature to achieve the best fit with the data .",
    "the resulting curves are shown in fig  [ fig19 ] and fig  [ fig20 ] for a few representative temperature values .",
    "we see that it is possible to fit the data moderately well ; discrepencies are however clearly visible and it is not clear how much significance to attach to the sharp increase in @xmath603 as the temperature is lowered .",
    "the quality of our fit seems at first sight to be much worse than the corresponding fit to a purely classical diffusive form employed in ref  @xcite .",
    "however , it is important to note that the phenomenological model of ref  @xcite used the diffusion constant as an additional fitting parameter ; we do not have any such freedom . moreover , both the diffusion constant and the constant background rate extracted from the fit in ref  @xcite take on unphysical values below about @xmath596 k  @xcite .",
    "this is because , at these lower temperatures , we are in the _ ballistic _ regime of spin - transport for a significant portion of the @xmath44 axis and the contribution from the ` free - boson logarithms ' can not be neglected .",
    "as the crossover to the ballistic regime is already incorporated in our form , the present results for the background rate do not suffer from any such obvious problems ( the diffusion constant of course is just given by ( [ diffres ] ) in our approach ) . in fig  [ fig21 ] and fig  [ fig22 ] , we plot the corresponding values of the spin - dissipation rate @xmath87 and the background rate @xmath591 as a function of temperature .",
    "the spin dissipation rate is seen to increase rapidly as the temperature is decreased . on the other hand ,",
    "we see that the temperature dependence of @xmath591 may be fit approximately by an activated form with activation gap close to @xmath604 .",
    "we consider here the possibility that it may be possible to find gapped spin chains which satisfy @xmath606 , where @xmath78 is a typical exchange constant . in this case",
    ", it becomes possible to access a higher temperature regime where a continuum field theory description is possible in the regime @xmath607 .",
    "in particular , we expect that the continuum @xmath5-model to apply in such a regime  @xcite .",
    "it is our hope that such a universal high @xmath0 regime can be experimentally accessed in @xmath81 spin chains  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the study of such a high @xmath0 regime is of importance as matching its results with the @xmath57 theory can , in principle , help us estimate the values of @xmath0 to which the low @xmath0 results can be applied .",
    "an important property of this regime  @xcite is that equal - time two - point correlator of @xmath608 , @xmath609 ( eqn ( [ defc ] ) ) decays at large @xmath96 with a correlation length @xmath610 we will shortly determine the exact values of the prefactor and the argument of the logarithm in ( [ hight1 ] ) . at distances of order or shorter than this correlation length",
    "we may crudely expect that a weak - coupling , spin - wave picture will hold , and excitations will have energy of order or smaller than @xmath611 , which is logarithmically smaller than the thermal energy @xmath0 ; in other words @xmath612 so the occupation number of these spin - wave modes will then be @xmath613 the last occupation number is precisely that appearing in a classical description of thermally excited spin waves , which suggests that a classical _ wave _ description should yield an appropriate picture of the dynamics of this high @xmath0 region .",
    "however , notice that classical thermal effects are only logarithmically preferred , and any predictions of a classical dynamical theory will only be correct to leading logarithms .",
    "having obtained the classical model ( [ 1drot28 ] ) for the equal - time correlations , and the precise value of the coupling @xmath85 in ( [ 1drot37 ] ) , we now turn to an examination of unequal time correlations in the high @xmath0 region @xmath77 .",
    "we employ an approach related to that used in the study of the quantum @xmath5-model in @xmath637 in ref  @xcite in a _ low _",
    "@xmath0 region ; unlike ( [ 1drot28 ] ) , the equal time correlations in @xmath637 were described by a theory that was not ultraviolet finite , and this will lead to significant differences in the analysis and physical properties here . to obtain classical equations of motions we clearly need to extend the classical hamiltonian in ( [ 1drot28 ] ) by including a kinetic energy term , expressed in terms of a canonical conjugate momentum to @xmath608 .",
    "the obvious approach is to take the quantum equations of motion , and to simply treat the variables as @xmath21-number classical degrees of freedom . in particular",
    ", we treat the rotor - angular momentum @xmath219 as a classical variable , and augment the classical hamiltonian by the kinetic energy of rotational motion .",

    "we expand the partition function to quadratic order in @xmath44 , drop all terms proportional to the spatial gradients of @xmath617 or @xmath639 ( these can be shown to be logarithmically subdominant to the terms kept ) , and find that the @xmath44 dependent terms in the free energy density are @xmath641 \\label{1drot38}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] evaluating the expectation values of the @xmath642 fields , and using orthonormality of the vectors @xmath608 , @xmath643 , the expression ( [ 1drot38 ] ) simplifies to @xmath644 \\label{1drot39}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] finally to obtain the susceptibility @xmath60 , we have to evaluate the expectation value of the zero frequency field @xmath608 under the partition function ( [ 1drot28 ] ) .",

    "nevertheless , we expect that the simple structure of the @xmath3-matrix in ( [ smatrix ] ) will be retained , as it only depends upon simple dimensional properties of slowly moving particles with a quadratic dispersion .",
    "correlations of the particle density can probably be computed along the semiclassical lines of this paper : one has to deal with a classical gas of particles of different masses and average densities .",
    "the latter problem is considerably more complex than the equal mass case , and there is probably no alternative to numerical simulations .",
    "correlations of the spin operators appear more problematical these will invariable change the labels of the particles when they act , and therefore lead to differences in the labels in the forward and backward trajectories . combined with the complication that the masses of the different particles are different , and so their trajectories will have different velocities , we are faced with what appears to be a very complex problem with quantum and classical effects intertwined .",
    "inter - chain couplings will eventually require us to consider dynamics in two or three dimensions .",
    "if temperatures are low enough that the inter - chain motion is coherent , then we have to consider the @xmath3-matrix for scattering in higher dimensions . in this case",
    "the low - momentum behavior is quite different : in fact the @xmath0-matrix vanishes at low momenta for @xmath672 .",
    "we would then expect all scattering to be dominated by elastic scattering of impurities which would control the behavior of the spin diffusion constant and the quasi - particle broadening . on the other hand , systems with only incoherent hopping between chains",
    "will probably be dominated by the inelastic scattering along the one - dimensional chains , and display behavior qualitatively similar to that discussed in this paper .",

    "the first is the time - reversal symmetry , @xmath685 , under which both spins and velocities change sign : @xmath686 the second is the ` particle - hole ' symmetry @xmath687 , under which only the spins reverse direction : @xmath688 these symmetries will be crucial in our discussion below .",
    "let us now explicitly identify the local conserved quantities of this classical dynamics .",
    "all of the velocities @xmath681 are clearly constants of the motion .",
    "however , we would like to work with locally conserved quantities which can be written as the spatial integrals over local observables , and which are invariant under permutation of the particle labels ; so we define @xmath689 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\sum_{k=1}^{n } v_k^n   \\label{integ1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath690 ( notice @xmath691 , but the result holds after summation over @xmath17 because the set @xmath692 differs from the set @xmath693 only by a renumbering ) .",
    "all the @xmath694 are constants of the motion . similarly , with spins @xmath507 we can define @xmath695 with @xmath696 , as additional locally conserved quantities ( @xmath314 is the spatial integral of @xmath697 in ( [ varrho ] ) , and a similar result holds of @xmath315 ) .",
    "we can now easily work out the signature of the @xmath694 and @xmath698 under the discrete symmetries noted earlier , and tabulate the results : @xmath699    the central quantity in spin transport is the total spin current @xmath700 , which is not a constant of the motion .",
    "it is also given by an integral over a local quantity as @xmath701 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\sum_{j , k=1}^{n } m_j v_k a_{jk } ( t ) , \\label{integ3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath702 is defined to be equal to 1 if particle @xmath703 is on trajectory @xmath17 at time @xmath412 and 0 otherwise ; we will analytically study the function @xmath702 in appendix  [ jep ] , but here we will be satisfied by a numerical simulation . again , as in ( [ integ2a ] ) it is useful to note the signature of @xmath78 under the discrete symmetries : @xmath704 as will become clear shortly , one of the central points of this appendix is that the signatures in ( [ integ3a ] ) differ from all of those of the conserved quantities in ( [ integ2a ] ) .",
    "the current @xmath700 is the sum of @xmath42 random numbers of each sign , and so is expected to be of order @xmath705 for a typical initial condition chosen from the ensemble defined above .",
    "we show the _ deterministic _ time evolution of @xmath700 for one such initial condition for a system of 400 particles in fig  [ fig23 ] : notice that it is rather noisy - looking and repeatedly changes its sign .",
    "also , among the constants of the motion above , we expect @xmath694 with @xmath706 odd and @xmath314 to be of order @xmath705 ( provided @xmath706 is not too large ) , and @xmath694 with @xmath706 even and @xmath315 to be of order @xmath42 for a typical initial condition ; notice that it is only the conserved quantities of order @xmath705 that can distinguish left movers from right movers , or spin up from down .",
    "let us now create a macroscopic spin current ( of order @xmath42 ) in this system .",
    "we do this by hitting the system with a magnetic field gradient impulse at a time @xmath707 , and subsequently setting the field to zero . as a result of the impulse , the velocities of the particles with spin up are assumed to increase by @xmath708 , while those of spin down are assumed to decrease by @xmath708 .",
    "formally , this can be written as @xmath709 immediately after the impulse , @xmath700 will have a macroscopic value @xmath710 the subsequent deterministic time evolution of @xmath700 is also shown in fig  [ fig23 ] : it decays in a few collision times to a value of order @xmath705 and then appears to chaotically oscillate in time ! the basic point is now easy to see . because @xmath507 is as likely to be @xmath397 or @xmath197 , the impulse on any given particle is equally likely to be @xmath711 or @xmath712 .",
    "hence the @xmath694 , with @xmath706 odd , remain of order @xmath705 even after the impulse .",
    "this is simply a manifestation of the fact that the signatures of @xmath78 under @xmath687 and @xmath685 are different from those of the @xmath694 .",
    "a non - zero @xmath78 is therefore not correlated with an induced value of a conserved quantity which could prevent the decay of @xmath78 to non - macroscopic values .",
    "in this appendix we outline the numerical method employed in calculating @xmath37 starting from the numerically determined semiclassical @xmath384 and the procedure used to directly determine the scaling function @xmath713 ( see eqn  ( [ dirscalfn ] ) )    as the numerical determination of @xmath452 is the most time consuming part of the entire procedure , we calculated @xmath439 only at a predetermined grid of points in the @xmath714 plane .",
    "we chose @xmath454 values from @xmath176 to @xmath715 at intervals of @xmath716 .",
    "for each such value of @xmath454 , we chose about @xmath717 points so as to sample @xmath439 as well as possible in the region in which @xmath718 ; this choice was made to reflect the fact that our absolute error in @xmath439 was estimated to be about @xmath719 .",
    "this then defined our grid . at each @xmath454",
    ", we fit @xmath439 as a function of @xmath720 to the form @xmath721 where @xmath722 and @xmath723 .",
    "the rationale behind our choice of the value of @xmath724 is as follows : when @xmath725 , the complicated correlations between the spin labels of a given classical trajectory at different times do not matter and @xmath261 is well approximated by our ` mean - field ' theory ( see appendix  [ mf ] ) .",
    "the mean - field theory in this limit gives @xmath726 and this is what determines our choice of @xmath724 .",
    "the error in the fit was estimated to be roughly the same as the error in the original computation of @xmath439 ; thus we did not lose anything by doing the fit .",
    "having tabulated the fitting parameters for each value of @xmath454 on the grid , we evaluated the spatial fourier transform numerically .",
    "the resulting function of @xmath454 is expected to be smooth as long as @xmath727 is not too large .",
    "more precisely , we do not expect any oscillations on the scale of our grid spacing in @xmath454 as long as @xmath728 .",
    "as we are interested only in @xmath729 , we can safely interpolate the resulting function in @xmath454 . in practice",
    "we use a cubic - spline to do the interpolation .",
    "lastly , we do the @xmath454 integral numerically to obtain @xmath37 .",
    "the accuracy of both numerical integrations is quite high and so we expect that the dominant error in our calculation comes from the interpolation ; this is conservatively estimated to be a few percent at the most for the largest values of @xmath730 .",
    "let us now briefly indicate the procedure used in obtaining the fourier transform of @xmath731 needed for the calculation of the scaling function @xmath713 .",
    "the available data for @xmath731 is fit _",
    "well by the following form : @xmath732 where the choice @xmath733 is again motivated by ` mean - field ' considerations .",
    "it is now a simple matter to do the fourier integral to a very high accuracy using this fit and we estimate the errors involved to be less than @xmath734 at the most .",
    "in this appendix , we shall attempt to give a self - contained account of the method devised by jepsen  @xcite for the calculation of the tagged particle correlations in the classical model introduced in ref  @xcite .",
    "we will try to adhere to the notation and conventions of @xcite as far as possible .",
    "the model is defined as follows : we begin with @xmath42 particles of mass @xmath396 distributed uniformly along a one - dimensional segment of length @xmath219 with periodic boundary conditions ( we will eventually take the thermodynamic limit @xmath735 with @xmath736 fixed to be equal to the density @xmath253 ) . at time @xmath405 each particle is assigned a velocity from the classical thermal ensemble defined by the usual maxwell - boltzmann distribution function @xmath737 .",
    "the subsequent evolution of the system is purely deterministic ; the particles travel without any change in their velocities until they collide with another particle .",
    "every collision is elastic and the particles merely exchange their velocities as a result of the collision .",
    "to begin our analysis , let us label the particles from left to right with an index @xmath148 running from @xmath176 to @xmath738 .",
    "thus the particles are initially at positions @xmath739 such that @xmath740 for @xmath741 .",
    "actually , it is convenient to identify @xmath742 with @xmath148 because of the periodic boundary conditions employed which identify the ends @xmath410 and @xmath743 of the interval .",
    "note that this labelling of the particles is left invariant by the dynamics .",
    "we also label _ trajectories _ ( which follow the straight line defined by @xmath744 on the space - time diagram representing the evolution of the system ) with an index @xmath148 , again with the convention that @xmath745 for @xmath741 ( here @xmath746 is the initial velocity of the @xmath747 particle ) .",
    "let @xmath748 denote the _ position _ of the @xmath747 particle at time @xmath412 .",
    "we wish to calculate the correlator @xmath749 where summation over the repeated index @xmath17 is implied and the angular brackets refer to averaging over the ensemble of initial conditions specified earlier .",
    "let us now consider the quantity @xmath750 , introduced in appendix  [ integrable ] , which is defined to be equal to @xmath14 if particle @xmath703 is on trajectory @xmath17 at time @xmath412 and @xmath176 otherwise .",
    "another useful quantity is the number @xmath751 of ( _ signed _ ) crossings suffered by the @xmath424 trajectory upto time @xmath412 .",
    "every time this trajectory is hit from the left , @xmath751 decreases by @xmath14 and every time it is hit from the right @xmath751 increases by @xmath14 . clearly , @xmath752 for @xmath753 and zero otherwise .",
    "we may probe the dynamics a bit more by defining another quantity @xmath754 which equals @xmath14 if trajectory @xmath755 has crossed trajectory @xmath17 precisely @xmath706 times upto time @xmath412 and zero otherwise . here too , we are talking of _ signed _ crossings ; if trajectory @xmath755 crosses from the left this is a negative crossing and if it crosses from the right it is a positive crossing . clearly @xmath756 has the interpretation of a probability when averaged over any ensemble of initial conditions .",
    "let us also define the corresponding ` generating function ' as @xmath757    the reason for introducing @xmath756 and @xmath758 is that @xmath750 , which is clearly a central quantity of interest , may be very conveniently expressed in terms of @xmath758 as @xmath759 here we are using the convention that @xmath760 .",
    "this is quite easy to check from the defintions of @xmath758 and @xmath702 .",
    "moreover , it is possible to write down a fairly explicit expression for @xmath761 .",
    "this takes a slightly different form depending on whether @xmath755 is greater or less than @xmath17 .",
    "if @xmath762 , we have @xmath763~ , \\label{hgreaterk}\\ ] ] while if @xmath764 , we have @xmath765~. \\label{hlessk}\\ ] ] @xmath766 $ ] used above is defined as : @xmath767 = e^{inu}~ , \\label{definebigs}\\ ] ] where @xmath768 , and @xmath706 is the integer that satisfies @xmath769 . using this definition , we can write the following compact expression for @xmath750 in terms of @xmath106 : @xmath770~. \\label{finala}\\ ] ]    with all this machinery in place , it is a relatively straightforward matter to calculate the correlation function we need .",
    "we begin by explicitly writing out the ensemble averages involved : @xmath771\\left ( \\prod_{l=0}^{n-1 } % % @ g(v_l)\\right)\\delta(x_0(t)-x)~ , \\label{explicitav}\\ ] ] where we have used the definitions @xmath772 and @xmath773 \\equiv   \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}dv_{n-1}\\int_{-%%@ \\infty}^{\\infty}dv_{n-2}\\ldots \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}dv_{0}~$ ] with @xmath774 , and it is understood that @xmath775 is set equal to @xmath176 when evaluating the right hand side of ( [ explicitav ] ) .",
    "now we can transform from particle positions to trajectories by writing @xmath776 using this and writing @xmath777 in terms of @xmath766 $ ] allows us to express our correlation function as @xmath778\\int \\left [ dv\\right ] \\left ( \\prod_{l=0}^{n-1 } % % @ g(v_l)\\right)\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k , l=0}^{n-1}\\prod_{h=0}^{n-1}s\\left[\\frac{2\\pi % % @ l}{n},w_{kh}\\right]\\delta(x_k(t)-x)~. \\label{btrajrep}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we have also used the fact that the integrand in this representation is explicitly symmetric in the spatial integration variables to change the spatial integration to @xmath779 \\equiv\\int_{0}^{l}dx_{n-1}\\int_{0}^{l}dx_{n-%%@ 2}\\ldots \\int_{0}^{l}dx_{1}$ ] .",
    "in this appendix , we briefly outline our approximate ` mean - field ' theory for the relaxation function @xmath418 .",
    "we begin by noting that the classical model defined in section  [ finitet ] has been solved exactly in ref  @xcite for the special case in which there is only one possible value for the spin label @xmath396 .",
    "all of the difficulties we encounter in attempting to generalize this solution to the case of interest here stem from the fact that there are complicated correlations between the @xmath430 ( defined in section  [ finitet ] ) at different times .",
    "our ` mean - field ' approximation consists of simply ignoring these correlation effects ( hence our choice of terminology to describe our approximation ) . having made this uncontrolled approximation , it is now a fairly straightforward matter to obtain a closed form expression for @xmath418 in analogy with the corresponding discussion in @xcite .",
    "the actual calculation proceeds as follows : let @xmath39 be the probability that any given solid line in fig  [ fig9 ] intersects the dotted line .",
    "if we ignore the correlations between the @xmath430 at different times , then the probability that this line carries a spin label equal to the spin label of the dotted line is @xmath800 .",
    "so given that the line intersects the dotted line , this intersection contributes a factor of @xmath197 to @xmath418 with probability @xmath800 and a factor of @xmath176 with probability @xmath652 ( if the line does not intersect at all , we of course get a factor of @xmath14 ) . within our mean field theory ,",
    "@xmath261 is just a product of such factors , one from each solid line .",
    "this gives @xmath801 , where @xmath42 is the total number of thermally excited particles in the system .",
    "now , using @xmath802  @xcite ( where the angular brackets denote averaging over the maxwell - boltzmann distribution function for @xmath803 and @xmath219 is the length of the system ) and taking the thermodynamic limit , we obtain @xmath804 .",
    "we can now do our usual rescalings and write down the main result of our mean field theory : @xmath805 where the angular brackets now denote averaging over the distribution @xmath806 and @xmath720 and @xmath454 are defined as in section  [ finitet ] . in particular , note that this implies @xmath807 ; this turns out to be reasonably accurate for some purposes ( see the discussion on the approximate form of the scaling function @xmath713 in section  [ finitet ] ) .    by c. broholm in _ dynamical properties of unconventional magnetic systems _ , proceedings of the nato advanced study institute , geilo , norway , april 2 - 12 , 1997 , a.  skjeltorp and d.  sherrington eds . ,",
