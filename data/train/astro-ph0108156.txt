    "ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) radiate most of their extremely large , quasar - like luminosities ( @xmath2 ) as infrared dust emission , and dominate the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function in the nearby universe @xcite .",
    "recent studies have revealed that the bulk of the cosmic sub - mm background emission has been resolved into discrete sources , similar to nearby ulirgs @xcite , and for this reason data on nearby ulirgs have been extensively used to derive information on star - formation rates , dust content , and metallicity in the early universe @xcite . understanding the nature of nearby ulirgs is therefore of particular importance both locally and cosmologically .",
    "in contrast to the majority of less infrared luminous ( @xmath3 10@xmath4 ) galaxies , it has been suggested that energetically important , dust - obscured agns are present in ulirgs ( veilleux , kim , & sanders 1999a ; fischer 2000 ) .",
    "if the geometry of the dust distribution is toroidal and/or the amount of dust along our line of sight is not too great , signatures of such dust - obscured agns can be found in the optical and/or near - infrared wavelength range at @xmath5 2 @xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "however , detecting agns that are deeply embedded in a spherical dust shell ( hereafter buried agns ) and estimating their energetic importance is very difficult at @xmath5 2 @xmath0 m , even though they are energetically important , since spectral tracers are dominated by less strongly obscured star - formation activity .",
    "to detect such buried agns and estimate their energetic importance , we must observe at wavelengths where the effects of dust extinction are smaller .    at wavelengths 313 @xmath0",
    "m , dust extinction is lower .",
    "furthermore , emission is dominated by radiation from dust , the dominant emission mechanism of ulirgs .",
    "thus , discussions of the energy sources of ulirgs are more straightforward than those based on observations at x - ray or radio wavelengths , which are also potentially capable of detecting buried agns , but are dominated by emission mechanisms other than dust emission .",
    "finally , by using spectral features at 313 @xmath0 m , we can distinguish the energy sources of individual galaxies : while star - formation - dominated galaxies show strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission features , buried agns should show dust absorption features below smooth continuum emission @xcite . using spectral features , particularly the 7.7 @xmath0 m pah emission , in the rest - frame 511 @xmath0 m spectra obtained with the _ infrared space observatory _",
    "( iso ) , it has been argued that the majority of ulirgs are star - formation powered @xcite .",
    "however , the determination of the continuum level with respect to which emission and absorption features should be measured in _ iso _",
    "spectra is highly uncertain , due to insufficient wavelength coverage longward of these features .",
    "distinguishing between star - formation and buried agn activity therefore remains controversial @xcite .    as discussed in @xcite , observations at 34 @xmath0 m have two important advantages : firstly , dust extinction is as small as that at 78 @xmath0 m @xcite ; and secondly , the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission and 3.4 @xmath0 m carbonaceous dust absorption features can be used to distinguish between the different energy sources of ulirgs , without serious uncertainty in the continuum determination .",
    "ground - based 34 @xmath0 m spectroscopy is thus potentially a powerful tool to investigate the energetic importance of agns buried in the compact nuclei of ulirgs , and to settle the controversy discussed above .",
    "our particular interest is the search for buried agns in ulirgs with cool far - infrared colors and/or non - seyfert optical spectra , which are typically taken to be star - formation - dominated , based on _ iso _ studies ( genzel & cesarsky 2000 ; taniguchi et al .",
    "1999 ; lutz , veilleux , & genzel 1999 ) .",
    "ugc 5101 is such a ulirg ( table 1 in this paper ; veilleux et al .",
    "1999a ) , and has actually been diagnosed as being star - formation powered @xcite . in this letter",
    ", we report on the results of 34 @xmath0 m spectroscopic observations of ugc 5101 , and the discovery of evidence for an energetically important buried agn in this source . throughout this paper , @xmath6 @xmath7 75 km s@xmath8",
    "mpc@xmath8 , @xmath9 = 0.3 , and @xmath10 = 0.7 are adopted .",
    "we used the nsfcam grism mode @xcite to obtain a 34 @xmath0 m spectrum of ugc 5101 at irtf on mauna kea , hawaii on the night of 2001 april 9 ( ut ) .",
    "sky conditions were photometric throughout the observations , and the seeing was measured to be 0@xmath1170@xmath118 in full - width at half maximum .",
    "the detector was a 256 @xmath12 256 insb array .",
    "the hkl grism and l blocker were used with the 4-pixel slit (= 1@xmath13 ) .",
    "the resulting spectral resolution was @xmath14150 at 3.5 @xmath0 m .",
    "the spectrum of ugc 5101 was obtained toward the flux peak at 34 @xmath0 m .",
    "the position angle of the slit was 0 degree east of north .",
    "a standard telescope nodding technique with a throw of 12@xmath15 was employed along the slit to subtract background emission .",
    "hr 4112 ( f8v , v=4.8 ) was observed with an airmass difference of @xmath3 0.1 to correct for the transmission of the earth s atmosphere , and provide flux calibration .",
    "standard data analysis procedures were employed , using iraf .",
    "initially , bad pixels were replaced with the interpolated signals of the surrounding pixels .",
    "bias was subsequently subtracted from the obtained frames and the frames were divided by a spectroscopic flat frame .",
    "finally the spectra of ugc 5101 and hr 4112 were extracted .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed taking into account the wavelength - dependent transmission of the earth s atmosphere . since we set each exposure time to 1.2 sec for the ugc 5101 observation , to reduce observing overheads , data at @xmath16 4 @xmath0 m",
    "were affected by the non - linear response of the detector .",
    "we excluded these data from our analysis .",
    "the ugc 5101 spectrum was then divided by the observed spectrum of hr 4112 and multiplied by the spectrum of a blackbody with a temperature appropriate to f8v stars ( 6200k ) . by adopting @xmath17 = 3.4 for hr 4112 based on @xmath18 = 1.4 @xcite ,",
    "a flux - calibrated spectrum was produced .",
    "a flux - calibrated 34 @xmath0 m spectrum of ugc 5101 is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] . at 34 @xmath0 m ,",
    "ugc 5101 was spatially very compact , and its spatial extent along the slit direction was indistinguishable from a point source .",
    "the spatially - unresolved red near - infrared nucleus reported by @xcite and interpreted as a possible agn by these authors is the probable origin of the bulk of the detected 34 @xmath0 m continuum in our spectrum .",
    "our spectrum gives a value of @xmath17 ( 3.55 @xmath0 m ) of 10.1 mag , which is similar to the value of @xmath19 ( 3.7 @xmath0 m ) of 9.8 mag measured with a 5@xmath15 aperture @xcite .",
    "given that ugc 5101 has a red near - infrared color ( @xmath20 = 1.3 ; sanders et al .",
    "1988a ) , so that @xmath21 should be @xmath16 0 mag , our slit loss for the continuum emission is less than 0.3 mag . the dust continuum emission at 1020 @xmath0 m @xcite , pa@xmath22 emission ( genzel et al .",
    "1998 , the top - middle of fig 8) , and 618 cm radio continuum emission @xcite all show a centrally peaked morphology , with spatially - extended emission presumably originating in weakly obscured star - formation activity .",
    "our 1@xmath112 slit covers the bulk of this emission , so that most of the pah emission should also be covered with our slit .",
    "any missing pah flux is very likely to be much smaller than the detected pah flux , and will not seriously affect our quantitative discussion of the energy source of ugc 5101 ( @xmath23 4.1 ) .    the spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows a remarkable deviation at 3.33.7 @xmath0 m from the smooth continuum emission .",
    "( a linear continuum level is shown as the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . )",
    "we attribute the emission feature to 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission , since the flux peak at 3.42 @xmath0 m is consistent with the expected peak wavelength of the redshifted pah emission ( 3.29 @xmath0 m @xmath12 1.040 ) . based on our adopted linear continuum level ,",
    "the observed flux and rest - frame equivalent width of the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission are estimated to be f@xmath24 = 1.3 @xmath12 10@xmath25 ergs s@xmath8 @xmath26 and ew@xmath24 = 0.025 @xmath0 m , respectively .    at wavelengths longward of the pah emission ,",
    "signals at 3.53.7 @xmath0 m are suppressed compared to the continuum level .",
    "the flux level suddenly and steeply decreases at @xmath143.7 @xmath0 m , compared to the extrapolation from longer wavelengths , so that a strong absorption feature is undoubtedly present .",
    "we attribute this flux suppression to the 3.4 @xmath0 m carbonaceous dust absorption @xcite , because the observed maximum of absorption at @xmath143.53 @xmath0 m is consistent with the redshifted absorption peak wavelength of the carbonaceous dust absorption feature ( 3.4 @xmath0 m @xmath12 1.040 ) .",
    "its observed optical depth is @xmath27(observed ) @xmath14 0.7 .",
    "the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission profile almost fades out at 3.333.34 @xmath0 m @xcite , while the 3.4 @xmath0 m carbonaceous dust absorption profile is just beginning at this wavelength range @xcite . at _ z _ = 0.040 , this wavelength range , where neither emission nor absorption is particularly important , is redshifted to 3.463.47 @xmath0 m .",
    "it will be seen that in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the adopted linear continuum intersects the observed data points at this wavelength , providing further evidence that the continuum determination is reasonable . an alternative hypothesis is represented by the curved continuum shown as the dashed line in fig .",
    "if this model were adopted , the observed flux and rest frame equivalent width of the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission would increase to f@xmath24 = 2.0 @xmath12 10@xmath25 ergs s@xmath8 @xmath26 and ew@xmath24 = 0.045 @xmath0 m , respectively , and the observed optical depth of the 3.4 @xmath0 m dust absorption would decrease to @xmath27(observed ) @xmath14 0.6 .",
    "however , the level of this curved continuum seems to be too low ; it requires that the absorption optical depth be close to zero at 3.48 @xmath0 m or 3.35 @xmath0 m in the rest frame , where the optical depth should in fact be significant @xcite .",
    "we thus believe that the actual pah flux and equivalent width are lower than the values inferred using the curved continuum level ; we can use these latter values as stringent upper limits . considering the uncertainty of the continuum determination , we combine the values measured based on the two continuum levels and adopt f@xmath24 = 1.6@xmath280.3 @xmath12 10@xmath25 ergs s@xmath8 @xmath26 ,",
    "ew@xmath24 = 0.035@xmath280.010 @xmath0 m , and @xmath27(observed ) = 0.65@xmath280.05 .",
    "the detection of 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission indicates the presence of star - formation activity .",
    "however , its observed luminosity is 5.2@xmath281.0 @xmath12 10@xmath29 ergs s@xmath8 , which yields an observed 3.3 @xmath0 m pah to far - infrared luminosity ratio ( table 1 ) of @xmath141 @xmath12 10@xmath30 , an order of magnitude smaller than is found in star - formation - dominated galaxies ( @xmath141 @xmath12 10@xmath31 ; mouri et al . 1990 ) .",
    "the detected , weakly - obscured star - formation activity thus contributes little to the huge far - infrared luminosity of ugc 5101 and a dominant energy source must be located behind the dust .",
    "the presence of such a dust - obscured energy source is supported by the detection of strong 3.4 @xmath0 m carbonaceous dust absorption .",
    "if the 34 @xmath0 m continuum emission source behind the dust originated in star - formation activity , the rest - frame equivalent width of the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission should be similar to those of less obscured star - formation - dominated galaxies ( @xmath140.12 @xmath0 m ; imanishi & dudley 2000 ) , because both 34 @xmath0 m continuum and 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission fluxes would be attenuated similarly by dust extinction .",
    "the observed rest - frame equivalent width is , however , smaller by more than a factor of three .",
    "consequently , the emission from behind the dust shows virtually no pah emission , suggesting that the source is an agn .",
    "this agn activity dominates the observed 34 @xmath0 m continuum flux , contributing @xmath1470 % of it , and is plausibly the energy source of ugc 5101 s far - infrared luminosity .",
    "if the dust obscuring such an energetically important agn had a torus - like geometry , we would expect ugc 5101 to be optically classified as a seyfert 2 , but in fact the non - seyfert optical classification of ugc 5101 @xcite implies that the agn is obscured by dust along all lines of sight ( that is , a buried agn ) .",
    "after subtracting the contribution from star - formation to the observed 34 @xmath0 m fluxes by using the spectral shape of the starburst galaxy ngc 253 in @xcite , we estimate the intrinsic optical depth of the 3.4 @xmath0 m carbonaceous dust absorption toward the buried agn to be @xmath27(intrinsic ) @xmath14 0.8 , which yields dust extinction of @xmath32 @xmath16 100 mag if a galactic extinction curve is assumed @xcite . assuming a@xmath33 @xmath14 0.05 @xmath12 a@xmath34 @xcite",
    ", we estimate the dereddened 34 @xmath0 m dust emission luminosity powered by the buried agn to be @xmath35l@xmath36 @xmath3710@xmath38 ergs s@xmath8 , which is comparable to the _ observed _ peak dust emission luminosity at 60 @xmath0 m and 100 @xmath0 m ( @xmath35l@xmath36 @xmath14 2 @xmath12 10@xmath38 ergs s@xmath8 , as calculated based on the _ iras _ fluxes shown in table 1 ) . in the case of a buried agn , dust radiative transfer controls the temperature of the dust shell ; the temperature of the dust decreases with increasing distance from the central agn .",
    "the entire luminosity is transferred at each temperature .",
    "the present data thus provide evidence for an inner @xmath14900 k , 34 @xmath0 m continuum emitting dust shell of a luminosity similar to that of the observed outer @xmath1440 k , 60100 @xmath0 m continuum emitting dust shell , as is expected from the buried agn scenario .    for obscured agns",
    ", @xcite found that the column density of x - ray absorbing gas , parameterized by @xmath39 , relative to dust extinction towards the 34 @xmath0 m continuum emitting region ( @xmath32 ) is often higher by a large factor than the galactic @xmath39/@xmath32 ratio ( 1.8 @xmath12 10@xmath40 cm@xmath8 mag@xmath8 ; predehl & schmitt 1995 ) .",
    "dust obscuration toward the 34 @xmath0 m continuum emitting region around the buried agn in ugc 5101 is so high ( @xmath42 100 mag : this work ) that @xmath39 could easily exceed 10@xmath43 @xmath26 , in which case direct 210 kev x - ray emission from the buried agns would be very strongly attenuated .",
    "the non - detection of 210 kev x - rays from the putative buried agn with asca @xcite can thus be explained without difficulty .",
    "the radio to far - infrared flux ratio of ugc 5101 is a factor of two larger than the typical values for star - formation - dominated galaxies at 1.5 ghz @xcite , but inside their scatter at 151 mhz and 5 ghz @xcite .",
    "though the bulk of the radio emission is extended @xcite , the spatially - unresolved vlbi radio core , interpreted as an agn by @xcite , is luminous enough to account for the bolomotric luminosity of ugc 5101 with agn activity @xcite .      besides ugc 5101 ,",
    "studies in the thermal infrared have provided evidence for the presence of energetically dominant buried agns in two other optically non - seyfert ulirgs , iras 08572 + 3915 @xcite and iras f00183@xmath17111 @xcite .",
    "the far - infrared emission properties of these three ulirgs are summarized in table 1 . in the optical ,",
    "all are classified as liners @xcite . for ulirgs classified optically as liners , which constitute @xmath1440% of ulirgs @xcite , two arguments based on _ iso _ studies",
    "have been made : ( 1 ) star - formation activity is energetically dominant , and ( 2 ) the liner - type optical line emission is due to superwind - driven shocks caused by star - formation activity @xcite . the first argument , however , is not applicable to the three ulirgs in table 1 .",
    "then what is the origin of the liner - type optical emission in these objects ?    in buried agns , uv emission is blocked at the inner surface of the surrounding dust shell , but x - rays can penetrate deeply into the dust to produce x - ray dissociation regions ( xdrs ; maloney , holllenbach , & tielens 1996 ) . in xdrs ,",
    "locally - generated uv photons , such as lyman - werner band h@xmath44 emission and ly@xmath22 emission , can ionize some species with ionization potential less than 1011 ev ( notably carbon and iron ) , but the emitting volume is dominated by largely neutral gas , which causes xdrs essentially always to have liner - type spectra ( maloney , in preparation ) .",
    "a buried agn can thus explain the observed liner - type optical emission",
    ".    however , in practical cases , some star - formation activity may very well be present at the surface of galaxies even when buried agns are energetically dominant , as we infer for ugc 5101 .",
    "in such a case , due to the susceptibility of optical emission to dust extinction , the optical spectral diagnostics are likely to be dominated by this surface star - formation emission",
    ". the star - formation activity could be responsible for liner - type optical emission via shocks , or might even alter the optical emission to a hii region type .",
    "it is important to note that narrow - line emission from high - excitation clouds characteristic of seyfert galaxy spectra which are observed to be produced along the axes of nuclear dust tori would not contribute substantially at any wavelength in the case of buried agn .",
    "we have found evidence for the presence of an energetically dominant , buried agn in the ulirg ugc 5101 , which is characterized by a cool far - infrared color and a liner optical spectrum .",
    "this finding seems contrary to the currently established view , based on _ iso _ data , that such objects are powered by star formation .",
    "two other liner ulirgs also show evidence for energetically dominant buried agns , and we therefore conclude that at least some fraction of liner ulirgs are powered by buried agns .",
