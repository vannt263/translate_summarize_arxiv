    "magnetars are slowly rotating neutron stars that , in contrast to ordinary pulsars , are not powered by their spin - down energy losses , but by the energy stored in their extremely large magnetic fields , typically @xmath3 10@xmath4 g @xcite .",
    "they are divided into two groups , soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) , whose relation to each other and to other kinds of neutron stars is still a matter of debate @xcite .",
    "sgrs were discovered as sources emitting short repeating bursts in the hard x - ray / soft @xmath5-ray band , while axps were first detected in the soft x - ray band .",
    "recently , sources have been found that show properties of both groups , suggesting that axps and sgrs belong to the same family ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "many attempts have been made to find pulsed radio emission from magnetars ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) but it was not until 2006 that the first detection was reported @xcite .",
    "to date only two axps have confirmed radio pulsations , namely xtej1810197 @xcite and 1e15475408 @xcite .",
    "both of these sources are transient axps , a subgroup of magnetars that occasionally undergo very bright x - ray outbursts .",
    "their pulsed radio emission was discovered in connection with these outbursts , and is observed to fade with time after an outburst .    here",
    "we report on the discovery of psr j16224950 , the first magnetar discovered in the radio band , and discuss its properties in relation to the two magnetars previously known to emit radio pulsations .",
    "the high time resolution universe ( htru ) survey for pulsars and fast transients is currently being carried out at the parkes 64-m radio telescope @xcite , using the 20-cm multibeam receiver @xcite . in brief , an effective bandwidth of 341mhz , centered around 1.35ghz , is divided into 874 frequency channels and sampled using 2 bits every 64@xmath6s . in april 2009 ( mjd = 54939 ) a bright radio pulsar , psrj16224950 , was discovered .",
    "it has a period ( @xmath7 ) of 4.326s and a dispersion measure ( dm ) of 820@xmath8pc , corresponding to a distance of @xmath0 9kpc , if the cordes  lazio model for the distribution of the electrons in the interstellar medium is assumed @xcite .        after the htru discovery we embarked on a timing campaign , observing psrj16224950 a total of 110 times at 1.4ghz and 10 times at 3.1ghz , obtaining polarimetric information on most occasions .",
    "the digital filterbank system ( dfb3 ) used to create the folded profiles first converts the analogue voltages from each polarization channel of the linear feeds into digital signals .",
    "it then produces 1024 polyphase filterbank frequency channels that are folded at the apparent topocentric period of the pulsar into 1024 pulsar phase bins , and written to disk every 20s .",
    "four stokes parameters are recorded . to determine the relative gain of the two polarization channels and the phase between them ,",
    "a calibration signal is injected at an angle of 45@xmath9 to the feed probes .",
    "the data are analyzed off - line using the psrchive package @xcite and corrected for parallactic angle and the orientation of the feed .",
    "the position angles are also corrected for faraday rotation through the interstellar medium using the nominal rotation measure .",
    "the area of sky containing psrj16224950 was covered previously by the parkes multibeam pulsar survey @xcite but , somewhat surprisingly given its large apparent flux density and dm , the pulsar was not detected in these data . however , that survey did find two other radio pulsars in close proximity to psrj16224950 and monitored them for a number of years , namely psrs j16234949 and j16224944 at an angular separation of 11@xmath10 and 7@xmath10 respectively .",
    "these archival data were reprocessed using the period and dm of psrj16224950 .",
    "the first detection was made in observations recorded in june 1999 ( mjd = 51334 ) , and it was then detected in 11 observations between october 2000 ( mjd = 51844 ) and july 2002 ( mjd = 52458 ) ( see the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : lightcurve ] ) .",
    "however , in the 14 subsequent observations preceding august 2006 ( mjd = 53975 ) , the pulsar was detected only once .",
    "no further archival data of the two nearby pulsars were available after that date .",
    "the methanol multibeam pulsar survey at 6.3ghz @xcite also covered the part of the sky containing psrj16224950 , and by reprocessing the relevant data , the pulsar was detected in an observation taken in april 2007 ( mjd = 54211 ) .",
    "observations of the pulsar were made on 8 dec 2009 and 27 feb 2010 with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) , an east - west synthesis telescope located near narrabri , nsw , which consists of six 22-m antennas on a 6-km track .",
    "the observations were carried out simultaneously at 5.5 and 9.0 ghz with a bandwidth of 2 ghz at each frequency subdivided into 2048 spectral channels , and full stokes parameters .",
    "the source was tracked for 12-hours in each of the ew352 and 750b array configurations .",
    "initial data reduction and analysis were carried out with the miriad package using standard techniques . after flagging bad data ,",
    "the primary calibrator ( pks 1934 - 638 ) was used for flux density and bandpass calibration and the secondary calibrator ( pks j1613 - 586 ) was used to solve for antenna gains , phases and polarization leakage terms .",
    "we also obtained a 20-ks _ chandra _ observation performed with acis - i on 10 july 2009 to search for an x - ray counterpart .",
    "figure [ fig : atca - cxo ] shows the resultant radio and x - ray images .",
    "although there are a number of radio and x - ray sources present in the field of view , a highly polarized radio point source is coincident with the brightest x - ray source , cxou j162244.8495054 , which is also the counterpart of a source seen in archival asca data , ax j1622464946 .",
    "we note that cxou j162244.8495054 was one of only two x - ray sources in the field without an optical / infrared counterpart .",

    "throughout the htru timing campaign , the pulsar was detected in every observation with a greatly varying flux density , which fluctuated by as much as a factor of @xmath06 within a 24hour period .",
    "these flux variations can not be attributed to interstellar scintillation and must be intrinsic to the source , as at 20 cm wavelengths , pulsar flux densities are reasonably stable at such large dms @xcite .",
    "the pulse profile averaged over each observation ( typically 5 - 10 minutes ) also changes shape on short timescales , often from day to day .",
    "although such variability in both the integrated profile and the flux density is very uncommon in pulsars , it is a distinctive feature of the two magnetars whose pulsed emission has been detected in the radio band ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . the light curve for psrj16224950 and three representative pulse profiles",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lightcurve ] .      to attain a stable timing solution of a source that is changing its pulse profile from observation to observation , special care needs to be taken in the timing procedure . in conventional pulsar timing a standard profile is created and used to calculate each pulse s time of arrival ( toa ) at the telescope . in the case of psrj16224950",
    "each pulse profile is different , but we noticed that all profiles seem to consist of the same components , only differing by their amplitudes ( and sometimes the amplitude for a specific component was indistinguishable from zero ) .",
    "software from the psrchive package @xcite was used to fit gaussians to one of the profiles that showed all the different components and a model was made to describe how the components build up the profile .",
    "this model was then used to calculate toas , by letting the amplitudes of the different components vary .",
    "when toas for all our observations were calculated , the tempo software was used to analyze the rotational history of psrj16224950 .",
    "the resultant fit requires at least 9 period derivatives to obtain reasonable phase connection for all our data , which is not uncommon for magnetars @xcite . to monitor variations of the period derivative with time ,",
    "we have also measured @xmath11 and @xmath12 over several time intervals separately .",
    "the time spans were chosen to be as long as possible while keeping phase connection without adding higher period derivatives .",
    "this usually resulted in groups of toas spanning about 40 days each .",

    "since the distance calculated from the dm has a large uncertainty and is known only to within a factor of two or so , the derived x - ray luminosity may be in error by up to a factor of four . even within these errors ,",
    "the ratio is significantly higher than for ordinary pulsars , but well within the range for the magnetars 1e15475408 and xtej1810197 which have @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) in quiescence and larger ratios in outburst .",
    "the radio emission from xtej1810197 was discovered immediately following a strong x - ray outburst .",
    "it has since faded , both in the radio and the x - ray band , and the radio pulsations are no longer visible . for 1e15475408 ,",
    "the radio emission is also highly variable and appears to be ` revived ' in the periods after its x - ray outbursts .",
    "psr j16224950 on the other hand , has had at least two episodes of non - detections in the radio band lasting hundreds of days followed by periods of bright radio emission ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lightcurve ] ) .",
    "in addition to the new _ chandra _ observation , we searched archival data from _ chandra _ , _ xmm newton _",
    ", _ rosat _ , _ asca _ , _ beppo - sax _ , _ rossi - xte _ and _ swift _ for an outburst , however no evidence for x - ray flux variability and no x - ray outburst at the level of the outbursts seen in xte1810197 and 1e15475408 in connection to the radio pulsations ( @xmath3 10@xmath65ergs@xmath15 ) were found since at least as early as 2005 .",
    "it is possible therefore that an enhancement of x - ray activity is not a requirement for pulsed radio emission by magnetars , however , given the duty cycle of sensitive x - ray observations of the field containing psrj16224950 , we can not constrain the occurrence of fainter x - ray enhancements of the source .",
    "what is instead certain is that the observed x - ray emission from psrj16224950 is at variance with what is observed for the other two radio pulsating magnetars .",
    "if the true age of psrj16224950 is similar to its characteristic age of 4kyr , we might expect to see a supernova remnant ( snr ) surrounding the pulsar .",
    "indeed , 5 of the 9 axps and at least 1 of the 5 sgrs are located within snrs ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "inspecting the atca image in fig .",
    "[ fig : atca - cxo ] , we see a ring of emission centered @xmath02@xmath10 south of the pulsar location .",
    "this ring lacks an infra - red counterpart and appears to be non thermal , whereas the extended radio source to the south of the ring is clearly thermal in nature .",
    "could the ring be the snr and the pulsar has escaped its bounds ?",
    "if we assume a distance of @xmath09kpc to the magnetar and further assume it was born in the centre of the ring , the magnetar would need a velocity of @xmath01300kms@xmath15 to reach its current location whereas the ring itself would have a lower expansion velocity .",
    "such a velocity is high ( though not impossible ) for pulsars but rather low for expanding snrs .",
    "although the link between the ring and the magnetar is a possibility we consider it unlikely .",
    "the htru survey has discovered a radio - luminous pulsar , which is highly polarized , has an inverted spectrum , and is highly variable in both its pulse profile and flux density .",
    "the radio pulsar has a faint x - ray counterpart that appears to be stable in flux , with a value that is typical of a quiescent magnetar .",
    "the pulsar shares many of the properties of the two known radio magnetars and we therefore conclude that psrj16224950 is indeed a magnetar , the first discovered through its radio emission .",
    "this discovery not only adds a new member to the magnetar family , but also highlights unprecedented features of the emission of the magnetars across the electromagnetic band . at odds with what is observed in other sources",
    ", psrj16224950 indicates that bright radio emission can be present even when a magnetar displays an x - ray luminosity typical of a quiescent state . moreover , psrj16224950 shows that _ pulsed _ radio emission can either exist without the occurrence of a strong x - ray outburst , or occur a long time ( @xmath3 5 years ) after the outburst .",
    "alternatively , the radio pulsations could be triggered by a modest increment of x - ray activity , that escaped detection in this case .",
    "we finally note that the extreme variability in the flux density of psrj16224950 also demonstrates the advantages of surveying the radio sky at regular intervals with even modest sensitivity .",
    "this highlights the potential of the upcoming radio facilities like the lofar , askap or the ska which promise to characterize the dynamic radio sky at an unprecedented level .",
