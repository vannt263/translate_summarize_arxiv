    "most analytical expressions of an exoplanetary primary transit lightcurve are derived from analytical expressions of the optical depth along an unrefracted ray , i.e. that travels in a straight light , through a homogeneous isothermal atmospheres ( see e. g. fortney 2005 ; lecavelier des etangs et al .",

    "refraction is also important in various observational geometries in our solar system .",
    "it influences the perceived brightness of a star during a stellar occultation by a planetary atmosphere ( see the review by smith & hunten  1990 ) which can then be used to infer the planet s atmospheric composition .",
    "it also determines the brightness of moons eclipsed by their parent planet .",
    "indeed , as a moon moves deeper in the penumbra , solar radiation must traverse deeper atmospheric regions of the eclipsing planet in order to be bent sufficiently to reach the moon .",
    "several lunar eclipse observations were analysed to derive the transmission of earth s atmosphere ( pall et al .",

    "2014 ) using this principle .    given the importance of atmospheric refraction in these various observational geometries , it is worthwhile to have analytical formulae which include refraction , both to compute the ray s deflection , as well as the integrated number density along the deflected ray , or its column abundance . combined with an atmosphere - averaged extinction cross section , one can compute the optical depth along the ray , and the corresponding atmospheric transmission with beer s law .",
    "however , computing the column abundance and the deflection requires solving complicated integrals for which analytical expressions exist only under simplifying assumptions . in section  [ analytical ] ,",
    "we derive analytical solutions of these integrals by expanding the integrand in a taylor - series up to the second order with respect to refractivity , and then evaluate the integral for each of these terms .",
    "this is done for a homogeneous isothermal atmosphere , since this is the level of complexity considered by some exoplanet atmosphere retrieval algorithm ( see e.g. charbonneau et al .",

    "we also derive an order - of - magnitude estimate of the sum of the remaining uncomputed higher - order terms in the taylor series , in order to determine the density region over which our analytical expressions are useful .",
    "since planetary atmospheres are usually not isothermal , we have to rely on numerical methods to deal with these general cases for which analytical solutions do not exist . in section",
    "[ numerical ] , we describe makexoshell , a new numerical ray tracing algorithm that computes the column abundance and the deflection for rays traversing a spherically symmetric atmosphere given an arbitrary one - dimensional ( 1-d ) temperature - pressure profile as input . we also describe how we compute the model atmosphere , as well as its refractivity , which are inputs to makexoshell . in section  [ validation ] , we compare the output of the numerical algorithm with our analytical expressions for an earth - like planet with a homogeneous isothermal atmosphere , in order to mutually validate both methods .",
    "we also discuss the impact of our new model on temperate earth - like and jovian - like exoplanets , as well as for two already well - observed exoplanets : hd189733b and gj1214b .",
    "we summarise our results in section  [ conclusion ] .    , and of the top of the atmosphere , @xmath0 , as well as the zenith angle , @xmath1 , of the ray for a given height , r , are also indicated .",
    "a light ray observed with an impact parameter  @xmath2 , entered the atmosphere with an incidence angle @xmath3 a projected distance @xmath4 to the centre of the planet with respect to the observer , reached a grazing height @xmath5 , and is deflected by @xmath6 by the atmosphere .",
    "as light rays traverse a planetary atmosphere , they are bent by refraction toward the surface of the planet ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) due to the exponential increase of atmospheric refractivity ( the refraction index minus one ) , with decreasing altitude .",
    "the trajectory of a ray is described by an invariant , @xmath2 , which is equal to its impact parameter ( phinney & anderson 1968 ; btrmieux & kaltenegger 2013 , 2014 ) @xmath7 here , @xmath8 is the radial position with respect to the centre of the planet ( i.e. radius + altitude ) , which for the sake of brevity we will refer to as height throughout the paper , while @xmath9 and @xmath1 are the refractivity of the atmosphere and the zenith angle of the ray at that height , respectively .",
    "@xmath5 is the minimum height reached by a ray , or its grazing height , where the atmospheric refractivity is @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath0 is the radial position of the top of the atmosphere and @xmath11 is the zenith angle of the ray at the top of the atmosphere , or simply its incidence angle .",
    "the atmosphere deflected the ray by @xmath6 , and the ray entered the atmosphere a projected distance @xmath4 to the centre of the planet , with respect to the observer , given by @xmath12    the change in zenith angle of the ray with height is given by , @xmath13 the first term is the refractive term and comes from snell s law .",
    "the second term is the geometric term , and comes from the equation of an unrefracted ray , @xmath14 , which proceeds in a straight line .",
    "note that all of the equations involving angles are valid when these are expressed in radians , even though in section  [ validation ] we quote results in degrees .",
    "the atmospheric refractivity is given by , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the number density , @xmath17 is the number density at standard temperature and pressure ( stp ) also known as loschmidt s number , @xmath18 is the mole fraction of the j@xmath19 chemical species , @xmath20 is the stp refractivity of the j@xmath19 species , while @xmath21 is the stp refractivity of the atmosphere .",
    "the ratio inside the parenthesis in equation  [ refrac ] is the number density expressed in units of amagat .",
    "note that the stp refractivity is simply the refractivity for a density of 1  amagat , which can be achieved for temperatures other than 273.15  k with the appropriate pressure .    the number density , @xmath16 , in an atmospheric region varies with height , and this dependence can be expressed by @xmath22 so that @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the density scale height in that atmospheric region , and the @xmath25 and @xmath26 subscripts denote quantities for the upper and lower boundaries of the region , respectively .",
    "thus , @xmath27 note that this result holds only for a homogeneous atmospheric region where the composition of the major constituents that contribute significantly to the refraction index does not change with height , i.e. that @xmath21 is constant with height .",
    "this assumption will be carried throughout all derivations .      in order for a ray to traverse the atmosphere",
    ", @xmath1 must increase as @xmath8 decreases ( or @xmath28/@xmath29 ) so that a downward - going ray reaches a minimum height , @xmath5 , where it grazes the atmosphere ( @xmath30 ) . if @xmath28/@xmath31 , the ray will spiral deeper into the atmosphere until it is absorbed . using equations  [ gradzenith",
    "] , we can derive that @xmath32 is the necessary condition for a ray to traverse the atmosphere .",
    "using equation  [ gradindex ] , this can be rewritten as , @xmath33 in the special case when this expression is equal to one , a ray which is tangential to the atmosphere will circle the planet as its radius of curvature matches its height . knowing the height - dependence of the density , and thus refractivity , this equation can be solved recursively for this special height .",
    "as a ray approaches this height , both the column abundance and the deflection tend toward infinity .",
    "atmospheric regions below this height can not be probed by transmitted stellar radiation under any circumstance during a stellar occultation or an exoplanet primary transit .",
    "this is true only for a perfectly spherical planet free of horizontal density gradients ( i.e. no weather or turbulence ) .",
    "departure from these assumptions creates a diffuse boundary about which a grazing ray can or can not escape the planet depending on local conditions .",
    "furthermore , since refractivities vary with wavelength , so does the height of this lower boundary .",
    "this lower boundary is always located below the critical altitude , described in @xcite , below which atmospheric regions can not be probed by transmission spectroscopy when an exoplanet occults the central area of its host star .",
    "this critical altitude occurs where a ray , that comes from the opposite limb of the star , reaches an atmospheric critical density which causes it to be deflected by a critical deflection , @xmath34 , toward the observer . during the course of the transit ,",
    "the symmetry is broken and part of the planetary limb can be probed to lower altitudes while the opposite limb s observable region is restricted to higher altitudes .",
    "however , the lowest altitude that one can probe only asymptotically approaches the lower boundary determined by equation  [ condition ] , so that this boundary is the deepest atmospheric region that can ever be probed by exoplanet transmission spectroscopy or by stellar occultation .      the column abundance , @xmath35 , along a refracted ray , as well as its deflection , @xmath6 , can be computed from @xmath36 and @xmath37 where the factor of 2 comes from a ray traversing an altitude region twice .",
    "note that we have labelled the integrands in terms of the integration parameter @xmath8 in both equations for future use ( see section  [ taylorexp ] ) .",
    "the incremental column abundance , @xmath38 , of a ray is given by , @xmath39 the incremental deflection of a ray ( expressed in radians ) , @xmath40 , is simply the first term in equation  [ gradzenith ] ( see also goldsmith 1963 ; auer & standish 2000 ) , which we rewrite as @xmath41 for a homogeneous planetary atmosphere .",
    "the trigonometric functions can be rewritten entirely in terms of @xmath8 and @xmath9 . from equation  [ raypath ] , we have @xmath42 @xmath43 and @xmath44    equations  [ colab ] and [ defl ] are then given , for a homogeneous atmosphere , by @xmath45 and @xmath46 where most of the height - dependence is buried inside the refractivity .",
    "no analytical solutions exist for the complicated integrals in equations  [ colabexpr ] and [ deflexpr ] , even in the case of a homogeneous isothermal atmosphere .",
    "however , refractivities are typically small , on the order of @xmath47 at stp , such that one can expand the integrand in both equations in taylor series in @xmath10 , prior to carrying - out the integration .",
    "we carry out this taylor expansion for both integrands @xmath48 and @xmath49 to the second order such that @xmath50 and @xmath51    for a homogeneous isothermal atmosphere , we have the additional relations , @xmath52 and @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath10 are the number density and the refractivity at a ray s grazing height , respectively .",

    ", we get a term that drops out when evaluated at 1 and @xmath69 and an integral term that can either be expressed as a modified bessel function or must be further integrated by parts . again , the derivation is straightforward but rather lengthy so we only here quote the results : @xmath72\\ ] ] @xmath73 \\\\",

    "even though we have only explicitly collected terms up to @xmath84 for the column abundance , and @xmath85 for the deflection , we can determine by inspection that higher - order terms follow this trend .",
    "these coefficients are themselves power - series expansion in term of @xmath86 , but each of them quickly converges since this ratio is always small .",
    "both series depends on @xmath87 , the ratio of gas column abundance along a grazing ray to that along a vertical ray ( given by @xmath88 ) for a curved exponential atmosphere .",
    "this ratio , which we will call the slant factor , has been described before ( see e.g. fortney 2005 ) .",
    "the leading non - zero term in both series matches previous expressions of the column abundance without refraction ( see references listed in section  [ intro ] ) , as well as first - order expressions for the ray deflection ( goldsmith 1963 ) , respectively .",
    "higher - order terms in the series are surprisingly dependent on powers of @xmath89 , and not simply @xmath10 .",
    "whereas @xmath10 is usually very small , it increases exponentially with depths so that combined with @xmath79 , which is large , @xmath89 can become of order unity .",
    "hence , higher - order terms in the series are far from negligible when a ray travels deep enough in a planetary atmosphere .",
    "so over what range of densities can we use our analytical expressions ?",
    "we have only computed the coefficients up to the second order in refractivity as the length of the calculations , and correspondingly the odd of making a mathematical mistake , increases steeply with order .",
    "however , we can make an order - of - magnitude estimate of the sum of the terms for which we have not explicitly computed the @xmath82 and @xmath83 coefficients , for both the column abundance , @xmath90 , and the deflection , @xmath91 .",
    "this is done by assuming that the unknown coefficients are all identical to the highest - order computed coefficient . under this crude assumption , we can write @xmath92 and @xmath93 where the leading term for @xmath94 and @xmath95 are 0.27 and 0.41 , respectively . the infinite sum , which appears in both equations  [ gencolabun ] and [ gendeflect ] , is a geometric series and converges to @xmath96 but only when @xmath97 it is interesting to note that the condition for the convergence of this series is very close to the condition for a ray to traverse the atmosphere , shown in equation  [ condition ] . indeed",
    ", they only differ by a factor @xmath98 when evaluated at @xmath5 . since @xmath99 , equation  [ condition ] is automatically satisfied when equation  [ crudecond ] is satisfied .",
    "the fact that they are not exactly the same is probably due to our crude method of estimating the remaining terms .",
    "we have made substantial improvements to an algorithm that , given a 1-d model atmospheric temperature - pressure altitude profile , traces rays through that atmosphere and computes the number density column abundance along the rays as well as their deflection by the atmosphere .",
    "this algorithm , which has been previously described by btrmieux & kaltenegger ( 2013 , 2014 ) and references therein , suffered from numerical instabilities in the computed ray deflection , which started at densities of about @xmath100  amagat , and became worse with lower densities , such that the algorithm was useless for densities below @xmath101  amagat .",
    "these numerical instabilities were not only due to improper treatment of integer to double precision conversion of variables , but also intrinsically due to the method .",
    "indeed , we were computing the ray deflection by first computing the azimuthal travel of the ray through the atmosphere , @xmath102 ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) , and then using @xmath103 thus subtracting two large numbers from each other to get a much smaller quantity .",
    "we have modified the algorithm and reduced these numerical instabilities considerably . in this section",
    ", we will describe the new algorithm which we name makexoshell .",
    "the inputs to makexoshell include a 1-d model atmosphere s temperature and pressure , or @xmath104 and @xmath105 , as a function of altitude , @xmath106 . also required",
    "are the radius of the planet , @xmath107 , the highest and lowest altitudes of the computational region , the number of rays and layers sampling this altitude region , and the stp refractivity of the atmosphere . given temperatures and pressures from the model atmosphere , typically in increments of 1  km altitude , makexoshell uses the ideal gas law to determine the corresponding densities .",
    "this serves as a basis for the rest of the computation done on a much finer altitude grid , or computational grid .",
    "makexoshell assumes that the atmosphere within a model atmosphere layer follows an exponential behaviour with a constant density scale height as displayed in equation  [ expoatmos ] .",
    "once the scale height within that layer is computed , using the densities at its upper and lower boundaries , densities are interpolated on the computational grid within that layer .",
    "thus , makexoshell builds - up a density profile on the computational grid from the model atmosphere densities .",
    "this is then combined with the input @xmath21 , as per equation  [ refrac ] , to compute the altitude - dependent refractivity of the atmosphere in the middle of each computational layer .",
    "rays are spread uniformly in altitude , in terms of their grazing height , across the specified computational region . at each of these grazing heights , the density , @xmath54 , and refractivity , @xmath10",
    "are determined from which the impact parameter of each ray can be computed according to equation  [ raypath ] . with the impact parameter of a ray , @xmath2 , as well as the density and the refractivity of the atmosphere on the computational grid , it is possible to compute the column abundance of gas intercepted by a ray , as well as the ray s deflection through the atmosphere .",
    "the computational grid is made up of layers that are thin enough that their densities , and hence their refractivities , are assumed constant across each layer .",
    "thus , density and refractivity changes occur at their boundaries .",
    "in such a case , rays follow a straight line within each computational layer , as shown in fig .",
    "we can see from this simple geometry that @xmath108 and @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 are the azimuthal travel of the ray and the path length of the ray within the computational layer , respectively .",
    "subscript @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote quantities evaluated at the upper and lower boundary of the computational layer , respectively .",
    "quantities without a subscript are evaluated in the middle of the computational layer , except for the impact parameter and the scale height .",
    "the former is ray - dependent , while the latter is determined by the model atmosphere layer to which the computational layer belongs .",
    "both @xmath111 , given by @xmath112 derived from equation  [ geom ] , and @xmath110 depend on the zenith angles of the upper , @xmath113 , and lower boundaries , @xmath114 , of the computational layer .",
    "these are computed with @xmath115 and @xmath116 which have been derived from equation  [ raypath ] .    ]",
    "the column abundance intercepted by a ray in a computational layer is derived simply by @xmath117 while its deflection is given by @xmath118 equation  [ incromega ] is derived from equation  [ incdef ] , recognising that @xmath119 which is the geometric term in equation  [ gradzenith ] .",
    "makexoshell integrates @xmath111 and @xmath110 across all computational layers traversed by each rays , in order to get the column abundance and the deflection across an upward or downward pass for each rays .",
    "the total column abundance and deflection experienced by a ray is twice that quantity since the rays goes through these layers twice : once moving downward , and once moving upward through the atmosphere .",
    "although the computational grid used in btrmieux & kaltenegger ( 2013 , 2014 ) was composed of 0.1  km - thick layers , we have found that the precision of the computations improves significantly when the thickness of the computational layers decreases ( see section  [ comparison ] ) , and that the desired thickness depends on the atmospheric scale height .",
    "hence , we now adjust this parameter as required by the atmosphere for which we do the computations .",
    "the contributions to the column abundance , @xmath120 , and ray deflection , @xmath121 , from atmospheric layers above the top of our computational altitude region are computed by assuming that these upper atmospheric regions are compressed into a shell one scale height thick . at these low densities ,",
    "the ray trajectory is essentially straight , so that the path length of the ray , @xmath122 , inside this shell , is given by @xmath123 where the subscript @xmath124 refers to quantities evaluated at the top of our computational region , or top of the atmosphere , with a corresponding refractivity , @xmath125 , and zenith angle , @xmath126 ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "then , the contribution from these upper layers to the column abundance is simply given by @xmath127 and to the deflection of the ray by @xmath128 the latter equation was derived by using the small angle approximation in equation  [ pathlength ] to derive @xmath110 , which is then substituted into equation  [ incromega ] .",
    "one of the critical parameters for computing the deflection of the ray as well as the column abundance along the refracted ray is the stp refractivity of the atmosphere , which depends on the stp refractivity of its major chemical species ( see equation  [ refrac ] ) . in this paper",
    ", we use the same refractivities for n@xmath129 , o@xmath129 , co@xmath129 , and ar , as in table  2 from @xcite .",
    "note that this table has a small error : the stp refractivity for o@xmath129 from @xcite can be computed for wavelengths above 0.546  , contrary to what this table states .",
    "we are also considering two more species : h@xmath129 and he .",
    "the stp refractivity of helium is computed with the expression from @xcite , described in @xcite . for molecular hydrogen , we start from the formulation by ford & brown ( 1973 ) of the h@xmath129 rayleigh cross section as a function of its rotational quantum number j , from which we compute the cross section , @xmath130 , for an equilibrium h@xmath129 population at 300  k. we then determine its stp refractivity by using rayleigh s formula , @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the wavenumber of the radiation .",
    "since the refractivity of molecules hardly changes in the near - infrared ( nir ) and infrared ( ir ) part of the spectrum , we can pick a single refractivity to represent that entire spectral region with minimal errors . in this paper",
    ", we use the refractivity of various molecules at 1  ( shown in table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "note that the derivation of the refractivity of h@xmath129 from @xcite includes a very slight temperature dependence ( about a 0.3 per cent change in refractivity from 273.15 to 2000  k ) , but we will ignore it here and use the refractivity in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "we can compute the stp atmosphere refractivity for an earth - like atmosphere , considering the contribution of n@xmath129 , o@xmath129 , ar , and co@xmath129 , using the atmosphere composition listed in @xcite . for a jovian - like atmosphere",
    ", we use the mole fraction of helium ( 0.1357 ) measured by the galileo probe , also listed in @xcite , and assume that the remainder of the atmosphere is composed of molecular hydrogen .",

    ", the variation of gravity with altitude makes quite a difference to the density altitude profile and to the resulting column abundances .",
    "indeed , in order for atmospheric model  h to have comparable densities at the upper boundary as models  b , d , and f , its atmospheric thickness must be significantly larger ( see table  [ newtable ] ) . ignoring the variation of gravity with altitude causes a drop in the column abundance of 5 orders of magnitude at that upper boundary , whereas it is less than 1  order of magnitude for the other models .    , using the ae2013 maximum probability parameters of table  [ table3 ] .",
    "see the caption in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] ]    the size of spectral features increases by about 655  km when considering the effect of a non - constant gravity with altitude , or @xmath133 per cent of the stellar radius , which is comparable to uncertainties in recent observations ( see e.g. fig .  4 in de mooij et al .",
    "2013 , and references therein ) .",
    "however , one should then also expect spectral features to change the effective radius of the planet by about 3050  km , or about 2  per cent of the stellar radius , rather than the 0.6  per cent that has been observed to date .    , using the ae2013 maximum probability parameters of table  [ table3 ] .",
    "see the caption in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] ]    we will not try here with our illustrative model to solve the mystery of gj1214b s atmospheric composition but we will merely point out , as done by many previous analyses ( see e.g. bean et al .",

    "2013 ; de mooij et al .",
    "2013 ; kreidberg et al . 2014 ) , that a haze or cloud layer is a possible solution .",
    "indeed , the top of that layer would probably determine the lowest altitude that could be observed , rather than rayleigh scattering , decreasing the altitude range available for formation of spectral features .",
    "incidently , our zero altitude reference pressure would also be correspondingly lower , shifting the densities in our atmospheric model to smaller heights .",
    "we have derived new analytical expressions for the column abundance along a ray refracted by a planetary atmosphere with a constant density scale height , as well as the deflection experienced by that ray .",
    "these expressions were obtained by doing a taylor power - series expansion of the exact integral formulation to the second order of the highest refractivity reached by the refracted ray .",
    "surprisingly , the resulting analytical expression is not dependent on powers of the refractivity , but rather on powers of the dimensionless parameter @xmath134 . although the refractivity is typically small , this dimensionless parameter is not necessarily so , and higher - order terms are dominant in a temperate atmosphere when rays reaches densities larger than about 1 and 0.15  amagat for the column abundance and the deflection , respectively .",
    "we have thus also derived an analytical expression that gives a rough estimate of the contribution from these higher - order terms .    since the scale height of most atmospheres are usually not constant , we have also developed a new numerical algorithm , makexoshell , to trace rays through a spherically symmetric atmosphere given the stp refractivity of the atmosphere and an arbitrary one - dimensional temperature - pressure profile .",
    "we have compared the results of numerical simulations to values obtained with our analytical expressions for a 10  atm 255  k isothermal earth - like atmosphere on a planet with a size and mass identical to earth s .",
    "we have found that there is a better than 0.004 per cent agreement for densities up to @xmath135  amagat , both for the computed column abundance and the ray deflection , except near our upper atmospheric boundary where densities are extremely low , and in the denser regions where the higher - order terms dominate .",
    "the excellent agreement , between our analytical expressions and numerical results , validates both methods simultaneously .",
    "we have built a few simple isothermal atmospheric models ( temperate earth - like planet , temperate jovian - like planet , gj1214b , and hd189733b ) to determine the type of transiting exoplanets where our treatment of refraction , as well as the variation of gravity with altitude , makes an impact on their effective radius . the effects of a non - constant gravity with altitude are more pronounced for atmospheres where the atmospheric scale height is not much smaller than the planetary radius . the combination of a hot temperature with a low gravity and mean molecular mass , creates the proper condition in a jovian - composition gj1214b . if gj1214b s atmosphere had a cloud or haze - free jovian composition , the difference in density profile due to the variation in gravity is sufficiently large that the resulting change in effective radius at high opacities is comparable to current observational uncertainties . it is far less important for hd189733b , and negligible for both temperate planets .",
    "the difference in the computed column abundance and the ray deflection , between our numerical treatment of refraction and simple analytical expressions used in current exoplanet atmosphere retrieval algorithms , increases with the dimensionless parameter @xmath134 , and thus with the largest atmospheric density reached by a ray .",
    "we find that for hot jupiters , such as hd189733b , as well as a jovian - composition gj1214b , atmospheric regions to which spectral features are sensitive are not dense enough for our improved treatment of refraction to make much of an impact .",
    "however , for temperate isothermal atmospheres of earth - like and jovian - like planets , the difference is about 1 per cent at 0.1  amagat , 10 per cent at 1  amagat , and increase dramatically at larger densities , which can impact spectral features .",
    "the column abundance and ray deflection tend toward infinite values , thus forming a refractive boundary layer , as the deepest region that can be probed by transmission spectroscopy and stellar occultation is approached .",
    "this lower boundary occurs where the radius of curvature of a grazing ray exactly matches the radial position of the ray with respect to the centre of the planet , and is only dependent on the density profile of the planet s atmosphere .",
    "rays that reach this boundary will spiral deeper into the atmosphere and be absorbed . the critical altitude discussed in @xcite ,",
    "can never be lower than this lower boundary no matter how close the exoplanet is to its star .",
    "combined with the bending property of the atmosphere , temperate atmospheric layers with densities larger than 1  amagat have an apparent scale height significantly smaller than the actual density scale height of the atmosphere .",
    "this effective scale height tends to zero as rays approach the lower boundary . in transmission spectroscopy ,",
    "spectral features scale to first order with scale height when expressed in term of the effective planetary radius .",
    "hence , spectral features that originate in these dense regions , such as those from dimers and collision - induced absorption , will be much harder to detect .",
    "furthermore , this interesting effect effectively mimics a surface so that even temperate giant planets seem to have a surface in spectral regions where opacities are low .",
    "this effect can only be seen for exoplanets that are close enough to their star that the critical altitude of the planet - star system approaches this lower boundary .",
    "given that it is easier to detect a planet by transit spectroscopy around cooler stars , and that as a result many exoplanet searches now specifically target m - dwarf stars , this is more likely to be indeed the case .",
