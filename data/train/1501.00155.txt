    "in this paper , we study the uniform definability problem of connectives in propositional dependence logic .",
    "_ dependence logic _ is a logical formalism that characterizes the notion of `` dependence '' in social and natural sciences .",
    "first - order dependence logic was introduced by @xcite as a development of _ henkin quantifier _ by @xcite and _ independence - friendly logic _ by @xcite .",
    "recently , propositional dependence logic was studied and axiomatized in @xcite . with a different motivation",
    ", @xcite introduced and axiomatized _ inquisitive logic _ , which can be viewed as a variant of propositional dependence logic with intuitionistic connectives .",
    "dependency relations are characterized in propositional dependence logic by a new type of atomic formulas @xmath0 , called _",
    "dependence atoms_. intuitively , the atom specifies that _ the truth value of @xmath1 is determined by those of @xmath2_. the semantics of the logic is called _ team semantics _ , introduced by @xcite originally as a compositional semantics for independence - friendly logic .",
    "the basic idea of this new semantics is that properties of dependence can not be manifested in _ single _ valuations .",
    "therefore unlike the case of classical propositional logic , formulas in propositional dependence logic are evaluated on _ sets _ of valuations ( called _ teams _ ) instead .",
    "both propositional dependence logic and inquisitive logic are expressively complete with respect to downward closed team properties , as proved in @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", every instance of the intuitionistic disjunction and the intuitionistic implication can be translated into a formula in the language of propositional dependence logic ( @xmath3 ) without these connectives . in this paper , we show that although such a ( non - compositional ) translation exists , neither of intuitionistic disjunction and intuitionistic implication is _ uniformly definable _ in @xmath3 .",
    "this work is inspired by @xcite , in which the weak universal quantifier @xmath4 of team semantics is shown to be not uniformly definable in first - order dependence logic , even though it is definable in the logic .",
    "similar results are also found in @xcite , where it is proved that in inquisitive logic conjunction is definable but not uniformly definable in terms of the other connectives .",
    "another related work is a recent result ( but in a different setting ) by @xcite that propositional dependence and independence logic can be translated but not compositionally translated into what the authors call propositional logics of determinacy and independence , which are logics defined on the basis of kripke semantics instead of team semantics .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 1 ,",
    "we recall the basics of propositional dependence logic and its variants . in section 2 , we define the notion of uniform definability of connectives and discuss its connection with compositional translations between logics . in section 3 ,",
    "we study the properties of contexts for @xmath3 , which is a crucial notion for the main argument of the paper .",
    "section 4 presents the main results : neither intuitionistic implication nor intuitionistic disjunction is uniformly definable in @xmath3 .",
