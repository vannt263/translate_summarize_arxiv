    "<S> each point of the plot has been obtained by running the phase retrieval algorithm for 30 sets of initially random phases @xmath40 and then the best result is chosen ( i.e. the result @xmath41 with minimal value of @xmath42 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we see that even substantial amount of noise allows one to retrieve the wave - function with the reasonable overlap . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ overlaps]b we present an example of a noisy image corresponding to @xmath43 which leads to the squared overlap of 0.83 .    </S>",
    "<S> the finite resolution of an imaging system is another important source of distortion of experimental density images . to analyze its impact on the phase microscopy we have convoluted the previously considered model image with the gaussian distribution . </S>",

    "<S> [ overlaps]c we show the squared overlap of the retrieved wave - functions with the exact state versus @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the overlap drops quite quickly which seems to be not very surprising because broadening of the bragg peaks reduces artificially the coherence length of the system .    </S>",

    "<S> the performed analysis of experimental imperfections allows us to estimate requirements that have to be fulfilled in order to apply the phase microscopy . </S>",

    "<S> the bragg peaks can be much wider than @xmath48 , but then they may possess small additional structures superimposed on the bell profiles which must not be blurred by an imaging system . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the requirement for the resolution should not be weakened in the near - field regime . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of noise additionally worsens accuracy of the retrieved wave - function . </S>",
    "<S> however , the discrimination of the noisy image with the threshold of @xmath49 ( i.e. @xmath50 is set 0 if it is smaller than @xmath51 ) can help significantly . </S>",
    "<S> for example , we have checked that for @xmath52 , if we apply the discrimination in the noisy image ( @xmath53 ) , the overlap is smaller by 0.1 only as compared to the case without the noise .    </S>",
    "<S> the phase microscopy is very useful in detection and visualization of spatial domains . in order to demonstrate it </S>",

    "<S> in order to estimate the areas occupied by the different kinds of the domains we have calculated the squared overlap of the exact model wave - function with the ground states @xmath54 and @xmath55 which turn out to be 0.35 and 0.16 , respectively . in a case of the noisy image the corresponding overlaps are 0.5 and 0.26 while for the convoluted image we obtain 0.28 and 0.11 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these numbers illustrate the accuracy of the phase microscopy in determination of domain sizes in the case when substantial experimental imperfections are present .    to conclude </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated that the phase of a bose - einstein condensate wave - function of ultra - cold atomic gases in optical lattice potentials in 2d can be detected . </S>",
    "<S> knowledge of an atomic density after time - of - flight expansion and a theoretical estimate for the initial atomic density in the presence of an external potential are used in phase retrieval algorithms . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze influence of experimental imperfections on such a phase microscopy . </S>",
    "<S> it seems that the most important requirement is the sufficiently high resolution of an imaging system . </S>",
    "<S> the phase microscopy is particularly useful in situations when the order parameter of a system is complex , for example in the presence of artificial gauge potentials @xcite or in multi - orbital superfluid phase in optical lattices @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the phase microscopy can be applied to observe long range phase fluctuations . in the present letter we concentrate on a bec in a triangular optical lattice subjected to artificial gauge fields . </S>",
    "<S> the phase microscopy allows for visualization of spatial domains whose presence is discussed in the literature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite a different method for visualization of weiss domains has been proposed . in this method , however , phase relation between domains is lost . on the contrary , </S>",
