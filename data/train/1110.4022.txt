    "transport properties of 2d electrons , placed in quantizing magnetic fields , attract a great deal of attention for its fundamental significance . despite a long history @xcite ,",
    "the research in this direction is still active and very surprising .",
    "significant progress has been made during the last decade in understanding the nonlinear properties of the 2d electrons in crossed electric and magnetic fields . in response to both microwave radiation and @xmath0 excitations , strongly nonlinear electron transport @xcite that gives rise to unusual electron states",
    "@xcite has been reported and investigated . very recent experimental studies of the strongly nonlinear resistance in the low frequency domain @xcite",
    "show that the dominant mechanism of the nonlinearity is related to a peculiar quantal heating ( `` inelastic '' mechanism @xcite ) , which may not increase the broadening of electron distribution ( `` temperature '' ) in systems with discrete spectrum @xcite .",
    "microwave studies of this nonlinearity @xcite indicate the relevance of another nonlinear mechanism : electric field induced variations in the kinematics of electron scattering on impurities ( `` displacement '' mechanism @xcite ) , which limits the lifetime of an electron in a quantum state .",
    "the electron quantum lifetime @xmath1 has been measured in many experiments @xcite and is an important property of two dimensional systems @xcite . the standard transport method to measure the electron lifetime",
    "is based on an extraction of the dingle factor from temperature or magnetic field dependences of the amplitude of shubnikov - de - haas ( sdh ) oscillations .",
    "this method works well at low temperatures , at which the dingle factor is nearly temperature independent@xcite .",
    "application of this method to higher temperatures is considered to be problematic , since it involves the separation of unknown , small temperature variations of the dingle factor from strong variations of sdh amplitude , which is limited by the thermal broadening of the electron distribution .",
    "finally at very high temperature , the sdh oscillations are absent and , thus , the standard method is not applicable .",
    "recently several transport methods have been introduced to access the temperature dependence of the quantum electron lifetime @xmath1 .",
    "electric field @xcite and microwave @xcite induced magnetoresistance oscillations show that the amplitude of the oscillations depends on temperature . at @xmath2 variations of the quantum scattering time @xmath1",
    "are found to be temperature dependent . at temperature below 2k the dependence saturates , indicating an electric - field - induced overheating .",
    "the overheating may create very peculiar electron distributions @xcite and is a restriction of this method . in another set of experiments the temperature dependence of the quantum lifetime @xmath1",
    "is extracted from the amplitude of magneto - intersubband oscillations ( miso ) in double gaas quantum wells@xcite and in wide gaas quantum wells with two occupied subbands @xcite .",
    "this method works in the linear response regime ( at thermal equilibrium ) but requires two sets of landau levels and , therefore , does not work for common electron systems with only one populated subband(see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the quantum electron lifetime @xmath1 was recently accessed through the amplitude of magnetophonon resistance oscillations @xcite .",
    "however the method depends on the rate of electron - phonon scattering and , therefore , requires high temperatures .",
    "this paper presents a simple transport method to measure the quantum electron lifetime @xmath1 .",
    "this method works at thermal equilibrium for common electron systems and is applicable for a broad range of temperatures .",
    "the method is based on measurements of a positive magnetoresitance , which is induced by a quantized ( periodic ) motion of electrons in magnetic fields . due to the circular motion",
    ", a scattered electron may return to the same impurity repeatedly , enhancing the total scattering amplitude .",
    "the stronger the magnetic field , the larger the probability for the electron to return to the same impurity .",
    "thus , the scattering rate increases with the magnetic field , giving rise to the positive magnetoresistance . quantitative accounts of these quantum interference effects have been done recently@xcite .    this paper shows a comparison of the positive magnetoresistance , observed in high mobility gaas quantum wells , with theory @xcite . the quantum electron lifetime @xmath1 is extracted from the comparison .",
    "the time decreases with increasing temperature . in the temperature interval 0.3k -15 k",
    "the change of the quantum scattering rate @xmath3 is proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "the behavior indicates a dominant contribution of electron - electron scattering to the decrease of the quantum electron lifetime @xmath1 with temperature .",
    "the data is in good agreement with theory .",
    "both positive and negative magnetoresistance were observed in 2d electron systems @xcite , however the quantum contribution to the magnetoresistance @xcite has not been identified in those works . in a very recent experiment on a two - subband electron system , the quantum contribution to the resistance",
    "@xcite was separated from the classical magnetoresistance @xcite .",
    "our samples are high - mobility gaas quantum wells grown by molecular beam epitaxy on semi - insulating ( 001 ) gaas substrates .",
    "the width of the gaas quantum well is 13 nm .",
    "two alas / gaas type - ii superlattices grown on both sides of the well served as barriers , providing a high mobility of 2d electrons inside the well at a high electron density@xcite .",

    "the hall voltage @xmath15 is measured between potential contacts displaced 50@xmath11 across the electric current .",
    "the current contacts are sufficiently separated from the measured area by a distance of 500@xmath11 , which is much greater than the inelastic relaxation length of the 2d electrons @xmath16@xmath11 .",
    "this ensures that the experiments are done at thermal equilibrium and the distribution of the electric current is uniform across the samples .",
    "the longitudinal and hall voltages were measured simultaneously , using two lockin amplifiers with 10 m@xmath17 input impedances .",
    "the potential contacts provided insignificant contribution to the overall response due to small values of the contact resistance ( about 1k@xmath17 ) and negligibly small electric current flowing through the contacts .",
    "measurements were carried out for discrete temperature values in the range of 0.3 to 20 kelvin in a he-3 insert in a superconducting solenoid .",
    "samples and a calibrated thermometer were mounted on a cold copper finger in vacuum .",
    "magnetic fields were applied perpendicular to the 2d electron layers and sweeps were made at each temperature over the range of zero to 0.7 tesla .",

    "all curves demonstrate a similar behavior . at small magnetic fields ( @xmath180.1 t )",

    "<S> the lifetime of two dimensional electrons in gaas quantum wells , placed in weak quantizing magnetic fields , is measured using a simple transport method in broad range of temperatures from 0.3 k to 20 k. the temperature variations of the electron lifetime are found to be in good agreement with conventional theory of electron - electron scattering in 2d systems . </S>"
