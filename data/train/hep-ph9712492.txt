    ", @xmath9 is the usual representation for the baryon - octet in flavor - space , @xmath10 is the quark matrix , @xmath11 is the nucleon mass , and @xmath12 is the electromagnetic field .",
    "the study of the baryon moments beyond the tree level has a long history which can be found in @xcite .",
    "the approaches and conclusions have varied .",
    "caldi and pagels @xcite pointed out that the loop corrections lead to uniquely defined `` nonanalytic corrections '' to the moments proportional to the square root and logarithm of the symmetry breaking parameter @xmath13 of chpt .",
    "in contrast , the analytic corrections involving integer powers of @xmath13 are cutoff dependent in perturbation theory .",
    "the contributions left after the divergences are subtracted are not uniquely defined in the absence of further dynamical information , and mix with the contributions of higher chiral couplings . since these contributions are expected to be small , they have generally been ignored .",
    "caldi and pagels @xcite calculated what were supposed to be the leading corrections to the baryon moments , those of order @xmath14 , and found that they are as large as the tree - level moments and fail to improve the fit to experiment .",
    "these terms were recalculated by gasser _",
    "@xcite , and the logarithmic terms of type @xmath13ln@xmath13 were analyzed by krause @xcite , but without detailed analyses of the moment problem .",
    "the problem has been reexamined in recent years .",
    "@xcite used heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hbchpt ) @xcite to calculate the one - loop corrections to the octet baryon moments allowing both octet and decuplet intermediate states .",
    "their formal analysis included the nonanalytic corrections of types @xmath14 and @xmath13ln@xmath13 and all the counterterms allowed to that order .",
    "however , they assumed in fitting the moment data that the logarithmic corrections and the counterterms were small compared to the terms proportional to @xmath14 , and included only the last in their analysis . the resulting fit to the data was much worse than the tree - level fit if they used tree - level values for the axial coupling constants , but better if they used the axial coupling constants extracted from one - loop fits @xcite to other data , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , values about 20% smaller than those derived at tree level .",
    "this sensitivity leaves the significance of the loop corrections unclear .",
    "in contrast , meissner and steininger @xcite considered all octet terms ( analytic and nonanalytic ) which are of order @xmath18 or less in chpt .",
    "they did not include the intermediate decuplet states directly , but argued that some decuplet contributions are included because of the way they determined the couplings .",
    "with the counterterms included , they could fit the seven well measured octet moments precisely , and predicted a @xmath19 transition moment of @xmath20 ) to be compared with the experimental value , @xmath21 .",
    "their principal conclusion was that the chiral expansion appeared to be converging rather well .",
    "the problem has also been studied using the @xmath22 expansion by a number of authors @xcite who showed that the @xmath14 terms are leading order in the expansion , and obtained a number of interesting sum rules for the moments .",
    "@xcite again kept only the leading nonanalytic corrections proportional to @xmath14 and the counterterms in their analysis of the moment data , and obtained a good overall fit , but with seven parameters .",
    "finally , bos _ et al . _",
    "@xcite considered the moments from the point of view of flavor su(3 ) breaking in the baryon octet using a chiral counting and treatment of meson masses different from that usually used and again obtained a successful parametrization using seven parameters to describe eight measured moments .",

    "the unweighted fits used in @xcite distribute the uncertainty in @xmath46 over all the moments without changing the one test of the theory , as will be seen below .",
    "we believe that the present procedure is clearer . ] to see this , we define an @xmath47 matrix @xmath48 which has as its @xmath49th column the matrix elements of the corresponding operator in the physical baryon states @xmath50 and the @xmath3 transition matrix element as in table i. the most general column vector of magnetic moments consistent with this chiral structure is then of the form @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a seven - component column vector of coefficients .",
    "the @xmath53 matrix @xmath54 obtained by omitting the @xmath3 row in @xmath48 is invertible , so coefficients @xmath55 can be found which give exact fits to either the seven well - measured baryon moments , @xmath56 , or to the difference between the measured moments and the loop corrections in this sector , @xmath57 . in the second case ,",
    "the moments are again reproduced exactly when the loop corrections are added in .",
    "the only remaining constraint on the theory is that provided by the @xmath3 transition moment .    in the absence of loop corrections , @xmath46 is determined entirely by the seven coefficients @xmath52 through the product @xmath58 with the full matrix @xmath48 , or , equivalently , through the okubo sum rule @xcite @xmath59 the origin of the sum rule can be seen rather simply in the present context .",
    "we can extend the matrix @xmath48 to an @xmath60 matrix @xmath54 by adding a final column with zero entries without affecting the seven baryon moments .",
    "that is , @xmath61 with the same coefficients @xmath52 as determined above .",
    "however , the extended matrix has one zero eigenvalue .",
    "the sum rule is just the inner product of the left null eigenvector @xmath62 with @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "in particular , any set of moments which can be described by the initial seven - component chiral structure must satisfy the sum rule exactly .",
    "the sum rule is , in fact , satisfied rather accurately by the measured moments .",
    "the predicted value of @xmath46 is @xmath65 , to be compared with the measured value @xmath66 .",
    "the discrepancy is at the level of 1.5@xmath67 or 8% of the measured transition moment .",
    "the situation is potentially different when loop corrections are included . while the @xmath14 corrections can be described using only the chiral structures considered so far and therefore satisfy the okubo sum rule exactly @xcite , that is not the case for the corrections proportional to @xmath13ln@xmath13 , a point misstated by those authors .",
    "the logarithmic corrections involve sums of terms of the form @xmath68 multiplied by coupling coefficients .",
    "if the mass dependence of the logarithms could be neglected , the sum rule would hold exactly for external meson masses that satisfy the gell - mann  okubo mass formula . as a result ,",
    "the chiral cutoff @xmath69 drops out of the sum rule , and the violation depends only on the logarithm of the mass ratio , @xmath70 , hence would vanish for equal meson masses .",
    "however , the sum rule is violated for @xmath71 , and the logarithmic loop corrections change the prediction for @xmath46 and introduce new structure in the @xmath60 moment space . of order @xmath72 which affects only the @xmath73 moment .",
    "]    to investigate this point in more detail , we have constructed exact fits to the seven octet moments using the results for the nonanalytic parts of the loop corrections given in eqs .",
    "( [ loopsum]-[g ] ) using the corrected coupling coefficients from @xcite , and have then calculated @xmath46 . for illustration , we will present the results for the two cases considered in @xcite : ( a ) @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , the one - loop axial vector couplings derived in @xcite ; and ( b ) @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , the tree - level couplings . in both cases , we take the decuplet - octet mass difference as @xmath77 gev , and use @xmath78 gev , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and a chiral cutoff @xmath82 gev as in that reference .    although the sum rule is violated analytically , we find that the violation is remarkably small numerically . in particular , @xmath46 predicted to be 1.508@xmath8 for the parameters in case ( a ) , rather the 1.483@xmath8 as required by the sum rule .",
    "the difference is quite small compared to the experimental uncertainty in @xmath46 .",
    "the results in case ( b ) are similar , with a predicted transition moment @xmath83 .",
    "the chiral parameters for these two fits are given in table ii .",
    "it is evident from table ii that the fitted parameters @xmath6 and @xmath5 are consistent with su(6 ) : @xmath5/@xmath6 @xmath84 3/2 .",
    "that is expected in the usual quark model picture .",
    "the axial coupling constants @xmath34 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 also satisfy the su(6 ) relations .",
    "the result that loop corrections lead to only small violations of the okubo sum rule appears to be quite robust . in particular , the changes in the loop corrections associated with different treatments of the meson - baryon couplings are largely absorbed by changes in the fitted counterterm parameters .",
    "we conclude that the theory with all the counterterms present is not usefully predictive at the present time .",
    "the results do not , for example , distinguish in a useful way between the standard chiral approach with the nonanalytic contributions singled out , the approach of meissner and steininger @xcite which includes analytic as well as nonanalytic terms , or the approach of bos _ et al . _",
    "@xcite which allows only corrections that break su(3 ) symmetry linearly , fits the data with just the seven parameters above , and satisfies the sum rule exactly .",
    "the insensitivity of the overall fits to loop effects raises the question of whether there is any evidence that these effects are actually important .",
    "the difficulty is that the counterterm contributions are not calculable in the present theory , yet are essential for getting good overall fits to the data .",
    "a breakdown of the detailed contributions to the moments for case ( b ) is given in table iii .",
    "the results for case ( a ) are similar .",
    "the structure of the loop contributions is of considerable interest .",
    "we will examine this separately for the octet and decuplet cases .      as shown in table iii ,",
    "the contributions of type @xmath0 from the intermediate octet states are quite large , comparable to the tree - level contributions .",
    "the @xmath87 corrections have the same general magnitude , but opposite signs . as a result",
    "there are large cancellations between these two types of nonanalytic contributions .",
    "this contradicts the arguments of chiral perturbation theory @xcite and the @xmath22 expansion @xcite that the @xmath88 corrections should be small , of the same order of magnitude as the counterterms and ignorable relative to the @xmath14 contributions .",
    "in fact , the smallness of the characteristic ratio @xcite @xmath89 of the two types of nonanalytic terms , approximately -1/22 and -1/17 for @xmath48 a pion or a kaon , is offset by very large ratios of the effective couplings , e.g. , 16.1 and 12.7 for the pion and kaon contributions to the proton moment in case ( b ) , and -28.6 and 9.9 for the @xmath90 , and the large cancellations ensue .",
    "there is no indication in this sector that the chiral perturbation series is converging .",
    "the contributions from intermediate decuplet states introduce a new complication , namely the dependence of the results on the octet - decuplet mass difference @xmath91 .",
    "the results are very sensitive to @xmath91 , which is a qcd parameter rather than a chiral parameter .",
    "is described in the quark model in terms of a color hyperfine splitting between the spin-1/2 octet and the spin-3/2 decuplet states . ]",
    "meissner and steininger @xcite argue that the decuplet contributions should be included in the chiral momentum expansion , expand in powers of @xmath92 , and evaluate their couplings to take the resulting effects into account .",
    "unfortunately , this argument requires that @xmath91 be large on the scale of the momenta in the loop integrals .",
    "it is not , with @xmath93 for typical mass splittings @xmath94 mev , and the heavy decuplet argument fails . we conclude that the decuplet states must be regarded as light , on the same mass scale as the octet states , to obtain a consistent picture .",
    "their contribution to the moments is then given by the expressions in eqs .",
    "( [ loopsum]-[g ] ) .",
    "the approximation in @xcite becomes useful only for excited baryon multiplets , and can presumably be used to estimate those contributions .",
    "jenkins _ et al .",
    "_ included the effects of the mass splitting in the @xmath0 terms , but took @xmath95 in the logarithmic contributions .",
    "this introduces very large changes in the latter , but does not affect their final conclusions because the differences are largely compensated through the counterterms .    using the value @xmath96 mev",
    ", we obtain the results for the decuplet contributions shown in table iii .",
    "the logarithmic contributions associated with the decuplet are large and tend to cancel the logarithmic corrections from the octet as suggested in @xcite , but the cancellation is far from complete and all the logarithmic terms must be included .",
    "if we look at table iii from the point of view of a loop expansion , we see that the total contributions from the octet loops in figs .  1 and 2 are considerably smaller than the individual @xmath0 and @xmath1 terms because of the cancellations .",
    "this suggests that a loop expansion may converge more rapidly than the chiral expansion . however , the two types of terms tend to add rather than cancel for the decuplet , and turn out to dominate the final loop corrections .",
    "the counterterms are also quite significant .",
    "we see no convincing evidence that the chiral expansion with only the nonanalytic terms retained is under control .",
    "our attempts to determine whether or not the loop corrections improve the tree - level fit to the moments are also inconclusive .",
    "we have refit the data omitting the counterterms , but with the loop corrections included and @xmath5 and @xmath6 readjusted .",
    "the quality of the fits is essentially unchanged with respect to tree level if all loop contributions are included .",
    "_ find that the fits can be improved by omitting the logarithmic corrections and readjusting @xmath34 and @xmath85 in addition to the somewhat small values quoted for case ( a ) , but this procedure is not justified by the relative sizes of the terms retained and omitted ( see table iii ) .",
    "the foregoing results suggest that the loop expansion may give a more useful approach to the calculation of the baryon moments than the chiral and @xmath22 expansions .",
    "in particular , the results obtained from the different diagrams in figs",
    ".  1 and 2 are all of comparable size when combined with the relevant coupling factors and must be treated together to get meaningful results .",
    "however , loop effects are largely wiped out in the fits to the data when all the counterterms are treated as free parameters . neither the chiral nor loop expansion is usefully predictive in this setting given the experimental and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "it is not possible , for example , to distinguish between the standard chiral expansion and the alternative approach proposed by bos _ et al .",
    "we conclude that it will be necessary to develop a dynamical theory in which the baryons are treated as composite and the counterterms become calculable before the moment problem can be regarded as solved .",

    "<S> the adequacy of the theory will not be established until dynamical models are able to calculate the contributions from the counterterms that largely hide the loop effects in fits to the data . </S>"
