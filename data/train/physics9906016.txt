    "the aim of this paper is to find the spectrum of electromagnetic waves propagating in a strongly coupled magnetized fully ionized hydrogen plasma @xcite without taking into account the ion motion .",
    "we make use of the dielectric tensor of cold magnetized plasmas constructed in ref.@xcite by means of the classical theory of moments .    in neglect of thermal motion",
    "this dielectric tensor reads : @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the transverse and longitudinal ( with respect to the external magnetic field , @xmath3 ) components of the tensor .",
    "we will consider the damping of the modes in question as negligibly small .",
    "this assumption obviously can be verified only experimentally .",
    "the damping can be essential and must be taken into account near the cyclotron resonances . here the thermal motion of the particles leading to the spatial dispersion must be accounted for also . thus our results are valid only far from the cyclotron resonances and in coupled plasma systems with the plasma parameter @xmath4 ( -e is the electron charge , @xmath5 is the wigner - seitz radius and @xmath6 is the plasma temperature ) . for laboratory plasmas",
    "this condition implies the temperature @xmath7 and the number density of electrons @xmath8 .",
    "the electrical conductivity @xmath9 of such systems with strong coulomb coupling is of the order of @xmath10 , so that their effective collisional frequency @xmath11 is at least an order of magnitude smaller than @xmath10 .",
    "similar conditions can also be realized in astrophysical systems ( crust of neutron stars , the interior of white dwarfs and large planets with very strong magnetic fields , etc . ) .",
    "further we will regard only long wavelengths modes for which the condition of a cold plasma @xcite holds .",
    "in addition the frequencies of these modes will be presumed to be much higher than the ion cyclotron frequency , so that the ion motion contribution could be neglected .",
    "the components of the dielectric tensor of a system under consideration were found in@xcite , and within the first approximation in the ratio @xmath12 ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 being the electron and the ion masses ) : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the plasma frequency , and @xmath17 is the electron cyclotron frequency . the positive magnitudes @xmath18 and @xmath19 take into account the coulomb correlations between the particles and are expressible via the second frequency moment of the magnetized plasma conductivity tensor hermitian part@xcite , so that @xmath20 @xmath21 being the partial electron - ion static structure factor , and @xmath22 ( and @xmath23 ) is the projection of the vector @xmath24 on the direction perpendicular ( parallel ) to the external magnetic field .",
    "an analysis of these magnitudes is given in the third section , we mention here only that in the ideal plasma limit both @xmath18 and @xmath25 .",
    "we also wish to emphasize that the electron - ion correlations is the factor which guarantees the existence of nonvanishing parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "notice that the above expressions , eqs .",
    "( [ ecomp ] ) for the dielectric tensor components coincides ( within the first order in the ratio @xmath26 ) with that of the quasilocalized charges model developed by kalman and golden @xcite .",
    "if we choose the cartesian system of coordinates with the z - axis parallel to the external magnetic field @xmath3 , then the dispersion equation of electromagnetic waves propagating in a magnetized plasma takes the form : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the scalar refraction index , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the angle between the wavevector @xmath32 and the magnetic field @xmath3",
    ".    eq.([3.2 ] ) has two different solutions : @xmath33 /2a,\\ ] ] which are usually associated with ordinary and extraordinary waves : two different kinds of waves of a given frequency and with different refraction indices , which can propagate in magnetized plasmas .",
    "these waves are generally elliptically polarized , a wave which propagates along the external magnetic field is transverse polarized ; the ordinary wave is characterized by the right - handed circular polarization , the extraordinary wave is left - handed polarized .",
    "the frequencies that satisfy the relation @xmath34 are traditionally called the plasma resonances .",
    "notice that one of the refraction indices tends to infinity as the frequency approaches the resonance value @xmath35 , while the second one remains finite , @xmath36 .",
    "a cubic equation with respect to @xmath37 can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ 3.3 ] ) .",
    "it determines three resonance frequencies .",
    "this is in contrast to ideal magnetized plasmas ( @xmath38 ) , where only two resonances exist ( we neglect the ion motion ! ) . for the case of near longitudinal propagation",
    "@xmath39 these resonances are @xmath40 ^{1/2}\\right\\ } , \\quad \\omega _ { 3}^{p}=% \\sqrt{\\omega _ { p}^{2}+\\omega _ { \\vert } ^{2}}\\left ( 1+\\frac{\\theta ^{2}}{2}% \\frac{\\omega _ { p}^{2}\\omega _ { b}^{2}}{\\omega _ { p}^{4}-\\omega _ { p}^{2}\\omega _ { b}^{2}-\\omega _ { \\vert } ^{2}\\omega _ { b}^{2}}\\right ) .   \\label{res}\\ ] ]    for the case of transverse propagation we found for the refraction indices poles : @xmath41 ^{1/2}\\right\\ } , \\quad \\omega _ { 3}^{(p)}=\\omega _ { \\vert } . \\label{rip}\\ ] ]    the zeros of the @xmath42 determine the boundaries between the domains of propagation for different waves . from eq .",
    "( [ 3.2 ] ) it follows that @xmath43 , if the coefficient @xmath44 is equal to zero .",
    "we found three zeros , @xmath45 ^{1/2}\\right\\ } , \\quad \\omega _ { 3}^{(0)}=\\left ( \\omega _ { p}^{2}+\\omega _ { \\vert }",
    "^{2}\\right ) ^{1/2}.   \\label{zeros}\\ ] ]    with the poles and zeros determined , and taking into account that @xmath46 , and the relation @xmath47 , the refraction indices can be plotted . in fig.1 the frequency dependence of the refractive indices for an angle @xmath48 is shown .    the branches of propagation ( @xmath49 ) are associated with the eigenfrequencies @xmath50 .",
    "the latter are given in fig.2 vs. wavevector .",
    "the modes @xmath50 are determined by eq .",
    "( [ 3.2 ] ) . since in the present approximation eq .",
    "( [ 3.2 ] ) is the fifth order equation ( with respect to @xmath37 ) , we find five eigenmodes . in ideal plasmas in neglect of the alfvn wave only four eigenfrequencies can be found . from fig .",
    "2 we observe that in the case of a strongly coupled plasma the ideal plasma helicon wave splits into two branches , which we call the strongly coupled plasma whistling sound waves .",
    "thus in strongly coupled magnetized plasma there can exist five eigenmodes : ordinary and extraordinary whistling sound waves , the slow extraordinary , the ordinary and the fast extraordinary waves .",
    "consider now in more details the dispersion of the whistling sound waves at small wavenumbers , i.e. , when @xmath51 . in this spectral region",
    "the dispersion equation reduces to a quadratic equation with respect to @xmath52 . for the case of parallel with respect to the external magnetic field propagation",

    "i.e. when @xmath57 , the solutions of eq.([soundwave ] ) describe the ordinary and extraordinary whistling sound waves propagating in strongly coupled plasmas ,    @xmath58    with the whistling sound velocity @xmath59    the parameter @xmath18 will be estimated in the next section .",
    "for our purposes it is sufficient to make a simple estimate of the frequencies @xmath19 and @xmath60 without including their magnetic field dependence , within the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) , and in the hydrogen plasma model . in this approximation",
    "they coincide @xmath61 and are directly related to @xcite the zero separation value of the electron - ion correlation function , @xmath62 the electon - ion structure factor can be estimated in a coulomb system as @xcite :    @xmath63    here @xmath64 , and @xmath65 are the static electronic and ionic polarization operators ( real parts ) , and the dielectric function , respectively , @xmath66 is the system temperature in energy units .",
    "the ions can be considered as classical particles , and we put @xmath67 for @xmath68 we employ a rational interpolation @xcite @xmath69 constructed to satisfy both long- and short - wavelength limiting conditions of the rpa : @xmath70 and @xmath71    after a straightforward calculation we obtained :    @xmath72    where @xmath73 , and @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 usual notations are introduced here : @xmath78 is the fermi wavenumber , @xmath79 is the brueckner parameter , i.e. , the wigner - seitz distance @xmath5 in the units of the bohr radius , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 , @xmath82 being the fermi energy .",

    "in this note the dispersion laws for electromagnetic waves in cold magnetized plasmas are analyzed .",
    "our analysis is based on the expression for the plasma dielectric tensor obtained from the classical theory of moments without using perturbation parameters .",
    "thus both the cases of weak and strong coulomb coupling are regarded . a qualitative distinction between systems with weak and strong coulomb coupling",
    "is established in their low - frequency electromagnetic wave propagation spectra .",
    "it is shown that the weakly coupled plasma helicon branch splits in strongly coupled plasmas into two whistling sound branches .",
