    "the planck2013 data @xcite showed that the spectral index of scalar perturbations has an expected negative running , whose modulus was in general one order of magnitude greater than the theoretical values provided by slow roll inflation , which could be used to test some theoretical slow roll inflationary models .",
    "the aim of the present work is to present an analytic and numerical study , of the 49 theoretical models of single field , slow roll inflation that are described in @xcite ( see its table 1 ) , that shows that the constrains of the spectral index , its running and the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations provided by planck2013 combined with several data , disfavours all of these models , severely in most cases .",
    "the most familiar ones such as hill - top , natural , plateau and monomial potentials could be disregarded according to these planck2013 data due to the small value , in modulus , of the theoretical value of the running provided by slow roll inflation . in fact , from planck2013+wp+bao:@xmath4cdm+@xmath3+@xmath1 data we show that the deviation from the theoretical value of the running , namely @xmath6 , obtained from the majority of that models to its expected observational value is larger than @xmath7 , and in modulus all the theoretical values are smaller than the modulus of the expected observational one , which means that these models lies outside of the 94.5% c.l . further numerical study has shown that for all of the models either @xmath1 or @xmath0 or @xmath3 lie outside of the 93% c.l .",
    "our study , initially performed from planck2013 data , could suggest that single scalar inflationary theories must be replaced by multiple fields theories , by other ones with a breakdown of the slow roll phase @xcite or by reconstruction techniques @xcite .",
    "another completely different proposal is to abandon the inflationary paradigm in favour of the matter bounce scenario @xcite where the big bang singularity is replaced by a non - singular big bounce , which at this moment , constitutes a promising alternative to the slow roll inflationary paradigm , without the characteristic inflationary flaws , such as the initial singularity which or the fine - tuning of the degree of flatness required for the potential in order to achieve successful inflation @xcite .",
    "fortunately for single field slow roll inflation , the new planck2015 observational data @xcite , reduce the modulus of the running one order , which allows the viability of the majority of single scalar field slow roll inflationary models .",
    "for example , using planck2015+tt+lowp:@xmath4cdm+@xmath3+@xmath1 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 at @xmath10 c.l .",
    "( see table @xmath11 of @xcite ) , and the conservative constrain @xmath12 ( see figure @xmath13 of @xcite ) , for the majority of tested potentials one has @xmath14 , which means that these models are only disfavored at @xmath15% c.l . or less .",
    "moreover , if one introduces lensing , then @xmath6 will be reduced to be lower than @xmath10 , and thus allowing single scalar field slow roll inflation .    however , dealing with the running of the running , namely @xmath2 , when one considers the planck2015 tt+lowp ( resp .",
    "planck2015 tt , te , ee+lowp ) model @xmath16 ( resp .",
    "@xmath17 ) ( see ( 19 ) of @xcite ) , the same methodology that we have applied in the previous cases show that the measured value of @xmath2 is incompatible with the theoretical value provided by single field slow roll , because its measured value is too large for a magnitude that depends on third order on the slow roll parameters , disfavouring almost all slow roll inflationary models studied , 39 out of 49 at 92.8 % c.l . or more .",
    "the main lesson of this work , is the importance of the observational measures provided by planck or other teams , in order to check the viability of single field slow roll inflation . only after a precise determination of their expected observational value and the corresponding deviation we will able to determine which inflationary models could depict correctly our universe .",
    "the problem of the reliability of the observational measures of spectral parameters of the cmb starts with the above paradox of the the oscillating conclusions , from ruling out every model to allowing most of them and back , that the successive planck2013 and planck2015 determinations of spectral parameters support .",
    "we find that these oscillating conclusions can be explained by a bias in the method of fitting spectral values of the power spectrum to the observations .",
    "we believe that new data , and the addressing of this bias , will reduce significantly the observable value of the running of the running and may possibly allow back the viability of single slow roll inflation , in the same way as has happened with the early values of the running obtained by planck2013 and its drastic decrease according to planck2015 .",
    "the units used in the paper are : @xmath18",
    "in slow roll inflation ( see @xcite for a review of inflation ) the commonly used first order parameters are : @xmath19    at the first slow roll order , the spectral index of scalar perturbations and its running are given by @xmath20 where the second order slow roll parameter @xmath21 has been introduced .",
    "moreover , in inflationary cosmology , the tensor / scalar ratio , namely @xmath3 , is related with the slow roll parameter @xmath22 , via the following consistency relation @xmath23    the other important parameter that we will use in this work is the running of the running @xmath24 , given , in the slow roll approximation , by @xcite @xmath25 where we have introduced the third order slow roll parameter @xmath26",
    "in this section we will take into account the planck2013 constrains on @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath27 which are model dependent ( see table @xmath28 of @xcite ) , and the fact that more than @xmath29 e - folds are needed to solve the horizon and flatness problems of gr .",
    "if one does not consider the running and makes the analysis in the plane @xmath30 , then planck2013 data shrink the space of allowed standard inflationary models , preferring potentials with a concave shape ( @xmath31 ) @xcite .",
    "but , it is the combination of the three data @xmath32 what rules out all the standard slow roll inflationary models @xcite .        and thus , assuming that the potentials we consider have spectral index @xmath0 at less than 2@xmath37 deviations and satisfy the conservative bound @xmath38 ( see figure 4 of @xmath34 ) , the minimum of the function @xmath39 reached at the point ( @xmath40 ) is greater than @xmath41 , what provides the bound @xmath42 meaning that plateau potentials such as @xmath43 ( hill - top inflation ( htp ) ) @xcite , @xmath44 with @xmath45 ( double - well inflation ( dwi ) ) @xcite or @xmath46 ( natural inflation ( ni ) ) @xcite , when one considers values of the running at 1@xmath37 c.l . ,",
    "are disfavoured by planck data because for all of them @xmath47 .",
    "in fact , the deviation from the theoretical value of the running to its expected observable value , namely @xmath6 , is larger than @xmath7 .",
    "a distance larger than @xmath7 is also obtained for the potential that leads to exponential susy inflation ( esi ) @xmath48 @xcite and for power law inflation ( pli ) whose potential is given by @xmath49 @xcite , because in this case one has @xmath50 , that is , @xmath51 where we have evaluated @xmath1 , as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath3 at the absolute minimum , namely @xmath52 with @xmath53 , in the rectangle @xmath54\\times [ 0,0.32]$ ] . to be more precise , since power law inflation has no running , the distance to the main observational value is @xmath55 , because in this case one has the bound @xmath56 .",
    "dealing with the kller moduli inflation i ( kmii ) @xcite given by the potential @xmath57 , with higgs inflation ( hi ) @xcite where the potential is @xmath58 and for open string tachyonic inflation ( osti ) @xcite with potential @xmath59 , one always has @xmath60 and one obtains the same conclusions as in esi , i.e. , @xmath61 .    when one considers large field inflation ( lfi ) given by the monomial potential @xmath62 with @xmath63 @xcite , one obtains @xmath64 which means that @xmath65 must be positive in order to have an spectral index with a red tilt and a negative running .",
    "as a first consequence , inverse monomial inflation ( imi ) @xcite is disfavored .",
    "second , from the relation @xmath66 we conclude that @xmath61 . and for radiation gauge inflation ( rgi ) @xcite , whose potential is given by @xmath67 one has @xmath68 , because @xmath69 increases as a function of @xmath70 . then , evaluating at @xmath71 one has @xmath72 giving as a result @xmath61 .    for potentials such as :",

    "since one has @xmath81 , one can obtain the following exact formula @xmath82      however when one deals with arctan inflation ( ai ) @xcite with potential @xmath83 , where one has @xmath84 .",
    "the absolute minimum is reached at the point ( @xmath85 ) , leading to the constrain @xmath86 which means that the deviation to the expected observational value is greater than @xmath87 .    in the case of loop inflation ( li ) @xcite with potential @xmath88 , one has @xmath89 , leading to the constrain @xmath90 when one evaluates at the point where @xmath1 reaches its absolute minimum , namely ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "consequently , @xmath91 .    for mixed large field inflation ( mlfi ) @xcite with potential @xmath92",
    ", one has @xmath93 . on the other hand",
    ", the relation @xmath94 leads to the bound @xmath95 , and thus , @xmath96 .",
    "finally , evaluating at the absolute minimum ( @xmath97 ) we can conclude @xmath98 and thus , @xmath99 .",
    "finally , in witten - oraifeartaigh inflation ( wri ) @xcite with potential @xmath100 one has @xmath101 , leading to the constrain @xmath102 when one evaluates at the point where @xmath1 reaches its absolute minimum , namely ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "consequently , @xmath103 .    to end this section",
    "a remark is in order : first of all , it is important to realize that we have studied analytically only 25 of the 49 models provided by @xcite .",
    "secondly , our analytic results have been obtained bounding the minimum of @xmath1 in the rectangle @xmath104 however , the running could be parametrized with only one independent variable , for instance , the scalar field @xmath70 , which means that the bounds obtained in the rectangle could be improved , because one only needs to find a bound inside a curve inside the rectangle @xmath105 .",
    "the problem to perform this calculation analytically is that this curve can only be obtained explicitly for a few potentials .",
    "the numerical calculations of section [ s : numerical ] are needed to improve the analytical ones .",
    "[ [ analytical - results - from - planck2013lambdacdmralpha_s - model - combined - with - other - data ] ] analytical results from planck2013:@xmath4cdm+@xmath3+@xmath1 model combined with other data ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    the same kind of results could be obtained from other models with running .",
    "in fact , assuming that the potentials we choose have an spectral index @xmath0 at less than @xmath106 deviations and also they satisfy the conservative constrain @xmath38 , we have summarized the results in four tables : table 1 contains the description of three models and table 2 ( wp+high-@xmath107 ) , table 3 ( wp ) and table 4 ( wp+lensing ) contain the deviation of the running , for the potentials we have analytically studied , for each one of the models .",
    "again , the computed likelihoods reflect that the values of the running @xmath1 predicted by the potentials lie all in the same tail of the gaussian distribution .",
    "the leading order coefficient in each regression polynomial is systematically overestimated ( from its true value 0 ) to try fitting the growth of the function , which is actually of a higher order .",
    "this bias cascades down to the lower order coefficients , starting typically with an underestimation of the second to highest order coefficient ."
