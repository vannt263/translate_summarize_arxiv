    "astroseismology is an ideal method to probe the otherwise inaccessible interiors of stars . in case of compact stars their oscillations generally",
    "can not be detected directly via an electromagnetic signal and require the connection to other astrophysical observables .",
    "such a connection is provided by r - modes @xcite which are unstable due to the friedman - schutz mechanism @xcite and emit gravitational waves spinning the star down .",
    "an important property of r - modes is that due to their unstable nature , the saturation of their amplitude at a finite value also dissipates a significant amount of energy that heats the star .",
    "as discussed in @xcite this could be particularly important in recycled millisecond radio or high - energy pulsars , since r - modes with amplitudes that would explain the known spin - down behavior would heat these otherwise rather cold sources to large surface temperatures @xmath1 .",
    "temperature measurements or bounds on these sources therefore allow us to constrain the r - mode amplitude and to distinguish different scenarios @xcite .    for recycled , non - accreting millisecond pulsars detailed x - ray measurements are still scarce due to their faintness @xcite .",
    "moreover , the pulsar beaming mechanism , creating a hot spot on the surface and hard x - ray components from the magnetosphere , complicates the x - ray analysis . because of this an actual surface temperature measurement is only available for the closest source j0437@xmath24715 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately this source spins with a frequency that is too low that r - modes could be present .",
    "other spectral analyses @xcite so far only resolve the hot spot and the hard power law component , but fail to clearly detect a thermal surface emission .",
    "however , even in the absence of an observed thermal surface component such fits strongly limit the size of the undetected uniform thermal emission and one can give upper bounds on the surface temperature that have to hold in order to be consistent with the present data .",
    "moreover , even for sources for which only the total x - ray luminosity is available , the luminosity likewise limits the temperature of a potential thermal surface component .",
    "in addition to the compiled data in the literature we also add a more stringent bound for another source via a detailed x - ray analysis of the nearby pulsar psr  j1231@xmath21411 .    in compact stars",
    "the damping and the heating due to the saturation of unstable global oscillation modes depends strongly on the internal composition .",
    "the same holds for the cooling of the star since certain forms of matter can feature fast cooling mechanisms . in the absence of fast cooling photon emission from the surface dominates at the low temperatures present in millisecond pulsars",
    "however , when fast neutrino cooling , e.g in exotic forms of matter , is present the bulk emission dominates , which introduces additional uncertainties related to the heat transport between the core and the surface .",
    "we analyze both standard and exotic compositions and set robust bounds on the r - mode amplitude in the considered sources by taking into account the various uncertainties in the micro- and macro - physics .",
    "with the launch of the fermi satellite there has been a significant increase in the number of millisecond pulsars that are detected in gamma - rays , e.g. . despite this , the limited spatial resolution of the large area telescope ( lat ) @xcite combined with the low flux of these objects limits even the identification of the x - ray counterparts in the first place , let alone constraining the surface emission .",
    "therefore , apart from a few nearby exceptions ( e.g. psr j0437@xmath24715 ) x - ray data of msps suffer from low count statistics , which shows itself in the uncertainties of the temperature and/or flux values reported . still , the continuous discoveries of mpss led to searches of counterparts at other wavelengths and therefore a wealth of archival data , especially in the x - rays , became available . here , we compile the recently published results of these observations for a number of rapidly rotating , millisecond pulsars .    in table",
    "[ msp_res ] we present the limits or measurements of flux @xmath3 , temperature @xmath4 , distance @xmath5 , luminosity @xmath6 , spin frequency @xmath7 and its derivative @xmath8 for each pulsar , together with appropriate uncertainties , if also reported by the authors ( see the caption for references ) . these values were obtained with detectors onboard chandra , xmm@xmath2_newton _ , swift and other x - ray satellites .",
    "most often only the thermal emission from a hot spot on the surface can be detected .",
    "this fact shows itself in the inferred apparent radius values , which are also given in the table [ msp_res ] . the flux and the corresponding luminosity values presented in table [ msp_res ] only refer to the thermal component , if it is detected .",
    "note that in some cases instead of a blackbody temperature , authors report the temperature values inferred from neutron star atmosphere models , specifically the nsa model . in this model",
    "the neutron star is assumed to have a thin atmosphere in hydrostatic and radiative equilibrium and composed only of completely ionized hydrogen .",
    "with such a model the photon energy dependence of the opacity can be calculated and the effective temperature of the surface emission can be inferred instead of a color temperature .",
    "neutron star atmosphere models generally result in a broader , harder x - ray spectrum than a pure blackbody emission ( see e.g. @xcite for a recent review ) since higher energy photons from deeper layers can also be observed from the atmosphere . therefore fitting the same dataset with such an atmosphere model results in a lower temperature and larger apparent radius",
    "compared to just fitting with a blackbody model . furthermore assuming a mass and radius these models also take into account the gravitational redshift of the neutron star . in table",
    "[ msp_res ] we marked such measurements .",
    "in addition the complementary data compiled in the recent survey by prinz and becker @xcite is shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : temperature - sources ] .",
    "these tables are supplemented by timing data from the atnf @xcite .",
    "the corresponding temperature bounds are compared to bounds for lmxbs @xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig : temperature - bounds ] . as can be seen",
    "the temperature bounds obtained from millisecond pulsars ( red and green full triangles ) are systematically lower than the bounds and measurements from lmxbs ( blue open triangles ) , which are heated by accretion .",
    "in addition there seems to be a mild correlation , that faster spinning sources could be slightly warmer which might point to a spin - dependent heating mechanism in these very old sources .",
    "we would like to note and expand the discussion on two interesting sources , the first one is psr  j1023@xmath90038 , which is a transitional binary .",
    "bogdanov et al . showed that the observed x - ray spectra favor a model which includes a thermal and a non - thermal component @xcite .",
    "the thermal component is fit by the authors with the nsa model and is attributed to the surface emission of the neutron star .",
    "however the derived best fit parameters of the nsa model shows a significant variation in the orbital phase resolved spectroscopy , which is attributed to multi - temperature thermal spectrum , arising due to non - uniform heating across the face of the magnetic polar cap @xcite . for a conservative estimate , we nevertheless use here the total ( phase averaged ) spectral fit since the errors in the phase resolved fits are sizable and even though the colder phase seems to be fit by a thermal spectrum with a typical neutron star radius , interpreting this as surface emission is problematic since the luminosity from this large emitting area would be considerably larger than the luminosity in the phase where the fit yields a small hot spot and which would be expected to dominate .",
    "also , in section [ sec : analysis ] we present a detailed analysis of the archival x - ray observations of psr  j1231@xmath21411to both present it as an example of how the spectral modeling is performed and also to demonstrate a statistical method to put even stronger limits on the surface emission of msps using actual data instead of results from the literature .",

    "as can be seen in all considered sources r - modes are responsible for less than a few percent of the observed spindown rate , as has been found previously for sources in lmxbs in @xcite . yet , for some sources the stringent bounds on the temperatures in millisecond pulsars set even bounds on the spindown fraction as low as @xmath18 .",
    "therefore it is fair to conclude that r - modes are irrelevant for the current spindown evolution of these sources and other mechanisms must be responsible for the observed spindown rate .",
    "this demonstrates the generic property of r - modes that even when their amplitude is so low that they are irrelevant for the spindown , they can nevertheless have a significant impact on the thermal evolution  taking into account that the bounds are saturated precisely when the r - modes are the only heating source .",
    "due to their enormous stability , millisecond radio pulsars would be perfect sources for gravitational wave astronomy @xcite .",
    "they would allow us to perform searches over long time intervals and could therefore yield high precision measurements . in the absence of a direct gravitational wave detection , we have so far only upper bounds on the gravitational wave emission , stemming from their spin - down data .",
    "these spin - down limits have recently been revised @xcite taking into account that the same r - mode saturation mechanism should be present in all of these sources .",
    "this resulted in universal spin - down limits that could be orders of magnitude smaller . nevertheless , the bounds for several sources were close to the sensitivity threshold for realistic searches with advanced ligo",
    ". here we will use the thermal x - ray bounds for millisecond pulsar temperatures and the corresponding r - mode amplitudes to obtain more stringent limits on the gravitational wave signal for sources with thermal data .",
    "the gravitational wave signal in a terrestrial detector is characterized by the intrinsic strain amplitude which is for r - mode emission given by    @xmath119    using the bounds for the r - mode amplitude above yields upper bounds on the intrinsic strain amplitude when fast cooling is absent    @xmath120    the results for the sources discussed in this work are compared to the sensitivity of advanced ligo in fig .",
    "[ fig : strain - bounds ] . the bounds on the gravitational wave strain stemming from the temperature bounds in fig .",
    "[ fig : temperature - bounds ] ( solid triangles ) are compared to the spin - down limits stemming from the pulsar timing data ( diamonds ) .",
    "in addition we also show the corresponding thermal bounds from lmxbs ( open triangles ) @xcite . as can be seen the thermal limits are below the spin - down limits for all sources and strengthen the latter by up to two orders of magnitude .",
    "this means that many of these sources are far below the sensitivity of current detectors .",
    "nevertheless , there are several sources that are not too far below the detection sensitivity of advanced ligo and could be in reach with the combination of the advanced ligo detectors with other second generation detectors like advanced virgo and kagra , or the advent of third generation detectors like the einstein telescope .",
    "upper bounds on the intrinsic strain amplitude stemming from thermal x - ray data ( triangles ) compared to the spin - down limit ( diamonds ) from pulsar timing data for different sets of sources .",
    "the vertical dotted line segments are included to guide the eye which data points belong to the same source .",
    "solid triangles ( red and green ) show millisecond sources with temperature bounds whereas open triangles ( blue ) show lmxb sources .",
    "the larger ( black ) triangle shows the improved bound for psr j1231@xmath21411 .",
    "the results are compared to sensitivity curves for advanced ligo for a coherent search using one year of data in both the standard ( black , dashed ) and the neutron star enhanced configuration ( gray , dot - dashed ) . ]",
    "using recent x - ray data we set stringent bounds @xmath121 on the r - mode amplitude in millisecond radio and high energy pulsars .",
    "these bounds are considerably tighter than the spin - down limits obtained from the pulsar timing data and even lower than those obtained previously for accreting sources in lmxbs .",
    "correspondingly they show that there must be significant damping in these sources",
    ". however , non of the standard damping mechanism that are known to be present in standard neutron stars can provide such strong damping .",
    "an example for such a standard saturation mechanism , that is present independent of the composition , is the coupling of different oscillations modes @xcite , which is insufficient since it can only saturate r - modes at @xmath122 .",
    "the same holds for ekman - layer damping , which can not damp r - modes in fast sources @xcite , as well as for magnetic effects due to differential rotation @xcite , which likewise have no significant impact taking into account the small magnetic fields present in millisecond pulsars @xcite .",
    "therefore , the new bounds strongly increase the discrepancy between standard , well - constrained damping mechanisms and the astrophysical data , so that in absence of such trivial explanations astroseismology becomes an efficient tool to study the internal composition of compact stars .",
    "structurally more complicated stars , involving for instance multi - component superfluids @xcite , could have the potential to explain the data , while even more exotic compositions like ungapped quark matter @xcite or hybrid stars @xcite have already been shown to be fully consistent with the present data .",
    "our analysis also sets limits as low as @xmath123 on the spindown fraction due to r - modes that underline the generic feature , that even when r - modes are so small that they are irrelevant for the spindown of a source , they nevertheless can have a significant impact on its thermal evolution .",
    "the obtained bounds also impose analogous bounds on the gravitational wave strain in current interferometers , like advanced ligo , which rule out the possibility to detect the continuous gravitational wave emission from these sources without further enhancements or third generation detectors .",
    "we also demonstrated a simple yet effective method to put an observational limit on the surface emission of these objects , using psr  j1231@xmath21411  as an example case . in a future study",
    "we will expand this search by taking into account the measurement uncertainties in the distances , radii and the amount of interstellar extinction for a number of pulsars for which there is high quality data .",
    "we note that the nicer mission that will be launched to the international space station in early 2017 ( see e.g. @xcite ) , may have a significant contribution to the search of surface emission of these objects thanks to its large effective area in the soft x - ray band .",
    "we are grateful to sebastien guillot for useful discussions on the x - ray spectral analysis of psr j0437 - 4715 .",
