    "within the framework of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , inelastic scattering between a proton and antiproton is described as a hard collision between their constituents ( partons ) .",
    "after the collision , the outgoing partons manifest themselves as localized streams of particles or `` jets '' . predictions for the inclusive jet cross section have improved in the early nineties with next - to - leading order ( nlo ) perturbative qcd calculations @xcite and new , accurately measured parton density functions ( pdf)@xcite .",
    "d  has recently measured and published  @xcite the cross section for the production of jets as a function of the jet energy transverse to the incident beams , @xmath7 .",
    "the measurement is based on an integrated luminosity of about 92  pb@xmath1 of @xmath2 hard collisions collected with the d  detector  @xcite at the fermilab tevatron collider .",
    "this result allows a stringent test of qcd , with a total uncertainty substantially reduced relative to previous results  @xcite .",
    "we also measure the ratio of jet cross sections at two center - of - mass energies : 630 ( based on an integrated luminosity of about 0.537 pb@xmath1 ) and 1800  gev  @xcite .",
    "experimental and theoretical uncertainties are significantly reduced in the ratio .",
    "this is due to the large correlation in the errors of the two cross section measurements , and the suppression of the sensitivity to parton distribution functions ( pdf ) in the prediction .",
    "the ratio of cross sections thus provides a stronger test of the matrix element portion of the calculation than a single cross section measurement alone .",
    "previous measurements of cross section ratios have been performed with smaller data sets by the ua2 and cdf  @xcite experiments .",
    "jets are reconstructed using an iterative jet cone algorithm with a cone radius of @xmath8=0.7 in @xmath9@xmath10 space , ( pseudorapidity is defined as @xmath11 $ ] )  @xcite . the offline data selection procedure , which eliminates background caused by electrons , photons , noise , or cosmic rays , follows the methods described in refs .  @xcite .",
    "the jet energy scale correction , described in @xcite , removes instrumentation effects associated with calorimeter response , showering , and noise , as well as the contribution from spectator partons ( underlying event ) .",
    "the energy scale corrects jets from their reconstructed @xmath7 to their `` true '' @xmath7 on average .",
    "an unsmearing correction is applied later to remove the effect of a finite @xmath7 resolution  @xcite .",
    "the resulting inclusive double differential jet cross sections , @xmath12 , for @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( the second region for comparison to ref .",
    "@xcite ) , are compared with a nlo qcd theoretical prediction  @xcite .",

    "a simple parton model would predict a jet cross section that scales with center - of - mass energy . in this scenario , @xmath34 , plotted as a function of jet @xmath35 , would remain constant with respect to the center - of - mass energy .",
