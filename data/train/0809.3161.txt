    "a fundamental challenge in hadronic physics is trying to understand the structure of mesons and baryons in terms of their quark - gluon constituents , as given by the underlying theory of the strong interaction .",
    "this theory is known as quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "form factors of hadrons play an important role in this description , because they provide information about the internal structure of the hadron .",
    "one of the simplest hadronic systems available for study is the pion , whose valence structure is a bound state of a quark and an antiquark .",
    "its electromagnetic structure is parameterized by a single form factor , 2 , which depends on @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the four - momentum squared of the virtual photon .",
    "@xmath6 is well determined up to values of @xmath0 of 0.28 gev@xmath1 by elastic @xmath7 scattering  @xcite , from which the charge radius has been extracted .",
    "determining 2  at larger values of @xmath0 requires the use of pion electroproduction from a nucleon target .",
    "the longitudinal part of the cross section for pion electroproduction , , contains the pion exchange ( @xmath3-pole ) process , in which the virtual photon couples to a virtual pion inside the nucleon .",
    "this process is expected to dominate at small values of the mandelstam variable @xmath8 , thus allowing for the determination of .",
    "pion electroproduction data have previously been obtained for values of of 0.18 to 9.8  at the cambridge electron accelerator ( cea ) and at cornell  @xcite , and at the deutsches elektronen - synchrotron ( desy )  @xcite .",
    "most of the high @xmath0 data have come from experiments at cornell . in these experiments , @xmath6 was extracted from the longitudinal cross sections , which were isolated by subtracting a model of the transverse contribution from the unseparated cross sections .",
    "pion electroproduction data were also obtained at desy  @xcite for values of @xmath0 of 0.35 and 0.7 gev@xmath1 , and longitudinal ( l ) and transverse ( t ) cross sections were extracted using the rosenbluth l / t separation method .    with the availability of the high - intensity , continuous electron beams and well - understood magnetic spectrometers at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( jlab ) it became possible to determine l / t separated cross sections with high precision , and thus to study the pion form factor in the regime of = 0.5 - 3.0 .",
    "in 1997 , high - precision pion electroproduction data for values of @xmath0 between 0.60 and 1.60  were acquired at jlab at a value of the invariant mass of the photon - nucleon system of @xmath2=1.95 gev .",
    "the main results were published in @xcite , with an updated analysis of these data published in @xcite . in 2003 ,",
    "the range @xmath0=1.60 - 2.45  was studied at a value @xmath2=2.22 gev  @xcite . at each value of @xmath0 ,",
    "cross sections were obtained at two different values of the virtual photon polarization , @xmath9 , allowing for the separation of the longitudinal and transverse components of the cross section .",
    "the purpose of this work is to describe the experiment and analysis in detail and to present and discuss additional results .",
    "the discussion has been split into two parts .",
    "this paper describes the experiment and analysis , presents the measured cross sections , including the separation into the structure functions , along with a detailed discussion of the systematic uncertainties , and compares them with previous l / t separated data and with theoretical calculations for the cross section .",
    "the paper immediately following @xcite discusses the determination of  and presents the resulting  values , including all uncertainties .",
    "these values are then compared to various theoretical predictions .",
    "this division was chosen to separate the determination of the cross section , with its various experimental issues , from the extraction of  from the measured cross sections , which is model dependent .",
    "if more advanced or other models will become available , new values for may be extracted from the same cross sections .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the next section the basic formalism of the  reaction is presented . in section  [ sec : experiment ] the experiment performed at jlab is described , including the experimental set - up and the calibrations of the spectrometers . the data analysis and a discussion of the various efficiencies that play a role are presented in section  [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "the determination of the unseparated cross sections and the separation of these cross section into the four different structure functions is described in section  [ sec : xsecdet ] .",
    "the results are presented in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "the global features of the separated cross sections are discussed and a comparison is made with the results of theoretical calculations . in this discussion the data from  @xcite are also included . the paper is concluded with a short summary .",
    "the kinematics of the  reaction are displayed in fig .  [",
    "fig : eepi_kinematics ] .",
    "the three - momentum vectors of the incoming and scattered electrons are denoted by @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "together they define the scattering plane .",
    "the corresponding four - momenta are @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the electron scattering angle is denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "the four - momentum of the transferred virtual photon , @xmath15 , is given by @xmath16 .",
    "as usual , the variable  is defined as the negative of the transferred four - momentum squared : @xmath17 .",
    "the three - momentum @xmath18 and the three - momentum vector of the pion @xmath19 together define the reaction plane .",
    "the angle between the scattering plane and the reaction plane is denoted by @xmath20 , while the angle ( in the lab system ) between @xmath19 and @xmath18 is @xmath21 .",
    "the missing energy and missing momentum are defined as : @xmath22 the missing mass of the recoil system can then be expressed as @xmath23 . in the case of the reaction   the missing mass is given by the neutron mass @xmath24 .",
    "the  reaction can conveniently be described using three lorentz  invariants .",
    "in addition to @xmath0 , we use the invariant mass of the virtual photon - nucleon system , @xmath2 , which can be expressed as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the proton mass , and the mandelstam variable @xmath27 .",
    "the latter can be expanded into latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq : def_t } t=(e_\\pi-\\omega)^2 - |\\mathbf{p}_\\pi|^2 - |\\mathbf{q}|^2 + 2 \\hspace{1 mm }    reaction @xmath3 is always negative .",
    "the minimum value @xmath29 of @xmath8 is reached for @xmath30 .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath8 increases for increasing values of  and decreasing values of @xmath2 .",
    "describing the incoming and outgoing electrons by plane waves , the cross section for the  reaction can be written in the one - photon exchange approximation as @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the virtual photon flux factor @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the fine structure constant , the factor @xmath35 is the equivalent real - photon energy , which is the laboratory energy a real photon would need to produce a system with invariant mass @xmath2 , and @xmath36 is the polarization of the virtual photon . the two - fold differential cross section can be written in terms of an invariant cross section as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the jacobian for the transformation from @xmath39 to @xmath40 .",
    "the cross section can be decomposed into four structure functions corresponding to the polarization states of the virtual photon , a longitudinal one ( l ) , a transverse one ( t ) , and two interference terms ( lt and tt )  @xcite : @xmath41 where the @xmath42 depend on , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the dependence of the interference structure functions on @xmath21 features the following leading order behavior  @xcite : @xmath43 and @xmath44",
    ". therefore the interference structure functions are zero in parallel kinematics ( @xmath30 ) , i.e. , at @xmath45 .",
    "the four structure functions can be isolated if data are taken at different values of @xmath9 and @xmath20 , while @xmath2 ,  and @xmath3 are kept constant .",
    "the photon polarization @xmath9 can be varied by changing the electron energy and scattering angle ( the so - called `` rosenbluth- '' or l / t - separation ) .",
    "the angle @xmath20 can be varied by measuring the pion left and right of the @xmath18-vector , and out of the scattering plane .",
    "the two @xmath6 experiments were carried out in 1997 ( fpi  -  1  @xcite ) and 2003 ( fpi-2  @xcite ) in hall c at jlab .",
    "the unpolarized electron beam from the cebaf accelerator was incident on a liquid hydrogen target .",
    "two moderate acceptance , magnetic focusing spectrometers were used to detect the particles of interest .",
    "the produced charged pions were detected in the high momentum spectrometer ( hms ) , while the scattered electrons were detected in the short orbit spectrometer ( sos ) .",
    "the choice of kinematics for the two experiments was based on maximizing the range in @xmath0 for a value of the invariant mass @xmath2 above the resonance region . for each @xmath0 ,",
    "data were taken at two values of the virtual photon polarization , @xmath9 , with @xmath46 typically @xmath47 0.25 .",
    "this allowed for a separation of the longitudinal , transverse , lt , and tt cross sections .",
    "constraints on the kinematics were imposed by the maximum available electron energy , the maximum central momentum of the sos , and the minimum hms angle .",
    "the central kinematics for the two experiments are given in table [ tab : kinematics ] .",
    "in parallel kinematics , , when the pion spectrometer is situated in the direction of the @xmath18 vector , the acceptances of the two spectrometers do not provide a uniform coverage in @xmath20 .",
    "thus , to attain full coverage in @xmath48 , additional data were taken with the hms at a slightly smaller and larger angle compared to the central angle for the high @xmath9 settings . at low @xmath9",
