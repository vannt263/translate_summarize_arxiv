    "a system of three rings may be the result of a binary merger between two massive stars about 20,000 years prior to the supernova explosion ( morris & podsiadlowski 2006 , 2007 ; hereafter mp0607 ) .",

    "mixing of the stellar envelope and core by rayleigh - taylor instabilities within the progenitor star , sanduleak -69@xmath8202 , has been invoked to explain the early emergence of the 847 kev @xmath9-ray line from snr 1987a , which was predicted by shibazaki & ebisuzaki ( 1988 ) to reach its peak around 1.1 years after the explosion , if one assumes a mixed mass of about 5@xmath10 ( ebisuzaki & shibazaki 1988 ) . instead , matz et al .",

    "the general picture gleaned from these studies is of a bimodal plasma distribution present in the region between the forward and reverse shocks ( fig .",
    "[ fig:87a ] ) .",
    "the soft x - rays ( @xmath11 0.3 to 0.5 kev ) are from the decelerated shock front interacting with dense protrusions ( `` fingers '' ) on the inner , equatorial ring , while the `` hard '' x - rays ( @xmath11 2 to 3 kev ) are from a fast shock propagating into more tenuous material .",
    "the soft x - rays appear to be correlated with optical `` hot spots '' , believed to be emission from the shocked fingers , appearing around the equatorial ring , while the hard x - ray and radio images exhibit structures that coincide . between days 6000 and 6200 , the soft x - ray light curve experienced an upturn and departure from an exponentially increasing profile , which p05 interpreted as evidence that the blast wave had reached the main body of the dense circumstellar material of the equatorial ring .",
    "future studies on the nature of the soft x - ray light curve are relevant to the issue of pre - ionization of the supernova ejecta , which can potentially extinguish h@xmath13 and ly@xmath13 emission from the reverse shock ( smith et al . 2005 ; heng et al .",

    "the spectra were binned to contain a minimum of 20 and 30 counts per bin for _ epic _ and _ rgs _ , respectively .",

    "we fit the reduced spectra using models with two components : a low ( @xmath15 ) and a high ( @xmath16 ) temperature component .",
    "two models are considered in xspec : vnei+vraymond and vpshock+vpshock . in h06 ,",
    "the former ( `` model a '' ) is seen to give an excellent fit ( `` reduced chi - square '' of @xmath17 ) to the _ epic - pn _ data . however , the vraymond component of the model , which describes a plasma in ionization equilibrium , is at odds with the belief that both plasmas are in non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ; z06 ) ; we note that park et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2006 ) found the low - temperature plasma component to be in a highly - advanced ionization state ( with ionization ages @xmath18 to @xmath19 @xmath20 s ) and can be described by a thermal plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium .",
    "the vnei model is a somewhat unsatisfactory representation of the physical situation in the post - shock plasma of snr 1987a , because it considers only one value of the ionization age / time , @xmath21 , for the entire plasma .",
    "the vpshock model generalizes the vnei one , as it integrates over portions of the plasma with different ionization ages .",
    "borkowski , lyerly & reynolds ( 2001 ) showed that nei models with a single value of @xmath21 are poor descriptions of the so - called `` sedov models '' ( hamilton , sarazin & chevalier 1983 ) , designed to model thermal x - ray emission from snrs . instead ,",
    "plane - parallel models with multiple temperatures and @xmath21 are good fits to the sedov models , further justifying the preference for the vpshock+vpshock model .",
    "we have utilized version 2.0 of the nei models in xspec , as used by z06 ; the files , with updated `` inner shell processes '' ( z06 ) , were kindly provided to us by the author of the models , k. borkowski ( 2007 , private communication ) .",

    "is bounded by @xmath23 .",
    "consistent with previous studies of snr 1987a in the x - ray , the upper limit to the ionization age , @xmath24 , is _ higher _ for the lower temperature component .",
    "the computed abundances are given relative to their _ solar values _",

    "galactic foreground absorption is fixed at @xmath25 @xmath26 , following h06 . to account for absorption by the lmc",
    ", we take the elemental abundances to be 0.5 relative to their solar values , with the exception of helium which is kept at its solar value . to get a handle on the systematic errors , we consider both the ag89 and w00 tables . for meaningful comparisons ,",
    "output abundance values must be normalized to values relative to hydrogen using the respective abundance table used . in the said version of xspec",
    ", we note that the help file for the vpshock function erroneously lists it as being hardwired to the ag89 tables , even though it is superseded by the abund command ( k. arnaud 2007 , private communication ) .",
    "the errors are computed using the error function for @xmath27 . in general , the dependence of the confidence level on @xmath28 is a non - trivial function ( wall & jenkins 2003 ) . avni ( 1976 ) finds that it depends on the number of parameters that are estimated simultaneously , i.e. , `` interesting parameters '' , and not on the total number of parameters in the fitting function .",
    "for one interesting parameter , the 90% confidence interval corresponds to @xmath29 ; if more interesting parameters are considered , the required value of @xmath28 increases . the @xmath30 level is often quoted as the `` 90% '' confidence interval in xspec analyses of snr 1987a",
    " we wish to point out that this should be regarded with some care .",
    "following z06 and h06 , the abundances of he , c , ar , ca and ni are held fixed  he and c values are taken from lundqvist & fransson ( 1996 , hereafter lf96 ) , while ar , ca and ni ones are from russell & dopita ( 1992 ) .",
    "the vpshock+vpshock model is marginally superior to the vnei+vraymond one for fitting the _ epic - pn _ data  the reduced chi - square is @xmath31 versus 1.31 . for reference",
    ", we note that the calibration spectra for _ xmm _ are typically fitted with a `` goodness '' of @xmath32 . to check for consistency between the different _ xmm _ instruments",
    ", we have taken the vpshock+vpshock fit to the _ epic - pn _ data , folded it with the corresponding detector response and compared it with the _ epic - mos _ and _ rgs _ spectra .",
    "all of the fit parameters are held fixed in the comparison , but the normalization is allowed to vary via a constant factor .",
    "this yields @xmath33 ( _ mos1 _ ) , 1.41 ( _ mos2 _ ) and 1.56 ( _ rgs _ ) ; for the vnei+vraymond model , we get @xmath34 , 1.46 and 1.54 instead . full - fledged and independent fits  like for the _ epic - pn _ spectra  to the _ epic - mos _ data and their corresponding @xmath35 values are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : mos ] .",
    "we note that making more parameters free did not necessarily improve the fits , implying good cross calibration between the _ epic - pn _ and _ epic - mos _ cameras",
    ".    the better counting statistics of the _ epic - pn _ data  and its wider energy coverage compared to the _ rgs _  motivate us to use it as a template for obtaining the temperatures of the two plasma components .",

    "by contrast , the vnei+vraymond fit to the _ epic - pn _ data gives @xmath39 kev and @xmath40 kev .",
    "an nei plasma is at a higher temperature than is reflected by the ionization stages of its elements ; therefore , modeling it as a plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium under - estimates its temperature .",
    "we do not expect the temperatures of the plasmas to be substantially lower relative to earlier epochs , as the hot spots on the equatorial ring continue to brighten . a worthwhile future endeavor will be to obtain @xmath41 and @xmath42 for all of the existing _ chandra _ , _ xmm _ and _ suzaku _ observations of snr 1987a , analyzed self - consistently using the same vpshock+vpshock model with both ag89 and w00 abundance tables .      by integrating the x - ray spectra",
    ", one can obtain fluxes in different sub - bands .",
    "park et al . ( 2004 ) trisected the spectral range into : the 0.3  0.8 kev sub - band to represent the o line features ( `` o band '' ) ; the 0.8  1.2 kev sub - band for the ne line features ( `` ne band '' ) ; and the 1.2  8 kev sub - band for the mg / si lines plus any hard - tail emission features ( `` h band '' ) .",
    "the soft x - ray band is commonly regarded to be in the 0.5 to 2 kev range ( p05 ; h06 ) , a historical convention from the era of _ rosat _ ( hasinger , aschenbach & trmper 1996 ) .",
    "the `` hard band '' is taken to be 3 to 10 kev by p05 .",
    "we integrate the _ uncorrected _ x - ray spectra for various sub - bands and tabulate them ( for 1-@xmath43 confidence intervals ) in table [ tab : fluxes ] . to correct for galactic and lmc absorption , one sets the column densities to zero and then re - computes the fluxes . due to the different abundance tables used and column densities inferred , the absorption - corrected luminosities are model - dependent .",

    "we perform the same analysis for n / s ( fig . [",

    "this is partially an instrumental effect  when the energy resolution is comparable to the spacing of the lines , the line complexes overlap and are only partially resolved .",
    "there is also the issue of choosing a coordinate system in which the fitting parameters are `` orthogonal '' .",
    "hydrogen and helium have no x - ray lines  their abundances are derived from the strength of the x - ray continuum .",
    "when the pair of elements considered are situated close to each other in energy , the hydrogen abundance has to first order a linear dependence on the continuum strength .",
    "thus , the ratio of the considered abundances is tightly constrained as the individual abundances track each other closely . by contrast ,",
    "when the pair of abundances considered are located far apart in energy , this linear dependence of hydrogen abundance on the continuum is broken as the dominant uncertainties are in temperature rather than in flux .",
    "orthogonality is now absent .",
    "to attain orthogonality for such pairs of lines , one has to construct models that directly fit to the abundance ratio considered , an approach which is not explored in this paper .",

    "[ fig : ratioerror ] , we compute the mean error sustained by the various ratios as a function of @xmath84 .",
    "according to avni ( 1976 ) , if three interesting parameters are considered ( see  [ subsect : spectral ] ) , the 90% confidence interval is situated at @xmath85 . in this case , the n / o abundance ratio suffers from errors @xmath86 .      a more revealing approach to analyze the elemental abundances is to normalize the results listed in table [ tab : abundances ] by the `` canonical '' values of the lmc abundances ( hughes , hayashi & koyama 1998 ) .",
    "these were derived using a sample of 7 middle - aged snrs in the lmc ( n23 , n49 , n63a , dem 71 , n132d , 0453 - 68.5 and n49b ) .",

    "( 2006 ) , who argued for the existence of iron - oxygen `` rust grains '' .",
    "the reduced abundance of fe alone suggests that the iron is locked up in dust grains .",
    "however , dwek & arendt ( 2007 ) showed from an analysis of the infrared - to - x - ray flux ratio  @xmath89 versus the theoretically expected value of @xmath90 to @xmath91  that the dust in snr 1987a is severely depleted compared to standard dust - to - gas mass ratios in the lmc , suggesting low dust condensation efficiency or dust destruction in the hot x - ray gas .",
    "in fact , @xmath92 was shown to _ decrease _ with time , which is direct evidence for dust destruction .",

    "such a time scale has in turn been interpreted as the kelvin - helmholtz time of the helium core ( woosley et al .",

    "the favored single - star models require a combination of reduced metallicity and `` restricted semi - convection '' ( woosley 1988 ) , the former of which is supported by our derived abundance ratios .",

    "binary solutions to sanduleak -69@xmath8202 are sub - divided into accretion and merger models ( see woosley , heger & weaver [ 2002 ] and references therein ) .",
    "the binary accretion models allow helium- and nitrogen - rich material to be added to the progenitor star and require the disappearance of the mass donor in an earlier supernova event . in the binary merger scenario proposed by mp0607 ,",
    "two stars with masses @xmath94 and @xmath95 are initially orbiting each other with a period @xmath96 years .",
    "the more massive companion transfers mass to the less massive star only after the former has completed helium burning in the core .",
    "a common envelope ( paczyski 1976 ) is formed , during which core material from the primary star is dredged up to the surface .",
    "the merger process takes a few hundred years , culminating in an initially over - sized rsg , which loses its excess thermal energy over a few thousand years to become a bsg .",
    "the spun - up , rapidly rotating bsg produces a fast stellar wind , sweeping up ejecta associated with the merger , producing the triple ring nebula we now see in projection .",
    "the nearly axi - symmetric but highly non - spherical nature of the rings suggests that rotation played a role in their formation and is consistent with the proposed scenario .",
    "the beauty of the model lies in the fact that it requires no physically ad hoc assumptions  apart from a small kick of @xmath7 km s@xmath47 given to the ejecta to displace the center of the outer rings from their symmetry axis  and makes a number of predictions . in their favored model , mp0607 assert that the outer rings are ejected before the stellar core material is dredged up , while the inner , equatorial ring  the site of the observed x - ray emission  is ejected _ afterwards_.",
    "a relevant consequence of this model is that the dredged - up heavy elements will manifest themselves in the form of x - ray emission lines .",
    "this may explain the trend we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : abundratios ]  the challenge for binary merger models is to reproduce the derived @xmath87 values .",
    "stellar nucleosynthesis can add and _ not _ subtract iron  in the context of the mp0607 binary merger model , we expect @xmath87(fe ) @xmath97 .",
    "we are again led to the question : where is the iron ? if the fe abundance derived is an upper limit on the iron used to form sanduleak -69@xmath8202 , then it is clearly inconsistent with `` standard '' fe abundances in the lmc .",
    "an alternative interpretation is that there is a strong spatial variation in the fe abundance throughout the lmc , such that the iron is sub - lmc at the site of sn 1987a and equal to its lmc abundance elsewhere .",
    "the c+n+o under - abundance suggested in ",
    "[ subsect : abund ] supports such a conclusion .",
    "an improvement over using the hughes , hayashi & koyama ( 1998 ) _ asca _ abundance values is to re - analyze and expand upon their snr sample using _ chandra _ and _ xmm_. existing studies ( e.g. , hughes et al . 2006 ) tend to pick out regions of interest that may include ejecta enrichment ; instead , x - ray emission should be extracted from the _ entire _ blast wave , from which average abundances can be inferred .",
