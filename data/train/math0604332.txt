    "this work is devoted to contraction and asymptotic properties of the homogeneous boltzmann - type equations for inelastic interactions in the maxwellian approximation introduced in  @xcite and further analyzed in @xcite .",
    "we are basically concerned with the boltzmann equation @xmath0 considered in  @xcite and its variants . here , @xmath1 is the density for the velocity @xmath2 distribution of the molecules at time @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is the inelastic boltzmann collision operator defined by @xmath5 d\\sigma\\,dv\\,dw \\label{qweak}\\ ] ] for any test function  @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the postcollisional velocity , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the constant restitution coefficient .",
    "equation preserves mass and momentum , but makes the kinetic energy ( or temperature ) @xmath11 decrease towards @xmath12 .",
    "in particular , solutions to tend to the dirac mass at the mean velocity of the particles @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite for the discussion about the relation of this model to the inelastic hard - sphere boltzmann equation and different ways of writing the operator .",
    "let us just point out that the factor @xmath13 in front of the operator in is chosen for having the same temperature decay law as its hard - sphere counterpart @xcite known as the haff s law .",
    "the convergence towards the monokinetic distribution has been made more precise in @xcite by means of homogeneous cooling states .",
    "they are self - similar solutions of the homogeneous boltzmann equation describing the long - time asymptotics and presenting power - like tail behavior whose relevance was previously discussed in the physics literature @xcite .    to avoid the collapse of the solution to the dirac mass",
    ", the authors in @xcite suggested the introduction of a stochastic thermostat which , at the kinetic level , is modelled by a linear diffusion term in velocity . in this framework , the density @xmath14 in the velocity space obeys @xmath15 existence and uniqueness for given mean velocity of a steady state to have been shown in @xcite .",
    "the convergence of solutions towards this steady state in all sobolev norms has also been investigated and quantified by means of fourier - based distances between probability measures @xcite .",
    "fourier techniques are a good toolbox and have been extremely fruitful for studying maxwellian models in kinetic theory since bobylev observed @xcite that such equations have closed forms in fourier variables .",
    "fourier distances are not only suitable technical tools to study the long - time asymptotics of models and , but also they represent the first liapunov functionals known for inelastic boltzmann - type equations @xcite . in the case of the classical elastic boltzmann equation for maxwellian molecules , there is another known liapunov functional , namely , the tanaka functional @xcite , apart from the @xmath16-functional for which no counterpart is known in inelastic models .",
    "the tanaka functional is the euclidean ( or quadratic ) wasserstein distance between measures in the modern jargon of optimal mass transport theory .",
    "it is defined on the set @xmath17 of borel probability measures on @xmath18 with finite second moment or kinetic energy as @xmath19 \\right\\}^{1/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 runs over the set of joint probability measures on @xmath21 with marginals @xmath14 and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are all possible couples of random variables with @xmath14 and @xmath22 as respective laws .",
    "this functional was proven by tanaka @xcite to be non - increasing for the flow of the homogeneous boltzmann equation in the maxwellian case .",
    "in fact , the tanaka functional and fourier - based distances are related to each other @xcite , and were used to study the trend to equilibrium for maxwellian gases . on the other hand , related simplified granular models",
    "@xcite have been shown to be strict contractions for the wasserstein distance @xmath24 .",
    "with this situation , a natural question arose as an open problem in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 3.3 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2.8 ) : is the euclidean wasserstein distance a contraction for the flow of inelastic maxwell models ? the main results of this work answer",
    "this question affirmatively .",
    "moreover , we shall not need to introduce bobylev s fourier representation of the inelastic maxwell models working only in the physical space .",
    "we shall show in the next section the key idea behind the proof of all results concerning contractions in @xmath24 distance for inelastic maxwell models , namely , the gain part @xmath25 of the collision operator verifies @xmath26 for any @xmath27 in @xmath17 with equal mean velocity and any restitution coefficient @xmath28 .",
    "based on this property , we shall derive contraction and asymptotic properties both for and in subsections [ sec - nodiff ] and [ sec - diff ] .",
    "on one hand , we shall prove that the flow for the diffusive equation is a strict contraction for @xmath24 , while for the scaled equation associated to we shall show that solutions converge in @xmath24 to a corresponding homogeneous cooling state , without rate but only assuming that initial data have bounded second moment .",
    "this improves the ernst - brito conjecture @xcite since it shows that the basin of attraction of the homogenous cooling state is larger -we avoid the typical assumption of bounded moments of order @xmath29- if we do not ask for a rate .",
    "moreover , a generalization for non constant cross sections including tanaka s theorem as a particular case will be proven in section [ sec - gene - b ] .",
    "finally , we shall also show this generic property for the inelastic kac model introduced in @xcite as a dissipative version of kac s caricature of maxwellian gases @xcite .",
    "we start by summarizing the main properties of the euclidean wasserstein distance @xmath24 that we shall make use of in the rest , refering to @xcite for the proofs .    [ w2properties ] the space @xmath30 is a complete metric space .",

    "then , using the weak formulation of the inelastic boltzmann equation , we have : @xmath355 while the first term in the right hand side is simply @xmath356 , the second term is computed by    [ lem - mom4 ] there exist some constants @xmath357 and @xmath358 , depending only on @xmath359 , such that @xmath360 for any probability measure @xmath22 on @xmath18 with finite moment of order @xmath361 and zero mean velocity , where @xmath362    with this lemma in hand , reads @xmath363 where @xmath364 is a combination of second order moments , which are bounded in time since the kinetic energy is preserved by equation .",
