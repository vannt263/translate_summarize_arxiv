    "detecting spontaneous symmetry broken phases in numerical simulations often relies on the measure of correlation function .",
    "for instance , the magnetically ordered phase is characterized by long ranged spin - spin correlations , whereas the superconducting state exhibits long ranged pair correlations in the appropriate symmetry channel .",
    "a fundamental caveat with such an approach is that one measures the _ square _ of the order parameter .",
    "if the later is small , the quantity one attempts to obtain by extrapolating numerical data to the thermodynamic limit is quadratically smaller . as a consequence ,",
    "very large system sizes at high precision are required in addition to an appropriate finite size extrapolation formula .",
    "the aim of this article is two - fold .",
    "we will document a simple and very efficient alternative method to detect magnetically ordered phases in su(2 ) invariant hubbard type models in the realm of projective quantum monte carlo methods . with the enhanced resolution",
    ", we will revisit the semi - metal to insulator transition on graphene s honeycomb lattice , which has recently been under considerable debate @xcite .",
    "honeycomb lattice is a bipartite , non - frustrated lattice , which at half filling and small hubbard repulsion @xmath0 hosts the semi - metallic state of electrons , as in graphene .",
    "when the repulsion is increased one expects eventually a phase transition into an insulating state with antiferromagnetic order @xcite , which due to gapless dirac fermionic excitations being present on the semimetallic side , should belong to a particular , gross - neveu universality class @xcite .",
    "starting from the strong coupling limit and noting that the insulator to metal transition occurs at values of the hubbard interaction lesser than the bandwidth , allows for the proliferation of higher order ring exchange terms in an effective spin model aimed at describing the magnetic insulating state in the vicinity of the transition @xcite .",
    "this point of view opens the possibility that the melting of the magnetic order is unrelated to the the metal - insulator transition .",
    "recent quantum monte carlo calculations @xcite suggested that there is an intermediate spin liquid phase with a single - particle gap but no magnetic ordering , separating the semi - metal and magnetic insulator .",
    "similar results have been put forward for the related @xmath1-flux model on the square lattice @xcite .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite have been challenged by recent studies .",
    "entropy calculations do not favor ground state degeneracy as expected for the @xmath2 spin liquid @xcite . moreover , ref .",
    "@xcite shows that extrapolating from significantly larger system sizes would suggest almost complete disappearance of the spin - liquid from the phase diagram .",
    "the latter conclusion is reinforced here , where we find excellent data collapse and _ identical _ finite - size scaling of both single - particle gap and staggered magnetization , with the distinct values of critical exponents , in accord with the gross - neveu universality class @xcite .",
    "form the technical point of view , our approach is very similar in spirit to an approach considered in ref . .",
    "by introducing a local magnetic field at say the origin , we explicitly break the su(2 ) spin symmetry . in the presence of long range order and in the thermodynamic limit , any field will pin the order along the direction of the external field .",
    "thereby , order can be detected by computing directly the magnetization infinitely far from the pinning field .",
    "the upside of such an approach is that one measures directly the order parameter rather than its square .",
    "this amounts to evaluating a single particle quantity which is often much more stable than correlation functions .",
    "the downsides are three - fold .",
    "one explicitly breaks su(2 ) spin symmetry such that spin sectors mix and it becomes computationally more expensive to reach the ground state . since the computational cost scales linearly with the projection parameter",
    ", this problem is tractable .",
    "the second difficulty lies in the ordering of limits . to obtain results",
    "which are independent on the magnitude of the pinning field , it is important to first take the thermodynamic limit and then the limit of infinite distance from the pinning field . in a practical implementation ,",
    "this ordering of limits has as a consequence some leftover dependence of the magnetization on the magnitude of the pinning field .",
    "this is particularly visible when the pinning field is _",
    "small_. the final drawback is that it is not always possible to introduce a pinning field without generating a negative sign problem .",
    "for instance , in the kane - mele hubbard model @xcite , the spin order lies in the x - y plane . adding a magnetic field along this quantization axis introduces a sign problem . on the other hand ,",
    "the method is applicable to su(n ) symmetric hubbard - heisenberg models @xcite .",
    "the organization and main results of the article are the following .",
    "we will focus on the hubbard model on honeycomb lattice at the filling one half , for which the presence of an intermediate spin - liquid phase has been controversial @xcite .",
    "after introducing and testing the approach in the next section , we will provide a phase diagram of the hubbard model in sec .",
    "[ sec : phase ] .",
    "the data points to the fact that the staggered moment follows rather precisely the single particle gap , when the latter is measured in the natural units of the hubbard @xmath0 , suggesting a direct quantum phase transition between the semi - metallic and the insulating antiferromagnetic phases .",
    "furthermore , an excellent finite size scaling of the data for both the staggered magnetization and the single particle gap is found by assuming the values of the critical exponents @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "these are the values found in the first order expansion for the gross - neveu - yukawa field theory of this quantum phase transition @xcite , around its upper critical ( spatial ) dimension of three .",
    "altogether , the data strongly supports the existence of a single quantum critical point separating the semi - metallic and the insulating antiferromagnetic phases of the hubbard model , with the quantum criticality belonging to the gross - neveu universality class @xcite .",

    "using the representation @xmath20 of the kronecker symbol shows that each fourier component comes with an amplitude @xmath21 so that taking the thermodynamic limit is equivalent to taking the amplitude of the relevant fourier component to zero . with the local field construction , the appropriate ordering of limits for an @xmath22 lattice reads : @xmath23    that is , one first has to take the thermodynamic limit  again to guarantee the collapse of the tower of states in the presence of long range order  and only then can one take the distance from the pinning center to infinity .. however , one can measure the magnetization at the largest distance available on the lattice , thereby tying together the thermodynamic and infinite distance from the pinning center limits .",
    "this procedure can lead to spurious results . ] in other words , the distance from the pinning center sets an energy scale which has to be larger than the finite size spin gap . as an efficient estimator for the evaluation of the ordered moment we thus propose : @xmath24    we have tested the above approach for the hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "ground state calculations were carried out with the projective auxiliary field quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) algorithm which is based on the equation : @xmath25 here @xmath26 is a projection parameter , and the trial wave function is required to be non - orthogonal to the ground state . for @xmath27 the inclusion of the magnetic field does not generate a negative sign problem .",
    "we have chosen the trial wave function to be the ground state of the non - interacting hamiltonian @xmath28 in the @xmath29 sector .",

    "this is consistent with the approach proposed by @xcite where the pinning field is set to infinity on the boundary of the lattice .",
    "if the pinning field is too small , the approach suffers from large and non - monotonic size effects , since the energy scale set by the local magnetic field is unable to overcome the finite size spin gap . under these circumstances the extrapolated value of the magnetization has the tendency of underestimating the order . in this article",
