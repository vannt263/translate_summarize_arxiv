    "thus experiments have been done on the spectrum of the undulator radiation with the nanoscopium beamline at soleil , to ensure good alignment .",
    "one illustrates here an offset optimization while monitoring the spectrum of the undulator radiation on the nanoscopium long section beamline with a window aperture ( 0.2 @xmath18 @xmath83 0.8 @xmath18 ) placed 77 @xmath10 away from the undulator , and a photodiode placed at a distance of 83 @xmath10 .",
    "the adjustment has been done by monitoring the @xmath81 harmonic , since high harmonics are very sensitive to any change in the beam parameters or the undulator characteristics .",
    "the offset was varied , as in moving the girders up or down , while keeping the magnetic gap constant ( 5.5 @xmath18 ) .",
    "placed at a distance of 77 @xmath10 from the undulator with electron beam parameters shown in table [ table12 ] , but with current i= 17 @xmath68 , @xmath74= 7.507 @xmath10 , @xmath75= 2.343 @xmath10 , @xmath76= -0.846 @xmath77 , @xmath78= 0.03 @xmath77 . ]",
    "fig [ fig : offsetm ] shows the evolution of the intensity and bandwidth versus the offset variation .",
    "the best alignment is found when the highest intensity with the lowest half band width are observed .",
    "originally the offset was at 400 @xmath27 and is considered as the reference case for the new calculations shown in fig [ fig : offsetm ] , and the new one is found to be at @xmath34500 @xmath27 .",
    "therefore u18 offset had been adjusted to this value to achieve the best alignment possible as in highest intensity .",
    "these photon beam based alignment techniques are also carried out with electon ( translation , angle ) in the undulator , for a precise knowledge of the magnetic axis .",
    "harmonic as a function of the offset that varied from 0.3 @xmath18 up to 0.8 @xmath18 . ]",
    "undulator tapering technique ( i.e. variation of the peak field along the undulator axis ) is vastly used in the fel to improve its output power , by keeping the resonant radiation wavelength constant , despite the deviation in the energy of the electron beam . as for synchrotron radiation ,",
    "it is one solution to perform an energy scan with a more constant intensity .",
    "one way to modify the field is to slightly vary the gap at the entrance or exit of the undulator , either by closing or opening girders at the extremities .",
    "fig [ fig : taper ] shows the change of intensity of the @xmath81 harmonic as we change the taper value .     harmonic as a function of the taper offset . ]",
    "the highest intensity with the lowest band width is at -10 @xmath27 ; i.e. the girders at the end of the undulator are closed by 10 @xmath27 .",
    "this optimization was useful for the beamline at a precision of @xmath345 @xmath84 and increased the flux by @xmath85 .",
    "the undulator has been installed in the storage ring since august 2011 .",
    "the cryosystem , which is installed out of the tunnel , is connected to the undulator thanks to 2 flexible lines of 15 @xmath10 each via a `` valve panel '' .",
    "this panel was developed by soleil enabling to change the cryosystem while keeping the undulator at cryogenic temperature .",
    "this operation has been done only once in july 2014 where an ice plug blocked the flow in a line between the panel and the cryosystem .",
    "after some tests , it appeared that this ice plug was in the panel which was bypassed until the end of the run . during the tests and the by - pass of the panel , the undulator started to warm - up leading to a beam loss of 4 hours due to a vacuum interlock .",
    "this failure was the only problem on this cryogenic device in 5 years which led to a beam loss .",
    "parameters of the cryosystems have been adjusted with the beam so that the thermal longitudinal gradient remains below 3 @xmath19 , while not decreasing the lifetime of the cryogenic pump .",
    "no disturbance have been observed on the beam due to the liquid flow , whatever the parameters used for the cryosystem .",
    "the undulator is warmed up one or twice a year , during electrical tests .",
    "a 2 m @xmath1 cryogenic undulator with 18 @xmath18 period has been designed so that it suits for the nanoscopium long section beamline of soleil . the use of @xmath1 permits to operate at the liquid nitrogen temperature without undergoing srt effects resulting in an increase of the magnetic field peak , and attain a good thermal stability along the undulator .",
    "in contrast , @xmath2 based cpmu requires thermal resistances distributed along the girders for an operation at 140 @xmath19 .",
    "the cmpu has been built , optimized at room temperature .",
    "it has been further corrected at cryogenic temperature using an additional in - vacuum measurement bench leading to a rms phase error of @xmath86 .",
    "after the installation at soleil storage ring , it has been commissioned for different electron beam filling modes and different gaps .",
    "the thermal behavior of the undulator is stable because the maximum operation temperature variation for all electron beam filling modes and gap variations is less than 3 @xmath19 ( instead of 26 @xmath19 for @xmath2 ) .",
    "effects on the electron beam are in agreement with the magnetic measurements .",
    "the spectrum has been measured on the beamline and shows a very good agreement with the one calculated from the magnetic measurements .",
    "photon beam based alignment for the nanoscopium beamline provides a very fine tuning of the undulator axis .",
    "the spectra are also very nice tools for the taper optimization allowing for a precision of 5 @xmath84 .",
    "we would like to thank joel chavanne from esrf for his kind support , and members of the accelerator and engineering division of soleil led by a. nadji .",
