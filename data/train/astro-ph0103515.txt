    "the well - known dichotomy between _ short _ and _ long _ distance scales derived from old , population ii stars has plagued astronomers for a long time and not even the impressive improvements in measuring distances due to the hipparcos mission ( see e.g. , gratton et al .",
    "1997 ) seemed to provide an universally accepted solution .",
    "this is pointed out by the disagreement existing between results based on field or cluster stars .",
    "methods founded on field stars , like statistical parallaxes or the baade - wesselink method applied to field rr lyrae s , or direct analysis of field horizontal branch stars ( see gratton 1998 ) seem to favour the _ short _ scale . instead , cluster star - based distances , derived from main - sequence fitting to local subdwarfs ( e.g. gratton et al .",
    "1997 ) , or from pulsational properties of rr lyrae s in globular clusters ( sandage 1993 ) , or from the calibration of the hb luminosity level using the cepheid distance modulus of the lmc ( walker 1992 ) , seem to support the _ long _ scale .    following a calibration of the absolute magnitude of horizontal branch field metal - poor stars with good parallaxes from hipparcos , gratton ( 1998 ) suggested that a difference ( at a @xmath4 0.10.2 mag level ) might actually exist between the luminosity of hb stars in globular clusters ( gc s ) and in the field .",
    "this result appeared to be confirmed by the difference in the average magnitude for field and cluster rr lyrae s in the lmc measured by alcock et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and walker ( 1992 ) respectively ( but see clementini et al .",
    "2001 , hereafter c2001 ) .",
    "another indication in favour of this possible difference comes from the latest evolutionary models by sweigart ( 1997 ) , which include some extra - mixing of he and other heavy elements ( c , n , o ) : as a matter of fact there is observational evidence for extra - mixing in cluster red giants but not among field stars ( gratton et al . 2000 ) . on the other side , studies by catelan ( 1998 ) and by carretta ,",
    "gratton & clementini ( 2000a ) put this suggestion to a test using the pulsational properties of a selected sample of field and cluster rr lyrae s .",
    "carretta et al .",
    "( 2000a ) show in a quantitative way that in our galaxy , field and cluster rr lyrae s can not be distinguished in a @xmath5  [ fe / h ] plane : this goes towards excluding the possibility of a luminosity difference .",
    "in fact , the pulsational period - mass - luminosity-@xmath6 relation ( van albada & baker 1971 ) tells us that , at fixed @xmath6 , a difference in the period distribution ( or its absence ) indicates that there is ( or there is not ) a difference in the m / l ratio for the variables . the determination of star masses with the high precision required to settle the question is still one of the most difficult tasks in astrophysics . in this context double mode rr lyrae s",
    "are extremely powerful tools , because their masses can be estimated from the ratio of the two pulsational periods using pulsational models , hence independently from stellar evolution models .",
    "unluckily , the @xmath7[fe / h ] relation can presently be studied in our galaxy only using double mode pulsators in _ clusters _ , since only a handful of rrd s have been so far identified in the _ field _ of our galaxy .",
    "the field rr lyrae s in the large magellanic cloud bar play a key role in this respect , since i ) projection effects are negligible , and they can be considered at the same distance from us and , ii ) plenty of double pulsating variables have been identified in the field of the lmc by the macho experiment ( alcock et al .",
    "1997 , hereinafter a97 ) .",
    "field rr lyrae s in the lmc with good [ fe / h ] determinations may allow the derivation of both an accurate @xmath8([fe / h ] ) ( using single mode pulsators ) and a @xmath9([fe / h ] ) relation , if any , ( using double mode pulsators ) within a homogeneous sample of field variables .",
    "the accuracy required to settle the question of the magnitude difference can be estimated from the pulsation equation of van albada & baker ( 1971 ) , computed at fixed temperature and period : in order to appreciate a supposed difference of @xmath10 0.05 ( or 0.12 mag ) we must detect a @xmath11  ( i.e. @xmath12 ) difference in mass between field and cluster variables .",
    "cox ( 1991 ) using a fixed metallicity and the new opal ( rogers & iglesias 1992 ) opacity tables found masses of 0.65 m@xmath13  for rr lyrae pulsators in oosterhoff type i clusters ( oo i ; oosterhoff 1939 ) , and of 0.75 to even 0.85 m@xmath13  in oosterhoff type ii clusters ( oo ii ) .",
    "since the approximate difference in metallicity between the two oo type clusters he studied is 0.5 - 0.7 dex , we estimate that an accuracy @xmath14  dex in [ fe / h ] is then required .",
    "we started an observational program on the field rr lyrae s of the lmc i ) to derive their average apparent luminosity , and ii ) to determine their metallicities ( in particular for the rrd pulsators ) .",
    "the first part of the program , mostly dealing with new photometric data acquired by our team near the bar of the lmc , is described in c2001 and di fabrizio et al .",
    "the main results are the very accurate determination of the mean apparent magnitude of the field rr lyrae s of the lmc and the derivation of an independent reddening estimate .    from the light curves",
    "so derived we determined epochs to properly time the spectroscopic observations . in this paper",
    "we present metallicities with an accuracy of @xmath15 [ fe / h ] @xmath16 dex for six rrd s in the lmc .",
    "we used the @xmath0  index ( preston 1959 ) , defined as @xmath0= 10[spt(h)spt(k ) ] , where spt(h ) and spt(k ) are the spectral types measured at minimum light , in units of tenths of a spectral type class , based on the hydrogen lines and on the caii k line , respectively . in section 2",
    "we present the observational data and in section 3 we describe the derivation of the @xmath0  values for the 6 stars .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the determination of metallicities ; in section 5 we derive masses of our targets from the petersen diagram , and discuss the mass - metallicity distribution .",
    "summary and conclusions are presented in section 6 .",
    "the macho program discovered about 7,900 rr lyrae s in the twenty - two 40 arcmin@xmath17 fields centered on the lmc bar ( alcock et al .",
    "1996 ) , and published coordinates and periods ( but no epochs ) for 73 rrd s in the lmc bar ( a97 ; differential light curves can be found in the macho website , e.g. wwwmacho.mcmaster.ca ) . since the @xmath0  method requires the acquisition of spectra when variables are at minimum light , new photometric observations were obtained in order to derive complete ephemerides for some of a97 double mode pulsators .",
    "all observations were carried out in la silla , chile , in january 1999 .",
    "four nights at the danish 1.54 m telescope , one of which of photometric quality , were dedicated to johnson v and b photometry ( see c2001 for a complete description ) and immediately reduced to produce light curves and derive ephemerides ( epochs , in particular ) for our targets .",
    "we tried to maximize the number of rrd s observable in a single dfosc ( danish faint object spectrograph and camera ) pointing ( field of view 13.5 arcmin@xmath17 ) , and for the present program we selected 2 positions ( in macho fields # 6 and # 13 ) comprising a total of 9 rrd s ; we refer to them as `` field a '' ( @xmath18 @xmath19 ) and `` field b '' ( @xmath20 @xmath21 ) ; henceforth rrd s in the two fields will be indicated by ca or cb followed by an ordering number derived from tab . 1 of a97",
    ". periods in a97 were used together with the epochs obtained from the new photometric data to properly schedule at minimum light the subsequent spectroscopic observations , done on 2 nights only 10 days afterwards .",
    "we did not use our own derived periods , since c2001 sampling of the light curve of the double mode pulsators ( about 60 data - points in 4 consecutive nights ) does not allow the derivation of periods for the rrd s as accurate as in a97 .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig - cb45 ] the light curve for one of the rrd s based on c2001 data , and phased using a97 first overtone period p@xmath22 . finding charts for the 6 stars here discussed",
    "are presented in figure  [ fig - map ] , taken from c2001 photometry ; maps are 200 arcsec@xmath17 , and the position of each rrd is indicated by a cross ( not in scale ) , right at the center of the fields .",
    "the spectroscopic observations were carried out at the 3.6 m eso telescope , during the nights 1999 january 17 - 18 .",
    "efosc2 ( eso faint object spectrograph and camera ) was used , mounting the ccd # 40 , a loral @xmath23  chip , binned @xmath24 , in combination with grism # 7 ( 600 lines / mm , 3270 - 5240  ) and a 1.5 arcsec wide slit , resulting in a @xmath25 9    resolution ( or r@xmath25450 ) .",
    "whenever possible , the slit was rotated in order to exclude nearby contaminating stars .",
    "sky conditions were good enough for spectroscopic observations , but not of photometric quality , and the seeing varied from about 1 `` to 1.9 '' , with an average value around 1.5 \" .",
    "we observed close to minimum light 7 of the 9 rrd s within these fields , exploiting the previously described ephemerides , obtaining usable spectra for 6 of them ( for one of the stars the spectrum is heavily contaminated by a very close bright object falling into the slit , and we excluded it ) .",
    "identifications and information on these 6 targets are provided in table  [ tab - rrd1 ] .",
    "equatorial coordinates come from the transformation of pixel positions to right ascension and declination , based on about one hundred stars individuated both in each of the two fields and on the digitized sky survey ; they differ only a few arcsec from the ones published in a97 .",
    "the @xmath26 values are intensity averages and should be taken as preliminary , since a new calibration of the photometric data is under way ( see c2001 ) ; epochs of maximum light are given in column 8 .",
    "the fundamental and first overtone periods p@xmath27 and p@xmath22 are taken from a97 . in column 9 and 10",
    "we give the heliocentric julian day of the spectroscopic observations of our targets and the corresponding phases computed using a97 first overtone pulsation periods and the epochs in column 8 . given the faintness of our targets ( v@xmath2519.5 at minimum light ) , exposure times were in the range from 30 to 50 minutes , in order to reach the maximum possible s / n and avoid phase blurring on the pulsation cycle .",
    "typical s / n ratios range from 10 to 30 .    thirteen non variable stars in the open cluster collinder 140 ( cr 140 , clari & rosenzweig 1978 , hereinafter cr ) , observed with the same instrumental configuration , were chosen as spectral type standard stars , to apply the `` classical '' approach to the @xmath0  method via spectral types .",
    "the observed stars are indicated in table  [ tab - cr140 ] , together with their jonhson b , v and strmgren @xmath28 photometry , and spectral types derived both from cr , and from the strmgren @xmath28 photometry ( see next section ) .",
    "the last column of the table gives the spectral type adopted in the present analysis : cr values or the average of cr types with those derived from the @xmath28 , when both estimates are available .    for calibration purposes ( i.e. to check that our @xmath15s s are on the standard system ) we took spectra at minimum light of 6 field @xmath29 type rr lyrae s of known @xmath0 , namely iu car , x crt , wy ant , af vel , u lep and tv leo ; phases were derived from published ephemerides , and checked a posteriori by the spectral types ( see note to sect .",
    "we also acquired 10 spectra along the pulsation cycle ( from phase 0.0 to 0.65 ) of one @xmath30  type rr lyr ( t sex , also of known @xmath0 ) , in order to derive phase corrections for the spectra not exactly taken at minimum light .",
    "spectroscopic data were reduced using iraf and the standard procedure for long slit spectra .",
    "images were trimmed , bias subtracted , and flat - fielded ; spectra were traced , extracted and wavelength calibrated .",
    "no flux - calibration was needed for our goals .",
    "we retained for further analysis only the wavelength range 37505210  , where all lines of interest are located .",
    "the most delicate parts of the whole procedure were spectrum extraction and background subtraction , since the observed fields are very crowded and the seeing conditions were not optimal .",
    "the risk of contamination from nearby objects is high ; this happened , for instance , in the case of one of our targets .",
    "the background subtracted spectra of the 6 program stars are shown in figure  [ fig - rrd ] .",
    "spectral types were derived for our targets by comparing measured pseudo - equivalent widths ( ew s ) of h@xmath31 , h@xmath32 , and of the k line with those measured in the stars of cr 140 .",
    "the pseudo - ew s were computed by dividing the instrumental fluxes within a small spectral region ( @xmath33 ) centered on the selected feature , with the average of those in two comparison spectral regions ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) located on both sides of each feature and defining the local continuum ( see table  [ tab - wl ] ) .",
    "all spectra were shifted to zero velocity before measuring the ew s .",
    "the ( restframe ) wavelength bins used are given in table  [ tab - wl ] .",
    "the spectral types for stars in cr 140 given by cr are quite rough estimates . to reduce this source of error",
    "they were averaged , whenever possible , with the spectral types deduced from @xmath36  colors ( hauck & mermilliod 1998 ) , using the calibrations by crawford ( 1975 , 1978 , 1979 ) .",
    "we then constructed curves calibrating ew s against spectral types using 13 of the 14 stars observed in cr 140 ( see table  [ tab - cr140 ] for identification ) ; star # 17 was excluded because it is not on the main sequence .",
    "finally , we derived the best spectral type for each program spectrum by entering the measured ew s for the program star and reading out the corresponding spectral type .",
    "the final adopted h spectral type is the average of the values obtained from h@xmath37 and h@xmath38 . following preston ( 1959 ) , the observed @xmath0  were simply the difference between the h and ca ii k spectral types , in tenths of spectral types .",
    "results for the program stars are shown in table  [ tab - rrd2 ] , where we give for each of our targets the h and ca spectral types , and the @xmath0  values derived applying both no phase corrections ( as suggested by kemper 1982 ) , or using phase corrections deduced from t sex ( see section 3.2 ) .",
    "the corresponding metallicities are also presented in table  [ tab - rrd2 ] , and will be discussed in sect .",
    "our resolution is too coarse to separate the stellar and interstellar components of the lines , and we did not apply any correction for the contribution due to interstellar absorption , since its effect on the @xmath0  value , hence on [ fe / h ] , is negligible .",
    "gratton , tornamb & ortolani ( 1986 ) , applying the @xmath0  method to the globular cluster @xmath39  cen , employed a correction of 0.2 spectral subclasses ( in the sense of an earlier spectral type ) to their @xmath0  values , based on a reddening e(b ",
    "v)=0.11 mag . in our case",
    "the reddening is comparable ( c2001 ) , and the resulting correction would imply a difference in the derived [ fe / h ] of about 0.04 dex ; this is negligible with respect to the total error associated to the method .    to estimate scale and random errors in our derived @xmath0 s ,",
    "we have compared the values we derived for the 6 comparison @xmath40type rr lyrae s with those given in the literature ( see table  [ tab - rrf ] for individual values ; the comparison is done between our values and the average of literature @xmath0 s for each star ) .",
    "if we apply the phase corrections were inferred from the sp(h ) s of our spectra , and agree with those computed from literature ephemerides in all cases , but af vel and u lep .",
    "these two stars have varying periods .",
    "two ephemerides are available for af vel and the corresponding phases ( 0.58 : eggen 1994 , and 0.63 : lub 1979 ) are slightly later than we derive ; we suggest that both the ephemerides may be no longer adequate .",
    "four ephemerides are available for u lep ( 0.60 : firmanyuk , derevyagin & lysova 1985 ; 0.67 : lub 1979 ; 0.69 : eggen 1994 ; and 0.80 : fernley , skillen & burki 1983 ) , and the phase we derive agrees with eggen s prediction . ] suggested by butler ( 1975 ) , our @xmath0  are on average smaller than the literature values by @xmath41 tenths of spectral types , with an @xmath42 of 1.2 tenths of spectral type for individual stars . since the accuracy of the literature values is of the order of 0.5 tenths of spectral types , we conclude that our @xmath0  are on the standard scale , and have random errors of @xmath43  tenth of spectral type .      before interpreting the observed @xmath0  in terms of metallicity",
    ", we have to apply a correction for the observed phase , since @xmath0  is known to vary during the pulsation cycle .",
    "the exact form of the phase - correction to be applied for @xmath44type rr lyrae s is not known . in their study of galactic double pulsators in the field ,",
    "clement , kinman & suntzeff ( 1991 ) argued that the best correction is the same used for @xmath45type rr lyrae s , since in general the amplitude of the first harmonic is larger than the amplitude of the fundamental mode for double pulsators ( this is also true for our program variables ) .",
    "furthermore , the colors at minimum light of the @xmath44type rr lyrae s are much closer to those of the @xmath45type at minimum than to the @xmath40type ones .",
    "unfortunately , the phase corrections to @xmath0   for the @xmath45type variables are not very well defined .",
    "kemper ( 1982 ) studied the variation of @xmath0  along the light curve of three @xmath45type rr lyrae s ( ru psc , t sex , and dh peg ) .",
    "he concluded that phase corrections are small ( of the same order of the measuring error , i.e. @xmath46 1 unit in @xmath0 ) and should not be applied when the h spectral type is later than a7-a8 , while he recommended to reject @xmath0  estimates from spectra where the derived h spectral type is earlier .",
    "an alternative procedure is to apply phase corrections to the @xmath0  according to the phase variation of @xmath0  derived from a well studied _",
    "c _ type template star .",
    "we have used to this purpose our observations of t sex , and derive ( see figure  [ fig - tsex1 ] ) :    @xmath47,\\ ] ]    where we give the correction simply as a linear function of the hydrogen spectral type and , according to kemper ( 1982 ) , we neglect the small difference existing between the ascending and descending part of the light curve .",
    "this seems a reasonable assumption for the _ c_-type pulsators ( but see figure 1 of smith 1986 ) given the fairly symmetrical shape of their light curves , which all show slow climbs to maximum light , and because spectra of rrc s do not seem to show the hydrogen line emissions and doubling which are the signature of shock waves propagating through the atmosphere , found in the spectra of the rrab s during the rise to maximum light ( preston & paczyinski 1964 , chadid & gillet 1998 , gillet & crowe 1998 ) .    using the above relationship",
    ", we obtain for t sex @xmath0=6.81@xmath48 with an @xmath42  scatter of 0.26 tenths of spectral types .",
    "this value is to be compared with that determined using the procedure suggested by kemper , that is @xmath0=6.28@xmath49 with an @xmath42 scatter of 0.50 tenths of spectral types .",
    "also , for comparison the value given by kemper for this star is @xmath50  ( 6.3 if the star were analyzed as an @xmath40type variable ) .",
    "however , t  sex has the largest variation of @xmath0  with phase among the three stars considered by kemper , so this procedure may lead to somewhat too large phase corrections ( implying too large @xmath0 s and too low metallicities ) . in table",
    "[ tab - rrd2 ] we give the @xmath0  values of our targets obtained using both the kemper procedure ( i.e. with no phase corrections and only using spectra later than a7-a8 ) and the phase corrections derived from t sex light curve . on average , @xmath0  values corrected according to the t sex curve are larger by @xmath51  spectral subtypes .",
    "our adopted values are simply the average of those determined using the two different procedures .",
    "we estimate that uncertainties related to the phase correction are half the average difference between these two estimates , i.e. about 0.6 spectral subtypes .",
    "the @xmath0  values of our targets ( both with and without phase corrections ) were translated to metallicities using two different relations . the first one is given by clementini et al .",
    "( 1995 , hereinafter c95 ) , and is based on their study at high resolution and high s / n spectra of 10 field rrab s , on data adapted from butler ( 1975 ) and butler & deming ( 1979 ) , and on globular clusters having literature metallicities derived from high resolution spectra :    @xmath52 } = -0.194\\,\\delta { \\rm s } - 0.08.\\ ] ]    the relation has been derived for @xmath40type rr lyrae s , however kemper ( 1982 ) found that on average @xmath0  values derived for @xmath29  and @xmath45type variables in gc s agree with each other , so that also @xmath44type rr lyrae s should obey approximately the same @xmath0@xmath1[fe / h ] relation .",
    "metallicities derived from this relation are quite similar to the zinn & west ( 1984 , hereafter zw84 ) metallicity scale for gc s .",
    "the second one is given by gratton ( 1999 , hereafter g99 ) , and recalibrates the @xmath0  index using the new metallicity scale for gc s found by carretta & gratton ( 1997 , hereafter cg97 ) , which differs from zw84 s especially at intermediate metallicities , usually giving somewhat higher metallicities .",

    "both spectra give similar results , and in the following we will be using the metallicity derived from the higher s / n spectrum .",

    "( 1997a , b ) are claimed by authors to reconcile values for masses and luminosities based on pulsation and on stellar evolution theories .",
    "however , as already noted by a97 , several objects ( about 40 of the 73 double mode lmc rr lyrae s , among which our ca 02 , and one of the rrd in m 3 ) fall in the region of the petersen diagram below the 0.65 m@xmath13 bccm96 model , and extrapolation of the bccm96 models would produce rather small masses of about 0.55 m@xmath13  for these objects .",
    "this would not be simple to explain for the stars in this region with measured metallicity : m3 is the prototype oosterhoff i cluster , and ca 02 and the galactic field star viii-58 have similar abundances , intermediate between oo i and oo ii clusters ( [ fe / h ] @xmath25 1.7 on c95 scale , or 1.5 on g99 scale ) . a97",
    "discuss somewhat the problem , also suggesting , but in the end discarding , the possibility of these stars having a larger metal content , hence a mass larger than obtained by the bccm96 models .",
    "since we now have information on the metallicity of 6 lmc rrd s , we have decided to test the dependence of masses derived from the petersen diagram also on metallicity . in order to do this , we derive masses for all objects in figure  [ fig - p0p1 ] for which the metallicity has been estimated , using the most appropriate models .",
    "metallicities for all objects were adopted as follows : in the case of the lmc rrd s we used the @xmath0  values ( this paper ) , as for three mw field rrd s ( aq leo , viii-10 , viii-58 : clement et al .",
    "1991 ) , and converted them to [ fe / h ] using both c95 and g99 relations ; in the case of cu com we used the [ fe / h ] value in clementini et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , obtained from high resolution spectroscopy ( note that at these low metal abundances zw84 and cg97 scales coincide ) ; for the dsph s draco and sculptor we took the literature values ( mateo 1998 ) on zw84 scale , and also converted them to cg97 scale according to the transformation relations provided by gc97 ( see eq . 7 in that paper ) ; for galactic gc s , since @xmath0  values were not available for all of them , we used the [ fe / h ] values available in the literature ( zw84 for all of them , cg97 direct measurements for m 3 , m 15 , m 68 , and transformation to cg97 scale for ngc 2419 , ngc 6426 , and ic 4499 ) . metallicities chosen in the above way should be on a homogenous base for field and cluster variables , since the metallicity derived from the c95 relation ( equation 1 ) is close to the zw84 scale , while that derived from the g99 relation ( equation 2 ) is close to the cg97 one .",
    "since both mass and metallicity affect the predicted petersen diagram , information about the metallicity is required for a proper evaluation of the `` pulsational '' mass . at the same time , for each derived stellar mass the luminosity level can be inferred on the basis of the fundamental period range .",
    "we note that the only pulsation models that populate the petersen diagram are those located in the double mode ( or ) region of the predicted instability strip , that is betwee the theoretical fundamental blue edge and the theoretical first overtone red edge , for each assumed luminosity level . for each mass ,",
    "models with different luminosity levels were computed in order to cover the full range of evolutionary predictions ( which are dependent on the adopted input physics ) for the luminosity of horizontal branch stars and also to take into account evolutionary effects ( rr lyrae evolving from their zero age horizontal branch location ) . as already noticed by bccm96 nonlinear computations",
    "offer the opportunity to disentangle the mass and luminosity effects on the location in the petersen diagram .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig - p0p1 ] , once the mass and metallicity are fixed , the period values identify the luminosity level .",
    "however we consider the luminosity derivation beyond the aims of the present paper .",
    "models with z=0.0001 , 0.0004 , 0.0006 , 0.0008 have been computed for different masses and luminosities , using the same treatment as in bccm96 . in particular , we have used the following models : i ) z = 0.0001 at 0.85 , 0.83 , 0.80 , 0.75 , 0.65 , 0.63 m@xmath13  and with 3 luminosity levels , log l = 1.61 , 1.72 , 1.81 ; ii ) z = 0.0004 at 0.75 , 0.70 , 0.65 , 0.64 , 0.63 , 0.62 , 0.60 m@xmath13  and 3 luminosity levels , log l = 1.61 , 1.65 , 1.72 ; iii ) z = 0.0006 at 0.80 . 0.75 , 0.65 m@xmath13  and two luminosities , log l = 1.61 , 1.72 ; iv ) z = 0.0008 at 0.85 , 0.65 m@xmath13  and 3 luminosities , log l = 1.61 , 1.72 , 1.81 .",
    "a few additional models at z = 0.0002 , 0.001 , and 0.002 have also been computed , but not extensively used to determine masses .",
    "the main parameters of the adopted models ( z , mass , luminosity , p@xmath27 , p@xmath22 ) are given in table  [ tab - mod ] , available only in electronic form .",
    "a subset ( indicated by a star symbol in table  [ tab - mod ] ) of the z=0.0001 , 0.0004 , 0.0006 and 0.0008 models is shown in figure  [ fig - p0p1 ] where , for each metallicity , the upper curve refers to the higher mass , and the luminosity levels increase from right to left ; now the models completely cover the range observed for the rrd s .",
    "an enlargement of the region of interest for our 6 lmc rrd s is shown in figure  [ fig - p0p1zoom ] , where all the lmc rrd s from a97 are also plotted .",
    "we derived masses for our targets as well as for all rrd s for which a metal abundance estimate is available ( either direct or of the hosting system ) interpolating between the set of pulsational models at the four indicated metallicities . for each object",
    "we obtained a table with four mass values , one for each z , and a fit with a parabola produced a quadratic relation mass @xmath3 z. we then entered the empirical [ fe / h ] value for the star ( we do it for both metallicity scales used in this paper ) and derived the mass with the associated error ( based on the error on the fit and an assumed 0.2 dex error on [ fe / h ] ) . in some cases",
    "this procedure was slightly modified because the parabolic interpolation was not completely stable : for ngc 2419 and ngc 6426 we also used the z=0.0002 models ; for cu com , the most metal - poor object of the sample , we found more adequate to use only the models at z=0.0001 , and similarly for ca 48 and cb 61 we used only the models at z=0.0008 , and for cb 49 only the models either at z=0.0006 ( on c95 scale ) or at z=0.0008 ( on g99 scale ) .",
    "results for masses and associated errors for the 6 lmc rrd s , for the mw field rrd s , and for the two dsph s are given in table  [ tab - rrd3 ] , while table  [ tab - rrd4 ] presents results for galactic clusters rrd s .    note that mass values for m 3 are the most uncertain because of the lower precision of the periods p@xmath27 and p@xmath22 given for its rrd s .",
    "however , this could not be an explanation for the rather unusual masses found for the two oo i clusters , since ic 4499 has exactly the same behaviour , but periods as precise as those of the other gc s .",
    "figure  [ fig - masmet ] shows graphically these results ; in panel ( a ) [ fe / h ] s are on c95 scale , and in panel ( b ) on g99 metallicity scale .",
    "the almost flat distribution of masses with varying metallicities , particularly in figure  [ fig - masmet](a ) , shows no indication of a mass - metallicity relation .",
    "in fact , mass and metallicity have an opposite effect on the position of a rrd in the petersen diagram , leading to a sort of degeneracy .",
    "a mass - metallicity relation is only obtained using a fixed metallicity to compute the pulsational models , then using the derived masses in connection with the empirical abundances .",
    "this is what was often done in the past ( e.g. , bccm96 , and fig . 1 in cox 1991 ) , but it implies neglecting the effect of the metal abundance on the position in the petersen diagram , hence an error on the derived mass for all objects whose metallicities differ from the metal abundance adopted in the pulsational model computations .",
    "petersen ( 1991 ) , on the basis of linear calculations , found that the difference in metal abundance between oo i and oo ii clusters produces a very small mass variation , whereas cox ( 1991 ) predicts that the mass of all globular cluster rrd variables should be close to 0.8 m@xmath13  when metallicity is taken into account and the opal opacity tables for the proper composition are used .",
    "our nonlinear computations show that the metallicity effect on the petersen diagram is strong , since it acts in different ways on the fundamental and first overtone periods , and heavily influences their ratio .",
    "this result is in agreement with the predictions by kovacs , buchler & marom ( 1991 ) and cox ( 1995 ) , who also found a noticeable dependence of the petersen diagram on metallicity when the new opal opacities are used in pulsation computations .",
    "in particular cox ( 1995 ) performs computations with z=0.0003 and find a mass increase of ooi rrd with respect to those derived from models at z=0.0001 .",
    "however he reproduces the ic 4999 rrd s location with z=0.0003 , m=0.70 @xmath46 0.05 m@xmath13  models , whereas the metallicity used in our paper for ic 4999 rrd s is equal or larger than 0.0006 , depending on the metallicity scale .",
    "this most likely justifies the larger masses we find for ooi rrd s with respect to cox ( 1995 ) results .",
    "in fact , as shown in figure  [ fig - p0p1zoom ] , our z=0.0002 - 0.0004 , m = 0.75 m@xmath13  models fit the ic 4999 rrd s location too .",
    "further analysis on the metallicity dependence of pulsational models is required , since there is still the possibility that models could somehow overestimate the effect as a result of the adopted opacity tables ( the most recent livermore ones , iglesias & rogers 1996 ; see also the discussion by cox 1991 ) or that , as suggested by kovacs et al .",
    "( 1992 ) the petersen diagram depends not only on the heavy element abundance , but also on the chemical mixture , but this issue is quite beyond the scope of the present paper .    in figure  [ fig - masmet](a )",
    ", the globular clusters of both oosterhoff groups have similar masses , with very similar internal scatter , while in figure  [ fig - masmet](b ) the two oo i clusters m3 and ic 4499 show a ( unrealistically ? ) higher mass than the oo ii gc s , as a result of the different ( higher ) metallicity scale adopted .",
    "indeed , some weak hints of a mass metallicity relation with larger masses at higher metal abundances could be seen also among the oo i field and cluster rd s in figure  [ fig - masmet](a ) .",
    "whether this finding might imply an actual difference between gc s , or is simply to impute to a too high sensitivity of the model - derived masses on metallicity , not well tuned yet , is an open question .",
    "the offset between the two metallicity scales is about 0.2 dex at the typical metallicity of the oo i clusters ; comparison between figure  [ fig - masmet](a ) and figure  [ fig - masmet](b ) tells quite clearly that a systematic error of 0.2 dex in the metallicity of the oo i clusters , through the effect on the rrd s masses derived from pulsational models , goes in the direction of producing a mass - metallicity relation ( of any kind ) that might actually not be there .",
    "the arrows in figure  [ fig - masmet ] show graphically the variation of derived masses for a 0.2 dex increase in the assumed [ fe / h ] , comparable to the error associated to abundances obtained with the @xmath0  method .",
    "the derived masses are not in contrast to values expected from stellar evolutionary models for an age of 10 - 14 gyr , and no extensive mass loss on the red giant branch .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig - masmet ] , where the lines represent the mass at the rgb tip for ages of 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , and 14 gyr ; they are taken from the evolutionary models by bertelli et al .",
    "( 1994 ) for z=0.004 , 0.001 , 0.0004 , and by girardi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for z=0.0001 , however any other choice of isochrone sets would produce similar results . within the errorbars ( see tables  [ tab - rrd3 ] , and  [ tab - rrd4 ] ) all objects in figure  [ fig - masmet](a ) are well consistent with the plotted isochrone sets . only the two most metal rich rrd s of the lmc lie above the 10 gyr isochrone",
    "; however , the large errorbar associated to their mass estimates on one hand , and/or the possibility for these field objects to be slightly younger that 10 gyr might account for their position in the figure . figure  [ fig - masmet](b ) is more difficult to explain , since rrd in both m3 and ic4499 lie well above the 10 gyr isochrone , even taking into account errorbars , and ages younger than 10 gyr might be at the lower limit of the acceptable values for these gcs .",
    "this could be due to uncertainty in the pulsational masses : models could have a too high sensitivity to abundances at these relatively large metallicities , either through the total heavy element abundance or the adopted chemical mixture .",
    "another possibility is a too large abundance assumed for these clusters ( e.g. , an overestimate of about 0.15 dex in cg97 computations for intermediate - metallicity clusters ) .",
    "this last possibility can be checked for m 3 , which has also been studied with high resolution spectroscopy and fine abundance analysis by kraft et al .",
    "( 1992 ) ; they find [ fe / h]=@xmath68 , to be compared to [ fe / h]=@xmath69 in cg97 . but also adopting the kraft et al .",
    "value , the pulsational masses are larger than for the oo ii clusters .",
    "furthermore , work on high resolution spectra of turn off stars in ngc 6752 , obtained with uves on the vlt ( gratton et al .",
    "2001 ) , obtains the same iron abundance already derived for giants in cg97 for this intermediate metallicity cluster ( [ fe / h]=@xmath70 ) .",
    "small overestimates may be present , but do not seem to explain completely the effect noted in figure  [ fig - masmet](b ) . finally , we wish to note that , based on a recent study of m 92 by king , stephens & boesgaard ( 1998 ) , and on spectra of turn off stars in ngc 6397 ( gratton et al .",
    "2001 ) , it may be necessary to reassess also the low metallicity end of the gc scale , in the sense of lower abundances : this would go in the direction of increasing the metallicity difference between oo i and oo ii clusters . discussing",
    "the validity of metallcity scales is outside the scope of the present paper , and we prefer to derive masses using different ones , leaving to the reader the final choice about which one to believe better .    in any case , the major result here is that masses of oo i and oo ii clusters do not significantly differ , or , if they do , they differ in the sense of oo i gc s having higher masses , contrary to what usually accepted .",
    "this stems from the use of appropriate metallicities in the pulsational models .",
    "this result is summarized in table  [ tab - rrd5 ] where we also compare the average mass values derived for the field and cluster variables of differing oosterhoff types , adopting the two metallicity scales , separately .",
    "the cut between oosterhoff types was set at [ fe / h]=@xmath11.7 and @xmath11.5 in zw84 and cg97 respectively , with the oo ii variables being at [ fe / h]@xmath711.7 ( @xmath11.5 ) .",
    "the field rrd s have a larger scatter , both in metallicity and in mass ; however most stars lie in the same region of the diagram occupied by the globular cluster stars .",
    "the bulk of the field galactic rrd s as well as rrd s in draco and sculptor concentrate in the low metallicity region occupied by the oo ii clusters , while almost all of the lmc rrd s in our sample are in the region of the oo i clusters , or extend further towards metallicity values which have no counterparts in our galaxy or in the two dsph s where rrd s had been found in the past .",
    "this confirms c2001 finding that pulsational properties of the rr lyrae variables in their observed regions of the lmc bar seem to follow the period - amplitude relation of oo i clusters like m 3 .",
    "finally note that , no matter which metallicity scale is adopted , cluster and field stars of similar metallicity and/or oosterhoff type do not show any systematic difference in the derived mass .",
    "in order to investigate the possibility of a systematic difference in the mass and mass - metallicity distribution for rr lyrae in globular clusters and in the general field , we have used the preston @xmath0  method to derive metallicities for 6 rrd s ( double pulsating variables ) in the bar of the lmc . we have then combined these values with literature data for four field galactic rrd s , making up a total of 10 field rrd s whose metallicity has been directly measured , and with data for rrd s in the draco and sculptor galaxies , for which the same metallicity as the host galaxy has been assumed .",
    "for these stars , pulsational masses were derived using an extension of the bccm96 models to enlarged mass and metallicity ranges , purposefully computed for this paper .",
    "the same procedure has been applied to globular clusters rrd s , both of oo i and oo ii types , similarly finding their masses .      since field and cluster rr lyrae s also obey the same mass - luminosity - metallicity relation ( catelan 1998 , carretta et al .",
    "2000a ) , we conclude that they should also obey the same luminosity - metallicity relation , and that there is no difference in luminosity between field and cluster rr lyrae s .",
    "this result implies that results found for field rr lyrae can be safely used also to derive properties of cluster rr lyrae s , like e.g. the absolute luminosity and the absolute luminosity - metallicity relation .",
