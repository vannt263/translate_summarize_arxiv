    "the accurate theoretical understanding of dynamical systems in the form of reaction - diffusion processes running on the top of complex networks rates among the hottest issues in complex network theory  @xcite .",
    "much effort has been devoted to the criticality of the ensuing absorbing state phase transition observed in the contact process ( cp )  @xcite and in the susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis )   @xcite models , mainly based on perturbative approaches around the transition point  @xcite , even though non - perturbative analyses have recently been performed  @xcite .",
    "the heterogeneous mean - field ( hmf ) approach for dynamical processes on complex networks has become widespread in the last years .",
    "this theory , formerly conceived to investigate the sis dynamics on complex networks  @xcite , assumes that the number of connections of a vertex ( the vertex degree ) is the quantity relevant to determine its state , neglects all dynamical correlations as well as the actual structure of the network . on the other hand ,",
    "the quenched mean - field ( qmf ) theory  @xcite still neglects dynamical correlations but the actual quenched structure of the network is explicitly taken into account by means of the adjacency matrix @xmath0 that contains the complete information of the connection among vertices  @xcite .",
    "more recently , semi - analytic methods including dynamical fluctuations  @xcite and heterogeneous pair - approximations  @xcite have appeared as more accurate alternatives to hmf theory .    the cp  @xcite is the simplest reaction - diffusion process exhibiting a transition between an active and a frozen ( absorbing ) phase  @xcite .",
    "the cp dynamics investigated in the present work is defined as follows  @xcite : a vertex @xmath1 of an arbitrary unweighted graph can be occupied ( @xmath2 ) or empty ( @xmath3 ) . at a rate @xmath4 , an occupied vertex tries to create an offspring in a randomly chosen nearest - neighbor , what happens only if it is empty .",
    "an occupied vertex spontaneously disappears at rate @xmath5 ( this rate fixes the time unit ) .",
    "notice that in the sis dynamics an occupied vertex creates ( ` infects ' in the epidemiological jargon ) an offspring in each empty nearest neighbor at rate @xmath4 .",
    "even being equivalent for strictly homogeneous graphs ( @xmath6 ) , these models are very different for heterogeneous substrates ( see discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . however , in both models the creation of particles is a catalytic process occurring exclusively in pairs of empty - occupied vertices , implying that the state devoid from particles is a fixed point of the dynamics and is called absorbing state .",
    "after an intense discussion  @xcite , the hmf theory showed up as the best available approach to describe scaling exponents associated to the phase transition of the cp on networks  @xcite .",
    "however , some important questions remained unanswered .",
    "the transition point @xmath7 predicted by the hmf theory  @xcite does not reflect the dependence on the degree distribution observed in simulations  @xcite .",
    "most intriguingly , it was observed a good accordance between simulations and a heuristic modification of the strictly homogeneous pair - approximation ( hpa ) ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) where the fixed vertex degree is replaced by the average degree of the network  @xcite : @xmath8 finally , sub - leading corrections to the finite - size scaling , undetected by the one - vertex hmf theory , are quantitatively relevant for the analysis of highly heterogeneous networks , for which deviations from the theoretical finite - size scaling exponents were reported  @xcite .",
    "dynamical correlations represent an important factor to ascertain the accuracy of the analytical results .",
    "the simplest way to explicitly consider dynamical correlations is by means of a pair - approximation  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we present a pair hmf approximation for the cp on heterogeneous networks .",
    "we show that this theory yields great improvements in relation to the one - vertex counterpart but , however , may be farther from the simulation thresholds than eq .",
    "( [ eq : lbc_hom ] ) .",
    "this apparent contradiction is solved showing that the higher - order homogeneous cluster approximations overestimate the actual transition point implying that the proximity is only a coincidence .",
    "we also show that pair hmf theory yields the same critical exponents as the one - vertex hmf theory , but with different corrections to the scaling .",
    "these corrections allow an almost perfect match with simulations constituting a great improvement in relation to the one - vertex mean - field theories  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : pair hmf theory is proposed and the transcendental equation that gives the transition points is derived in section [ sec : phmf ] .",
    "the numerical analyses of the thresholds and the comparisons with quasi - stationary simulations are presented in section  [ sec : numerics ] .",
    "the critical exponents are analytically determined and compared with simulations in section  [ sec : critical ] .",
    "our concluding remarks are drawn in section  [ sec : conclu ] .",
    "in this section , we develop the pair hmf theory where the evolution of the system is given by the average behavior of vertices with the same degree .",
