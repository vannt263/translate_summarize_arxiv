    "[ rl2l ] shows that the beam effects do not seem to influence the @xmath9/@xmath3 ratio , and that for any plausible gas excitation gradient ( i.e. hotter gas confined in the center ) such effects would show in the @xmath8 ratio as well , but fig .",
    "[ r2l ] shows no evidence that more distant objects have smaller values of @xmath8 ( see   [ pb ] ) .",
    "in addition , this effect would be expected to produce an increase rather than a decrease in @xmath9/@xmath3 with increasing @xmath3 because of the strong sensitivity of @xmath3 to dust temperature .",

    "[ lco2lfir ] shows a trend that the @xmath9/@xmath3 ratio decreases with increasing dust temperature which is indicated by the two different fir color ranges .",
    "this implies that the galaxies of the slugs sample which have higher luminosity is because they have a higher temperature in addition to simply more dust and gas , which would alone yield a linear relation between @xmath9 and @xmath3 .",
    "the correlation found between @xmath70 and dust temperature by dunne et al .",
    "( 2000 ) also support this argument .",
    "this effect is consistent with the systematically higher @xmath63 s deduced for such objects , with the warmer iras colors , and with the saturation of the @xmath8 ratio at high @xmath63 s ( see fig .",

    "the disperson in the fit is about a factor of 3 .",
    "the slope based on a linear fit in the log - log plane yields 1.4 @xmath11 0.3 .",
    "this value is consistent with the schmidt law applied to the circumnuclear starbursts @xcite , though the uncertainty in the slope is too high to obtain a definitive value for the index .",
    "a possible reason for this is that our result refers to different regions in different galaxies , depending on the projected beamsize , whereas the work by kennicutt and others consistently refer to disk - averaged parameters .",
    "the schmidt law involves h i+h@xmath12 , but ignoring h i gas , which averages about 30% of the total gas mass measured within a 15@xmath7 beam ( see   [ gasratio ] ) , is most likely not the cause of the scatter seen in fig .",

    "the lack of correlation of @xmath8 with properties relating to total star formation reflects a range of localized conditions in the molecular clouds .",
    "the possible dependence of @xmath8 on fir / sub - mm surface brightness ( see fig .",
    "[ r2sb ] ) and @xmath63 ( see fig .  [ r2sfe ] ) suggests that the higher degree of co excitation is related to a higher concentration and efficiency of star forming activity .",
    "such conditions would arise in an intense starburst where the surface density of such activity is high , consuming most of the gas in the region .",
    "the saturation effect of @xmath8 seen at higher @xmath63 which is probably due to thermalization of the co levels , reflecting denser and warmer gas in regions of high star formation efficiency .",
    "this interpretation is consistent also with the non - linear relation between @xmath9 and @xmath3 ( see fig .  [ lco2lfir ] ) , and with higher color temperatures associated with the most ir luminous and most efficient star forming galaxies .",
    "it is not clear whether these correlations reflect a high excitation ratio as the underlying cause or the effect of star forming activity .",
    "the regime where @xmath8 @xmath4 1.0 requires optically thin co lines from extremely warm and/or dense gas .",
    "the relatively small number of galaxies with high values of @xmath8 might be associated with the highly excited gas from a short - lived gas phase in the starburst systems .",
    "the lower line ratios may be associated with gas that is cooler and less denser .",
    "the investigation of the gas and dust content depends critically on a reliable estimate of the controversial parameter @xmath13 .",
    "studies have shown that this parameter varies from galaxy to galaxy @xcite , and it is thought to be higher in metal - poor galaxies and lower in starburst galaxies than in galactic molecular clouds , where @xmath13 is about 2.8 @xmath23 10@xmath76 cm@xmath16 [ k km s@xmath21]@xmath21 @xcite .",
    "thus in starburst galaxies , application of the standard factor can produce a significant overestimate of molecular hydrogen mass @xcite .      in this section ,",
    "we examine the molecular gas content and properties using large velocity gradient ( lvg ) models .",
    "the lvg method is capable in principle of yielding the column density of co , and hence of h@xmath12 , if an abundance ratio @xmath14 = [ co / h@xmath12 ] is assumed .",
    "hence , this method should yield an estimate of the @xmath13 factor independent of other considerations such as gas - to - dust ratio , which is discussed in the next section .",
    "we assume that the ism comprises molecular clouds characterized by a single set of average physical properties .",
    "it is well understood that models incorporating more data for starburst galaxies require at least two components - a prevailing optically thin warm diffuse component , and an optically thick cool dense component with a smaller filling factor ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , comparisons between single and double component models yield approximately the same column density for h@xmath12 , which is weighted strongly toward the prevailing diffuse component ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the lvg approach can be formulated into an equation yielding the @xmath13 factor from the lvg parameters given by    @xmath78    where @xmath79(h@xmath80 is the h@xmath12 gas density , @xmath81 is the radiation temperature for the @xmath0co(1 - 0 ) line transition , @xmath82 = @xmath83 , and @xmath84 is the velocity gradient associated with the individual clouds ( see appendix a ) .",
    "there are not enough data to uniquely determine the parameters in this equation , which usually require multiple line excitation ratios , measured brightness temperatures , and isotope intensity ratios to fully constrain the conditions in the molecular gas . in our case",
    ", it is therefore necessary to make some reasonable assumptions to constrain the lvg solutions .",
    "the highest degree of uncertainty concerns the parameter @xmath14 which is unknown and needs to be addressed .",
    "values widely quoted for starburst galaxies are in the range 10@xmath85 - 10@xmath15 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , there are few if any reliable determinations for starburst galaxies . within the milky way , measurements of @xmath14 and chemical models for dark and star forming clouds yield values within the range 5 @xmath23 10@xmath85 - 2.7 @xmath23 10@xmath15 @xcite .",
    "it seems unlikely therefore that @xmath14 @xmath86 10@xmath85 for starburst galaxies unless their metallicity is unusually low , which would occur only in low luminosity systems . for the slugs sample , therefore , we adopt @xmath14 = 10@xmath15 , bearing in mind the dependence of our computed values for @xmath13 on this parameter .",

    "thus for each galaxy in one of the data plots , it is possible to derive a molecular gas density and radiation temperature @xmath81 which is dependent upon @xmath82 . using equation ( 5 ) , we then compute a range of @xmath13 parameter for the ir luminous galaxies . for each @xmath82 ,",

    "however , the latter value of @xmath82 is virtually unacceptable , since it corresponds to an impossibly high velocity gradient or impossibly low co abundance .",
