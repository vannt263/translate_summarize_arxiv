    "phenomenological supersymmetry allows to incorporate the perturbative standard model in a theory which solves the hierarchy problem all the way up to the planck scale , with a potentially successful description of gauge coupling unification . the consistency with the electroweak precision tests ( ewpt ) of the standard model ( sm ) with a relatively light higgs boson adds support to this view , making the test of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) a crucial task of the lhc",
    "this is a meaningful straight path to be followed for particle physics in the next few years . while remaining in the context of phenomenological supersymmetry , however , the lack of signals so far both in the higgs and in the flavour sectors have raised and continue to raise questions .    that the higgs problem of the mssm be a naturalness problem is too well known to be recalled here in detail : the sensitivity of the fermi scale , as determined by the higgs potential of the mssm , to the average stop masses makes it unnatural to raise the mass of the lightest scalar , @xmath2 , much above the tree level bound , @xmath3 , in potential conflict with the lep bounds .",
    "is the flavour problem a naturalness problem as well ? given the little we understand about flavour , this is not the easiest question to answer .",
    "let us take the view , however , as put forward by many authors in the nineties @xcite - @xcite , that the supersymmetric flavour problem may have something to do with a hierarchical structure of s - fermion masses : the first two generations significantly heavier than the third one .",
    "how much heavier can now become a naturalness problem , depending on the bounds that the sfermion masses have to satisfy @xcite@xcite . here",
    "we argue about the possibility that the two issues ,  the higgs problem \" and  the flavour problem \" , be related naturalness problems , that may be addressed at the same time by properly extending the mssm .",
    "let us insist on the supersymmetric flavour problem in connection with a hierarchical s - fermion spectrum .",
    "as well known , without degeneracy nor alignment between the first two generations of squarks , @xmath4 , the consistency with the @xmath5 transitions , both real and especially imaginary , would require values of @xmath4 far too big to be natural .",
    "relatively mild assumptions on all the s - fermion masses of the first two generations , on the other hand , as recalled later , allow to satisfy the various flavour constraints by smaller values of @xmath6 that may be considered if they are natural or not , hence the potential connection with the higgs mass problem .",
    "in formulae , the two naturalness constraints ( @xmath7 is the amount of fine tuning as defined in the usual way @xcite , @xmath8 is the average stop mass ) : @xmath9 @xmath10 must be considered together and the corresponding bounds might be reduced to an acceptable level by pushing up the theoretical value of @xmath11 , on which the level of fine tuning depends at least quadratically with the @xmath12 mass or with any of the soft mass parameters for the higgs doublets does not change the naturalness constraints on @xmath8 or on @xmath6 , at least as long as the other physical higgs bosons are not too close in mass to the lightest one , @xmath2 , as we consider in the following for good phenomenological reasons . on this , see e.g. @xcite . ] . ways to push up @xmath11 even by a significant amount , between 200 and 300 gev , have already been put forward @xcite - @xcite . whether and how the flavour problem can also be attacked in this manner is a model dependent question that we are going to analyze in various cases proposed in the literature . in summary , and as an anticipation , we seek for models where a typical spectrum like the one shown in fig .",
    "[ spettro2 ] can be naturally implemented .",
    "gev and @xmath13 tev.,width=377 ]",
    "a way to summarize the potential connection between the supersymmetric flavour problem and hierarchical s - fermion masses is the following or viceversa . ] .    * without degeneracy nor alignment the bounds that the first two generations of squark masses would have to satisfy to be compatible with the flavour constraints , mostly from @xmath14 transitions , are in the hundreds of tev , with weak dependence on the much lighter gaugino masses . on the other hand ,",
    "if we assume degeneracy and alignment of order of the cabibbo angle , i.e. in terms of the standard notation : @xmath15 and @xmath16 , then the bounds are significantly reduced to : @xmath17 @xmath18 furthermore if @xmath19 ( or @xmath20 ) , these bounds are replaced in the strongest cases by : @xmath21 @xmath22 from cp conserving or cp violating effects respectively .",
    "* the exchange of the third generation of s - fermions may also produce too big flavour effects unless the off - diagonal @xmath23 are small enough .",
    "if for example we assume a correlation between the off - diagonal elements and the ratio of the diagonal masses of the type : @xmath24 a dominant constraint comes from @xmath25 mixing : @xmath26    similar or weaker constraints are obtained from the electric dipole moments .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the way in which the lsp in the mssm can acquire the observed relic abundance to allow its interpretation as a dm candidate is well known . as observed in @xcite ,",
    "after lep constraints are taken into account , the correct prediction for the dm density requires special relations among parameters , justifying the terminology of  well - tempered \" neutralino .",
    "this is neatly illustrated in fig .",
    "[ dm1 - 2 ] on the left hand side , which is appropriate to the  well - tempered \" bino / higgsino case , i.e. for large ( and irrelevant ) @xmath27 : to obtain the observed relic abundance , @xmath28 and @xmath29 should be pretty close to each other . in the same plot , which is for @xmath30 gev and @xmath31 , the regions are also shown to which the direct detection searches are either currently sensitive @xcite or should become sensitive in a near future @xcite . to draw these contours",
    "we assume everywhere a standard dm density in the halo of our galaxy .",
    "these sensitivity regions are therefore directly relevant only where they overlap with regions of correct relic abundance .",
    "the effect of the larger @xmath11 is clearly visible in the same fig .",
    "[ dm1 - 2 ] on the right hand side , which is appropriate to @xmath32susy for @xmath33 gev and @xmath34 , while @xmath27 is still kept large . in both plots of fig .",
    "[ dm1 - 2 ] it is @xmath35 gev . the effect of the @xmath36 threshold , only visible in the figure on the right , is due to the @xmath37 behaviour of the @xmath38 coupling , negligible in the case of the mssm for @xmath39 .    fig .",
    "[ dm3 - 4 ] shows two other cases for @xmath32susy . on the left hand side",
    "everything is as in fig .",
    "[ dm1 - 2 ] right , except for @xmath40 gev . on the right hand side , for @xmath41 gev and @xmath34 , @xmath27 is lowered to 200 gev .",
    "the raise of @xmath11 has also a clear and well known effect on the direct detection cross sections , dominated by @xmath2-exchange and therefore proportional to @xmath42 @xcite@xcite .",
    "this effect is relatively compensated in the low @xmath27 case by a significant change in the lsp composition .",
    "can it be that the higgs mass problem and the flavour problem contain a unique message ?",
    "this is the question we have addressed in this work . notwithstanding",
    "the validity of the standard mssm approach , which makes its test a crucial task of the lhc , we believe that this is a meaningful question .",
    "truly enough it rests on the notion of naturalness , which can hardly be viewed as the basis of any theorem .",
    "the lack of any serious understanding of the flavour pattern is another difficulty we face .",
    "yet the possibility that the higgs mass problem and the flavour problem point to an extension of the mssm needs to be given serious consideration .",
    "the basic simple idea that we pursue is that a lightest higgs boson naturally heavier than in the mssm renders at the same time more plausible that the supersymmetric flavour problem has something to do with a hierarchical structure of the s - fermion masses , a connection often invoked in the past .    at first the constraints set by",
    "the lack of flavour signals would seem to require values of the masses of the first two generations totally incompatible with naturalness .",
    "however the combination of mild flavour assumptions with a relaxation of the naturalness constraints by an order of magnitude thorough a heavier higgs boson than normal can change the situation . the concrete proposal that we make , which should at least be taken as an example ,",
    "consists of the following .",
    "with degeneracy and alignment between the first two generations of s - fermions controlled by a parameter of the order of the cabibbo angle and a ratio of @xmath43 between @xmath44 and @xmath45 , in one direction or another , even the hardest flavour constraints can be satisfied by @xmath46 tev . in turn",
    "these masses are natural if they are born degenerate , at least within @xmath47 multiplets , at a scale @xmath48 below @xmath49 tev and a modification of the higgs sector , which remains perturbative up to the same scale , raises the lighest higgs boson mass in the @xmath50 gev range , e.g. like in @xmath32susy . no matter what produces it , a non standard supersymmetric spectrum like the one shown in fig .",
    "[ spettro2 ] is brought into focus .    even before any detailed investigation , which we believe is well worth doing ,",
    "the following phenomenological consequences clearly emerge :    * the abundance of top , even generally more than bottom quarks , in the gluino decays , giving rise to a distinctive signature in gluino pair production , which could be detected already in the early stages of the lhc . * the appearance of the very much non mssm - like golden mode decay of the lighest higgs boson , @xmath51 , although with a reduced branching ratio @xcite@xcite relative to the sm one with the same higgs boson mass . * a distinctive distortion of the relic abundance of the lightest neutralino , again relative to the mssm , due to the @xmath52-channel exchange of the heavier higgs boson in the lsp annihilation cross section , with an lsp which needs no longer be  well - tempered \" .",
    "several other phenomenological features , more or less tied to @xmath32susy , are present , which may be useful to study carefully .",
