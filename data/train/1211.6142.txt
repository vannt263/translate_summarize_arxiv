    "the high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) are relatively young ( @xmath1 year ) galactic sources composed of a massive ob or be type star and a compact object , either a neutron star or a black hole .",
    "these systems are bright x - rays emitters , generally ( but not always ) due to matter from the massive star accreting onto the compact object .    in the last decade a handful of hmxbs have been detected at high ( he ; 0.1100 gev ) or very high - energies ( vhe ; @xmath2100 gev ) .",
    "they are ls",

    "recently a new source has been claimed to belong to this class of sources .",
    "it is hess j0632 + 057 . in this proceeding",
    "we summarize the path covered from the discovery of hess j0632 + 057  as unidentified source , to the claiming of its binarity .",
    "finally , we describe the deep search for its emission in the gev energy range , and we discuss the analogies and the differences that this particular source shows with respects the others @xmath0-ray hmxbs .",
    "hess j0632 + 057 was discovered at vhe energies by the high energy spectroscopic system ( h.e.s.s . ) on 2007 @xcite .",
    "it is in the monoceros loop region , very close to the rosette nebulae .",
    "it was classified as a point - like unidentified source .",
    "it is interesting to note that all the vhe galactic sources are extended , with the exception of the hmxbs .",
    "therefore , the point - like feature of hess j0632 + 057 was a strong indication of its binary nature .",
    "further more , of many tens of unidentified sources discovered in the galactic plane h.e.s.s .",
    "survey , hess j0632 + 057 is one of the only two unidentified vhe sources which appears to be point - like within the experimental resolution of the instrument .",
    "the other ( hess j1745 - 290 ) is coincident with the gravitational center of the milky way @xcite . when hess j0632 + 057 was discovered , several plausible association with sources in other wave - lengths were discussed .",
    "a posteriori , the most relevant was the association with a massive emission - line star of spectral type b0pe ( mwc 148 , see section [ optradio ] ) .",
    "the flux and the spectral index of this source measured by h.e.s.s .",
    "are @xmath5 @xmath6 s@xmath7 , @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "subsiquently to the discovery , veritas and magic started to monitor hess j0632 + 057 .",
    "it was observed by veritas for 31 hr in 2006 , 2008 , and 2009 .",
    "the first observation was pointed toward the center of the monoceros region , ( at an angular distance of @xmath9 from the hess j0632 + 057 ) .",
    "the other observations were targeted around the reported position of hess j0632 + 057 . during these observations , no significant signal in at energies above 1 tev was detected , and a flux upper limit of @xmath10 @xmath6 s@xmath7 at 99% confidence level @xcite .",
    "the non detection by veritas during these observations provides variability in the vhe flux of hess j0632 + 057 .",
    "this was in favor with the binary interpretation of this source .",
    "afterwards , the source was detected by magic and veritas in february 2011 , when tev observation were triggered by an outburst in x - rays @xcite .",
    "the spectrum measured by magic is compatible with the one measured by h.e.s.s .",
    "further observations with veritas have been performed until february 2012 @xcite . in the right panel of figure [ foldedlc ]",
    "are plotted the integral @xmath0-ray fluxes above 1 tev of hess j0632 + 057 measured by veritas in the different observations .",
    "since its discovery , hess j0632 + 057 was followed by several x - ray observatories . as first , an observation taken on the 2007 september 17 with the epic camera of _ xmm - newton _ lead to the detection of a new x - ray source ( xmmu j063259.3 + 054801 ) within the error box of hess j0632 + 057 , and coincident with the massive star mwc 148 .",
    "this source exhibits a hard spectrum , consistent with an absorbed power law with @xmath11 , and the unabsorbed @xmath12 kev flux is @xmath13 erg @xmath6 s@xmath7 .",
    "a long monitoring of this source was planned with the _ swift _ x - ray telescope .",
    "a first set of data covering 108 days was analyzed by @xcite .",
    "they measured flux increases by a factor @xmath14 , and found that x - ray variability was present on multiple timescales including days to months .",
    "the x - ray outburst on february 2011 that was announced by @xcite triggered the observation of veritas and magic ( see section [ discovery ] ) , as well as an observation with _ chandra _ requested by @xcite . comparing the results of the chandra data analysis with those of the first observation of _ xmm - newton _ @xcite found also a a spectral variability in addition to the flux one .",
    "indeed , the spectral index measured was @xmath15 .",
    "the flux and spectral variability are both characteristic features of the hmxbs , but in contrast with what observed for the other tev binaries , in this source the higher the flux the softer the x - ray spectrum .",
    "finally , the detection of the orbital periodicity of @xmath16 days was claimed by @xcite .",
    "the periodical x - ray flux modulation was the result of the analysis of the long set of _ swift _ observations of the source from 2009 january to 2011 march . in figure [ foldedlc ] ( left plot )",
    "is shown the folded x - ray light curve of hess j0632 + 057 .",
    "it shows a narrow high peak at phase 0.3 followed by a dip feature , and centered at phase 0.75 there is a moderate broad peak .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ observation fall in the dip feature , where the spectrum is harder , while the chandra observation was taken during the high peak .",
    "phase 0.0 in this plot is arbitrary set at the beginning of the _ swift _ observations .",
    "mwc 148 is the companion massive star in the binary system hess j0632 + 056 .",
    "it is a be star , as in the case of the hmxb systems ls  i  + 61@xmath3303 , and psr b1259 - 63 . before the detection of the orbital period in x - rays",
    ", @xcite analyzed optical spectra of the star acquired to investigate the stellar parameters , the properties of the be star disk , and evidence of the binarity .",
    "they derived a mass of 13.2 - 19.0 @xmath17 , and a radius of 6.0 - 9.0 @xmath18 . fitting the spectral energy distribution they found a distance between 1.1 and 1.7 kpc .",
    "since their dataset was too short ( @xmath19 month ) it was not possible to detect the orbital period of the system .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite collected optical spectra observations spanning for 4 years from 2008 october to 2011 may .",
    "they calculated the orbital parameters of the binary systems , finding that it is highly eccentric with @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , the orbital solution implies that the high peak in the x - ray light curve is delayed @xmath21 orbital phases after the periastron passage , similar to the case of ls  i  + 61@xmath3303 .    in the radio regime",
    "@xcite detected with the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) and the very large array ( vla ) observations at 1.28 and 5ghz , respectively , a point - like , variable radio source at the position of mcw 148 .",

    "the source appears point - like , whereas in the second one it appears extended with a projected size of @xmath2275au assuming a distance to the system of 1.5kpc .",
    "the brightness temperature of 2@xmath2310@xmath24k at 1.6ghz together with the negative spectral index around point to non - thermal synchrotron radiation producing the radio emission @xcite .",
    "the detected projected displacement of the peak of the emission of 21au in 30 days , the morphology and the size of hess j0632 + 057  are similar to the ones observed in the well - established @xmath0-ray binaries psr b1259@xmath463 , ls5039 , ls  i  + 61@xmath3303 .",
    "all the @xmath0-ray hmxbs have a bright emission in the gev energy range , but hess j0632 + 057  is not present in the second _ fermi_-lat source catalog @xcite ( 2fgl hereafter ) .",

    "the regioin around hess j0632 + 057  appears quite crowded , and not perfectly modeled by the 2fgl sources .",

    "_ fermi_-lat data has been analyzed with the aim to search for the emission in the gev energy range of hess j0632 + 057 .",
    "the analysis performed needed particular attention especially for the presence of a very nearby @xmath0-ray pulsar psr j0633 + 0632 ( section 5.1 ) .",
    "as first , we selected the events out of the peaks of the pulsars .",
    "then , the region around the source was modeled adding new point - like sources in correspondence of unmodeled excesses with an iterative method . despite the good modeling of the region , we did not detected any significant signal of @xmath0-ray emission from hess j0632 + 057 .",
    "we calculated the upper limit for its permanent gev emission , @xmath34 @xmath6 s@xmath7 .",

    "the lack of significant signal from all these searches is difficult to understand if compared with the behavior of the other @xmath0-ray hmxbs in the same energy range .",
    "similar to hess j0632 + 057 , the massive stars in ls  i  + 61@xmath3303  and psr b1259 - 63 systems are be star , that are characterized by the presence of a dense circumstellar disk .",

    "the systems is also the most compact among the three . in the gev energy range ,",
    "ls  i  + 61@xmath3303  has a continuous emission modulated by its orbital motion . most probably the gev emission is present in every phase of the orbit because it is so small that the compact object is always interacting with the circumstellar disk , or with the stellar wind .",
    "a different case is that of psr b1259 - 63 with its very large orbital period of about 3.5 years .",
    "the orbit of this system is highly eccentric , with eccentricity @xmath38 .",
    "this makes that when the compact object is close to the periastron , it pass through the circumstellar disk . only during this passage psr b1259 - 63 emits gev and tev @xmath0-rays .",
    "hess j0632 + 057  has an orbital period of about 1 year , that is in between those of ls  i  + 61@xmath3303  and psr b1259 + 63 .",
    "the eccentricity of the orbit of hess j0632 + 057  is also very high , with @xmath39 .",
    "we expected a gev emission at least during the periastron passage , but we did not detected it .",
    "this can be attributed to different factors .",
    "an important role can be played by the features of the circumstellar disk , like its size , its density , and its inclination respect to both the observer line of sight and the plane of the orbit . on the other hand ,",
    "the differences among ls  i  + 61@xmath3303 psr b1259 + 63 , and hess j0632 + 057 , can also be attributed to the features of the compact objects , like the intensity of their relativistic winds .",
    "or they could be caused by the different nature of the compact object itself , either a pulsars ( as for psr b1259 + 63 ) or a black hole .",
    "all these hypothesis are currently under investigation .",
