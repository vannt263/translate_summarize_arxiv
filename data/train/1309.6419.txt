    "cognitive computing with nanoelectronics is an emerging field of research that aims to fill the gap between cpus performance and mammalian brains .",
    "cpus outperform human brain in almost all tasks that involve deterministic computation .",
    "they , however , lack a very important feature , which is the ability to learn and work with unreliable building blocks .",
    "this unique characteristic of mammalian brains has attracted attention of scientists from different fields including electronic engineering . in the late 1980s ,",
    "caver mead , and later eric vittoz , envisioned the use of very - large - scale integration ( vlsi ) systems to mimic neuro - biological architectures of nervous system @xcite .",
    "it is believed that the hippocampus of a mammalian brain is responsible for memory and learning .",
    "it consists of neurons and chemical synapses @xcite . on the contrary to the common belief that neural systems , including hippocampus , are analog systems , there are several neurobiological evidence for existence of discrete changes of synaptic strength at least in some subfields in hippocampus @xcite .",
    "there are also a number of research that suggest efficient learning with digital synapses @xcite .",
    "therefore , even though an analog approach promises more power efficiency , a digital implementation improves design simplicity , it does not have limited scalability of analog implementations , it is less costly , small , and by far more integrable , hence , practically the best way , if not the only way , to implement highly scalable neuromorphic systems @xcite .",
    "for instance , analog designs allow low - voltage operation , which then requires larger sensing circuitry and also does not necessarily support reasonable throughputs ( spikes / s ) .",
    "it is expected that massively parallel , reliable , scalable , and potentially energy efficient cognitive systems could be implemented using 1-bit stochastic synapses .",
    "a deterministic approach , has its focus on  more number of bits per synapse to allow a more precise implementation of a learning rule , and generally suffers multiple data conversion ( adcs and dacs ) . on the other side ,",
    "emerging artificial synapses , such as rram ( resitive ram ) , cbram ( conductive bridge ram ) , pcm ( phase change memory ) and atomic switches , in their analog operating mode , have issues like ( i ) complicated programming pulse - schemes to achieve more intermediate states , which sometimes only exists in one switching direction ( either off - on or on - off ) , and ( ii ) the problem of resistance drift or state retention @xcite . technologies like stt - mram ( spin - transfer torque magnetoresistive ram ) and meram ( magnetoelectric ram ) also show existence of multi - stable states , but their low signal - to - noise ( snr ) properties @xcite suggests them impractical for conventional analog neuromorphic computing .",
    "a workaround to these problems is to make the artificial synaptic transmission a probabilistic process , which can be achieved either in - situ ( randomness within the device ) or ex - situ ( external random number generator ) @xcite .",
    "this work uses the in - situ stochastic switching characteristic of rram devices to present a technology independent approach to implement a highly scalable neuromorphic hardware that is capable of emulating sensitivity of synaptic potentials in neurons of primary visual cortex to the orientation of a visual image .",
    "considering the underlying physical mechanisms of binary switching in rram , cbram and pcm it can be envisioned that their yield - loss and variation remain substantially larger than their cmos counterparts .",
    "therefore , a probabilistic approach is one of the most practical and highly scalable designs for neuromorphic hardware and logic operations with nanoelectronics .",
    "stochastic binary switching is common between the emerging memory technologies .",
    "this behavior normally occurs under certain condition , which is called `` weak '' programming .",
    "although , the weak programming condition is different across technologies , a technology independent approach is presented to pave the way for further unification of system - level behavior based on above mentioned technologies .",
    "stochastic switching of a nanodevice could be treated as a black - box ; a generalized model , which is identified by a set of inputs and outputs .",
    "[ fig : func ] provides an overview of the model .",
    "outputs @xmath0 and @xmath1 represent next state and next conductance of the device , which both are probabilistic and their values are defined by the functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively . once @xmath0 is determined , @xmath1 is calculated using an experimentally verified distribution ( in this paper , log - normal ) of on and off state resistances .",
    "the function @xmath2 is a function of voltage / current , time ( here pulse - width ) and operating temperature .",
    "small updates in @xmath3 is independent of function @xmath2 output , which means if @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath1 may not be equal .",

    "are considered to have an overall impact on the switching probability , therefore , their impact are not discussed as independent variables .",
    "[ fig_swprob ] demonstrates switching probability of the set ( s@xmath20s@xmath21 ) and reset ( s@xmath22s@xmath23 ) . under similar condition ,",
    "a set is more likely than a reset . given that the s@xmath20s@xmath21 seems more likely , it is possible to modulate the probabilistic ltp using a complicated learning rule , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 represents synaptic weight that is bounded between a maximum and a minimum limits , through a different programming pulse - scheme for ltp , which makes the design more complex .",
    "experimentally verified information rgarding the switching probability model are given in @xcite .",
    "the switching probability is achieved by integrating a poisson - like distribution , which is in an excellent agreement with the hypothesis of thermodynamic activation during filament formation over a dominant energy barrier in rram devices .    .",
    "( a ) demonstrates set switching probability and ( b ) shows reset switching probability .",
    "@xmath26 represents applied voltage pulse - width.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    the mentioned experimental studies suggest that the switching probability of redox - based memory is a cumulative phenomenon , which links the digital and analog characteristic of the device",
    ". the probabilistic set and reset , under such circumstance , can therefore be shown as a function of number of applied pulses with a given amplitude - time combination to model the history dependent effects .",
    "one could argue that such spike - history - dependent - plasticity provides further phenomenological similarities between these artificial synapses and the chemical synapses , where history dependent effects also play an important role @xcite .",
    "this stochastic behavior in combination with @xmath24 results a probabilistic ltp ( long - term potentiation ) and ltd ( long - term depression ) , which is a function of time difference ( @xmath19 ) between a pre- and a post - synaptic spike ( probabilistic spike timing - dependent plasticity , pstdp ) or their difference in voltage ( @xmath18 ) .",
