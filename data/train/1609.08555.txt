    "<S> equilibrium magnetization states in thin spherical shells of a magnetically soft ferromagnet are determined by the competition between two interactions : ( i ) the local exchange interaction favors the more homogeneous onion state with magnetization oriented in meridian directions ; such a state is realized in relatively small particles . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) the nonlocal magnetostatic interaction prefers the double - vortex configuration with the magnetization oriented in the parallels directions , since it minimizes the volume magnetostatic charges . </S>",
    "<S> these states are topologically equivalent , in contrast to the same - name states of magnetic nanoring . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> a continuous ( the second order ) phase transition between the vortex and onion states takes place . the detailed analytical description of the phase diagram is well confirmed by micromagnetic simulations .    </S>",
