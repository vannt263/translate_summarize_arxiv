    "the function @xmath43 thus measures the radiation pattern seen by an observer far from an interaction region ; in the case of static metrics , it is known to be an explicit realization of the lax - phillips translation representation as well as a geometric generalization of the radon transform @xcite .",

    "we also remark that the power of @xmath39 in the second formula differs from the previous one by @xmath50 due to a derivative in the definition of the radiation field .    in minkowski space ,",
    "the requirement that @xmath18 vanish in a neighborhood of @xmath20 implies that @xmath18 is the _ forward _ solution of @xmath51 .",
    "one should then think of the vanishing requirement as analogous to taking the forward solution of @xmath52 .    in minkowski - like settings , namely when the forward and backward problems are well - posed in the sense that given an element @xmath21 of @xmath22 supported away from @xmath53 there are unique tempered @xmath54 , resp .",

    "@xmath58 , one can turn the solution of the cauchy problem for appropriate space - like hypersurfaces transversal to @xmath14 ( and intersecting @xmath8 in @xmath14 only ) with schwartz initial data into the sum of a `` forward solution '' to which our theorem applies ( supported away from @xmath57 ) , and a similar `` backward solution '' ( supported away from @xmath58 ) , to which the analogue of our theorem ( interchanging @xmath12 with @xmath13 ) applies .",
    "thus , in particular , the asymptotic behavior of solutions of the cauchy problem with schwartz initial data is given by our theorem .",
    "a statement related to , but slightly weaker than , this forward and backward well - posedness follows from our assumptions ( see remark  [ remark : solvability ] ) , but improving on this , possibly under some additional hypotheses , requires addressing issues beyond the scope of our paper , and thus will be taken up elsewhere .",
    "it follows from our arguments that the expansion depends continuously on @xmath18 and @xmath21 satisfying a fixed support condition ( support in a fixed compact set disjoint from @xmath57 ) in the tempered , respectively @xmath22 , topologies . in particular , finite expansions",
    "follow from imposing finite regularity assumptions , but we do not attempt to make optimal statements in this paper regarding the required regularity assumptions .",
    "a question of considerable interest is , of course , whether the radiation field actually _ decays _ as @xmath59 and , more generally , the description of the exponents @xmath60 remarkably , these are the resonance poles of a naturally - defined asymptotically hyperbolic metric defined on @xmath61 ( more precisely , the poles we are interested in are those of the inverses of a family of operators that looks to leading order like an asymptotically hyperbolic laplacian .",
    "it is not in general a _",
    "spectral family _ of the form @xmath62 however : the @xmath63-dependence is more complex . )",
    "we denote the family of asymptotically hyperbolic operators by @xmath64 and record the following corollary :    if there exists @xmath65 such that @xmath66 has no poles at @xmath63 with @xmath67 then for all @xmath68 , the radiation field decays at a rate @xmath69 .",
    "one class of spacetimes to which our theorem ( and corollary ) applies is that of _ normally short - range _ perturbations of minkowski space , i.e. , perturbations of the metric which are , relative to the original metric , @xmath70 in the normal - to - the boundary component , @xmath71 , @xmath72 in the tangential - to - the - boundary components , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and @xmath76 in the mixed components . in particular , note that we are permitted make _ large _ perturbations of the spherical metric on the cap @xmath77 hence in these `` tangential '' metric components our hypotheses allow a much wider range of geometries than even traditional `` long - range '' perturbations of minkowski space .",
    "we note here that the long - range structure of the schwarzschild and kerr spacetimes near null infinity does not fit into our class of spacetimes .",
    "such spacetimes will be addressed in the follow - up to this paper . also left to a future paper is the question of how to integrate the decay estimates for geometries with mild ( e.g. , normally hyperbolic ) trapping into our analysis .    in the more restrictive setting of",
    "_ `` normally very short range '' _ perturbations ( defined at the beginning of section  [ sec : minkowski - space-1 ] ) , we recover the same asymptotically hyperbolic problem at infinity as in the minkowski case , and therefore exhibit the same order decay as seen on minkowski space .",
    "in particular , in odd spatial dimensions one has rapid decay of solutions of the wave equation away from the light cone .",
    "thus , we obtain the following corollary for `` normally very short range '' perturbations of minkowski space :    [ cor : very - short - range ] if @xmath45 is a normally very short range non - trapping perturbation of @xmath0-dimensional minkowski space , @xmath18 vanishes near @xmath20 , and @xmath78 , then the radiation field of @xmath18 has an asymptotic expansion of the following form : @xmath42(s,\\omega ) \\sim      \\begin{cases }        o(s^{-\\infty } ) & n \\text { even } \\\\        \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty}\\sum _ { \\kappa\\leq j } s^{-\\frac{n}{2}-j}(\\log        s)^{\\kappa } a_{j\\kappa } & n\\text { odd }      \\end{cases}\\ ] ] more generally in the case of normally short - range perturbations , given @xmath79 if the @xmath72 metric perturbations of the tangential - to - the - boundary metric components are sufficiently small then the radiation field still decays as @xmath59 : @xmath42(s,\\omega ) \\lesssim s^{\\alpha+{{\\epsilon}}},\\quad \\alpha=-\\min(2,n/2).\\ ] ]    the polynomial decay of solutions of the wave equation may be compared with the klainerman ",

    "further , the resonances of the asymptotically hyperbolic problem depend continuously on perturbations in an appropriate sense .",
    "the operator @xmath86 introduced below is stable , but may contain additional poles at certain pure imaginary integers as compared to the asymptotically hyperbolic problem ( as is the case in even dimensional minkowski space ) .",
    "although such poles do not contribute to the asymptotics of the radiation field , under perturbations they may become poles of @xmath87 .",
    "thus , for _ small _ normally short range perturbations of minkowski space , @xmath81 is close to @xmath88 ( rather than @xmath89 ) .",
    "( in higher dimensions , one may improve this statement to obtain @xmath81 close to @xmath90 by a careful analysis of resonant states supported exactly at the light cone . as the most interesting case is @xmath91 , when @xmath92 , we do not pursue this improvement here . )",
    "the class of spacetimes we consider is geometrically more general than the class of spacetimes on with the klainerman ",
    "sobolev estimates hold , but we require a complete asymptotic expansion of the metric ( and thus considerably more smoothness at infinity ) .",
    "the methods we employ would , however , allow also for finite expansions when the metric has a finite expansion , using more careful accounting .",
    "finally , we note that a remarkable extension of the radiation field construction has been obtained by wang @xcite to the nonlinear setting of the einstein vacuum equations on perturbations of minkowski space in spacetimes of dimension @xmath93 and higher .",
    "this is based in part on very strong estimates of melrose - wang @xcite in the linear setting for the special case of asymptotically minkowski metrics .",
    "we start with a tempered solution @xmath18 of @xmath94 vanishing identically in a neighborhood of @xmath20 .",
    "we then fix @xmath95 supported near @xmath96 so that @xmath97 is identically @xmath98 near @xmath20 , identically @xmath50 near the portion of the boundary where @xmath18 is non - vanishing .",
    "in particular , the support of @xmath99 is compact in @xmath100 and @xmath101 near @xmath96 .",
    "we then consider the function @xmath102 and set @xmath103 the function @xmath104 then solves @xmath105 for some other function @xmath106 vanishing near @xmath20 .",
    "a propagation of singularities argument ( section  [ sec : b - regularity ] ) shows that @xmath104 is conormal to @xmath107 .",
    "we now set @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the reduced normal operator , i.e. , the family of operators on the boundary at infinity obtained by mellin transform in the normal variable @xmath110 if we set @xmath111 , @xmath112 to be the mellin transforms of @xmath104 , and @xmath21 , respectively , then @xmath111 solves @xmath113 where the additional correction terms arise because @xmath114 is not assumed to be dilation - invariant .",
    "we show that the operator @xmath115 fits into the framework of vasy  @xcite and modify the argument of that paper to show that @xmath115 is invertible on certain variable - order sobolev spaces ( section  [ sec : results - citevasy ] ) .",
    "the argument further shows that @xmath86 is a meromorphic family of fredholm operators with finitely many poles in each horizontal strip .",
    "in fact , the poles of @xmath86 may be identified with resonances for an asymptotically hyperbolic problem ( section  [ sec : ident - p_sigma-1 ] ) .",
    "an argument of haber ",
    "vasy  @xcite implies that the residues at the poles of @xmath86 are @xmath116-based conormal distributions . in sections  [ sec : conormal - reg ] and [ sec : logs ]",
    "we show that they are in fact classical conormal distributions and thus have an expansion in terms of @xmath33 .",
    "we calculate the leading terms of the expansion somewhat explicitly . inverting the mellin transform and iteratively shifting the contour of integration in the mellin inversion ( section  [ sec : an - asympt - expans ] ) realizes these residues as the coefficients of an asymptotic expansion for @xmath104 in terms of @xmath32 .",
    "a slight complication is that not only do the terms of the expansion become more singular as distributions on @xmath8 as one obtains more decay ( as is indeed necessary for them to contribute to the radiation field in the same way , i.e. , letting @xmath117 with @xmath37 fixed ) , but the remainder term also becomes more singular .",
    "we use the a priori conormal regularity , as shown in section  [ sec : b - regularity ] , to deal with this issue .",
    "the philosophy here is that since the algebra of b - pseudodifferential operators , discussed in section  [ sec : b - geometry - mellin ] with further references given there , is not commutative to leading order in the sense of decay at @xmath8 ( unlike , say , melrose s scattering pseudodifferential algebra ) , one first should obtain regularity in the differential sense , which is the conormal regularity of section  [ sec : b - regularity ] , and then proceed to obtain decay estimates .    finally , rewriting the expansion in terms of the radiation field blow - up @xmath118 yields an asymptotic expansion at all boundary hypersurfaces .",
    "the explicit computation of the leading terms shows that the logarithmic terms match up and thus @xmath104 may be restricted to the front face of the blow - up , yielding the radiation field ( after differentiation ) , and proving theorem  [ thm : main - theorem ] in section  [ sec : asympt - radi - field ] .",
    "for a more thorough discussion of b - pseudodifferential operators and b - geometry , we refer the reader to chapter 4 of melrose  @xcite .",
    "_ in this section and the following , we initially take @xmath2 to be a manifold with boundary with coordinates @xmath119 yielding a product decomposition @xmath120 of a collar neighborhood of @xmath121 in particular , for now we lump the @xmath33 variable in with the other boundary variables as it will not play a distinguished role .",

    "we note that @xmath125 is well - defined , independent of choices of coordinates , modulo @xmath127 ; one may call this the _ b - normal vector field _ to the boundary .",

    "we can transfer these operators to manifolds @xmath5 via localization and adding @xmath23 schwartz kernels to the space ; here we may assume that @xmath5 is compact .",

    "further , if @xmath1534 and @xmath623 is order @xmath39 then @xmath1535 is continuous ; taking @xmath1536 elliptic of order @xmath39 , then this is equivalent to @xmath1537 bounded , but the left hand side is in @xmath1533 , so this is again the standard @xmath1177 boundedness .",
    "since the elliptic parametrix construction works , elliptic estimates hold without conditions on @xmath39 in this setting . in our considerations , near the radial sets @xmath39 will be taken constant , so the previous results apply microlocally there .",
