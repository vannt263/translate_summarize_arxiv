    "the critical behaviour of statistical mechanical systems reduces to mean field theory above the upper critical dimension @xmath1 . in this case",
    ", the scaling relations between the critical exponents of the phase transition remain valid except the so - called hyperscaling relations , i.e. , the equalities in which the number @xmath2 of space dimensions of the system explicitly appears , like    @xmath3    for this reason one says that , above @xmath1 , _ hyperscaling breaks_. some time ago , coniglio @xcite proposed an interpretation of hyperscaling breaking for the pure random percolation problem : above the upper critical dimension the number of percolating clusters at the critical threshold , which is finite for @xmath4 , becomes infinite .",
    "the presence of infinitely many interpenetrating clusters damps the fluctuations of the order parameter establishing the mean field regime .",
    "the magnetization transition of the ising model can be equivalently described as a percolation transition of suitably defined site - bond clusters @xcite . in particular",
    ", the magnetization coincides with the percolation order parameter . that suggests an analogous interpretation of hyperscaling breaking as for random percolation :",
    "we tried to test this conjecture .",
    "we present here preliminary results , based on monte carlo simulations , concerning the multiplicity of percolating clusters at criticality both in random percolation and in the ising model above the upper critical dimension @xmath1 .",
    "we start from an hypercubic lattice with a fraction @xmath5 of occupied sites . near the critical density @xmath6 the singular part of the cluster number @xmath7 behaves as    @xmath8    ( @xmath9 is the number of clusters of size @xmath10 ) .",
    "the connectedness length @xmath11 , i.e. the typical radius of the largest finite cluster , diverges as    @xmath12    from eqs .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) one obtains    @xmath13    let us now assume that the singular behaviour comes only from the critical clusters , i.e. the clusters whose radius is about @xmath14 .",
    "say @xmath15 the number of such clusters in a volume of the order @xmath16 .",
    "the singular part of the cluster number is given by    @xmath17    if @xmath15 is of the order of unity , from eq .",
    "( 5 ) we obtain the hyperscaling relation ( 1 ) ; if instead @xmath15 grows with @xmath14 , so that , at the critical point , @xmath18 , then hyperscaling breaks down .    when there are infinitely many spanning clusters the percolation order parameter fluctuates over a distance @xmath19 ; this would simply explain why above @xmath1 the mean field solution is valid .",
    "besides , one finds that , above the upper critical dimension ( for random percolation @xmath20 ) ,    @xmath21",
    "if one builds clusters by joining nearest - neighbouring spins of the same sign with the bond probability @xmath22 ( @xmath23 is the ising coupling ) , the magnetization transition of the ising model becomes equivalent to the percolation transition of such clusters ( called fortuin - kasteleyn or fk clusters ) : the percolation temperature coincides with the thermal critical point @xmath0 and the critical percolation exponents are just the ising exponents . because of that one can interpret the ising transition as a simple geometrical phenomenon .",
    "therefore , the argument used above for the pure percolation problem can be extended to the ising case .",
    "one expects then that the number of fk clusters @xmath15 in a region of linear dimension @xmath14 is of the order of unity below @xmath24 , while above @xmath1    @xmath25    this implies that , above @xmath1 , there should be an infinite number of percolating fk clusters at the critical temperature .",
    "we warn that some care needs to be taken .",
    "the percolation transition of the fk clusters in the ising model is asymmetric on the two sides of @xmath0 : for @xmath26 , the percolation variables coincide with the thermal variables in any dimension , whereas for @xmath27 and @xmath28 , the thermal fluctuations are different from the cluster fluctuations .",
    "there are indeed arguments suggesting that the critical percolation exponents below @xmath0 , except @xmath29 , are different from the ising ones for @xmath30 and that the upper critical dimension of the fk clusters is @xmath31 , like in random percolation .",
    "the first numerical studies on the multiplicity of infinite clusters at and above the upper critical dimension were carried on by de arcangelis @xcite , but only small lattices could be used ( up to @xmath32 ) .",
    "we performed monte carlo simulations for pure random site percolation in several dimensions on hypercubic lattices . in any space dimension we calculated the number of distinct spanning clusters for different lattices at the critical density @xmath6 .",
    "we noticed that , for @xmath33 , there is almost always just a single percolating cluster ( or none ) , independently of the lattice size , whereas for @xmath34 we observed an `` explosion '' of the multiplicity of percolating clusters , which increases with the lattice side @xmath35 .",
    "our aim is to prove eq .",
    "( 6 ) which , at the critical point , assumes the following finite - size scaling form :    @xmath36    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we plot the multiplicity of the percolating clusters as a function of the linear dimension of the lattice .",
    "the linear fit of the data is excellent .",
    "we conclude that , at least for the particular case @xmath34 , eq . ( 6 )",
    "is correct .",
    "if there is a mismatch between the percolation and the thermal variables for @xmath28 , the percolation transition of the fk clusters would show quite an unusual behaviour , since the critical exponents would be different above and below @xmath0 .",
    "we investigated the ising model in @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 dimensions .",
    "we found that the behaviour below @xmath0 dominates , i.e. the finite - size scaling fits at @xmath0 return the values of the conjectured exponents for @xmath28 .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the variation of the multiplicity @xmath40 of the percolating clusters with the lattice side @xmath35 for the 5-dimensional ising model at @xmath0 .",
    "we observe a clear decrease of @xmath40 with @xmath35 , which is in contrast with eq .",
    "( 7 ) ! on the other hand , since the scaling behaviour at @xmath28 dominates , this result would confirm that the upper critical dimension @xmath41 .",
    "we decided then to check whether @xmath31 , as conjectured .",
    "for this purpose we investigated the 7-dimensional ising model and we determined for each lattice the peak of the percolating cluster multiplicity . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we plot the values of the maxima versus the lattice side @xmath35 : the points lie on a straight line , like in random percolation .",
    "our results clearly show that for random percolation hyperscaling breaks due to the presence of infinite percolating clusters at the critical point .    for the ising model",
    "the situation is more complicated because of the different behaviour of the percolation variables below and above @xmath0 .",
    "we found that the upper critical dimension of the fk clusters below @xmath0 is six , like in random percolation .",
    "what really matters for our geometrical interpretation of hyperscaling breaking is a relation between @xmath15 and @xmath14 such that @xmath15 increases with @xmath14 .",
    "it is then crucial to extrapolate numerically such a relation for @xmath42 .",
    "moreover , it is well known that the finite - size scaling behaviour above the upper critical dimension is anomalous because the relevant scale is no longer the correlation length @xmath14 but another length @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to check whether @xmath43 coincides with the above - mentioned geometrical fluctuation scale @xmath44 ."
