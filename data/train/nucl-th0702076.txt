    "@xcite by precision x - ray experiments on pionic hydrogen and pionic deuterium , yields the following picture .",
    "( i ) for small @xmath89 mev , a small value of @xmath90 is favored , in order for @xmath91 to be close to the experimental data . in this case , the dominant contribution to the nucleon masses comes from @xmath92 .",
    "( ii ) for large @xmath82 , a large value for @xmath90 is required such that @xmath91 is closer to the experimental data .",
    "this points towards a dominant contribution of the chiral condensate to the nucleon mass .",
    "( iii ) the effective range parameters are closer to the experimental data for large @xmath90 ; here , a small value for @xmath82 is clearly favored .",
    "( iv ) all @xmath72-wave scattering lengths come out too small in magnitude in order to compare reasonably well to the experimental data .",
    "this indicates the need to include other baryonic resonances , such as the @xmath93 .    in summary , the comparison of characteristic quantities for pion - nucleon scattering to experimental data does not unambiguously favor definite values for @xmath82 and @xmath90",
    "thus , it is not ( yet ) possible to make a clear - cut prediction as to whether the mass of the nucleon is dominantly generated by the chiral condensate or by mixing with its chiral partner .",
    "in this paper we have computed the pion - nucleon scattering lengths at tree - level in the framework of a gauged linear sigma model with parity - doubled nucleons . within the mirror assignment the mass of the nucleon",
    "originates only partially from the chiral condensate and does not vanish in the chirally restored phase .",
    "quantitative predictions to test this scenario represent an important topic in modern hadron physics .    in a first study , we were not able to identify a definite set of parameters of our model that would simultaneously describe all scattering data . therefore , a careful analysis of the dependence of the results on three key parameters is in order : the parameter @xmath94 equal to @xmath95 in the mesonic sector of the lagrangian but predicted to be @xmath96 by the ksfr relation , the mass of the @xmath87 meson , @xmath97 which can not be precisely determined due to the broadness of the corresponding resonance @xmath98-@xmath99 , and the mass of the chiral partner of the nucleon @xmath4 , which has not been yet unambiguously identified . indeed , useful information toward its identification can be extracted .",
    "then , by comparing the theoretical predictions with the experimental results we plan to determine , within our model , to which degree the nucleon mass originates from the chiral condensate and how this point is affected by the choice of the above mentioned parameters .    in a second step , we plan to extend our model by including the weinberg - tomozawa term @xcite which is necessary to correctly reproduce the axial coupling constant @xmath100 . further applications , such as the inclusion of the @xmath93 resonance and the study of radiative reactions , as the @xmath101-photoproduction , are also planned .",
