    "the standard model  ( sm ) has successfully described the fundamental interactions of elementary particles .",
    "it has nineteen free parameters , most of which belong to the masses of fermions and their mixing .",
    "additionally , the introduction of more parameters becomes necessary when the massive nature of neutrinos is considered .",
    "the observed mass spectrum , the mixing pattern , the fact that there appear to be only three generations of matter , the origin of charge - parity  ( cp ) violation , among other puzzles , lack an explanation within the theory , and are generically known as the flavour and cp problems respectively ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the common approach in attempts to solve the flavour puzzle , was by the addition of a horizontal symmetry acting on family space in a non - trivial fashion .",
    "the symmetry group which relates families in a non - trivial way is known as the family or flavour symmetry group . on the other hand ,",
    "it was also noticed that without adding a family symmetry , one can introduce texture zeroes in different positions of the mass matrices to obtain concise relations between mixing angles and mass ratios ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews ) . in the late nineteen sixties",
    "@xcite a relation between the cabibbo angle and a quark mass ratio , @xmath2 , was found .",
    "then , in the seventies , in a series of papers @xcite , the importance of this relation was realised and generalised in order to relate other mixing angles to mass ratios .",
    "we , as other authors , combine both approaches as a stepping stone to find analytical expressions for the mixing angles as functions of the mass ratios .",
    "the introduction to the sm of a non - abelian discrete family symmetry is the simplest way to relate families non - trivially .",
    "the smallest group among these symmetries is the permutational symmetry of three objects , @xmath0 .",
    "we remind the reader that there are basically two types of models based on the group @xmath0 . first , there are those models which have only one higgs field which is a doublet under @xmath3 and a singlet under @xmath0  @xcite . in these models",
    "the @xmath0 flavour symmetry must be broken in order to produce an acceptable pattern of mixing for fermions .",
    "second , there are the class of @xmath0-invariant models in which the @xmath0 symmetry is preserved as an exact but hidden symmetry of the low energy spectra after the electroweak symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "the latter models require the addition of at least two electroweak doublet higgs fields , besides the higgs field of the sm .",
    "of these three @xmath3 doublets , two of them are assigned to the doublet irreducible representation ( irrep ) of @xmath0 , and the third one is assigned to the singlet one .",
    "it is also possible to add extra abelian discrete symmetries , @xmath4 , to further reduce the number of parameters .    in the last decade and the first years of the present decade ,",
    "the experimental knowledge about the magnitudes of all nine elements of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark mixing matrix , as well as the jarlskog rephasing invariant , have had a remarkable improvement in precision and quality  @xcite . at the same time",
    ", we have witnessed a spectacular improvement in the determination of mixing and squared mass differences in the neutrino sector  @xcite . at present , it is crucial for the success of a model of quark and lepton mixing to either agree with the experimental information with great accuracy or , better , to predict accurately the observed mixing and mass patterns .    here , we build various @xmath0 models based on the two aforementioned types , _",
    "i.e. _ , a model with the sm higgs as an @xmath0 singlet and models with a total of three or four higgs @xmath3 doublets assigned to different irreducible representations of @xmath0 .",
    "we then compare the quark sector of the models with the most up to date data on quark masses and mixing .",
    "since @xmath0 models do not offer an explanation of the value of the quark masses , in order to confront the theoretical form of the ckm mixing with the experimental data , we need to perform a @xmath1 fit , where the observables should be four independent parameters of the ckm matrix , and the parameters to be adjusted should be the quark mass ratios and one free parameter for each type of quarks ( up and down ) .",
    "the mass ratios are not treated as free parameters , since we allow their values to vary within the three sigma region given by the best fit to experimental data measurements as given in the pdg  @xcite , and our computation at @xmath5 .",
    "we find a remarkable good quality of the @xmath1 fits for the different models in the allowed parameter space of each model .",
    "this will make it possible to discriminate among different models when measurements in the quark sector further improve .    in a follow up work  @xcite",
    ", we will confront the corresponding masses and mixing of the leptonic sector of each model with the most up to date experimental data .",
    "it is important to mention that our approach is at low energies , hence making no assumption of an ultraviolet completion of the theory .",
    "however , some of these scenarios can be embedded in grand unified theories ( see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the present work is organised as follows . in sections",
    "[ sec : s3asfamily]-[sec : higgssect ] , we present the basic ingredients of the @xmath0 models that we confront with the experimental data on quark masses and mixing . in section  [ sec : massmatrices ] , we present the form of the quark mass matrices and relate them to two texture zeroes or nearest neighbour interaction ( nni ) mass matrices . in this way",
    ", we are able to derive explicit analytical expressions for the elements of the ckm mixing matrix in terms of the quark mass ratios and a few free parameters . in section  [ sec : form_of_the_ckm ] , we present the prediction of the ckm matrix for each model . in section  [ sec : exp_and_fit ]",
    ", we present a detailed @xmath1 analysis of the ckm matrix elements and comment on the very good quality of the fit of our models to the most recent experimental data .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] with some remarks and an outlook of the present work .",
    "@xmath0 is the symmetry group of permutations of three objects , which can be geometrically represented by the different rotations that leave invariant an equilateral triangle .",
    "it has six elements , the smallest number of elements in non - abelian discrete groups .",
    "it has three irreducible representations ( irreps ) : a doublet @xmath7 , and two singlets , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , symmetric and anti - symmetric , respectively .",
    "the kronecker products of the irreps are : @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "the only non - trivial tensor product is that of two doublets , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which contains two singlets , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and one doublet , @xmath20 , where _ s = p_d1 q_d1 + p_d2q_d2 , _ a = p_d1q_d2 - p_d2q_d1 , + * r*_d^t = ( r_d1,r_d2 ) = ( p_d1 q_d2 + p_d2 q_d1 , p_d1 q_d1 - p_d2 q_d2 ) .",
    "so far , the experimental evidence points to the existence of only three generations of quarks and leptons @xcite , and we will work under this assumption .",
    "the sm lagrangian makes no distinction between the different families when no yukawa interactions are present .",
    "we take this as a theoretical suggestion of the possible family symmetry relating the three generations of matter . in the following section we will discuss first the matter content and then the higgs field content of the different models presented here .",
    "for fermions , when we choose a three dimensional representation of the group @xmath0 , according to the dimension of the fermion mass matrices , we are led to consider two different direct irreducible decompositions : @xmath21 , or , @xmath22 .",
    "then , the assignment of quark families to the irreducible @xmath0 representations is suggested by the observed mass hierarchy in each fermion sector & & m_u : m_c : m_t 10 ^ -6 : 10 ^ -3 : 1 , m_d : m_s : m_b 10 ^ -4 : 10 ^ -2 : 1 , + & & m_e : m _ : m _ 10 ^ -5 : 10 ^ -2 : 1 .",
    "hence , we generically assign the first two families , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , to the doublet representation , @xmath7 .",
    "then , the third family , @xmath25 , can be chosen to transform as a symmetric singlet representation , @xmath26  @xcite , or as an anti - symmetric singlet representation , @xmath27  @xcite . here",
    "we consider the two possibilities and compare the differences that arise among them .",
    "the fermions in the doublet representation are denoted by @xmath28 where @xmath29 or @xmath30 represent the family index of a left- or right - handed fermionic field , @xmath31 or @xmath32 , respectively . specifically for quarks we have [ eq : espnots3q ] & & f_iiil=(b_l , t_l )  , f_iiir = t_r ,  f_iiir = b_r + & & (    c f_il + f_iil    ) = (    c ( u_l , d_l ) + ( c_l , s_l ) +    ) , (    c f_ir + f_iir    ) _ f = u= (    c u_r + c_r +    ) , (    c f_ir + f_iir    ) _ f = d= (    c d_r + s_r +    ) , in these expressions , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are doublets under @xmath3 , while @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 are @xmath3 singlets .",
    "a state compatible with a sm - like higgs boson has recently been observed at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "we do not have yet any experimental information about the scalar sector of the sm at higher energies , thus it is natural to ponder what are the consequences of having more than one higgs doublet in extensions of the sm ( without susy ) .",
    "we thus explore here various scenarios with different numbers of higgs @xmath3 doublets .",
    "there are many possibilities to form @xmath0 invariant scalars with the fermions in the @xmath0 representations of  eq .   and the higgs fields assigned as @xmath39 the cases we consider are the following :    1 .   the sm with addition of an @xmath0 family symmetry , where a single higgs @xmath3 doublet is a singlet under @xmath0 .",
    "this model can only explain fermion masses and mixing angles when the @xmath0 symmetry is broken  @xcite .",
    "an @xmath0-invariant extension of the sm with three higgs @xmath3 doublets , either as @xmath40 and @xmath41 or as @xmath40 and @xmath42 .",
    "the choice of the symmetric or anti - symmetric singlet depends on the resulting form of the mass matrices we want to generate . here",
    "we consider only the invariant scalars that lead to forms of the mass matrices that are able to reproduce the measured values of the ckm matrix , namely the fritzsch two zeroes texture form , and the nearest neighbour interaction ( nni ) one .",
    "3 .   an @xmath0-invariant extension of the sm with four higgs @xmath3 doublets , which are assigned to all three irreducible representations of @xmath0 : @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .    in the following section",
    "we discuss the cases ii and iii .",
    "the general discussion of the case i can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , here we present its general features .",
    "this model has been thoroughly studied in the literature  @xcite , for completeness , we briefly present it here to compare it with the other models analysed in this work . in this case , the higgs boson of the sm is an @xmath43 doublet and , since it has no flavour , it is in a singlet representation of @xmath6 .",
    "when @xmath0 is an exact symmety and the field in the @xmath0 singlet representation is assigned to the fields in the third generation , then , in a symmetry adapted basis , all elements in the mass matrices should vanish except for the element ( 3,3 ) .",
    "hence , from the structure of the mass matrices , only the fermion that is assigned to the singlet representation of @xmath0 acquires mass , and the symmetry should be broken in order to give mass to the other families .",
    "realistic dirac fermion mass matrices could result from the flavour permutational symmetry @xmath44 and its spontaneous or explicit breaking according to the chain : @xmath45  @xcite .    under an exact @xmath44 symmetry , the mass spectrum for either the quark sector ( up or down quarks ) or the leptonic sector ( charged leptons or dirac neutrinos ) consists of one massive particle in a singlet irreducible representation and a pair of massless particles in a doublet irreducible representation of @xmath46 .",
    "thus , in the _ electroweak basis _ , the corresponding mass matrices , @xmath47 , are invariant with respect to a permutation of the family ( columns ) and flavour ( rows ) indices , and all entries in @xmath47 are equal , see eq .",
    "( 2.4 ) in  @xcite .",
    "once an explicit assignment of particles to the irreducible representations of @xmath6 is made , it is convenient to make a change of basis from the electroweak basis to a _ symmetry adapted _ or _ hiererchical basis _ by means of the unitary matrix that diagonalises the matrix @xmath47 , @xmath48 where @xmath49 in the electroweak basis the masses for the first two families are generated by introducing the terms , @xmath50 in the matrix @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are real numbers that parametrize the most general form of a matrix invariant under the permutations of the first two columns or rows . in @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56",

    "the term @xmath58 breaks the permutational symmetry @xmath46 down to @xmath59 and mixes the singlet and doublet representations of @xmath6 , while the term @xmath60 transforms as the mixed symmetry term of the doublet complex tensorial representation of the @xmath57 diagonal subgroup of @xmath44 .",

    "<S> @xmath0 models offer a low energy approach to describe the observed pattern of masses and mixing , of both quarks and leptons . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we first revisit an @xmath0 model with only one higgs electroweak doublet , where the flavour symmetry must be broken in order to produce an acceptable pattern of masses and mixing for fermions . </S>",
    "<S> then , we analyse different @xmath0 models , where the flavour symmetry is preserved as an exact , but hidden symmetry of the low energy spectra , after the electroweak symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> the latter models require the addition of two more higgs electroweak doublets which are accommodated in an @xmath0 doublet . </S>",
    "<S> we also explore the consequences of adding a fourth higgs electroweak doublet , thus occupying all three irreducible representations of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we show how the various @xmath0-invariant mass matrices of the different models can reproduce the two texture zeroes and nearest neighbour interaction matrix forms , which have been found to provide a viable and universal treatment of mixing for both quarks and leptons . </S>",
    "<S> we also find analytical and exact expressions for the ckm matrix of the models in terms of quark mass ratios . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we compare the expressions of the ckm matrix of the different @xmath0 models with the most up to date values of masses and mixing in the quark sector , via a @xmath1 analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the analytical expressions we derived reproduce remarkably well the most recent experimental data of the ckm matrix , suggesting that @xmath0 is a symmetry of the quark sector . </S>"
