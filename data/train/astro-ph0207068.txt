    "important input quantities for the quasilinear test - particle description of cosmic ray transport in weakly - turbulent astrophysical plasmas are the wavenumber power spectra of magnetic field fluctuations . within the plasma wave viewpoint",
    ", the plasma irregularities are usually modelled as a superposition of linear waves well below the ion cyclotron frequency , such as alfven and magnetosonic waves",
    ". however , the observed turbulence properties in the more distant interstellar and intergalactic plasmas are obtained from radio propagation measurements as dispersion measures , rotation measures and interstellar scintillation .",
    "these turbulence diagnostics are biased towards the high - density ionized interstellar phases with large volume filling factors , i.e. the diffuse intercloud gas and hii envelopes .",
    "in particular , dispersion measure and scintillation data are primarily diagnostics of density and only secondarily of magnetic field .",
    "these diagnostics demonstrate the existence of interstellar density irregularities with kolmogorov - type ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) frequency power spectra extending over 11 decades in frequency , much below ( @xmath2 ) the proton gyrofrequency ( rickett @xcite , armstrong et al .",

    "however , the plasma parameter of the diffuse intercloud medium @xmath4 is much smaller than unity , so that a kinetic description of the electromagnetic turbulence seems to be necessary .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to provide the relation between electron density and magnetic field fluctuations on the basis of the linear kinetic plasma theory . in paper",
    "ii of this series we will use the kinetic turbulence relations to calculate frequency power spectra of electron density fluctuations from anisotropic power spectra of magnetic field fluctuations in the form of alfven and magnetosonic waves .",
    "such anisotropic interstellar magnetic field power spectra are required in order to be in accord with the heating / cooling balance of the diffuse intercloud medium ( lerche & schlickeiser @xcite ) .",
    "according to rickett ( @xcite ) , spangler ( @xcite ) , lerche & schlickeiser ( @xcite ) the diffuse intercloud gas can be well modelled as an isotropic maxwellian plasma with the following plasma and turbulence parameters : @xmath5 g , @xmath6 @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 cm s@xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 cm s@xmath10 , @xmath13 cm @xmath10 with @xmath14 cm , @xmath15 cm@xmath10 with @xmath17 cm . @xmath18 and",

    "the basic procedure to identify these variations has been originally given for the solar wind plasma by wu & huba ( @xcite ) .",
