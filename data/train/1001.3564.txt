    "a common example of environment is the quantized electromagnetic field , typically modeled as an infinite chain of non - interacting quantum harmonic oscillators .",
    "the coupling of the quantum system to the environment is described by the spectral density function . if the system couples to all modes of the environment in an equal way the spectrum of the reservoir is flat . if , instead , the spectral density function strongly varies with the frequency of the environmental oscillators , the environment is said to be structured .",
    "structured environments arise in many physical situations , e.g. , in photonic band - gap materials and lossy optical cavities @xcite . in these systems",
    "the reservoir memory effects induce a feedback of information from the environment into the system .",

    "the memory effects due to the reservoir structure are contained in time - dependent decay rates .",
    "we show that , for short initial times , the dependence of the decay rates on the driving laser is more complicated than the one presented in ref .",
    "for these short initial times , indeed , the spontaneous decay of the atom can not only be suppressed or enhanced , but also partly reversed , when non - markovian oscillations induced by reservoir memory effects are present .    the importance of the driven two - state model is especially pronounced in quantum computation and quantum technologies , where one or more driven qubits constitute the basic building block of quantum logic gates @xcite .",

    "the time - scale for nonsecular phenomena ranges typically from small to intermediate in comparison with the time - scale for relaxation processes and therefore the secular approximation may not be consistent with studies of non - markovian dynamics . a recent article by cummings and hu further elucidates the importance of nonsecular studies on open quantum systems @xcite .",
    "our investigation of the effects of nonsecular terms on the dynamics of the driven two - state system brings to light the existence of nonsecular oscillations in the population of the two - state system .",

    "contrarily to the oscillations due to non - markovianity , nonsecular oscillations persist for times much longer than the reservoir correlation time .",
    "moreover , our analysis shows that the nonsecular terms affect also the asymptotic long time values of the bloch vector components , i.e. , their impact exceeds the time - scale of nonsecular oscillations .    finally , an important result we present in the paper is the analysis of conditions for complete positivity ( cp ) of the system .",
