    "there has been a lot of interest over the years @xcite in the specific application of noncommutative geometry@xcite to the commutative algebra of functions on a finite set @xmath3 ( usually a finite group ) in which the differential forms do not commute with functions .",
    "this provides a systematic way of handling geometry on finite lattices which , at the level of cohomology , electromagnetism and yang - mills theory has already proven interesting and computable .",
    "notably , @xcite contains the moduli of @xmath4-yang - mills on the permutation group @xmath5 while @xcite quantizes @xmath4-yang - mills theory on the finite group @xmath6 .    in this paper",
    "we want systematically to extend this theory to the gravitational case .",
    "some first steps are in @xcite , to which the present paper is a sequel .",
    "it was shown there that finite groups have indeed a natural riemannian geometry in a vielbein and frame - bundle formalism@xcite which was worked out in detail for @xmath5 ( it turns out to have @xmath7 essentially proportional to the metric , i.e. an ` einstein manifold ' ) .",
    "similarly , the alternating group @xmath8 was considered in @xcite and has an essentially unique invariant metric with 4-bein and an associated spin connection with nonzero curvature but with ricci=0 , i.e. solves the vacuum einstein equations .",
    "hence the system of equations for a framed quantum riemannian manifold is already known to have interesting nontrivial solutions . however ,",
    "for quantum gravity ( or classical but finite gravity ) we need a better understanding of the moduli spaces of _ all _ metrics , connections etc . and",
    "this is what we study now on small sets .",
    "once one has this , one can in principle begin to quantize this moduli space in a path integral approach , i.e. quantum gravity .",
    "section  2 starts with a brief account of the formalism for algebras which we then rapidly specialise to the case @xmath9 , the algebra of functions in a finite set . that the theory is a specialisation of a functorial construction that is formulated for general algebras ensures that it is not ad - hoc (",
    "indeed , this same theory can be specialised to classical geometry and to q - deformed geometry for other choices of algebra@xcite ) .",
    "following @xcite , we find that for finite sets @xmath3 the classification of ` differential forms ' or exterior algebras of parallelizable type reduces to the classification of finite regular graphs with vertices @xmath3 and a fixed number @xmath10 arrows from every vertex .",
    "new results are theorem  2.1 showing in detail that the calculus is then inner , and theorem  2.2 for the construction of 2-forms .",
    "both are needed in the paper .",
    "further ingredients in the formalism are a choice of @xmath10-beins and a frame group @xmath11 ( in our case a finite group ) acting on the vector space spanned by them .",
    "this gives the moduli of ` quantum framed manifold ' structure on @xmath3 .",
    "after this , one may look for a compatible connection @xmath12 , find the riemann curvature and from this the ricci tensors and ricci scalar . in this way we set up the theory that we are going to explore for small numbers of points .    in section 3.1",
    "we analyze the case @xmath13 of two points and frame groups @xmath14 acting on an einbein @xmath15 parametrised by a function @xmath16 .",
    "we find that for each einbein there is a natural generalized levi - civita connection @xmath17 for any function @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the average value over the two points .",
    "this has zero riemannian curvature , which emerges as a typical feature on two points . in our spin connection",
    "approach we find also the moduli of spin connections ; for @xmath20 framing we have a unique spin connection underlying @xmath12 . for @xmath21",
    "we find a larger moduli of spin connections , with gauge curvature , underlying the riemannian geometry itself ( all giving the same @xmath12 ) .    in section 3.2",
    "we similarly cover the case @xmath22 of three points and frame groups @xmath23 acting on a zweibein .",
    "the zweibein moduli space is itself nontrivial as an algebraic variety but we show how put a generic point into a canonical form , and then study spin connections for a fixed zweibein .",
    "a general feature for three points emerges , namely that in all our models the ricci scalar vanishes , but the riemann and ricci tensors themselves generically do not . for @xmath24",
    "we have a linear constraint on the zweibein to admit a connection , after which there is a 1-parameter family of connections . for @xmath21",
    "there is no constraint on the zweibein and a 8-dimensional moduli of connections .",
    "the canonical form for the vielbeins obtained in our analysis of 2 and 3 points in section  3 is one where ( after linear transformations ) , one may restrict to vielbeins which have only a scalar @xmath25 associated to each edge . in section  4",
    "we proceed to restrict attention to this canonical form , now for four point sets .",
    "physically , the modulus of the veilbein assigns a ` length ' to each edge , while the natural connectivity for 4 points is that of @xmath6 ( interpreted as a discrete model of a torus ) , which we consider in section  4.1 to  4.3 ; we consider various frame groups , among them an interesting choice ( section  4.2 ) is a frame group @xmath26 of ` quarter rotations ' again as a discrete model of a torus ; we find the most general connection , its riemann and ricci curvatures , etc .",
    "this model has the feature ( theorem  4.4 ) that a fully metric compatible spin connection is determined uniquely by the zweibein , but with the latter further constrained .",
    "by contrast , our weaker skew metric compatible or cotorsion free condition admits further parameters @xmath27 with the zweibein relatively unconstrained .",
    "we also see what happens if one takes too big a calculus on the frame group , namely additional unphysical modes emerge which do not , however , enter into the covariant derivative .",
    "this seems to us an important lesson for finite manifold - building by these methods .",
    "section  4.4 completes the picture by covering the alternative connectivity of 4 points joined in a tetrahedron , which is more like a sphere . here with @xmath28 frame group of ` one third ' rotations we find an unusual but interesting calculus , moduli etc without classical analogue .",
    "later , in section  5 we make some first remarks on the quantum theory , including a look at the discrete torus model on @xmath29 .",
    "mainly , we find what we show on this model to be a reasonable unitarity or * -structure on the system which is needed to reduce the functional integrals to real variables .",
    "we do not try to do the integrals themselves , which would be beyond the scope of our current analysis .",
    "finally , section  6 return to a more qualitative account of all bidirectional framed geometries up to 9 points , deduced from the known atlas of graphs@xcite .",
    "this covers the connectivity or topological aspect of the vielbein moduli space . at this level",
    "a vielbein amounts to a colouring of the graph into @xmath10-colours . for each such vielbein",
    ", there are further continuous degrees of freedom for matrices @xmath30 labelled according to the colouring @xmath31 ( as seen in detail in section  3 ) .",
    "if we ignore these then we have a in principle a ` combinatorial quantum gravity ' in which one sums over all such colourings .",
    "let us note that ` geometry ' on finite sets in some form or other has a long pedigree .",
    "common to all approaches is the basic data of ` differentials ' as defined by directed edges between vertices ( a ` digraph ' or quiver ) .",
    "such objects are used in representation theory for quivers formed on dynkin diagrams .",
    "one also considers in that context some kind of ` vector bundles ' with vector spaces over each vertex albeit of varying dimension .",
    "similarly in physics as well as in simplicial cohomology one may ` approximate ' a manifold by a finite triangulation and work on that . from the algebraic point of view",
    "one does not actually need bidirectional edges , e.g. every poset defines a connectivity graph and differential calculus with @xmath32 if @xmath33 ( albeit not a parallelisable one if it is finite ) .",
    "this would be relevant to modelling lorentzian manifolds@xcite with @xmath32 modeling a time - like path from @xmath34 to @xmath35 .",
    "hence the deeper notions of vielbeins and riemannian geometry that we develop on such data potentially has several applications .",
    "here we briefly recall the formalism of @xcite . to tie in with the general theory we start with a brief recap over general algebras in section  2.1 .",
    "then in section  2.2 we specialise to the finite set case in more detail than outlined in @xcite .",
    "we cover here only the parallelizable case where the frame bundle algebra has a trivial tensor product form .",
    "there is a still more general theory where the bundle is nontrivial , see @xcite , but this needs much more machinery and we do not cover it here .",
    "it would be needed for finite posets , for example .",
    "let @xmath36 be a unital algebra .",
    "we equip @xmath36 with a differential structure in the sense @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is an @xmath39 bimodule , and @xmath40 .",
    "this is a notion common to all approaches to noncommutative geometry including @xcite .",
    "we also need @xmath41 or ( in principle ) higher @xmath42 with @xmath43 , for which we can take the maximal prolongation of @xmath38 or any of its quotients .    in this context",
    "we define a ( left ) _ vielbein _ of @xmath44-bein as a collection @xmath45 forming an @xmath36-basis of 1-forms @xmath46 , i.e. @xmath47 where @xmath48",
    ". one can also think equivalently of the @xmath44-bein as a map @xmath49 as in @xcite if we regard @xmath44 as a fixed abstract vector space .",
    "given a vielbein we deduce operators @xmath50 where @xmath51 as an expression of the bimodule and exterior derivative structure .",
    "next , we assume that we actually have an @xmath52-vielbein , i.e. we require @xmath44 to be an @xmath52-comodule under a hopf algebra @xmath52 .",
    "there is also a more general theory with @xmath52 merely a coalgebra , i.e. this is not a critical assumption .",
    "we fix a left - covariant differential structure @xmath53 on the fiber of the frame bundle . like lie groups , quantum groups",
    "are always parallelisable and hence @xmath54 for some space of invariant 1-forms @xmath55 .",
    "this is a quotient of the augmentation ideal @xmath56 of @xmath52 ( classically it means the functions that vanish at the group identity ) , i.e. @xmath57 for some left ideal @xmath58 .",
    "we call @xmath59 the associated ` quantum tangent space ' , where we suppose @xmath55 is finite dimensional and @xmath60 a hopf algebra dually paired with @xmath52 ( it plays the role classically of the enveloping algebra of the lie algebra of the frame group )",
    ". we will be interested only in the bicovariant case as in @xcite where one knows from the worononwicz theory @xcite that @xmath55 is @xmath61-stable or that @xmath62 inherits @xmath61 as a ` quantum lie bracket ' .",
    "when @xmath52 is coquasitriangular one knows that @xmath62 is in fact a braided - lie algebra @xcite .",
    "however , neither assumption is critical for the geometry .",
    "we let @xmath63 be a basis of @xmath62 and we denote by @xmath64 its left action inherited from the left action of @xmath60 on @xmath44 corresponding to the coaction of @xmath52 .",
    "it is only this action which is needed in the formulae below . in this basis",
    "a spin connection means a collection of 1-forms @xmath65 .",
    "its torsion tensor corresponds to @xmath66 and we are interested in torsion - free connections .",
    "we also ( optionally ) impose a regularity or ` differentiability ' condition linking @xmath41 and @xmath53 , namely @xmath67 this ensures that the component 2-forms @xmath68 of the curvature of the spin connection , namely @xmath69 have a proper geometrical interpretation as a curvature 2-form with values in @xmath62 . here",
    "@xmath70 are structure constants of the product of @xmath60 projected to @xmath62 ( where @xmath71 is a dual basis of @xmath55 ) .    for metrics we specialise to the case @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a nondegenerate @xmath60-invariant ` local metric ' .",
    "this is not the most general setup up in @xcite@xcite , where one can consider @xmath74 an arbitrary ( but nondegenerate ) 2-form . in our case",
    "the cotorsion - free condition , which is the natural generalisation of levi - civita metric compatibility in @xcite@xcite , is vanishing of @xmath75 where @xmath76 denotes the antipode of @xmath60 .    finally , we specialise to the case of @xmath41 constructed from an @xmath60-equivariant projection @xmath77 according to the scheme indicated in @xcite . from the above , we know that @xmath78 allowing us to define surjections @xmath79 where we quotient out @xmath80 .",
    "in fact we define @xmath81 as a quadratic algebra on @xmath44 with relations @xmath82 , and @xmath83 .",
    "such a scheme imposes constraints on @xmath84 . in this setting",
    "there is a canonical lift @xmath85    finally , we let @xmath86 define the components in the @xmath44-bein basis of the lifted @xmath87 . then @xmath88 the full riemann curvature of the connection and the covariant derivative acting on 1-forms are @xmath89 where @xmath90 .",
    "the derivation of these local formulae from a more abstract theory is in @xcite , in an equivalent comodule notation .",
    "we now specialise the above to the case @xmath91 where @xmath3 is a finite set and @xmath92 where @xmath11 is a finite group . in this case",
    "the possible @xmath93 are given by subsets @xmath94 of ` allowed directions ' .",
    "this is already known from @xcite and @xmath95 is the same as the structure of a quiver or digraph with vertex set @xmath3 and the notation @xmath32 whenever @xmath96 . in the geometrical examples we typically expect @xmath95 symmetric or ` bidirectional ' i.e. for every edge @xmath32 there is an edge @xmath97 , but we do not assume this in general . explicitly , @xmath98 + note also that the @xmath99-fold product @xmath100 i.e. the linear span of the set of @xmath99-arcs .",
    "the bimodule structures are the pointwise ones for products from the extreme left and right .",
    "as explained in @xcite a vielbein in this setting is possible _ iff _",
    "@xmath95 fibers over @xmath3 i.e. @xmath101 have cardinality @xmath10 ( say ) , independent of @xmath34 . in this case",
    "an @xmath10-bein is the specification of invertible @xmath102 matrices @xmath103 for each @xmath104 . here",
    "@xmath105 has indices @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "we write the inverses as @xmath108 with @xmath109 in this case the operators ( [ rhodel ] ) are @xmath110    a calculus on an algebra @xmath36 is inner if there is a 1-form @xmath111 with @xmath112 $ ] for @xmath113 .    cf@xcite a finite set calculus equipped with a vielbein is inner , @xmath114 moreover , the maximal prolongation exterior algebra @xmath115 has likewise @xmath116 ( graded anticommutator ) and is generated by @xmath9 and the quadratic algebra on the @xmath45 with relations @xmath117    we define @xmath111 as stated .",
    "then the explicit formulae ( [ rhodelsig ] ) allow one to verify that @xmath112 $ ] for any function @xmath18 , as required .",
    "the maximal prolongation of the @xmath118 is defined as the tensor algebra over @xmath91 modulo the relations in degree 2 imposed by extending @xmath119 as a superderivation with @xmath43 .",
    "more precisely , we lift any 1-form to the universal differential calculus over @xmath9 , apply the universal exterior derivative there , and then project down to @xmath120 . that this should be well - defined defines the minimal relations in degree 2 ( which are the only ones imposed in the maximal prolongation ) . in our case as basis of the kernel of the projection to @xmath118 is given by @xmath121 whenever @xmath122 , so we require for each such @xmath123 the relation @xmath124 we compute @xmath125 where @xmath126 denotes a functional dependence on points in @xmath3 and we adopt the convention that @xmath127 if @xmath128 . note also that @xmath129 by([rhodelsig ] ) and ( [ einvsig ] ) .",
    "the latter also implies that @xmath130 if @xmath107 .",
    "hence @xmath131 the first and last term vanish for @xmath132 and the second term for @xmath133 .",
    "hence in this case we obtain precisely the relation stated from the remaining third term .",
    "this completes the proof of the result mentioned in @xcite .",
    "it is then a computation to write @xmath134 and obtain @xmath135 .",
    "note that the compatibility of @xmath119 with the relations ( [ rhodel ] ) for all @xmath18 more or less requires this relation since applying @xmath119 to ( [ rhodel ] ) gives @xmath136 after using ( [ rhodel ] ) and that the calculus is inner .",
    "@xmath137    we note in passing that that by similar computations the maximal prolongation has @xmath138 which ( in view of the relations for @xmath139 ) has contributions only from @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "this is not necessarily zero , i.e. @xmath111 is not necessarily closed ( rather , @xmath142 so that @xmath143 is always a zero curvature @xmath4 connection ) .",
    "we also require for a @xmath11-covariant vielbein that @xmath48 is a @xmath11 module .",
    "the above constructions are all @xmath11-covariant under these local transformations of @xmath44 . to define more general exterior algebras @xmath115 we let @xmath77 be a @xmath11-equivariant projection operator , with components defined by @xmath144 .",
    "we define operators @xmath145 on the space spanned by 2-arcs with fixed endpoints @xmath146 .",
    "@xmath84 defines an exterior algebra with @xmath43 as a quotient of the tensor algebra on @xmath44 by the quadratic relations @xmath147 _ iff _",
    "@xmath148    @xmath149    we identify @xmath150 with @xmath151 via the vielbein so that @xmath84 induces left - module projection operators on this .",
    "these are therefore given by projection matrices @xmath152 on the space spanned by the 2-arcs from @xmath34 , for each @xmath34 .",
    "their components are @xmath153 we require that these are also right module maps , which is the condition ( i ) stated .",
    "it means that @xmath154 for a family of projections @xmath155 for each fixed @xmath146 .",
    "these are the operators ( [ pixz ] ) .",
    "as explained in @xcite there is then a condition on the family of projectors to ensure that the quotient @xmath156 factors through the maximal prolongation , namely the condition ( ii ) .",
    "this is necessary and sufficient for the relations in @xmath139 defined by @xmath157 to be compatible with the extension of @xmath119 to 2-forms via the graded leibniz rule .",
    "@xmath137    the maximal prolongation in theorem  2.1 can be viewed as given by a generalisation of this construction in which the projection @xmath84 is allowed to vary from point to point , i.e. a field of projections @xmath152 .",
    "the more specific construction in theorem  2.2 is necessarily a quotient of it by further relations .",
    "finally , we fix an @xmath61-stable subset @xmath158 with @xmath159 ( @xmath160 here the group identity ) , e.g. a nontrivial conjugacy class .",
    "these describe the bicovariant calculi @xmath161 in the woronowicz theory@xcite .",
    "the space of invariant forms @xmath55 in @xmath161 has basis @xmath162 .",
    "the dual basis of @xmath62 is @xmath63 with @xmath163 .",
    "the torsion and cotorsion equations then have the same form ( [ tor ] ) and ( [ cotor ] ) , with @xmath164 the group algebra antipode .",
    "the regularity condition now reads @xmath165 this is empty if we chose the universal calculus on @xmath11 ( where @xmath166 ) , but in general it is a quadratic constraint .",
    "the curvature form is then @xmath167 the formulae for the ricci and riemann tensors and @xmath12 have the same form ( [ rienabla ] ) .",
    "in this section we describe the moduli space of possible vielbeins and metrics on 2 or 3 points , and moduli of spin connections and their curvature for some points in the moduli of vielbeins with respect to frame group @xmath168 or @xmath5 .    more precisely , the moduli of possible vielbeins is in the first place labelled by two natural numbers @xmath169 and @xmath10 a fixed number of arcs from each point . for each @xmath170 , the combinatorial part of the moduli space",
    "consists of determining all possible quiver structures with no self - arcs , i.e. all @xmath171 with @xmath101 of cardinality @xmath10 at each @xmath104 .",
    "we interpret it as finding all possible parallelizable @xmath93 with @xmath10-dimensional cotangent space .",

    "there is only one possibility , namely @xmath176 and the quiver @xmath177 up to relabellings .",
    "this is the universal calculus on @xmath3 where @xmath95 is as large as possible .    for @xmath178 or @xmath22",

    "this seems to give reasonable results for @xmath180 and a small number of points ( in general it would be too restrictive ) .",
    "for @xmath176 we choose @xmath184 ( the choice @xmath185 is also allowed but not very interesting ) .",
    "more generally , we should determine all possible equivariant @xmath77 for choice of frame group @xmath11 and a representation @xmath44 of dimension @xmath10 .",
    "the representation theory of @xmath11 then dictates the possible equivariant projection matrices @xmath77 .",

    "the invariant local metric @xmath193 up to a normalisation is also classified by representation theory and we take it as the generator of the natural trivial representation in the decomposition of @xmath194 .    fixing all the above quasi - combinatorial data , we have a moduli space @xmath195 consisting of @xmath196 @xmath102 invertible matrices subject to the constraints in theorem  2.2 .",
    "we divide by an overall @xmath197 acting on the left and corresponding to a change of basis of @xmath44 .",
    "we arrive at a certain algebraic variety which we shall describe first .    finally , for a fixed vielbein and the above data , we look at the moduli of spin connections for @xmath193 .",

    "is reflected in the two physical curvature parameters @xmath538 .",
    "this model is obviously far from classical , but we see that it has several reasonable features including a cyclic symmetry and a degree 2 top form , i.e. a nonclassical surface.",
    "so far we have solved only for the classical geometry which could form the basis for classical equations of motion for gravity and matter in a classical background . for quantum theory at least in a path integral approach one must integrate over all such moduli spaces with respect to an action weighting . here quantum gravity , in particular , diverges badly .",
    "the advantage of working only on a finite number of points as we have done above is that now such functional integrals become finite dimensional integrals , which may still diverge but which are surely much more tractable .",
    "such integrals for gauge theory on @xmath335 are discussed in @xcite and carried to fruition for yang - mills on @xmath29 in @xcite , where the theory was found to be divergent but renormalisable .",
    "here we make some first remarks about how to extend this in principle to the gravitational case .",
    "the new ingredient not yet covered is the correct unitarity or reality conditions on the spin connection , which we now propose .",
    "thus , until now we could have worked above over a generic field , but now we must really we work over @xmath187 and specify reality or ` unitarity ' conditions which should be expected for a physical interpretation .",
    "this cuts down our moduli still further and also reduces us to integration over real variables in our finite setting . to do this",
    ", we note that @xmath539 is a @xmath540-algebra with @xmath540 given by pointwise complex conjugation .",
    "we extend this to inner calculi with the assumption @xmath541 so that @xmath540 anticommutes with @xmath119 ( other conventions are also possible ) . for models based on groups and conjugacy classes with elements of order 2 this",
    "is naturally implemented by @xmath542 ( more generally , @xmath543 ) , as in @xcite . for the models based on @xmath6 connectivity in section  4 we take @xmath544 .",
    "we likewise , and more importantly , we take @xmath545 which ensures that @xmath116 behaves as usual for a @xmath540 structure in the differential graded algebra ( so @xmath119 graded - commutes with @xmath540 ) . in terms of field components",
    "this translates to @xmath546 this is consistent with our model in section  4 , for example , where the condition ( [ constraint ] ) on @xmath16 in section  4.1 for a 2-form projector is invariant under @xmath540 .",
    "next , we consider the spin connection components . for a unitary action for the braided - lie algebra generators",
    "@xmath199 we would take @xmath547 .",
    "what is a unitary action is motivated from hopf algebra theory where the action of a hopf @xmath540-algebra one would require @xmath548 , where in our case @xmath549 is inversion in the frame group algebra .",
    "the @xmath540-structure on the braided - lie algebra generators which is not so clear , but if we assumed that @xmath550 as for elements in a group algebra , these two inverses cancel and we would be led to require @xmath551 .",
    "this indeed holds for the actions in the present paper , particularly those in section  4 , since these are obtained from permutations .",
    "next , if the generators are unitary in this sense , we want the frame group connection to be antihermitian so we propose here @xmath552 for the component 1-forms .",
    "this has the reasonable consequence that applying @xmath540 to the torsion equations gives the cotorsion equations , i.e. these are related by complex conjugation in the unitary version of the theory .",
    "this is desirable as it suggests that imposing the unitarity condition on the moduli space of torison and cotorsion free connections is not so likely to give no solutions .",
    "this too is bourne out when we look closely at the moduli of connections on our @xmath6 in proposition  4.2 or  4.5 .",
    "we concentrate on the second of these as the more physical model with modes @xmath27 .",
    "the reality condition in the moduli of torsion free and cotorsion free connections on the discrete torus in proposition  4.5 is @xmath553 , @xmath554 .",
    "the regularity condition is invariant under conjugation and the ricci scaler in proposition  4.5 is real up to a ` total divergence ' given by @xmath555 .    from the above",
    ", we deduce from proposition  4.5 and the reality condition on the @xmath111 , we find @xmath556 , @xmath557 which translates as stated given that the functions @xmath27 reverse sign under @xmath558 .",
    "the latter also means that @xmath559 , and similarly @xmath560 is @xmath561-invariant . since @xmath562 , and similarly with @xmath561 for @xmath563",
    ", we see that the regularity condition is invariant under @xmath540 .",
    "we then compute @xmath564 where @xmath565 , and similarly for @xmath566 . @xmath137",
    "the reduced moduli space with full metric compatibility in proposition  4.7 is also consistent with this @xmath540-structure , i.e. our reality condition holds for @xmath27 given by @xmath567 as stated there .",
    "moreover , the stated condition on the @xmath567 required for this reduces simply to @xmath27 real .",
    "after that , for quantum gravity one should presumably take as action @xmath568 using the ricci scalar curvature ; we are not in a position to deduce field equations by a variational principle , so this is an assumption of one way to make sense of the quantum theory . to see how this works",
    "we again look at our discrete torus model on 4 points .",
    "we already know from section 3 that for 2 or 3 points the ricci scalar vanishes in all our models , so this model would be the first with nontrivial ricci scalar . from the above propostition  5.1",
    "we see that the action @xmath76 is real . moreover , our fields @xmath27 etc are functions on the four points but so highly constrained as to be fully determined each by a single complex number , which we denote @xmath569 .",
    "here @xmath570 @xmath571",
    "note that the ricci scaler splits up into two terms @xmath572 and the similar expression for @xmath573 with @xmath574 interchanged .",
    "writing @xmath575 we find @xmath576 where we compute @xmath577 at the four points in terms of our new variables and add up . similarly for the @xmath52 field and @xmath578 .",
    "if we restrict to the full metric compatibility in theorem  4.4 then the action is just @xmath579 and the dynamical variables are @xmath580 constrained such that @xmath581 is real .",
    "again similarly for the @xmath52 system .    finally , we make a polar decomposition of the fields as @xmath582 in terms of real positive @xmath583 and angles @xmath584 . in terms of these",
    ", we find @xmath585 with similar results for the @xmath52 system .",
    "then quantum gravity is reduced to integrals over these real variables .",
    "there remains the constraint ( [ constraint ] ) as well as the optional regularity condition to be imposed on the moduli in proposition  4.5 .",
    "these both cross - couple the @xmath52 and @xmath586 systems making even this simplest model nontrivial .",
    "it is not our scope to consider the quantum theory in detail here , particularly since the geometries in this paper are low dimensonal , where one does not expect very dynamical quantum gravity ; for a compact surface in two dimensions the integral of the classical ricci scalar is a constant by the gauss - bonnet theorem . for a classical torus",
    "this should be zero , so we see that the discrete torus model already exhibits non - standard behaviour , the meaning of which remains to be understood .",
    "it also remains to identify physical observables to be computed by such functional integral methods .",
    "however , our low - dimensional example does indicate the possibility of reasonable unitarity constraints and illustrate how a quantum gravity theory might proceed in principle .",
    "for higher numbers of points we do not attempt a detailed classification but rather we overview the range of possibilities with a view to picking out the most interesting ones .    in the first place , we now limit ourselves to the more interesting case of symmetric ( ` bidirectional ' ) differential calculi .",
    "these are just graphs with no self - edges and no more than one edge between vertices . for a fibration with fiber size @xmath10 ,",
    "these are the so - called @xmath10-regular graphs .",
    "there is no classification theory for @xmath10-regular graphs ( eg any @xmath10-regular simplicial approximation of a manifold gives one ) but small ones are listed in @xcite .",
    "from there we see that there is a reasonable number for @xmath587 after which the number grows rapidly .",
    "we deal only with connected graphs .    note also for any @xmath196 that here are none for @xmath176 ( except @xmath175 ) . for @xmath180",
    "there is just the @xmath196-gon for all @xmath196 .",
    "this is the differential calculus on @xmath588 with @xmath589 .",
    "for @xmath590 there is exactly the universal calculus or totally connected graph .",
    "we observe that the @xmath196-gon and universal calculi are members of a ` circulant graph ' family @xmath591 where @xmath592 are distinct integers modulo @xmath196 .",
    "they correspond to the calculus on @xmath588 with @xmath593 where we only have @xmath594 if @xmath595 mod @xmath196 , etc .",
    "the direct product of circulants with @xmath596 means with @xmath597 ( as for the product of any groups equipped with differential structures , see @xcite ) .",
    "an example of a circulant is in figure  1 .",
    "note also the ` handshaking lemma ' in graph theory that @xmath598 has to be even .",
    "then we have the following list of connected graphs which is complete up to @xmath599 :            * for @xmath606 * we have only the 6-gon at @xmath180 and two choices at @xmath603 .",
    "these are the circulant @xmath607 , which is also the graph for the @xmath5 calculus with its 2-cycles conjugacy class , and the circulant @xmath608 . at @xmath605",
    "we have only the circulant @xmath609 , which is a triangulation of the sphere and is also the graph for @xmath5 with a left - covariant calculus . see fig 1 ( a),(b ) . at @xmath610",
    "we just have the universal one .",
    "note that the 3-cycles calculus on @xmath5 is not connected so does not appear in this list .    * for @xmath611 * we have only the 7-gon at @xmath180 , none at @xmath612 and two choices at @xmath605 .",
    "one is the circulant @xmath613 and the other is shown in fig 1 ( c ) . at @xmath614 we just have the universal one .    * for @xmath599",

    "1(b ) ) , which is @xmath629 .",
    "there are none at @xmath610 and three at @xmath614 of which two are circulants on @xmath630 , and so forth .",
    "1(d ) also shows an important @xmath631 graph with @xmath603 which is a @xmath632 quotient of the dodecahedron and can be thought of as a discrete @xmath633 .      at the qualitative or ` topological ' level of this section",
    ", we can immediately present one discrete moduli space of combinatorial solutions for vielbeins .",
    "namely , for any @xmath95 that fibers over @xmath3 with @xmath635 , an @xmath10-bein is provided by any choice of bijections @xmath636 by @xmath637 giving @xmath638 here @xmath639 is a function on @xmath3 ( with @xmath126 denoting the functional dependence ) .",
    "pictorially , we label all 1-arcs arbitrarily by @xmath640 and @xmath641 is the endpoint of the arc labelled @xmath31 from @xmath34 .",
    "the element @xmath111 and the relations of the maximal prolongation are @xmath642 the corresponding projectors are @xmath643 and have a functional dependence .",
    "since the wedge product is given by setting to zero the elements of the tensor product which are in the kernel of this projector , we have the lift @xmath644 given by the same formula .",
    "these formulae are for general left - parallelizable calculi . in our bidirectional case",
    "each arc really means two arrows since we can move along it in either direction . in this case",
    "the combinatorial data @xmath645 for this class of vielbeins is a bicolouring of the graph , with two colours @xmath646 for each arc , namely one for each arrow .",
    "moveover , we can follow the coloured arrows from vertex to vertex and in this way the doubled - up graph ( in which each arc is a pair of arrows going in opposite directions ) is decomposed into coloured loops . the loops of each colour need not be connected .",
    "for the framed geometry one must also choose a frame group @xmath11 acting on the vector space @xmath44 spanned by the vielbeins , a calculus on the group given by an ad - stable subset , and projectors @xmath84 .",
    "for the combinatorial solutions above it is natural to take @xmath647 acting by permuting the colours , i.e. @xmath648 for a permutation @xmath74",
    ". we can then take ( for example ) the universal differential calculus on @xmath649 where @xmath650 so that there is no regularity condition to solve when we use the braided - lie algebra with basis @xmath63",
    ". then the torsion and cotorsion equations for @xmath373 are linear and hence determined by linear algebra . more generally , our choice of frame group and associated structures have to be chosen according to what geometry we want to model .",
    "i.e. for each choice of regular graph for the ` topology ' of the finite set , we have further choices for the actual geometry we want to model .",
    "we have already seen how this goes for a small number of points ; there are progressively more choices as the number of points increases .    also , for the quantum theory on should sum over all topological configurations , i.e. graphs and colourings , and then integrate over all moduli spaces for each colorung ( eg of the restricted variety as we have done in section  5 ) , weighted with some action such as the einstein - hilbert one . in this way",
    "one arrives in principle at a quantum gravity theory in which differential structures ( which goes into the graph ) are summed over as well as an additional variable .",
    "let us note here a remarkable duality : the sum over all coloured graphs , which is the combinatorial part of our theory , is in the spirit of a feynman diagram , i.e. in some sense the discrete quantum gravity theory is somewhat like a scalar theory in usual flat space ( with @xmath651 interaction if we look at @xmath10-regular graphs ) .",
    "if one wanted to take this further , one should sum over the number of points @xmath196 , i.e. take all finite sets with @xmath10-regular graphs or the @xmath10-dimensionality of the non - commutative manifold structures fixed .",
