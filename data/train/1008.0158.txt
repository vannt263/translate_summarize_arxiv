    "spin current , a flow of the spin angular momentum , is an important physical quantity to operate spintronic devices .",
    "@xcite the spin hall effect ( she ) is widely recognized as a phenomenon that converts charge current to the spin current requiring neither external magnetic fields nor ferromagnets .  @xcite the search for materials exhibiting large she s is therefore a prime task for further advancement of spintronic devices . since the she originates from spin - dependent scattering events , materials with large spin - orbit interactions can be good candidates for efficient generation of the spin current .",
    "it is , however , difficult to study the she s in such materials since the spin diffusion length is extremely short ( of the order of several nanometers ) .",
    "we have established the sensitive electrical detection technique of the she using the spin current absorption effect .",
    "@xcite the greatest advantage of this technique is that one can measure the she as well as the spin diffusion length of materials with large spin - orbit interactions on the same device .",
    "this enables us to obtain the sh conductivity as well as the sh angle which is defined as the ratio of sh conductivity and charge conductivity .",
    "spin - dependent hall effects have been theoretically discussed in terms of two distinct physical mechanisms .",
    "one is the extrinsic mechanism induced by the impurity scattering  @xcite that was intensively investigated a few decades ago as an origin of the anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) .",
    "@xcite the other is the intrinsic mechanism based on the band - structure effect as a manifestation of the berry phase .  @xcite it was believed that the intrinsic mechanism is limited only in very clean systems such as semiconductors with high electron mobility .",
    "@xcite recently , intrinsic ahes where spin - orbit interaction together with the interband mixing results in an intrinsic anomalous velocity in the transverse direction have been observed in many systems even at room temperature .",
    "@xcite in the case of she s in nonmagnetic materials , on the other hand , there is no hall voltage since the number of spin - up and down electrons are exactly same .",
    "however , when the _ pure _ spin current defined as the difference between the spin - up and down currents is injected into such materials , both spin - up and spin - down electrons are scattered to the same side , which can be detected as a hall voltage .",
    "interestingly , recent theoretical studies show that the magnitude and sign of sh conductivities due to the intrinsic she in 4@xmath0 and 5@xmath0 transition metals ( tms ) change systematically in response to the number of @xmath0 electrons .",
    "@xcite therefore , systematic experiments of the she s in such tms should help to find the dominant mechanism of the observed she .",
    "as described above , the most difficult point for transport measurements of the she s in 4@xmath0 and 5@xmath0 tms is their short spin diffusion lengths .",
    "the spin absorption technique which is detalied in refs .   and   enables us to perform quantitative and systematic studies of the she s even in materials with short spin diffusion lengths . in this paper",
    ", we report on measurements of the she s in various 4@xmath0 and 5@xmath0 tms using the spin absorption technique .",
    "the experimentally observed sh conductivities of those tms are semiqunatitatively consistent with the recent calculations based on the intrinsic she .",
    "this fact strongly supports that the instrinsic machanism of the she s in 4@xmath0 and 5@xmath0 tms is more dominant than the extrinsic ones .",
    "our device has been fabricated on a thermally oxidized silicon subtrate using electron beam lithography on polymethyl - methacrylate ( pmma ) resist and subsequent lift - off process .",
    "the device is based on the lateral spin valve structure  @xcite where a tm middle wire is inserted in between two permalloy ( py ) wires as shown in fig .",
    "the py wires are 30  nm in thickness ( @xmath1 ) and 100  nm in width ( @xmath2 ) and have been deposited by means of electron beam evaporation . here one py wire ( py1 ) has large pads at the edges to induce the difference in the switching field . in this work , five different tms (",
    "nb , ta , mo , pd and pt ) have been used as a middle wire .",
    "nb , ta and mo wires were deposited by magnetron sputtering while pd and pt wires were grown by electron beam evaporation .",
    "the cu strip whose thickness ( @xmath3 ) is 100  nm and whose width ( @xmath4 ) is 150  nm was fabricated by a joule heating evaporator .",
    "prior to cu evaporation , a careful ar - ion beam etching was carried out for 30 s to clean the surfaces of py and tm wires and to obtain highly transparent ohmic contacts .    when the spin - polarized current is injected from py1 into the upper side of the cu strip , there is no net charge current but only a _ pure _ spin current is induced on the bottom side of the cu strip [ see fig .",
    "the induced spin current is divided into two segments ( tm or the bottom side of cu strip ) at the junction  1 ( tm / cu junction ) . when the spin relaxation of the tm wire is much stronger than that of the cu wire , the induced spin current is preferably absorbed into the tm wire .",
    "this leads to a drastic reduction of the spin accumulation voltage in the junction  2 ( py2/cu junction ) .",
    "the flowing direction of the spin current in the tm wire is perpendicular to the plane of junction  1 because of its strong spin - orbit interaction , in other words , its short spin diffusion length .",
    "@xcite therefore , the charge accumulation due to the inverse she ( ishe ) is induced in the tm wire .",
    "the measurements have been carried out by using an ac lock - in amplifier and a he flow cryostat .",
    "the magnetic field is applied along the easy and hard axes of py for nonlocal spin valve ( nlsv )  @xcite and ishe measurements , respectively .     with and without tm wires measured at 10  k for @xmath5  nm ( upper panel ) and @xmath6  nm ( lower panel).,width=226 ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "first , we measure nlsv signals to evaluate the spin diffusion lengths of tm wires as well as the spin current absorbed into the tm middle wires precisely .  @xcite",
    "as described above , the spin accumulation signal without the tm wires @xmath7 ( @xmath8 , i.e. , the spin accumulation voltage divided by the charge current ) is reduced to @xmath9 by inserting the tm middle wires . in fig .",
    "2(b ) , we show the nlsv signals for various tm insertions .",
    "all the results exhibit clear spin absorption effects , assuring that the spin currents are really absorbed into the tm middle wires via the cu strip . from the one - dimensional spin - diffusion model proposed by takahashi and maekawa ,  @xcite",
    "the normalized spin accumulation signal @xmath10 can be calculated as follows :  @xcite @xmath11 here @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the spin resistances for cu and tm , respectively .",
    "@xcite the spin resistance for cu is defined by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 , @xmath16 are the electrical resistivity and the spin diffusion length of cu .",
    "@xcite the spin resistance for tm is defined by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are the electrical resistivity , the spin diffusion length and the width of the tm wire , respectively .",
    "the hyperbolic tangent term comes from the boundary condition where @xmath21 at the substrate , as detailed in ref .  .",
    "@xmath22 is the distance between the two py wires .",
    "since @xmath16 is already known from our previous experiments ,  @xcite @xmath19 can be calculated by using eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the spin diffusion lengths @xmath19 as well as other characteristic paprameters for various tm wires are summarized in table  [ table1 ] . in the present study",
    "@xmath19 is quite short for all the tms , supporting the strong spin - orbit interactions in the tm wires .    .",
    ", width=226 ]    next we measure ishes for the tm wires .",
    "note that the direction of the applied magnetic field in this case is parallel to the cu strip corresponding to the hard axis of the py wire as shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) . in fig .",
    "3(b ) we show the ishe signals @xmath23 measured at 10  k for various tm wires .",
    "for all the tm wires , @xmath23 linearly changes with the magnetic field below 2000  oe and saturates above 2000  oe because the magnetization of the py wire fully aligns with the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "@xmath24 defined in this paper is two times smaller than that previously reported by some of the present authors .",
    "@xcite however , we have adapted the current notation in order to have consistency with ahe measurements , other she measurements and theoretical expressions .",
    "@xcite interestingly the sign of the slope below 2000  oe depends on the tms ; the slope is negative for nb , ta , and mo , while it is positive for pd and pt .",
    "this clearly shows that the sign of the sh conductivity changes depending on the kinds of tms . a similar material dependence of the sign of sh conductivity has been reported in refs .   and  , where the spin pumping method has been used to measure ishes .",
    "electrons for 4@xmath0 ( circle ) and 5@xmath0 ( square ) tms . ,",
    "width=245 ]    according to the theory on the intrinsic she in @xmath0-electron systems ,  @xcite the sh conductivity in tms is approximately given by the following equation ; @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the lattice constant and the expectation value of the ls coupling , respectively . from the hund s third rule , @xmath27 is negative ( positive ) when the number of electrons is more ( less ) than half - filling .",
    "the experimentally observed sign change of the sh conductivities in the tm wires is well reproduced by the intrinsic she in the @xmath0-electron system .",
    "we now discuss the magnitude of the sh conductivities of the tm wires .",
    "as mentioned above , the pure spin current is absorbed perpendicularly into the tm wires .",
    "this means that the spin current has a distribution along the thickness direction , i.e. , @xmath28 because @xmath29 should varnish at the substrate .",
    "the sh conductivity can be calculated by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the effective spin current to contributes to ishe . the factor",
    "@xmath32 is a correction factor taking into account the fact that the horizontal current driven by the ishe voltage to balance the spin - orbit deflections is partially shunted by the cu wire above the tm / cu interface .",
    "@xcite the correction factor @xmath32 for each tm is derived from additional measurements of the resistance of the tm wire with and without the interface with cu .",
    "it is found to be 0.36@xmath330.08 which is not so sensitive to the resistivity whitin our resistivity range ( see supplemental material in ref .  ) .",
    "we can obtain @xmath34 from the ishe mesurements , i.e. , @xmath35 .",
    "@xcite    in our case , @xmath19 is always smaller than @xmath36 .",
    "the spin currents injected into the tm wire should be diluted in the tm wire , which leads to a smaller @xmath24 . to correct this effect , we take into account all the spin currents injected into the tm wire and then divide them by @xmath36 :  @xcite    @xmath37 + 2 r_{\\rm tm } \\sinh \\left ( l/\\lambda_{\\rm cu } \\right ) } , \\label{eq3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the spin resistance and the spin polarization of py , respectively .",
    "@xmath38 is defined as @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the electric resistivity and the spin diffusion length of py .",
    "@xcite    to compare the experimentally obtained sh conductivity with the theoretically calculated value in ref  , we plot both of them in fig .  4 .",
    "in most cases , the experimental results are quantitatively consistent with the calculated ones within a factor of 2 .",
    "this fact strongly suggests that the she s in 4@xmath0 and 5@xmath0 tms are mainly caused by the intrinsic mechanism as pointed out in ref  .",
    "of course , we can not exclude the possibility of some contributions from the extrinsic mechanisms such as the skew scattering and the side jump .",
    "however , we use a pure ( at least more than 99.9% ) source for each tm and deposit it under a pressure of @xmath43 torr .",
    "this assures that no other tms which have @xmath0-orbital degrees of freedom and cause large extrinsic she s are included , and the resistivity of the tm wire is simply caused by grain boundary , lattice mismatch , other defects and so on .",
    "we believe that the contribution from the intrinsic mechanism is more dominant in 4@xmath0 and 5@xmath0 tms than that from the extrinsic one .    in the previous works on the she in pt reported by some of the present authors ,  @xcite the mechanism of the she was the extrinsic one ( side - jump scattering ) and the sh angle ( @xmath44 ) of pt was 0.37% . in the present study ,",
    "however , we claim that the dominant mechanism of the she in pt is intrinsic one and the sh angle for pt is 2.1% , which is about 6 times larger .",
    "there are several reasons for our present conclusions ; in the previous work ,  @xcite they concluded that the side - jump mechanism was dominant because the sh resistivity is proportional to @xmath45",
    ". however , this resistivity dependence is also predicted in the intrinsic mechanism .",
    "@xcite for the sh angle of pt , the boundary condition for @xmath46 had not been taken into account appropriately in the previous study ( see eq .",
    "( 2 ) in ref .  ) . in the present study ,",
    "on the other hand , we impose @xmath21 at the bottom of the tm wires .",
    "in addition , we consider the shunting effect of the cu strip as detailed in ref .  .",
    "the resistivity of the tm wires is much larger than that of the cu strip ( @xmath47 @xmath48 cm ) .",
    "this causes a smaller current flowing the tm wires and as a result causes the underestimation of the sh angle as discussed in refs .   and  .",
    "the sh angle ( 2.1% ) of pt in the present paper is consistent with that ( 1.3% ) in ref .   and is a few times smaller than that ( 5.6% ) in ref .  .",
    "in conclusion , we have measured the sh conductivities for various tms in a lateral spin valve structure .",
    "when @xmath0 electrons are smaller ( larger ) than the half - filled value , we have observed negative ( positive ) sh conductivies .",
    "compared to the recent theoretical calculations based on the intrinsic she s in 4@xmath0 and 5@xmath0 tms , the experimentally obtained sh conducitivies are semiquantitativley consistent with the theoretical ones .",
    "this fact strongly indicates that the intrinsic mechanism based on the degeneracy of @xmath0-orbits in the ls coupling is dominant for the she s in 4@xmath0 and 5@xmath0 tms .",
