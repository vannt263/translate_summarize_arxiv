    "the study of electromagnetic ( em ) decays of hadronic states plays an important role in revealing the structure of hadrons and the mechanism of the interactions between photons and hadrons  @xcite .",
    "notably , the em dalitz decays @xmath9 of unflavored vector ( @xmath10 ) mesons ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 or @xmath1 ) are of interest for probing the em structure arising at the vertex of the transition from vector to pseudoscalar ( @xmath14 ) states . in these decays ,",
    "the lepton pair can be formed by internal conversion of an intermediate virtual photon with invariant - mass @xmath15 .",
    "assuming point - like particles , the variation of the decay rate with @xmath15 is exactly described by quantum electrodynamics ( qed )  @xcite . for physical mesons ,",
    "however , the rate will be modified by the dynamic transition form factor @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the total four - momentum of the lepton pair and @xmath18 is their invariant - mass squared .",
    "the general form for the @xmath19-dependent differential decay width for @xmath20 , normalized to the width of the corresponding radiative decay @xmath21 , is given by  @xcite    @xmath22^{3/2}\\nonumber \\\\    & = &   |f_{v p}(q^2)|^2 \\times [ \\mbox{qed}(q^2 ) ] ,   \\label{eq : dgamman}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath23 is the mass of the initial vector state , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the masses of the final states pseudoscalar meson and lepton , respectively ; @xmath26 is the fine structure constant , and @xmath27 $ ] represents the point - like qed result .",
    "the magnitude of the form factor can be estimated based on phenomenological models of nonperturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )  @xcite .",
    "for example , in the vector meson dominance ( vmd )",
    "model  @xcite , the form factor is governed mainly by the resonance interaction between photons and hadrons in the time - like region .",
    "experimentally , the form factor is directly accessible by comparing the measured invariant - mass spectrum of the lepton pairs from dalitz decays with the point - like qed prediction  @xcite . in the simple pole approximation  @xcite the @xmath19-dependent form factor",
    "is parameterized by @xmath28 where the parameter @xmath29 is the spectroscopic pole mass .",

    "these theoretical and experimental investigations of the em dalitz decays of the light vector mesons motivate us to study the rare charmonium decays @xmath35 , which should provide useful information on the interaction of the charmonium states with the electromagnetic field . at present , there is no experimental information on these decays . in ref .",
