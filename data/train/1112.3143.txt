    "as a result of gravitational lensing , large scale inhomogeneities in the matter density field produce small but systematic fluctuations in the sizes , shapes , and fluxes of distant objects that are coherent across large scales .",
    "this effect was first suggested as a tool for constraining the form of the metric in 1966 by @xcite . in a more modern context , the two - point statistics of lensing fluctuations allow the only truly direct measurement of the matter power spectrum and the growth of structure at late times , when dark energy has caused an accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite and affected the growth of structure .",
    "many studies have pointed out that high signal - to - noise cosmic shear measurements would be extraordinarily sensitive probes of cosmological parameters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which led to its being flagged as one of the most promising probes of dark energy by the dark energy task force @xcite .",
    "direct measurements of the growth of structure also offer the opportunity to test alternative models of gravity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "cosmic shear measurements were attempted as early as 1967 @xcite , but until the turn of the millennium , no astronomical survey had the statistical power to detect it .",
    "the difficulty of the measurement is a consequence of the near - homogeneity and isotropy of the universe .",
    "an order unity distortion to galaxy images requires an integrated line - of - sight matter over - density of : @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are the angular diameter distances from the observer to the background source , from the observer to the lens , and from the lens to the background source , respectively .",
    "a fluctuation in the surface density @xmath17 leads to a shear distortion @xmath18 .",
    "averaged over large ( @xmath19 100 mpc ) scales , typical line - of - sight matter fluctuations are only @xmath20 .",
    "the primary source of noise in the shear measurement , the random intrinsic dispersion in galaxy shapes , is orders of magnitude larger ; typically the shape noise results in a dispersion in the shear of @xmath21 .",
    "worse , even in modern ground - based astronomical imaging surveys , the coherent distortions  or point - spread function ( psf )  induced by effects of the atmosphere , telescope optics , and detectors are typically several times larger than the cosmological signal ( e.g. , @xcite and paper i in this series ) . estimating the distances to the background sources is both crucial @xcite and difficult @xcite ; errors there will modulate the amplitude of the signal through @xmath22 , biasing inference of the growth of structure .",
    "these obstacles define the observational problem .",
    "while the existence of cosmic shear has been established by the first studies to detect the effect , the full potential of cosmological lensing remains to be exploited .",
    "few data sets capable of achieving the signal strength for a cosmologically competitive measurement presently exist ",
    "the canada - france - hawaii telescope legacy survey ( cfhtls ; ) , the cosmological evolution survey ( cosmos ; ) , and the subset of the sdss imaging studied here .",
    "however , several large surveys are planned for the immediate and longer - term future that will substantially expand the amount of available data for cosmological weak lensing studies . in the next few years ,",
    "these include hyper suprime - cam ( hsc , @xcite ) , dark energy survey ( des , @xcite ) , the kilo - degree survey ( kids ) , and the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system ( pan - starrs , @xcite ) .",
    "further in the future , there are even more ambitious programs such as the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst , @xcite ) , euclid , and the wide - field infrared survey telescope ( wfirst ) .    for this work",
    ", we have combined several methods discussed in the literature as viable techniques for measuring cosmic shear while removing common systematic errors . in paper",
    "i @xcite , we began with the psf model generated by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) pipeline over @xmath23 deg@xmath2 that had been imaged many times , and employed a rounding kernel method similar to that proposed in @xcite .",
    "the result , after appropriate masking of problematic regions , was 168 square degrees of deep coadded imaging with a well controlled , homogeneous psf and sufficient galaxy surface density to measure a cosmic shear signal .",
    "the usable area in @xmath24 band was only 140 square degrees because of a psf model error problem on the camcol 2 charge - coupled device ( ccd ) , which is suspected to be an amplifier non - linearity problem .    in this work ,",
    "we use the catalogue from paper i to produce a cosmic shear measurement that is dominated by statistical errors .",
    "section [ sec : model ] enumerates the primary sources of systematic error when measuring cosmic shear using our catalogue ( the properties of which are summarized briefly in sec .",
    "[ sec : catalogues ] ) , and describes our approaches to constraining each of them . in section [ sec : analysis_tools ] , we outline our correlation function estimator and several transformations of it that are used for systematics tests .",
    "our methods for estimating covariance matrices for our observable quantities ( both due to statistical and systematic errors ) are described in sec .",

    "we show that in addition to its value as an independent measurement of the late - time matter power spectrum , this measurement provides some additional constraining power over wmap7 within the context of @xmath8cdm .",
    "we conclude with some lessons for the future in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .    while this work was underway , we learned of a parallel effort by lin et al .",
    "these two efforts use different methods of coaddition , different shape measurement codes , different sets of cuts for the selection of input images and galaxies , and analyze their final results in different ways ; what they have in common is their use of sdss data ( not necessarily the same sets of input imaging ) and their use of the sdss photo pipeline for the initial reduction of the single epoch data and the final reduction of the coadded data ( however , they use different versions of photo ) . using these different methods ,",
    "both groups have extracted the cosmic shear signal and its cosmological interpretations .",
    "we have coordinated submission with them but have not consulted their results prior to this , so these two analysis efforts are independent , representing versions of two independent pipelines .",
    "paper i @xcite describes a coadd imaging dataset , optimised for cosmic shear measurement , constructed from single - epoch sdss images in the stripe 82 equatorial region , with right ascension ( ra ) @xmath29ra@xmath30 , and declination @xmath31dec@xmath32 . in that work",
    ", we apply an adaptive rounding kernel to the single - epoch images to null the effects of psf anisotropy and match to a single homogeneous psf model for the entire region , and show that in the resulting shear catalogues , the amplitude of the galaxy shape correlations due to psf anisotropy at angular separations greater than 1 arcminute is negligible compared to the expected cosmic shear statistical errors .",
    "the final shape catalogue described in that work consists of 1067031 @xmath24-band and 1251285 @xmath33-band shape measurements with characteristic limiting magnitudes of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , over effective areas of 140 and 168 square degrees , respectively .",
    "we model the observed galaxy shape field as the sum of a cosmic shear component , an independent systematics field produced by anisotropies in the effective psf @xmath34 , and a systematics field produced by the intrinsic spatial correlations of galaxy shapes @xmath35 ( intrinsic alignments ; e.g. , @xcite ) . we allow for a shear calibration factor that depends on the shear responsivity @xmath36 @xcite of the ensemble of galaxy surface brightness profiles to the underlying gravitationally - induced shear @xmath37 .",
    "typically @xmath38 , however we consider it to be a more general factor that also includes any biases due to effects such as uncorrected psf dilution , noise - related biases , or selection biases .",
    "we assume that the galaxy shape response to psf anisotropies @xmath39 is not _ a priori _ known , but rather suffers from a similar set of ` calibration ' uncertainties as the response of the ensemble of galaxy images to gravitational lensing shear .",
    "thus we define our model for the two ellipticity components @xmath40 as @xmath41    we assume that the two - point statistics of the underlying ( cosmological ) shear field @xmath42 consist entirely of @xmath43-modes , @xmath44 ( which is a good enough approximation given the size of our errors ; ) , and are statistically independent of the psf when averaged over large regions .",
    "we also assume that the psf and the intrinsic alignments are independent  but not that the lensing shear and intrinsic alignments are independent @xcite .",
    "the two - point correlation of the galaxy shapes contains terms resulting from gravitational lensing and from systematic errors : @xmath45 here , @xmath46 is the auto - correlation of the psf ellipticity field .",
    "errors in the determination of the galaxy redshift distribution will enter as a bias in the predicted @xmath47 .",
    "our goal is to carry out a statistics - limited measurement of @xmath47 .",
    "this will entail showing that the combined amplitudes of @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , the uncertainty in the theoretically - predicted @xmath47 arising from redshift errors , and the uncertainty in the shear calibration ( via the responsivity @xmath36 ) contribute less than @xmath51 per cent to the statistical errors in @xmath52 .",
    "our approach to handling of systematic error is as follows : we attempt to reduce each systematic to a term that can be robustly and believably estimated from real data ( either the data here or in other , related work ) , and we then explicitly correct for it .",
    "these corrections naturally have some uncertainty associated with them , which we use to derive a systematic error component to the covariance matrix .",
    "the exception to the rule given here is if there is a systematic error for which there is no clear path to estimating its magnitude , then we do not attempt any correction , and simply marginalize over it by include an associated uncertainty in the covariance matrix .",
    "foreground anisotropies in the matter distribution along the line of sight to a galaxy will generically distort the galaxy image .",
    "for weak lensing , the leading order lensing contribution to galaxy shapes can be thought of as arising from a linear transformation of the image coordinates @xmath53 , where @xmath54    the convergence @xmath55 causes magnification , whereas the shear components @xmath56 and @xmath57 map circles to ellipses .",
    "the shear is related to the projected line - of - sight matter distribution , weighted by the lensing efficiency : @xmath58 here we integrate along the comoving line - of - sight distance @xmath59 ( where @xmath60 is the distance to the source ) , and the matter over - density @xmath61 . the window function in a flat universe",
    "is @xmath62    the two - point correlation function of the shear can be calculated by identifying pairs of source galaxies , and defining shear components @xmath63 for each one to be the shear in the coordinate system defined by the vector connecting them , and in the @xmath64 rotated system .",
    "this two - point correlation function can be expressed as a linear transformation of the matter power spectrum @xmath65 averaged over the line of sight to the sheared galaxies : @xmath66 and @xmath67 ^ 2 , \\label{eq : pkappa } \\label{eqn : shear_xi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the last expression makes use of limber s approximation and @xmath68 is the distance function , i.e. @xmath59 in a flat universe , @xmath69 in a closed universe , and @xmath70 in an open universe . in the expression in brackets , @xmath71 represents the source distribution as a function of line - of - sight distance ( normalised to integrate to 1 ) .",
    "this statistic ( @xmath72 ) is sensitive both to the distribution of matter @xmath73 and to the background cosmology , via both the explicit @xmath74 dependence and the distance - redshift relations .",
    "many studies have discussed intrinsic alignments of galaxy shapes due to effects such as angular momentum alignments or tidal torque due to the large - scale density field ( for pioneering studies , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while these effects can generate coherent intrinsic alignment 2-point functions , @xcite pointed out that the large - scale tidal fields that can cause intrinsic alignments are sourced by the same large - scale structure that is responsible for producing a cosmic shear signal .",
    "thus , in this model , the intrinsic alignments do not just have a nonzero auto - correlation , they also have a significant anti - correlation with the lensing shear which can persist to very large transverse scales and line - of - sight separations .",
    "if left uncorrected , this coherent alignment of intrinsic galaxy shapes suppresses the lensing signal , since the response of the intrinsic shape to an applied tidal field has the opposite sign from the response of the galaxy image to a shear with the same magnitude and direction .",
    "we generally refer to the intrinsic alignment auto - correlation as the `` @xmath75 '' contamination and its correlation with gravitational lensing as the `` @xmath76 '' contamination .",
    "this can be compared to the pure gravitational lensing auto - correlation ( `` @xmath77 '' ) .    to address the uncertainty related to intrinsic alignments , we rely on empirical measurements that constrain the degree to which they might affect our measurement . several studies using sdss imaging and",
    "spectroscopic data have demonstrated the existence of intrinsic alignments of galaxy shapes on cosmological distance scales .",
    "@xcite used the luminosity and colour - dependence of intrinsic alignments for several sdss galaxy samples to estimate the contamination of the cosmic shear signal due intrinsic alignments for lensing surveys as a function of their depth .",
    "these estimates were a function of the assumptions that were made , for example about evolution with redshift .",
    "the `` central '' model given in that paper leads to a fractional contamination of @xmath78 for a limiting magnitude of @xmath79 , which is close to the limiting magnitude of our sample .",
    "subsequent work provided more information about redshift evolution ; primarily those results were in broad agreement with the previous ones , and were sufficient to rule out both the `` optimistic '' and the `` very pessimistic '' models in @xcite .",
    "we thus adopt the `` central '' model , and apply the correction given in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : gi_signal ] ) to our theory predictions for the @xmath80 due to cosmic shear , multiplying the predicted cosmic shear power spectrum by @xmath81 before transforming into the statistics that are used for the actual cosmological constraints .",
    "we also assume this correction has a conservative systematic uncertainty of 50 per cent , which amounts to an overall 4 per cent uncertainty in the theory prediction ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : allcov ] for a quantitative description of how we incorporate this and other systematic uncertainties into the covariance matrix ) .",
    "since the @xmath76 correlation is first order in the intrinsic alignment amplitude , while the @xmath75 power is second order , we expect the first to be the dominant systematic . in principle",
    ", the @xmath76 effect could be smaller than @xmath75 if the correct alignment model is quadratic in the tidal field rather than linear @xcite . however , in the aforementioned cases in which intrinsic alignment signals are detected at high significance ( i.e. for bright ellipticals ) the linear model for intrinsic alignments appears to be valid @xcite .",
    "therefore we attempt no correction for @xmath75 .",
    "another source of systematic error for weak lensing measurements is uncertainty in the _ shear calibration _ factor .",
    "the galaxy ellipticity @xmath82 observed after isotropizing the psf need not have unit response to shear : in general , averaged over a population of sheared galaxies , we should have @xmath83 where @xmath36 is the shear responsivity .",
    "it depends on both the shape measurement method _ and _ the galaxy population ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for this work",
    ", we used the re - gaussianization method @xcite , which is based on second moments from fits to elliptical gaussians , and has been previously applied to sdss single - epoch imaging @xcite . for this class of methods , in the absence of selection biases and weighting of the galaxies , perfectly homologous isophotes , and no noise , there is an analytic expectation @xcite : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the root - mean - square ellipticity per component ( @xmath86 or @xmath87 ) .",
    "the calibration errors for re - gaussianization and other adaptive - weighting methods are well - studied in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they arise from all of the deviations from the assumptions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : perfectcal ] ) .",
    "higher - order departures from non - gaussianity in the galaxy light profile cause errors in the psf dilution correction .",
    "errors in the measurement of the psf model will cause a similar error in the dilution correction .",
    "the resolution factor of an individual galaxy depends on its ellipticity , so any resolution cut on the galaxy sample will introduce a shear bias in the galaxy selection function . due to the non - linearity of the shear inference procedure , noise in the galaxy images",
    "causes a bias in the shears ( rather than just making them noisier ) .",
    "the estimation of the shear responsivity , or even of @xmath85 , is another potential source of error , as the response of the galaxies to the shear depends on the true , intrinsic shapes , rather than the gravitationally sheared , smeared ( by the psf ) , noisy ones that we observe .",
    "past approaches to this problem have included detailed accounting for these effects one by one . in this paper",
    ", we instead use detailed simulations of the image processing and shape measurement pipelines , including real galaxy images , to estimate both the shear calibration and the redshift distribution of our catalogue .",
    "the advantage is that this includes all of the above effects and avoids uncertainties associated with analytic estimates of errors .",
    "the shera ( shear reconvolution analysis ) simulation package has been previously described @xcite and applied to single - epoch sdss data for galaxy - galaxy lensing @xcite , but this is its first application to cosmic shear data .",
    "to simulate our images , we require a fair , flux - limited sample of any galaxies that could plausibly be resolved in our coadd imaging , including high - resolution images with realistic morphologies . for this purpose",
    "we use a sample of 56662 galaxy images drawn from the cosmological evolution survey ( cosmos : * ? ? ?",

    "these images consist of two samples  a `` bright '' sample of 26116 galaxies in the magnitude range @xmath90 , and a `` faint '' sample consisting of the @xmath91 galaxies .",

    "the bright sample is used for ground - based image simulations in @xcite ; the faint sample is selected and processed in an identical way .",
    "each postage stamp is assigned a weight to account for the relative likelihoods of generating postage stamps passing all cuts ( avoidance of ccd edges and bright stars ) for galaxies of different sizes in the cosmos field ; this weight is calculated empirically , by comparing the size distribution of galaxies with postage stamps to the size distribution of a purely flux - limited sample of galaxies .",
    "each of these postage - stamp images has several properties associated with it that are of interest for this analysis .",
    "the cosmos photometric catalogues @xcite contain hst @xmath88 magnitudes as well as photometric redshifts and subaru @xmath92 colours based on psf - matched aperture magnitudes .    in order to simulate our observations ,",
    "we first select a coadd ` run ' consisting of five adjacent frames in the scan direction at random from the list of completed runs .",
    "we draw 1250  galaxies ( exactly 250 per frame ) at random from the list of cosmos postage stamps according to the weights described above , up - weighting the probability of drawing the faint galaxies by a factor of 1.106  to account for the fact that we have sampled the faint population at a lower rate than the bright one in constructing the image sample .",
    "once a list of postage - stamp images is selected , we assign @xmath24- and @xmath33-band magnitudes by re - scaling each image ; each galaxy image is inserted into the coadded imaging with the flux it would have been observed to have in sdss before the addition of pixel noise . the @xmath33-band is chosen to be @xmath93 magnitudes brighter than the cosmos @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) band mag_auto values ; this small offset is based on empirical comparison with sdss magnitudes for brighter galaxies , to account for slight differences in the @xmath88 and @xmath33 passbands @xcite .",
    "the @xmath24-band is chosen so as to match the subaru psf - matched aperture colours for each object .",
    "each postage stamp is assigned a random , uniformly - sampled position in the coadd run , with the postage stamps distributed equally among the frames .",
    "we use the shera code to pseudo - deconvolve the hst point - spread function , apply ( if necessary ; see below ) a shear to each galaxy , reconvolve each image with the known coadd point - spread function , renormalise the flux appropriately , and resample from the cosmos pixel scale to the coadd pixel scale before adding that postage stamp to the coadd image .",
    "this procedure , suggested by @xcite and implemented to high precision in @xcite , can be used to simulate ground - based images with a shear appropriately applied , despite the space - based psf in the original cosmos images , and with a user - defined psf .",

    "our measurement provides some additional constraints beyond those from wmap7 on these parameters .",
    "in particular , the low amplitude of the measured shear signal rules out some of the previously allowed volume of @xmath260 and @xmath4 wmap7 constraints .",
    "using coadded imaging constructed from sdss stripe 82 data , we constructed a weak lensing catalogue of 1328885 galaxies covering 168 square degrees ( paper i ) , and showed that the additive shear systematics arising from the psf are negligible compared to the cosmic shear signal . in this paper , we carried out a cosmic shear measurement that resulted in a 20  per cent constraint on @xmath4 ( with all other cosmological parameters fixed ) .",
    "this adds constraining power beyond that from wmap7 , and serves as an important independent data point on the amplitude of the matter power spectrum at late times . in particular , the primary cmb anisotropies presently provide only a modest constraint on @xmath241 , and ( due to the effect of matter density on the growth of structure ) there is then an elongated allowed region in the @xmath261 plane ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : lcdmconstraints ] . the wmap7-allowed region is ideally oriented for lensing to play a role : the lensing signal at the high-@xmath241 , high-@xmath4 end of the ellipse leads to a much higher lensing signal than low @xmath241 , low @xmath4 .",
    "the low amplitude of cosmic shear observed in this paper eliminates the high-@xmath241 , high-@xmath4 solutions , and leads to a wmap7+sdss lensing solution of @xmath9(1@xmath6)@xmath10(2@xmath6 ) and @xmath11(1@xmath6)@xmath262(2@xmath6 ) ; the 2@xmath6 error ranges are respectively 14  and 17  per cent smaller than for wmap7 alone .",
    "we have also carefully evaluated other sources of uncertainty such as the source redshift distribution , intrinsic alignments , and shear calibration , to ensure that our measurement is dominated by statistical errors rather than systematic errors .",
    "this achievement is important when considering that ( i ) the sdss data were never designed with this application in mind , and indeed includes several features ( e.g. the minimal amount of cross - scan dithering ) that cause significant difficulty , and ( ii ) with the multitude of upcoming multi - exposure lensing surveys in the next few years , it is important to cultivate new data analysis techniques ( such as the one used here ) that are capable of producing homogeneous data with tight control over psf anisotropies . as a quantitative measure of the extent of psf correction possible with sdss data , we take the rms residual spurious shear at a particular scale estimated from the star - galaxy correlations , @xmath263 from fig .

    "there is almost no difference between the @xmath269 and @xmath270 signals , suggesting that the spurious additive ellipticity signal contains similar amounts of @xmath43- and @xmath145-modes and @xmath271 are @xmath272 hankel transforms of each other .",
    "] ; something similar was seen in the sdss single - epoch data via run - by - run comparisons of ellipticity measurements on the same galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "this is good news for the use of the @xmath145-mode as a diagnostic of psf systematics , although an understanding of the generality of this pattern remains elusive .",
    "a major lesson learned from this project is the importance of _ masking bias _ , in which the intrinsic orientation of a galaxy affects whether it falls within the survey mask .",
    "this is likely the main reason why we had to implement the @xmath132 projection .",
    "while we have clearly not exhausted the range of options for removing this bias at the catalogue level , future surveys should be designed to produce more uniform data quality via an appropriate dithering strategy and suppress the masking bias at the earliest stages of the analysis .",
    "our major limitation in the end was the source number density , which was driven by the fact that our psf - matching procedure was limited by the worst seeing in the images that we use , and therefore we had to eliminate the images with seeing worse than the median .",
    "this means that the coadds were not as deep as they could have been , and the final effective seeing was 1.31 arcsec ( full - width half maximum ) . in principle",
    "this will be an obstacle to applying this technique in the future , but in fact , that statement depends on context .",
    "for example , for a survey such as hsc or lsst where we expect typically @xmath273 arcsec seeing , and with plans to preferentially use the best - seeing nights for @xmath24 and @xmath33-band imaging that will be used for shape measurement , it is conceivable that nearly all images intended for lensing will have seeing in the 0.60.8 arcsec range . in that context ,",
    "a psf - matched coadd that has the rounding kernel applied may actually not result in much loss of information about the shapes of most useful galaxies , and will have the advantage of the removal of psf anisotropies .",
    "moreover , even for surveys for which the loss of information that results from this method may not be suitable for the final cosmological analysis , this method may still serve as a useful diagnostic of the additive psf systematics .",

    "<S> statistical weak lensing by large - scale structure  cosmic shear  is a promising cosmological tool , which has motivated the design of several large upcoming surveys . here </S>",
    "<S> , we present a measurement of cosmic shear using coadded sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) imaging in 168 square degrees of the equatorial region , with @xmath0 and @xmath1 , a source number density of 2.2 per arcmin@xmath2 and median redshift of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> these coadds were generated using a new method described in the companion paper i @xcite that was intended to minimise systematic errors in the lensing measurement due to coherent psf anisotropies that are otherwise prevalent in the sdss imaging data . </S>",
    "<S> we present measurements of cosmic shear out to angular separations of 2 degrees , along with systematics tests that ( combined with those from paper i on the catalogue generation ) demonstrate that our results are dominated by statistical rather than systematic errors . assuming a cosmological model corresponding to wmap7 @xcite and allowing only the amplitude of matter fluctuations @xmath4 to vary </S>",
    "<S> , we find a best - fit value of @xmath5 ( 1@xmath6 ) ; without systematic errors this would be @xmath7 ( 1@xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> assuming a flat @xmath8cdm model , the combined constraints with wmap7 are @xmath9(1@xmath6)@xmath10(2@xmath6 ) and @xmath11(1@xmath6)@xmath12(2@xmath6 ) ; the 2@xmath6 error ranges are respectively 14  and 17  per cent smaller than wmap7 alone . aside from the intrinsic value of such cosmological constraints from the growth of structure , we identify some important lessons for upcoming surveys that may face similar issues when combining multi - epoch data to measure cosmic shear .    </S>",
