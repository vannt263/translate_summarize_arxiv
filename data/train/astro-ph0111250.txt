    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is the cleanest window on the origin of structure in the very early universe .",
    "a complete description of the statistical properties of cosmological fluctuations at a redshift @xmath1 affords us an essential insight into those processes which may have seeded the formation of galaxies . in a gaussian theory of structure formation , such as the currently favored model of inflation",
    ", the power spectrum contains all the possible information about the fluctuations .",
    "any higher order moment can subsequently be described in terms of it . however , if the theory is non - gaussian ( as expected for structure formation theories due to local effects from primordial phase transitions or more generally from non - linear processes ) , then there will be deviations from the simple gaussian expressions for the higher order moments .",
    "such behavior can serve as a powerful discriminator between different models of structure formation .",
    "most analyses of cmb data to - date have focused on the angular power spectrum and its sensitivity to various parameters of cosmological theories .",
    "some work has been done on the estimation of the three point correlation function and its analogue in spherical harmonic space , with intriguing results ( heavens 1998 , ferreira , magueijo and grski 1998 , magueijo 2000 , banday , zaroubi and grski 2000 ) .",
    "it is the purpose of this letter to propose a method for estimating the four point spectrum , the _ trispectrum _ , and to apply it to the @xmath0 4 year dmr data .",
    "this work complements the recent work of hu ( 2001 ) where some of the properties of the angular trispectrum of the cmb are discussed .",
    "the outline of this letter is as follows . in section [ est ]",
    "we construct a set of orthonormal estimators and describe their properties for a gaussian random field . in section [ res ]",
    "we apply the estimators to the @xmath0 4 year dmr data .",
    "we show that we detect the non - gaussian signal found in ferreira , magueijo @xmath2 grski ( 1998 ) and that it can be explained by the arguments presented in banday , zaroubi & grski ( 2000 ) , and in particular that this is a manifestation of a known systematic effect .",
    "we therefore conclude that the @xmath0 4 year data is consistent with a gaussian cosmological signal . in section [ dis ]",
    "we summarize our results .",
    "in this section we wish to construct a set of quantities for estimating the trispectrum of a random field on the sphere .",
    "the temperature anisotropy in a given direction on the celestial sphere , @xmath3 , can be expanded in terms of spherical harmonic functions , @xmath4 : @xmath5 for any theory of structure formation , the @xmath6 coefficients are a set of random variables ; we shall restrict ourselves to theories which are statistically homogeneous and isotropic . in this case",
    "we can define the power spectrum @xmath7 of the temperature anisotropies by @xmath8 .    we now seek to construct a set of tensors that are geometrically independent , describe their statistical properties for a gaussian random field and then discuss the practical issue of their implementation .",
    "given a set of @xmath6 we wish to find the index structure of the set of four point correlators such that ( 1 ) they are rotationally invariant ( 2 ) they form a complete basis ( preferably orthonormal ) of the whole space of admissible four - point correlators and ( 3 ) they satisfy the appropriate symmetries under interchanges of @xmath9- and @xmath10-values .",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to the case in which @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , throughout this section we keep @xmath10 fixed .",
    "we determine the tensor @xmath12 such that @xmath13 where @xmath14=@xmath15 ( due to reflection , permutation and rotational symmetry ) .",
    "the @xmath16 values are then the components of the trispectrum which we wish to estimate .",
    "the explicit form of the @xmath12 are @xmath17 where the matrices in parentheses are the wigner 3-j symbols .",
    "the @xmath18 are not orthogonal and satisfy @xmath19 ( where summation over the @xmath20 is assumed ) which has rank @xmath21 .",
    "the matrix @xmath22 in ( [ llmatrix ] ) is a rectangular matrix ( with a triangular sub - block ) with @xmath21 columns and @xmath23 rows .",
    "it is constructed through a gram - schmidt procedure by subtracting for each @xmath24 ( starting from @xmath25 ) the projection onto all @xmath26 and then normalizing the result . the @xmath25 ( and hence @xmath27 ) tensor is proportional to the gaussian contribution .",
    "this can be easily seen given that for @xmath25 the wigner 3j symbols are simply kronecker @xmath28 symbols in the corresponding indices .",
    "the remaining @xmath29 terms contain therefore no gaussian signal and quantify the non - gaussian part of the trispectrum .",
    "the @xmath12 are orthonormal and can be used to construct an estimator for @xmath30 from a realization of @xmath6 : @xmath31 for a gaussian random field we expect @xmath32\\gg\\sigma^2[{\\hat t}_{\\ell;a}]$ ] for @xmath29 , where @xmath33 $ ] denotes the variance of the random variable @xmath34 and @xmath35 is simply the square of the minimum variance estimator of the @xmath7 .",
    "one finds that @xmath36 and @xmath37= 24 c_\\ell^4 $ ] for all @xmath29 .    to show that the @xmath38 constitute a family of minimum variance estimators we construct a linear combination of the estimators : @xmath39 and minimize the function @xmath40=\\langle({\\cal t}^{\\ell}_{m_1m_2m_3m_4}a_{\\ell m_1 } a_{\\ell m_2 } a_{\\ell m_3 } a_{\\ell m_4})^2\\rangle \\nonumber \\\\",
    "-\\langle{\\cal t}^{\\ell}_{m_1m_2m_3m_4}a_{\\ell m_1 }   a_{\\ell m_2 } a_{\\ell m_3 } a_{\\ell m_4}\\rangle^2 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "-\\lambda c^2_\\ell ( { \\cal t}^{\\ell}_{m_1m_2m_3m_4 } { \\cal t}^{\\ell}_{m_1m_2m_3m_4}-1)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where summation over all @xmath20 is implied .",
    "the last term , a lagrange multiplier , ensures that @xmath41 is normalized .",
    "we solve @xmath42=\\partial_\\lambda \\sigma^2_\\ell[c_a,\\lambda]=0 $ ] to find a set of two equations @xmath43 where @xmath44 this is an eigenvector equation where , for a given eigenvector @xmath45 , the eigenvalue @xmath46 will give the expected variance of the estimator . of the @xmath21 eigenvalues ,",
    "one is large and has an eigenvector proportional to @xmath35 .",
    "the remaining eigenvalues have an amplitude @xmath47 and each eigenvector is a @xmath38 for @xmath29 .",
    "note that we can relate our parameterization to the one proposed in hu ( 2001 ) ; if we reexpress equation ( [ 4mom ] ) as @xmath48 where @xmath49 then @xmath50 as defined in equation 15 of hu ( 2001 ) can be written as @xmath51    the numerical implementation of these estimators is more involved than for the bispectrum .",
    "if we omit the numerous symmetries , we have to consider for each @xmath10 a set of up to @xmath52 wigner 3j symbols ( compared to just one for the bispectrum ) .",
    "there are reasonably fast ways for constructing the wigner 3j symbols ( schulten and gordon 1976 ) but the number of operations per estimator scales as @xmath53 . for repeated computations of the estimators ( eg . in monte carlo studies ) , this can partially be avoided by storing the precomputed estimators in a lookup table , with the amount of memory required scaling as @xmath54 .",
    "clearly , to be able to estimate the trispectrum on small angular scales , approximate methods must be developed to make the procedure computationally feasible .",
    "however , the ability to constrain non - gaussianity on large angular scales is in any case more important physically for two reasons ; the ratio of the non - gaussian to the gaussian signal will in general be higher for lower moments , and the signal to noise is better for low @xmath55 . to understand these points ,",
    "let us assume a source for non - gaussianity which leads to approximately scale invariant moments of the gravitational potential on arbitrary scales .",
    "i.e. @xmath56 is constant for any @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the gravitational potential within a ball of radius @xmath57 and @xmath59 denotes the ensemble average .",
    "this might be expected from a primordial source with no preferred scale such as inflation ( komatsu & spergel 2000 ) or from an active source where the only scale is set by the horizon today ( durrer _ et al _ 2000 ) .",
    "current observations of the cmb certainly favor such scale - invariant descriptions of the potential .",
    "one then expects the moment of order @xmath60 of the @xmath6 to scale as @xmath61 .",
    "this signal will be competing against the fluctuations due to the disconnected ( or gaussian ) part , which is proportional to @xmath62 , the former therefore dominating for @xmath63 .",
    "since the power spectrum for white noise has constant amplitude , the signal to noise as a function of scale will have the same form as the scale invariant power spectrum itself , therefore being larger for smaller @xmath55 , ie .",
    "larger angular scales .",
    "as an application of the formalism described in section [ est ] , we estimate the trispectrum of the coadded 53 and 90 ghz @xmath0-dmr 4 year sky maps in healpix format ( grski _ et al _ 1999 ) .",
    "the resolution of the maps is @xmath64 or @xmath65 pixels .",
    "we do not extend our analysis beyond @xmath66 since the signal to noise is poor for higher @xmath55 .",
    "hence the maximal number of independent non - gaussian estimators for the trispectrum is @xmath67 .",
    "we set the pixels in the extended galactic cut ( banday _ et al _ 1997 ) to zero and subtract the residual monopole and dipole of the resulting map .",
    "after convolving the maps with spherical harmonics to extract a set of @xmath68 s for @xmath69 we then apply equation ( [ tnull ] ) . to validate our software ,",
    "we have estimated the bispectrum of the @xmath0-dmr 4 year sky data repixelized in the healpix format ( for convenience denoted by ec ) and reproduced the results of ferreira , magueijo & grski ( 1998 ) , and in particular the strong non - gaussian signal present at @xmath70 . when an equivalent map , from which that part of the dmr time stream contaminated by the ` eclipse effect spacecraft repeatedly flew through the earth s shadow . ] ' is removed ( denoted nec ) , is subsequently analyzed we also reproduce the results of banday , zaroubi & grski 2000 , namely that the non - gaussian signal is no longer detected . for our subsequent analysis we will present the trispectra of _ both _ the ec and nec data .",
    "one of our primary concerns is to compare our results with the assumption that the cmb sky measured by @xmath0-dmr is gaussian .",
    "to do so , we generate 10000 full - sky maps at the same resolution using a scale invariant power spectrum normalized to @xmath71k ( grski _ et al _ 1998 ) .",
    "we convolve each map with the dmr beam and add uncorrelated pixel noise with rms amplitude @xmath72 , ( where @xmath73 is the number of times a given pixel was observed ) ; we then subject the synthetic map to the same procedure as the original data .",
    "0.1 cm fig .",
    "1. the six estimators of the normalized trispectrum applied to the ec data ( circles ) and the nec data ( crosses ) .",
    "95% of all simulated gaussian skies lie within the solid lines .",
    "although removing the ` eclipse ' data changes the noise properties , we find that the gaussian confidence limits essentially remain unchanged .",
    "[ fig2 ] 0.25 cm figure 1 shows the trispectra of the dmr data together with gaussian 95% confidence limits . instead of the `` raw '' estimator ( [ tnull ] ) we prefer to use the normalized trispectrum , @xmath74 for @xmath75 ( where @xmath76 ) , thus effectively removing the dependence on the power spectrum .",
    "this prevents fluctuations in the power spectrum from introducing spurious signals and from masking real non - gaussianities .",
    "figure 1 shows that in this case , most values fall within the @xmath77 confidence lines and demonstrate the scatter expected for a gaussian random field .    of particular interest is the value of the normalized @xmath78 at @xmath70 in figure 1 .",
    "one finds that @xmath79 of the gaussian models in the ec case have a smaller @xmath78 than the measured one .",
    "this is clearly a manifestation of the non - gaussianity found in ferreira , magueijo & grski ( 1998 ) which is highly localized in @xmath10 space .",
    "however , if we estimate @xmath78 for the nec we find that it falls comfortably within the @xmath77 confidence limits .",
    "this leads us to believe that this detection of non - gaussianity results from the ` eclipse effect ' , consistent with the hypothesis of banday , zaroubi & grski ( 1999 )",
    ".    0.1 cm fig .",
    "2. the @xmath80 distribution of the gaussian models ( histogram ) and the actual data value ( dotted line ) for the ec ( top graphs ) and nec ( bottom graphs ) datasets .",
    "the left two graphs show @xmath78 which contains the main contribution to the non - gaussian signal and the right graphs show the total @xmath80 over all six non - gaussian estimators , @xmath81 to @xmath82 .",
    "[ fig3 ] 0.25 cm    let us now construct a goodness of fit for our statistic . in ferreira , magueijo & grski ( 1998 ) ,",
    "a modified @xmath80 was constructed which took into account the non - gaussian distribution of each method : as above , the distribution of each estimator for a gaussian sky was constructed and used as an approximate likelihood function to evaluate the goodness of fit .",
    "one shortcoming of such a method was that correlations between the estimates for different @xmath10s were discarded . to include them",
    ", we use the gaussian ensemble of data sets to derive the expectation values @xmath83 and the covariance matrix @xmath84 for both the power spectrum , @xmath7 , and all seven trispectrum estimators , @xmath85 to @xmath86 .",
    "we proceed to calculate the @xmath80 value for the estimator @xmath87 and the data set @xmath88 , @xmath89 \\equiv \\sum_{\\ell,\\ell ' } \\left(\\left < { { \\mathcal{e}}}_\\ell \\right>_{\\mathrm{g } } - { { \\mathcal{e}}}[{{\\mathcal{d}}}]_\\ell\\right ) c^{-1}_{\\ell\\ell ' } \\left(\\left < { { \\mathcal{e}}}_{\\ell ' } \\right>_{\\mathrm{g } } - { { \\mathcal{e}}}[{{\\mathcal{d}}}]_{\\ell'}\\right ) , \\ ] ] using as data sets the ec data and the nec data .",
    "finally we use another 10000 gaussian realizations to estimate the expected distribution of the @xmath80 for both the ec and the nec data .    for all normalized non - gaussian trispectrum estimators ( @xmath81 to @xmath82 )",
    "we find that 94% of the gaussian models have a smaller @xmath80 than the ec data as can be seen in figure 2 .",
    "as expected the main contribution to the @xmath80 for the ec data stems from @xmath78 at @xmath90 ; indeed , this is the only normalized trispectrum estimator which exhibits any significant non - gaussianity , in this case at about 99.9% .",
    "if we use the nec data , the detection vanishes . in this case",
    ", 60% of all gaussian models have a lower @xmath80 when computed over all six trispectrum estimators ( 83% for @xmath78 alone ) .",
    "hence the nec data is compatible with gaussianity .",
    "in this paper , we have derived an estimator for the trispectrum of a scalar random field on the sphere .",
    "application of this estimator , normalized by the power spectrum ( a procedure adopted in ferreira , magueijo & grski , 1998 for the bispectrum , see also komatsu _ et al _ 2002 for a detailed discussion ) , to the @xmath0-dmr data provides evidence for non - gaussianity at the 94% confidence level . as in the case of the bispectrum , the signal is mainly present in the @xmath70 multipole ( and the @xmath78 estimator here ) .",
    "however , when data is excluded to correct for the ` eclipse effect ' , the non - gaussian behavior is removed , allowing us to conclude that the non - gaussianity present in the uncorrected sky maps is not cosmological in origin .",
    "the detection of a signal that is so strongly localized in @xmath10 space provides convincing support to our contention that the trispectrum is an important and sensitive probe of non - gaussianity in the frequency ( scale ) domain .",
    "it affords complementary information to the bispectrum since it is an even moment , and , despite the higher computational effort required , has the obvious advantage in that it can probe all values of @xmath10 , not just the even ones .",
    "interestingly enough , from a theoretical perspective , there may be some possible sources of non - gaussianity for which the trispectrum provides a far more sensitive test than the bispectrum . in many cases a given moment of the @xmath6s",
    "can be expressed as the projection of a cosmological field .",
    "if that field is vector - like in nature ( as in the case of the doppler effect or the ostriker - vishniac effect and its non - linear extensions ) , any odd moment may suffer from the sunyaev - kaiser cancellation , where the integral of a given wavenumber , @xmath91 , over a smoothly varying projection function with width @xmath92 tends to suppress the moment by a factor of order @xmath93 ( sunyaev 1978 , kaiser 1985 , scannapieco 2000 ) .",
    "for even moments one can always construct a scalar component which will not be subject to this cancellation .",
    "such a tool will be of great use in the analysis of the data sets from the map and planck surveyor satellites .",
