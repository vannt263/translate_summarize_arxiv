    "black hole x - ray binaries have been studied since the early 1970s .",
    "it is now well established that the x - ray spectral and variability properties of these sources are strongly correlated , which is most clearly seen in the transient black hole x - ray binaries ( bhts ) . while there is a great variety in the observed outburst behavior of bhts ( even for single sources ) , their outbursts typically proceed along q-shaped tracks in hardness - intensity diagrams ( hids",
    "; see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) , which are traced out in an anti - clockwise manner ; we note that similar tracks are also traced out by neutron star transients ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the various branches of these tracks correspond to distinct spectral states .",
    "not all sources show all possible states and the time they spend in each state can differ significantly .",
    "there are various conventions for describing the spectral ( and variability ) states of bhts ; see , e.g. , reviews by @xcite , @xcite . in this paper",
    "we follow the convention used in @xcite , which is based on the work by @xcite on gx 339 - 4 .",
    "this source is often used as a template for the outburst evolution of bhts , owing to its well defined q - shaped hid tracks , and the fact that it shows behavior that is common to many other systems .",
    "when gx 339 - 4 goes into outburst , its intensity is low and spectrum is hard ( low - hard state or lhs ) .",
    "as the intensity increases , the spectrum remains hard , until the source makes a transition to the intermediate state ( ims ) , where the hard color starts to decrease at a rather constant intensity .",
    "the ims can be divided into a hard and a soft ims ( hims and sims , respectively ) depending on the spectral and variability characteristics observed .",
    "the transition from the lhs is always first to the hims .",
    "gx 339 - 4 often shows several transitions between hims and sims until the hardness decreases even further and the source reaches the so called high - soft state ( hss ) , where subsequently the hardness remains approximately constant as the intensity eventually decreases . at some point during this decrease hardness",
    "increases again and the source transits from the hss via the ims back to the lhs , and returns to quiescence .",
    "a bht exhibits various types of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) and broad - band noise components , whose properties are strongly correlated with spectral state ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the power spectrum of the lhs is characterized by strong broadband variability ( 0.01 - 100 hz fractional rms amplitude up to 50% ) . during the hims so - called type - c qpos",
    "are observed ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for qpo type definitions ) , often with strong harmonic content and accompanied by strong broadband variability ( fractional rms up to 30% ) . in the sims various types of variability are observed : power spectra with type - b qpos ( also with strong harmonic content ) or ( weaker ) type - a qpos , but also power spectra with weak peaked noise and/or qpo features that have been poorly characterized .",
    "all sims power spectra have in common that their broadband variability is ( considerably ) weaker than in the lhs and hims .",
    "type - c qpos are typically observed between 0.110 hz , whereas type a and b qpos are generally confined to the 48 hz range . in the hss variability",
    "reaches its minimum strength ( a few percent rms ) ; sometimes very weak qpos above 10 hz are seen @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a study of _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _ observations of maxi j1659152 ( henceforth j1659 ) .",
    "this source was discovered with the _ swift _ burst alert telescope ( bat ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on september 25 , 2010 and was initially thought to be a gamma - ray burst ( grb 100925a , see * ? ? ?",
    "later , it was suggested by @xcite to be a new galactic x - ray transient due to its persistent x - ray emission ; this was confirmed by @xcite with _ maxi _ observations .",
    "j1659 has also been detected in the radio @xcite , optical @xcite and sub - mm bands @xcite .",
    "the aim of this letter is to discuss the results of the aperiodic timing analysis and color evolution from _ rxte _ observations , based on which we conclude that j1659 is a black hole candidate @xcite .",
    "we analyzed all 65 _ rxte _ proportional counter array ( pca * ? ? ? * ) observations of j1659 taken between september 28 , 2010 ( mjd 55467 ) and november 8 , 2010 ( mjd 55508 ) , after which the source was not observed due to solar viewing constraints .",
    "the intensity and colors were obtained using the standard 2 data from all the pcus active during the observations .",
    "the intensity is defined as the count rates in the 2.020.0 kev band ; hard color as the count rate ratio of the 16.020 kev and 2.06.0 kev bands .",
    "count rates are background corrected and normalized using the crab nebula observations .",
    "this method of normalization @xcite is based on the assumption that the crab nebula is constant in intensity and hard color .",
    "it is used to correct for differences between pcus ( see , e.g. * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "the timing analysis was done with the event mode data in the 260 kev range .",
    "power spectra were generated for each observation by averaging the fast fourier transform power spectra of continuous 128-s intervals , with a nyquist frequency of 4096 hz and a lowest frequency of 7.8 mhz .",
    "periods of dipping activity in the x - ray light curves , as reported by @xcite , were not excluded from our timing analysis .",
    "the poisson noise spectrum is estimated with the analytical function of @xcite and subtracted from this average power spectrum .",
    "the resulting power spectrum is expressed in source fractional rms normalization @xcite , using the average background rate during the observation .",
    "each power spectrum was fit with a multi - lorentzian ( 15 components ) function and ( when necessary ) a power law .",
    "we performed a spectral analysis for only a few selected observations , including those cases where hid location and timing properties were inconclusive with respect to the spectral state of the source .",
    "spectra were extracted from the standard 2 mode data of pcu2 , using heasoft v6.10 .",
    "the spectra were background subtracted , corrected for dead time , and a systematic error of 0.6% was applied .",
    "fits were made with xspec v12.6.0 @xcite between 3.040.0 kev , with phenomenological models consisting of a simple accretion disk component ( diskbb ) , a ( cut - off ) power - law , and a gaussian line ( fixed at 6.4 kev ) . reported fluxes are in the 220 kev band and are corrected for interstellar absorption , which was fixed to @xmath0 atoms@xmath1 , the average value in the direction of j1659 @xcite .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig : inhcrms ] shows the 1.520 kev light curve from _ maxi_. it includes the early rise and late decay , which were not covered by our _ rxte _ data set ( see below ) .",
    "panels b  e of figure [ fig : inhcrms ] show the _ rxte _ 220 kev light curve , hardness curve , time evolution of fractional rms amplitude ( 0.01100 hz ) , and qpo frequency evolution , respectively .",
    "the outburst showed a relatively rapid rise ; when it was first observed with _",
    "rxte _ , three days after discovery , it already had a flux of 6.6@xmath210@xmath3 ergs/@xmath4/s .",
    "the rise was followed by an extended plateau during which some irregular intensity variations ( time scale of a few days ) were observed ( hereafter referred to as ` flares ' ) . during two observations in this flaring phase ( mjd 55488.02 and 55490.11 ) we observed several rapid ( @xmath520 s ) , almost step - function - like changes in the count rate from the source .",
    "the changes were on the order of 30% , lasted @xmath51001500 s , and were not accompanied by changes in the spectral hardness .",
    "similar phenomena have been observed in , e.g. , gx 339 - 4 and xte j1859 + 226 @xcite and have been referred to as ` flip - flops ' . for both observations",
    "the high and low count rate levels were separated and treated as different observations for the remainder of our analysis ( and are plotted separately in figures [ fig : inhcrms][fig : hcinrms ] ) .",
    "the flux reached its maximum during a flare on october 8 ( mjd 55477 ) at a value of 1@xmath610@xmath7 ergs/@xmath4/s .",
    "a sudden radio flux decrease was reported for that day @xcite . from the intensity plateau",
    "the source evolved towards a slow decay , after which it presumably returned to quiescence .",
    "the flux during the last _ rxte _ observation was 1.4@xmath210@xmath3 ergs/@xmath8/s .",
    "figure [ fig : hcinrms]a shows the hid .",
    "the source started in the upper - right corner and traversed its track in an anti - clockwise manner , ending in the lower - right corner .",
    "hysteresis is observed in the spectral evolution , with the hard - to - soft spectral evolution occurring at a count rate @xmath53 times higher than the soft - to - hard spectral evolution .",
    "while the spectral evolution during the early and late phases of the outburst was largely monotonic , the source exhibited frequent back - and - forth motion in spectral hardness during the flaring phase of the outburst .",
    "since _ rxte _ did not observe j1659 during the first three days of its outburst , we used _",
    "@xcite data to infer the spectral evolution during the early rise .",
    "we plot the _ maxi _ hid in figure [ fig : hcinrms]c .",
    "overall , the path traced out is similar to that seen in the _ rxte _ hid .",
    "the first part of the _ maxi _ hid ( i.e.  the right vertical branch and subsequent left turn ) was not covered by _",
    "rxte_. a comparison with hids of other bhts suggests that during the first three days of the outburst , j1659 evolved through parts of the lhs and hims .",
    "@xcite reported that during the softest part of the outburst j1659 reached the hss .",
    "we performed a spectral fit of the observation with the lowest spectra hardness ( mjd 55489.26 ) to verify this .",
    "we obtain an excellent fit ( reduced @xmath9=0.96 , for 62 d.o.f . ) with a 0.8 kev disk black - body and a power - law component with index 2.2 ( plus a weak gaussian at 6.4 kev ) .",
    "the disk component contributed @xmath560% to the 220 kev flux .",
    "@xcite does not provide a spectral definition of the hss , but following the definition of the soft ( or thermal dominant ) state by @xcite , which uses 75% as a lower limit , we conclude that the source did not reach the soft state during this outburst .",
    "this behavior is similar to , e.g. , the 2000 outburst of xte j1550564 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : hcinrms]b shows the relation between hard color and broad - band rms .",
    "such a diagram can be helpful in identifying different types of power spectra @xcite . at high hard colors , hardness and rms",
    "are correlated , but at low hard colors ( @xmath100.5 ) there is considerable scatter .",
    "based on the overall strength of the broad - band variability , the spectral hardness , and the shape of the power spectra ( noise / qpos ) we divided our _ rxte _ observations into five groups ( see symbols in figures [ fig : inhcrms]-[fig : hcinrms ] ) . for the classification of the pds and the qpos , we made use of the classification schemes of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "representative power spectra are shown in figure [ pds ] and are referred to as pds 15 .",
    "the group 1 pds have strong 0.01100 hz variability ( @xmath523% ) , a strong qpo ( varying between 1.68.5 hz ) , at times with a harmonic and a sub - harmonic . they were observed during the spectrally hard parts of the outburst ( hard color @xmath11 0.45 ; see open circles in figures [ fig : inhcrms ] and [ fig : hcinrms ] ) .",
    "the frequency is strongly anti - correlated with spectral hardness ( fig .",
    "[ fig : inhcrms]e ) .",
    "the qpo frequencies and q values , and the fractional rms amplitude in the 0.01100 hz frequency range are typical of pds exhibiting type ",
    "c qpos , as observed in the hims ( no phase lags or energy dependence of the qpos were measured ) .",
    "hence , we identify these qpos as type  c .",
    "the group 2 pds have 0.01100 hz variability @xmath10 10% rms and power - law noise as opposed to the strong variability and peaked noise of the group 1 pds .",
    "these pds are observed in a fairly narrow range of spectral hardness , have qpos with frequencies between 2.6 and 4.1 hz , at times accompanied by a harmonic and a sub - harmonic , and cluster in a small patch of points in the hardness - rms diagram . in figure",
    "[ rmsvsfreq ] , we plot the 0.01100 hz fractional rms amplitude vs. frequency of these and the pds with type  c qpos , as well as the pds with the unclassified qpos ( see below ) .",
    "what we observe in figure [ rmsvsfreq ] is very similar to the results of @xcite , indicating that these are type ",
    "b qpos , which classifies these observations as sims .",
    "fractional rms amplitude anti - correlates with frequency for type ",
    "c qpo , while type ",
    "b qpos do not follow such an anti - correlation .",
    "note that after the detection of the first two type  b qpos ( at 3.9 hz and 4.1 hz ) , the spectrum temporarily hardened during the next two observations , and type ",
    "c qpos ( at 6.0 and 6.9 hz ) were observed , ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : inhcrms ] ) followed again by type ",
    "b qpos ( 3.9 and 3.5 hz ) .",
    "this indicates rapid sims / hims transitions @xcite over a period of @xmath56 days .      in the soft part of the outburst most power spectra",
    "do not show clear indications for qpos .",
    "such power spectra were observed during two time intervals . during the first time interval ( mjd 5548655590 ) the source intensity moved up and down on a daily basis",
    " this is also the period during which the flip - flops were observed ( see  [ sec : lc ] ) .",
    "inspection of the individual power spectra revealed subtle differences between the low count rate and high count rate observations .",
    "pds3 is the averaged power spectrum of the five high count rate level observations ( weak1 in figures [ fig : inhcrms ] and [ fig : hcinrms ] ) ; it is consistent with a single power - law with no distinguishable features .",
    "the low - count rate observations show indications for an additional broad bump around 78 hz .",
    "such a feature is also seen for the observations in the second interval with weak power ( mjd 55496.555498.5 ) .",
    "pds4 is the averaged power spectrum of these nine observations ( weak2 in figures [ fig : inhcrms ] and [ fig : hcinrms ] ) .",
    "the pds4-like power spectra occurred at slightly lower hardness than the pds3 ones .",
    "power spectra similar to pds3 and pds4 were observed in gx 339 - 4 @xcite and were grouped together with power spectra that show type - a ( not observed here , see below ) and type - b qpo to define the sims .",
    "therefore , also based on this definition j1659 did not reach the hss .",
    "for three power spectra that showed somewhat broad qpos ( q@xmath51.63.5 ) we had difficulty assigning a classification  they are marked as unclassified in figures [ fig : inhcrms][rmsvsfreq ] .",
    "the observations were among the shortest ( 800 s ) and the power spectra were of lower quality .",
    "however , the locations of these observations in figure [ rmsvsfreq ] ( and also fig .",
    "[ fig : hcinrms]b ) suggest that these qpos may be type ",
    "b qpos with a lower frequency ( @xmath51.9 hz ) and also lower q - value , which would classify these observations as sims .",
    "we did not see indications for type  a qpos in our observations .",
    "these are typically accompanied by similarly shaped noise as type ",
    "b qpos , but show no strong harmonic content ( as seen in pds2 ) .",
    "also in the rms - frequency plot they fall in a different location than type  b qpos @xcite , which argues against the qpos in the type pds5-like power spectra being of type  a .",
    "high - frequency qpos in the the 50450 hz range have been reported for a handful of bhts @xcite .",
    "we inspected all individual power spectra in the total 260 kev band , as well as in the 5.760 kev band , but no indications for such qpos were found .",
    "we also inspected the averaged power spectra of the different groups ( with groups 2 and 5 added together ) .",
    "again , no significant qpos were found , with a 2.1@xmath12 measurement of a peak at @xmath5160 hz ( q@xmath54 , @xmath54% rms ) in the 260 kev power spectrum of pds 4 constituting our most significant detection .",
    "we analyzed all the _ rxte _ observations of maxi  j1659152 taken during its 2010 outburst .",
    "spectral states were identified using the hid in combination with the aperiodic variability properties . in the hid",
    "j1659 traced out an anti - clockwise loop , similar to those seen in black hole and neutron - star transients ( see  [ intro ] ) .",
    "the types of power spectral features we identified ( in particular type ",
    "b and type ",
    "c qpos ) and the way they evolve along the hid track , indicates that j1659 is a black hole candidate . the spectral decomposition of the softest spectrum ( i.e.  diskbb + power - law , without the need for second thermal component ; @xcite ) , the radio loudness in the early part of the outburst @xcite , the flip - flops seen in two observations , and the sudden ( @xmath5day ) drop in the rms ( i.e. pds3 ) at low - hardness , are all characteristic of this type of systems @xcite , strengthening our identification of j1659 as a black hole candidate .    based on spectral and variability properties",
    "we find that j1659 moved from a hims to a sims and back again ( at lower intensity ) , without reaching the hss ( or the soft or thermal dominant state as defined by @xcite ) .",
    "our _ rxte _ observations started after the source had left the lhs ( as indicated by _",
    "observations ) , and ended before it had returned to that state .",
    "the observations in the softest part of the sims had weak variability and revealed two types of power spectra , one consistent with a power - law and one with an additional bump around 78 hz .",
    "we note that similar groups of observations with weak variability were observed in the sims of gx 3394 by @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that radio flares and subsequent quenching of the radio flux often occur in a time interval of a few days before and after the time of sudden drops in the rapid x - ray variability ( identified as a distinct zone in their rms - hardness diagrams ) . in j1659",
    "a similar drop occurred on mjd 55481 , a few days after the quenching of the radio flux as reported by @xcite , consistent with other bhts .",
    "optical observations constraining the mass of the compact object are required to confirm the black hole nature of j1659 . from dipping episodes in the x - ray light curves ,",
    "the orbital period period has been proposed to be 2.42.5 hour @xcite .",
    "this makes the source very interesting as , if confirmed , this would make it the black hole binary with the shortest known orbital period .    *",
