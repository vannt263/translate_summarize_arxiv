    "anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) are magnetar candidates , i.e. , neutron stars powered by strong magnetic field decay ( thompson & duncan 1995 , 1996 ) . in studying them ,",
    "the assumption of magnetic dipole braking is often employed ( duncan & thompson 1992 ; kouveliotou et al .",
    "however , the magnetic dipole braking mechanism is originally designed for rotation - powered pulsars . since both the persistent and burst emissions of magnetars are from a different energy reservoir ( magnetic energy instead of rotational energy ) , it is possible that they have a different braking mechanism , e.g. , wind braking ( harding et al .",
    "1999 ; thompson et al .",
    "2000 ) .    a strong dipole magnetic field obtained by assuming magnetic dipole braking",
    "is often taken as confirmation of a neutron star s magnetar nature ( @xmath1 , kouveloitou et al .",
    "however , the magnetic dipole braking assumption will also result in several problems challenging the magnetar model ( mereghetti 2008 ; tong & xu 2011 ) .    1",
    ".   the spin down time scale of a newly born magnetar will be less than the shock breakout time due to the presence of a strong dipole magnetic field .",
    "this will cause the supernovae associated with magnetars more energetic than canonical supernovae ( duncan & thompson 1992 ) .",
    "however , observations of supernova remnants associated with axps and sgrs show that the corresponding supernova energies are of canonical value ( vink & kuiper 2006 ) .",
    "this failed prediction of the magnetar model may be circumvented if the initial rotational energy of magnetars are carried away in non - electromagnetic form , e.g. , gravitational waves ( dallosso et al .",
    "2009 ) . however , in dallosso et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , a relatively low dipole magnetic field is also required ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "if magnetars have a different braking mecahnism and consequently their dipole magnetic field is much lower , this may explain their supernova energy problem .",
    "if axps and sgrs are neutron stars with strong dipole field , then although they rotate rather slowly ( periods : @xmath3@xmath4 seconds ) , they will also accelerate particles to very high energy . in the outer magnetosphere",
    ", these particles will emit high - energy gamma - rays which are detectable by @xmath5-lat ( cheng & zhang 2001 ) .",
    "this may be viewed as an independent measurement of strong dipole magnetic field , i.e. , through unipolar induction effect",
    ". however , @xmath5-lat observations of all axps and sgrs show no significant detection ( sasmaz mus & gogus 2010 ; abdo et al . 2010 ) .",
    "therefore , there are conflicts between the out gap model in the case of magnetars and _ fermi_-lat observations ( tong et al . 2010a , 2011 ) .",
    "it is possible that magnetars have a different braking mechanism and their dipole magnetic field is not so strong .",
    "3 .   in the traditional picture of the magnetar model ,",
    "magnetars are young neutron stars with both strong dipole field and strong multipole field ( thompson & duncan 1995 , 1996 ; thompson et al .",
    "the observation of the low magnetic field soft gamma - ray repeater sgr 0418 + 5729 has challenged the traditional magnetar prescription ( rea et al .",
    "this source tells us that magnetar - like activities ( an anomalous x - ray luminosity or sgr - type bursts ) do not require a strong dipole magnetic field .",
    "the timing of sgr swift j1822.31606 further strengthens this point ( rea et al .",
    "the originally required strong dipole magnetic field in most axps and sgrs mainly provides the braking torque .",
    "it is possible that not only sgr 0418 + 5729 but also many other axps and sgrs do not have a strong dipole magnetic field if they have a different braking mechanism .",
    "4 .   there are high magnetic field rotation - powered pulsars ( hbpsrs ) along with magnetars ( ng & kaspi 2011 ) .",
    "although they are close to each other on the @xmath6@xmath7 diagram , they show very different timing behavior .",
    "the timing behaviors of hbpsrs are similar to that of normal pulsars ( ng & kaspi 2011 ) .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable that they have the same braking mechanism as that of normal pulsars .",
    "however , magnetars are very noisy ( gavriil & kaspi 2002 ; woods et al . 2002 ; archibald et al . 2008 ) , and the period derivatives of magnetars can vary significantly ( up to a factor of 10 , gavriil & kaspi 2004 ; camilo et al .",
    "2007 ; woods et al . 2007 ) .",
    "therefore , it is possible that magnetars have a different braking mechanism , e.g. wind braking .",
    "the variation of wind luminosity will cause the variation of their period derivatives .",
    "all these issues are related to the dipole magnetic field and the braking mechanism of magnetars .",
    "a different braking mechanism of magnetars may help to solve these problems .",
    "electrodynamics of magnetars show that they may have globally twisted magnetospheres ( thompson et al .",
    "2002 ; beloborodov & thompson 2007 ) . the twisted magnetosphere will enhance their spin - down torque and also modify their persistent emissions .",
    "changes in their global magnetospheric structure will result in changes in their spin - down rate and persistent flux ( beloborodov 2009 ) . in the case of wind braking ,",
    "the large scale dipole field is unchanged .",
    "it is the change of the particle wind luminosity that causes change of the spin - down rate .",
    "since both their persistent emissions and the particle wind are magnetism - powered , it is natural that their spin - down behavior and persistent emissions are correlated .",
    "based on previous researches ( harding et al .",
    "1999 ; thompson et al .",
    "2000 ) , we explore the wind braking of magnetars in more detail and apply it to all axps and sgrs . a comparison with up - to - date observations is also given .",
    "observations supporting the existence of a particle wind in magnetars are given in section 2 .",
    "rotational energy loss rate due to a particle wind is calculated in section 3 .",
    "several aspects of wind braking of magnetars are given in section 4 .",
    "discussions and conclusions are presented in section 5 and 6 , respectively .",
    "in the magnetic dipole braking scenario of normal pulsars , the star s rotational energy is carried away by magnetic dipole radiation plus a rotation - powered particle wind ( michel 1969 ; xu & qiao 2001 ; spitkovsky 2006 ) .",
    "the rotational energy loss rate is quantitatively similar to the magnetic dipole radiation in vacuum ( xu & qiao 2001 ; spitkovsky 2006 ) .",
    "the surface dipole magnetic field is almost the same as that of magnetic dipole braking in vacuum .",
    "a particle wind mainly causes higher order modifications of pulsar timing , e.g. braking index ( michel 1969 ; manchester et al .",
    "1985 ; xu & qiao 2001 ; contopoulos & spitkovsky 2006 ; wang et al . 2012 ) and timing noise ( lyne et al . 2010 ; liu et al . 2011 ) . around young neutron stars ,",
    "we may see a rotation - powered pulsar wind nebula ( gaensler & slane 2006 ) .    in the case of magnetars ,",
    "the star s persistent x - ray luminosity is much higher than its rotational energy loss rate .",
    "since the persistent x - ray luminosity is from magnetic field decay , it is possible that a particle flow ( i.e. , a magnetism - powered particle wind ) is also produced during the decay of the star s magnetic field .",
    "the luminosity of this particle wind can be as high as the star s persistent x - ray luminosity , therefore it can also be much higher than the star s rotational energy loss rate ( duncan 2000 ; section 2.3 below ) .",
    "this particle wind will `` comb out '' the magnetic field lines in the closed field line regions ( harding et al .",
    "the net result is an enhanced rotational energy loss rate for a given dipole magnetic field ( harding et al .",
    "1999 ; thompson et al .",
    "2000 ; section 3 below ) . in this `` wind aided '' spin down scenario , the corresponding dipole magnetic field will be much lower than the magnetic dipole braking case ( harding et al .",
    "1999 ; section 4 below ) .",
    "wind braking of magnetars will also help us to explain recent observations challenging the the traditional magnetar model ( section 4 and 5 below ) .",
    "below , we assume that the star s dipole magnetic field is constant during its life time .",
    "it is the evolution and variation of particle wind luminosity that cause the evolution and variation of axps / sgrs timing properties .",
    "for example , a short term variation of particle wind will cause a variation of the star s period derivative and also contribute to its timing noise .",
    "the existence of a ( rotation - powered ) particle wind in normal pulsars is well established .",
    "the observations of intermittent pulsars give direct support for the existence a particle wind ( kramer et al .",
    "2006 ; camilo et al .",
    "2012 ) . however , the existence of a magnetism - powered particle wind in magnetars is still unknown",
    ". below we will give several observations of axps and sgrs , which may provide some hints for the existence of a particle wind",
    "the axp 1e 2259 + 586 experiences an enhanced period of spin down during outburst ( kaspi et al .",
    "variations of period derivative are also seen in axp 1e 1048.15937 ( gavriil & kaspi 2004 ) , axp xte j1810197 ( camilo et al .",
    "2007 ) , sgr 180620 ( woods et al . 2007 ) and axp 1e 1547.05408 ( camilo et al . 2008 ) etc .",
    "a decreasing period derivative is also observed in the radio - loud magnetar , accompanying by a decaying x - ray luminosity and radio luminosity ( levin et al .",
    "2012 ; anderson et al .",
    "this may be due to a decaying particle wind during outbursts .",
    "+ in the absence of a strong particle wind , an untwisting magnetosphere of a magnetar may explain the decreasing period derivative ( beloborodov 2009 ) .",
    "however the dipole field is of large scale compared with that of multipole field , a varying dipole field ( especially short time scale variations ) is hard to accomplish ( camilo et al .",
    "2007 ; levin et al . 2012 ) . in the case of wind braking of magnetars ,",
    "the global dipole field is unchanged .",
    "since the particle wind may be the consequences of small amplitude seismic activities ( thompson & duncan 1996 ) , it can vary dramatically even on short time scales .",
    "a varying particle wind will cause a varying period derivative .",
    "the long term decay of particle wind luminosity during outburst can account for the decreasing period derivative ( e.g. , axp xte j1810197 , camilo et al . 2007 ; the radio - loud magnetar , levin et al . 2012 ) . during an outburst , we should expect the wind luminosity first increases then decreases .",
    "this will cause the period derivative first increases then decreases , which may be the case of sgr 1806 - 20 ( woods et al . 2007 ) and axp 1e 1547.0 - 5408 ( before outburst , camilo et al .",
    "2 .   axps and sgrs have a higher level of timing noise than normal pulsars ( gavriil & kaspi 2002 ; woods et al .",
    "2002 ; archibald et al .",
    "2008 ) . the timing noise may be correlated with period derivatives .",
    "the timing noise of normal pulsars may be the result of a varying ( rotation - powered ) particle wind ( lyne et al .",
    "2010 ; liu et al .",
    "then it is possible that axps and sgrs are also braked down by a particle wind .",
    "since axps and sgrs are magnetism - powered , the particle wind may also from magnetic field decay , i.e. , a magnetism - powered particle wind .",
    "this magnetism - powered particle wind may vary significantly with time , similar to the magnetar s persistent x - ray luminosity .",
    "then it may cause a higher level of timing noise in magnetars than that in normal pulsars and hbpsrs .",
    "if axps and sgrs harbor a strong enough particle wind ( either rotation - powered or magnetism - powered ) , then we should see a pulsar wind nebula around the putative star .",
    "if the the particle wind is magnetism - powered , the same as that of their persistent x - ray luminosities , then we should see some correlation between the nebula luminosity and the stellar luminosity .",
    "a possible extended emission is found around axp 1e 1547.05408 ( vind & bamba 2009 ) .",
    "the luminosity of the extended emission is correlated with the star s luminosity ( olausen et al . 2011 ) .",
    "therefore , the extended emission around axp 1e 1547.05408 may be a magnetism - powered pulsar wind nebula instead of a duct scattering halo .",
    "if this is confirmed in the future , it will be a strong evidence for the existence a magnetism - powered particle wind in magnetars .",
    "+ a magnetism - powered pulsar wind nebula may also accelerate particles to very high energy and radiate high energy photons . an extended emission and a tev source",
    "are both seen in the case of sgr swift j1834.90846 ( kargaltsev et al . 2012 ) .",
    "if the extended emission is found to be a pulsar wind nebula and the associated with the tev source is confirmed , then it is also likely to be a magnetism - powered pulsar wind nebula .",
    "a candidate pulsar wind nebula which may contain magnetic energy contribution is seen around rrat j18191458 ( rea et al .",
    "2009 ) .    in summary",
    ", there are many uncertainties and ambiguities if we attribute the above observations to a particle wind in magnetars .",
    "however , we do not know whether axps and sgrs have a ( magnetism - powered ) particle wind or not .",
    "the possibility of such a particle wind can not be ruled out by present observations either .",
    "a magnetism - powered particle wind in magnetars is helpful to our understanding of the different observational aspects stated above .",
    "therefore , the above observational facts may give us some clues for the existence of a particle wind in magnetars .",
    "whether a particle wind really exists or not can be tested by future studies .      in the magnetar model ,",
    "the bursts and outbursts are related with the magnetar s seismic activities ( thompson & duncan 1995 , 1996 ) .",
    "if the observable bursts are associated with large amplitude seismic activities , then the low amplitude seismic activities may mainly result in a particle wind ( thompson & duncan 1996 ) .",
    "according to thompson & duncan ( 1996 , eq.(71 ) there ) , the particle wind luminosity is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is crustal field strength , @xmath10 is the star s age , and @xmath11 is the crustal thickness .",
    "the above equation is only valid for crustal field strength less than @xmath12 , above which the crust may undergo plastic deformations .",
    "the persistent x - ray luminosity of axps and sgrs are from magnetic field decay , e.g. , internal heating ( thompson & duncan 1996 ) or magnetospheric current heating ( thomspon et a. 2002 ; beloborodov & thompson 2007 ) . a particle wind may also be produced during this process . since the particle wind and the persistent x - ray luminosity are from the same energy reservoir , a natural estimation of the particle wind luminosity is ( duncan 2000 ) @xmath13 which is valid for most axps and sgrs . for the transient magnetars , they have a lower quiescent x - ray luminosity .",
    "their particle wind luminosity may also be correspondingly lower .    in the wind braking scenario ,",
    "magnetars are neutron stars with strong multipole fields .",
    "the strong twisted mangetic field in the vicinity of magnetars will accelerate particles to very high energy .",
    "thus , a corona of high energy particle will be formed ( beloborodov & thompson 2007 ) . the footprint of magnetic field lines are anchored to the stellar crust . in the presence of frequent low amplitude seismic activities ,",
    "the corona of magnetars will be disturbed continuously .",
    "the excitation of such a particle wind in magnetars may be due to their seismic activities , especially small amplitude seismic activities ( thompson & duncan 1996 ; thompson & duncan 2001 ; timokhin et al .",
    "2008 ) . the particles in the magnetar magnetosphere can flow out in two ways .",
    "( 1 ) during bursts and giant flares .",
    "this burst component of particle wind has its duty cycles ( thompson & duncan 1995 ; see numerical simulations of parfrey et al .",
    "2012 ; section 4.5 below ) .",
    "( 2 ) during persistent state .",
    "the long term average of many small amplitude seismic activities may result in a persistent particle outflow of magnetars ( thompson & duncan 1996 ; duncan 2000 ) .",
    "we will mainly focus on the persistent component of particle wind .    in conclusion , we have already some observational clues for the existence of a particle wind in magnetars .",
    "their luminosities can also be estimated , although the underlying mechanism is still lacking . since both the magnetar s persistent x - ray luminosity and the particle wind are from magnetic field decay",
    ", the particle wind luminosity may be as high as their persistent x - ray luminosities .",
    "therefore , the particle wind luminosity in magnetars can be much higher than their rotational energy loss rate .",
    "the existence of such a strong particle wind will modify the spin - down behavior of magnetars qualitatively .",
    "the magnetospheres of pulsars and magnetars contain regions of open and closed magnetic field .",
    "the closed field lines extend to the light cylinder radius in the case of normal pulsars ( contopoulos & spitkovksy 2006 ) . in the case of magnetars ,",
    "the closed field line region may be smaller . in the presence of a strong particle wind ,",
    "the natural radial extension of closed field line regions is the radius where the kinetic energy density of particle wind equals the magnetic energy density ( harding et al .",

    "particle flows in the closed field line regions belong to the domain of closed field line region electrodynamics of magnetars ( thomspon et al .",

    "since both the particle wind and the persistent x - ray luminosity of a magnetar are from magnetic field decay , there will be a strong correlation between them .",

    "et al . ( 2011 ) , they see a strong correlation between the extended emission of axp 1e 1547.0 - 5408 and its source flux . therefore , olausen et al . concluded that the pulsar wind nebula origin for the extended emission is ruled out and it is a dust scattering halo .",
    "however , a strong correlation between the extended emission and the source flux just rules out the rotation - powered pulsar wind nebula hypothesis .",
    "such a correlation is a natural result if the pulsar wind nebula is magnetism - powered .",

    ", an extreme case is that the nebula luminosity can exceed that of the star s rotational energy loss rate @xmath196 .",
    "however , for young magnetars , their rotational energy loss rates are also very high .",

    "a possible case is that we can see a high conversion efficiency of the putative nebula .",
    "the possible pulsar wind nebula seen around rrat j1819@xmath821458 has a relatively high conversion efficiency ( rea et al .",
