    "in the last decade , high - contrast _ direct imaging _ observations of young stars have provided a way to identify , confirm , and study the properties of self - luminous planet - mass companions around nearby stars undetectable by radial - velocity and transits ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "these companions are typically found at wide ( @xmath10 @xmath1 25 - 300 @xmath4 ) separations .",
    "besides fomalhaut b ( m @xmath11 2 @xmath9 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , they have super jovian ( @xmath12 @xmath3 415 @xmath9 ) masses .",
    "thus , these objects significantly challenge even advanced models for forming them as planets ( by core accretion or disk instability ) or as very low - mass binary companions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus far , these companions can be divided into two groups : 1 ) low companion - to - star mass ratio objects like hr 8799 bcde and @xmath13 pic b comprising the extrema of a population extending to planets detected by radial - velocity and plausibly formed by core accretion and 2 ) high mass ratio companions ( e.g. gsc 06214b ) comprising the tail of a population extending up to brown dwarf masses ( @xmath12 @xmath14 13 - 15 @xmath9 ) and formed by other means @xcite .",
    "some companions have a more ambiguous nature due to their uncertain ages ( and , thus , uncertain masses / mass ratios ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "companions with well - defined ages could better probe the extremes of these populations , clarifying or blurring the distinction between bona fide planets and the lowest mass brown dwarfs .    in this letter ,",
    "we report direct imaging and spectroscopy of a candidate 615 @xmath9 companion to roxs 42b , a binary m star and likely member of the @xmath0 ophiuchus star - forming region , that may add to the list of rare wide separation , young imaged planet - mass companions .",
    "roxs 42b was originally identified as an m0 , possibly x - ray emitting star @xcite and member of the 13 @xmath15 @xmath0 ophiuchus star - forming region @xcite located between the l1888 and l1989n / s clouds .",
    "lunar occulation measurements showed it to be a close binary ( @xmath10 @xmath1 005 ) @xcite where the brighter ( m0 ) component contributes two - thirds of the system brightness @xcite .",
    "sensitive optical to ( sub)millimeter data reveal no clear evidence for circumstellar gas or dust ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "we initially identified a candidate 3rd member of the roxs 42b system located at a projected separation of @xmath3 116 as a part of a general search for planet / brown dwarf companions in archival keck , subaru , and vlt data @xcite .",
    "as we later found , @xcite identified the same 3rd member as a point source from speckle imaging data obtained in 2001 .",
    "although they did not estimate the object s mass , their @xmath7-band flux ratio ( 0.002 @xmath16 0.001 ) implied a mass below the deuterium - burning limit given the age and distance of @xmath0 oph and standard hot - star planet evolution models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , spurring us to rereduce additional archival data to confirm or reject its status as a bound companion and determine from multiwavelength photometry and spectroscopy whether its sed is consistent with those for other young directly - imaged planetary - mass companions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "our combined data set ( table 1 ) includes keck / nirc2 and subaru / ciao near ir imaging and vlt / sinfoni integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ) and astrometry from @xcite .",
    "the keck / nirc2 and subaru / ciao data we consider were taken in three epochs between 2005 and 2011 in the @xmath5 , @xmath7 or @xmath6 broadband filters .",
    "the first keck epoch data and ciao data were obtained with ( extremely ) modest ao corrections , while the 2011 keck and vlt images were nearly diffraction limited .",
    "all data were obtained in classical imaging , not _ angular differential imaging _",
    "@xcite , and in various dither / nod patterns to remove the sky background .",
    "the field of view was @xmath3 10 , 20 , and 3 arc - seconds on a side for the nirc2 , ciao , and sinfoni data , respectively .",
    "the sinfoni spectral resolution was r @xmath3 1500 .",
    "the primary in each data set was unsaturated .",
    "basic image processing steps for the photometric data followed those taken for ir data that were likewise obtained in a dither pattern ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "after sky subtraction , identifying and removing hot / cold / bad pixels , correcting each image for distortion ( for nirc2 data only ) and copying each to larger blank image , we registered the images to a common center following standard methods used before for centroiding unsaturated psf cores . finally , we subtracted off a 2d radial profile of the primary to remove the halo light from each image , median - combined them , and rotated the combined image to the north - up position and b , it is at modest contrasts .",
    "thus , we did not need to perform sophisticated image processing techniques ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ? * ) ] .",
    "using the esorex pipeline , we reduced the sinfoni ifs data , performing sky subtraction , combining the data into a spectroscopic cube , correcting for differential atmospheric refraction and curvature in the spectra .",
    "we extracted the spectra using a 3-pixel radius annulus using qfitsview .",
    "we applied the same reduction and extraction routine to a b9 telluric standard star observed during the same night at similar airmass and with the same instrumental setup .",
    "its extracted spectrum was divided by a blackbody curve according to its effective temperature and its brackett-@xmath17 absorption feature at @xmath18 m replaced by a straight line along the continuum . finally , we divided the extracted spectra of roxs 42b and roxs 42bb by the corrected telluric standard .",
    "figure [ images ] displays each final image from our photometric data and the collapsed cube from the vlt / sinfoni spectroscopy , revealing a candidate companion , roxs 42bb , at @xmath10 = 115117 ( labeled or denoted with an arrow , 3 oclock position in each panel ) at a signal - to - noise ratio greater than 5 .",
    "assuming a distance of 135 @xmath19 @xcite , this angular separation corresponds to a projected physical separation of @xmath3 150 @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath5-band 2011 data set reveal a second candidate at @xmath10 @xmath1 05 ( @xmath3 65 @xmath4 ) , which has roughly the same brightness as roxs 42bb .",
    "the data quality in the other epochs is not sufficient to recover this object .",
    "we do not resolve the two primary stars in any data set .",
    "we use gaussian fitting ( the @xmath20 @xmath21 subroutine ) to determine the position of roxs 42bb in each photometric data set , assuming a fwhm equal to that estimated for the star , and the _ daofind _ centroiding routine for the sinfoni ifs data . for nirc2 astrometric calibration",

    "we adopt a pixel scale of 21.33 mas pixel@xmath22 @xcite and a north position angle offset of 1.14@xmath24 .",
    "figure [ roxs42b_initan ] ( left panel ) compares roxs 42bb s astrometry derived from ciao and nirc2 data to the motion expected for a background object assuming a parallax of 7.4 mas .",
    "we adopt the ucac4 @xcite catalog s proper motion for roxs 42b : @xmath25 @xmath26 , @xmath27 = -5.9 @xmath16 1.6 mas yr@xmath22 , -14.1 @xmath16 1.8 mas yr@xmath22 .",
    "the motion vector predicted for a background star is inconsistent with roxs 42bb s measured astrometry .",
    "the predicted change in position between 2005 and 2011 is @xmath1 @xmath28 @xmath3 [ 40 mas , 100mas ] while our astrometry is nearly consistent with no motion at all : the keck data alone reject a background star hypothesis at more than the 5-@xmath29 level .",
    "the 2012 sinfoni data are undersampled such that deriving astrometry with a precision on par with nirc2 and ciao data is challenging .",
    "nevertheless , our derived position from these data using the fits header information ( @xmath10 @xmath1 115 @xmath16 003 , @xmath23 @xmath1 270@xmath24 @xmath16 2@xmath24 ) is consistent with the 2011 keck astrometry .",
    "a free - floating substellar object at the location of roxs 42bb with a similar space motion would be a rare occurrence . even assuming twice as many young stellar objects as listed in @xcite in @xmath3 29 square degree area covering @xmath0 oph and 10 times as many substellar objects as stellar members instead of an equal amount @xcite or fives times fewer @xcite and that all objects have proper motions indistinguishable from roxs 42b , the probability of contamination on the 10x10 keck / nirc2 field is @xmath3 5@xmath3010@xmath31 .",
    "although astrometry obtained with the same instrument setup ( the 2005 and 2011 nirc2 data ) is formally consistent with no motion considering errors , the astrometric drift from epoch to epoch is also consistent with orbital motion .",
    "between the two keck / nirc2 epochs ( @xmath32 t @xmath1 6 years ) , roxs 42bb changes position by @xmath3 00197 , yielding an apparent space motion of @xmath3 3.2 mas / year . for a planet at 150 @xmath4 on a circular orbit with a primary mass of @xmath3 1 @xmath33 , the mean positional change can be up to 3.8 mas / year for a face - on orbit . while the relative positional changes for roxs 42bb suggests its orbit",
    "may not be viewed face - on , the object could be near periastron , admitting a larger apparent motion .",
    "roxs 42b is unsaturated in each image , has precise _ 2mass _ photometry ( @xmath34 = 9.906 @xmath16 0.02 , @xmath5 = 9.017 @xmath16 0.02 , @xmath6 = 8.671 @xmath16 0.02 ) , and is not known to be variable .",
    "therefore , we flux - calibrated roxs 42bb from the primary fluxes and our contrast measurements ( table 1 ) .",
    "we adopt the keck photometry to yield @xmath35 = 15.88 @xmath16 0.05 and @xmath36 = 15.00 @xmath16 0.15 .",
    "following @xcite , we compare the near ir photometry of roxs 42bb to the sample of l / t dwarfs compiled by @xcite and directly - imaged planet - mass companions ( defined as @xmath12 @xmath37 15 @xmath9 ; see values listed in currie et al",
    ". 2013b ) .",
    "prior to these analyses , we derive the extinction of @xmath38 @xmath1 1.9 from comparing the primary s @xmath39 and @xmath7-band photometry ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to predicted values for pre - main sequence m0 stars @xcite , adopting the extinction law from @xcite with @xmath40 = 3.1 . then we deredden the companion and derive absolute @xmath5 and @xmath7-band magnitudes : @xmath41 = 9.87 @xmath16 0.05 , @xmath42 = 9.13 @xmath16 0.15 .",
    "the right panel of figure [ roxs42b_initan ] compares roxs 42bb to these populations .",
    "the companion s @xmath5-band luminosity is most consistent with late m to early l dwarfs .",
    "however , like planet - mass companions displayed here , it has a redder @xmath5-@xmath6 color than the field sequence , a feature explainable by dustier atmospheres usually associated with low mass / surface gravity objects ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "roxs 42bb shares a very similar color - magnitude diagram position to gsc 06214b and usco ctio 108b @xcite , two substellar objects with masses of @xmath3 616 @xmath9 and 1015 @xmath9 , respectively located in the nearby , slightly older upper scorpius association .",
    "if roxs 42b is a member of @xmath0 oph or at least is similarly aged , it is likely lower mass than gcs 06214b and usco ctio 108b .",
    "our sinfoni @xmath7-band spectrum of roxs 42bb ( figure [ roxs42b_spec ] , top panels ) , when compared to spectra for m and l dwarfs from the @xcite sinfoni library , provides even stronger evidence that the companion is most similar to young objects below / near the deuterium - burning limit .",
    "its spectral shape precludes it from being a stellar companion earlier than @xmath3 m5m6 or a foreground mid l dwarf but appears consistent with at least some objects near the m / l dwarf transition .",
    "furthermore , roxs 42bb s spectrum strongly resembles that for substellar , possibly planet - mass companions ct cha b and ab pic b , which have spectral types m8@xmath43 and l0@xmath43 , respectively ( figure [ roxs42b_spec ] , top - right panel ) .",
    "compared to gsc0847 b , which has a similar spectral type ( m9.5@xmath43 ) but slightly higher inferred mass ( 1535 @xmath9 ) , the roxs 42bb deviates at @xmath44 @xmath1 22.1 @xmath45 .",
    "the spectrum deviates from the field , higher surface gravity ( log(g ) = 55.5 ) l0 dwarf 2m0345 .",
    "the flatness of the @xmath7-band spectrum ( the @xmath46(k ) index ) at 2.172.24 @xmath45 may be a gravity / age diagnostic ( * ? ? ?",

    "roxs 42bb s @xmath46(k ) index ( @xmath1 0.95 ) , as defined in @xcite , is smaller than all but one @xcite library objects , clearly distinguishable from that for objects more massive than @xmath12 @xmath1 15 @xmath9 ( bottom panel ) . thus , roxs 42bb s @xmath7-band spectral shape provides additional evidence that the companion is young and has a low mass / surface gravity . from properties of the best - fitting comparison",
    "spectra , we estimate the following most - likely atmospheric properties for roxs 42bb : a spectral type of m8@xmath43l0@xmath43 , a surface gravity of log(g ) = 3.54.5 , and a temperature of @xmath8 @xmath3 18002600 @xmath7 .",
    "circumstantial evidence suggests that roxs 42b s age may be between that of most @xmath0 oph cloud members and the distributed population .",

    "we present evidence that roxs 42b is likely orbited by a substellar , possibly planetary - mass companion at @xmath2 @xmath3 150 @xmath4 .",
    "roxs 42bb may be valuable in clarifying ( or complicating ) our understanding of the formation of wide - separation planets and brown dwarfs .",
    "to illustrate , in figure [ massratio ] ( right panel ) we compare roxs 42bb s mass ratio to those for the sample of radial - velocity detected planets , brown dwarf companions , and directly - imaged planets around hr 8799 and @xmath13 pic as in @xcite .    as argued by @xcite , a gap exists between hr 8799 bcde and @xmath13 pic b on one side and brown dwarf companions on the other , where the former ( imaged planets ) may be the high mass ratio , wide separation extrema of a population contiguous with rv - detected planets , jupiter , and saturn .",
    "similarly , @xcite compared limits on the frequency of wide - separation companions around stars of different masses to the efficiency of different planet formation mechanisms , concluding that disk instability is unlikely to explain these objects .",
    "although core accretion is inefficient at wide separations and challenged in being able to form 510 @xmath9 companions , it nevertheless probably gave rise to planets like hr 8799 bcde and @xmath13 pic b.    as depicted in figure [ massratio ] , roxs 42bb may somewhat blur the division between bona fide planets and those of the lowest mass brown dwarfs ( i.e. planet - mass brown dwarfs ) .",
    "other means may be required to shed light on the formation of wide - separation , super jovian - mass companions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the system may be especially difficult to interpret if the second companion is likewise bound and substellar .",
    "our preliminary analysis of additional data suggests that this `` roxs 42c '' is brighter than roxs 42bb at @xmath34 band and fainter at @xmath49 , implying significantly bluer colors indicative of a background object .",
    "however , new astrometry is required to demonstrate that it is not bound to the primaries .",

    "<S> we estimate roxs 42bb s mass to be 615 @xmath9 , either below the deuterium burning limit and thus planet mass or straddling the deuterium - burning limit nominally separating planet - mass companions from other substellar objects . given roxs 42b s projected separation and mass with respect to the primaries , it may represent the lowest mass objects formed like binary stars or a class of planet - mass objects formed by protostellar disk fragmentation / disk instability , the latter slightly blurring the distinction between non - deuterium burning planets like hr 8799 bcde and low - mass , deuterium - burning brown dwarfs . </S>"
