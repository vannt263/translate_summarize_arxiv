    "drops of water can levitate above a very hot plate due to the so - called ` leidenfrost ' effect @xcite .",
    "in this situation , drops float on a thin layer of water vapor that results from evaporation in between the hot substrate and the drop .",
    "the shape and dynamics of the vapor layer can be quite complex @xcite and can be used to move liquid along a surface with the help of unevenly textured substrates @xcite . under some conditions ,",
    "drops spontaneously start to oscillate and develop ` star - shapes ' or ` faceted shapes ' @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been found that this phenomenon does not only occur in the case of leidenfrost drops , but also for drops levitating on a steady and ascending uniform airflow at room temperature @xcite .",
    "[ nonpulsedaircushionmodes ] shows examples of levitating star - drops obtained with water , taken from ref .",
    "the origin of the oscillatory instability has remained unclear , but the striking similarities with the leidenfrost stars suggest a common mechanism for both , based only on hydrodynamics and free - surface dynamics , without invoking any thermal effects . drops with faceted shapes have been observed in various systems with a periodic forcing of frequency close to the eigenmodes of the drop .",
    "such drop shapes arise for drops on vertically vibrated hydrophobic substrates @xcite , acoustically levitated drops with low - frequency modulated pressure @xcite , liquid metal drops subjected to an oscillating magnetic field @xcite , or drops on a pulsating air cushion @xcite . using simple arguments @xcite , the appearance of these stars can be explained by the temporal modulation of the eigenfrequency of the drop , due to the external forcing , thus inducing a parametric instability .",
    "this suggests the following scenario for the formation of stars in a _",
    "steady _ ascending airflow : a first instability leads to a vertical oscillation of the drop , which through a secondary , parametric instability leads to the formation of ( period doubled ) oscillating stars .",
    "rayleigh and lamb @xcite already predicted that for small enough deformations and for inviscid spherical drops , the resonance frequencies of the drops are given by : @xmath0 where @xmath1 stands for the resonance frequency of the @xmath2 mode of oscillation , @xmath3 is the radius , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the liquid surface tension and density , respectively .",
    "when the drop shape is different from the ideal spherical case , the resonance frequencies are modified with much more complex expressions , but in the case of a liquid puddle of radius @xmath3 much larger than the averaged drop height @xmath6 , the eigenfrequencies take the following simple expression  @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is now the number of lobes on the drop in the azimuthal direction . note that in practice , the frequencies predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ray ] ) and ( [ eq : cylindricalrayleigh ] ) are very similar .",
    "thus it becomes clear that a parametric instability should occur when the drop radius is modulated in time .",
    "the same happens when due to a periodic external forcing , the drop stands in a time - periodic acceleration field . in that case",
    "the height of the cylindrical liquid puddle @xmath6 also varies periodically , and for a non - wetting condition ( contact - angle close to 180@xmath9 ) this height is simply equal to twice the effective capillary length @xmath10 , @xmath11 being the instantaneous acceleration ( without forcing , @xmath11 is equal to the gravity constant @xmath12 ) . by volume conservation , a time dependence of @xmath6 results into an oscillation of the radius @xmath3 . assuming small deformations , @xmath3 will have the same time - periodicity as the external forcing .",
    "then , star - shaped oscillations by parametric forcing typically display a frequency equal to half of the driving ( vertical oscillation ) frequency @xcite .",

    "@xcite.,width=302 ]    in the case of a steady , non - pulsating air cushion or leidenfrost levitation , the key question is to identify the origin of the vertical oscillations : what is the mechanism that induces a time - periodic instability , which in turn gives rise to vertical oscillations of the drop center - of - mass and shape ?",
    "once the origin of this instability is explained , the appearance of star drops is likely to originate from the parametric instability as stated above .",
    "recent experiments of star drops levitated on a continuous flow air cushion ( fig .",
    "[ nonpulsedaircushionmodes ] ) suggest that these star - drops do not result from a temperature gradient - induced instability , contrary to what was previously hypothesized @xcite .",
    "apart from the oscillatory instability , a levitated drop can develop a ` chimney ' , for which an air bubble develops below the drop and pierces through the center of the drop  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon has been explained theoretically from a breakdown of steady solutions  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the numerics for very viscous drops did not display any oscillatory instability .",
    "therefore , the determination of the mechanisms for oscillations requires a more complex numerical scheme than those of refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper , we experimentally and numerically study drops levitated by an air - cushion , focusing on the instability to chimney formation , oscillations and star drops .",
    "the experiments consist of a significantly improved variant of that in ref .",
    "@xcite , where we now can determine the threshold of instabilities with good accuracy . for the numerics ,",
    "the proximity of the cushion to the drop calls for a method capable of accurately describing the gas - liquid interface , which leads us to employing an inviscid boundary integral method for the description of the drop . inspired by the success of lubrication models in providing steady solutions for the drop shape we use a lubrication approximation for the airflow below the drop ( fig .",
    "[ fig : method ] ) .",
    "this coupling has also been applied to simulate the impact of liquid drops on solid plates , and appeared to be successful in the regimes of both small and large impact velocities @xcite .",

    "the numerics consist of a coupling between the boundary integral method for the inviscid drop , and the lubrication approximation for the airflow beneath the drop .",

    "results of these experiments are shown in section [ sec : experimental results ] .",
    "then , we describe the numerical scheme in detail ( section [ sec : numerical method ] ) , and show the different regimes exhibited by the model ( section [ sec : numerical results ] ) . in the last section ,",
    "we conclude on these results .",
    "it is well known that in case of leidenfrost drops , the drops are levitated by a vapor layer .",
    "the vapor , coming directly from the drop , generates a cushioning layer for levitation due to the build up of a lubrication pressure between the lower part of the drop and the substrate . to avoid temperature effects and to directly control the gas flux in the layer , another experimental method was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this experimental method",
    "the air cushion is created by an ascending airflow ( fig .  [",
    "fig : problemsketch ] ) .",
    "the airflow is forced through a porous glass medium ( duran group , filter funnel , porosity 3 , inner diameter 56 mm ) that is covered by a coarse grid .",
    "the bronze grid is made super - hydrophobic ( electroless galvanic deposited metal @xcite and humid low - surface energy molecular deposition ) to avoid imbibition of the hydrophilic porous medium . the large pressure load on the porous medium creates an approximately homogeneous outflow , which is assumed to be hardly affected by the small pressure load of the drop .",
    "consequently , if the airflow @xmath13 is large enough , a lubricating layer ( air cushion ) can emerge and support the complete weight of the drop .",
    "there exists a threshold drop size @xmath3 and gas flow rate @xmath13 at which the drops become unstable and start to oscillate , i.e. the instability threshold .",
    "the airflow is measured with an aalborg flow meter ( range : 0 - 60 l / min ) . since the drop is very mobile in the levitated state",
    ", it is necessary to hold it using a needle .",
    "this fixates the drop at a constant location on the substrate .",
    "the same needle is used to supply and subtract liquid from the drop via a syringe . to study the drop behavior for various flow rates @xmath13 and drop sizes @xmath3 , the drop motions are recorded from top view , with a high speed camera at @xmath14 fps ( phantom v9 ) . using a macro lens ( nikon aspherical macro , 1:2 ) with extension tubes , a resolution of 42 @xmath15/pixel",
    "is obtained ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : problemsketch ] ) .",
    "reflective illumination ( idt , led lightsource ) is realised via a 45 degrees tilted beam splitter .",
    "the aim of this work is to study the instability threshold ( appearance of drop oscillations ) for levitated drops . to verify reproducibility of the experiment",
    ", each measurement is repeated multiple times and by two different procedures . in the first method ,",
    "each measurement starts with a new constant flow rate @xmath16 and a small drop size @xmath3 .",
    "then the drop volume is slowly increased by pumping liquid into it .",
    "the feeding is continued until the drop reaches a floating state ( @xmath17 ) which finally becomes unstable once the drop size equals the threshold size @xmath18 for flow rate @xmath19 .",
    "the volume increase of the drop is directly stopped and subsequently , the dynamics of the unstable drop at the threshold value are recorded with the camera .",
    "note that the threshold for levitation and that for the appearance of oscillations are very close to each other . a second method to determine the instability threshold is measurement of @xmath20 , obtained after drops have turned unstable . for a drop starting in the unstable state at @xmath21",
    ", the airflow is slowly reduced until a value is reached which results in a stable state : @xmath22 .",
    "this second threshold @xmath23 turns out to be slightly smaller than @xmath24 .",
    "however , the difference is comparable to the accuracy of the measurements of @xmath23 , so we can not make any definite statements on whether or not the instability is hysteretic . in what follows we therefore plot the average threshold @xmath25 , obtained upon increasing the drop size and variation of the flow rate .",
    "@xmath25 is determined as : @xmath26 .",
    "the error bar indicates the difference between the two measurement procedures .",
    "after measurement of @xmath23 the flow rate is further reduced which finally results in a sessile drop state again .",

    "[ fig : examplemodes]a ) and the drop size @xmath3 is determined as the maximum radius of the sessile drop in top view . to reduce as much as possible the influence of any possible airflow fluctuations coming from e.g. variations in the substrate or hydrophobic grid fixation , all data points are measured at a fixed position on the substrate . to study the influence of viscosity on the drop dynamics ,",
    "two liquids are used : water ( @xmath27 ) and water - glycerine mixture ( @xmath28 ) .",

    "this is reminiscent to the classical leidenfrost drops , levitated above a hot substrate @xcite . by varying the drop radius @xmath3 and airflow rate @xmath13 , the threshold for drop oscillations ( @xmath18,@xmath25 ) is determined .",

    "the open circles are oscillations without detachment from the needle . in these cases ,",
    "the size of the drop is measured in sessile state .",
    "the solid circles correspond to violent oscillations or a chimney , which can lead to the detachment from the needle .",

    "the smallest drops investigated here are stable up to very high flow rate , while the largest drops destabilize even at very small @xmath13 .",

    "a chimney instability is observed , for which an air bubble pierces through the center of the drop . such a chimney is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : breathing]b . the size of the drop could therefore only be determined from a drop in levitated state .    comparing the threshold of high viscosity drops with water drops",
    ", we observe a clear increase of the threshold .",
    "however , the dependence on viscosity is relatively weak , given that the liquid viscosity was increased by a factor of about 60 .",
    "by contrast , the dynamics are strongly affected by the liquid viscosity .",
    "while the oscillations of water drops at threshold is chaotic and non - axisymmetric , the viscous drops only display axisymmetric oscillations : we observe clear ` breathing ' modes ( symbol with error bars in fig .  [",
    "fig : examplemodes]b ) , for which the levitated drop remains circular in top view while oscillating .",
    "the large viscosity of the liquid drop apparently damps all higher mode oscillations and the formation of star - drops is completely suppressed . a more detailed picture illustrating this dynamics is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : breathing]a .",
    "consecutive snapshots ( top row ) all depict circular drops and a space - time diagram of the drop edge illustrates the radial oscillating motion .",
    "this regular dynamics make it relatively easy to measure the main oscillation frequency for all data along the threshold curve ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : frequency ] ) .",
    "note that in this measurement the frequency therefore is a function of @xmath41 .",
    "hence , small radius in this figure automatically also means relative large flow rate @xmath19 and vice versa ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : threshold ] ) .",
    "apart from this large contrast in shape deformations , also the measured oscillation frequencies are different from those measured with low - viscosity water drops .",
    "frequencies for high viscosity drops are considerably higher , by a factor two or more , than the lowest mode ( n=2 ) of the _ inviscid _ rayleigh & lamb frequency for a drop of the same size , but compare rather well with numerical results for axisymmetric oscillations of an ( inviscid ) drop on an air cushion ( see sections [ sec : numerical method ] and [ sec : numerical results ] ) .",
    "one possible interpretation is that the gas flow and the liquid flow act as a coupled dynamic system that oscillates . in case of water",
    "this oscillation , acting as a parametric forcing , directly leads to star oscillations which are well described by eq .",
    "[ eq : ray ] . however , viscosity affects or even suppresses star oscillations in high viscosity drops .",
    "as a result one essentially observes the frequency of this axisymmetric oscillation of the coupled system which in contrast to that of the star oscillations only weakly depends on drop size . in summary , due to the suppression of star oscillations viscous drops reveal the underlying axisymmetric oscillation from which the stars originate .",
    "it is this axisymmetric oscillation that we will study numerically in the next sections .",
    "finally , we again observe chimneys when the drop size becomes too large , @xmath42 mm ( see right panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : breathing ] ) .",
    "since the capillary length for the used water - glycerine mixture is , @xmath43 mm , the chimney occurs at about @xmath44 .",
    "this is consistent with earlier experiments on water drops  @xcite and theory  @xcite for which the critical radius @xmath45 ( @xmath46 for the water - glycerine mixture is indicated by the red dotted line in fig .  [ fig : threshold ] ) .",
    "we now investigate the dynamics of drops on an air cushion by numerical simulations .",
    "since previous work , where drops were modeled by stokes flow , did not result into any oscillation @xcite , inertia inside the drop must be important and we now consider the opposite limit : potential flow .",
    "the latter is coupled to a viscous airflow , modeled in the lubrication approximation .",
    "the model is similar to that in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was used for simulating drop impact .",
    "similar to the experiments , the main parameters that will be varied are the drop volume @xmath47 and the gas flow , here denoted by the upward gas velocity @xmath48 .",
    "other parameters are the gas viscosity @xmath49 ( lubrication approximation ) , liquid density @xmath5 ( potential flow ) , and the surface tension @xmath4 .",
    "these can be combined into three dimensionless numbers .",
    "a measure for defining the drop size is the bond number , @xmath50 , taking into account gravity influence against surface tension influence :    @xmath51    where @xmath52@xmath53@xmath54 is the radius of the unperturbed spherical drop with volume @xmath47 , and @xmath12 is the acceleration of gravity .",
    "@xmath34 is the capillary length , as defined in the introduction .",
    "secondly , we define the capillary number    @xmath55    in which @xmath48 is a constant if we assume a uniform upward flow beneath the drop .",
    "@xmath56 measures the influence of gas viscosity against surface tension and can be interpreted as the dimensionless gas velocity .",
    "by setting a balance between the viscous forces of the gas flow and the square root of the inertial forces induced by the drop times the surface tension force , we finally introduce a dimensionless quantity which we will call the ohnesorge number :    @xmath57    note that this definition of @xmath58 deviates from the standard definition , since it combines the viscosity of the gas and the density of the liquid .",
    "then , using @xmath34 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 as the relevant length , velocity and pressure scales , the radial positions @xmath61 , vertical positions @xmath62 , velocities @xmath63 , times @xmath64 , and pressures @xmath65 are non - dimensionalized as , respectively    @xmath66    from now on we will drop the tildes and all variables will be dimensionless , unless stated otherwise .",
    "the drop is assumed to consist of an incompressible and irrotational fluid , and can therefore be described by potential flow .",
    "the velocity field inside the drop is the gradient of a scalar velocity potential @xmath67 .",
    "the laplace equation ,    @xmath68    is valid throughout the whole drop including its surface contours .",
    "the boundary integral method is a way to solve this equation for @xmath67 , with the proper boundary conditions @xcite . for the levitated drop setup ,",
    "the entire drop surface is a free surface , and the dynamic boundary condition for that surface is the unsteady bernoulli equation :    @xmath69    where @xmath64 is time , @xmath70 is the absolute height , and @xmath71 is the local curvature at a point of the drop surface .",
    "the left - hand side describes the inertial effects of the drop , balanced by gravitational effects , the young - laplace pressure , and the influences by the airflow on the right - hand side .",
    "@xmath72 is the external pressure which is varying over the lower drop surface after introducing the gas flow . for this",
    ", the drop surface has been divided into two parts : the top of the drop where the surrounding pressure is atmospheric ; and the bottom of the drop , where we deal with the lubrication pressure induced by the gas flow . the separation point between these two parts",
    "is taken at @xmath73 , where @xmath3 is the topview radius , but results are unaffected by the precise location of the division @xcite .",
    "the gas flow is mainly determined by the viscosity of the gas ( stokes flow ) .",
    "we assume that @xmath74 .",

    "furthermore , at the free fluid - air - interface , @xmath80 , there is a kinematic boundary condition    @xmath81    which is the unsteady part of the problem setting . integrating the continuity equation ( [ eq : continuity_gas ] ) along @xmath70 ( between 0 and @xmath62 )",
    ", applying leibniz integral rule , substituting the boundary conditions , defining the average ( radial ) flow velocity @xmath82 , and multiplying the equation with @xmath61 gives @xcite    @xmath83    applying the stokes equation for this axisymmetric lubrication flow with zero velocity boundary conditions at @xmath70=0 and @xmath70=@xmath62 gives    @xmath84    in which @xmath72 is the pressure in the gas layer . combining ( [ applstokeseq ] ) and ( [ eq : massconservation ] ) , and performing one integration leads to    @xmath85    where    @xmath86    is the radius - dependent volume - airflux .",
    "the first term on the right - hand - side of ( [ eq : lubricationapproximation ] ) is the gas flow term ; the second term concerns the motion of the drop interface .",
    "@xmath87 is radially increasing , since the gas is accumulating beneath the drop .",
    "since viscous effects inside the drop are neglected , all motions ( waves , oscillations , vertical translations , ... ) will be undamped , as long as we do not apply any form of damping .",
    "indeed , simulations with realistic input parameters ( radius and airflow velocity ) lead to a quick blow up of surface wave amplitudes or the drop receiving a pressure pulse from below ( when @xmath62 becomes too small at some point ) .",
    "in particular , we were unable to produce any steady solutions without the implementation of damping .",
    "we therefore need to introduce a damping term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : unsteadybernoulliequation ] ) .",
    "we opted to follow a physically motivated way using ` viscous potential flow ' ( vpf ) @xcite .",

    "first , it is unclear to what extent the model represents a true viscous drop , since viscosity in general induces vorticity in the flow , which , of course , is absent in the simulation .",
    "it turned out that the liquid viscosity required to obtain stable numerical solutions is quite large , about 100 times the viscosity of water .",
    "consequently , we will treat @xmath91 as a numerical damping constant , rather than a physical viscous effect of the liquid .",
    "secondly , for too large damping , this method amplifies numerical deviations in the code : the normal stress term contains numerical approximations to derivatives , which are now multiplied by a large factor . summarizing , both requirements together set a narrow window for our liquid viscosity :    @xmath92    outside this range we were unable to generate reliable and stable numerical results .      in the numerical process ,",
    "the laplace equation is solved every time step , similar to ref .",
    "the size of a time step varies over the simulation , and depends on the instantaneous drop dynamics .",
    "the time step is small enough to prevent neighboring nodes from crossing each other . for a steady drop , or a falling drop ,",
    "the time step may be of order 0.001 time units ( typically of order @xmath93 ) , while an oscillatory scenario , with strong curvatures and large nodal velocities , could end up with time steps of order @xmath94 .    in general ,",
    "the simulation is initiated by a spherical drop falling from small starting height in the order of 0.10 capillary length .",
    "however , close to the chimney instability ( see subsection [ subsec : steady shapes and chimneys ] ) , it is necessary to start with a more ` gentle ' initial shape ( i.e. closer to the expected ` leidenfrost ' shape for these kind of drop sizes ) , such that the drop does not get unstable due to the impact of the drop after the free fall .",
    "the drop contour is characterized by @xmath61 and @xmath70 for @xmath95 . for the initial spherical drop ( in the first time steps of the simulation ) , this surface line consists of about 60 nodes , depending on the size of the drop ( a smaller drop results in a smaller number of nodes ) .",
    "the number of nodes will vary during the simulation , set by the ( maximum ) local curvatures on the line and the closeness to the symmetry - axis @xmath61=0 ; the largest node density is set around the bottom and top center of the drop .",

    "the observed frequencies appear to be independent of the damping factor .",
    "the frequencies extracted from numerics are compared to those measured experimentally on axisymmetric oscillations for highly viscous drops : the agreement is good for the large radii ( @xmath3 from 5 to 7 mm ) , but there are some discrepancies for smaller drop radius . to understand this overestimation from numerics , it should be pointed out that the magnitude of oscillations can be much larger in experiments than in numerics .",
    "non - linear effects at finite amplitude generally lead to a decrease of the response frequency of drops @xcite , which is especially prevalent for small drops .",
    "in this paper we investigated the dynamics of drops levitated by a gas cushion with constant and uniform influx .",
    "various dynamics are observed , both in experiments and numerics : drops either exhibit stable shapes , oscillate , or , undergo a ` chimney ' instability in which the gas pocket breaks through the center of the drop .",
    "our experimental results show that for both high - viscosity and low - viscosity drops , the threshold flow rate for oscillatory instability continuously increases when decreasing the drop size . at very low @xmath13",
    ", we do not reach the oscillatory state , since there is a maximum drop size beyond which the chimney instability sets in , as predicted by snoeijer et al .",
    "the trends are very similar for both viscosities , but the threshold is slightly higher at high viscosity .",
    "this dependence on viscosity is relatively weak in our experiments ; whereas the viscosity was increased by a factor 60 , the threshold flow rate only increased by less than 50% . by contrast , the drop dynamics _ are _ strongly influenced by viscosity .",
    "non - axisymmetric modes and chaotic oscillations could be observed near the threshold in oscillating water drops , while in the high viscosity case , _ only _ the ` breathing ' mode is observed . from this observation",
    "we infer that axisymmetric modes rather than the breaking of the azimuthal symmetry constitute the origin of the spontaneous appearance of oscillations .",
    "all these features have been reproduced numerically , by coupling inviscid boundary integral code for the drop to a viscous lubrication model for the gas flow . because potential flow without any damping was unstable in the interesting time range for the evolution of drop oscillations , an artificial damping needed to be introduced , which enabled the observation of both stable drop shapes and oscillations .",
    "the idea of a coupling between potential flow liquid and stokes gas flow proved to be very useful to study the equilibrium shapes of leidenfrost drops and deforming dynamics of these drops , or ( the dimple formation of ) impacting drops at room temperature @xcite and impacting evaporating drops .",
    "interestingly , for the impacting drop simulations , no damping needed to be involved ( because the time range in which we are interested was much shorter )",
    ".    in the numerical simulations of leidenfrost drops it is observed that , within a certain range of the parameter space , initially stable ( steady ) drop shapes gradually start to oscillate . frequencies of the oscillations are in reasonable agreement with experimental results , especially for large drops .",
    "the most important difference between our numerics and the experiments is that the threshold strongly depends on the amount of damping , and that the threshold velocity lies an order of magnitude away from the experimental one .",
    "therefore , a more realistic way of damping needs to be implemented to investigate the position of the threshold .    in both experiments and simulations , the air is injected from below .",
    "this is different from leidenfrost drops , which float on their own vapor , but their dynamics are very similar .",
    "hence , it is verified that the phenomenon of star oscillations does not require any thermal driving , contrarily to previous suggestions @xcite .",
    "this confirms the preliminary experimental observation  @xcite that the origin of drop oscillations are purely governed by fluid dynamics .",
    "the picture that emerges is that the oscillations appear due to an instability of the coupled system of the lubricating gas flow and the deformable drop . in the experiments , once the oscillations appear , ` stars ' naturally develop as a parametric instability for low - viscosity drops , in a way similar to water drops placed on an oscillating plate  @xcite . at higher viscosity ,",
    "the star formation is suppressed by viscous damping and only axisymmetric modes appear .",
    "this is similar for the onset of faraday waves , induced by periodic forcing of a horizontal free - surface @xcite .",
    "indeed , a large viscosity suppresses the appearance of the parametric instability that leads to faraday waves .",
    "therefore , this confirms that faceted star shapes are a result of parametric excitation that can only appear at sufficiently small damping ( i.e. liquid viscosity ) .",
    "though the exact mechanism that leads to oscillations remains to be explained , our study unveiled interesting clues to understand the phenomenon and could dismiss other mechanisms .",
    "interestingly , the reynolds number for the high viscosity drops in experiments is relatively small @xmath112 ( where we estimate the oscillation amplitude as 10@xmath113 of @xmath3 ) and still spontaneous oscillations are observed above a threshold radius and gas flow rate .",
    "previous numerical simulations based on stokes flow for both the drop and the gas displayed no oscillations @xcite .",
    "this raises the question of whether oscillations indeed cease to exist when further reducing the reynolds number , i.e. by increasing the liquid viscosity . it will be a challenge to investigate this regime experimentally due to practical difficulties of working with such a highly viscous liquid . other valuable information could also be provided by flow visualization inside the drop and the gas , since the results suggest a crucial coupling between the drop flow and the gas flow .",
