    "at ultra low temperature , massive bosons could occupy the same lowest - energy state and form the so - called bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) .",
    "this phenomenon was predicted by bose and einstein in 1925 , and was first realized on several alkali atomic gases in 1995 by laser cooling technique @xcite . in early experiments ,",
    "the atoms were confined in magnetic traps . in this situation",
    "the spin degrees of freedom are frozen . through the mean - field approximation",
    "the system is then described by a scalar wave function , which satisfies the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in an optically trapped atomic bec all hyperfine spin states can be active simultaneously , and a spin-@xmath1 bec is then described by a vector wave function @xmath2 , where the @xmath3-th component corresponds to the @xmath4 hyperfine state @xcite .",
    "the theory of such spinor bec was first developed independently by several groups @xcite .",
    "after these early studies , spinor bec has become an area of great research interest .      for a spin-@xmath5 bec , the vector wave function @xmath6 satisfies a generalized gp equation : @xmath7 where the hamiltonian is given by @xmath8 : = \\int_d\\bigg\\ {   { \\frac}{\\hbar^2}{2m_a}\\sum_j|{\\nabla}\\psi_j|^2 + v(x)|\\psi|^2 + { \\frac}{c_n}{2}|\\psi|^4 +   { \\frac}{c_s}{2}{\\left}|\\psi^{*}s \\psi{\\right}|^2   \\bigg\\}dx.\\ ] ] here @xmath9 is a domain in @xmath10",

    "the parameter @xmath24 characterizes the spin - independent interaction , and the parameter @xmath25 characterizes the spin - exchange interaction . for @xmath30 ( resp .",
    "@xmath31 ) , the spin - independent interaction is attractive ( resp .",
    "repulsive ) . for @xmath32 ( resp .",
    "@xmath33 ) , the spin - exchange interaction is ferromagnetic ( resp .",
    "antiferromagnetic ) .",
    "typical examples of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems are @xmath34rb and @xmath35na condensates .",
    "the generalized gp equation ( [ ggp ] ) implies two conserved quantities : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the total number of atoms and @xmath38 is the total magnetization . for the system to be nontrivial , we assume @xmath39 .",
    "we also assume @xmath40 ( note that obviously @xmath41 ) , for if @xmath42 the system reduces to a single component bec , which is a trivial case for all considerations in this work .",
    "now we say @xmath15 is a ground state if it is a minimizer of @xmath43 under the above two constraints .      in researches concerning ground states of spin-1 bec ,",
    "the following ansatz was often adopted : @xmath44 where @xmath45 are constants and @xmath46 is a function independent of @xmath3 .",
    "this is called the single - mode approximation ( sma ) in the physics literature @xcite .",
    "it has been found @xcite from numerical simulations that ground states obey the sma exactly for ferromagnetic systems ( and does not in general for antiferromagnetic ones ) , and hence can effectively be characterized as one - component systems .",
    "the first goal of this paper is to analytically confirm this observation . on the other hand , for antiferromagnetic systems , we will show that @xmath47 when @xmath48 , another well - known phenomenon from numerical simulations @xcite not being rigorously proved before .",
    "for the degenerate case @xmath49 , however , the sma is again valid while ground states are not unique , and @xmath50 does not necessarily vanish .",
    "it s interesting that although the two phenomena ( sma and vanishing of @xmath50 ) look quite irrelevant to each other , they can be proved by the same simple principle , that a redistribution of masses between different components will decrease the kinetic energy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 is the preliminary , where we reformulate the mathematical model more precisely , and then provide a result of maximum principle which is crucial in justifying the expected characterizations . in section 2.2 the idea of mass redistribution",
    "is introduced .",
    "sections 3 and 4 treat respectively the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems .",
    "for notational simplicity , let s redefine @xmath8=\\int_d\\bigg\\ { \\sum_j|{\\nabla}\\psi_j|^2 + v|\\psi|^2 + c_n|\\psi|^4 + c_s|\\psi^{*}s\\psi|^2 \\bigg\\}.\\ ] ] this causes no loss of generality for the phenomena we are going to investigate .",
    "the admissible class is @xmath51 where @xmath52 consists of all functions @xmath53 such that @xmath54 .",
    "let @xmath55 denotes @xmath56 .",
    "we also define @xmath57 let s also use @xmath58 to denote @xmath59 , so @xmath60 can be abbreviated as @xmath61 .    in section 2.1 ,",
    "we introduce a common reduction which shows that to study ground states we can simply consider @xmath62 instead of @xmath63 .",
    "indeed , @xmath62 consists just the amplitudes of elements in @xmath63 . and @xmath64 ( resp .",
    "@xmath65 ) corresponds to the set of all elements obeying the sma ( resp . with vanishing zeroth components ) . for the moment",
    ", we do not consider any boundary condition for simplicity .",
    "see the remark in the end of section 3 .      given @xmath66 .",
    "let @xmath67 be the polar form of @xmath68 .",
    "it s easy to check that if @xmath15 is a ground state , that is @xmath15 minimizes @xmath43 over @xmath63 , then the @xmath69 s are constants satisfying @xmath70 and @xmath71 = \\int_d\\bigg\\{\\sum_j|{\\nabla}u_j|^2 + v|{\\mathbf}{u}|^2 + c_n|{\\mathbf}{u}|^4   + c_s \\big [ 2u_0 ^ 2(u_1\\pm u_{-1})^2 + ( u_1 ^ 2-u_{-1}^2)^2\\big]\\bigg\\},\\ ] ] where the plus - minus sign @xmath72 corresponds to @xmath73 .",

    "we shall denote the set of all minimizers of @xmath80 over @xmath62 by @xmath84 .",
    "the euler - lagrange system for @xmath85 is given by the following coupled gross - pitaevskii equations : @xmath86\\\\ \\mu u_0                 & = { \\mathcal}{l}u_0 + 2c_s u_0 ( u_1\\pm u_{-1})^2\\\\ ( \\mu - \\lambda ) u_{-1 } & = { \\mathcal}{l}u_{-1 } + 2c_s{\\left}[u_0 ^ 2(u_{-1}\\pm u_1)+u_{-1}(u_{-1}^2-u_1 ^ 2){\\right } ] , \\end{aligned}{\\right}.\\ ] ] where @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the lagrange multipliers .",
    "we remark that in this paper we do not involve ourselves in the problem of existence .",
    "to best illustrate the simplicity of our method , we just assume there is a ground state .",
    "( see @xcite for related concerns of existence problem ) .",
    "also note that @xmath85 is continuously differentiable by standard regularity theorem ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the following lemma will be crucial in our characterizations of ground states .",
    "[ lemma ] if @xmath85 , then for each @xmath3 , either @xmath90 or @xmath91 on all of @xmath9 .    for an arbitrary compact @xmath92 , by subtracting respectively @xmath93 , @xmath94 , from the three equations in ( [ eleq ] ) with large enough constants @xmath95 , and using the assumption @xmath96 ,",
    "it s easy to verify that each @xmath97 satisfies @xmath98 for some @xmath99 on @xmath100 .",
    "thus either @xmath91 or @xmath90 on @xmath100 by strong maximum principle . since @xmath92 is arbitrary , the assertion of the lemma holds .      consider an @xmath101-tuple of nonnegative functions @xmath102 .",
    "let @xmath103 .",
    "it s well - known that @xmath104 .",
    "in fact , direct computation gives @xmath105 in particular , @xmath106 if and only if @xmath107 for @xmath108 .",
    "the property above has a simple while interesting generalization , when @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) do not sum to a single @xmath111 , but instead are redistributed into multiple parts . to be precise , we give the following definition .",
    "[ mr ] let @xmath112 be as above , and let @xmath113 be an @xmath114-tuple of nonnegative functions .",
    "we say @xmath115 is a mass redistribution of @xmath112 if @xmath116 for each @xmath117 , where @xmath118 are nonnegative constants satisfying @xmath119 , for each @xmath120 .",
    "note that @xmath103 is the only mass redistribution of @xmath112 with @xmath121 .",
    "in general we have the following proposition .    [ prop2.2 ] for any mass redistribution @xmath115 of @xmath112 as in , we have    * @xmath122 * @xmath123 .",
    "equality holds if and only if @xmath124 for each @xmath108 with @xmath125 for at least one @xmath126 .",
    "the first assertion follows directly from the definition of redistribution . for ( 2 ) , from ( [ equal ] ) we have @xmath127 and the assertion is obtained by summing over all @xmath126 .    in this work",
    ", we will consider mass redistributions of @xmath77 .",
    "since the square of the amplitude of a wave function represents its mass distribution , we use the adjective `` mass '' to stress that it s a redistribution of the squares - th power redistribution , which may be useful in studying systems with @xmath128-laplacian terms . ] . to save notation ,",
    "in the following we shall omit it and simply say `` redistribution '' . note that if @xmath77 and @xmath129 is a redistribution of @xmath55 , then from ( 1 ) of proposition [ prop2.2 ] , @xmath130 satisfies ( c1 ) automatically and @xmath131 .",
    "these facts together with ( 2 ) of the proposition allow us to give unified and simple justifications of the two properties mentioned in the introduction .",
    "in this section we assume @xmath132 , and the goal is to prove the validity of sma .",
    "that is we want to show @xmath133 .",
    "the idea is to find , for @xmath77 , a redistribution of @xmath55 in @xmath64 that has no larger energy than @xmath55 , and then try to conclude that @xmath55 must itself be the redistributed element provided @xmath85 .",
    "now given any @xmath77 .",
    "it s easy to see that a redistribution of @xmath55 in @xmath64 can be expressed as @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is any triple of nonnegative constants satisfying @xmath136 let @xmath137 denote the set containing all such @xmath58 : @xmath138 then @xmath139 for each @xmath140 . on the other hand , @xmath141 where @xmath142 since @xmath132 , @xmath143 and it s easy to check that @xmath144 where the maximizer @xmath145 is unique and is given by @xmath146 on the other hand , we already know @xmath147 .",
    "thus we have proved @xmath148 for any @xmath149 .",
    "we can now prove the first characterization of ground states by examining the condition for equality of ( [ lem1 ] ) .",

    "if @xmath85 , we must have @xmath75={\\mathbb}{e}[{\\boldsymbol}{{\\gamma}}^{\\star}|{\\mathbf}{u}|]$ ] , which implies @xmath152 , and hence @xmath153 since we assume the total number of atoms @xmath154 , from lemma [ lemma ] at least one @xmath97 is strictly positive in @xmath9 .",
    "assume @xmath155 on @xmath9 .",
    "then from ( [ 15 ] ) we have @xmath156 since @xmath9 is connected , ( [ ezero ] ) implies @xmath157 and @xmath158 are both constant multiples of @xmath159 .",
    "this shows @xmath160 , and ( ii ) follows either by ( [ 16 ] ) or by the fact that @xmath161 is the unique maximizer of @xmath162 over @xmath137 .",
    "the case @xmath163 and @xmath164 can be proved similarly .",
    "the above theorem implies that searching for ground states of ferromagnetic spin-1 bec can be reduced to a `` one - component '' minimization problem .",

    "in particular , in case that a homogeneous boundary condition ( e.g. homogeneous dirichlet or neumann boundary condition ) is considered , the induced boundary condition for @xmath179 is also homogeneous of the same kind , and theorem [ thm1 ] ( and hence corollary [ cor3.2 ] ) remains valid .",
    "the main focus of this section is the phenomenon @xmath180 . after justifying it in section 4.1 ,",
    "some degenerate situations are also discussed in section 4.2 .",
    "assume @xmath181 in this subsection .",
    "we want to show that any ground state must have a vanishing zeroth component , and hence is a two - component bec .",
    "similar to the approach in the previous section , we want to find an appropriate redistribution @xmath182 of @xmath77 so that @xmath183\\le{\\mathbb}{e}[{\\mathbf}{u}]$ ] .",
    "now , not as before , the assumption @xmath182 does nt give rise to a definite candidate of @xmath184 .",
    "in view that such @xmath184 satisfies @xmath185 and hence ( c1 ) , as a guess , we try imposing the additional assumption that @xmath184 also satisfies @xmath186 so that ( c2 ) is also satisfied by @xmath184 automatically .",
    "this results in only one possibility , that is @xmath187 for any @xmath149 , we then let @xmath182 be its redistribution defined by .",
    "it s fortunate that it works .",
    "in fact , @xmath188 and we have the following analogue of theorem [ thm1 ] .",
    "assume @xmath85 . from ( [ lem2 ] ) , @xmath75={\\mathbb}{e}[{\\widetilde}{{\\mathbf}{u}}]$ ] , and @xmath190 by lemma [ lemma ]",

    "the requirement @xmath48 in theorem [ thm2 ] is necessary .",
    "in fact , for @xmath49 , sma is again valid while ground states are not unique , and @xmath191 is not necessarily the case .",
    "precisely , consider the minimization problem ( recall that @xmath193 is defined by ( [ sing ] ) ) @xmath194 and we have the following characterization .      note that since @xmath49 , from ( [ adconst ] ) , @xmath140 implies @xmath198.\\ ] ] now it s easy to see that for any @xmath77 and @xmath140 we have @xmath199 which satisfies @xmath200 by proposition [ prop2.2 ] , and the remaining of the proof is the same as in section 3 .",
