    "one of the most striking and general consequences of spontaneous symmetry breaking is the existence of gapless modes , guaranteed by the celebrated goldstone theorem @xcite . the number and properties of the goldstone bosons are crucial for the low - energy dynamics ( and the low - temperature thermodynamics ) of the system . in particular",
    ", these soft modes play a  major role in transport phenomena such as heat conductivity or viscosity .",
    "it has been known for a  long time that the physics of spontaneous symmetry breaking in lorentz - noninvariant systems may be quite intricate . the fundamental result in this respect",
    "was achieved by nielsen and chadha @xcite : they showed in a nonperturbative manner that , under certain technical assumptions , the energy of the goldstone bosons stemming from the spontaneous symmetry breaking is , in the long - wavelength limit , proportional to some power of momentum .",
    "the goldstone bosons are then classified as type - i , if this power is odd , and type - ii , if it is even , respectively .",
    "the numbers of the goldstone bosons of the respective types are related to the number of broken symmetry generators by the following inequality , @xmath1    eq .",
    "shows that whenever there is a type - ii goldstone boson , the number of goldstone bosons may be smaller than the number of broken generators .",
    "a  profound example of a  system where this happens is provided by the ferromagnet . in the past decade , however , several other systems with type - ii goldstone bosons have been studied , ranging from various high - density phases of qcd @xcite and the relativistic nuclear ferromagnet @xcite to bose  einstein condensed atomic gases @xcite and the general effect of relativistic vector condensation @xcite .    in our recent paper @xcite we investigated the goldstone boson counting in a  particular class of lorentz - noninvariant systems  the relativistic linear sigma model at finite chemical potential .",
    "based on previous partial results @xcite we clarified the connection of goldstone boson counting with the possibility of nonzero densities of noether charges and conjectured a  general counting rule : _ non - zero density of a  commutator of two broken generators implies one type - ii goldstone boson with a  quadratic dispersion law_. as a consequence , the inequality is saturated , up to exceptional cases like the phase transitions , where the phase velocity of a type - i goldstone boson may vanish , thus making it an ` accidental ' type - ii one . within the linear sigma model , we were able to give a detailed proof of these statements .",

    "the present paper is intended to fill this gap .",

    ", it has no effect on the spectrum in the normal phase , while in the bose ",
    "einstein condensed phase it merely serves to stabilize the scalar field potential .",
    "second , the loop corrections may play a  significant role , especially in the vicinity of the phase transition , where the classical analysis can not be trusted .",
    "third , it is well known that when the static part of the lagrangian has higher symmetry than the full lagrangian , the tree level is not sufficient to determine the spectrum ( even qualitatively ) correctly @xcite .",
