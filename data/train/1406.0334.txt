    "high - mass stars are much less frequent than intermediate- or low - mass stars due to both the star formation process , which gives rise to an initial mass function declining with the mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and to their shorter evolutionary times . however , high - mass stars are very important because they can affect their surroundings with their winds , their strong radiation fields , and their catastrophic death as supernovae , chemically enriching their environment and triggering star formation .",
    "they usually form within the dense cores of stellar clusters and/or associations where dynamical interactions play an important role .",
    "it is widely believed that massive stars may be the product of collisions between two or more intermediate - mass stars .",
    "this idea is supported by the fact that a large fraction of massive stars harbour close companions , as failed mergers .",
    "it has been recently estimated that at least 50% of massive stars are member of binary or multiple star system @xcite .",
    "this lucky occurrence allows to directly measure the masses by means of their radial velocity ( rv ) curves . in many cases , spectral lines of both components",
    "are visible ( sb2 systems ) , allowing to derive the orbital parameters like the period , @xmath5 , the projected semi - major axes , @xmath6 , and the masses , @xmath7 , apart from the factor @xmath8 .",
    "if our line - of - sight is close to the orbital plane and fractional radii of the components are not too small the stars display mutually eclipses . the orbital inclination and fractional radii of the component stars can be determined by the analysis of photometric light curves .",
    "therefore , eclipsing binaries are unique targets for determining the masses and radii from their combined light curves and radial velocities analyses .",
    "nevertheless , absolute radii were measured only for a rather small number of early - type b - stars which are members of eclipsing binary systems @xcite .",
    "thus , we started a systematic observing program devoted to the spectroscopic study of close eclipsing binary systems with at least one hot component .",
    "the eclipsing character of v1441aquilae ( hd 177624 ; bd+09@xmath93979 ; hip 93732 ; v=6.90 , b - v=0.19 mag ) was discovered by the @xmath10 satellite mission @xcite , the primary eclipse having an amplitude of 0.09mag .",
    "the depth of the secondary minimum is nearly half of the primary one .",
    "v1441aql was first recognized as a double - lined spectroscopic binary by @xcite .",
    "they classified it as a b3v star with semi - amplitudes of radial velocities of about 82 and 196 kms@xmath11 .",
    "the first eclipse light curve ( lc ) was roughly revealed by the @xmath10 observations . @xcite",
    "designated it as v1441aql in the 74th name - list of variable stars , and classified it as an eb . in recent years",
    ", large - scale photometric surveys such as all sky automated survey ( asas , @xcite ) have been conducted with the main aim of looking for transiting exoplanets .",
    "the valuable by - product of these searches has been the very large number of well sampled eclipsing binary lcs .",
    "one of the eclipsing binaries observed at the las campanas observatory as part of the asas was v1441aql .",
    "although the phase coverage is very good the photometric accuracy of the observations is only around 0.05 mag .",
    "the orbital period of v1441aql was determined from the spectroscopic observations as 2.374148 days by @xcite .",
    "the first photometric observations of the system were made by the @xmath10 mission and an orbital period of about 2.374 days was estimated @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 photometry permits a redetermination of the orbital period of the system . a periodogram analysis performed with period04 @xcite , which was applied to all the data obtained by @xmath0 .",
    "we derive the following ephemeris    @xmath12    where the standard deviations in the last significant digits are given in parentheses .",
    "optical spectroscopic observations of v1441aql was obtained at the tubitak national observatory using the turkish faint object spectrograph camera ( tfosc ) attached to the 1.5 m telescope .",
    "the observations were made from july 22 , 2012 to august 3 , 2013 , under good seeing conditions .",
    "further details on the telescope and the spectrograph can be found at http://www.tug.tubitak.gov.tr .",
    "the wavelength coverage of each spectrum was 4000 - 9000   in 11 orders , with a resolving power of @xmath13/@xmath14 @xmath157000 at 6500  . the average signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) was @xmath15120 .",
    "we also obtained high s / n spectra of early type standard stars 1cas ( b0.5iv ) , hr153 ( b2iv ) , @xmath16her ( b5iv ) , 21peg ( b9.5v ) and @xmath17lyr ( a0v ) which were used as templates in derivation of the radial velocities .",
    "the echelle spectra were extracted from the raw images following standard reduction steps involving electronic bias subtraction , flat field division , cosmic rays removal , optimal extraction of the echelle orders , and wavelength calibration thanks to the emission lines of a th - ar lamp .",
    "the reduction was performed using tasks of the iraf package",
    "the time - resolved spectroscopic dataset consists of 17 observations for v1441aql .",
    "we have measured radial velocities ( rvs ) from the spectra , focusing on spectral segments containing the hei @xmath135876 ( order4 ) and @xmath136678 ( order3 ) lines which are the most prominent un - blended features in our spectra , apart from the balmer lines .",
    "we have employed the standard cross - correlation method for measuring the velocities of the component stars of the systems .",
    "the numerical cross - correlation technique @xcite is a standard approach for measuring rvs from the spectra of close binary systems .",
    "cross - correlation analyses were made using the spectra of @xmath16her and 21peg as templates .",
    "the principle spectral features showing splitting due to binarity were the hei lines at @xmath185876 and 6678 .",
    "we used also order 9 , containing the hei @xmath134471 line , for a few measurements of the radial velocities .",
    "the spectra taken close to the conjunctions , which display no double - lined feature , were disregarded .",
    "the balmer lines were not used in the measurements of radial velocities due to their extremely broad profiles .",
    "we obtained 17 radial velocities for each component of v1441aql .",
    "the average radial velocities and their associated standard errors derived from the spectral segments containing hei @xmath184471 , 5876 , and 6678 lines are presented in table1 , along with the observation date and orbital phase .",
    "the mean error of radial velocities is 3.6kms@xmath11 for the primary , and 8.5 kms@xmath11 for the secondary star of v1441aql .",
    "the rvs are plotted against the orbital phase in fig.1 , where the filled squares represent the primaries and the empty squares the secondaries , respectively .",
    "examination of the @xmath0 light curve show no evidence for any eccentricity in the orbits of both systems .",
    "therefore , we have assumed circular orbits and analysed the rvs using the rvsim software programme @xcite .",
    "final orbital parameters are presented in table2 .",
    "intermediate - resolution optical spectroscopy permits us to derive most of the fundamental stellar parameters , such as the projected rotational velocity ( @xmath19 ) , spectral type ( s@xmath1 ) , luminosity class , effective temperature ( @xmath20 ) , surface gravity ( @xmath21 ) , and metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) .",
    "the width of the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) is a good tool for the measurement of projected rotational velocity ( @xmath22 ) of a star .",
    "we use a method developed by @xcite to estimate the @xmath22 of each star composing the investigated sb2 systems from its ccf peak by a proper calibration based on a spectrum of a narrow - lined star with a similar spectral type . per each system",
    ", the rotational velocities of the components were obtained by measuring the fwhm of the ccf peak related to each component in five high - s / n spectra acquired near the quadratures , where the spectral lines have the largest doppler - shift .",
    "the ccfs were used for the determination of @xmath19 through a calibration of the full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the ccf peak as a function of the @xmath19 of artificially broadened spectra of slowly rotating standard star ( 21peg , @xmath2314 kms@xmath11 , e.g. , @xcite ) acquired with the same setup and in the same observing night as the targets systems .",
    "the limb darkening coefficient was fixed at the theoretically predicted values , 0.42 for both systems @xcite .",
    "we calibrated the relationship between the ccf gaussian width and @xmath19 using the @xcite data sample .",
    "this analysis yielded projected rotational velocities for the components of v1441aql as @xmath24=196  kms@xmath11 , and @xmath25  kms@xmath11 .",
    "the mean deviations were 4 and 7 kms@xmath11 , for the primary and secondary , respectively , between the measured velocities for different lines .",
    ".heliocentric radial velocities of v1441aql .",
    "the columns give the heliocentric julian date , orbital phase and the radial velocities of the two components with the corresponding standard deviations . [ cols=\"^,^,>,^,>,^,^ \" , ]",
    "v1441aql is close eclipsing binaries containing high - mass stars .",
    "we carried out spectroscopic observations of system .",
    "the atmospheric parameters of the components in the eclipsing pairs have been determined from their spectra .",
    "the spectra were analyzed using cross - correlation for measuring the radial velocities of both components and with an ad - hoc code for deriving their atmospheric parameters .",
    "moreover , the @xmath0 and @xmath26 light curves were modeled using the wd code .",
    "the physical parameters for the system is measured to accuracies of 6 - 7% in mass , and 5% in radius .",
    "v1441aql seems to a double - contact system with asynchronously - rotating components .",
    "the distances to the systems v1441aql is estimated as 550@xmath225pc . a comparison of physical parameters of the components with the theoretical models of single stellar evolution models has been made .",
    "an age of about 30 myr is estimated for v1441aql .",
