    "as it is well known , the quark helicity takes into account at most one third of the proton spin .",
    "this motivates the great effort on both experimental and theoretical sides to accurately determine the contributions from the quark orbital angular momentum ( @xmath1 ) and from the gluons .",
    "analogous efforts are carried out to study the neutron . in view of this , the investigations of reactions like the electron semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) by a polarized @xmath0he target play a very relevant role @xcite . such processes yield information on the so - called transverse - momentum distributions ( tmd ) of a polarized quark inside a polarized neutron , such that an unprecedented amount of details on the quark dynamics inside the neutron can be achieved . our aim @xcite is to extend a previous analysis of sidis by polarized @xmath0he target @xcite , that addressed the extraction of the neutron single - spin asymmetries ( ssas ) , within a plane wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) framework and in the bjorken limit .",
    "one can improve such an approach by : i ) dealing with the relativistic effects through a poincar covariant description of the nuclear dynamics ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and ii ) taking into account the final state interaction ( fsi ) by adopting @xcite the so - called generalized eikonal approach ( gea ) ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a polarized @xmath0he nucleus is an ideal target to study the neutron , since at a 90% level it is equivalent to a polarized neutron . for disentangling the nucleon structure from the dynamical nuclear effects",
    ", one can adopt an approach based on the spin - dependent spectral function of @xmath0he , @xmath2 , ( see , e.g. @xcite ) that yields the probability distribution to find a nucleon with given missing energy , three - momentum and polarization inside the nucleus . by using this formalism",
    ", one can safely extract @xcite the neutron longitudinal asymmetry , @xmath3 , from the corresponding @xmath0he observable , @xmath4 , obtained from the reaction @xmath5 in dis regime , i.e. ( a^exp_3 - 2 p_p f_p a^exp_p ) /(p_n",

    ". realistic values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 are @xmath10 , @xmath11 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in @xcite ,",
    "an analogous extraction was applied to the ssa of a transversely polarized @xmath12 target , obtained from the process @xmath13 , in order to obtain the ssa of a transversely polarized neutron . in pwia and adopting the bjorken limit , the ssas of @xmath14 are a convolution of @xmath15 , and the nucleon ssas , that in turn are convolutions of suitable tmds and fragmentation functions , phenomenologically describing the hadronization of the hit quark . to improve the previous description , taking into account relativistic effects in the actual experimental kinematics and developing a poincar covariant framework for analyzing the ssa of @xmath0he , one can adopt the light - front ( lf ) relativistic hamiltonian dynamics ( rhd ) , combined with the bakamjian - thomas construction of the poincar generators .",
    "then , one gets the following expression for the @xmath0he hadronic tensor @xcite ( for details see @xcite ) _ ,  _ .. _ ^min_s^^max_s  d _ s _ m^2_n^(m_x - m_s)^2 dm^2_f _ _ l^_u d^2 ( 1-)(2)^3 _ p^m_^p^m_d p_sin   ( p^++q^+- h^+ )   w^_(,q , h , p ) p^_(,_s , s_he )",

    "the second ingredient to be added is gea ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein quoted ) , devised for taking into account the fsi effects .",
    "in particular , fsi effects to be considered are due to the propagation of the debris , formed after the @xmath23 absorption by a target quark , and the subsequent hadronization , both of them influenced by the presence of a fully - interacting @xmath24 spectator system .",
    "clearly , such fsi effects represent a very complicated many - body problem and their evaluation from first principles is a hard challenge .",
    "therefore it is necessary to develop model approaches for evaluating their impact on the extraction of neutron ssas .",
    "the approximation based on gea has been recently applied for describing the spectator sidis by a polarized @xmath0he target @xcite .",
    "the key quantities are the intrinsic overlaps defined as follows ^_a(fsi)_(*p*_n , e ) =   ( ^*_a-1 )   _ gl \\ { _ ^*_a-1,,*p*_n}| s_a , _ a s_a , _ a| _ gl\\ { _ ^*_a-1,,*p*_n }   ( e+ m_a - m_n - m^*_a-1-t_a-1 ) [ overlaps ] where i ) @xmath25 is the usual missing energy @xmath26 , with @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) the energy ( state density ) of the spectator system and @xmath29 the binding energy of the target nucleus , ii ) @xmath30 the three - momentum of the struck nucleon and iii ) @xmath31 represents the debris - nucleon eikonal scattering s - matrix , that depends upon the relative coordinates only , and it is given by @xmath32 $ ] , where @xmath33 is the perpendicular ( parallel ) component of @xmath34 ( remind that @xmath35 ) , with respect to the direction of the propagation of the debris @xmath36 . in the dis limit @xmath37 ( @xmath38 is the three - momentum transfer ) and the eikonal s - matrix is defined with respect to @xmath39 . the profile function , @xmath40 , is @xcite ( * b*_1i , z_1i ) =  , [ eikonal ] where @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , with @xmath44 the effective number of pions which are produced .",
    "indeed , the effective cross sections , @xmath45 depends also on the total energy of the debris , @xmath46 , but such a dependence is weak , if the energy is not too large and the hadronization process develops inside the nuclear environment . hence , the effective cross section can be approximated as @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "@xmath48    successful applications of gea to unpolarized sidis can be found in refs .",

    "( [ overlaps ] ) , in a poincar covariant framework can be achieved through a generalization of the relation shown in eq .",
    "( [ sfrhd ] ) @xcite .",
    "the impact of the fsi treatment can be appreciated by considering the following quantity , needed in the evaluation of sidis processes and strictly related to the nuclear dynamics , namely @xmath49 , viz _ ||(fsi)^12 ( * p*_n , e)=12   indeed , the evaluation was carried out for the spectator sidis , where a deuteron is detected in the final state .",
    "figure [ figsparperp ] illustrates the effects of fsi , evaluated within the gea , by showing the absolute value of @xmath50 , for the above mentioned spectator sidis , as a function of the missing momentum , @xmath51 , in both the parallel ( @xmath52 ) , and perpendicular ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) , kinematics .",
    "it is interesting to note that a wise choice of the kinematical variables can minimize the fsi effects , as already shown in the unpolarized case  @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ figsparperp ] , fsi is negligible at low values of @xmath55 ( in this case one has a fast final debris , given @xmath56 ) , while it starts to be sizable for @xmath57 , where the equal sign holds for the perpendicular kinematics ( cf the right panel ) .    to illustrate the influence of the fsi effects on the extraction procedures of the neutron information ,",
    "let us consider the preliminary comparison , for a jlab12 kinematics @xcite , between the pwia values of both dilution factors and nucleon polarizations that appear in eq .",
    "( [ dis ] ) and the corresponding calculations with fsi effects taken into account . as shown in table 1",
    ", fsi can sizably modify the overlaps given in eq .",
    "( [ overlaps ] ) , that are necessary for evaluating the quantities in eq .",
    "( [ dis ] ) .",
    "in particular , about a @xmath58 depolarization effect of the nucleons in @xmath59 is produced .",
    "it should be pointed that , even if both polarizations and dilution factors in eq .",
    "( [ dis ] ) are affected by the presence of fsi , fortunately their product does not .",
    "therefore the extraction procedure , can be safely applied .",
    "this seems a quite encouraging message , from the phenomenological point of view , and motivates the application of such an approach , combined with the the poincar covariant treatment of the nucleus tensor , to the extraction procedure of the neutron ssas from the @xmath59 ssas , to be considered elsewhere @xcite .",
