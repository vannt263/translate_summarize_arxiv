    "recent successes by deep near - infrared ( nir ) surveys such as the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; @xcite ) , the deep near - infrared survey ( denis ; @xcite ) , and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) in identifying very low - mass stellar and sub - stellar field candidates have made a tremendous impact upon the study of low - mass objects in the local stellar neighborhood .",

    "we desired an instrument that could rapidly provide identifying spectra for candidate low - mass objects identified by 2mass to within 1 - 2 spectral sub - classes . to accomplish this",
    "the instrument requires access to telltale l and t - dwarf identifying features in the red - optical such as crh and feh at @xmath19 , @xmath20 at @xmath21 , the feh feature at @xmath22 , as well as @xmath23 features at @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "other features important to nir classification include the k i resonance doublets at @xmath26 and @xmath27 , broad @xmath28 absorption features , and the co bandhead at @xmath29",
    ".    the instrument s resolution must be as low as possible to maximize signal from intrinsically faint low - mass objects , yet high enough to detect identifying features between blended airglow lines . since the airglow lines are most plentiful and intense in h - band , we chose the lowest resolution that retained the ability to observe the @xmath24 methane absorption feature between blended airglow lines , thus preserving the ability to identify this telltale t - dwarf spectral feature for the faintest objects",
    ".    observing efficiency was paramount if the instrument were to quickly identify large numbers of objects and select those that warranted higher resolution and s / n study on larger telescopes , especially given the large number of l - dwarfs expected to be found by surveys .",
    "this requirement favored a cross - dispersed spectrograph with its efficient 2-d spectral format .",
    "a nir slit viewing mode was deemed imperative for rapid field identification and for steering objects accurately into the slit .",
    "most science targets for this spectrograph have extreme visible - ir colors , i.e. cormass science targets tend to be visibly faint but ir bright .",
    "the choice of slit width was driven by the typical seeing at the palomar 60-inch of @xmath30 . to achieve nyquist sampling at @xmath31 , we chose a @xmath32 slit and a plate scale of @xmath33 .",
    "we desired the slit length to be as long as possible to sample the sky for accurate subtraction ( @xmath34 if possible ) , but left the final length to be determined by the optical design constraints .",
    "lastly , we wanted the instrument to have first light within one year of commencing design due to the rapidly progressing field of low - mass objects . for cost and schedule reasons we decided to modify an existing ir labs dewar and use an existing nicmos3 array and array electronics",
    "the palomar 60-inch telescope is an equatorial mounted @xmath35 ritchey - chrtien design @xcite .",
    "table [ tbl - sp ] includes the telescope prescription .",
    "cormass mounts directly to the instrument mounting plate at the cassegrain focus , as shown in figure [ casspix ] . with the exception of the primary and secondary mirrors and the dewar window all the optical elements",
    "are cooled to @xmath17 temperature .",
    "cormass features a compact design that was constrained by the existing dewar and the telescope focus position .",
    "the cormass dewar previously served as the 2mass prototype camera dewar and more recently for testing nicmos3 arrays for the 2mass survey .",
    "the original dewar is an infrared laboratories ( tucson , az ) nd-2(8)mod dewar with a 4.5 liter @xmath17 tank and double shielding .",
    "it has a usable cold instrument volume of 7.5 inches @xmath36 inches .",
    "it was clear that a dewar expansion was required to increase the cold volume available for the new spectrograph optics .",
    "clearly the simplest dewar modification would be a cylindrical extension of the dewar walls and shields .",
    "thus the new spectrograph was constrained to @xmath37 7.5 inches , with the length a ` free parameter . '",
    "the optimal telescope focus is only @xmath38 mm below the instrument mounting plate ( table [ tbl - sp ] ) .",
    "in addition , a permanently mounted offset guide camera and filter motor assembly on the telescope instrument mounting plate constrain the outer diameter of an instrument mounted flush to the plate to be @xmath39 inches .    these constraints on access",
    "made placement of a cold slit at the telescope focus difficult .",
    "the awkward focus position was good incentive to allow the beam to diverge past the telescope focus , enter the cryogenic dewar , and then re - image the beam onto a slit",
    ". such a scheme would provide straight - forward _ _",
    "f/__conversion between the telescope focus and slit , as well as produce a well - defined cold pupil stop .",
    "but a re - imaging scheme would further lengthen the cylindrical axis of the instrument , thus increasing expense , flexure and the moment arm of the instrument mass that must be compensated with telescope balance .",
    "we chose instead the more compact scheme of placing a cold slit at the telescope focus .",
    "this required a very tightly integrated mechanical design just inside the window : the dewar top plate , caf@xmath40 window , two radiation shield tops , and slit occupy a span of @xmath38 mm measured along the optical axis . _ _",

    "the slit width is oversized by @xmath50 to compensate for the disk rotation .    past the slit",
    "the beam is converted from @xmath35 to @xmath51 by an infrasil 301-caf@xmath40 air - spaced doublet and is collimated by a gold - coated , diamond - turned , aluminum alloy ( 6061-t6 ) off - axis paraboloid .",

    "was neatly returned into the main ` 2-d ' plane of the optical bench ( figures [ benchschematic ] - [ opticalpath ] ) .",
    "single - pass prism designs led to cubical mechanical packages that could not be simply inserted into the dewar . _    in addition to sf-10 various other prism materials were considered , including amtir1 and znse .",
    "both have higher dispersion in the nir than sf-10 but were rejected due to coating difficulty and expense .",

    "the measured internal transmission of sf-10 ( kindly provided by dr .",
    "e. oliva ) and expected anti - reflection ( ar ) coating performance ( janos technology , inc . ) are plotted in figure [ sf10trans ] .",
    "the transmission measurement was performed as described in @xcite and includes theoretical fresnel losses from two air - glass interfaces ( dashed line ) and internal transmission through one pass of a 21.7 mm uncoated sample ( dotted line ) .",
    "this is very close to the median length of sf-10 traversed by the cormass beam in one pass ( 20.7 mm ) , so the plotted transmission , neglecting fresnel losses , accurately reflects the expected internal transmission in our instrument .",
    "shortward of @xmath55 the glass is nearly transparent .",
    "we assume absorption features longward of @xmath56 are due to water / oh in the glass . combining the expected reflection losses through two air - glass interfaces after ar coating ( long dashed line ) with the internal transmission gives the total expected transmission through one prism pass for cormass ( solid line ) . while the transmission losses were unfortunate , they were accepted because the primary spectral features in @xmath57-band for l and t - dwarfs , the co bandhead at @xmath29 and the @xmath25 @xmath23 feature , resp . , were deemed less important and redundant compared to the _ jh _ band features .",
    "following the first pass through the prism the beam is diffracted by the grating .",
    "richardson grating labs ( rochester , ny ) mounted an epoxy replica of a stock master grating onto an aluminum alloy ( 6061-t6 ) substrate provided by us . the gold coated grating , with 40 @xmath58 groove density and blazed at @xmath59 ,",

    "the detector images the 2nd through 9th orders , with coverage from @xmath63 to @xmath64 .",
    "we designed the spectrograph to use orders 2 - 5 and were fortunate that orders 6 - 7 are in good optical focus as well .",
    "in practice only 2nd through 6th orders have useful throughput .",
    "( spectrograph throughput is discussed in  6 ) .    inadvertently",
    "the shortward edge of order 2 and longward edge of order 3 are cutoff by the array edges , resulting in a gap in spectral coverage from @xmath65 - @xmath66 .",
    "evidently the final spectrograph camera focal length is too long , likely due to errors in our assumed cryogenic indices of refraction .",
    "grating efficiency is well described by scalar theory if @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the groove spacing ( @xmath69 for cormass ) . therefore , polarization effects are very small @xcite .",
    "theory also predicts @xmath70 efficiency from @xmath71 to @xmath72 in first order . at higher orders this efficiency will be maintained because the grating is used even farther into the scalar domain as @xmath73 decreases @xcite .",
    "a check of our chosen grating parameters in a commercial software program for grating efficiency analysis ( pc grate , optometrics , ayer , ma ) yields estimated peak efficiencies of 90% for orders 2 - 5 .",
    "after diffraction by the grating , the beam passes through the prism for a second time .",
    "lastly , the beam is focused onto the detector by an @xmath74 camera which delivers a final plate scale of @xmath75 to the @xmath76 square nicmos3 pixels .",
    "the camera features three elements in a doublet - singlet format . following a baf@xmath40-infrasil air - spaced doublet ,",
    "there is a space of @xmath77 inches before the converging beam passes through the final infrasil lens and focuses on the detector .",

    "the ratio of the telescope central obscuration diameter to primary diameter is @xmath79 . for a telescope with @xmath80",

    "this applies for the entire slit fov ( 2x 15 ) .",
    "the sf-10 prism in cormass leads to an order format similar to that found when a first order grating is used as the cross - disperser @xcite . ] ; cormass order separation increases with increasing wavelength ( figure [ fpaimages ] ) , whereas prism cross - dispersers typically give larger order separation for decreasing wavelength .",
    "the cormass format occurs because the dispersion of sf-10 in the near - infrared does not follow the usual dispersion law for transparent glasses in the optical , @xmath82 . instead of a monotonically decreasing dispersion with increasing wavelength",
    ", sf-10 has a dispersion minimum at @xmath83 ( figure [ dispersionfig ] ) at room temperature .",
    "this leads to theoretical relative order separations also shown in figure [ dispersionfig ] .",
    "both plots compare sf-10 and znse .",
    "sf-10 has a similar dispersion function at 77k as at room temperature .      complementing the spectrograph optical train is a slit viewing mode ( figure [ opticalpath ] ) .",
    "light not transmitted through the slit is reflected by the polished slit substrate into the secondary slit viewing train .",
    "this allows viewing a @xmath3 image of the reflective slit for rapidly steering science targets into the slit . a remotely - controlled drive motor outside the dewar turns an internal flip - mirror between the slit - viewing and spectrographic positions in @xmath84 sec .",
    "the flip mirror is located between the doublet and singlet of the spectrograph camera .",
    "the slit viewing optical prescription is listed in table [ tbl - sv ] .",
    "since the slit viewing mode is not intended for photometric imaging , all lenses in the slit viewing train are from manufacturer s stock to reduce material costs .",
    "light reflected from the slit is collimated by a caf@xmath40 lens and passes through a lyot stop sized to the pupil diameter of 5.1 mm .",
    "the collimated beam is then steered by two gold - coated fold mirrors to the spectrograph camera assembly .",
    "the beam also passes through a @xmath3 filter mounted between the fold mirrors ( tilted @xmath85 away from the spectrograph elements to reduce light contamination ) .",
    "the slit viewing filter can be changed by opening the dewar .",
    "lastly the beam is refocused onto the detector by the combined action of a caf@xmath40 lens and the final infrasil lens of the spectrograph camera ( figure [ opticalpath ] ) .",
    "the gold - coated flip mirror steers the light from the caf@xmath40 lens towards the final infrasil lens and detector .",
    "the plate scale of the slit viewer is @xmath86 , corresponding to an @xmath87 beam .",
    "this plate scale was chosen to give a fov ( @xmath16 ) large enough to aid the identification of targets in confused fields ( figure [ fpaimages ] ) .",
    "the slit - viewer design gives 65% encircled energy diameters of @xmath88 pixels on axis and @xmath89 pixels at the edge of the fov .",
    "light leakage from the slit viewing train when in spectroscopy mode is minimal because the flip mirror mechanism blocks the slit viewing beam just past the second slit viewing lens with a shaped baffle plate when not in use ( figure [ benchschematic ] ) .",
    "we gave extra care to minimize this source of stray light in such close proximity to the detector .",
    "autocad version 14.0 and mechanical desktop 2.0 ( autodesk , san rafael , ca ) were used for the mechanical design .",
    "the optics were designed assuming all elements inside the dewar are at 77k . since the optical mounts are machined at room temperature , distances between elements required by the optical prescription are adjusted for the linear expansion of materials ( table [ tbl - cle ] ) prior to the mechanical design and fabrication .",
    "thus upon cooling the elements are correctly positioned .",
    "all optical mounts were fabricated from the aluminum alloy 6061-t6 , the same material used for the off - axis paraboloid and grating substrate .",
    "the mounts are attached to a ` t ' cross - section aluminum ` optical bench ' extending from the dewar s cold plate .",
    "the use of only one material for all mounts reduced coefficient of thermal expansion ( cte ) effects and eased the difficulty of achieving good optical alignment at 77k .",
    "the aluminum optical bench , off - axis paraboloid , and grating substrate were thermally cycled between room temperature and 77k multiple times prior to final finishing to stabilize them .",
    "the prism is constrained through a system of six aluminum pads that form a semi - kinematic mount ( figure [ prismcage ] ) .",
    "three spring plungers oppose the pads in three dimensions and each exerts @xmath90 lbs force to constrain the @xmath91 pound prism . between each pad and the prism material",
    "is an indium shim to prevent abrasion ( figure [ prismcage ] ) .    to accommodate differing thermal contractions all lenses",
    "are mounted in lens barrels with oversized inside diameters to prevent crushing .",
    "retaining rings compress spring wave washers against the outer annulus of lens faces to accommodate differences in axial contraction during cooldowns .",
    "the flip mirror is driven by an externally mounted 30 vdc motor .",
    "a shaft directly couples the external motor to the flip mirror through an o - ring rotary seal at the dewar wall .",
    "the o - ring seal and a flexible coupling inside the dewar make up for small positional and axial changes upon cooling the instrument .",
    "mirror position is controlled by a logic circuit involving a remotely operated toggle switch at the observer s station and limit switches engaged by the motor shaft outside of the dewar .",
    "placement of the limit switches outside the dewar allows adjustment of the mirror - throw while the instrument is cold .",
    "the double - shielded dewar uses only @xmath78 liter of @xmath17 per night of observing .",
    "all appropriate surfaces are painted black for stray light reduction . after using one primer coat of the two - part 9924 wash primer , black polyurethane aeroglaze z-306 paint ( lord corporation , erie , pa ) mixed with carbon black powder",
    "was applied in two or more coatings to all exposed aluminum surfaces @xcite .",
    "the optical element mounts were designed to minimize stray light .",
    "lenses are mounted within cylindrical aluminum tubes , as mentioned above .",
    "particular attention was devoted to reducing stray light adjacent to the prism .",
    "since the reflective slit is close to the prism , both optical paths past the slit are well enclosed in tubes .",
    "the prism itself is enclosed in a mount that exposes only the entrance and exit faces to the optical beam .",
    "another critical area was that near the detector . to reduce stray light",
    "the final spectrograph camera and flip mirror assembly were placed within a rectangular enclosure that extends nearly to the cold plate to prevent the direct illumination of the detector by stray light from the shield walls ( figure [ benchpix ] ) .",
    "all transmissive elements in the spectrograph train were ar coated .",
    "alignment of the optical trains was completed in two parts - internal element alignment and alignment with the telescope secondary .",
    "first , alignment within the instrument was conducted in the lab with a hene laser . as discussed above , because all element mounts were made from aluminum , the relative alignment of the optical elements was preserved upon cooling from room temperature to 77k .",
    "a telescope simulator was used to re - image a neon illuminated point source onto the slit plane to check focus .",
    "the slit - viewing collimating lens and spectrograph f / conversion lens positions were adjusted to make the slit - viewer field and the spectrum confocal with the slit .",
    "second , the independent optical paths of the spectrograph and slit viewer were co - aligned with the telescope secondary through an iterative process . using a gimbaled sighting scope mounted on the telescope at the same position as cormass normally mounts ,",
    "the scope was centered on the center of the secondary .",
    "the scope ( with its directional alignment preserved ) was transferred to a cassegrain - mounting - plate - simulator in the lab and sighted onto a paper disk the diameter of the secondary and mounted at the distance of the secondary .",
    "cormass was then mounted onto the simulator and a neon lamp was used to trace the _ _ f/__cone of both optical paths at the distance of a paper disk .",
    "initially , the spectrograph _ _",
    "f/__cone was found to be aligned within @xmath92 of the secondary ( centers within 1 inch at the slit - secondary distance of 135 inches ) , but the slit viewing _ _",
    "f/__cone was found to be displaced 4 inches .",
    "the slit viewing train elements were re - aligned and a subsequent test showed the alignment to have improved to within @xmath92 .",
    "peak - up of both trains relative to the secondary can be fine - tuned by adjusting the position of 4 mounting blocks that attach the instrument to the cassegrain mounting plate .",
    "a set of mce-3 electronics from infrared laboratories provides clocking and readout of the nicmos3 array .",
    "four 16-bit analog - to - digital converters sample the output of each of the four nicmos3 quadrants with a pixel dwell time of 3 @xmath93 .",

    "the shading correction discussed above is not applied to science object images because the subtraction of adjacent nodded images removes the effect to a comparable noise level as the quadratic fit method .",
    "the apall task is then used for spectral extraction .",
    "wavelength calibration is accomplished by using line identifications from spectral observations of planetary nebulae , e.g. ngc 7027 and ngc 6210 .",
    "a third - order polynomial is fit to the identified lines to derive a dispersion solution across the orders .",
    "the fit residual rms is @xmath126 pixel ( @xmath127 ) across the wavelength coverage .",
    "the use of oh airglow lines was rejected because at the resolution of cormass ( @xmath0 ) , many airglow lines are blended together , especially in the h - band , making line identifications problematic .",
    "telluric absorption effects are removed by dividing by the reduced spectrum of a standard observed at similar airmass and hand corrected for stellar h paschen and brackett recombination lines as required .",
    "the ratio is then multiplied by a black - body with a temperature equal to the effective temperature of the stellar type of the calibrator observed @xcite .",
    "lastly , all observations for each order are weighted by the spectra mean and combined with the scombine task using a trimmed average .",
    "orders are stitched together with scombine after hand deletion of noisy data at the ends of the orders .",
    "a spectrum of the infrared bright planetary nebula ngc 7027 is shown in figure [ ngc7027 ]",
    ". the plentiful emission lines of planetary nebulae , primarily h and he lines , are used for wavelength calibration .",
    "cormass wavelength coverage and efficiency are well suited for the study of numerous types of objects including quasars , novae , and emission line objects .",
    "spectra of the low - mass objects vb 10 ( m 8v ) , 2massw j1507476 - 162738 ( l 5v , hereafter 2m1507 ) , and the t - dwarf 2massi j0559191 - 140448 ( hereafter 2m0559 ) are presented in figure [ sequence ] .",

    "cormass spectroscopically confirmed the classification of 2m0559 ( @xmath128 ) during the instrument s second run @xcite .",
    "2m0559 is 0.4 mag brighter than gl 229b and more than 1 mag brighter than the other field t - dwarfs discovered to date .",
    "this object s brightness will aid broad wavelength and high resolution study of its spectral class .",
    "while no methane combination and overtone absorption features at 1.6 and @xmath25 ( the features that define the t - dwarf class ) are evident in 2m1507 , weak fundamental methane absorption has been discovered at @xmath129 in 2m1507 and in an l 7.5 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the transition from co to @xmath8 as the primary carbon - bearing molecule as effective temperatures decrease commences as early as l 5v .",
    "this paper described the newly built and commissioned nir low - resolution ( @xmath0 ) prism cross - dispersed spectrograph cormass in operation on the palomar 60-inch telescope .",
    "this instrument was designed primarily for the identification of late - m and l - dwarf spectral features .",
    "cormass spectra of low - mass objects from the l , m , and t - dwarf classes , as well as the planetary nebula ngc 7027 , were presented .",
    "instrument characteristics include : + 1 . low - cost compact design . + 2 .",
