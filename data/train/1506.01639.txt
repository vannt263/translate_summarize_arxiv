    "the famous talk in which feynman proposed the idea of quantum computers was entitled `` simulating physics with computers ''  @xcite . in it",
    "he takes the point of view that to simulate physics on a computer , space and time should be discretized , and the dynamics should be local and causal ; he comments that a natural architecture would be a cellular automaton .",
    "since his goal is to simulate quantum physics , this would have to be a _",
    "quantum _ cellular automaton ( qca ) .",
    "we may think of this as a discrete quantum field theory , discrete in space and time , but also with only a finite dimensional hilbert space associated with each spacetime lattice site .",
    "such a system should be able to simulate , for example , scattering of particles in @xmath1 quantum field theory , as has recently been shown to be possible with a quantum gate array architecture  @xcite .",
    "the investigation of qca dates back to early papers of grossing and zeilinger  @xcite , of meyer  @xcite , and of durr and santha  @xcite , some of which focused on the technically easier case of periodic boundary conditions .",
    "one of the main difficulties has always been to construct explicit models in which the conditions of translation invariance , unitarity , locality and causality are simultaneously satisfied .",
    "the easiest way forward has been to reinterpret translation invariance in order to allow quantum lattice gas automata ( qlga ) models .",
    "we may note that studying ( classical ) lattice gas automata as a representative class within ( classical ) cellular automata ( ca ) has precedent in the works of toffoli  @xcite and hnon  @xcite .    the more recent work , within the last decade , of schumacher and werner  @xcite , arrighi , _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and of shakeel and love  @xcite has developed frameworks within which more general models satisfying the requisite conditions can be constructed .",
    "schumacher and werner  @xcite , and gross , _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , have developed an axiomatic definition of qca based on the _ desiderata _ of unitarity , locality and causality , as well as of translation invariance ( spatial homogeneity )  @xcite . in this formalism , the qca dynamics are described on a _ quasi - local _ algebra , by which they mean an increasing chain of finitely many tensor products of finite dimensional @xmath2-algebras .",
    "the qca evolution is in the heisenberg picture , and given by an automorphism of quasi - local algebra by _ local rules _",
    "@xcite . within this setup ,",
    "an _ index theory _ for a classification of one - dimensional qca was developed in  @xcite . a parallel definition of one - dimensional qca by arrighi , _ et al . _",
    "@xcite is given in the schrdinger picture , i.e. , one in which a qca is defined on a hilbert space and evolves unitarily . in this case the hilbert space has as its basis _ finite but unbounded configurations _ ( finitely many active cells in a quiescent background ) , and the qca state in it evolves by a unitary , casual and translation - invariant _ global evolution _ operator .",
    "shakeel and love  @xcite , working in the latter formalism and building on it , found conditions that determine when a multi - dimensional qca is a qlga .",
    "they investigated qlga because they are simple models for qca and have obvious physical interpretations  @xcite .",
    "their characterization uses a different set of algebraic substructures than the ones used in the index theory in  @xcite , and is motivated by the goal of classification of multi - dimensional qca explicitly by the form of the global evolution .",
    "they provide examples of qca that are not qlga , even in @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "these examples , however , do not propagate information , which leaves open the question of the existence of qca in the schrdinger picture model which have no particle interpretation , but which nevertheless propagate information .",
    "analogously , the @xmath1 quantum field theory simulation result  @xcite leaves open the question of how efficient a simulation is possible in regimes or for initial conditions not interpretable as scattering particles .",
    "our goal here is to show by a simple @xmath3-dimensional construction in the schrdinger picture that there are discrete quantum field theories ( qca ) that propagate information , yet without particle interpretation ( i.e. , not qlga ) at the time scale where the qca dynamics are homogeneous . in the heisenberg picture ,",
    "such examples are contained in the clifford qca presented in the work of schlingemann , _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "ours is another step in the direction of classifying qca by the dynamical processes at play in the transfer of information among cells .",
    "this is a program akin to that which has been carried out for reversible classical ca by kari  @xcite , toffoli  @xcite , and toffoli and margolus  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . section  [ section : prelim ] recalls the definition of qca and qlga , and the condition that determines when a qca is a qlga .",
    "section  [ sec : catqlga ] begins with the example that constitutes the main part of this paper : a one - dimensional qca that can not be described as a qlga , although it is built by concatenating two qlga .",
    "analysis of this example leads us to a conjecture generalizing this method of constructing qca to arbitrary lattice dimensions , cell hilbert spaces and neighborhoods .",
    "useful as this technique is , there are qca that are not obtainable in this manner , as the last proposition of the section shows .",
    "section  [ sec : conc ] is the conclusion with a summary of the results and a discussion of the wider context in which our work stands .",
    "we consider the qca model as formulated in  @xcite . in general , the lattice of cells is @xmath4 . for the reader who is not specifically interested in the technical details encountered in defining hilbert spaces and operators over infinite lattices",
    ", the lattice of cells can be taken as finite .",
    "this does not affect any of the interesting aspects of the example qca we discuss . wherever needed , we provide equivalent ( and simpler ) definitions for finite lattices , after the definitions for the infinite lattice .",
    "a finite lattice is of the form @xmath5 for some finite positive integers @xmath6 , @xmath7 , with the ends wrapping cyclically , or in other words , it is a torus . unless we are exclusively considering the infinite lattice , in which case we will make that explicit , we denote a lattice by @xmath8",

    "this proposition is unproven for infinite length qca as defined in this paper in the schrdinger picture .",
    "in this paper , we constructed a qca , on a one - dimensional lattice , from a concatenation of two simple qlga such that the constructed qca is itself not a qlga .",
    "in other words this qca has no particle interpretation at the time scale at which the qca dynamics are homogeneous .",
    "the proof of its non - qlga behavior relies on application of the condition developed in  @xcite characterizing when a qca is a qlga . in the same paper",
    ", it was noted that the question of complete qca classification is still open .",
    "we hope this construction is a step in the process of answering that question .",
    "our analysis suggests the conjecture that a more general result is possible , in which arbitrary cell dimension , lattice dimension , and any neighborhood scheme ( except the trivial neighborhood ) can be used in constructing such qca from qlga . for finite length qca",
    ", we showed by citing the clifford qca in  @xcite , that not all qca can be expressed as concatenations of finitely many qlga . in the larger theme of quantum simulations , and in view of the important work of jordan , _ et al . _",
    "@xcite on simulation of @xmath1 quantum field theory , the question arises as to the efficiency with which a quantum simulation model might simulate physics without a particle description .",
