    "the relation between the quantum and classical dynamics of nonlinear systems includes a specific side in the correspondence between the dynamical properties of systems treated in the mixed and fully quantized descriptions .",
    "various aspects of the correspondences between classical nonlinear systems on the one side and their fully quantized counterparts on the other have been intensively investigated in the last decade ( see e.  g.  @xcite ) . in many systems relevant for molecular and condensed matter physics",
    "the direct quantization of the full system in one step is , however , not possible from a practical point of view . as a rule",
    "such systems divide naturally into interacting subsystems .",
    "then a stepwise quantization is applied resulting in a mixed description , in which one of the subsystems is treated in the quantum and the other in the classical context . furthermore in complex systems",
    "the mixed description is often necessary for understanding global dynamical properties , e.  g. the presence of bifurcations and separatrix structures dividing the solution manifold into characteristic parts , before for a selected energy region the full quantization can be performed .",
    "this stepwise quantization is the basic idea on which the born - oppenheimer approximation developed in the early days of quantum mechanics for the quantization of systems dividing into subsystems is based .",
    "as is well known this approximation can be complemented into a rigorous scheme , if the nonadiabatic couplings are included @xcite .",
    "these couplings can be the source of nonintegrability and chaos of systems treated in the mixed quantum - classical description @xcite .",
    "then the problem of the quantum - classical correspondences arises on the level of the relation between the dynamical properties of the mixed and fully quantized descriptions @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider this dynamic relation for the particular model of a quasiparticle moving between two sites and coupled to oscillators .",
    "this is an important model system with applications such as excitons moving in molecular aggregates and coupled to vibrations , see e.  g.   @xcite .",
    "it has also attracted widespread attention in the context of the spin - boson hamiltonian and its classical - quantum phase space behavior and correspondence ( see e. g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "hence it seems appropriate to use this system as a model to analyze the relation between the mixed and fully quantized descriptions .",
    "treating the oscillators in the classical or quantum contexts , whereas the quasiparticle moving between two sites is a quantum object from the beginning , one arrives at mixed and fully quantized levels of description .",
    "we have recently investigated the dynamical properties of this model in the mixed description by integrating the corresponding bloch - oscillator equations and demonstrated the presence of a phase space with an underlying separatrix structure for overcritical coupling and chaos developing from the region of the hyperbolic point at the center of this structure . for increasing total energy chaos spreads over the product phase space of the system constituted by the bloch sphere and oscillator plane , leaving only regular islands in the region of the antibonding states @xcite .",
    "here we consider the problem of the relation between the dynamics in the mixed and fully quantum levels of description of the coupled quasiparticle - oscillator motion . investigating this relation we focus on the adiabatic parameter range , where the closest correspondence between the classical and quantum aspects of the oscillator dynamics can be expected .",
    "although several aspects of the dynamics of the system have been considered @xcite , there exists no systematic investigation in the adiabatic parameter range .",
    "in particular , such an investigation requires the numerical determination of a large number of eigenstates for the fully quantized system .",
    "the stationary properties of these states were reported in @xcite . in this paper these states are used to compute the dynamics of the fully quantized system and to compare the quantum evolution with the dynamics of the mixed description where the oscillator is treated classically . performing this comparison we use both the fixed and adiabatic basis sets in the mixed description .",
    "the latter basis set is of particular importance to clarify the role of the nonadiabatic couplings in the formation of the dynamics .",
    "we demonstrate the effect of the separatrix structure of the mixed description in the oscillator wave packet propagation of the fully quantized version , of dynamical subsystem correlations deriving from the separatrix structure and how the chaotic phase space regions of the system in the mixed description show up in the nonstationary properties of the time dependent full quantum state vector .    in section [ model ] the model will be specified in detail .",
    "the mixed quantum - classical description is discussed in section [ mqcd ] including the derivation of the equations of motion , the fixed point structure and the dynamical properties of the system on this level of description . in section [ qevol ]",
    "the evolution of the fully quantized system is presented and compared to the dynamics in the mixed description .",
    "we consider a quasiparticle coupled to oscillator degrees of freedom .",
    "the quasiparticle is specified as a molecular exciton in a tight binding representation and can be substituted by any other quantum object moving between discrete sites and described by a tight binding hamiltonian of the same structure .",
    "the system has the hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the excitonic , vibronic and interaction parts , respectively .",
    "@xmath1 represents the quantum subsystem , which is taken in the site representation @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the quantum probability amplitude of the exciton to occupy the @xmath6-th molecule and @xmath7 the transfer matrix element . for the intramolecular vibrations coupling to the exciton we use the harmonic approximation in @xmath2 @xmath8 here @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the coordinate , the canonic conjugate momentum and frequency of the intramolecular vibration of the @xmath6-th molecule , respectively .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian @xmath3 represents the dependence of the exciton energy on the intramolecular configuration for which we use the first order expansion in @xmath9 @xmath12 where @xmath13 are the coupling constants .",
    "the interaction is restricted to a single oscillator at each molecule .",
    "the case of a symmetric two site system @xmath14 , e.  g.   an exciton in a molecular dimer constituted by two identical monomers , is considered in what follows . for this case",
    "we set @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "then by introducing for the vibronic subsystem the new coordinates and momenta @xmath20 and for the excitonic subsystem the bloch variables @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the density matrix of the excitonic subsystem @xmath23 the relevant part of ( [ htot])-([int ] ) connected with the exciton coupled to the @xmath24 vibration is obtained in the form @xmath25 the part corresponding to @xmath26 is not coupled to the exciton and omitted .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hsymx ] ) can be represented as an operator in the space of the two dimensional vectors @xmath27 constituted by the excitonic amplitudes @xmath5 by using the standard pauli spin matrices @xmath28 @xmath29 . passing in ( [ hsymx ] )",
    "to dimensionless variables by measuring @xmath30 in units of @xmath31 and replacing @xmath24 , @xmath32 by @xmath33 one finally obtains @xmath34 here @xmath35 represents the dimensionless excitonic - vibronic coupling and @xmath36 is the adiabatic parameter measuring the relative strength of quantum effects in both subsystems .",
    "we focus on the adiabatic case @xmath37 when the vibronic subsystem can be described in the classical approximation . to make contact with the dynamical features following from the adiabatic approximation we derive the basic equations in both the fixed and the adiabatic bases .",
    "in this case the basis states are given by the fixed molecule sites @xmath38 .",
    "representing the excitonic state by @xmath39 ) and using ( [ bl ] ) the quantum equations of motion for the excitonic subsystem describing the transfer dynamics between the two sites are obtained .",
    "the classical equations for the dynamics of the oscillator are found by passing to the expectation values of @xmath40 and @xmath41 and using ( [ hsym ] ) as a classical hamiltonian function from which the canonical equations are derived . in this way one",
    "obtains the coupled bloch - oscillator equations representing the dynamics of the system in the mixed description @xmath42 besides the energy @xmath43 there is a second integral of the motion restricting the flow associated with the quantum subsystem to the surface of the unit radius bloch sphere @xmath44 sometimes it is advantageous to make use of this conserved quantity in order to reduce the number of variables to four , e.  g.  when a formulation in canonically conjugate variables is desired also for the excitonic subsystem .",
    "one then introduces an angle @xmath45 by @xmath46 we shall replace the usual bloch variables by these coordinates where it is appropriate .      in this case one",
    "first solves the eigenvalue problem of the part of the hamiltonian ( [ hsym ] ) which contains excitonic operators @xmath47 where @xmath40 is considered as an adiabatic variable .",
    "the eigenvalues of ( [ adham ] ) are given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 the eigenvalues are part of the adiabatic potentials for the slow subsystem @xmath50 the two eigenstates @xmath51 of ( [ adham ] ) represented by the fixed basis are given by @xmath52 the state vector of the excitonic subsystem is expanded in the adiabatic basis @xmath53 and inserted into the time dependent schrdinger equation",
    ". for obtaining the complete evolution equations in the adiabatic basis one has to take into account the time derivative of the expansion coefficients @xmath54 as well as the nonadiabatic couplings due to the time dependence of the states @xmath55 .",
    "the neglect of these couplings would result in the adiabatic approximation .",

    "the adiabatic oscillators can be considered as one dimensional integrable subsystems corresponding to the hamiltonians @xmath63 where @xmath64 is given by ( [ adpot ] ) .",
