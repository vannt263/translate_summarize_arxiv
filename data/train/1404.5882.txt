    "because the time to drift ionization from tracks out of the tpc volume is 16 @xmath4 and the drift is in the vertical direction , particles traversing the center of the tpc many @xmath4 before [ after ] the event trigger will have shorter [ longer ] recorded times and therefore appear to be well below [ above ] the center of the tpc . events with an excess of tpc tracks appearing at the top or bottom of the tpc were rejected , and mc studies , where no incident beam pileup is simulated , indicate the rejection of these events to have a negligible bias .",
    "track selection in this analysis , applied after event selection , is designed to reject tracks that are poorly reconstructed or do not originate from the target .",
    "we require all reconstructed tracks to be above a `` goodness - of - fit '' ( gof ) parameter threshold , derived from the trajectory fit residuals .",

    "a measurement of @xmath68 and @xmath69 yields from 120 gev / c protons incident on a numi low - energy target has been performed across 124 and 119 bins of bins respectively using data collected in the mipp fixed - target experiment at fermilab .",
    "typical uncertainties on the measurements in each bin are a few percent .",
    "these data may be directly used to improve the calculation and the uncertainties on the calculation of the neutrino flux in the numi beam line .",
    "this work was supported by the us department of energy .",

    "<S> the fixed - target mipp experiment , fermilab e907 , was designed to measure the production of hadrons from the collisions of hadrons of momenta ranging from 5 to 120 gev / c on a variety of nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> these data will generally improve the simulation of particle detectors and predictions of particle beam fluxes at accelerators . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrometer momentum resolution is between 3 and 4% , and particle identification is performed for particles ranging between 0.3 and 80 gev / c using @xmath0 , time - of - flight and cherenkov radiation measurements . </S>",
    "<S> mipp collected @xmath1 events of 120 gev main injector protons striking a target used in the numi facility at fermilab . </S>",
    "<S> the data have been analyzed and we present here charged pion yields per proton - on - target determined in bins of longitudinal and transverse momentum between 0.5 and 80 gev / c , with combined statistical and systematic relative uncertainties between 5 and 10% . </S>"
