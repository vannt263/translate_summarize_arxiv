    "this corresponds to a superluminal situation . in fig.([fig4 ] ) the solid curve is for @xmath78 hz and the dashed curve is for @xmath79 hz . as the damped rate of the mirror decreases",

    "we have investigated the tunable group delay of optical pulse in a nanomechanical one - sided cavity system and also we have explored the effect of the pump field power on the group delay .",
    "as the strength of the pump power increases the group delay becomes negatively larger .",

    "moreover , the dependence of the phase of the transmitted probe pulse on the frequency has been computed . in the absence of the coupling field ,",
    "the group delay time is @xmath80sec .",
    "whereas the magnitude of the group delay is on the order of @xmath77 msec at a high pump power such as @xmath81w for the parameters chosen in ref.@xcite .",
    "one can interpret that eit reverses the behavior of the nanomechanical system .",
    "superluminal light can be observed experimentally in a one - sided cavity system by adjusting the pump power .",
    "our results may be used for measuring the fast light in a nanomechanical medium by comparing the group delay of the probe pulse with a reference pulse propagating in the absence of medium .",
