    "one of the fundamental problems in molecular simulations is how to sum efficiently the pairwise interaction potential @xmath3 that forms the basis for calculation of nonbonded interactions .",
    "if the potential satisfies @xmath4 for @xmath5 , then the sum is guaranteed to be absolutely convergent ; otherwise , it is at best conditionally convergent . even in cases",
    "where the sum is absolutely convergent , however , explicit calculation of all the pairwise interactions , an @xmath6 operation per time step , quickly becomes computationally unfeasible for molecular dynamics simulations . circumventing",
    "this difficulty usually involves one of two routes . in the first ,",
    "a cutoff @xmath7 is introduced , outside of which interactions are neglected explicitly during the simulation .",
    "long - range contributions to chemical potential , surface tension , and other thermodynamic properties are calculated by integrating from the cutoff radius @xmath7 to infinity , assuming the radial distribution function @xmath8 equal to unity .",
    "certain cases , however , require large cutoff radii , which leads to computational inefficiency because of the large number of pairs needed to calculate the total pairwise sum .",
    "an alternative method involves transformation of the pairwise interactions beyond some `` crossover '' distance ( which we designate as @xmath9 ) into a more readily - solved problem .",
    "although truncation of the pairwise potential is more computationally efficient , and has in fact been used in parametrization of the spc / e , @xcite tip3p,@xcite and tip4p@xcite models of water , excluding interactions from consideration in the simulation can introduce significant errors in the values of thermodynamic properties obtained from a simulation .",
    "in such cases one generally relies on ewald summations , a technique which replaces the long - range calculations by a sum of replicas of the central box .",
    "we consider the effects of including explicit summation of long - range dispersion forces .",
    "these long - range forces are normally neglected in one - phase systems , but become of importance in multiphase systems or when studying interface phenomena .    following earlier work by williams @xcite and perram and co - workers,@xcite karasawa and goddard used long - range summations of dispersion forces to derive thermodynamic properties of argon and of nacl crystals .",
