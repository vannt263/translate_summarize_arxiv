    "one of the major problems of quantum information is the evaluation of the capacity of quantum communication channels , i.e. , the evaluation of the amount of _ classical information _ which can be reliably transmitted by _",
    "quantum states_. this problem has been extensively studied along with the development of other aspects of quantum information science .",
    "early works in this direction were devoted , mainly , to memoryless channels for which consecutive signal transmissions through the channel are not correlated .",
    "the capacities of some of such channels were determined @xcite-@xcite and it was proven that in most cases their capacities are additive . for gaussian memoryless channels under gaussian inputs , the multiplicativity of output purities was proven in @xcite and the additivity of the energy - constrained capacity even in the presence of classical noise and thermal noise was proven in @xcite .    in the last few years , much attention was given to quantum channels with memory @xcite-@xcite with the hope to find a possibility to enhance the channel capacity by using entangled input states .",
    "this would be possible if the capacity of such channels is superadditive .",
    "for some of such channels , for example , for bosonic memory channels in the absence of input energy constraints , the additivity conjecture was proven leaving no hope to enhance channel capacity using entangled inputs @xcite . however , for several other examples of quantum channels , where memory is introduced by a correlated noise , it was shown that entangling two consecutive uses of the channel enhances the overall channel capacity .",
    "these examples include qubit pauli channels @xcite and bosonic continuous - variable gaussian channels @xcite-@xcite . for qubit channels",
    "it was shown that if the noise correlations are stronger than some critical value , maximally entangled input states enhance the channel capacity compared to product input states .",
    "for gaussian channels also , entangled states perform better than product states",
    ". however , for each value of the noise correlation parameter , there exists an optimal degree of entanglement ( and not maximal entanglement ) that maximizes the channel capacity .",
    "quantum channels with correlated noise in dimensions @xmath1 were not considered in the literature in this context yet ( see note added ) .",
    "they correspond to a kind of intermediate systems between the qubit and gaussian channels .",
    "therefore , we expect to find new features that this intermediate dimensionality can add to the known facts .",
    "we start with a short review of the results on the capacities of the pauli qubit channels with memory studied in papers @xcite .",
    "then , we propose a generalization of these channels to @xmath0 dimensions and present new results on their capacity .",
    "the action of a transmission channel on an initial state @xmath2 is given by a completely positive ( cp ) map @xmath3 @xmath4 the amount of classical information which can be reliably transmitted through a quantum channel is given by the holevo - schumacher - westmoreland bound @xcite as the maximum of mutual information @xmath5 taken over all possible ensembles @xmath6 of input states @xmath7 with _ a priori _ probabilities @xmath8 .",
    "the mutual information of an ensemble @xmath6 is defined as @xmath9\\ ] ] where @xmath10 $ ] is the von neumann entropy .",
    "if we find a state @xmath11 which minimizes the output entropy @xmath12 and replace the first term in ( [ i ] ) by the largest possible entropy given by the entropy of the maximally mixed state , we obtain the following bound @xmath13 where @xmath2 is a @xmath14 matrix .",
    "this bound ( [ bound ] ) is very useful for further evaluation because it was shown to become tight for two - qubit channels @xcite which are covariant under pauli rotations , @xmath15 , such that the following equality holds : @xmath16 the two - qubit channels represent two consecutive applications ( denoted by @xmath17 ) of a one - qubit channel .",
    "the proof of the above statement is simple .",
    "it is based on the fact that the pauli matrices form an irreducible representation of a heisenberg group .",
    "this implies that for any two - qubit state @xmath2 , an equal probability ensemble @xmath18 is maximally mixed .",
    "now , let @xmath11 be an input two - qubit state that minimizes the output entropy @xmath19 .",
    "then , the equal probability ensemble ( [ ens ] ) made from this @xmath11 has the following properties . on the one hand",
    ", it is maximally mixed and therefore , it maximizes the first term in ( [ i ] ) . on the other hand , due to the channel covariance ( [ cov ] ) ,",
    "the second term in ( [ i ] ) becomes equal to the entropy @xmath20 which is minimal by our choice of @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , the equal probability ensemble ( [ ens ] ) made from @xmath11 attains the bound ( [ bound ] ) .",
    "finally , in order to find @xmath21 for covariant two - qubit channels ( [ cov ] ) it is enough to find one of the _ optimal _ states @xmath11 and calculate the right hand side of the bound ( [ bound ] ) , which is tight in this case .",
    "we will present a @xmath0-dimensional version of these arguments in the next section .    in general ,",
    "being a cp map , any quantum channel can be represented by an operator - sum : @xmath22 when @xmath23 represents @xmath24 uses of the same quantum channel , the hilbert space of the initial states is a tensor product such that @xmath25 .",
    "the amount of information transmitted per use of the channel in the limit of infinitely many uses of the channel determines the channel capacity @xmath26    if consecutive uses of the channel are not correlated then the repeated uses ( @xmath24 times ) of this memoryless channel can be represented by a tensor product of the form @xmath27 however , in the presence of correlations between consecutive uses of the channel the representation given by eq .",
    "( [ product ] ) is not valid .",
    "as an example , for _ pauli _ channels , whose action is represented by pauli matrices , @xmath24 uses of the channel is in general given by @xmath28 where the probability distribution @xmath29 is normalized @xmath30 and its particular properties determine different kinds of @xmath24-qubit pauli channels .",
    "a pauli channel is memoryless and can be represented as in eq .",
    "( [ product ] ) when @xmath29 is factorized into probabilities which are independent for each use of the channel , @xmath31 however , if each use of the channel depends on the preceding one , such that @xmath29 is given by a product of conditional probabilities @xmath32 a memory effect is introduced .",
    "indeed , the correlations between the consecutive uses of the channel act as if the channel `` remembers '' the previous signal and acts on the next one using this `` knowledge '' . this type of channels is called a markov channel as the probability ( [ pn ] ) corresponds to a markov chain of order 2 .    in the two - qubit pauli channels considered in @xcite @xmath33 a memory effect",
    "is introduced by choosing probabilities @xmath34 which include a correlated noise represented by the term with a kronecker s delta : @xmath35 the memory parameter @xmath36 $ ] characterizes the correlation `` strength '' . indeed , for @xmath37 , the probabilities of two subsequent uses of the channel are independent , whereas for @xmath38 , the correlations are the strongest ones .",
    "these channels are not exactly markov for the following reason .",
    "let us send @xmath39 qubits through such channels one after another and consider @xmath24 consecutive pairs of these qubits .",
    "the actions of the channel on the qubits belonging to the same pair are correlated according to ( [ mtqc ] ) and ( [ p ] ) .",
    "however , the actions of the channel on the qubits from different pairs are uncorrelated so that @xmath40",
    ". therefore @xmath39 consecutive uses of the channel are factorized into pairs and can be represented by a product of two - qubit channels @xmath41 where @xmath17 is defined by ( [ mtqc ] )",

    "the results of the evaluation @xcite show that product states of the form @xmath48 maximize the mutual information of memoryless channels ( @xmath49 ) of both types , whereas maximally entangled states of the form @xmath50 maximise the mutual information for the strongest noise correlations ( @xmath38 ) .",

    "therefore , effectively there is no crossover as @xmath55 can not be larger than 1 . in this case for all @xmath55",
    "the maximally entangled input states do not provide higher values of the mutual information than the product states , which is not the case for _ even _ dimensions .    in order to see the effect of intermediate phase correlations ,",
    "we draw in fig . 4 ( b ) the abscissae @xmath51 of the crossover points , as a function of _ odd _",
    "@xmath0 for the qd channel at various values of the `` friendness '' parameter @xmath66 .",
    "the upper horizontal line @xmath150 corresponds to the `` entanglement - non - friendly '' version of the channel ( @xmath133 ) presented also in fig .",
    "5 . for the qcd _ odd_-dimensional channel",
    "the picture is similar however , the upper horizontal line @xmath150 is achieved even for a nonvanishing value of the `` friendness '' parameter , @xmath151 .",
    "we have considered two types of @xmath0-dimensional quantum channels with a memory effect modeled by a correlated noise .",
    "we have shown that for @xmath0-dimensional channels with correlated noise there exist crossover points separating the intervals of the memory parameter @xmath55 where ensembles of maximally entangled input states or product input states provide higher values of the mutual information .",
    "this result is the same as in the 2-dimensional case .",
    "however it always holds only for channels ( which we call `` entanglement - friendly '' channels ) with a particular kind of phase correlations , namely anticorrelations . for these channels the crossover point move , with increasing @xmath0 , towards lower values of the memory parameter thus widening the range of correlations where maximally entangled input states give better results . for usual phase correlations",
    "the situation is opposite , namely , for higher dimensions of the space the crossover point is shifted towards @xmath145 so that only for higher degrees of correlations maximally entangled input states have advantages .",
    "in addition , for these `` entanglement - non - friendly '' channels the crossover point completely disappears for higher dimensions so that product input states always provide higher values of the mutual information than maximally entangled input states .",
    "therefore we conclude that the type of phase correlations strongly affects this entanglement assisted enhancement of the channel capacity .     as function of the memory parameter @xmath55 for different dimensions @xmath152 for qd entanglement - non - friendly channel ( @xmath133 ) with @xmath134.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in addition",
    ", we have observed that the parity of the dimension of the space of initial states makes an important difference in the `` entanglement - non - friendly '' channels .",
    "not only the curves of the mutual information vs. the memory parameter for odd dimensions are shifted with respect to the curves for even dimensions , but also the channels become completely `` entanglement - non - friendly '' in all odd dimensions so that maximally entangled input states are always worse than product states .",
    "strikingly , the channels with anticorrelated noise do not feel the parity of the space at all .",
    "however , any non - vanishing degree of the `` entanglement - non - friendly '' correlations reveals the parity effect .",
    "we note that the anticorrelated phases remind the bosonic gaussian channels considered in @xcite where the @xmath44 quadratures are correlated while the @xmath45 quadratures are anticorrelated . however , the existence of the crossover point is a significant difference with the case of the gaussian channels for which each value of the noise correlation parameter determines an optimal degree of entanglement ( different from maximal entanglement ) maximising the mutual information .",
    "a challenging problem is to find a link between these results for @xmath0-dimensional channels and the results obtained in @xcite for gaussian channels with finite energy input signals .",
    "finally we have presented a parametrisation illustrating a `` monotonous '' deformation of the curves of mutual information vs. the memory parameter , from product states to maximally entangled states .",
    "the crossover points stay intact during these deformations which may lead to a threshold type transition maximising mutual information from product states to maximally entangled states in case no other states perform better than the maximally entangled ones .",
    "we have to make this stipulation here because a full proof of the optimality of maximally entangled input states is still missing . _ note added : _ recently , we became aware of the work by v.  karimipour and l. memarzadeh on channels with memory for @xmath153 @xcite .",
    "we acknowledge the support of the european union projects secocq , chic and qap .",

    "therefore , the product input states do not feel the difference between the two types of phase correlations in the channel .    for the maximally entangled initial state ( @xmath90 ) rearranging the @xmath102 matrix representing the output state given by eq .",
    "( [ eqcdc ] ) , we find the eigenvalues @xmath157 for @xmath56 , the dependence on @xmath66 disappears together with the difference between `` entanglement - friendly '' and `` non - friendly '' channels and we recover the eigenvalues obtained in @xcite .",

    "( [ qcdcev ] ) for even dimensions , which is absent in eq .",
