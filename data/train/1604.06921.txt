    "clusters of galaxies with total masses @xmath3 within virial radii @xmath4 mpc are known ( cavaliere , gursky & tucker 1971 , see also sarazin 1988 for a review of the discovery and of early work ) to contain large masses around @xmath5 of a thin , hot proton - electron medium with number densities @xmath6 @xmath7 and temperatures @xmath8 k , i.e , particle energies around @xmath9 kev and total thermal energy up to @xmath10 erg .    high @xmath11 and low @xmath12 concur to render such an intracluster medium ( icm ) an optimal plasma with extreme ratios @xmath13 of the average kinetic to the interaction energy , as well as a fluid in local thermal equilibrium with mean free paths @xmath14 and @xmath15 shorter than the local scales from cluster cores to outskirts . in such conditions thermal , optically thin bremsstrahlung emission produces the intense x rays in the kev spectral region by which the icm was originally discovered .",
    "meanwhile , the sz effect ( i.e. , the comptonization by the hot icm electrons of the cold cmb photons crossing the cluster ) provides a parallel observational messenger now coming of age ( see cavaliere & lapi 2013 , henceforth cl13 ) .    the same hot , thin conditions also set in the icm high values of the specific entropy ( actually , the adiabat , see bower 1997 ) @xmath16 this quantity not only records additions to , and radiative losses from the icm , but also is shown below to play a role in opposing gravity within a potential well ( cf .",
    "voit et al .",
    "2005 ; cl13 ) .",
    "its values are found to range within @xmath17 kev @xmath18 at the center of a cluster . but outwards of the central @xmath19 kpc , they increase following a radial run close to @xmath20 ( tozzi & norman 2001 , voit et al .",
    "2005 ) up to several @xmath21 kev @xmath18 at the boundary @xmath22 of rich clusters ( see sarazin 1988 ) .",
    "such values far exceed the level @xmath23 kev @xmath18 that prevails in the outer intergalactic medium ( igm ) with its density @xmath24 @xmath7 and temperature @xmath25 around @xmath26 k ( e.g. , branchini et al .",
    "2009 ) , and is conserved on large scales by the adiabatic cosmic expansion .    on the other hand , internal agns on account of energetics can materially raise @xmath27 only in cluster cores or in small groups ( see lapi et al .",
    "so the high internal values throughout the body of clusters and intermediate groups must relate to local gravity .",
    "we hold that the gravitational pull of matter already settled in these galaxy systems causes outer intergalactic gas @xmath28 mixed with outer dark matter ( dm ) in the cosmic proportion around @xmath29 ( see kravtsov & borgani 2012 ) @xmath28 to supersonically flow in across the boundary , shock in its vicinity and within @xmath30 thermalize a fair share of its kinetic energy . thereafter the icm is adiabatically compressed and stratified in the gravitational potential well into a radial run @xmath31 .",
    "the role played by the latter in the final hydrostatic equilibrium of the icm may be briefly referred to as a modulation of the effective gravitational force , and is detailed in appendix a ( see also cavaliere et al .",
    "2009 , hereafter clff09 ) .",
    "a first overall test of this view is provided by recalling that matter already settled in a cluster sets the virial velocity dispersion at @xmath32 km s@xmath33 @xmath34 ; this involves also the average proton - electron pairs in the icm and corresponds to average temperatures @xmath35 kevs as observed .",
    "this encourages us to flesh out the above view by appropriately scaling with mass from clusters to groups the conversion from gravitational to thermal energy . note that already in cavaliere et al .",
    "( 1971 ; see sarazin 1988 ) it was proposed that hot , thin conditions ought to hold also in smaller associations of galaxies ; x - ray emission from a number of groups was at last established beginning with kriss et al .",
    "( 1980 ) and schwartz at al .",
    "( 1980 ) .    here",
    "we take up this lead , and stress that inflows into all such galaxy systems began since the very formation of a protocluster or protogroup at redshifts @xmath36 ( see appendix a ) .",
    "such inflows went on across the once current boundary @xmath37 to accrue about @xmath38 of the present total mass @xmath39 ( see the simulations by wang et al .",
    "the process implies the present entropy run @xmath31 to provide a time - resolved view of both the _ growth _ of the dm binding mass and the heating _ history _ of the icm in clusters and groups .",
    "is such a rich view challenged or confirmed by extended and resolved x - ray observations now coming up for galaxy groups with masses @xmath39 around @xmath40",
    "? this will be the key question tackled in the next sections .",
    "these are organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we first recap the gravitational production of entropy in clusters and its resulting profile , and then discuss the variants we expect in groups . in ",
    "3 we analyze the actual conditions observed in groups on using detailed x - ray data from _ suzaku _ and _ chandra _ concerning two significant instances provided by rxj1159 + 5531 ( redshift @xmath2 = 0.081 ) and eso 3060170 ( @xmath2 = 0.0358 ) . in   4",
    "we discuss our results and draw our conclusions .    throughout the paper",
    "we adopt the standard , flat and accelerating cosmology with round parameters : @xmath41 km s@xmath33 mpc@xmath33 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 ( hinshaw et al . 2013 ; _ planck _ collaboration xiii 2015 ) .",
    "then 1 arcmin corresponds to @xmath44 kpc at the distance of rxj1159 + 5531 , and to @xmath45 kpc for eso 3060170 .",
    "we first recap the process of gravitational entropy production in the icm and the resulting entropy profile in rich clusters , to set the stage for dealing next with groups .      toward the cluster boundary at @xmath46 ,",
    "the entropy run takes off from the central value @xmath47 and rises after @xmath48 with slope given by @xmath49 as derived by clff09 from matching the gas and the dm inflows so as to retain the cosmic proportion inside .",
    "the actual value of @xmath50 is modulated by the parameter @xmath51 .",
    "this expresses the ratio at the icm boundary @xmath52 of the gravitational to the thermal energy ; here @xmath53 is the proton mass and @xmath54 is the mean molecular weight in the icm , while @xmath55 is the dm circular velocity that in the following will normalize the gravitational potential in the form @xmath56 .",
    "the inflow velocity into a cluster is given in the latter s reference frame by @xmath57 km / s in terms of the outer gravitational potential drop @xmath58 from the turnaround radius @xmath59 where the infall starts to the virial @xmath60 ( see appendix a ) .",
    "so the inflow is easily supersonic relative to the sound speed @xmath61 @xmath62 a few @xmath19 km / s in the igm ; correspondingly , the inflow mach number @xmath63 considerably exceeds @xmath64 , so that accretion shocks are set at the boundary .",
    "specifically , in a layer of thickness @xmath65 close to the current virial radius , _ strong _ shocks will linger with mach numbers @xmath66 , where most of the infall bulk kinetic is converted into random thermal energy ( see appendix b ) .",
    "this yields @xmath67 , in terms of the specific kinetic energy @xmath68 of the gas freely falling across the outer potential drop @xmath58 .",
    "thus we find that @xmath69 may be expressed in two equivalent forms @xmath70 the first exposes the effect of the inflow mach number in the regime of strong shocks ; it is obtained from using for @xmath71 the post - shock rankine - hugoniot jumps ( see appendix b ) that yield @xmath72 in the cluster reference frame .",
    "the second form exposes the dependence on the outer shape of the gravitational well .",
    "it shows that @xmath69 takes on values @xmath73 corresponding to the parameter @xmath74 governing the jeans equilibria of the dm , that imply @xmath75 ( lapi & cavaliere 2009 ; see also lokas & mamon 2001 ) .",
    "such conditions hold for rich clusters , and there eqs .  ( 3 ) and ( 2 ) yield the standard value @xmath76 also obtained by tozzi & norman ( 2001 ) from their model .    here",
    "we stress that such steep slopes @xmath77 apply only in conditions of very effective thermalization of supersonic infall and entropy production ; these occur in strong shocks hovering at the current virial boundary , that allow only small residual bulk kinetic energy to seep through the shock .",
    "such conditions apply to rich clusters located in a dense environment that steadily feeds a smooth inflow , at least in sectors facing dense filaments of the large scale cosmic network .    on the other hand",
    ", all the above conditions may weaken or fail especially in evolved clusters at low @xmath2 in the accelerating universe ; they particularly do in cluster sectors facing a gas - poor region where the inflow has been recently starved .",
    "if so , _ outer _",
    "slope flattening will arise for @xmath78 ( see appendix a ) ; there @xmath79 is prone to taper off or even bend down , as indeed is observed in several instances ( e.g. , kawaharada et al . 2010 ; bonamente et al . 2012 ;",
    "walker et al .",
    "2012 ; ichikawa et al .",
    "2013 ) .      here",
    "we focus on a different issue , i.e. , why in galaxy groups flat slopes @xmath80 are to be expected for the entropy run _ throughout _ the intragroup medium .",
    "in fact , such values @xmath80 in the body of groups had been hinted at by clff09 and cl13 , on the basis of parameter values in eq .",
    "( 2 ) appropriate to groups . in detail",
    ", these authors expected @xmath81 0.6 - 0.8 to hold throughout the body of groups with @xmath82 .",
    "next we discuss why such values are to prevail and how they are understood .",
    "the key point is that groups feature generally shallower gravitational potential wells scaled to central depths @xmath83 , and _ flatter _ runs of the outer potential and of the dm density distributions .",
    "correspondingly , the parameter governing the jeans equilibrium ( see appendix a ) of the dm takes on values @xmath84 rather than @xmath85 appropriate for rich clusters ; the resulting profiles @xmath86 are illustrated in fig .  2 of cavaliere & lapi ( 2009 ) .",
    "here we stress that such conditions also imply a decrease of the active potential drop @xmath58 over the range @xmath87 to @xmath52 , so as to drive _ lower _ mach number inflows into groups relative to clusters .",
    "not only this feature is relevant by itself , but also it leads to a marked shock outgrowth .",
    "this is because weaker inflows reduce the dynamical stresses onto the shock surface , so that the latter outgrows the virial boundary ( see voit et al .",
    "2005 ) and reduces still more the relevant drop from the turnaround to the shock , to read @xmath88 ( clff09 ) .",
    "after eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 2 ) such values imply @xmath89 .    we emphasize that in groups these conditions and the corresponding _ low _ values of @xmath80 held all the way through their formation process , and so left their imprint at all points _ throughout _ the present structure . in sum , in a group the thermalization efficiency and the related entropy production",
    "have always been well below the values appropriate for rich clusters ( see fig .",
    "8 of cavaliere , lapi & fusco - femiano 2011 ) , and the correspondingly slopes @xmath80 remained frozen _",
    "everywhere_.    in addition , also a group may inhabit a thin or poor environment due to a very low value of @xmath2 locating it in the strongly accelerating region of the universe , or due to lack of surrounding large scale filaments . both conditions concur to cause _ additional _ flattening out or even bending down of the outer entropy run .    in sum , toward the outer regions of the groups we expect the entropy content to be considerably lower than in clusters .",
    "remarkably , the rich data set collected by sun et al . ( 2009 ) yielded an average value @xmath90 0.7 beyond 0.15 @xmath91 , even though with a wide dispersion ( see also bharadwaj et al . 2016 , their fig .",
    "even more remarkably , recent detailed observations concerning eso 3060170 with @xmath92 have yielded @xmath93 ( su et al .",
    "2013 ) , while from those concerning rxj1159 + 5531 with its mass @xmath94 ( see table 1 ) we derive @xmath95 as we shall see below .",
    "in fact , a flat slope @xmath80 results from our analysis of the x - ray data concerning @xmath96 and @xmath97 using our detailed supermodel ( sm ) .",
    "this advanced , entropy - based hydrostatic model , published by clff09 , incorporates the physical and smooth entropy pattern @xmath98 anticipated in   2.1 , where @xmath47 and @xmath79 are treated as two parameters set from fitting the data .",
    "a third free parameter is the scale provided by the temperature @xmath99 or the density @xmath100 at the virial radius ( see table 1 ) .",
    "we use the virial radii given in the literature ( see table 1 ) ; as to the dm ` concentration ' parameter , we adopt the standard value for groups @xmath101 10 ( see cl13 ) .",
    "reasonable variations ( @xmath102 ) of these two fixed parameters have negligible effects on our results .",
    "our model provides the profiles of @xmath96 and @xmath97 as detailed in appendix a. the same hydrostatic model has been used by su et al .",
    "( 2015 ) with many more free parameters in the entropy pattern , and is discussed in   4 .",
    "1 presents our fits to the temperature and density data obtained by su et al .",
    "( 2015 ) from _ chandra _ and _ suzaku _ x - ray observations of the group rxj1159 + 5531 in the north direction .",
    "our entropy profile derived from @xmath103 and shown in fig .",
    "2 ( red line ) closely agrees with the entropy data points independently obtained by the above authors from their observations of @xmath12 and @xmath11 in this group .",
    "we obtain @xmath104 , well below the value @xmath105 expected for rich clusters , but in line with our group evolution ( see   2.2 ) .",
    "note that a shallow slope @xmath106 is apparent at an inspection of fig .  2 , and that even shallower slopes are present in other directions as shown by the above authors .    by a similar analysis for eso 3060170",
    "we obtain @xmath107 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , having tested two different entropy patterns outside the core to describe the x - ray data obtained by the above authors .",
    "the first pattern rises in the form of a constant plus a simple power law as described by eq .",
    "( 4 ) ; the second ( detailed in appendix c ) starts up with an initial slope @xmath79 as above , and then flattens out for @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is a fitted parameter .",
    "the latter pattern closely follows all the entropy points independently obtained by su et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , and our value for @xmath79 is consistent with their @xmath110 . for rxj1159",
    "+ 5531 , on the other hand , out to the outer boundary we found no need or evidence of entropy bending ( see blue line of fig .  2 ) .",
    "we have extended downward to groups with @xmath0 our view and our evaluations concerning the thermal state of the icm in rich galaxy clusters with masses @xmath111 .",
    "such groups were expected ( see clff09 , cl13 ) to show considerably _ lower _ entropy levels throughout , with a run rising across the group body toward the virial boundary at definitely _ flatter _ slopes than @xmath105 .",
    "consistent data have been produced by sun et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "we understand this feature as a sheer effect of the low mass common to all these systems . in clusters the entropy production scales as @xmath112 ( see appendix a ) and converges to self - similar conditions , including the entropy slope @xmath113 . in the group regime",
    "the production has to compete with the advected entropy so as to break the self - similar behavior for the total entropy ( see appendix b ) .",
    "around @xmath0 we expect an even flatter radial run ; this is just what has been recently observed on comparing the two groups : eso 3060170 with @xmath114 and rxj1159 + 5531 with @xmath94 , see table 1 .",
    "note that for rxj1159 + 5531 our analysis is consistent with su et al .",
    "( 2015 ) for @xmath115 20 kpc ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , i.e. , over most of the group . the discrepancy for @xmath116 20 kpc is mainly due to the different density profiles @xmath96 entering the entropy ; it goes back to our fitting their de - projected density data , that yields lower values in the central bins .",
    "in fact , the observations of sun et al .",
    "( 2009 ) imply at @xmath117 6 kpc an entropy value larger than 15 kev @xmath18 , consistent with our profile .    from fig .  2",
    "it is easily perceived that the discontinuities in the entropy run as postulated by su et al .",
    "( 2015 ) in the form of a doubly broken power - law implying a total of eleven free parameters are neither really required by the data nor physically expected , as the authors themselves remark in their   6.2 .",
    "they conclude that the outer entropy is consistent with the gravitational value @xmath79 = 1.1 just as it holds for massive galaxy clusters , based on the intersection at the single point @xmath118 of their entropy profile with the straight line @xmath119 normalized after voit et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .    out of context",
    ", they feel that the properties of the intragroup medium in this fossil group , much less massive and more evolved than any rich cluster , would disfavor the interpretation in terms of recently _ starved _ accretion shocks proposed by cavaliere et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and reiterated by fusco - femiano & lapi ( 2014 ) in the different context of entropy flattening observed in the outskirts of several massive clusters . at variance with such a claim , in the present context",
    "we have shown in ",
    "2.2 that a flatter slope is to be expected throughout the body of groups as a consequence of weaker inflows always driven by reduced gravity related to their _ smaller _ masses .    in closer detail",
    ", we understand also some outer flattening out of the entropy profile in eso 3060170 , in terms of a recently _ starved _ inflow to be expected on considering its particularly low @xmath2 and poor environment noted by su et al .",
    "neither circumstance applies to rxj1159 + 5531 , which in fact shows no evidence of bending down or flattening out . finally , we understand on the basis of eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 2 ) why the slopes in groups generally show a _ wider _ intrinsic dispersion ( sun et al . 2009 ) ; this is because the values of @xmath69 , and even more those of @xmath79 ( given by eq .  2 as a difference between close terms )",
    "are particularly sensitive to relative variations of @xmath120 , the smaller potential drops that apply to groups .",
    "conversely , the apparent ` universality ' of @xmath105 in clusters goes back to the limited variance of @xmath69 related to lower relative variance of the larger values @xmath121 ( see   2 ) ; this yields a larger and more stable difference between the two terms of eq .",
    "( 2 ) providing the value @xmath122 .",
    "the gravitational origin of shallower entropy slopes within groups is nailed down on comparing the observations of rxj1159 + 5531 with those of eso 3060170 , these being the only two fossil groups observed to now with _",
    "suzaku _ out to their virial radii . in the latter and more massive group",
    "the entropy profile rises in the body with a shallow slope @xmath123 , but bends down sharply in the vicinity of its virial radius .",
    "we stress that such a behavior is just what we _ expect _ in a system that is twice as massive as rxj1159 + 5531 , but lies at a lower @xmath2 and is isolated in a poor environment ( see su et al .",
    "2013 ) . as such",
    ", it shares outer conditions with the cc clusters that provide evidence of real outer entropy flattening ( see lapi et al . 2010 ; walker et al .",
    "2012 ; fusco - femiano & lapi 2014 ) .",
    "if prodded on the specific ground of clusters , we would add that our interpretation of outer flattening of steep slopes in terms of recently _ starved _ inflow is born out by the azimuthal variations in entropy observed in a number of relaxed clusters ( see ichikawa et al .",
    "alternative explanations in terms of a clumpy icm would require quite high values of the clumpiness parameter @xmath124 7 ( see simionescu et al .",
    "2011 ; walker et al . 2013 ; fusco - femiano & lapi 2013 ) .",
    "these are at odds with many updated numerical simulations ( e.g. , vazza et al .",
    "2013 ; zhuravleva et al . 2013 ; roncarelli et al .",
    "2013 ) , and do not show up in probing the conducive outskirts of typical merging clusters like abell 1750 ( bulbul et al .",
    "2015 ) . on the other hand , the values @xmath125 at @xmath118 as used by eckert et al .",
    "( 2015 ) are far insufficient to explain the entropy bending observed in many clusters since the clumpiness contribution to @xmath126 is just a factor @xmath127 .",
    "we conclude that on comparing the two groups discussed above , the observed entropy profiles both in the body and at the boundary turn out to behave in detail just as we expect on account of their mass ratio and of their specific redshift / environment differences ( see table 1 ) . in a nutshell",
    ", a flat internal slope relates to low @xmath39 , while an outer bending relates to a poor environment .    on the strength of the above multiple evidence",
    ", we claim our articulated view concerning the thermal state of the medium filling groups vs. clusters to have been fully confirmed .",
    "we acknowledge useful discussions with f. gastaldello .",
    "we thank our referee for constructive comments that were helpful to sharpen our aim .",
    "for the reader s convenience , here we first recall the standard scenario for the formation of clusters and groups ( reviewed in detail by kravtsov & borgani 2012 , and used in   1 ) .",
    "this envisages dm overdensities initially following the hubble expansion , then turning around when their size approaches to @xmath128 , to collapse and virialize at redshifts @xmath129 or to @xmath130 for masses in the cluster or in the group range , respectively .",
    "we add , following lapi & cavaliere ( 2009 ) and wang et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , that mass inflow continues on and goes mainly into extending the outer halo .",
    "the result ( used in   2 and 3 ) is a mass density radial profile with a sersic - einasto shape .",
    "this provides a good analytic approximation to our results for the simplest jeans equilibria of the dm ( @xmath131 - models , with @xmath132 for clusters and @xmath84 for groups , see lapi & cavaliere 2009 ) , as well as to the outcome of updated numerical simulations ( e.g. , wang et al .",
    "these models provide the values of @xmath133 used in   2 .    within such mass distributions ,",
    "frequently used ( as we do in   2 and 4 ) reference sizes comprise an average overdensity @xmath134 or @xmath135 higher than the critical density , and read @xmath136 or @xmath137 , respectively .",
    "the hydrostatic equilibrium of the icm in the gravitational potential well corresponding to the mass cumulative distribution @xmath138 of a cluster or group is expressed by clff09 and cl13 in the entropy - based form @xmath139 where @xmath53 is the proton mass and @xmath140 the gravitational constant .",

    "in addition , the electron pressure may be directly obtained from the sz effect , see cl13 and references therein .",
    "such a non linear rise yields the threshold @xmath144 stated in   4 .",
    "next , to complement ",
    "2 we write the rankine - hugoniot jumps in the cluster / group reference frame for the post - shock relative to the pre - shock temperature and entropy .",
    "these are obtained from conservation of mass , momentum and energy across the shock surface at @xmath145 , in fact , over the thickness of an electron mean free path @xmath146 ( where @xmath147 , see zeldovich & raizer 1967 ) complete equilibrium is achieved .",
