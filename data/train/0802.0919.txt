    "our objects of study are flat surfaces and their affine automorphism groups .",

    "much of the interest in the subject was generated by veech s discovery @xcite of veech groups which are non - arithmetic lattices ( recall that @xmath11 is called a _ lattice _ if @xmath12 has finite area ) .",
    "many additional veech groups have been described , including infinitely generated ones @xcite , and there are many intriguing questions regarding groups which may arise as veech groups .",
    "see @xcite for a recent survey of the field , and @xcite for a problem list .",
    "a fundamental question in this regard is to understand the commensurability classes of fuchsian groups which contain veech groups ( recall that a _ fuchsian group _ is a discrete subgroup of @xmath9 and two of such groups are _ commensurable _ if their intersection is of finite index in both ) .",
    "we will describe some restrictions on groups commensurable to a veech group @xmath11 and on the geometry of the corresponding @xmath12 .",
    "the question of which groups within a given commensurability class actually arise as veech groups is also of considerable interest , see @xcite .",
    "it is clear that if @xmath11 is a lattice , there is an upper limit on the radius of a maximal embedded disk .",
    "we have the following converse , which provides a new characterization of lattice surfaces .",
    "[ cor : new ] if @xmath11 is commensurable to a veech group and is not a lattice then for every @xmath13 , @xmath12 contains an embedded disk of radius @xmath13 .",
    "we derive a purely group - theoretic property of veech groups :    [ cor : normalizer ] a non - elementary fuchsian group commensurable to a veech group is of finite index in its normalizer .",
    "these theorems follow from some finiteness results which involve an upper bound on either the covolume of a cusp for @xmath8 , or the eigenvalue of a hyperbolic element in @xmath8 . for a fuchsian group @xmath11 , to a cusp in @xmath12 one may associate the _ cusp area _  the hyperbolic area of a maximal continuous embedded family of parallel horocycles  and the number of cylinders in the corresponding decomposition of the surface .",
    "moreover these quantities are invariant under affine equivalence .",
    "equivalently , in group - theoretic terms , a cusp in @xmath12 is determined by the conjugacy class of a maximal parabolic subgroup @xmath14 .",

    "suppose @xmath8 contains a hyperbolic element @xmath36 .",
    "we denote the larger eigenvalue of @xmath36 by @xmath37 and call it the _ eigenvalue _ of @xmath38 . also , associated to @xmath36 are _ markov partitions _ of @xmath4 ( see  5 ) .",

    "we can assume the @xmath127 are rectangles with horizontal and vertical sides .",
    "the horizontal and vertical directions are contracted by either @xmath173 or @xmath395 , but these maps preserve the set of saddle connections , so there are no horizontal or vertical saddle connections on @xmath4 . in particular each edge of each @xmath127 can only contain one singularity , so that the total angle around singularities coming from each @xmath127 is at most @xmath422 .",
    "this implies that @xmath517 , proving the first assertion .    to prove the second assertion , by proposition [ prop : double cover ] it suffices to consider strata of translation surfaces .",
    "also , if we have a markov partition for @xmath518 , the common refinement of its images under @xmath519 , @xmath520 , provides a markov partition for @xmath173 .",
    "thus by passing to a suitable finite power of @xmath173 , which can be taken to depend only on @xmath10 , we can assume that @xmath173 fixes all the singularities and all the critical leaves issuing from singularities .",
    "assume without loss of generality that the contracting direction for @xmath173 ( resp .",
    "@xmath395 ) is vertical ( resp .",
    "horizontal ) .    since there are no horizontal or vertical saddle connections , the foliation in both the horizontal and vertical direction is minimal , so the leaves intersect any transverse segment .",
    "we will construct the edges of the partition in 3 steps .    1 .",
    "let @xmath225 be a short closed segment starting at a singularity and going along a horizontal leaf , say from left to right , and let @xmath187 be a union of closed segments starting at each singularity along the vertical leaves ( going both up and down ) until the first point of intersection with @xmath225 .",
    "denote the segments comprising @xmath187 by @xmath521 .",
    "the intersection @xmath522 is finite , so there is a _ terminal point _",
    "@xmath49 which is the right - most intersection point of @xmath523 .",
    "remove from @xmath225 the subsegment to the right of @xmath49 .",
    "we retain the name @xmath225 for the shorter segment .",
    "3 .   suppose @xmath524 ends at @xmath49 .",
    "continue it further until its next intersection with @xmath225 .",
    "we retain the names @xmath525 for this new collection .",
    "since @xmath4 has no vertical saddle connections , the new intersection point of @xmath524 with @xmath225 is not one of the previous ones , and no two of these new intersection points coincide .",
    "we first claim that each connected component of @xmath526 is a rectangle .",
    "take a segment @xmath527 which is bounded by either a singularity and the first point where a @xmath528 comes down to @xmath225 , or by two consecutive points at which @xmath528 s come down to @xmath225 .",
    "consider the union of vertical leaves which begin at points of @xmath529 and move upwards .",
    "these form a strip , which near @xmath225 is bounded on both sides by segments in @xmath187 . by choice of the @xmath524",
    "all these leaves all hit @xmath225 again ` at the same time ' , i.e. none of these leaves hit a singularity or a terminal point before returning to @xmath225 .",
    "the construction also ensures that the segments from @xmath187 on both sides of the strips also extend until the next intersection with @xmath225 .",
    "thus the strip is a rectangle bounded by @xmath530 .",
    "we now claim that this partition into rectangles has the markov property . since @xmath395 fixes each singularity and maps each critical leaf to itself , and since it contracts the horizontal direction , @xmath225 is mapped into itself .",
    "this implies that lower boundaries of rectangles map into lower boundaries under @xmath395 . for identical reasons",
    "each @xmath524 is mapped into itself by @xmath173 .",
    "now note that the endpoints of lower edges of rectangles on @xmath225 are the terminal point @xmath49 , the singularity , and one additional point for each downward pointing edge in @xmath187 . in total",
    "we have @xmath531 endpoints which gives @xmath532 rectangles .",
    "in particular the number of rectangles depends only on @xmath10 .",
