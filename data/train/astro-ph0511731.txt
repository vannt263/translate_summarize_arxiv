    "galaxies are resolved into individual  ii regions , enabling a direct measurement of the gas - phase abundance at discreet spatial positions . by comparison ,",
    "spectra of distant galaxies are a luminosity - weighted average of star - forming regions spanning a range of physical conditions , stars , and diffuse gas . in this paper",
    "we investigate whether spatially unresolved spectroscopy of spiral galaxies encompassing all , or a significant fraction of the light , reliably measures the gas - phase abundance as determined from spectroscopy of individual  ii regions .",
    "our analysis focuses on disk galaxies for two reasons . first , luminous star - forming disk galaxies at high redshift are more likely to be observed compared to low - luminosity dwarf galaxies .",
    "second , several physical properties of disk galaxies may systematically bias abundance measurements based on integrated spectroscopy . for example , whereas spiral galaxies exhibit radial abundance variations , to first order , dwarf galaxies are chemically homogenous ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we anticipate the largest discrepancy between integrated and spatially resolved abundances to arise in a sample of disk galaxies .    one of the most striking and characteristic properties of disk galaxies is the tendency for their centers to be more metal rich than their outskirts .",
    "although the exact physical processes that give rise to radial abundance gradients are still a matter of debate ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , it has been shown that the vast majority of nearby disk galaxies , if not all , possess radial gradients ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since distant galaxies may have steeper abundance gradients , indicative of their earlier evolutionary state ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is important to quantify how variations in the slope of the abundance gradient affects the abundances we infer from integrated spectroscopy .",
    "another common , if not ubiquitous physical property of spiral galaxies , including the milky way , is the diffuse , low surface - brightness phase of the interstellar medium called the diffuse - ionized gas ( dig ) , or the diffuse - ionized medium ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "of order @xmath8 of the integrated @xmath6 luminosity in spiral galaxies can be attributed to the dig , making it an energetically important component of the interstellar medium of disk galaxies ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . since",
    "low - ionization line - ratios such as [  ii]/@xmath6 and [  ii]/@xmath6 in the dig are enhanced relative to ratios involving high - excitation lines such as [  iii]/@xmath9 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we want to determine what effect , if any , the integrated dig emission of a disk galaxy has on the abundance we measure from its integrated spectrum .    finally , it is important to explore how variations in dust attenuation might bias integrated abundance measurements . since the @xmath6 line becomes inaccessible to ground - based optical spectroscopy above @xmath10 , it may not always be possible to correct the nebular lines for dust reddening ( e.g. , @xcite , but see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we compare the abundances derived from the observed line fluxes , the reddening - corrected fluxes , and the emission - line equivalent widths , which , to first order , are insensitive to the effects of dust @xcite . in the presence of all these systematic effects ,",
    "we want to determine whether we can measure the `` integrated '' gas - phase abundance of a disk galaxy , and , if so , how we can physically interpret that measurement .",
    "previous efforts investigating the integrated abundances of spiral galaxies found that integrated spectroscopy provides a fairly reliable measure of the gas - phase abundance @xcite .",
    "however , these studies synthesized integrated spectra by co - adding observations of individual  ii regions ; therefore , they could not investigate the systematic effects of dig emission and dust reddening .",
    "recently , we have obtained spatially unbiased ( integrated ) spectroscopy for several hundred nearby galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter mk06 ) . here",
    ", we combine these data with spectroscopy of individual  ii regions culled from the literature to investigate whether chemical analysis methods can be used to estimate the metallicities of spatially unresolved star - forming galaxies .",
    "investigating the integrated nebular abundances of disk galaxies quantitatively poses several observational challenges .",
    "first , because of practical considerations ,  ii - region abundance measurements are generally only available for nearby galaxies subtending relatively large ( @xmath11 ) angular diameters on the sky . at the same time , obtaining an integrated spectrum of an object that is larger than the typical length of a long - slit ( @xmath12 ) can be very difficult .",
    "nevertheless , our survey ( mk06 ) includes among the first integrated spectra of spiral galaxies with measurable radial abundance gradients .    as part of a larger effort to study extra - galactic star formation ,",
    "we have obtained integrated , optical ( @xmath13   ) spectrophotometry at @xmath14   fwhm resolution for a diverse sample of @xmath15 nearby ( @xmath16  mpc ) galaxies ( mk06 ) .",
    "our survey implements the @xcite long - slit drift - scanning technique to obtain integrated spectra of large galaxies at the spectral resolution afforded by a @xmath17 long - slit ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the size of each galaxy at the @xmath18  mag  arcsec@xmath19 isophote dictates the parameters of the drift - scan , and the width of the extraction aperture .",
    "the resulting spectra typically include @xmath20 of the optical light .",
    "these observations are ideally suited to our analysis because they are analogous to obtaining a normal ( spatially fixed ) optical spectrum of a distant galaxy , which subtends a corresponding smaller angular diameter on the sky .",
    "in mk06 we present the fluxes and equivalent widths ( ews ) of the strong nebular emission lines , including [  ii ]  @xmath21 , [  iii ]  @xmath22 , [  ii ]  @xmath23 , @xmath6 , and @xmath9 , for the complete sample of galaxies .",
    "hereafter , we assume that [  iii ]  @xmath24 is @xmath25 times the [  iii ]  @xmath22 intensity , as determined by atomic physics @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the temperature - sensitive [  iii ]  @xmath26 line is typically not detected in our spectra , which is not surprising given that this line becomes vanishingly weak in metal - rich galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; therefore , we must rely on so - called strong - line calibrations to estimate the oxygen abundance ( see  [ sec : intoh ] ) .",
    "the nebular line measurements presented in mk06 include a careful treatment of underlying stellar absorption , which is among the most important systematic effects to consider in any emission - line abundance analysis . in spectroscopic studies of individual  ii regions ,",
    "the balmer lines are typically corrected for a constant @xmath27   of stellar absorption , corresponding to the amount of absorption expected for a young ( @xmath28  myr ) stellar population ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , in general , the integrated , luminosity - weighted stellar population of a galaxy will differ considerably from that of a single star - forming region .",
    "in particular , the assumption of a constant amount of stellar absorption for @xmath6 and @xmath9 may break down , since different stellar populations will dominate the integrated light at red ( @xmath29   ) and blue ( @xmath30   ) wavelengths , according to the particular star - formation history of each galaxy . moreover , the exact correction depends on spectral resolution , since the nebular lines are typically narrower than the underlying absorption .    to address these issues , in mk06 we use population synthesis to model the integrated absorption - line spectrum of each galaxy in our sample .",
    "we fit a non - negative linear combination of seven instantaneous - burst @xcite population synthesis models , convolved to the instrumental resolution , with ages ranging from @xmath31  myr to @xmath32  gyr . including a simple treatment of dust reddening , this method results in precise subtraction of the stellar continuum underlying the nebular emission lines ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "for the subset of galaxies considered in this analysis ( see below ) , the @xmath9 absorption ranges from @xmath33 to @xmath34   , with a mean value of @xmath35   . the corresponding correction for @xmath6 is @xmath36   , with a mean of @xmath37   .",
    "we define our sample according to two selection criteria .",
    "first , we restrict the objects observed by mk06 to spiral galaxies with well - detected ( @xmath38 ) @xmath6 and @xmath9 emission lines .",
    "we also reject galaxies whose integrated emission - line spectrum is clearly dominated by an active nucleus ( e.g. , ngc  1068 ) .",
    "next , we conduct a search of the literature for spectroscopy of individual  ii regions in the remaining objects . , [  iii ] , and @xmath9 nebular lines , since these are the most likely lines to be measured in distant galaxies .",
    "this requirement eliminates the imaging spectrophotometric data of the galaxies in our sample presented by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , among others . ] our search results in data on @xmath39  ii regions in @xmath0 disk galaxies .",
    "the median number of  ii regions per galaxy is @xmath40 .",

    ": sample ] , the size of the sample is determined by simultaneously requiring integrated spectroscopy _ and _ spectroscopy for a sufficient number of individual  ii regions . in terms of @xmath42-band luminosity ,",
    "the sample is generally biased toward bright galaxies , since lower - luminosity galaxies tend not to exhibit abundance gradients .",
    "we note , however , that our sample spans more than an order - of - magnitude in @xmath42-band luminosity , from @xmath51 to @xmath52  mag . for comparison , the absolute @xmath42 magnitudes of the disk galaxies studied by @xcite , which is the most comprehensive compilation of galaxies with measured abundance gradients to date , range from @xmath53 to @xmath54  mag .",
    "the distribution of inclination angles in our sample is fairly broad , ranging from @xmath55 in ngc  3344 , to @xmath56 in ngc  3198 ; the mean inclination angle is @xmath57 . in  [ sec : results ] we test whether variations in inclination along the line - of - sight systematically biases the integrated abundances .",
    "the distribution of morphological types in our sample is weighted toward late - type galaxies : @xmath58 of the sample is type sbc or later , with only two early - type objects , ngc  3351 ( sb ) and ngc  4736 ( sab ) .",
    "this bias arises because of observational and physical selection effects which tend to prefer late - type galaxies .",
    "for example , the number of early - type galaxies with measured abundance gradients is relatively limited , because  ii regions in early - type galaxies are rarer and have lower luminosities and surface brightnesses than corresponding  ii regions in late - type galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we note , however , that our sample includes galaxies that are as luminous and metal - rich as other well - known early - type disk galaxies such as m  81 @xcite .",
    "a related selection effect is that in the integrated spectra of early - type galaxies the equivalent widths of the nebular lines , if present , tend to be significantly lower than the corresponding emission - line equivalent widths in late - type galaxies .",
    "this observation can be attributed to the lower star - formation rate per unit luminosity or mass in early - type galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "despite the relatively small number of early - type galaxies , we argue that our sample is still representative for the kind of analysis we are conducting , and that our conclusions are not strongly affected by this morphological bias . in particular , the objects most likely to be studied at high redshift should have higher gas resevoirs , high specific star - formation rates , and large emission - line equivalent widths .",
    "for example , in an analysis of @xmath59 star - forming galaxies at @xmath60 , @xcite found an average @xmath9 emission - line ew of @xmath61   , while @xcite measured @xmath9 ews in excess of @xmath62   in a sample of five lyman - break galaxies at @xmath63 .",
    "finally , since early - type galaxies tend to have shallow abundance gradients , small amounts of dust , and a weak or absent dig phase , we do not expect the integrated abundances of early - type galaxies to differ significantly from the abundances infered from spectroscopy of individual  ii regions .",
    "[ sec : analysis ]      we use the emission - line measurements from mk06 to compute the integrated oxygen abundances of the galaxies selected in  [ sec : sample ]",
    ". a principal assumption of this method is that the observed emission lines arise via photoionization from massive stars .",
    "consequently , it is important to assess any possible contamination from nuclear activity in our integrated emission - line spectra . @xcite",

    "none of the residual correlations using the pt05 calibration are significant , although the increased scatter in the pt05 abundances ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gradients ] , table  [ table : resid ] ) may be masking any underlying trends .    the positive correlation between the abundance residuals and inclination angle ,",
    "if it exists , is opposite of what we would have expected .",
    "the correlation indicates that the integrated abundance of an edge - on galaxy is _ higher _ than the corresponding metallicity of a less - inclined galaxy .",
    "given the existence of radial abundance gradients ( e.g. , fig .  [",
    "fig : gradients ] ) , we would have anticipated the integrated spectrum of an inclined galaxy to be weighted more toward the outer , metal - poor  ii regions .",
    "this exact trend is shown by ( * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite find that edge - on galaxies may appear , on average , @xmath47  dex ( @xmath108 ) more metal - rich than face - on galaxies .",
    "since this systematic difference is comparable to the amount of chemical enrichment between the present day and @xmath7 ( e.g. , j.  moustakas et  al .",

    "* ) , sample selection effects that may be biased with respect to inclination angle should be carefully considered in look - back studies of galactic chemical evolution ( e.g. , tully - fisher studies ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , indicating a prominent dig phase , the lack of a significant correlation between @xmath103 and the abundance residuals in figures  [ fig : ohresid_m91]_d _ and [ fig : ohresid_pt05]_d _ suggests that integrated abundance measurements are relatively unaffected by dig emission . to explore this result in more detail , in figure  [ fig : ratios ] we plot two emission - line diagnostic diagrams for our sample ( _ squares",

    "moreover , we observe that the integrated line - ratios preferentially lie at or above the upper envelope defined by the  ii regions ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the enhancement of low - ionization lines in the dig is generally attributed to a low ionization parameter ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , recent self - consistent theoretical models of aging star - forming regions reveal that old , low surface - brightness  ii regions exhibit higher [  ii]/@xmath6 and [  ii]/@xmath6 ratios relative to young , luminous  ii regions ( m.  dopita 2006 , private communication ) .",
    "regardless of its physical origin , our integrated spectra show a clear enhancement of low - ionization emission relative to  ii regions .",
    "one implication of this result is that [  ii]- or [  ii]-based strong - line abundance diagnostics applied to integrated spectra of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may be moderately biased toward higher metallicities .    in figure",

    "the emission - line sequences defined by galaxies ,  ii regions , and regions of dig generally overlap . unlike [  ii]/@xmath6 and [  ii]/@xmath6 , lines of constant ionization parameter run nearly parallel to the [  iii]/@xmath9 versus [  ii]/@xmath9 emission - line sequence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we conclude , therefore , that measurements based on the globally averaged @xmath5 parameter give abundances that are fairly representative of the gas - phase oxygen abundances of galaxies .",
    "we conclude this section by testing one of the principal assumptions of the preceding analysis .",
    "following @xcite , we have defined the characteristic abundance of a disk galaxy as the oxygen abundance at @xmath81 ( see also * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , given the form of the abundance gradient , we can _ derive _ the normalized galactocentric radius , @xmath109 , where the integrated abundance equals the gas - phase abundance , assuming that the reddening - corrected integrated abundance is a perfect measure of the gas - phase abundance .",
    "for this calculation we only consider the m91 abundance calibration , which produces smaller uncertainties in the gradient slopes ; we also exclude ngc  2541 , which exhibits an increasing abundance with radius ( although the slope is formally consistent with zero ) .",
    "we find that @xmath110 ranges from @xmath47 in ngc  2903 , to @xmath111 in ngc  3344 , with a mean value of @xmath112 .",
    "not surprisingly , @xmath110 correlates with the slope of the abundance gradient , in the sense that the integrated abundances of galaxies with steeper abundance gradients are systematically higher than the integrated abundances of galaxies with shallower gradients .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that the dominant source of scatter in the abundance residuals found in figures  [ fig : ohresid_m91][fig : ohresid_pt05 ] ( see also table  [ table : resid ] ) is due to assuming a fixed @xmath113 .",
    "our analysis shows that while this is a reasonable average assumption , the exact radius does vary from object - to - object in a way that depends mildly on the slope of the abundance gradient .",
    "in this paper we have investigated whether spatially unresolved ( integrated ) spectroscopy of a spiral galaxy can be used to infer its mean interstellar oxygen abundance , as measured from observations of individual  ii regions .",
    "our analysis makes use of a new integrated spectrophotometric survey of nearby star - forming galaxies presented by @xcite , and observations of more than @xmath1  ii regions culled from the literature .",
    "our final sample consists of @xmath0 , predominantly late - type spiral galaxies spanning a wide range of @xmath42-band luminosity , inclination angle , @xmath6 surface brightness , and dust content ( table  [ table : intoh ] ) . for the first time , these data allow us to investigate the systematic effects of diffuse - ionized gas emission , dust reddening , and the slope of the abundance gradient on the determination of integrated abundances .",
    "we derive integrated oxygen abundances using the emission - line measurements presented by @xcite , who carry out a careful treatment of underlying stellar absorption .",
    "we apply both a theoretical @xcite , and an empirical @xcite strong - line ( @xmath5 ) abundance calibration to the observed emission - line fluxes , the reddening - corrected fluxes , and the emission - line equivalent widths ( following * ? ? ?",
    "we analyze the  ii - region data compiled from the literature self - consistently ; in particular , we determine the  ii - region abundances using the same abundance calibration applied to the integrated emission lines , and we compute the de - projected galactocentric position of each object using robust inclination and position angles determined in the near - infrared . with these measurements ,",
    "we derive the form of the abundance gradient for each galaxy in our sample ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gradients ] , table  [ table : hiioh ] ) .",
    "our principal result is that the integrated abundance of a normal disk galaxy correlates well with its _ characteristic _ gas - phase abundance , or the  ii - region abundance measured at @xmath81 ( figs .",
    "[ fig : ohvsoh_m91 ] and [ fig : ohvsoh_pt05 ] ) .",
    "the typical scatter in the correlation is @xmath3  dex , independent of whether the @xcite or the @xcite calibration is used ( table  [ table : resid ] ) .",
    "we note , however , that the scatter in the abundance residuals is generally higher when using the pilyugin & thuan calibration .",
    "these results confirm and extend the analysis carried out by @xcite and @xcite , who used simulated integrated galaxy spectra .",
    "integrated abundances based on the observed emission - line fluxes , or the emission - line equivalent widths @xcite are susceptible to additional systematic effects of order @xmath4  dex with respect to the abundances based on the reddening - corrected fluxes , at least for the range of reddenings and stellar populations spanned by our sample .",
    "the systematic residuals using the equivalent - width method , however , can be minimized or eliminated by adopting a different value of @xmath6 ( see  [ sec : results ] and * ? ? ?",
    "we studied the residuals between the integrated and characteristic abundances of the galaxies in our sample to identify a physical origin for the source of the scatter .",
    "we found no significant correlations between the residuals and the slope of the abundance gradient , the dust reddening , the inclination angle , or the @xmath6 surface brightness ( figs .",
    "[ fig : ohresid_m91 ] and [ fig : ohresid_pt05 ] , and table  [ table : spearman ] ) .",
    "we note , however , that @xcite found that inclination can significantly bias integrated abundances , in the sense that edge - on galaxies may appear , on average , @xmath47  dex more metal - poor than face - on galaxies .    by comparing the emission - line sequences of galaxies ,  ii regions , and regions of diffuse - ionized gas",
    ", we found that the integrated [  ii]/@xmath6 and [  ii]/@xmath6 ratios of galaxies lie along the upper envelope of the sequence defined by high surface brightness  ii regions , consistent with a modest contribution from diffuse - ionized gas emission to our integrated spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ratios ] ) . by comparison ,",
    "the integrated [  iii]/@xmath9 and [  ii]/@xmath9 ratios of galaxies are relatively insensitive to contributions from diffuse - ionized gas emission , suggesting that the @xmath5 parameter is a more robust abundance diagnostic for galaxies than strong - line calibrations that rely on either [  ii ] or [  ii ] .",
    "finally , we found that the reddening - corrected integrated abundances of the galaxies in our sample were equal to the gas - phase abundance at normalized galactocentric radii ranging from @xmath47 to @xmath111 , depending on the slope of the abundance gradient . on average ,",
    "the two abundances were equal at @xmath114 , indicating that the commonly adopted radius used to define the characteristic abundance of a disk galaxy ( i.e. , @xmath115 ) is a reasonable assumption .",
    "we conclude that the integrated @xmath5 parameter of star - forming disk galaxies is a robust tracer of the gas - phase oxygen abundance , even in the presence of a variety of systematic effects .",
    "the strength of the @xmath9 , [  ii ] , and [  iii ] lines under typical nebular conditions , and their accessibility to ground - based optical spectrographs to @xmath7 , ensures that the @xmath5 parameter will continue to be used to measure the build - up of heavy elements in the interstellar media of galaxies with cosmic time .",
