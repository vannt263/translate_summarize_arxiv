    "in this chapter i consider the effects of regular alternation of the hamiltonian parameters on the quantum phase transition inherent in a one - dimensional spin-@xmath0 ising model in a transverse field . before starting to discuss this issue let me recall some common wisdoms from statistical physics .",
    "one of the aims of statistical physics is to describe different phases which may occur in many - particle systems and the transitions between different phases , i.e. the phase transitions .",
    "we often face phase transitions in everyday life .",
    "melting of ice , boiling of water or vanishing of the magnetic properties of iron after heating are well - known phenomena for everyone .",
    "normally we associate the changes in properties of a substance as the temperature varies .",
    "however , such changes may occur at a fixed finite temperature while some other parameter ( such as presssure ) varies .",
    "p.  ehrenfest proposed a classification of phase transitions . in the ehrenfest classification of phase transitions",
    "we say that the phase transition is of the order one if the free energy is continuous across the phase transition whereas its first derivatives with respect to temperature and other variables ( for example , pressure ) are discontinuous .",
    "similarly , we say that the phase transition is of the order two ( three ) if the free energy and its first derivatives ( first two derivatives ) are continuous across the phase transition whereas the second ( third ) derivatives are discontinuous .",
    "a few years later l.  landau proposed to consider discontinuous or continuous phase transitions . in the landau sense",
    "the discontinuous ( continuous ) phase transition is characterized by a discontinuous ( continuous ) change in the order parameter and , therefore , it is usually viewed as of the first- ( second- or higher- ) order . in the first - order phase transitions the two phases coexist at the phase transition temperature .",
    "thus , if ice is melting one observes two phases , i.e. , liquid and solid , which coexist at the temperature of phase transition .",
    "this is an example of discontinuous phase transition .",
    "in the second - order ( and higher - order ) phase transitions the two phases do not coexist .",
    "an example is the curie point of a ferromagnet above which the magnetic moment of a material vanishes . below the curie temperature @xmath1",
    "we can observe only the ferromagnetic phase which continuosly disappears at @xmath1 .",
    "above @xmath1 we can observe only the paramagnetic phase .",
    "some phase transitions are not in accord with the naively applied classification rules .",
    "thus , the bose - einstein condensation in an ideal bose gas is accompanied by a kink in the temperature dependence of specific heat at the bose - einstein condensation temperature but is viewed as a first - order phase transition.@xcite in what follows our focus will be on the continuous phase transitions which were studied very intensively in the last century , especially in the last four decades .",
    "statistical mechanics provides some microscopic models of the continuous phase transitions .",
    "one of such models was invented by e.  ising@xcite about 80 years ago .",
    "it became especially well - known after l.  onsager@xcite had found an exact solution of the model in two dimensions .",
    "let me introduce the ising model and fix the notations .",
    "the model consists of magnetic moments or spins which may have two values @xmath2 and @xmath0 and which interact with the nearest neighbors .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model on a square lattice of @xmath3 sites can be written in the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the spin variable attached to the site @xmath6 , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the exchange interactions in horizontal and vertical directions , respectively . if the exchange interaction in ( [ 1.01 ] ) is positive , the same value of spin variables at neighboring sites is favorable , i.e. the exchange interaction is ferromagnetic .",
    "the spin variable @xmath9 may be presented by a half of the pauli matrix @xmath10 and the canonical partition function which determines the thermodynamics of the model reads @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the inverse temperature .",
    "we are also interested in the spin correlation functions @xmath13 where the canonical average means @xmath14 the spin correlation functions in the limit of infinitely large intersite distances yield the magnetization per site @xmath15 which plays the role of the order parameter . due to the seminal study of l.  onsager we understand in great detail the properties of the two - dimensional ising model .    at zero temperature @xmath16",
    "all spins have the same value , say , @xmath0 , and @xmath17 .",
    "as the temperature becomes nonzero some of spin variables due to temperature fluctuations have the value @xmath2 , and thus @xmath18 becomes smaller than @xmath0 .",
    "quantitatively the temperature fluctuations of magnetic moment can be characterized by @xmath19 at the critical temperature @xmath1 the temperature fluctuations completely destroy the order : the average numbers of spins having the values @xmath0 and @xmath2 are the same and @xmath20 . above @xmath1 the average numbers of spins having the values @xmath0 and @xmath2 remain the same and @xmath20 .",
    "analytical calculations predict the logarithmic singularity of the specific heat in the vicinity of @xmath1 @xmath21 and the vanishing of the order parameter @xmath18 while @xmath22 as @xmath23 the correlation length @xmath24 which characterizes the long - distance behavior of spin correlations , @xmath25 diverges in the vicinity of @xmath1 as @xmath26    in one dimension @xmath27 . at any infinitesimally small temperature",
    "the temperature fluctuations destroy the long - range order which exists only at zero temperature .",
    "the exact solution@xcite for the two - point spin correlation functions reads @xmath28 and hence the correlation length @xmath24 diverges while @xmath29 as @xmath30      numerous experimental studies of different substances in the vicinity of the continuous phase transition points show that the critical behavior is characterized by a set of exponents which may be identical for different substances .",
    "this remarkable result of universality urged the researchers to proceed elaborating scaling concepts , establishing scaling relations and developing renormalization ideas and many systematic renormalization - group schemes in order to calculate critical exponents .",
    "these issues constitute a basic course in the theory of classical ( i.e. temperature - driven ) continuous phase transitions.@xcite    in what follows i shall not speak about temperature - driven continuous phase transitions .",
    "i wish to focus on the quantum continuous phase transitions .",
    "let me start from a brief discussion of the experiment performed by d.  bitko , t.  f.  rosenbaum and g.  aeppli@xcite which demonstrates how a phase transition may be driven by entirely quantum rather than temperature fluctuations .",
    "d.  bitko et al carried out their measurements for a model magnet lithium holmium fluoride lihof@xmath31 in the external field @xmath32 , which turns out to be the experimental realization of the ising magnet in a transverse magnetic field . at low temperatures ( below 2  k ) ,",
    "the magnetic properties arise owing to the magnetic dipolar interaction of the spins of neighboring holmium ions ho@xmath33 .",
    "these spins prefer to be directed either up or down with respect to a certain crystalline axis and present the three - dimensional ferromagnetic ising model .",
    "d.  bitko et al investigated the behavior of lihof@xmath31 as a function of temperature @xmath34 and an external magnetic field @xmath32 applied normally to the ising axis .",
    "for this purpose they measured the real and the imaginary parts of the magnetic susceptibility along the ising axis at different temperatures establishing @xmath1 or @xmath35 .",
    "their findings are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] .",
    "let us discuss the experimentally measured phase diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] ) of the system which is described by the hamiltonian of the ising magnet in a transverse magnetic field @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 are halves of the pauli matrices @xmath39 @xmath40s are the ising exchange couplings and @xmath41 is a transverse field . consider the behavior of the system as temperature increases at @xmath42 ( the horizontal axis in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] ) . at @xmath16 ,",
    "all spins are pointed , say , up ( i.e. , fully polarized ferromagnetic state ) .",
    "as the temperature becomes nonzero , the temperature fluctuations cause some spins of the ground - state configuration to flip , i.e. some spins become pointed down . as the temperature increases , the number of flipped spins increases and , at @xmath43  k , the numbers of up and down spins become equal .",
    "the numbers of spin up and spin down are the same for all temperatures above @xmath1 .",
    "this is a scenario of the conventional temperature - driven continuous phase transition from the ferromagnetic to the paramagnetic phase with the curie temperature @xmath43  k.    consider further what happens while we are moving along the vertical axis in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] , i.e. while we increase the transverse field @xmath32 at zero temperature @xmath16 .",
    "we immediately observe that the existing order at zero temperature may be destroyed in a completely different manner even at @xmath16 . applying transverse field @xmath32 we allow tunneling between spin - down and spin - up states . and if @xmath44 , the ground state becomes paramagnetic even at @xmath16 .",
    "hence , the quantum fluctuations destroy the order .",
    "in other words , the phase transition between ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases described by the order parameter @xmath45 is driven entirely by quantum fluctuations . for both @xmath34 and @xmath32 nonzero , d.  bitko",
    "et al found experimentally a line of continuous phase transitions which separates the ferromagnetic phase ( lower region in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] ) from the paramagnetic phase ( upper region in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] ) .",
    "for example , at @xmath46  k they found @xmath47  koe .",
    "thus , the classical phase transition at @xmath42 and the quantum phase transition at @xmath16 are connected by a line of continuous phase transitions . to develop a correct theoretical description of the equally important quantum and temperature fluctuations in this region",
    "has been a focus of many recent studies .",
    "[ [ spin - frac12-ising - chain - in - a - transverse - field - as - the - simplest - model - for - the - quantum - phase - transition - theory - secd2 ] ] spin-@xmath0 ising chain in a transverse field as the simplest model for the quantum phase transition theory [ secd2 ] ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    in early sixties of the last century e.  lieb , t.  schultz and d.  mattis@xcite ( see also the paper by s.  katsura@xcite ) suggested a new exactly solvable model , the so - called , spin-@xmath0 @xmath48 chain .",
    "in particular case it transforms into the one - dimensional spin-@xmath0 ising model in a transverse field ; this case was examined in detail several years later by p.  pfeuty.@xcite the long - known results for the ising chain in a transverse field may be viewed in the context of the quantum phase transition theory .",
    "the transverse ising chain is apparently the simplest model exhibiting the continuous quantum phase transition which can be studied in much detail since many statistical mechanics quantities for that model are amenable for rigorous calculations .",
    "i begin to discuss these results introducing the model .",
    "it consists of @xmath49 spins @xmath0 ( which are represented by halves of the pauli matrices ) which are arranged in a row .",
    "only the neighboring spins interact via the ising exchange interaction .",
    "moreover , the spins interact with an external transverse field .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model may be written as follows : @xmath50 we may impose periodic ( cyclic ) boundary conditions assuming @xmath51 or open ( free ) boundary conditions assuming the last term in the second sum in ( [ 2.01 ] ) to be zero .",
    "the ising chain without transverse field , @xmath52 , exhibits the long - range order at zero temperature @xmath16 with the order parameter @xmath53 which equals , say , @xmath0 ( we assume the exchange interaction in ( [ 2.01 ] ) to be ferromagnetic , @xmath54 ) .",
    "the long - range order is immediately destroyed , i.e. @xmath55 , for any nonzero temperature @xmath56 .",
    "however , the ising magnetization @xmath57 can be destroyed at @xmath16 by quantum fluctuations , when we switch on in ( [ 2.01 ] ) the transverse field @xmath58 .",
    "small values of @xmath41 reduce the transverse magnetizations @xmath57 and after @xmath41 exceeds the critical value @xmath59 the ising magnetization becomes zero . that is the scenario which was discussed above in connection with the low - temperature properties of lihof@xmath31 .",
    "the advantage of the introduced model ( [ 2.01 ] ) is a possibility to follow in great detail the quantum phase transition tuned by @xmath41 .",
    "just after introducing the spin-@xmath0 @xmath48 chains it was recognized that there was an intimate connection between the transverse ising chain and the square - lattice ising model ( see , for example , a redirevation of the onsager solution using the jordan - wigner fermionization@xcite ) .",
    "the relationship between these models was demonstrated explicitly by m.  suzuki.@xcite consider the square - lattice ising model ( [ 1.01 ] ) with the strength of horizontal interactions @xmath60 and with the strength of vertical interactions @xmath61 and the transverse ising chain ( [ 2.01 ] ) with the exchange interaction @xmath54 and with the transverse field @xmath41 .",
    "the thermodynamic properties of the square - lattice ising model are equivalent to the ground - state properties of the transverse ising chain under the relations@xcite @xmath62 moreover , the temperature - driven continuous phase transition in the square - lattice ising model corresponds to the transverse field - driven continuous phase transition at @xmath16 in the transverse ising chain .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath1 corresponds to the critical transverse field @xmath63 .",
    "the dependences such as the helmholtz free energy , entropy , and specific heat against temperature @xmath34 correspond to the dependences such as the ground - state energy , transverse magnetization , and static transverse susceptibility against transverse field @xmath41 .",
    "finally , the correlation length @xmath24 corresponds to the inverse energy gap @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",

    "now i wish to explain briefly how can the statistical mechanics calculations for the transverse ising chain be carried out without making any approximation . in terms of the spin raising and lowering operators @xmath66",
    "the hamiltonian of the transverse ising chain becomes as follows : @xmath67 bearing in mind a case of regularly alternating chain we consider a model more general than ( [ 2.01 ] ) assuming that the hamiltonian parameters are site - dependent , @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "although ( [ 2.03 ] ) is a bilinear form in terms of @xmath70 operators , further calculations appear to be complicated because of the commutation relations which are of the fermi type at the same site @xmath71 and of the bose type at different sites @xmath72 = \\left[s_n^-,s_m^-\\right ] = \\left[s_n^+,s_m^+\\right]=0 , \\;\\;\\ ;",

    "namely , @xmath76 where @xmath77 @xmath78 for periodic boundary conditions imposed on ( [ 2.03 ] ) , the transformed hamiltonian ( [ 2.09 ] ) should also contain the so - called boundary term which is omitted since we send @xmath79 to infinity .    to diagonalize a bilinear in fermi operators form ( [ 2.09 ] )",
    "we perform the linear canonical transformation with real coefficients @xmath80 the resulting hamiltonian becomes as follows : @xmath81 if the coefficients @xmath82 , @xmath83 or , more precisely , their linear combinations @xmath84 satisfy the set of equations @xmath85 eqs .",

    "further , @xmath109 @xmath110 note that the relations between the operators @xmath111 , @xmath112 and the fermi operators are nonlocal since the r.h.s . in eqs .",

    "namely , @xmath123 the r.h.s . of eq .",

    "on the other hand , the pfaffian may be computed directly,@xcite noting that @xmath130 and that @xmath131    let me finally show how the results for the transverse ising chain obtained by p.  pfeuty@xcite arise in the described approach . recalling eq .",
    "( [ 2.13 ] ) ( or eq . ( [ 2.21 ] ) ) it is not hard to see that the ground - state energy per site can be written as @xmath132 where @xmath133 and @xmath134 is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind.@xcite in the vicinity of @xmath135 @xmath136 ( see ref . ) and therefore in the vicinity of @xmath137 the ground - state energy ( [ 2.41 ] ) contains the nonanalytic contribution @xmath138 as a result the ground - state transverse magnetization contains the nonanalytic contribution @xmath139 and the ground - state static transverse susceptibility exhibits a logarithmic singularity @xmath140 at @xmath137 the energy spectrum is gapless , i.e. there is a zero - energy elementary excitation . in the vicinity of @xmath137",
    "the energy gap is given by the smallest value of @xmath141 and hence @xmath142    to end up the discussion of the ground - state properties of the transverse ising chain , let me emphasize that the quantum phase transition appears since the spin variables are the q - numbers rather than the c - numbers . to demonstrate this explicitly we may consider spin - vector ( instead of spin - matrix ) transverse ising chain .",
    "the model consists of @xmath49 3-componet vectors @xmath143 which are governed by the hamiltonian @xmath144 here @xmath145 is the value of the spin which plays only a quantitative role and further is put @xmath146 . to obtain the ground - state energy we should place all spins in @xmath147 plane putting @xmath148 ( @xmath149 ) .",
    "moreover , the angles @xmath150 must minimize the sum of contributions due to the interaction with the field and due to the intersite interaction .",
    "thus , the ground - state energy ansatz reads @xmath151 where @xmath152 is determined to minimize @xmath153 ( [ 2.47 ] ) .",
    "obviously @xmath154 as a result , we find that the ground - state energy per site is given by @xmath155 moreover , the @xmath156- and @xmath157-magnetizations which can be obtained after inserting ( [ 2.48 ] ) into the formulas @xmath158 and @xmath159 , respectively , behave as @xmath160 and @xmath161 respectively .",
    "evidently , there is no singularity in the ground - state dependence of the static transverse susceptibility @xmath162 on the transverse field @xmath41 . as the transverse field increases from zero to @xmath163 , the on - site magnetic moments smoothly change their direction from @xmath156- to @xmath157-axis .",
    "the quantum phase transition appears only due to the quantum fluctuations which arise when the spin components do not commute and no phase transition occurs when the spin components are classical variables ( compare fig .",

    "note , that there was a great deal of work done examining the effects of different modifications of the skeleton model on the quantum phase transition .",

    "to summarize , i have shown how the exact results for the thermodynamics of a regularly alternating spin-@xmath0 ising chain in a transverse field can be derived using the jordan - wigner transformation and continued fractions .",
    "furthermore , for special parameter values the exact ground - state wave function and spin correlation functions can be obtained as well . for parameters for which the correlation functions are not accessible for rigorous analytical analysis",

    "we can extract the order parameter and the correlation length in high precision .",
    "we have found , that the quantum phase transition occurring in the uniform transverse ising chain is not suppressed by deviation from uniformity in the form of a regular alternation of bonds and fields . on the contrary",
    ", field alternation may lead to the appearance of additional quantum phase transitions tuned by the field .",
    "the number of phase transitions for a given period of alternation strongly depends on the precise values of the parameters of the model .",
    "we have examined the critical behavior of the energy gap @xmath64 , the ground - state energy @xmath262 , the transverse magnetization @xmath18 , and the static transverse susceptibility @xmath278 and have found the same critical indices both for a nonuniform and uniform chain . for some sets of the hamiltonian parameters , the ground - state quantities may exhibit a weak singularity .      in the remainder of this chapter",
    "i shall discuss another simple models which , apart from the transverse ising chain , exhibit a quantum phase transition .",
    "namely , i consider the spin-@xmath0 isotropic @xmath48 ( i.e. @xmath337 ) chain in a transverse field and the spin-@xmath0 @xmath338 chain in an external magnetic field directed along @xmath157 axis focusing on the effects of regularly alternating hamiltonian parameters on the dependence of the ground - state quantities on the external field .",
    "the uniform transverse @xmath337 chain described by the hamiltonian @xmath339 by employing the jordan - wigner transformation ( [ 2.06 ] ) , ( [ 2.07 ] ) can be mapped onto the system of noninteracting spinless fermions with the hamiltonian @xmath340 where the elementary excitation energies @xmath341 are given by @xmath342 alternatively , we may find the density of states @xmath100 ( [ 2.22 ] ) which is given by @xmath343 as a result , the thermodynamic properties of the spin chain ( [ 5.01 ] ) can be easily analyzed .",
    "in contrast to the transverse ising chain ( and to any chain with anisotropic @xmath48 interaction in a transverse field ) @xmath344 commutes with the hamiltonian describing the isotropic @xmath48 interspin interaction and , therefore , a change in the transverse field @xmath41 has a different effect on the ground - state quantities of the spin chain ( [ 5.01 ] ) . as can be seen from ( [ 5.02 ] ) , ( [ 5.03 ] ) the transverse field plays a role of the chemical potential controlling a filling of the fermion band .",
    "the transverse @xmath337 chain remains gapless until @xmath345 .",
    "if @xmath346 exceeds @xmath163 , the energy gap @xmath64 opens linearly .",

    "after the jordan - wigner transformation ( [ 2.06 ] ) , ( [ 2.07 ] ) the hamiltonian can be readily diagonalized ( see refs . ) .",

    "these outcomes suggest that some basic features of the fully interacting system ( [ 5.06 ] ) are captured by the free fermion picture .",
