    "it is known that computing the independence number of an intersection graph is np - hard @xcite , even for very simple objects such as rectangles and disks in the plane @xcite . however , due to its applications in vlsi design @xcite , map labeling @xcite , and elsewhere , a lot of research has been devoted to developing polynomial - time approximation schemes ( ptas ) for computing the independence number of intersection graphs ( see @xcite for more references ) . in this paper , we study the independence number of the intersection graph of edges in a complete simple topological graph .",
    "a _ topological graph _ is a graph drawn in the plane such that its vertices are represented by points and its edges are represented by non - self - intersecting arcs connecting the corresponding points .",
    "the arcs are allowed to intersect , but they may not intersect vertices except for their endpoints . furthermore , no three edges have a common interior point and no two edges are tangent , i.e. , if two edges share an interior point , then they must properly cross at that point in common .",
    "a topological graph is _ simple _ if every pair of its edges intersect at most once .",
    "two edges of a topological graph _ cross _ if their interiors share a point , and are _ disjoint _ if they neither share a common vertex nor cross .",

    ", every complete @xmath0-vertex simple topological graph contains @xmath6 edges that are either pairwise disjoint or pairwise crossing .",
    "however , it was suspected @xcite that this bound is far from optimal . fox and pach @xcite showed that there exists a constant @xmath7 , such that every complete @xmath0-vertex simple topological graph contains @xmath8 pairwise crossing edges .",

    "we note that the previous two bounds hold for dense simple topological graphs .",
    "pach and tth conjectured ( see problem 5 of chapter 9.5 in @xcite ) that there exists a constant @xmath13 such that every complete @xmath0-vertex simple topological graph has at least @xmath8 pairwise disjoint edges .",

    "in this section , we will recall one of the most useful parameters measuring the complexity of a set system : the dual shatter function .",
    "all of the following concepts and results can be found in chapter 5 of @xcite .",
    "let @xmath14 be a set system with ground set @xmath15 , such that @xmath15 is finite .",
    "the _ dual shatter function _ of @xmath14 is a function , denoted by @xmath16 , whose value at @xmath17 is defined as the maximum number of equivalence classes on @xmath15 defined by an @xmath17-element subfamily @xmath18 , where two points @xmath19 are equivalent with respect to @xmath20 if @xmath21 belongs to the same sets of @xmath20 as @xmath22 does . in other words , @xmath23 is the maximum number of nonempty cells in the venn diagram of @xmath17 sets of @xmath24 .",
    "one of the main tools used to prove theorem  [ main ] is the following result of chazelle and welzl on matchings with low stabbing number .",
    "a similar approach was done by pach in @xcite , who showed that every @xmath0-vertex complete geometric graph contains @xmath25 pairwise parallel edges , where two edges are _ parallel _ if they are the opposite sides of a convex quadrilateral .",
    "given a set system @xmath14 and a graph @xmath26 , we say that a set @xmath27 _ stabs _ edge @xmath28 if @xmath29 .",
    "the _ stabbing number of @xmath5 with respect to the set @xmath30 _ is the number of edges of @xmath5 stabbed by @xmath30 , and the _ stabbing number of @xmath5 _ is the maximum of stabbing numbers of @xmath5 with respect to all sets of @xmath24 .",
