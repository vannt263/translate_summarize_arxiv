    "the compact , thermal ( i. e. free - free ) radio sources found at centimeter wavelengths in regions of star formation can have different natures . some of them are ultracompact or hypercompact hii regions , photoionized by an embedded hot luminous star .",
    "other sources are clumps of gas or even circumstellar disks that are being externally ionized by a nearby star , such as the orion proplyds ( e. g. odell & wong 1996 ; zapata et al .",
    "2004 ) and the bright - rimmed clouds ( e.g. carrasco - gonzalez et al . 2006 ) .",
    "an additional class of sources is formed by the thermal jets , collimated outflows that emanate from young stars and whose ionization is most probably maintained by the interaction of the moving gas with the surrounding medium ( eisloffel et al .",
    "2000 ) . finally , there are also some examples of `` radio herbig - haro '' objects , obscured knots of gas that are being collisionally ionized by the shock produced by a collimated outflow ( e. g. curiel et al .",
    "there are also compact non - thermal sources , of which the most common are the young low - mass stars with active magnetospheres that produce gyrosynchrotron emission ( e.g. feigelson & montmerle 1999 ) .",

    "1991 ; garay et al .",
    "1996 ) .    to advance in the understanding of the nature of these compact radio sources it is necessary to have good quality data that allows the observer to establish the angular size , the morphology , the spectral index , the time variability , the polarization , and the presence of proper motions in them .",
    "only a handful of the known star - forming regions have been studied carefully enough to clearly establish the nature of its compact radio sources .",

    "; shepherd et al .",
    ". however , shepherd ( 2001 ) had pointed that vla 1 does not appear to contribute significantly to the energetics of the large - scale outflow .",

    "a detailed very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) study of the water maser cluster morphology and kinematics in the vicinity of these two radio sources by torrelles et al .",
    "( 2003 ) showed remarkably different outflow ejection geometries among them ( vla 1 has a collimated , jetlike outflow , while vla 2 has a shell outflow expanding in multiple directions ) .",
    "this is a surprising result given that both objects are separated by only 1400 au and share the same environment .",
    "vla 3 was found to have deconvolved dimensions of @xmath4 @xmath5 at 1.3 cm by torrelles et al .",
    "this source is also detected at mid - infrared wavelengths , with a bolometric luminosity of   750  l@xmath6 ( persi , tapia , & smith 2006 ) .",
    "the physical parameters of the ionized gas in vla 1 , vla 2 , vla 3 , and bc , as well as the more evolved w75n(a ) are all consistent with each being powered by a zams star of spectral type between b0 and b2 ( shepherd et al .",
    "the present evidence is consistent with an independent exciting source of this spectral type for each radio continuum component , but the results presented in this paper suggest a likely alternative interpretation .    in this paper",
    "we analyze very large array ( vla ) and _ chandra _ archive data of the region , mostly searching for variability and proper motions that could help in a better understanding of the radio sources .",
    "the parameters of the vla archive observations used in this study are summarized in table 1 .",
    "all the data were calibrated following the standard vla procedures .",
    "the flux calibrators and the name and bootstrapped flux density of the phase calibrators used in each observation are given in table 1 .",
    "in the following sections we describe in more detail the radio and x - ray observations .      in figure 1 we show the continuum images of the central region of w75n at 3.6 cm ( 2006.38 ) and 2 cm ( 2001.31 ) .",
    "as can be seen in this figure , to the south of the previously known components ( vla 1 , vla 2 , vla 3 and bc ) , we detected a new radio source , vla 4 .",
    "this source was not detected in the other continuum images discussed here ( see below ) , most probably because they are noiser than the 2006 image at 3.6 cm . in table 2",
    "we show the positions of the five sources ( from the 3.6 cm 2006 data ) with their flux densities at both wavelengths ( 3.6 and 2 cm ) and their spectral indices in this wavelength range .",
    "we note that since some of the sources are time - variable ( see below ) , these spectral indices are not very reliable .",
    "three of the sources ( vla  1 , bc , and vla  4 ) have flat spectral indices within the error , a result consistent with optically thin free - free emission .",
    "source vla  3 has a spectral index of 0.6@xmath70.1 , consistent with the value expected for a thermal jet .",
    "the source with the steepest spectral index is vla  2 , that with a value of 2.2@xmath70.3 suggests optically thick free - free emission .    in figure 2",
    "we compare the three 3.6 cm images made from data taken in 1992 , 1998 , and 2006 .",
    "since these observations were not made with the same phase calibrator ( see table 1 ) , we aligned them by assuming that the position of vla 3 was the same at all three epochs and using the 2006 position for all of them .",
    "this alignment involved small position shifts of @xmath8 .",
    "in particular , the shift of the 1998 image to align it with the 2006 image was of only @xmath9 . of the sources in the region ,",
    "only source bc shows important changes in position .",
    "its average proper motion , @xmath10 toward the south , over a time of 13.48 years at a distance of 2 kpc , implies an average velocity in the plane of the sky of 220@xmath770 km s@xmath11 .",
    "however , as can be seen in figure 2 , most of the displacement took place between the last two epochs , so the velocity between these two last epochs is possibly larger .",
    "in addition to the proper motions , there is a dramatic change in flux density and morphology of source bc at 3.6 cm . in 1992",
    "it was a weak compact source ( with a flux density of 0.9@xmath70.2 mjy ) , becoming brighter ( 2.7@xmath70.5 mjy ) and elongated in 1998 ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the position does not seem to change significantly between these two epochs .",
    "finally , in 2006 the source remained bright ( 3.3@xmath70.2 mjy ) and appears as broken in two components .",
    "furthermore , it has clearly moved to the south .        using vla archive data",
    ", we obtained the image for the j = 10 ; v = 0 emission of the sio molecule ( 43.423858 ghz ) in the w75n region shown in the left panel of figure 3 .",

    "since these observations did not include an ad hoc bandpass calibrator , we were forced to use as bandpass calibrators the flux ( 1331 + 305 ) and phase ( 2012 + 464 ) calibrators .",

    "we show the large scale emission of the ammonia .",
    "the main result of this image is that the region of active star formation in w75n appears to be located at the intersection of two molecular filaments , one with emission in the lsr radial velocity range of @xmath125 to 8 km s@xmath11 and the other with emission in the lsr radial velocity range of @xmath129 to 13 km s@xmath11 . in particular ,",
    "the five continuum sources are located at the intersection zone , which is also the hottest zone .",
    "this suggests that the star formation in w 75n is being triggered by the collision of molecular filaments .",

    "an image from the 2.0  10.0 kev emission is shown in figure 7 .",
    "the two detected sources could be marking the positions of termination shocks of the outflows of the cluster of sources in w75n .",
    "better data are required to determine the nature of the x - ray emission .",
    "as commented in section 2.1 , the source bc shows changes in its position , flux density and morphology .",
    "the source seems to be moving to the south with a velocity larger than 200 km s@xmath11 while it breaks into two components and dramatically increases its total flux density .",
    "this behavior is similar to that observed in optical ( devine et al .",
    "2009 ) and radio ( curiel et al . 1993 ) herbig - haro objects , and , therefore , we interpret source bc as an obscured radio hh object .",
    "its radio luminosity ( 3.3 mjy in 2006 , at a distance of 2 kpc ) makes it one of the brightest hh objects detected in the radio .",
    "it is comparable to , but significantly above , hh 80 and hh 81 that have centimeter flux densities of 1 - 2 mjy at a distance of 1.7 kpc ( mart  et al . 1993 ) .",
    "the radio luminosity of source bc is exceeded only by the radio hh objects associated with the luminous protostar iras  16547 - 4247 , that with flux densities of @xmath123 - 4 mjy at a distance of 2.9 kpc ( rodrguez et al .",
    "2008 ) are the brightest known .",
    "the radio flux density from source bc allows to make an estimate of the mechanical luminosity of the jet that drives this source . assuming that the continuum emission is optically - thin free - free at an electron temperature of @xmath24 k , and taking into account that the source is at a distance of 2 kpc , in the order of @xmath25 ionizations per second are needed to maintain the source ionized .",
    "if these ionizations have a collisional origin and assuming that a minimum energy of 13.6 ev is needed per ionization , a mechanical luminosity of @xmath26 is estimated . finally , assuming that the jet has a velocity of @xmath27 km s@xmath11 , a mass loss rate of order @xmath28 yr@xmath11 is inferred for the jet that is producing source bc .",
    "these results lead to a revision of the nature of the radio sources in w75n . as commented above , source bc is most probably a bow shock produced by a jet .",
    "several arguments suggest that this jet is driven by vla 3 : i ) the source bc and possibly vla 4 move away from vla 3 , and this source is elongated in the direction of motion , ii ) the spectral index is consistent with that expected for a radio jet , and iii ) vla 3 is the only source that has associated sio emission ( presumably tracing an outflow ) and associated 7 mm ( shepherd et al . 2004 ) and 1 mm ( shepherd 2001 ) continuum emission , suggesting association with a disk or envelope .",
    "vla 4 is either an independent star or could be a previous ejection from vla 3 .",
    "unfortunately , vla 4 is not detected at 3.6 cm in 1992 or 1998 , but a comparison of the 3.6 cm data from 2006 and of the 2 cm data from 2001 suggests a small displacement to the south .",
    "new sensitive observations are needed to test this hypothesis .",
    "finally , vla 2 is most probably an independent , very young star .",
    "this source was associated with the very strong oh flare emission that reached in 2003 an emission of about 1000 jy to become the brightest galactic oh maser in history ( alakoz et al . 2005 ; slysh & migenes 2006 ) .      under the light of these results",
    ", one could propose that vla 1 is the northern bow shock produced by the vla 3 jet .",
    "however , in contrast to source bc , vla 1 does not show detectable proper motions along the axis of the vla 3 jet .",
    "this behavior could be due to the existence of dense gas to its north that blocks motion along that direction .",
    "in fact , as shown previously , vla 1 is associated with dense gas traced by the nh@xmath13 observations .",
    "vla 1 does show , however , a displacement in the peak of emission from east to west ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , nearly perpendicular to the axis of vla 3 and similar to that observed in the radio hh objects associated with iras  16547 - 4247 ( rodrguez et al .",
    "2008 ) . in this latter source , this kinematic behavior has been interpreted as working surfaces where a precessing jet is interacting with a very dense medium . in this case",
    ", the hh objects would trace the present point of interaction between the jet and the dense medium .",
    "we think , however , most likely that vla 1 simply traces an independent young massive star .",
    "this source is known to be associated with intense maser emission from several molecules : water vapor ( e.g. , lekht et al .",
    "2009 ) , methanol ( e.g. , surcis et al . 2009 ) , and hydroxil ( e.g. fish & reid 2007 ) .",
    "intense maser emission is usually tracing the nearby presence of a young high - mass star .",
    "the proper motions observed in the water masers along the major axis of the vla 1 source also favor this scenario ( torrelles et al .",
    "the linear polarization of the methanol masers revealing a tightly ordered magnetic field over more than 2000 au around vla 1 with a strength of 50 mg gives further support to the hypothesis that vla 1 harbors a massive young star ( surcis et al .",
    "it is relevant to note that the flux density of vla 1 remained constant within the noise during the three epochs of 3.6 cm observations , with all values consistent with 4.0@xmath70.2 mjy .",
    "we have analyzed vla and _ chandra _ archive data of the w75n region . in the radio continuum ,",

    "its average velocity in the plane of the sky is 220@xmath770 km s@xmath11 .",
    "if our interpretation is correct , this is one of the brightest radio hh objects known .",
