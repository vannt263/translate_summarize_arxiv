    "although the lightest spin - triplet s - wave and p - wave bottomonia have been known experimentally for many years@xcite , the spin singlets have just been discovered in recent experiments@xcite . beyond",
    "the p waves only the @xmath3 has been observed so far@xcite .",
    "meanwhile , additional resonances , which may have an interpretation as four - quark combinations , are being found with masses in the bottomonium region@xcite . also ,",
    "observation of the @xmath4 has recently been claimed , though with a surprisingly small mass@xcite .",
    "dynamical lattice qcd computations of the masses of s - wave and p - wave bottomonia , including radial excitations , appear in @xcite .",
    "although some of these publications also commented on d - wave states , the first lattice study of the full set of d - wave quantum numbers is very recent@xcite .",
    "there are many important reasons for extending lattice studies to higher angular momentum states .",
    "d waves and f waves provide an opportunity to confirm and refine lattice methods , such as lattice nrqcd that uses a nonrelativistic expansion for the valence quarks@xcite .",
    "quantitative predictions for the masses can subsequently be tested experimentally , and comparison of reliable lattice results with today s phenomenological models can offer insights into various model assumptions . in particular , the spectrum as a function of orbital angular momentum compared to radial excitations depends on the spatial behavior of the quark - antiquark interaction . extending the study of bottomonium to higher partial waves",
    "augments the information gained by the observation of radial excited states .",
    "the lightest g - wave bottomonium is expected to lie just below the @xmath5 threshold with f waves further below and h waves above@xcite , so these bottomonium channels offer an opportunity for using lattice qcd to study threshold issues in detail , and to confirm which side of threshold the g waves are on .",
    "furthermore , knowledge of the bottomonium masses will be crucial for understanding the four - quark candidates and any other exotic hadrons that could be nearby .",
    "eventually , radiative transitions among these states could be considered@xcite .",
    "in general , a lattice operator will couple to all hadrons with the corresponding quantum numbers , but the lightest hadron will have the cleanest signal . often the lightest hadron provides the only usable signal in a lattice study . as a result of cubic symmetry , there are just 20 mutually orthogonal @xmath0 options available to lattice simulations .",
    "specifically , the 20 options originate from the reduction of continuum angular momentum @xmath6 to the five lattice octahedral representations @xmath1 , each with @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "all s - wave and p - wave bottomonium states are included in that list of 20 `` ground states '' , along with just 10 higher waves .",
    "all other continuum bottomonium quantum numbers are only accessible as excited states in the 20 channels .",
    "as well , any hybrids , exotics , and multiquark states would also be included within the list of 20 possible lattice channels .",
    "it is not known , _ a priori _ , which hadron is actually the lightest in a given @xmath0 channel .",
    "for example , the quark model suggests that a @xmath9 bottomonium state will be the lightest in one of the 20 channels , but that same channel will couple to a @xmath10 exotic hadron if one exists . to discover which is the lighter state ,",
    "it is necessary to perform an explicit lattice simulation and analysis .",
    "identifying the lightest mass in each of the 20 channels is a natural starting point for lattice qcd explorations of bottomonia at higher angular momentum .",
    "the specific contributions of the present work are twofold .",
    "first , a set of quark - antiquark creation operators for all 20 combinations of lattice quantum numbers is constructed and the lowest continuum angular momentum is identified . secondly , numerical simulations are used to show that many of the higher angular momentum bottomonium states are accessible using present lattice qcd methods and existing gauge field configurations .",
    "conservation of angular momentum is a consequence of invariance under spatial rotations , and is realized as a tower of representations labeled by non - negative integers @xmath11 . on a spatially cubic lattice ,",
    "this symmetry is reduced to the five irreducible representations @xmath12 of the octahedral group@xcite .",
    "the well - known correspondence between @xmath6 and @xmath1 is given in table  [ tab : j2lambda ] .",

[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the @xmath14 mass in table  [ tab : energies ] is consistent with the belle measurement and larger than the pdg average : @xmath15 it should be noted that this lattice result is consistent with some lattice determinations that predated the belle measurement@xcite .",
    "studies of specific aspects of this issue are also available in @xcite .",
    "the p - wave and d - wave states are in reasonable agreement with the available experimental measurements , but splittings among d waves are not resolved , in contrast to @xcite .",
    "the three f - wave results from table  [ tab : energies ] , @xmath16 are in excellent agreement with a model prediction of 10.37 gev@xmath17@xcite .",
    "the two g - wave results from table  [ tab : energies ] , @xmath18 are about one standard deviation above the experimental @xmath5 threshold at 10.56 gev@xmath17 . recalling that the quoted lattice uncertainties are statistical only , our results are also reasonably close to the model prediction of 10.52 gev@xmath17@xcite ( which , however , lies below the @xmath5 threshold ) .    fits to lattice data in h - wave and i - wave channels could only support three or four exponentials , had no stout links , and lay above the @xmath5 threshold , so meaningful mass predictions were not obtained .",

    "one finds that the ground - state p - wave states have masses not very different from the first s - wave radial excitations .",
    "there is at least some resemblance to the expectation from a coulomb - like potential .",
    "the situation changes as angular momentum is increased . at g waves",

    "perhaps the most important conclusion about g waves in this work is that statistical errors are small enough to warrant future systematic lattice study to determine , for example , whether the g waves lie above or below threshold .",

    "our present work relies on local operators for the s waves , but our previous work@xcite included smearing and thus produced a more precise result for the @xmath4 mass .",
    "since it was not reported explicitly in that publication , we include it here : @xmath27 where the error is statistical only .",
    "this hyperfine splitting is significantly smaller than the recently announced experimental measurement@xcite , @xmath28 mev@xmath17 , but our result is consistent with other lattice predictions@xcite as tabulated in @xcite .",
    "the study of bottomonium at increasing angular momentum provides knowledge that augments that obtained from the spectrum of radial excitations . in this paper",
    "we provide a set of operators in lattice nrqcd for higher angular momentum bottomonium states and explore the feasibility of their use in numerical simulations .",
    "a set of quark - antiquark operators for all lattice irreducible representations , @xmath0 , has been given in table  [ tab:20ops ] . in principle , this set of operators allows for bottomonium states with 16 distinct continuum @xmath2 combinations to be described as ground states in their respective lattice channels .",
    "all the s- and p - wave states are in this set .",
    "however , for higher angular momentum , some continuum @xmath2 combinations would only appear in @xmath0 channels where a lower angular momentum state is present .",
    "these states would have to be extracted from lattice simulations as excited states . since ground state energies are much easier to determine from lattice simulations , the states described by the operators in table  [ tab:20ops ] are a natural starting point for numerical studies of the high angular momentum states of bottomonium .",
    "our numerical simulations produced clear signals for s- , p- , d- , f- and g - wave states as displayed in fig .  [ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "these are the first lattice simulations of f - wave and g - wave bottomonium , and they are near quark model expectations .",
    "the g waves are very close to the physical @xmath5 threshold , and statistical errors in the lattice simulation are small enough to encourage future studies of the systematic errors so that lattice methods can ultimately predict with confidence whether the g waves lie above or below threshold .",
    "table  [ tab:20ops ] contains ground - state operators for h , i and l waves also , though these will be significantly above the @xmath5 threshold .",
    "we are grateful to the pacs - cs collaboration for making their dynamical gauge field configurations available .",
    "thanks the ect * in trento for support , and the organizers of `` beautiful mesons and baryons on the lattice '' for the opportunity to participate while this research was in its final stages .",
