    "the non - linearity caused by gravitational clustering can be described in two effects : _ mode spawning _ by the quadratic and higher - order terms and _ mode merging _ leading to modulation of the amplitudes and phases .",

    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we re - visit some useful technical background : the commonly - used statistical tools and theories : the power spectrum and two - point covariance functions , the linear theory of cosmological density perturbations , and the zeldovich approximation which in one dimension provides the insight on phase coupling . in section 3",

    "when the density perturbation is small , evolution of the density contrast can be obtained analytically through the _ linear perturbation theory _ from 3 coupled partial differential equations .",

    "the wavenumbers of the spawned modes are formed from combination of any 2 wavenumbers of the first order ( the same as the toy model ) and the phases follow the _ wavenumber - phase harmonic relation_. some terms may appear even at the earliest stage ( when @xmath90 ) .",

    "the bispectrum , @xmath115 , the two - dimensional fourier transform of @xmath106 , for case ii is @xmath116 trivially , whereas @xmath117 consists of a single spike located somewhere in the region of @xmath118 space defined by @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 . if @xmath122 then the spike appears at @xmath123 , @xmath124 .",
    "thus the bispectrum is the lowest order of polyspectra that measures the phase coupling induced by quadratic non - linearities when the wavenumber - phase harmonic relation holds .",
    "however , bispectrum is trivially zero again if such harmonic relation is broken .",
    "note that this relation is easily broken by mode merging when a third phase is involved .",
    "following the same line of thought , we can extend this toy model from eq.([eq : thirdorder ] ) to the case iii , @xmath125 and the case iv for comparison , @xmath126 where @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath110 and @xmath127 are random .",
    "the bispectrum for both cases are zero , but the trispectrum , the three - dimensional fourier transform of the reduced four - point covariance function , can pick up cubic phase coupling for case iii ( 24 terms ) , whereas it is again trivially zero for case iv .",
    "the third - order term produces cubic phase coupling to which bispectrum is blind .",
    "therefore , bispectrum only measures phase coupling at the second - order . during density clustering , however , mode spawning will produce the bispectrum from case i , @xmath128 is not always non - zero .",
    "mode merging breaking the wavenumber - phase harmonic relation results in zero bispectrum .",
    "the same would happen to all polyspectra .",
    "although we only demonstrate with 1d toy model the relationship between bispectrum and quadratic phase coupling , a full treatment of such relationship is elaborated in watts & coles : a non - zero bispectrum can only be produced when the @xmath10 vectors form a triangle in @xmath129-space , wherein the same ( quadratic ) wavenumber - phase harmonic relation has to hold .",
    "phase coupling is not registered only in bispectrum , but in all polyspectra .",
    "in this section , we perform 1d za numerically in order to demonstrate mode spawning and coupling into highly non - linear regime . due to limitation on integration in lagrangian coordinate , in the previous section",
    "we can analyze only the onset of non - linearity by assuming @xmath130 . in the following simulations we assume the periodic boundary condition , @xmath131      here we supply three different initial velocity potential functions to the simulations .",
    "we choose the velocity potential field with the following form for fig .",

    "[ 7_11.1 ] and @xmath136 and @xmath137 in fig .",
    "[ 7_11.2 ] , respectively .",
    "as described in previous sections , once the clustering proceeds , @xmath133 and @xmath134 will feed as phases of two parent modes with wavenumber 7 and 11 in these cases : @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "these specially chosen wavenumbers @xmath140 and @xmath141 for both fig .",
    "[ 7_11.1 ] and [ 7_11.2 ] are `` non - interactive '' in the sense that the phases of spawned modes have only one primary combination from the parent ones .",

    "so the phase of the spawned mode with , for example , wavenumber @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) can only come from addition of the phases of the parent modes , in other words , @xmath144 .",
    "in addition to the two simulations of `` non - interactive '' mode spawning , in fig .",

    "one can see now , with this extra parent mode , the spawned wavenumber @xmath147 , for example , can have two combinations : @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",

    "we using the following representation in order to display simultaneously the amplitude and phase evolution for each fourier mode .",
    "each small panel represents one fourier mode with denoted wavenumber .",
    "we divide the simulations ( up to the shell crossing ) into 20 time steps with each step represented by one diamond symbol . in each panel",
    "the amplitudes of different time steps are shown in logarithmic scale by the distances to the origin , and the phases by the angles against the positive @xmath153 axis ( similar to a complex - plane representation but only the magnitudes in logarithmic scale ) .",
    "we have to multiply all the amplitudes by @xmath154 so that they are always positive after taking the logarithm .",
    "thus the dotted circles with radius 5 units in each panel indicate a level of fourier amplitudes @xmath155 .    in fig .",
    "[ 7_11.1 ] the radial dotted lines are angles with increments of @xmath135 to show that phases aligned with angles of multiple @xmath135 ( which is due to combination of @xmath156 and @xmath157 ) . the dash lines are the predicted phases from wavenumber - phase harmonic relation according to table  [ harmonic ] .",
    "one can easily see in fig.[7_11.1 ] that the parent modes @xmath158 and 11 have higher initial amplitudes than other modes for the start .",
    "we specifically designate 7 small panels in one row so that in each column the increment of the wavenumber is 7 . because wavenumber 7 is one of the parent modes , phases of the spawned modes are formed by addition of @xmath138 , following wavenumber - phase harmonic relation .",
    "for instance , for the wavenumbers of the fourier modes 18 ( @xmath159 ) , 25 ( @xmath160 ) , 32 ( @xmath161 ) , 39 ( @xmath162 ) , 46 ( @xmath163 ) , their phases are formed from @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 , an increment of @xmath138 ( see table  [ harmonic ] for the details of phase combination from the parent modes ) .",

    "the wavenumbers of parent lowest - frequency mode ( @xmath169 ) can easily be added ( or subtracted ) to form precisely the spawned wavenumbers , particularly for high - frequency modes , so the phase of the lowest @xmath129 mode would inevitably take part in most of the hight @xmath129 mode spawning .",

    "in this paper , we use 1d za to illustrate some non - linear effects induced by gravitational clustering : mode spawning and mode coupling .",
    "we first demonstrate the onset of non - linearity by expanding the density contrast in terms of power series of @xmath45 .",
    "the second - order of such expansion reflects quadratic density fields , from which modes are spawned with phases following a special wavenumber - phase harmonic relation .",

    "@xmath218 could give a zero bispectrum due to the interaction between the spawned modes in @xmath219 with the parent ones in @xmath11 , hence resulting in a false signature of gaussianity .",
    "moreover , the blindness of bispectrum to higher - order phase coupling indicates that a complete hierarchy of polyspectra is required to fully characterize the statistical properties of a fluctuation field .",
    "the initial power spectral index decides the clustering morphology , which is closely related to fourier phases @xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to examine the link between gaussian random fields with different initial power spectral index , the only available information , and evolved morphology with information encoded in phases rather than in amplitudes .",
    "the 1d za simulations in this paper can be considered as from initial white noise power spectrum with spectral index @xmath220 ( as the coefficients of cosine functions in the velocity potential are all unity ) .",
    "it is clear that mode spawning is independent of amplitudes of the parent modes , but mode merging and coupling is rather dependent on the amplitudes of spawned modes , which are originated from parent ones . how the information is transferred from fourier amplitudes to different phase coupling configurations",
