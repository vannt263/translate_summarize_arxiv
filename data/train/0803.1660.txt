    "ngc 5102 is a member of the centaurus group of galaxies and exhibits the classical morphological characteristics of an s0 galaxy .",
    "still , ngc 5102 has other properties that are not typical of the s0 class .",
    "for example , ngc 5102 has bluer colors and the spectrum has deeper balmer absorption lines ( gallagher , faber , & balick 1975 ) than is typical for this type of object .",
    "ngc 5102 is also one of the most hi - rich s0s known .",
    "much of the hi is in an annulus centered at 3.5 arcmin radius , and such an hi distribution is unique among s0s ( van woerden et al .",
    "while the dust temperature of ngc 5102 inferred from iras observations is not peculiar for s0s , the overall dust mass is low ( van woerden et al . 1993 ) .",
    "kraft et al .",
    "( 2005 ) find a low number of x - ray binaries in ngc 5102 when compared with other early - type galaxies , and further note that the specific frequency of globular clusters is lower than in other s0s .",
    "a number of studies have examined the stellar content in the central regions of ngc 5102 .",
    "the nucleus of ngc 5102 is redder than its immediate surroundings , and is an x - ray source , suggesting that it may harbour a low - luminosity agn ( kraft et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the central regions ( van den bergh 1976 ; pritchet 1979 ) and bulge ( pritchet 1979 ) of ngc 5102 have blue colors , and there are spectroscopic signatures of a and b stars ( gallagher et al .",
    "1975 ; rocca - volmerange & guiderdoni 1987 ) .",
    "deharveng et al .",
    "( 1997 ) resolved uv - bright stars near the center of ngc 5102 .",
    "these probably formed @xmath8 myr in the past , although deharveng et al .",
    "( 1997 ) note that older post asymptotic giant branch ( pagb ) stars also have photometric properties that are similar to those of the observed objects .",
    "van den bergh ( 1976 ) discovered a ring of h@xmath9 emission .",
    "the ring has a diameter of @xmath10 kpc ( mcmillan , ciardullo , & jacoby ( 1994 ) which is similar in size to supershells in other galaxies .",
    "the center of the ring is consistent with an origin in the bulge , rather than the nucleus , and the expansion velocity is indicative of an age of only @xmath11 years ( mcmillan et al .",
    "the central regions of ngc 5102 were also an area of active star formation during intermediate epochs .",
    "bica ( 1988 ) concludes from visible wavelength spectra that roughly 54% of the central light in @xmath12 originates from a population with an age @xmath13 myr , while kraft et al .",
    "( 2005 ) model the uv - to - red spectrum and conclude that at least 55% of the stellar content originates from an intermediate - age population with an age @xmath14 gyr .",
    "recent star formation has not been restricted to the spheroid of ngc 5102 .",
    "van den bergh ( 1976 ) identified groups of young stars associated with hii regions in the south east portion of the ngc 5102 disk , while danks , laustsen , & van woerden ( 1979 ) found a number of stars that may be supergiants .",
    "mcmillan et al .",
    "( 1994 ) detected 7 hii regions in the disk , five of which are located to the south east of the galaxy center , while two are located close to the major axis in the south west quadrant .",
    "the deepest photometric investigation of the ngc 5102 disk was conducted by karachentsev et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , who used wfpc2 images to construct an @xmath15 cmd of stars in the north east portion of the galaxy .",
    "the wfpc2 cmd is dominated by a broad rgb that is indicative of a spread in age and/or metallicity .",
    "a spray of agb stars is also seen .",
    "prominent blue or red supergiant ( rsg ) sequences are not evident in these data , although the region sampled is far removed from the area that contains hii regions at the present day .",
    "studies of the spatial distribution of stars that formed during the past @xmath16 gyr will provide insights into the recent evolution of ngc 5102 , and may provide hints as to its evolutionary status in the context of other galaxies in the local universe .",
    "there are basic issues that can be addressed with moderately wide field imaging studies .",
    "for example , is there evidence for recent star formation in parts of the disk other than those that currently contain bright hii regions ?",
    "moreover , did the extensive star - forming activity that occured during intermediate epochs in the bulge extend into the disk ?",
    "if evidence for wide - spread elevated star formation rates ( sfrs ) during intermediate epochs are seen throughout the disk then this argues for a galaxy - wide star formation trigger .",
    "in contrast , if elevated sfrs were restricted to the innermost regions of the galaxy during the past few gyr then this argues for a less dramatic triggering mechanism , such as the buckling of a bar or perhaps the assimilation of a small , gas - rich companion .    in the current paper , deep @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    "images obtained with gmos - s are used to investigate the stellar content of the western portion of the ngc 5102 disk .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 filters were selected for this program as they are well - suited to the detection of the bright red agb stars that are conspicuous signatures of star formation during intermediate epochs , as well as the red rgb stars that belong to the moderately metal - rich populations that frequent the disks of spiral galaxies . while observations through the @xmath17 filter may have given more metallicity sensitivity , the integration times needed to detect the reddest agb and rgb stars in @xmath17 are prohibitive .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "details of the observations and the procedures used to reduce the data can be found in  2 , while the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) constructed from the data are presented in  3 .",
    "the properties of the young , old , and intermediate age components are the subjects of   4  6 .",
    "a summary and discussion of the results follows in  7 .",
    "ngc 5102 was observed with gmos ( crampton et al .",
    "2000 ) on the gemini south telescope as part of queue program gs-2006a - q-45 .",
    "the gmos detector is a mosaic of three @xmath18 eev ccds .",
    "the raw sampling on the sky is @xmath19 arcsec pixel@xmath3 , and the output was binned @xmath20 pixels@xmath21 during read - out .",
    "this binning allowed the final spatial sampling to better match the delivered image quality , which was measured from stars in the processed images to be 0.6 ( @xmath1 ) and 0.7 ( @xmath0 ) arcsec fwhm .    a field that is centered at 13@xmath22 10@xmath23 40@xmath24 right ascension and 36@xmath25 36@xmath26 51@xmath27 declination ( e2000 ) , and therefore samples the western half of the ngc 5102 disk ,",
    "was observed through sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xmath0 and @xmath1 filters ( fukugita et al .",
    "transmission curves for the filters used in gmos - s are available at the gemini website .",
    "the area that was observed is marked in figure 1 , which shows a section of the digitized sky survey centered on ngc 5102 .",
    "ten 450 sec exposures were recorded filter@xmath3 , and so the total exposure time is 4500 sec filter@xmath3 .",
    "a standard pipeline for the processing of visible wavelength imaging observations was applied to the data .",
    "the output from each ccd was scaled to a common gain , and the results were mosaiced to form a single image for each exposure . these were then bias - subtracted and flat - fielded .",
    "prominent interference fringes are seen in the flat - fielded @xmath1 images , and a fringe frame was constructed by median - combining flat - fielded @xmath1 images of the various centaurus group galaxies that were observed as part of this program .",
    "the target galaxies were intentionally positioned on different parts of the science detector to facilitate the suppression of galaxy light when the images of all the targets are combined to make the fringe frame .",
    "the resulting fringe frame was then subtracted from the flat - fielded ngc 5102 @xmath1 images .",
    "the telescope pointing was offset in a five point dither pattern between exposures to facilitate the filling of the gaps between the ccds in the final processed images .",
    "the flat - fielded @xmath0 and fringe subtracted @xmath1 images were spatially registered to correct for the dither offsets , and the median intensity at each aligned pixel location was computed for each filter .",
    "the final step was to trim the stacked images to the area on the sky that is common to all exposures .",
    "landolt ( 1992 ) standard stars are observed with gmos throughout each semester to provide calibration information for queue - scheduled gmos imaging observations .",
    "for the current study , standard star images that were recorded within a few weeks of the ngc 5102 observations were fetched from the gemini data archive and these were reduced using the procedures described above .",
    "while standard stars were not observed for this program on the same nights as the observations , the sky transparency was verified by the observering team at the telescope by checking satellite weather information , the brightness of the guide star , and the exposure - to - exposure photometric stability of stars in the target field .",
    "it is also standard practice for the observing team to check visually sky conditions throughout the night .",
    "the standard star magnitudes listed by landolt ( 1992 ) were transformed into the sdss system using the relations defined by smith et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , so that the photometric calibration is in the sdss system .",
    "the instrumental brightnesses of the standard stars were measured from the reduced images in apertures that sampled the stellar psf past the point where it blended with the sky background .",
    "the standard star observations were made near the meridian , and so extinction coefficients could not be calculated .",
    "lacking a fiducial extinction curve for the gemini south site , it was decided to adopt k@xmath28 and k@xmath29 mag airmass@xmath3 , which are the means of the entries in table 3 of smith et al .",
    "the extinction values for may 10 - 17 1998 and march 28 - 31 1999 , which were periods of abnormally high extinction at the usno flagstaff station site , were not used when computing the mean coefficients . adopting the standard deviations in the nightly smith et al .",
    "extinction coefficients as the uncertainties in the values used here , then the error in k@xmath30 and k@xmath31 is @xmath32 mag airmass@xmath3 .",
    "these introduce uncertainties of @xmath33 mag in @xmath0 and @xmath1 brightnesses .",
    "a second order extinction term was not employed as the coefficients are small ( smith et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the zeropoints obtained from the standard star measurements have an internal uncertainty of @xmath34 mag filter@xmath3 .",
    "however , the uncertainty in the absolute calibration of the ngc 5102 observations is larger than this given that the standards were not observed on the same night as ngc 5102 . to be conservative ,",
    "an uncertainty in the absolute calibration of @xmath35 magnitude is adopted , which is the upper limit of that suggested on the gmos web pages ( http://www.gemini.edu/sciops/instruments/gmos/calibration ) .",
    "the brightnesses of objects in the final gmos images were measured with the point spread function ( psf)-fitting routine allstar ( stetson & harris 1988 ) . the star lists , preliminary magnitudes , and psfs that were used in allstar were obtained by running routines in daophot ( stetson 1987 ) .",
    "artificial star experiments were used to assess completeness and estimate the uncertainties in the photometric measurements .",
    "the artificial stars were assigned colors and brightnesses that are appropriate for the locus of red stars in ngc 5102 . as with the real data ,",
    "an artificial star was considered to be recovered only if it was detected in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the difference between the actual and measured brightness was not applied as a criterion for recovery , so that the effects of blending on stellar brightness could be investigated .",
    "the completeness fraction varies across the field because the stellar density in ngc 5102 increases with decreasing r@xmath36 . at projected radii in the disk plane of 3.5 kpc ,",
    "the 50% completeness limit is @xmath37 for a typical giant , while at 5.5 kpc the 50% completeness limit is almost a magnitude fainter .",
    "there is also a systematic radial trend in the difference between the actual and measured @xmath1 brightness of artificial stars , @xmath38 , that is another consequence of crowding .",
    "as might be anticipated from the 50% completeness limits , this is not significant near @xmath39 , which is the approximate brightness of the rgb - tip for metal - poor stars in ngc 5102 , when r@xmath40 kpc .",
    "however , @xmath38 becomes larger at progressively fainter magnitudes . at @xmath41 , which is the approximate brightness of the rgb - tip for the most metal - rich stars in ngc 5102 , @xmath42 magnitudes when r@xmath43 kpc , although @xmath38 drops to 0.1 magnitudes for stars with @xmath41 when r@xmath44 kpc .",
    "it should be noted that colors tend not to be as affected as single filter brightness measurements , as interloping objects that are bright enough to affect photometry in one bandpass tend to also be significant nuisances at neighboring wavelengths . in summary , the artificial star experiments indicate that caution should be exercised when assessing the properties of metal - rich rgb stars in the inner few kpc of ngc 5102 .",
    "the sources detected in the gmos images were sorted into 1 kpc wide annuli .",
    "the placement of objects in these annuli assumes a distance modulus of 27.5 (  5.1 ) and a disk inclination of 64.4 degrees to the line of sight , based on the ratio of major and minor axes in the 2mass large galaxy atlas ( jarrett et al .",
    "the cmds of the various annuli are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the areas sampled in these annuli are listed in table 1 .",
    "the faint limit of the cmds in figure 2 varies with r@xmath36 , as expected due to the increase in stellar density towards smaller r@xmath36 .",
    "a plume of red stars , which is made up of rgb stars in ngc 5102 , can be traced out to r@xmath45 kpc . while stars that belong to ngc 5102 are almost certainly present when r@xmath46 kpc , their number density is such that they do not stand out against the population of foreground stars and background galaxies .",
    "background galaxies dominate over foreground stars near the brightness of the rgb - tip in ngc 5102 . the robin et al .",
    "( 2003 ) model galaxy predicts that there are @xmath47 foreground stars with @xmath1 between 23 and 24 in the area imaged by gmos , with @xmath48 stars in the 10  11 kpc interval . for comparison",
    ", galaxy counts compiled in figure 2 of smail et al .",
    "( 1995 ) suggest that there are @xmath49 background galaxies with @xmath1 between 23 and 24 in the gmos field , with @xmath50 galaxies in the 10  11 kpc annulus .",
    "there are 24 objects with @xmath1 between 23 and 24 in the @xmath51 kpc cmd in figure 2 , and so there is excellent agreement between the predicted and observed number of contaminating objects .",
    "the evolutionary status of stars in ngc 5102 is examined in figure 3 , where the cmds of objects in three annuli are compared with isochrones .",
    "the cmds for the @xmath52 kpc and @xmath53 kpc intervals demonstrate the typical data quality in the ngc 5102 disk , whereas the majority of sources in the 10  11 kpc interval are background galaxies and foreground stars .",
    "the errorbars show the random uncertainties predicted from the artificial star experiments for a star with @xmath39 and @xmath54 .",
    "the error ellipse shrinks as r@xmath36 increases , due to the diminishing impact of crowding on photometric measurements as regions with progressively lower stellar density are sampled .",

    "( 2004 ) transform a grid of isochrones into the sdss photometric system , and some of these are compared with the ngc 5102 observations in figure 3 .",
    "the isochrones shown in figure 3 have z = 0.0001 , 0.001 , 0.004 , and 0.008 ; those in the top row have an age of 10 gyr , while those in the lower row have an age of 1 gyr .",

    "1998 ) , have been assumed .",
    "stars with distinct ages and evolutionary states can be identified in the cmds .",
    "there is a significant population of sources with @xmath59 in the @xmath60 kpc cmd , whereas this region of the 10  11 kpc cmd is almost devoid of objects .",
    "the blue objects in the @xmath60 kpc cmd are bright main sequence stars , the properties of which are discussed in  4 .    it can be seen in the top panel of figure 3 that the majority of objects in the ngc 5102 cmds have colors and brightnesses that are consistent with them evolving on the rgb , and these stars are discussed further in  5 .",
    "there are also stars above the rgb - tip in figure 3 that are evolving on the agb .",
    "the agb stars that are immediately above the rgb - tip have brightnesses and colors that are consistent with them belonging to an old population ; however , there are also agb stars that have brightnesses indicating that they belong to an intermediate age population , and it can be seen from the lower panel of figure 3 that the peak brightness of the agb stars is consistent with an age @xmath61 gyr . the properties of the agb stars are discussed in  6 .",
    "the hii regions in ngc 5102 mark the sites of the most recent star formation in the galaxy .",
    "although hii regions have yet to be detected in the field observed with gmos , there are blue objects with @xmath59 in the cmds of the 2  3 and 3  4 kpc intervals in figure 2 .",
    "these objects are almost certainly young main sequence stars in ngc 5102 rather than foreground stars or background galaxies , as objects with similar colors and brightnesses are absent in the cmds that sample r@xmath62 10kpc .    the blue stellar sequence in figure 2 peaks near @xmath63 , which corresponds to m@xmath64 .",
    "this is consistent with the peak brightness of main sequence stars in the galaxy and the lmc ( e.g. humphreys & mcelroy 1984 ) . as stars at the uppermost limits of the main sequence ,",
    "the blue stars in the western portion of the ngc 5102 disk likely have ages @xmath65 myr .",
    "thus , star formation has occured recently throughout much of the western half of the ngc 5102 disk , albeit at a very modest rate ( see below ) .",
    "clues to the mechanisms that drive star formation in the disk of ngc 5102 can be found by examining the spatial distribution of young objects .",
    "the spatial distribution of main sequence stars in ngc 5102 is investigated in figure 4 , where the positions of sources with @xmath66 and @xmath59 are shown .",
    "the stellar positions are in the plane of the ngc 5102 disk  i.e. they have been de - projected to account for the inclination of the ngc 5102 disk . while there appears to be a slight tendency for the main sequence stars to cluster , they are distributed throughout the western portion of the ngc 5102 disk , with no sign of spiral structure .",
    "this is not unexpected given the absence of spiral structure in the ngc 5102 hi distribution ( van woerden et al .",
    "thus , it appears that star formation in the disk of ngc 5102 at the present epoch is not spurred by spiral density waves .",
    "much of the hi in ngc 5102 is in a ring that has its greatest concentration between 2 and 4 arcmin from the galaxy center ( e.g. figure 6 of van woerden et al .",
    "the dashed lines in figure 4 show the annulus that marks the hi ring in this portion of ngc 5102 .",
    "many of the bright main sequence stars in the western portion of ngc 5102 fall outside of the hi ring , suggesting that the large scale hi distribution in ngc 5102 is not an effective tracer of recent star formation .",
    "the density of main sequence stars in the disk of ngc 5102 is considerably lower than in nearby ` normal ' late - type spirals , and this can be quantified by investigating the specific frequency of blue stars .",
    "following the convention developed to probe globular clusters systems ( e.g. harris & van den bergh 1981 ) , the specific frequency of young stars is taken to be the number of blue objects per unit integrated brightness .",
    "for the current study , the specific frequency of main sequence stars , s@xmath67 , is defined to be the number of stars with @xmath59 and @xmath0 between 22 and 24 normalized to a system with an integrated brightness m@xmath68 .",
    "therefore , s@xmath69 , where n@xmath67 is the number of stars with @xmath59 and @xmath0 between 22 and 24 , while m@xmath70 is the integrated brightness in the region of ngc 5102 being studied .",
    "there are 44 stars with r@xmath36 between 2 and 5 kpc in the gmos field that have photometric properties that suggest they are main sequence stars . using the total @xmath71band brightness in this radial interval measured from the 2mass image of ngc 5102 ( jarrett et al .",
    "2003 ) , then s@xmath72 . for comparison , the star counts given by davidge ( 2007b ) , coupled with the @xmath71band surface photometry from jarrett et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , indicate that s@xmath73 in the disk of ngc 2403 .",
    "therefore , when normalized to the same integrated @xmath71band brightness the number density of main sequence stars in ngc 5102 is only @xmath74 that in ngc 2403 .",
    "the recent sfr in ngc 5102 can be estimated using ngc 2403 as a benchmark .",
    "the total sfr in a spiral galaxy can be computed using diagnostics such as the strength of h@xmath9 emission , which probes star formation in regions of low obscuration , and infrared flux , which probes star formation in heavily obscured areas ( e.g. prez - gonzlez et al .",
    "2006 ) . using the h@xmath9 and fir fluxes of ngc 2403 given in table 4 of bell & kennicutt ( 2001 ) and the sfr calibrations given by kennicutt ( 1998 )",
    ", then the unobscured sfr in ngc 2403 is @xmath75 m@xmath2 year@xmath3 , while the obscured sfr is 0.3 m@xmath2 year@xmath3 . given that ( 1 ) the total m@xmath70 magnitude of ngc 5102 is @xmath76 magnitudes fainter than ngc 2403 ( jarrett et al .",
    "2003 ) , and ( 2 ) the density of young stars in ngc 5102 is 7% that in ngc 2403 , then the present day unobscured sfr in ngc 5102 is @xmath77 m@xmath2 year@xmath3 . as for the obscured sfr in ngc 5102 , the total far infrared flux in ngc 5102 is @xmath78 that in ngc 2403 ( rice et al .",
    "1988 ) , and so the obscured sfr in ngc 5102 is @xmath79 m@xmath2 year@xmath80 .",
    "therefore , the total sfr in ngc 5201 is @xmath81 m@xmath2 year@xmath3 .",
    "red supergiants ( rsgs ) populate a near - vertical finger of stars in the @xmath82 kpc cmd in figure 2 .",
    "the rsg sequence runs from @xmath83 to @xmath84 , with @xmath85 .",
    "a similar feature is seen in the @xmath86 cmds of disk stars in ngc 2403 ( davidge 2007b ) and ngc 247 ( davidge 2006 ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that despite the low number density of young stars throughout the disk of ngc 5102 , the rsg sequence in the @xmath82 kpc cmd is a statistically real feature .",
    "indeed , whereas there are 13 sources with @xmath1 between 22.5 and 21.4 and @xmath87 between 0.2 and 0.5 in the 2  3 kpc cmd , the number of similar objects in the 10  11 kpc interval indicates that only @xmath88 of the candidate rsgs in the @xmath82 kpc cmd is probably a foreground star or background galaxy .",
    "the color and shape of the rsg locus on visible wavelength cmds is sensitive to metallicity , and so it is possible to estimate the metallicity of rsgs in ngc 5102 .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure 5 , where models with z = 0.008 and z = 0.019 from girardi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) are compared with the 2  3 kpc cmd .",
    "the rsg locus is much better matched by the z = 0.008 models than the z = 0.019 models .",
    "the metallicity of rsgs provides constraints on the metallicities of older stars in the disk of ngc 5102 .",
    "given that the youngest stars in a galaxy will probably form from interstellar material that has been subject to cumulative enrichment from past generations of stars , then rgb stars with metallicities that are higher than those of the rsgs should be rare in the disk of ngc 5102 .",
    "it can then be anticipated that the metallicity distribution of rgb stars in ngc 5102 will truncate near [ m / h ] @xmath89 , and this is seen to be the case (  5.2 ) .",
    "the spatial distribution of rsgs in the western disk of ngc 5102 is examined in the right hand panel of figure 4 .",
    "the objects identified as rsgs in this figure have the same photometric properties as marked in figure 5 .",
    "it is evident that  as was found for main sequence stars ",
    "there are a number of rsgs that fall outside the hi ring boundaries .",
    "the distance to ngc 5102 can be measured from the brightness of the rgb - tip .",
    "a complication is that the rgb sequence in the disk of ngc 5102 is broad , and the isochrones in the top row of figure 3 indicate that the rgb stars in this part of ngc 5102 span metallicities from z = 0.0001 to at least z = 0.008 .",
    "such a broad metallicity spread complicates efforts to measure the brightness of the rgb - tip at visible and red wavelengths , since the upper rgb bends over when [ fe / h ] @xmath90 ( e.g. da costa & armandroff 1990 ; ortolani , barbuy , & bica 1991 ) , which in turn blurs the signature rgb - tip discontinuity in the luminosity function ( lf ) .",
    "age is another parameter that can broaden the rgb and affect the ability to detect the rgb - tip . at a given metallicity ,",
    "younger stars have bluer colors than older stars , and the 1 gyr agb sequences in the bottom row of figure 3 pass through a part of the cmd that is also occupied by metal - poor rgb stars .",
    "the presence of these intermediate age agb stars will dilute the rgb - tip discontinuity .",
    "the impact of a broad metallicity dispersion can be reduced by restricting the rgb sample to stars with colors that are appropriate for z @xmath91 . for the current study only stars with @xmath87 between 0.3 and 0.6 are used to determine the rgb - tip brightness . while the isochrones shown in the lower panel of figure 3 indicate that intermediate age stars may be present in this color interval , the removal of these objects with the available data is problematic . in any event , while agb stars with this age may reduce the amplitude of the rgb - tip discontinuity , they are not expected to skew the brightness estimated for the rgb - tip .",
    "the sample was further culled so that only stars with r@xmath92 kpc are considered .",
    "this was done to reduce the impact of photometric errors on the rgb - tip measurement .",
    "the linear and logarithmic lfs of stars with r@xmath36 between 4 and 7 kpc and having @xmath87 between 0.3 and 0.6 are shown in the upper two panels of figure 6 .",
    "the result of convolving the linear lf with a three point sobel edge - detection kernel is shown in the bottom panel .",

    "the metal - rich end over a large range of r@xmath36 suggests that incompleteness is likely not a major issue in defining the mdfs .",
    "crowding is another source of concern when considering the mdfs .",
    "if two stars of the same brightness fall in the same angular resolution element then they will appear as a single object that is 0.75 mag brighter than the progenitors .",
    "this will have the greatest impact among metal - rich rgb stars , where the rgb - tip is fainter in @xmath1 than for metal - poor stars .",
    "the incidence of blending can be estimated empirically by considering the number density of objects with @xmath1 between 25.5 and 26.0 , which is the magnitude range where pairs of stars will blend to form objects with brightnesses that are comparable to those of metal - rich rgb - tip stars . accounting for incompleteness , there are 3240 stars with @xmath1 between 25.5 and 26.0 in the 4  6 kpc interval , and 630 such stars in the 6  8 kpc interval . assuming that each resolution element has a radius that is one half of the fwhm , then there will be @xmath115 two - star blends in the 4  6 kpc interval and only 6 such blends in the 6  8 kpc interval .",
    "the number of blends predicted in the previous paragraph are conservative upper limits .",
    "first , stars that are separated by half of the seeing disk radius will form a composite object that is noticeably elongated , and hence will be rejected by daophot .",
    "this is an important consideration , as the predicted number of blends is critically sensitive to the size of the resolution element .",
    "for example , if the resolution element is assumed to have a radius that is one quarter that of the seeing disk , then the number of blends expected in the 4 - 6 kpc interval plummets to 10 .",
    "second , the number counts used to estimate the blending rate span the entire range of colors , and so not all blends will have colors that are consistent with those of metal - rich stars .",
    "the issue of blending at the metal - rich end of the mdf of stars in the 4  6 kpc interval notwithstanding , the overall appearance of the mdfs in figure 8 suggests that the peak [ m / h ] may shift to more metal - poor values as r@xmath36 increases .",
    "such a trend is not unexpected given the evidence for radial metallicity gradients in the disks of many nearby spiral galaxies based on the measurements of line strengths in hii regions .",
    "still , a kolomogorov - smirnov test indicates that the 6  8 and 4  6 kpc mdfs differ at well below the 90% confidence level ",
    "i.e. they are not significantly different . however , the 8 - 10 and 4 - 6 kpc mdfs differ at roughly the 95% confidence level .",
    "thus , there is tentative evidence for a metallicity gradient in the rgb content in the ngc 5102 disk .",
    "larger area surveys of the outer regions of ngc 5102 will be required to obtain the stellar sample sizes that will allow for a more rigourous test for a metallicity gradient .",
    "the mdfs in figure 8 are contaminated by agb stars that belong to an intermediate age population (  6 ) .",
    "it can be seen from figure 7 that agb stars with an age of 1 gyr and m@xmath116 will masquerade as rgb stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath117 , and so interloping agb stars will skew the true mdf of old rgb stars to lower values .",
    "it is thus worth noting that the majority of stars in the mdfs have [ fe / h ] @xmath118 , indicating that intermediate age agb stars likely do not have a large impact on the observed mdfs .",
    "comparisons with isochrones suggest that ( 1 ) the brightest of the agb stars in the western disk of ngc 5102 have an age @xmath61 gyr , and ( 2 ) the agb stars are moderately metal - rich , with the majority falling to the right of the z = 0.004 isochrones in the lower panel of figure 7 .",
    "this second result is not unexpected given that the rgb mdfs peak near z = 0.004 (  5.2 ) ; the brightest agb stars are younger than the rgb stars , and so likely formed from more metal - enriched gas than the majority of rgb stars .",

    "thus , the number of stars with [ m / h ] @xmath169 is not greatly different from that expected if ( 1 ) 20% of the disk mass comes from intermediate age stars , and ( 2 ) the number of rgb stars in the disk of ngc 5102 with [ m / h ] @xmath169 is modest . in summary , accounting for intermediate age stars will truncate the rgb mdf near [ m / h ] @xmath170 , rather than at [ m / h ] @xmath171 . the peak in the mdf of the 4  6 kpc interval at [ m / h ] @xmath172 is not affected by intermediate age stars ; the conclusion that the majority of disk giants in ngc 5102 are moderately metal - rich is thus robust .",
    "we close the discussion of the old stellar content of ngc 5102 by noting that the old disk of this galaxy is spatially extended when compared with late - type spirals . in  3 it is shown that rgb stars can be traced out to r@xmath173 kpc along the disk plane in ngc 5102 .",
    "this is a lower limit to the actual extent of the stellar disk , as it indicates only the point at which the number of rgb stars can be detected in the presence of contamination from background galaxies and foreground stars . with a distance - corrected exponential scale length of 0.7 kpc ( freeman 1970 ) ,",
    "then the disk of ngc 5102 is traced out to @xmath5 scale lengths .",
    "this exceeds what is measured in many late - type spirals , such as ngc 247 ( davidge 2006 ) , ngc 2403 ( davidge 2007b ) , and even ngc 300 ( bland - hawthorn et al . 2005 ) .",
    "there are hints that ngc 5102 may have been a late - type disk galaxy earlier in its life .",
    "the low specific frequency of globular clusters is consistent with that of a late - type spiral galaxy , rather than of an early - type system ( kraft et al .",
    "2005 ) , while the mdf of rgb stars in the disks of ngc 5102 and the lmc are similar .",
    "in addition , while there are no signs of spiral structure in the distributions of young stars or hi , the radial distribution of hi in ngc 5102 more closely follows that in spirals than classical s0s , albeit with a lower mass density ( van woerden et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "a sfr like that which occured in ngc 5102 during intermediate epochs may have been high enough to have a significant impact on the observational properties of a normal late - type disk galaxy .",
    "heckman ( 2002 ) finds that outflows occur when the density of star formation exceeds @xmath100 solar masses year@xmath3 kpc@xmath174 . with an effective radius of 75.6 arcsec ( jarrett et al .",
    "2003 ) , which corresponds to a linear distance of 1.2 kpc , then a sfr of @xmath88 m@xmath2 year@xmath3 is required to fuel an outflow in ngc 5102 .",
    "this falls below the lower limit to the sfr during intermediate epochs computed in  7.1 ( 1.4 m@xmath2 year@xmath3 ) , and raises the possibility that ngc 5102 may have lost much of its gas and dust in the not too distant past .",
    "the result would be a disk - dominated galaxy with a depleted ism and a low sfr at the present day .",
    "the events that lead to elevated sfrs in the nucleus and bulge of ngc 5102 during the past @xmath88 gyr are a matter of speculation .",
    "there are no morphological features that support a merger - driven origin for the elevated sfrs , and ngc 5102 is in an isolated environment ( van woerden et al .",
    "1993 ) . still , the distance estimates listed in table 2 of karachentsev et al .",
    "( 2007 ) place the barred spiral galaxy eso383g087 , which appears to be the closest known neighbor , at a distance of @xmath175 mpc , while cen a is at a distance of @xmath176 mpc . while ngc 5102 is currently isolated",
    ", a triggering encounter may still have occured @xmath88 gyr in the past .",
    "indeed , the distance between ngc 5102 and eso383-g087 could be traversed within 1 gyr if the velocity difference between these galaxies were 300  400 km sec@xmath3",
    ".    there may be galaxies in other nearby groups that are related to ngc 5102 in an evolutionary context .",
    "the high sfr estimated for ngc 5102 during intermediate epochs is reminiscent of what is seen in m82 .",
    "the sfr of m82 based on the fir flux is @xmath177 m@xmath2 year@xmath3 , and oconnell & mangano ( 1978 ) suggest that m82 was likely an sc / irr galaxy prior to interacting with m81 . using a variety of observational constraints , including chemical abundances and the depth of balmer absorption lines , mayya et al .",
    "( 2006 ) conclude that a large fraction of the m82 disk formed over a period of only a few hundred myr , terminating @xmath178 gyr in the past . the star formation is powering a mass outflow in m82 ( e.g. heckman , armus , and miley 1990 ) , and if the outflow disrupts enough of the ism of m82 then its appearance a few hundred myr in the future may be similar to that of ngc 5102 today .",
