    "it is well known @xcite,@xcite that in some mass regions several bands of negative parity are observed in the low - lying nuclear spectra in even - even nuclei , like @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands .",
    "the most well - studied of them is the @xmath1 band , usually interpreted as an octupole vibrational band , connected to the ground state band ( gsb ) by enhanced @xmath4 transitions .",
    "negative parity states have been described within different approaches mainly by inclusion of octupole or / and dipole degrees of freedom .",
    "the bands of negative parity states are often associated with the reflection asymmetry in the intrinsic frame of reference . in the geometrical approach",
    "this is achieved by including of the @xmath5 deformation @xcite . in the interacting boson model ( ibm )",
    "@xcite the description of negative states requires the introduction of @xmath6 or / and @xmath7 bosons with negative parity in addition to the standard @xmath8 and @xmath9 bosons ( @xmath10-ibm ) @xcite,@xcite .",
    "an alternative interpretation of the low - lying negative parity states has been provided in different cluster models @xcite-@xcite in which the dipole degrees of freedom are related with the relative motion of the clusters . based on the bohr hamiltonian different critical point",
    "symmetries ( cps ) including axial quadrupole and octupole deformations have been proposed @xcite-@xcite , @xcite extending the concept of cps introduced for the description of positive parity states .    in this paper",
    "we present an algebraic approach , complementary to the spdf - ibm @xcite , for the unified description of the low - lying positive and negative parity bands in some even - even nuclei from the rare earth and actinide mass regions within the framework of the symplectic interacting vector boson model ( ivbm ) with sp(12,@xmath0 ) dynamical symmetry group @xcite .",
    "the present work is an extension of the approach proposed in ref.@xcite for the description of the ground state band and the `` octupole '' ( @xmath1 ) band , often treated as a single ground state alternating parity band . in this way",
    "we investigate simultaneously the first few low - lying negative parity bands ( @xmath11 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) together with the first few positive parity ( ground state , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) bands .",
    "it is shown that the negative parity bands arise along with the positive bands without the introduction of any additional collective degrees of freedom .",
    "additionally , we calculate the strengths of the intraband @xmath14 transitions in both the gsb and @xmath11 band , as well as the interband @xmath4 transitions connecting the states of these two bands .",
    "the energy staggering of the ground state alternating band which is a sensitive indicator of the octupole correlations in the even - even nuclei is also calculated and compared with experiment .",
    "it was suggested by bargmann and moshinsky @xcite,@xcite that two types of bosons are needed for the description of nuclear dynamics .",
    "it was shown there that the consideration of only two - body system consisting of two different interacting vector particles will suffice to give a complete description of @xmath15 three - dimensional oscillators with a quadrupole - quadrupole interaction .",
    "the latter can be considered as the underlying basis in the algebraic construction of the _ phenomenological _ ivbm @xcite .",
    "the algebraic structure of the ivbm is realized in terms of creation and annihilation operators of two kinds of vector bosons @xmath16 , @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) , which differ in an additional quantum number @xmath19 ( or @xmath20 and @xmath21)@xmath22the projection of the @xmath23spin ( an analogue to the @xmath24spin of ibm-2 or the @xmath25spin of the particle - hole ibm ) .",

    "its irreducible representations are infinite dimensional .",
    "we also introduce the following notations for the two bosons : @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
