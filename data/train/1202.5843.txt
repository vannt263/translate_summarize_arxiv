    "foams are used widely , for example in industries associated with mining , oil recovery and personal care products @xcite .",
    "their use is often preferred because of properties such as a high surface area , low density and a yield stress @xcite .",
    "in addition to this evidence of plasticity , a foam s rheology is dominated by elasticity at low strains and viscous flow at high strain - rates : they are elasto - visco - plastic fluids @xcite .",
    "a common probe of foam rheology is a variation of stokes experiment @xcite in which an object moves relative to a foam @xcite .",
    "foams have an advantage over many complex fluids in that their local structure ( the bubbles ) is observable , thus making them an excellent choice to determine the mechanisms by which non - newtonian fluids show different responses to newtonian fluids .",
    "in addition , a two - dimensional foam is a realizable entity , for example the bragg bubble raft @xcite , with which it is possible to perform a rheological experiment in which the shape and velocity of each bubble can be tracked in time .",
    "foams are also amenable to numerical simulation because of the precise local geometry that is found wherever soap films meet .",
    "plateau s laws , which describe how the films meet , are a consequence of each soap film minimizing its energy , equivalent to surface area , and it is this that provides the algorithm for the work described here .    for flow to occur in a foam , the bubbles must slide past each other .",
    "this occurs through t1 neighbour switching topological changes @xcite , in which small faces and/or short films disappear and new ones appear .",
    "sometimes referred to as plastic events , these are a visible indication of plasticity in a foam , and act to reduce the stress and energy .",
    "numerous contributions to viscous dissipation occur @xcite , although we assume that if the flow is slow enough they can all be neglected .",
    "@xcite measured the drag , lift and torque on an ellipse in a two - dimensional foam flow in a channel .",
    "the lift was maximized when the ellipse was oriented at an angle of @xmath0 to the direction of flow .",
    "@xcite found that an aerofoil embedded in a foam flow exhibited a _ negative _ lift , which they attributed to the elasticity of the foam .",
    "this augments the list of well - known non - newtonian effects that contradict the sense of what is known for newtonian fluids .",
    "we present here elasto - plastic simulations , in the so - called quasi - static limit , for 2d foam flow around an obstacle , and investigate the effect of the symmetry of the obstacle in determining the magnitude and direction of the drag and lift .",
    "such simulations allow us to exclude consideration of viscous effects , and even to separate out pressure and film network contributions to the forces on an obstacle , both of which are difficult to do in experiment . as a means of determining drag and lift on an obstacle",
    ", they have been validated against experiments on an ellipse @xcite by @xcite .",
    "we consider a range of obstacle shapes , illustrated in figure [ fig : obstacles ] .",
    "since the evolver uses a gradient descent method , we are unable to simulate an obstacle with sharp corners .",
    "we therefore round the corners of each obstacle with segments of a circle to smooth the boundary .",
    "the shapes are :    a.   a circle , which provides the standard case with full symmetry .",
    "its cross - section is @xmath1 .",
    "b.   the union of a square and two semi - circles , which we call a `` stadium '' , arranged either vertically or horizontally .",
    "the side - length @xmath2 of the square is equal to the diameter of each semi - circle , so that the area is determined by just one parameter , @xmath3 .",
    "the cross - section is @xmath2 ( horizontal stadium ) or @xmath4 ( vertical stadium ) . c.   a square , with rounded corners .",
    "the radius of curvature of the corners is set to one - eighth of the side - length of the square , @xmath5 , so that the area is again determined by just one parameter , and @xmath6 .",
    "also a diamond , which is the square rotated by @xmath0 , with @xmath7 .",
    "d.   a symmetric aerofoil , with long axis parallel to the direction of foam flow , defined by two arcs of circles bounded by two tangential straight lines .",
    "three parameters are needed : length @xmath8 ( distance between the centres of the circles ) , and radii @xmath9 ( leading edge ) and @xmath10 ( trailing edge ) .",
    "this shape has up - down symmetry but not fore - aft symmetry , and cross - section @xmath11 . if @xmath12 , then this is a `` long '' horizontal stadium .",
    "e.   an aerofoil - like shape with up - down asymmetry , in which two circles of equal radius @xmath10 are joined by arcs of radius @xmath9 and @xmath13 .",
    "the distance between the circles is parametrized by the angle @xmath14 .",
    "its cross - section is @xmath15 .",
    "this approximation to a standard aerofoil dispenses with the singular point at the trailing edge .",
    "we begin by describing our numerical method (  [ sec : method ] ) .",
    "the forces on each obstacle are given in ",
    "[ sec : resultsfo ] ; we find that the drag is mainly determined by its maximum cross - section @xmath16 perpendicular to the direction of flow and that a significant lift is found only for the aerofoil without up - down symmetry .",
    "the field of bubble pressure around the obstacle , which is the main contribution to this lift , is described in  [ sec : resultsfi ] , and we make some concluding remarks in  [ sec : concs ] .",
    "we use the surface evolver @xcite in the manner described by @xcite .",
    "we create three foams of around 725 bubbles ( in this range the number of bubbles does not affect the results ; data not shown ) between parallel walls with a voronoi construction @xcite .",
    "the channel has unit length and width @xmath17 .",
    "the foams are monodisperse , with bubble area denoted @xmath18 and about 22 bubbles in the cross - section of the channel . a bubble in the centre of the channel is chosen to represent the obstacle , and its periphery constrained to the required shape ; its area is then increased until it reaches the desired area ratio @xmath19 and it is then fixed ",
    "see figure [ fig : foam](a ) .",
    "the tension of each film , @xmath20 , which is twice the air - liquid surface tension and is in effect a line tension , is taken equal to one , without loss of generality .",
    "the boundary conditions are that of free slip on the boundary of the obstacle and the channel walls , so that the films meet the boundaries at @xmath21 , and periodicity in the direction of flow .",
    "we checked in a few instances that changing the boundary condition on the channel walls to non - slip has little effect on the forces on a small obstacle in the centre of the channel . at each iteration the foam is pushed with a small area increment @xmath22 to create a pressure gradient @xcite .",
    "the perimeter is then evolved towards a local minimum and t1s are performed whenever a film length shrinks below @xmath23 ( representing a foam with low liquid fraction , of the order of @xmath24 ) .",
    "a simulation runs for 1500 iterations to ensure that the measurements are made beyond any transient in which the foam retains a memory of its initial state .",
    "each simulation takes about one week on a 1.5ghz cpu .",
    "the method has been validated against experiment in the case of an elliptical obstacle @xcite .",
    "each film that touches the obstacle applies an outward force with magnitude equal to the force of surface tension and direction perpendicular to the obstacle boundary .",
    "their resultant is the network force @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the unit outward normal at the vertex @xmath27 terminating each film that meets the obstacle .",
    "see figure [ fig : foam](a ) .",
    "each bubble that touches the obstacle applies a pressure force inward at the middle of the shared boundary .",
    "their resultant is the pressure force @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the pressure of bubble @xmath30 , @xmath31 the length of shared boundary and @xmath32 the unit outward normal to the obstacle at the midpoint of the line joining the two ends of the shared boundary .",
    "the drag on an obstacle is the component of the sum of the network and pressure forces in the direction of motion , @xmath33 .",
    "the lift is the component perpendicular to this , @xmath34 , with the convention that positive values of lift act in the positive @xmath35 direction .",
    "all four components are recorded at the end of each iteration , and averaged above 600 iterations , well beyond any transient .",
    "an example is shown in figure [ fig : foam](b ) .",
    "the standard deviation of the fluctuations in force about this average are used to give the error bars in the figures below .",
    "the drag and lift oscillate in a saw - tooth fashion ( figure [ fig : foam](b ) ) , caused by intervals in which the imposed strain is stored elastically followed by cascades of t1 topological changes .",
    "nonetheless , they have a well - defined average .",
    "we find that for all obstacles with up - down symmetry the average lift is close to zero .",
    "we vary the area ratio of each obstacle , usually in the range one to ten but occasionally higher .",
    "we normalize the cross - section and length of each obstacle by the average bubble diameter @xmath36 which , since the walls are far enough away not to have an effect on the drag and lift , is the significant length - scale here .",
    "we choose to plot the resulting drag as a function of cross - section @xmath37 ( figure [ fig : drag ] ) since it gives an approximately linear relationship @xcite .",
    "it is apparent that the drag increases with obstacle cross - section most quickly for `` blunt '' objects with a vertical leading edge ( square , vertical stadium ) .",
    "obstacles with a rounded leading edge ( circle @xcite , horizontal stadium ) experience lower drag for given cross - section . in each case , the main contribution to the drag is usually due to network forces ; the pressure contribution to the total drag is lower but follows the same trends .    to tease out the effect of obstacle shape on the two components of drag studied here",
    ", we fix the cross - section ( figure [ fig : drag - length](a),(b ) ) and vary the shape . the pressure contribution to the drag",
    "is highest when the leading edge is blunt ( vertical stadium , square ) , since this causes the greatest deformation to the bubbles .",
    "similarly , the network contribution to the drag is highest when the trailing edge is rounded ( the most `` circular '' case in figure [ fig : drag - length](b ) ) , although this effect is weaker , since a rounded trailing edge allows more films to collect in that area .",
    "the shape of the diamond is such that the network drag is very low , since films can gather on the sloping sides as well as the rounded region at the very tip of the trailing edge , while the pressure drag is intermediate .",
    "the length @xmath8 of an obstacle has only a weak effect on the drag ( figure [ fig : drag - length](c ) ) .",
    "in particular , this is the case for a symmetric aerofoil with @xmath38 , since most of the films that touch the obstacle are perpendicular to the direction of foam flow . by varying the ratio @xmath39 for a symmetric aerofoil with fixed cross - section @xmath16 and fixed area ratio @xmath40",
    ", we can investigate the effect of fore - aft asymmetry .",
    "figure [ fig : drag - length](d ) shows that the total drag varies little , emphasizing that cross - section and rounded leading and trailing edges make the major contribution to the drag . the pressure contribution to the drag decreases with @xmath39 ,",
    "that is , as the leading edge gets smaller and bubbles are less deformed there .    .",
    "all three of @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath14 are chosen to increase roughly in the same proportion .",
    "the lift is always in the negative @xmath35 direction and the network contribution is smaller than that due to pressure.,width=302 ]    the lift is , on average , zero for all obstacles with a horizontal axis of symmetry ( as in figure [ fig : foam](b ) ) ; it is only significant for the asymmetric aerofoil , being negative and of the same order of magnitude as the drag .",
    "in particular the lift increases with aerofoil length ( figure [ fig : liftaerofoil ] ) , and the major component of lift arises from the bubble pressures .",
    "it appears therefore that the curvature of the aerofoil induces changes in bubble pressures , and that it is this , rather than an imbalance in the number of films pulling on the top and bottom surfaces of the object , that gives rise to the lift .",
    "we return to the bubble pressures below .    to test the effect of obstacle position in the channel",
    ", we placed the same asymmetric aerofoil in three different positions across the channel : @xmath41 ( reference case ) and @xmath42 .",
    "no significant difference in the drag or lift was observed ( data not shown ) , indicating that the obstacle was still sufficiently far from the walls that they do nt interfere with the flow ( recall that this is a elasto - plastic rather than a viscous flow , distinct from a newtonian fluid where the wall always has an effect in 2d ) and that the lift is not just due to the foam squeezing through the gap between wall and obstacle .      to further probe the phenomenon of negative lift in foams , in figure [ fig : fields_p ] we compare the distribution of bubble pressures around the flat - bottomed aerofoil with an up - down symmetric obstacle typified by the square .",
    "the surface evolver calculates the bubble pressures ( as lagrange multipliers of the area constraints ) in such a way that they are all relative to the pressure of one bubble .",
    "thus the average pressure is subtracted from all values at each iteration , before binning the data as above .",
    "the bubble pressures decrease in the @xmath43 direction , on average , because of the flow .",
    "the presence of an obstacle induces a region of high pressure at the leading edge and a region of low pressure at the trailing edge .",
    "in addition , the asymmetric aerofoil shows a region of high pressure above and low pressure below , confirming that the pressure contribution to the lift is downwards .",
    "the simulations described here show that the forces on an obstacle embedded in a flow of foam depend strongly on the shape of the obstacle .",
    "we separate two components , due to the pressure in the bubbles and the network of soap films , and find that the pressure contribution decreases with the rounding of the leading edge and the network contribution decreases with the rounding of the trailing edge .",
    "further evidence is given in figure [ fig : futureshapes](a ) .    in classical fluid mechanics ,",
    "the presence of viscosity can give rise to trailing vortices and circulation around an obstacle in a fluid flow . here ,",
    "not only do we neglect viscosity , but the discrete nature of the foam probably suppresses any possibility of circulation . yet a lift force is still observed for obstacles without lateral symmetry , and it arises because of the way in which the obstacle deforms the bubbles that make up the foam .",
    "it is therefore an effect of elasticity or , more generally , viscoelasticity @xcite , due to the normal stresses generated in the fluid , and acts in the opposite direction to the usual sense of `` lift '' . a concave underside ,",
    "as in the familiar joukowski profile and the asymmetric aerofoil described above , is not necessary to obtain a negative lift ( figure [ fig : futureshapes](b ) ) .    it remains to determine whether a given obstacle is actually stable with respect to rotation ; that is , whether the torque on any given obstacle is sufficient to rotate it and thereby reduce the drag and/or lift .",
    "this is a necessary pre - cursor to using this work to determining which shapes of obstacles offer the least resistance to foam flow .",
    "it is also of interest to incorporate some element of viscous dissipation , perhaps using the viscous froth model @xcite , within the simulations , which has a particularly significant effect on rotation @xcite but also the film motion around an obstacle .",
    "we shall return to both these issues in future work .",
