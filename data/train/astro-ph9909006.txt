    "the study of evolution of globular clusters has a long history",
    ". it would be most desirable to use direct @xmath0-body calculations in order to follow the evolution of realistic globular clusters realistically , but we do not have enough computing power to do that for @xmath0 comparable to the number of stars in real globular clusters at this moment .",
    "therefore we have to rely on approximate techniques to understand the dynamics of star clusters .",
    "the fokker - planck equation has been widely used for the study of globular clusters , but it requires many simplifying assumptions .",
    "the assumption of velocity isotropy is usually employed because it allows fast and accurate integration of the fokker - planck equation ( cohn 1980 ) . however , high degree of velocity anisotropy is known to be generated by two - body relaxation in the outer parts of isolated clusters ( e.g. , spitzer 1987 ) .",
    "the observational properties of the clusters depend on the degree of anisotropy and correct treatment of anisotropy becomes an important issue .",
    "the development of velocity anisotropy was investigated in some recent works which used various numerical methods : e.g. , direct @xmath0-body calculations by giersz & heggie ( 1994 ) , gaseous model calculations by louis & spurzem ( 1991 ) and spurzem ( 1996 ) , and fokker - planck calculations by cohn ( 1979 ) , drukier et al . ( 1999 ) and takahashi ( 1995 , 1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "most of these calculations confirmed the earlier expectations of generation of radial anisotropy in the outer parts of the clusters , although detailed behaviour depends somewhat on the numerical methods .",
    "actual clusters are embedded in the galactic tidal field which should impose a finite boundary to the cluster .",
    "the introduction of tidal boundaries should have significant effects on the velocity anisotropy .",
    "recently takahashi , lee & inagaki ( 1997 ; abbreviated as tli hereafter ) performed anisotropic fokker - planck simulations for single mass clusters and demonstrated that radial anisotropy grows up to the time of core collapse , but the degree of anisotropy begins to decrease to smaller values as the cluster expands and loses significant amount of mass .",
    "they showed that there is even _",
    "anisotropy very close to the tidal boundary in the late phase of the cluster s evolution .",
    "the density profiles of the clusters can be reasonably fitted by isotropic king models for most of the time except for the brief phase around the core collapse , when the degree of radial anisotropy nearly reaches its maximum .",
    "the behaviour of the anisotropy for isolated clusters with mass spectra has some interesting features .",
    "takahashi ( 1997 ) showed that the degree of anisotropy for different mass components behaves differently .",
    "there is always radial anisotropy for low mass components , but tangential anisotropy can develop for high mass components at early evolutionary stages when the temperature of heavy stars decreases rapidly toward the equipartition . during this ` cooling ' phase , the radial velocity dispersion decreases more rapidly than the tangential one .",
    "this leads to the development of tangential anisotropy among high mass stars .    as in the case of single mass models , extension of these studies into tidally limited clusters",
    "should provide useful insight on the evolution of realistic clusters . based on the experience of single mass models",
    ", one obviously expects that the velocity anisotropy will be greatly affected by the presence of the tidal field .",
    "some of the essential points have been clarified by the analyses of @xmath0-body results ( vesperini & heggie 1997 ) , but one should remember that the @xmath0-body calculations are done for small @xmath0 cases . many of the behaviour of self - gravitating systems does not allow simple scaling ( e.g. , portegies zwart et al .",
    "1998 , takahashi & portegies zwart 1998 ) .",
    "we make detailed calculations for the evolution of globular clusters with these effects in order to make quantitative assessments for the long term evolution of star clusters with the tidal cut - off and mass spectrum .",
    "the study of the evolution of tidally limited clusters has important areas of application .",
    "the mass function of globular clusters is difficult to obtain because of large dynamic range in brightness of individual stars as well as large variation of stellar densities .",
    "it is very difficult to determine the _ global _ mass function observationally , but there have been several studies to determine the global mass function based on _ locally _ measured mass functions in limited areas of globular clusters ( richer et al . 1990 , 1991 and references therein ) .",
    "it is absolute necessity to obtain the global mass function if one wants to study factors determining the mass function of clusters .",
    "the conversion of the local mass function to the global one is not a trivial task .",
    "the general practice employed widely is to fit the observation to multi - mass king models ( e.g. , meylan 1988 ) or to assume that the mass function in low mass stars in the outer parts are close to the global one ( richer et al .",
    "1991 ) . however , there is no guarantee that these processes give a right answer .",
    "the detailed studies of evolving clusters with the tidal boundary can provide an important check of the above mentioned practices .",
    "the mass function changes with time because the rate of escape of stars depends on the mass of the star .",
    "the high mass stars tend to spiral into the central parts by dynamical friction , and consequently low mass stars are preferentially removed from the tidally limited clusters .",
    "the slope of mass function thus becomes less steep as the cluster loses mass .",
    "even if one gets the global mass function through careful observations and correct conversion process , the present day mass function ( pdmf ) may be significantly different from the initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "the detailed studies of evolving star clusters could provide an important framework of estimating the relation between pdmf and imf .",
    "in the present paper , we make detailed studies of the the evolution of tidally limited multi - mass clusters including the effects of velocity anisotropy .",
    "we pay special attention to the behaviour of mass function during the course of dynamical evolution .",
    "we examine the adequacy of the process of converting the local mass function to the global mass function using multi - mass king model fitting .",
    "we then analyze how the mass function changes with time and location .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : fpmodels ] , we describe our models for the evolution of globular clusters . in ",
    "[ sec : ch ] , we introduce the idea of half - mass concentration and discuss its relation to the development of anisotropy and to mass loss rates . in  [ sec : mmmodels ] we describe initial conditions of multi - mass models . in  [ sec : results ] we present the results of the model calculations . the relationship between local and global mass function and the temporal evolution of mass function",
    "are examined in  [ sec : mf ] .",
    "we discuss the velocity dispersion profiles in  [ sec : vd ] .",
    "the final section summarizes basic results .",
    "we use the anisotropic fokker - planck code developed by takahashi ( 1995 ) .",
    "it is based on the direct integration method of the fokker - planck equation in @xmath1 space ( cohn 1979 ) , where @xmath2 is the energy of a star per unit mass and @xmath3 is the angular momentum per unit mass .",
    "the extension to multi - mass clusters is described in takahashi ( 1997 ) and the treatment of tidal boundary can be found from tli .",
    "tli used two different criteria for the escape of a star from the cluster : apocenter criterion and energy criterion .",
    "the _ apocenter _ criterion assumes that a star escapes if the apocenter distance of a star with @xmath1 becomes greater than tidal radius @xmath4 .",
    "this criterion preferentially removes the stars with low @xmath5 and thus suppresses the development of radial anisotropy .",
    "the @xmath6 criterion assumes that a star escapes if @xmath7 where @xmath8 .",
    "the radial anisotropy is also suppressed in this criterion and tangential anisotropy can develop ( see tli ) .",
    "the general behaviour of the cluster evolution is not much dependent on the choice of escape criteria for the models of tli , but details of the clusters vary with the treatment of stellar evaporation .",
    "takahashi & portegies zwart ( 1998 ) have shown that the apocenter criterion gives better results when compared with realistic @xmath0-body calculations . in the present study",
    ", we examine the results of our calculations with both of the criteria , but more emphasis is given to the calculations with the apocenter criterion .",
    "hereafter , we denote anisotropic models with the apocenter criterion as _ aa _ models and anisotropic models with the energy criterion as _ ae _ models .",
    "the capital _ a _ stands for anisotropic models , and the lower cases _ a _ and _ e _ stand for apocenter and energy criteria , respectively . similarly isotropic models are denoted as _ ie _ models , but _",
    "ia _ models do not exist .",
    "before going into descriptions of the results of multi - mass models , we examine the effects of the degree of the concentration of a cluster on the development of velocity anisotropy and on the cluster mass loss rate .",
    "we use single - mass models in this section because these models are simple , but the conclusions of this section are also true for multi - mass models , as we show later .",
    "tli used the initial model of a single - mass plummer model with the cutoff radius of 32 in plummer model units .",
    "the results of their simulations show that the _ aa _  and _ ae _  models lose mass faster than the _ ie _  model ( see fig . 2a of tli , though the _ ae _  model is not shown in it ) .",
    "the evaporation time of the _ ie _  model is about 12% longer than that of the _ aa _  model , and the latter is about 10% longer than that of the _ ae _  model .",
    "the biggest difference in the mass loss rate between the anisotropic models and the isotropic model appears in the pre - collapse and the early post - collapse phases .",
    "the mass loss rates of the different models are similar in the late post - collapse phase .",
    "in  [ sec : results ] we show the results of simulations which start with multi - mass king models . as shown in fig .",
    "[ massfig ] , the _ ie _  model and the _ ae_model are very similar in the evolution of the total mass .",
    "the _ aa _",
    "model loses mass _ slower _ than the _ ie _  model .",
    "this trend is opposite to that seen in the simulations of tli . while fig .",
    "[ massfig ] shows the results for a @xmath9 king model , the same trend is seen for king models with other @xmath10 .",
    "why does the opposite trend appear ?",
    "the change from the single - mass model to the multi - mass model is not the reason of the change of the trend .",
    "rather , it is found that the trend changes with the concentration of a cluster to the tidal cutoff radius .",
    "first we discuss what parameter is useful in measuring the degree of the concentration of a cluster . for king models ,",
    "the concentration is usually measured in terms of the concentration parameter @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the king core radius ( king 1966 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath13 is useful in measuring the concentration of the core .",
    "however , when discussing the variation of the total mass , @xmath13 is not always an appropriate parameter , because the fraction of the core mass is very small in large @xmath13 clusters",
    ". it may be more appropriate to use the half - mass radius @xmath14 instead of the core radius @xmath12 .",
    "thus we define half - mass concentration @xmath15 ( note the logarithm is not taken here ) .",
    "king models form a one - parameter family parameterized by the concentration @xmath13 or equivalently by the dimensionless central potential depth @xmath10 ; @xmath13 monotonically increases with @xmath10 ( king 1966 ) . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath16 does vary monotonically with @xmath10 .",
    "the relation among @xmath10 , @xmath13 , and @xmath16 is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : king ] for @xmath17 .",
    "in contrast to that the core concentration @xmath13 varies by nearly three orders of magnitude , the variation of the half - mass concentration @xmath16 is within a factor of three for this range of @xmath10 .",
    "the half - mass concentration @xmath16 increases with @xmath10 for @xmath18 to 8 , then it decreases until @xmath10 reaches and increases again . for the range of @xmath17",
    ", @xmath16 reaches the maximum of about 10 at @xmath19 .",
    "the initial model of tli has @xmath20 , therefore it is far more concentrated than any king models in terms of the half - mass concentration .    in order to investigate the effects of the half - mass concentration on the cluster evolution , we carry out simulations which start with single - mass plummer models with different cutoff radii which correspond to @xmath2110 , 20 , and 30 . in these simulations",
    "the number of particle is set to @xmath22 , which is specified to include the effects of three - body binary heating . fig .",
    "[ fig : plmass ] shows the evolution of the total mass for the _ ae _  and _ ie _  models . for the large @xmath16 initial models , the _ ae",
    "_  model loses mass much faster than the _ ie _  model at the early evolutionary phase as in tli s simulations .",
    "( the core collapse occurs at @xmath231618@xmath24 in all the models . ) as @xmath16 decreases , the difference between the _ ae _  and _ ie _  models decreases and finally almost diminishes for @xmath25 . fig .",
    "[ fig : plbeta ] shows the evolution of the anisotropy @xmath26 at the 90%-mass radius .",
    "the anisotropy parameter @xmath26 is defined as follows : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are one - dimensional tangential and radial velocity dispersions , respectively .",
    "the development of the radial anisotropy during the pre - collapse phase becomes strongly suppressed as @xmath16 decreases .",
    "this is simply because radial - orbit stars can easily escape from a small tidal radius cluster . as tli discussed , the emergence of a large number of radial - orbit stars is the reason for faster mass loss in the anisotropic models . for low @xmath16 clusters ,",
    "since there is almost no room for the radial anisotropy to develop , the _ ae _  model and the _ ie _  model do not differ very much in the evolution of the total mass .",
    "since king models have such low @xmath16 ( @xmath30 ) , the difference among the three models shown in fig .",
    "[ massfig ] can be understood from this viewpoint .",
    "the mass loss of the _ aa _  model should be always slower than that of the _ ae _  model because of the apocenter criterion ( see tli ) .",
    "note that we have assumed that the initial tidal radius is equal to the limiting radius of king models .",
    "this is a conventional way for setting up initial conditions of simulations , but not the only one ; these two radii can be different .",
    "finally in this section , we comment on the relation between the mass loss rate and the half - mass concentration for king models .",
    "johnstone ( 1993 , figure 2 ) and gnedin & ostriker ( 1997 , figure 6 ) found that for king models the mass loss rate per half - mass relaxation time ( exactly speaking , the inverse of the evaporation time in units of the initial half - mass relaxation time in gnedin & ostriker ) has a minimum around @xmath311.52 .",
    "johnstone ( 1993 ) calculated the evaporation rate for king models using the local fokker - planck equation , and gnedin & ostriker ( 1997 ) performed isotropic orbit - averaged fokker - planck simulations with the initial conditions of king models .",
    "their findings are qualitatively consistent with a simple estimation of the mass loss rate based on only the half - mass concentration @xmath16",
    ". naively one may think that the mass loss rate decreases as @xmath16 increases .",
    "in fact @xmath16 has the maximum at @xmath19 ( @xmath32 ) , where johnstone ( 1993 ) and gnedin & ostriker ( 1997 ) found the minimum evaporation rate .",
    "in addition johnstone ( 1993 ) found a local maximum of the mass loss rate at @xmath33 .",
    "this may correspond to the fact that @xmath16 has a local minimum at @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : king ] . as an additional reference , we show the mass loss rate per half - mass relaxation time @xmath36 calculated from the modified ambartsumian - spitzer formula ( spitzer 1987 , p.57 ; see also tli ) for king models in fig . [",
    "fig : king ] .",
    "this estimation is even quantitatively not very different from the result of more detailed calculations for @xmath37 by johnstone ( 1993 ) .",
    "there are growing evidences that the mass function in clusters as well as in the field is not a simple power - law , but should be approximated as composite power - laws ( e.g. , kroupa , tout & gilmore 1993 ) .",
    "however , we use simple power - laws in the present study of general evolution of clusters , for simplicity .",
    "the adoption of multiple composite power - laws is trivial task , but requires specification of more model parameters .",
    "the assumed initial mass function ( imf ) has the following form : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are constants . as in takahashi ( 1997 )",
    ", we use the discrete mass components .",
    "the @xmath41-th mass bin for equal @xmath42 interval can be obtained by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the number of components .",
    "the parameters determining the mass function are @xmath40 and @xmath45 .",
    "we use a few values of @xmath40 and @xmath46 for our model calculations .",
    "the issue of the effects of stellar evolution naturally comes out for multi - mass models if one extends the mass function to high mass stars .",
    "obviously the stellar evolution should have been the most important process in determining the early phase of the dynamical evolution of globular clusters .",
    "however , we will ignore the stellar evolution in this paper because it adds one more complexity to the models . without stellar evolution",
    ", the clusters usually undergo core - collapse before losing significant amount of stars unless the initial cluster has very low central concentration , because the time scale for the core collapse is generally much shorter than the evaporation time .",
    "note that the core collapse time is of order of @xmath47 while the evaporation time is typically of order of @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the initial half - mass relaxation time for single mass models .",
    "the core collapse is very much accelerated for multi - mass clusters , and the discrepancy between the evaporation time and the core collapse time could become even larger .",
    "therefore one needs to supply the mechanism that allows the evolution of cluster beyond the core collapse .",
    "we assumed that the heating is provided by binaries formed by three - body processes because it is easiest to implement in the framework of fokker - planck method .",
    "the evolution of parameters for the central parts such as density and velocity dispersion should depend on the detailed mechanism for driving the post core - collapse evolution , but most of the global properties do not sensitively depend on the heating mechanism . for our purposes ,",
    "three - body binary heating is sufficiently simple and easy to be used as heating mechanism .",
    "the heating formula for multi - mass clusters is taken from lee , fahlman & richer ( 1991 ) .",
    "we have used various initial models .",
    "the characteristics of the initial models are summarized in table 1 . in all models",
    ", we have assumed that the shape of density profiles of different mass components are the same with the different amplitudes dictated by the assumed mass functions .",
    "the velocity dispersions are assumed to be the same for all components .",
    "are assumed to have the same density and velocity profiles .",
    "the behaviour of the cluster up to the core collapse does not depend on the initial total mass or size of the cluster .",
    "but the amount of binary heating depends on the number of stars in the cluster .",
    "we have assumed that the mass of the cluster is @xmath50 for the model @xmath51 , and we have fixed the total number of stars at @xmath52 for other models . but",
    "this number only controls the central density during the postcollapse phase .",
    "most of our results does not really depend on the mass of the cluster , except for the surface density profiles .",
    "if we used higher initial mass , the core radii at a given epoch ( measured by the @xmath53 ) would be smaller .",
    "the minimum mass @xmath54 of the mass function was assumed to be 0.1 @xmath55 in all models .    throughout this paper",
    ", we use @xmath56 to represent the distance from the center of the cluster , and @xmath51 to represent the _ projected _ distance .",
    "we first describe the general behaviour of _ reference model _ ( model r )",
    "whose initial parameters are given in table 1 .",
    "this set of parameters is used by heggie et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to compare the outcomes of various computational methods .",

    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ massfig ] with different criteria for ejection of stars .",
    "unlike single component models , the mass loss rate is not a constant , but increases with time .",
    "the increase of @xmath57 is due to the fact that the mass function becomes flatter as the cluster loses mass .",
    "( the mass loss rate becomes larger for clusters with flatter mass function . ) as discussed in  3 , the apocenter criterion ( @xmath58 ) gives longer lifetime than the energy criterion ( @xmath59 ) , but it is not a significant effect . for comparison , we have also shown the mass evolution for the isotropic model ( @xmath60 ) with the same initial conditions .",
    "the time of maximum collapse is shown as dots in this figure .",
    "the behaviours of the degree of velocity anisotropy @xmath26 for the apocenter criterion are shown in figure [ aniso - apo ] .",
    "the upper , middle and lower panels show @xmath61 at the time @xmath53=0.7 , 0.5 and 0.2 , respectively .",

    "[ aniso - apo ] for the energy criterion is shown in fig .",
    "[ aniso - en ] .",
    "note that the sign of @xmath26 can be both positive ( radial anisotropy ) and negative ( tangential anisotropy ) .",
    "if a cluster is isolated , strong radial anisotropy develops in the halo for all components , as shown by takahashi ( 1997 ) .",
    "however the present model cluster is in a rather strong tidal field : the initial king model with @xmath9 has @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , from the discussion in ",
    "[ sec : ch ] , we may expect that the development of such radial anisotropy is strongly suppressed in the present case . from the profiles shown in fig .",

    "[ aniso - en ] ( _ ae _  model ) .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with isolated clusters where strong radial anisotropy develops among low mass components ( takahashi 1997 ) . in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ aniso - en ] , the high mass components also have tangential anisotropy . this is due to the initial cooling of the high mass components ( takahashi 1997 ) .",
    "the velocity distribution becomes mostly tangential near the tidal boundary regardless of the mass .",
    "the tangential anisotropy was also noted by oh & lin ( 1992 ) , and kim & oh ( 1999 ) from their hybrid calculation of n - body and fokker - planck .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath61 becomes different for apocenter and energy criteria in the outer parts , because the energy criterion forces @xmath26 at tidal boundary to become zero ( i.e. , isotropic ) .",

    "the density profiles at @xmath53=0.5 and 0.2 are similar for the apocenter condition and the energy condition .",
    "the big difference at @xmath53=0.7 is purely due to the fact that the core - collapse occurs when @xmath64 0.7 for the _ aa _  model while it occurs somewhat later for the _ ae _  model .",
    "therefore , the difference in the degree of anisotropy at outer radii does not play important role in determining the density distribution .",
    "the profiles at @xmath53=0.5 and 0.8 are compared with the isotropic model in fig .",
    "[ compare1 ] .",
    "the radial profiles of the total density of isotropic and anisotropic models have very little difference , but the detailed distribution of individual mass components could be significantly different for these two models . from these comparisons , we expect that there will be some difference in the behaviour of the mass function in the lower mass parts at late phase of the evolution .    in fig .",
    "[ compare2a ] , we tried to compare the surface density profiles of the @xmath65 model at @xmath53=0.5 with the best - fitting multi - mass king models having the same mass function .",

    "the constants @xmath70 should be determined by the given mass function . as in fig .",
    "[ compare1 ] , the profiles of density of low mass stars do not fit king models : if the distribution of combined density is to be reproduced , the central densities of low mass components of king model are higher than that generated by fokker - planck results .",
    "this means that the lower mass stars are more distributed at the outer parts than expected from king models .",
    "the mass segregation effect is greater than that predicted by multi - mass king models .",
    "this is the same trend that was seen from the comparisons between anisotropic and isotropic models .",
    "for the purpose of application to more realistic cases , we also attempted to fit the surface density profiles of _ visible _ components only , assuming that the highest mass bin ( @xmath71 ) represents the remnant stars such as neutron stars or massive white dwarfs .",
    "this is still far from more realistic situation because the extension of simple power - law to massive remnant will give results in too much contribution from these stars .",

    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ compare2b ] .",
    "the fitting model is the same as shown in fig .",
    "[ compare2a ] , but the difference between the king model and the fokker - planck model is more pronounced . choosing other parameters for king models would not help to improve the fitting :",
    "the difference simply is due to the fact that the distribution of stars are substantially different between king models and fokker - planck results . because of stronger mass segregation in fokker - planck results ,",
    "the fitting of profiles in the intermediate region gives significant differences in outer parts .",
    "the fitting does not improve when one attempts to use anisotropic king models ( king - michie models ) , because the king - michie models always have @xmath72 anisotropy regardless of mass , while the fokker - planck results give both radial and tangential anisotropy among different mass bins .",
    "the isotropic king models are usually better in reproducing the fokker - planck results .",
    "this is somewhat contradictory with the single component models : during the early phase of the evolution , king - michie models better represent the anisotropic fokker - planck results of tli than isotropic king models .      as described in ",

    "[ mfheggie ] .",
    "the epochs are chosen according to the mass of the cluster : @xmath81=0.8 , 0.7 , 0.6 , 0.5 , 0.4 , 0.3 , 0.2 and 0.1 .",
    "this figure clearly shows the flattening of the mass function as the cluster loses mass .",
    "also shown in this figure are the mass functions within the half - mass radius @xmath82 as dotted lines .",
    "the shape of the mass function deviates from the simple power - laws as a result of the selective mass loss : the average slope of the mass function decreases with time , and the slope of the mass function is steeper at lower mass than at higher mass .",
    "although the mass loss rate is larger for the lower mass , it is not sensitive enough to flatten toward the lower mass .",
    "such a behaviour ( i.e. , steeper slope at lower mass parts ) appears to be inconsistent with the observational data for a number of globular clusters ( e.g. , chabrier & mra 1997 ) . the initial mass function of the globular clusters should not be simple power - laws since the dynamical evolution only makes the situation worse , but it is likely to flatyten ( or even decreasing ) toward the lower mass",
    ".    the evolution of mass function as a function of time can be measured by the variation of the power - law index .",
    "suppose that the mass function can be approximated as a power - law with index @xmath40 as shown in equation ( [ eq : pmf ] ) . as seen from fig .",
    "[ mfheggie ] , it is clear that the mass function does not follow a single power law as the cluster loses mass .",
    "thus we have computed instantaneous @xmath40 at two different masses : @xmath83 and 0.55 @xmath55 .",
    "the behaviour of these indices is shown in fig [ alpha_hg ] as a function of @xmath84 .",
    "the solid lines represent @xmath85 ) and the dotted lines are for @xmath86 ) .",
    "since the mass function depends on the location as well , we have computed @xmath40 s within the entire cluster ( thick lines ) and within the half - mass radius ( thin lines ) .",
    "the trends toward the flatter mass function with time are clearly shown in this figure .",
    "the global mass function changes slowly in the early phase of the evolution , and rather abruptly in the late phase .",
    "the mass function within the half - mass radius changes more rapidly than the global mass function . the model with smaller @xmath46 gives more rapid variation in @xmath40 with time than that with higher @xmath46 , as shown in figs . [ alpha_hg ] and [ alpha_low ] .",
    "we also note here that the behaviour of @xmath40 for the isotropic fokker - planck model is very close to that of the anisotropic model .",
    "the variation of mass function observed by richer et al .",
    "( 1991 ) could be most attributed by the dynamical evolution since the mass function tends to be _",
    "flatter _ for clusters with short relaxation time .",
    "clusters with short relaxation time are likely to have lost significant fraction of the initial mass , mostly in the form of low mass stars .",
    "richer et al ( 1991 ) claim that there exists a tight relation between the disruption time @xmath87 and the power - law index of the mass function .",
    "although the amount of uncertainties is large , the trend of flattening of mass function for clusters with significant mass loss appears to be real .",
    "the accurate photometry over any entire globular cluster is very difficult .",
    "the luminosity function ( and thus mass function ) is usually measured in limited range of the cluster . since the mass function varies with the location if the cluster has undergone significant evolution , it is important to understand the relationship between the locally determined mass function and the ` global ' mass function .",
    "we have shown the variation of @xmath40 as a function of projected radius for three different epochs in fig .",
    "[ alpha_s ] for 0.2@xmath55 ( dotted lines ) and 0.55@xmath55 ( solid lines ) . also shown as horizontal lines are the power - law indices of the global mass function at that epoch .",
    "we have seen from fig .",
    "[ alpha_low ] that the global mass functions measured at 0.2 and 0.55 @xmath55 are rather similar .",
    "however , the local mass function changes by a great amount . the 0.2@xmath55 mass function varies slowly over radius , but 0.55 @xmath55 one varies a lot .",
    "this is due to the fact that the high mass stars are concentrated toward the central parts .",
    "thus one has to be very careful in determining the mass function from the observations .",
    "the power - law index of the global mass function at 0.2@xmath55 roughly coincides with the local value near the half - mass radius .",
    "the mass function near the half - mass radius appears to represent the global mass function , when measured at the lower mass .",
    "this is also seen in n - body calculations by vesperini & heggie ( 1997 ) .",
    "the power - law index at @xmath82 for 0.55 @xmath55 , however , deviates significantly from the global value .",
    "therefore , the determination of global mass function remains observationally challenging task .",
    "so far we have examined density profiles and mass functions .",
    "we should be able to obtain more detailed dynamical information by measuring the velocity dispersion profiles of the stars in the cluster . in principle , both projected and transverse velocities can be measured if the astrometric accuracy becomes of order of @xmath88 arcseconds , as the astrometric project of gaia is targeting . however , only the projected velocity information is available for most of the clusters in the galaxy .",
    "we now discuss the prediction of projected velocity dispersions of the cluster stars by our fokker - planck models .    in fig .",
    "[ vproj ] , we have plotted the projected velocity dispersion profiles for the model @xmath65 at @xmath53=0.7 , 0.5 and 0.2 for four different mass components , together with the corresponding @xmath60 at the same epoch ( measured by @xmath53 ) . the maximum collapse occurs near @xmath53=0.7 .",
    "the unit of velocity in this plot is @xmath89 .",
    "the behaviour of velocity profiles for @xmath90 model was not shown here , but we note that the velocity profiles of such a model behave similarly to those of isotropic model",
    ". this may be due to the similarity in tidal boundary condition .",
    "the @xmath58 model predicts the velocity profiles _ flatter _ than the isotropic model .",
    "since the cluster masses and the tidal radii are kept constant for different models , the difference in velocity profiles is related to the difference in cluster structure .",
    "for example , the @xmath58 model generally exhibits lower central velocity dispersion than the isotropic model .",
    "this means that the anisotropic model has _ larger _",
    "@xmath82 than the isotropic model .    near the tidal boundary ,",
    "the projected velocity profiles of the model @xmath58 deviate significantly from the isotropic model .",
    "there are even mild bumps at around 0.5 @xmath4 for low mass stars in late phase ( i.e. , @xmath91 ) .",
    "such a behaviour is only seen for low mass stars in @xmath58 models .",
    "closer examination of tangential and radial velocity dispersions revealed that the bump is caused by the tangential component .",
    "the radial component monotonically decreases like the isotropic model .",
    "the bumps appear in almost all models with apocenter criterion for low mass stars during late postcollapse phase , but not in other models .",
    "therefore , this phenomena is clearly related to the boundary conditions .",
    "we note here that the detailed observations by    drukier et al .",
    "( 1998 ) has discovered nearly flat or slightly rising velocity dispersions from m15 at the outer parts .",
    "this seems to be the indication of @xmath92 anisotropic velocity distribution in the outer parts of this cluster",
    ". it would be very desirable to carry out velocity measurements for other clusters .",
    "we have studied the evolution of multi - mass star clusters in the galactic tidal field including the effects of velocity anisotropy .",
    "the radial anisotropy developed by dynamical relaxation tends to be suppressed by the presence of the tidal boundary . except for very early epochs ,",
    "high mass stars show more radial ( larger @xmath26 ) anisotropy than low mass stars in general .",
    "as the cluster loses a large amount of mass from the tidal boundary , @xmath26 decreases , i.e. , anisotropy becomes more tangential for all mass species . as a result , at late epochs of the cluster s life",
    ", low mass stars generally have tangential ( negative @xmath26 ) anisotropy throughout the cluster , while high mass stars show weak radial anisotropy in the inner parts and tangential anisotropy in the outer parts .",
    "the overall degree of anisotropy depends on the half - mass concentration @xmath16 of the cluster .",
    "larger @xmath16 clusters allow the development of stronger radial anisotropy in the halo .",
    "depending on the treatment of the tidal boundary condition , the detailed behaviour of the degree of anisotropy over radius changes near the tidal radius .",
    "the apocenter criterion gives nearly tangential motion for the stars near the tidal radius but the energy criterion forces isotropy there .",
    "the density profiles of tidally limited clusters are compared with the king models . because of complex behaviour of the degree of anisotropy , finding the best - fitting king models becomes very difficult .",
    "the isotropic king models tend to give flatter profiles for low mass components compared to the fokker - planck results when the overall density profiles are matched .",
    "introduction of radial anisotropy gives only worse fits , because most of the anisotropy is _",
    "tangential_.    we discussed the adequacy of converting the observed local mass function to the global mass function assuming that the cluster can be approximated by isotropic multi - mass king models . because of the discrepancy between king models and fokker - planck results",
    ", this process gives somewhat erroneous results of mass function for low mass components .",
    "we also looked for the best place where the local mass function is close to the global mass function and found that the half - mass radius should be a reasonable place .",
    "the mass function inevitably changes with time because of the selective loss of mass .",
    "the power - law indices of the mass function is found to be well correlated with the fraction of mass evaporated _ via tidal overflow_. the amount of fractional mass loss can be determined by observed value of @xmath93 and assuming the constant escape probability and coeval formation of all globular clusters . the observational data for the mass function are found to be consistent with the notion that the mass function is strongly influenced by the dynamical processes ( e.g. , richer et al .",
    "1990 ; piotto & zoccali 1999 ) , but imf itself may have been quite different from cluster to cluster : some clusters may have formed with very steep imf .",
    "the projected velocity profiles of anisotropic models with apocenter criterion show significant deviation from isotropic models or anisotropic models with energy condition in the sense that the velocity profiles are much flatter for @xmath58 models in the outer parts during the postcollapse phase .",
    "this phenomena appears to be consistent with the observational data for m15 .",
