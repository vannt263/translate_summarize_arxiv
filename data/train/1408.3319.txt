    "we observed a resistive superconducting transition in samples with rrr greater than 34 and residual resistivity less than 5 @xmath6 cm .",
    "the @xmath4 was found to be as high as 1.2 k with a relatively sharp transition compared to the transition in a polycrystalline sample , but the onset of the transition is somewhat lower in the single crystal sample .",
    "however , improvements of rrr from 34 to 60 do not lead to any systematic changes in @xmath4 . specific heat was measured in samples which show relatively sharp , resistive superconducting transitions at temperature @xmath11 k , but no anomaly associated with superconductivity was observed down to 0.4 k. the absence of features in specific heat suggests that the superconductivity observed in this compound is either of filamentary , strain stabilized superconductivity associated with small amounts of stressed yfe@xmath0ge@xmath0 possibly at twin boundaries or dislocations or is a second crystallographic phase present at level below our detection capability .",
