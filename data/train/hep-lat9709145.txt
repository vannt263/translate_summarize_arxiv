    "over the past few years the su(2 ) higgs model in three dimensions has been the subject of many thorough numerical studies by means of lattice monte carlo simulations @xcite  @xcite .",
    "the main incentive for these investigations was to clarify the nature of the electroweak phase transition in the framework of the dimensional reduction programme @xcite , where it is much easier to obtain precise numerical results than in the full four - dimensional theory at finite temperature @xcite . in these studies",
    "it has been established that the electroweak phase transition is weakly first order for higgs masses up to @xmath6 , while for higgs masses @xmath7 the transition disappears and turns into a smooth crossover @xcite .",
    "hence , the higgs region and the confinement region in parameter space are indeed analytically connected , as was conjectured a long time ago for models with fixed - length higgs fields @xcite .",
    "a review of the existing lattice results as well as a comparison with perturbation theory can be found in @xcite .",
    "while the nature of the phase diagram and the order of the phase transition are now well determined , our understanding of the symmetric phase is still incomplete .",
    "calculations of the mass spectrum based on the use of gauge - invariant operators lead to a picture of a confining symmetric phase with a dense spectrum of bound states .",
    "recent attempts to describe the spectrum in terms of bound state models may be found in @xcite .",
    "this part of the phase diagram is of great intrinsic interest because it exhibits the same qualitative behaviour as qcd . in this region",
    "the non - abelian gauge theory has confining properties , yet the presence of matter fields in the fundamental representation leads eventually to the screening of charges at large distances .",
    "this apparent similarity between qcd and the symmetric phase of scalar - gauge models opens the possibility to study some aspects of qcd in a model that is computationally much less demanding .    in the higgs phase , on the other hand , for small enough scalar couplings a perturbative calculation of the spectrum is applicable and leads to results in good agreement with those from lattice simulations . due to the analytic connectedness of the phase diagram",
    "all mass eigenstates in the higgs region may be continuously mapped into their counterparts in the confinement region .",
    "this offers the possibility to study the onset of non - perturbative physics and confinement by smoothly moving from the higgs region into the confinement region of the phase diagram .    in this paper",
    "we elaborate on our previous computation of the mass spectrum of the su(2 ) higgs model in 2 + 1 dimensions@xcite . here , however , we move away from the original context of the electroweak phase transition , and our main interest lies in the dynamics of the three - dimensional theory and what it might have in common with qcd .",
    "in particular , we want to obtain a more complete picture of the excitation spectrum and investigate in more detail the previously observed approximate decoupling of the scalar and gauge sectors of the model@xcite .",
    "thus , in addition to the @xmath8 and @xmath9 states considered before , we now also compute correlations of @xmath1 and polyakov loop operators .",
    "although our analysis does not yet incorporate multiparticle states , it leads to a more complete picture of the symmetric phase .",
    "in contrast to our previous work , where we carefully studied the approach to the continuum limit , we now consider the theory at a fixed value of the gauge coupling , i.e. @xmath10 , where our earlier results show that the physics is already very close to the continuum limit .",
    "furthermore , at large scalar coupling it has been demonstrated numerically@xcite that the disappearance of the phase transition survives in the continuum limit and that no significant lattice artefacts are to be expected for @xmath10 .",
    "our main results are as follows .",
    "the previously observed approximate decoupling of states composed purely out of gauge degrees of freedom in the @xmath8 channel@xcite extends to the @xmath1 channel .",
    "the masses of these states are very close to their values in the pure gauge theory .",
    "furthermore , the decoupling occurs at both small and large values of the scalar self - coupling , and in the latter case it can be observed also deep in the crossover region .",
    "second , at large scalar coupling we find that a dense spectrum of states is observed even in the higgs phase , yet the underlying dynamics must be quite different , as confinement is no longer observed .",
    "we present a scenario how the confining properties of the theory are lost inside the crossover region : within the qcd context it is natural to use the concept of flux tubes in the symmetric phase as a manifestation of confinement .",
    "as one enters the crossover region the flux tube develops a rapidly growing decay width and eventually becomes so unstable that there is no longer any remnant of linear confinement ( i.e. a range of distances where the static potential shows a linear behaviour ) .",
    "finally , the inclusion of correlations of polyakov loops changes some of our previous conclusions about the influence of finite - volume effects .",
    "in particular , we find that finite - size effects , especially in the lowest @xmath8 state are less severe than was claimed before@xcite .",
    "some of the results presented in this paper have been summarised elsewhere@xcite .",
    "we also draw the reader s attention to some recent related work@xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organised as follows . in section2",
    "we briefly summarise the lattice techniques used in this work .",
    "section3 contains a discussion and comparison of the properties of the higgs and confinement phases for small scalar self - coupling . in section4",
    "we describe how the properties of the higgs and confinement regions of the phase diagram change when the size of the scalar self - coupling is increased . in section5",
    "we follow the analytic connection of the mass spectrum through the crossover .",
    "results indicating flux tube decay in the crossover region are presented in section6 , and section7 contains our conclusions .",
    "we work with the three - dimensional lattice action given by [ actlat ] s[u,]&=&_g_p(1-u_p ) + _",
    "x\\{-_h_=1 ^ 3 ( ^(x)u_(x ) ( x+ ) ) + & & + ( ^(x)(x ) ) + _ r^2 } , where @xmath11 is the link variable , @xmath12 denotes the plaquette , and @xmath13 is the scalar field .",
    "the bare parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the inverse gauge coupling , the scalar hopping parameter , and scalar self - coupling , respectively . in our simulations we fix the combination of parameters = , where @xmath16 is the ratio of the scalar self - coupling and the gauge coupling in the continuum formulation .",
    "exact relations between the lattice and the continuum parameters at the two - loop level governing the approach to the continuum limit can be found in @xcite . in this work",
    "we consider the cases of small , i.e. @xmath17 and large , i.e. @xmath18 scalar self - coupling , by choosing @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively . at the small value , which was used in our earlier study@xcite ,",
    "the confinement and higgs phases are separated by a first order phase transition , whereas for the larger value of @xmath16 the transition has turned into a smooth crossover is proportional to the ratio of higgs and @xmath21-boson masses in the four - dimensional theory at finite temperature . as an orientation for those readers who are familiar with studies of the electroweak phase transition",
    ", we add that in the framework of dimensional reduction , our values of @xmath16 correspond to tree - level , zero temperature higgs masses of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively@xcite . ] .      in any mass calculation on the lattice",
    "it is important to have a good projection property of the interpolating operators in order to obtain a reliable signal .",
    "for gauge theories with or without scalar fields it has been demonstrated that the projection of the basic operators onto the desired state can be considerably enhanced by employing so - called `` blocking '' or `` fuzzing '' techniques@xcite .    as in our previous work@xcite ,",
    "we construct blocked link variables @xmath24 at blocking level  @xmath25 according to the procedure originally defined in@xcite .",
    "furthermore , a blocked version of the scalar field , @xmath26 at blocking level  @xmath25 is constructed according to ^(n)(x)=\\{^(n-1)(x)+_j=1 ^ 2}. note that we will take correlations in the @xmath27 direction and so our blocking always remains within the @xmath28-plane .",
    "in addition , we consider blocked scalar fields @xmath29 with non - local contributions from one spatial direction  @xmath30 only : ^(n , j)(x)=\\{^(n-1,j)(x ) & + & u_j^(n-1)(x)^(n-1,j)(x+ ) + & + & u_j^(n-1)(x-)^(n-1,j)(x-)},j=1,2 . [ eqasymblock ]",
    "it is obvious that all blocking procedures employed are gauge invariant and can be iterated in order to create a large set of operators of various spatial extensions in an efficient manner . in practice ,",
    "the blocking levels have to be tuned in order to identify the operators with the best projection properties .",
    "we now proceed to list the basic operators used in our simulation .",
    "since we use a larger set of operators compared to our previous calculation , we have decided to change our notation slightly for clarity .",
    "although in general we use blocked links and scalar fields , we suppress the superscripts which label the blocking level in this subsection , except when stated explicitly .",
    "after decomposing the scalar field @xmath13 as ( x)=(x)(x),(x)0,(x ) su(2 ) , we consider the following basic operators involving only scalar fields or combinations of scalar and gauge degrees of freedom : r(x ) & & ( ^(x)(x ) ) , + l_j(x ) & & ( ^(x)u_j(x)(x+)),j=1,2 + v_j^a(x ) & & ( ^a^(x)u_j(x)(x+)),j=1,2 , [ eq_rlv ] where @xmath31 is a pauli matrix .",
    "note that at this stage we have not yet specified the quantum numbers @xmath32 of the operators .",
    "this is postponed to the end of this subsection when all basic operators have already been defined .",
    "we also consider wilson loops @xmath33 , i.e. gauge invariant operators constructed out of link variables only , e.g. c_ij^11(x)= ( u_i(x)u_j(x+)u^_i(x+)u^_j(x ) ) , i , j=1,2,i = j , [ eq_c ] and in addition to the elementary plaquette @xmath34 , we also consider squares of size @xmath35 as well as rectangles of size @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "hence , we have five versions of wilson loop operators , viz .",
    "c_ij^11,c_ij^22,c_ij^12 , c_ij^13,c_ij^23 .",
    "as we shall see , a larger set of this type of operator will significantly improve our ability to extract information about the gauge sector of the theory .    an operator which is useful to probe the confining properties of a theory",
    "is the polyakov loop , i.e. a loop of length @xmath39 of link variables that winds around the spatial dimensions of the lattice , viz .",
    "p_j^(l)(x)=_m=0^l-1u_j(x+m ) , j=1,2 .",
    "[ eq_polya ] the expectation value of the polyakov loop vanishes if the theory is confining , and it projects onto the state consisting of a chromoelectric flux loop that closes through the boundary in the @xmath40 direction .",
    "correlations of @xmath41 can then be used to extract a string tension from the lowest mode of its exponential fall - off , the so - called `` torelon '' mass . however , in a theory with matter fields , such as ours , one eventually expects the string to break beyond some large separation , due to pair creation ( just as in qcd ) . in our model",
    "we also have a phase with spontaneously broken symmetry , the higgs phase . here , this interpretation of the polyakov loop correlator no longer holds , the polyakov loop has a large expectation value , and the torelon mass can not be used to extract a string tension . instead",
    ", since a weak coupling expansion of the polyakov loop correlator applies in the higgs phase , its leading term corresponds to an exchange of two spin-1 particles ( i.e. @xmath21-bosons ) , and therefore the lightest mass above the vacuum should be interpreted as a two-@xmath21 scattering state .    apart from being relevant for the study of confinement",
    ", the polyakov loop also plays an important rle in understanding apparent finite - size effects in glueball calculations in the pure gauge theory@xcite .",
    "since we are interested in the detailed structure of the spectrum , and , in particular , higher excitations , we need to address the influence of torelons in the various spin channels .",
    "although single torelons , arising from correlations of the polyakov loop @xmath41 can not contribute directly to correlations of operators @xmath42 , they may well be relevant for the operators @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "this is because of the iterative , non - local nature of the blocking procedure , such that highly blocked versions of @xmath43 and @xmath44 may contain contributions which , for periodic boundary conditions , wind around the lattice and may thus have a sizeable projection onto @xmath41 . furthermore , torelon - antitorelon pairs are known to give rise to large finite - volume effects in glueball calculations@xcite . apart from studying correlations of polyakov loops _ per se _ , we have decided to construct single - torelon and torelon - pair operators in the @xmath8 and @xmath1 channels and to study their correlations as a safeguard against finite - size effects .",

    "our list of operators does not contain multiparticle operators , and therefore we do not have control over continuum states in the spectrum . here",
    "we wish to remark that we have evidence that continuum states have only small overlaps on the basis of operators used in this work , so that we are still able to extract the bound state mass spectrum reliably .      in order to compute the excitation spectrum of states with given quantum numbers , we construct matrix correlators by measuring all cross correlations between different types of operators at several blocking levels@xcite .",
    "this correlation matrix can then be diagonalised numerically following a variational method . for a given set of @xmath65 operators @xmath66",
    "we find the linear combination that minimises the energy , corresponding to the lightest state .",
    "the first excitation can be found by applying the same procedure to the subspace @xmath67 which is orthogonal to the ground state .",

    "the quality of the approximation clearly depends on the number  @xmath65 of original operators and their projection properties .",
    "the determined eigenstates are removed from the basis for the higher excitations , so that the basis for the latter gets smaller and the corresponding higher states are determined less reliably .    for our main spectrum calculation",
    "we work with @xmath72 operators in the @xmath8 channel , i.e. @xmath73 , each considered for at least two blocking levels . in the @xmath1 channel",
    "we choose @xmath74 and @xmath75 . in the symmetric phase",

    "we construct a @xmath76 matrix correlator from the operator of type  @xmath55 considered at four blocking levels .",
    "thereby we can extract masses for the first two or three states only . in the computation of separate correlations of the polyakov loop operator itself",
    ", we also compute a @xmath76 matrix correlator using different blocking levels .",
    "for a more detailed discussion of the variational method based on matrix correlators , along with numerical investigations to test its efficiency , we refer to our previous work@xcite .      the monte carlo simulation of the lattice action in eq.([actlat ] )",
    "is performed using the same algorithms as in our previous work .",
    "the bare parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 are fixed by applying the constraints @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively , and using the same procedure as in section3 of ref.@xcite . for the update of gauge variables we use a combination of the standard heatbath and over - relaxation algorithms for su(2)@xcite .",
    "the scalar degrees of freedom are updated using the algorithm described in@xcite .",
    "in general , the applicability of this algorithm is restricted to cases where the self - coupling @xmath15 is not too large , as otherwise the acceptance rate decreases substantially .",
    "in our simulation , however , we did not observe any significant drop in the acceptance rate , even at our larger value of @xmath15 .",
    "thus the algorithm may be applied safely in the region of the parameter space explored in this paper .    as before ,",
    "we define a `` compound '' sweep to consist of a combination of one heatbath and several over - relaxation updates of the gauge and scalar fields . in the higgs and confinement regions of the phase diagram at both small and large scalar coupling we typically gathered about 12000 compound sweeps for our main spectrum calculation . in the crossover region",
    "we also monitored the spectrum at several , closely spaced values of @xmath77 , for which about 5000 compound sweeps were accumulated each .",
    "thus , the statistics in our present study is much lower than in our previous work . at first sight",
    "this may seem surprising , since we now seek to obtain a more detailed structure of the mass spectrum .",
    "however , we wish to remark that our basis of operators is much larger than in@xcite , so that a loss in statistics is compensated for by using the information from a greater number of correlators in a particular channel .",
    "in addition , the diagonalisation procedure requires a large basis of operators in order to yield reliable results for the excitation spectrum .",
    "our standard lattice sizes in this study are @xmath78 and @xmath79 , which , on the basis of our previous study , do not lead to significant finite - size effects in the @xmath8 and @xmath9 channels . in order to study finite - volume effects in more detail , especially in the @xmath1 channel",
    ", we have also simulated lattices of size @xmath80 .",

    "subsection3.4 in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "we have checked explicitly that the alternative fitting formula motivated in@xcite , where an additional constant is considered , does not produce an appreciable difference in our mass estimates .    in cases where the effective masses calculated from the correlation function did not show a plateau long enough to perform a correlated fit",
    ", we used effective masses for our best estimates .",
    "this was also our preferred method for the scan of the crossover region , where we were more interested in qualitative features rather than very precise mass estimates .",
    "results which were obtained from effective masses , or from eigenstates whose individual overlaps @xmath69 were small throughout , are marked by an asterisk in our data tables in sections[secsmall ] and[seclarge ] .",
    "statistical errors are estimated using a jackknife procedure for which the individual measurements have been accumulated in bins of 500 sweeps .",
    "for some of our most precise results we also quote a systematic error , which was obtained by quoting the difference between our best estimate and the result from an uncorrelated fit , and , in some cases , the result obtained using an alternative fitting interval .",
    "to explore small scalar coupling physics we fix @xmath82 as in ref.@xcite . for this value",
    "the system exhibits a strong first order transition upon variation of @xmath83 and the higgs and confinement properties on each side of the transition are very pronounced and easily distinguishable . in the symmetric phase we choose the point @xmath84 and in the higgs phase @xmath85 .",
    "the @xmath8 and @xmath9 channels of the mass spectrum at these parameter values have already been determined in our previous work @xcite . here",
    "we repeat this calculation with a larger basis of operators in order to obtain more details about the excitation spectrum .",
    "we do so at @xmath10 , where we know from our previous study that we are already close to the continuum limit of the theory .",
    "the lowest states of the mass spectrum at the two points investigated are shown in fig.[spec_lsmall](a ) . in the confinement region",
    "one observes the now familiar , dense spectrum of states for the three spin channels . as an illustration of the contributions of different types of basic operators to the mass eigenstates ,",
    "we plot the coefficients @xmath69 ( c.f .",
    "eq.([eigen ] ) ) in fig.[spec_lsmall](b ) for the lowest five eigenstates in the @xmath8 channel in the confining phase .",
    "our main results in the higgs phase are listed in table[mhiggs_low ] . here , the only low - lying states are the familiar higgs and @xmath21-boson states , which are also well described by perturbation theory .",
    "note in particular that the lowest mass in the @xmath1 channel is rather large and consistent with that of a @xmath86-scattering state  as are the excited states in the @xmath8 channel .",
    "in particular , consider one of the first excited states in the @xmath8 channel .",
    "this state has almost exclusively contributions from wilson loops , i.e. it consists mainly of gauge degrees of freedom .",
    "this suggests interpreting it as a @xmath86-scattering state , and table[mhiggs_low ] shows that the mass of this state is indeed compatible with twice the @xmath21-mass .",
    "this result is also expected from perturbation theory , where the term with the slowest exponential fall - off corresponds to a two-@xmath21 exchange diagram .",
    "it is natural to ask at this point why we do not see a two - higgs state as the first excitation , since such a state is lighter than the two-@xmath21 state .",
    "the reason is that our operators appear to have practically no projection on such a state . in order to see a two - higgs state it would be necessary to study the correlations of an operator which by construction couples to such a state in leading order , for instance @xmath87 .",
    "this , however , is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "._[mhiggs_low ] results for all three spin channels in the higgs region at @xmath85 .",
    "the second error in some results is an estimate of systematic errors as described in subsect.[secanalysis ] . _ [ cols=\"^,>,<,>,<,^ \" , ]",
    "as we have seen in the last section , the mass spectra of the higgs and confinement regions are rather similar at large scalar coupling , although the underlying dynamics must be quite different .",
    "since there is no phase transition but only a smooth crossover  separating \" the respective regions at large scalar coupling one can study how the spectra are continuously connected . apart from mapping the spectra in the higgs and confinement regions onto each other ,",
    "this also offers the opportunity to follow the change in the dynamics as one moves from one regime into the other .",
    "we start by considering the expectation values of the polyakov loop and the length of the higgs field , displayed in fig .",
    "[ vev ] . in most simulations dealing with the phase transition",
    "@xmath46 has been used as an  order parameter \" , as it jumps across a first order phase transition from small values in the confinement phase to large values in the higgs phase . as fig .",
    "[ vev ] illustrates , this jump has entirely disappeared , the change in @xmath88 is smooth and very slow , with its values differing by only @xmath89 at the end points studied in the last section . on the other hand , as mentioned in the previous section , the expectation value of the polyakov line is quite different at both ends of the curve . because it probes confining behaviour and the change in dynamics in this region of parameter space , the expectation value of the polyakov loop is more sensitive to the changes between the regions and hence makes a better  order parameter \" .",
    "however , strictly speaking it has to remain non - zero on the confinement side as well , so the change is smooth and quantitative only , as expected for a crossover .    despite the smoothness of the crossover , it is possible to define a critical hopping parameter through the peak of the susceptibility of various quantities .",
    "we obtained the best signal for the susceptibility of a smeared version of our @xmath46-operator , = r^2 - r ^2 . in fig .",
    "[ vev](b ) one easily identifies a pronounced peak in the susceptibility indicating large fluctuations in the operator under consideration . as in ref .",
    "@xcite this peak serves to locate the critical value of the hopping parameter @xmath90 at which the crossover takes place , and thus still represents a line  separating \" the higgs and confinement regions even in the absence of a phase transition . at @xmath91",
    "we estimate it to be @xmath92 .",
    "the variation of the lowest states in the @xmath8 and @xmath9-channels along the crossover is shown in fig .",
    "[ mcross ] .",
    "the mass of the lightest state of the theory , the @xmath8 ground state , shows a dip as the crossover is traversed .",
    "we have measured this mass on lattices of size @xmath93 and found no lowering of the mass with increasing lattice size .",
    "this means that essentially the infinite volume mass is reached and that the physical ground state mass definitely stays non - zero at the critical coupling .",
    "this identifies the transition unambiguously as a crossover@xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the mass of the third excited state , corresponding to the glueball on the confinement side , does not change through the crossover region until well into the higgs region .",
    "this is yet another manifestation of its decoupling , this time it proves stable under variation of another scalar coupling parameter , the hopping parameter @xmath83 .    in the @xmath9 channel",
    "we show only the lightest state and the first excitation , as our basis is smaller in this channel .",
    "the lowest state clearly becomes lighter as one changes from the confinement region to the higgs region .",
    "when the parameter @xmath83 is varied through the crossover some states change their ordering in mass , so that we felt unable to assign distinct symbols to some of the states in fig.[mcross](a ) . in these cases",
    "the question arises how one identifies the individual states .",
    "a useful criterion is to look at the composition of the mass eigenstates in terms of the original operators used . as an example",
    ", we show the variation of the operator content of the @xmath8 ground state and glueball through the crossover region in fig .",
    "[ crosscomp ] .",
    "the figure exhibits a remarkable phenomenon concerning the mixing of operators .",
    "as one moves from the confinement region towards the higgs region , the scalar ground state picks up more contributions from purely `` gluonic '' operators .",
    "the mixing of scalar and gluonic operators is strongest in the middle of the crossover , at the critical coupling @xmath90 .",
    "this is not unexpected given the fact that here the fluctuations are strongest .",
    "although there is now a significant gauge contribution to the lowest state , it still remains clearly dominated by scalar operators . moving into the higgs region the gauge contribution declines again and settles at some low value .",
    "looking at the composition of the glueball , however , we do not see the analogous feature happening .",
    "in contrast , the glueball maintains its almost pure gauge composition throughout the crossover beyond the critical coupling , with equally low overlap with the polyakov loop .",
    "only as one moves clearly into the higgs phase does the glueball give up its purely gluonic nature , consistent with the decoupling observed from the behaviour of its mass .",
    "given the intrinsic interest of this decoupling phenomenon it is worth investigating it in more detail .",
    "to do so we take the lowest 13 states in the @xmath8 sector and display for each state the maximum overlap onto scalar ( @xmath46 or @xmath39 ) operators as well as the maximum overlap onto the wilson loop @xmath94 operators .",
    "we do so separately for our extreme confining and higgs coupling values as well as for three values of @xmath77 that correspond to traversing the crossover region from near the edge ( on the confining side ) to near the pseudo - critical value , @xmath95 .",
    "the corresponding plots are shown on the left of fig .",
    "[ scatter ] .",
    "( errors are not shown since they are small . )",
    "those points shown as crosses correspond to states with substantial overlap onto flux loop operators . if the states had random scalar - gauge content , the points would be scattered over the whole plot . on the other hand , if there was a total scalar - gauge decoupling , then one or the other coordinate of each point would be zero .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ scatter ] that the latter is close to being the case in the confining phase and that this persists , although more weakly , as we traverse the crossover region . in the higgs phase",
    ", however , any decoupling effect is clearly much weaker .",
    "note the increasing number of states with a substantial flux loop overlap , as we traverse the crossover towards the higgs region .",
    "this is a manifestation of the increasing instability of the confining flux tube that we shall discuss in more detail below .    also in fig .",
    "[ scatter ] , on the right , we show similar plots for the @xmath1 . in this case",
    "we show the errors because several of them are large .",
    "the reason for such large errors is that we have two almost degenerate states whose order is inverted in some measurements , relative to other measurements .",
    "that is to say , any point with large errors is definitely not an approximate state of the system and should hence be disregarded .",
    "if we do disregard those  states \" then we see that we have a picture very similar to the one we obtained for the @xmath8 : a marked scalar - gauge decoupling in the confining region that only begins to weaken at the very centre of the crossover region",
    ". indeed there seems to be some remnant of it even in the higgs phase .",
    "when comparing the spectrum on the higgs and confinement side of the first - order phase transition at small scalar coupling we discussed the different interpretations that the mass governing the exponential fall - off of the polyakov line operator has : on the higgs side it can be identified with the volume - independent mass of a two-@xmath21 scattering state while on the confinement side it rises linearly with the lattice size and represents a flux loop .",
    "these different behaviours represent the different dynamics in the two regimes . in this section",
    "we try to answer the question how the physics changes from the former interpretation to the latter .",
    "we know that the two regimes are analytically connected , and so are the mass eigenstates of the higgs and confinement regimes .",
    "hence , there must also be a smooth transition in the projection of the polyakov line operator .",
    "first , we note that we lose the signal for the mass @xmath96 as we move into the crossover region from either side . at the end - points in both regimes",
    "we do see plateaux in the effective mass , but they are lost when moving closer towards @xmath90 .",
    "the situation is not improved by increasing the statistics .",
    "second , let us recall that the polyakov loop operator has an increasing projection onto the scalar ground state towards the middle of the crossover .",
    "these two observations may be given a physical interpretation .",
    "on the confinement side of the crossover we saw already a small non - vanishing expectation value for the polyakov loop operator",
    ". nevertheless , the mass extracted from the exponential fall - off of its correlator still exhibits the linear dependence on the lattice size and hence represents a flux loop winding around the lattice , despite the fact that our model permits screening , due to the presence of matter fields . as we move to the critical point the polyakov loop develops a large expectation value which signals the loss of linear confinement , and the fact that flux loops no longer exist .",
    "the question then is , what happens to the flux loop as the parameters are changed ?",
    "the increasing overlap of the polyakov loop with the @xmath8 ground state suggests a natural explanation : as we move out of the confining region the flux loop becomes more and more unstable , as it is increasingly easy to pair - produce scalars that screen the flux .",
    "the @xmath8 ground state is one possible decay product , just based on quantum numbers .",
    "a stronger mixing between this state and the flux loop may thus indicate the increasing instability of the latter .    in order to elaborate on this point",
    "we consider the overlap of the polyakov loop with all the @xmath8 eigenstates .",
    "if the suggested picture is true then all these states are possible decay products .",
    "of course , there are other decay products as well , like pairs of @xmath9 particles etc . for a first qualitative test of our picture",
    "it is however sufficient to consider just the single particle states .",
    "let us now treat the flux loop like a decaying resonance .",
    "as long as it is stable , its two - point correlation function has a pole at its mass .",
    "when the resonance becomes unstable the pole is shifted away from the real axis .",
    "the real part of the pole is then equal to the sum of the masses of the decay products , weighted by the branching ratios for the particular decay channel . in analogy to this consideration we now define an  effective flux loop mass \" by the sum of the masses of the @xmath8 eigenstates , weighted by their maximal overlap onto a polyakov line operator , ae_f . in the same manner",
    "we construct the average square of the flux loop energy , @xmath97 . from these",
    "we then obtain the  width \" of the flux loop as the root mean square fluctuation ( a_f)^2=(ae_f)^2 - ae_f ^2 .",
    "these two quantities are plotted through the crossover region in fig .",
    "[ gamma ] .",
    "indeed , the decay width defined in this way is nearly zero on the confinement side and then increases smoothly as it approaches the critical coupling .",
    "it then maintains its higher value on the higgs side indicating the instability and non - existence of flux loops on this side of the transition .",
    "we conclude that , although the spectra are very similar on both sides of the critical @xmath90 for large scalar coupling , we have clear evidence for a pronounced change in the dynamics as one moves from the confining to the higgs region .",
    "in particular it is possible to demonstrate the growing instability of flux loops through the transition .",
    "we remark , however , that the concept of a flux loop only exists in a finite volume , and thus this analysis does not have an infinite - volume limit .",
    "nevertheless we would expect the same phenomena to happen if one were to investigate the physical flux tube between two static external charges at a given separation and then change the parameters from the confining regime to the higgs regime .",
    "in this paper we have extended our previous work on the @xmath98-dimensional su(2 ) gauge - fundamental higgs model in various ways .",
    "firstly , we have added the @xmath1 mass spectrum to our previous calculations of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 spectra .",
    "secondly we have added operators based on polyakov loops .",
    "if we have confinement then these loops will project onto chromoelectric flux loops ( `` torelons '' ) that close through one of the periodic spatial boundaries . in that case",
    "the lightest mass extracted from the correlation function of such an operator will be proportional to the lattice spatial size , and its mass density will give the confining string tension ( up to corrections , the leading one of which is universal and known ) .",
    "this allows us to probe directly the confining properties of the theory at various points in the phase diagram . at the same time",
    "we have extended our basis of operators in the mass spectrum calculations ; in part by the inclusion of these torelon operators and also products of them .",
    "this provides us with a much better control of finite - volume effects .",
    "we have in addition performed the calculations not only for the small scalar self - coupling at which our previous simulations were carried out , but also for a large value of the scalar coupling where no phase transition separates the symmetric and higgs phases .",
    "here we have performed calculations through the crossover region that separates these two phases .",
    "in all these calculations we have used only a single value of the inverse gauge coupling , but one for which our earlier calculations assure us that lattice corrections to the continuum limit are already small .    as well as extending our previous calculations ,",
    "we have also shifted the emphasis of our physics interest away from the electroweak theory at finite temperature to dynamical phenomena that may be relevant to that other theory with gauge fields and charges in the fundamental representation : quantum chromodynamics .",
    "so one major focus of our interest has been confinement . at small scalar self - coupling",
    "we find that the torelon mass increases ( approximately ) linearly with its length and hence that the symmetric phase is confining .",
    "of course we know that , just as in qcd , flux tubes will be broken through the pair creation of fundamental charges , but within our errors we see no sign of this .",
    "the string tension is almost identical to its pure gauge value .",
    "by contrast , in the higgs phase , we see what perturbation theory tells us to expect : the polyakov loop operator couples to a @xmath86-scattering state instead of to the now non - existent flux tube .",
    "indeed , apart from the higgs scalar , @xmath86-scattering states are all we see in the @xmath8 and @xmath1 spectra .",
    "more intriguing is the situation for large scalar self - coupling .",
    "here we once again have a symmetric phase that shows linear confinement and a higgs phase where linear confinement is absent .",
    "however , now there is no first - order transition between the two phases , only a smooth crossover .",
    "this raises the question of how the dynamics can smoothly interpolate between the two phases .",
    "we provided evidence for the following picture . in the pure gauge theory",
    "a flux loop joined upon itself through a boundary is a stable state ( of the finite volume hamiltonian ) . with fundamental charges present",
    "such a state can decay .",
    "far from the crossover such decays are strongly suppressed and the flux loop will be almost stable : a resonance with a very narrow decay width . as we enter the crossover region",
    "the decay width becomes rapidly larger : so the pole in the complex energy plane moves rapidly away from the real axis . as ( initially ) a secondary effect ,",
    "the real part will also change , because of the newly enhanced intermediate states , and so the mass will shift as well . at some point , near the centre of the crossover , the pole is so far from the real axis that one completely loses a particle interpretation . at this point",
    "it is no longer useful to talk of confining flux tubes .",
    "we have found it convenient to use a periodic flux loop on a finite volume as a probe of confinement , but one can clearly use a finite flux line between fundamental sources / charges equally well .",
    "our second major interest has been the approximate decoupling between scalar and gauge degrees of freedom which we observed in our previous work .",
    "there we found that in the symmetric phase there are states which are almost entirely gluonic and the masses of these states coincide with the glueball masses of the pure gauge theory .",
    "we now find that this occurs not only in the @xmath8 sector , but also in the @xmath1 sector , and at large scalar self - coupling as well as at small .",
    "moreover this phenomenon only gradually disappears as we move through the crossover to the higgs phase . indeed , there is some evidence that a remnant of this phenomenon survives even in the higgs phase .",
    "amongst other things this tells us that the mixing between glueballs and states composed of fundamental charges is strongly suppressed , at least as long as we have some remnant of linear confinement .",
    "it also tells us that this is a very robust phenomenon .",
    "is it robust enough to extend to qcd ?",
    "there it would support the idea that glueball - quarkonium mixing should be suppressed and that we should search experimentally for glueballs at the masses found in the corresponding pure gauge theory .",
    "these are important questions but we need some understanding of the underlying dynamics if we are to move beyond the realm of conjecture .",
    "in addition to the above two topics , we also clarified the unusually strong finite - volume effects that we saw in our previous work .",
    "it turns out that these are operator artefacts .",
    "in fact , the true bound states show weak finite volume effects . however , if one uses smeared operators it is difficult to avoid components that are essentially ( smeared ) polyakov loops .",
    "these components introduce the torelon into the measured spectrum and , of course , the mass of this varies rapidly with volume .",
    "this is a generic problem when one has a theory with fundamental charges , and the simplest way to deal with it is to include smeared torelon operators in the operator basis .",
    "after diagonalisation one can explicitly determine which states have dominant torelon components .",
    "finally we point to the dense spectrum of states we have found in the higgs phase at large scalar coupling .",
    "this is in a phase without confinement , and presumably the dynamics is not being driven by the gauge coupling becoming large at large distances .",
    "it is therefore tempting to conclude that what we have here is a generic example of a spectrum produced by a strong scalar self - coupling .",
    "we conclude with a brief comment as to how these calculations need to be improved .",
    "the most obvious lacuna concerns multiparticle scattering states . we have not attempted to identify these , except in the very obvious case of the higgs phase at small scalar self - coupling .",
    "there is some evidence that our operators , which are naively designed to project only onto single particle states , usually do so .",
    "however , this really needs to be checked explicitly , especially in the strong - coupling higgs phase where , if it turns out not to be the case , it could completely alter our interpretation of the spectrum .",
    "the inclusion of scattering states is also necessary if we are to perform a proper analysis of flux tube decay through the crossover region .",
    "technically the problem is simple .",
    "for example , suppose @xmath99 is an operator that has a very good projection onto the lightest scalar with momentum @xmath100 ( which will be one of the discrete set of allowed momenta in our finite volume ) . then the operator @xmath101 ( vacuum subtracted if necessary ) will be a good operator for the two - scalar scattering state of zero total momentum and finite relative momentum .",
    "at least this will be so for volumes that are not too small .",
    "in similar ways one can build other trial multiparticle operators and add them to the operator basis .",
    "however , to be confident that one is correctly isolating multiparticle states one needs to do an accurate finite volume analysis that shows the continuum cut gradually forming as one increases the volume .",
    "this would be a substantially larger calculation than the one in this paper .",
    "it would also be very interesting to further pursue the scalar - glue decoupling ; in particular to see if it might be related to the ozi rule in qcd .",
    "these calculations were performed on the cray j90 at ral under pparc grants gr / j86605 and gr / k9533 .",
