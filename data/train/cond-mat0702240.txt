    "cluster formation in complex fluids is a topic that has attracted considerable attention recently.@xcite the general belief is that a short - range attraction in the pair interaction potential is necessary to initiate aggregation and a long - range repulsive tail in order to limit cluster growth and prevent phase separation .",
    "an alternative scenario for cluster formation pertains to systems whose constituent particles interact by means of purely repulsive potentials .",
    "cluster formation in this case is counterintuitive at first sight : why should particles form clusters if there is no attraction acting between them ?",
    "the answer lies in an additional property of the effective repulsion , namely that of being _ bounded _ , thus allowing full particle overlaps .",
    "though surprising and seemingly unphysical at first , bounded interactions are fully legitimate and natural as effective potentials@xcite between polymeric macromolecular aggregates of low internal monomer concentration , such as polymers,@xcite dendrimers,@xcite microgels,@xcite or coarse - grained block copolymers.@xcite the growing interest in this type of effective interactions is also underlined by the recent mathematical proof of the existence of crystalline ground states for such systems.@xcite    cluster formation in the fluid _ and _ in the crystal phases was explicitly seen in the system of penetrable spheres , following early simulation results@xcite and subsequent cell - model calculations.@xcite cluster formation was attributed there to the tendency of particles to create free space by forming full overlaps .",
    "the conditions under which ultrasoft and purely repulsive particles form clusters have been conjectured a few years ago@xcite and explicitly confirmed by computer simulation very recently.@xcite the key lies in the behavior of the fourier transform of the effective interaction potential : for clusters to form , it must contain negative parts , forming thus the class of @xmath1-interactions .",
    "the complementary class of potentials with purely nonnegative fourier transforms , @xmath2 , does not lead to clustering but to remelting at high densities.@xcite an intriguing feature of the crystals formed by @xmath1-systems is the independence of the lattice constant on density,@xcite a feature that reflects the flexibility of soft matter systems in achieving forms of self - organization unknown to atomic ones.@xcite the same characteristic has recently been seen also in slightly modified models that contain a short - range hard core.@xcite in this work , we provide an analytical solution of the crystallization problem and of the properties of the ensuing solids within the framework of an accurate density functional approach .",
    "we explicitly demonstrate the persistence of a single length scale at all densities and for all members of the @xmath1-class and offer thus broad physical insight into the mechanisms driving the stability of the clustered crystals .",
    "we further establish some universal structural properties of all @xmath1-systems both in the fluid and in the solid state , justifying the use of the mean - field density functional on which this work rests .",

    "( [ oz : eq ] ) , are fulfilled . in the mfa , it is a priori assumed that @xmath86 , which is introduced into the ornstein - zernike relation and thus @xmath31 is determined .",

    "note also that discrepancies at small @xmath8-values become strongly suppressed upon taking a fourier transform , due to the additional geometrical @xmath117-factor involved in the three - dimensional integration .",
    "it can therefore be seen that the mfa and the hnc are closely related to one another : the hnc is so successful due to the strong mean - field character of the systems under consideration .",
    "this fact has also been established and extensively discussed for the case of the gaussian model,@xcite i.e. , the @xmath118 member of the gem-@xmath17 class .",
