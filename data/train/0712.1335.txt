    "geometrical dynamics is dynamics of elementary particles , generated by the space - time geometry . in the space - time of minkowski",
    "the geometrical dynamics coincides with the conventional classical dynamics , and the geometrical dynamics may be considered to be a generalization of classical dynamics onto more general space - time geometries . however , the geometric dynamics has a more fundamental basis , and it may be defined in multivariant space - time geometries , where one can not introduce the conventional classical dynamics .",
    "the fact is that , the classical dynamics has been introduced for the space - time geometry with unlimited divisibility , whereas the real space - time has a limited divisibility .",
    "the limited divisibility of the space - time is of no importance for dynamics of macroscopic bodies .",
    "however , when the size of moving bodies is of the order of the size of heterogeneity , one may not neglect the limited divisibility of the space - time geometry .",
    "the geometric dynamics is developed in the framework of the program of the further physics geometrization , declared in @xcite .",
    "the special relativity and the general relativity are steps in the development of this program .",
    "necessity on the further development appeared in the thirtieth of the twentieth century , when diffraction of electrons has been discovered .",
    "the motion of electrons , passing through the slit , is multivariant .",
    "as far as the free electron motion depends only on the properties of the space - time , one needed to change the space - time geometry , making it to be multivariant . in multivariant geometry at the point @xmath4",
    "there are many vectors @xmath3 , @xmath5 , ... , which are equal to the given vector @xmath1 at the point @xmath0 , but they are not equal between themselves . such a space - time geometry was not known in the beginning of the twentieth century .",
    "it is impossible in the framework of the riemannian geometry . as a result",
    "the multivariance was prescribed to dynamics .",
    "dynamic variables were replaced by matrices and operators .",
    "one obtains the quantum dynamics , which differs from the classical dynamics in its principles .",
    "multivariant space - time geometry appeared only in the end of the twentieth century @xcite .",
    "the further geometrization of physics became to be possible .",
    "any geometry is constructed as a modification of the proper euclidean geometry .",
    "but not all representations of the proper euclidean geometry are convenient for modification .",
    "there are three representation of the proper euclidean geometry @xcite .",
    "they differ in the number of primary ( basic ) elements , forming the euclidean geometry .",
    "the euclidean representation ( e - representation ) contains three basic elements ( point , segment , angle ) .",
    "any geometrical object ( figure ) can be constructed of these basic elements .",
    "properties of the basic elements and the method of their application are described by the euclidean axioms .",
    "the vector representation ( v - representation ) of the proper euclidean geometry contains two basic elements ( point , vector ) .",
    "the angle is a derivative element , which is constructed of two vectors .",
    "a use of the two basic elements at the construction of geometrical objects is determined by the special structure , known as the linear vector space with the scalar product , given on it ( euclidean space ) .",
    "the scalar product of linear vector space describes interrelation of two basic elements ( vectors ) , whereas other properties of the linear vector space associate with the displacement of vectors .",
    "the third representation ( @xmath6-representation ) of the proper euclidean geometry contains only one basic element ( point ) .",
    "segment ( vector ) is a derivative element .",
    "it is constructed of points .",
    "the angle is also a derivative element .",
    "it is constructed of two segments ( vectors ) .",
    "the @xmath7-representation contains a special structure : world function @xmath6 , which describes interrelation of two basic elements ( points ) .",
    "the world function @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the distance between points @xmath0 and @xmath10 .",
    "the concept of distance @xmath11 , as well as the world function @xmath6 , is used in all representations of the proper euclidean geometry .",
    "however , the world function forms a structure only in the @xmath6-representation , where the world function @xmath6 describes interrelation of two basic elements ( points ) .",
    "besides , the world function of the proper euclidean geometry satisfies a series of constraints , formulated in terms of @xmath6 and only in terms of @xmath6 .",
    "these conditions ( the euclideaness conditions ) will be formulated below .",
    "the euclideaness conditions are equivalent to a use of the vector linear space with the scalar product on it , but formally they do not mention the linear vector space , because all concepts of the linear vector space , as well as all concepts of the proper euclidean geometry are expressed directly via world function @xmath6 and only via it .",
    "if we want to modify the proper euclidean geometry , then we should use the @xmath6-representation for its modification . in the @xmath6-representation the special geometric structure ( world function )",
    "has the form of a function of two points . modifying the form of the world function",
    ", we automatically modify all concepts of the proper euclidean geometry , which are expressed via the world function .",
    "it is very important , that the expression of geometrical concepts via the world function does not refer to the means of description ( dimension , coordinate system , concept of a curve ) .",
    "the fact , that modifying the world function , one violates the euclideaness conditions , is of no importance , because one obtains non - euclidean geometry as a result of such a modification .",
    "a change of the world function means a change of the distance , which is interpreted as a deformation of the proper euclidean geometry .",
    "the generalized geometry , obtained by a deformation of the proper euclidean geometry is called the tubular geometry ( t - geometry ) , because in the generalized geometry straight lines are tubes ( surfaces ) , in general , but not one - dimensional lines .",
    "another name of t - geometry is the physical geometry .",
    "the physical geometry is the geometry , described completely by the world function .",
    "any physical geometry may be used as a space - time geometry in the sense , that the set of all t - geometries is the set of all possible space - time geometries .",
    "modification of the proper euclidean geometry in v - representation is very restricted , because in this representation there are two basic elements .",
    "they are not independent , and one can not modify them independently .",
    "formally it means , that the linear vector space is to be preserved as a geometrical structure .",
    "it means , in particular , that the generalized geometry retains to be continuous , uniform and isotropic .",
    "the dimension of the generalized geometry is to be fixed . besides",
    ", the generalized geometry can not be multivariant .",
    "such a property of the space - time geometry as multivariance can be obtained only in @xmath6-representation .",
    "as far as the @xmath6-representation of the proper euclidean geometry was not known in the twentieth century , the multivariance of geometry was also unknown concept .",
    "transition from the v - representation to @xmath6-representation is carried out as follows .",
    "all concepts of the linear vector space are expressed in terms of the world function @xmath6 . in reality ,",
    "concepts of vector , scalar product of two vectors and linear dependence of @xmath12 vectors are expressed via the world function @xmath13 of the proper euclidean geometry .",
    "such operations under vectors as equality of vectors , summation of vectors and multiplication of a vector by a real number are expressed by means of some formulae .",
    "the characteristic properties of these operations , which are given in v - representation by means of axioms , are given now by special properties of the euclidean world function @xmath13 .",
    "after expression of the linear vector space via the world function the linear vector space may be not mentioned , because all its properties are described by the world function .",
    "we obtain the @xmath6-representation of the proper euclidean geometry , where some properties of the linear vector space are expressed in the form of formulae , whereas another part of properties is hidden in the specific form of the euclidean world function @xmath13 . modifying world function , we modify automatically the properties of the linear vector space ( which is not mentioned in fact ) . at such a modification",
    "we are not to think about the way of modification of the linear vector space , which is the principal geometrical structure in the v - representation . in the @xmath6-representation the linear vector space is a derivative structure , which may be not mention at all .",
    "thus , at transition to @xmath6-representation the concepts of the linear vector space ( primary concepts in v - representation ) become to be secondary concepts ( derivative concepts of the @xmath6-representation ) .    in @xmath6-representation",
    "we have the following expressions for concepts of the proper euclidean geometry .",

    "( one can verify this easily ) .",
    "the relations ( [ a1.1 ] ) , ( [ a1.7b ] ) do not contain a reference to the dimension of the euclidean space and to a coordinate system in it .",
    "hence , the relations ( [ a1.1 ] ) , ( [ a1.7b ] ) are general geometric relations , which may be considered as a definition of the scalar product of two vectors and that of the linear dependence of vectors .",

    "number of solutions depends on the form of the world function @xmath6 .",
    "this fact means a multivariance of the property of two vectors equivalence in the arbitrary t - geometry . in other words ,",
    "the single - variance of the vector equality in the proper euclidean space is a specific property of the proper euclidean geometry , and this property is conditioned by the form of the euclidean world function . in other t - geometries",
    "this property does not take place , in general .",
    "the multivariance is a general property of a physical geometry .",
    "it is connected with a necessity of solution of algebraic equations , containing the world function .",
    "as far as the world function is different in different physical geometries , the solution of these equations may be not unique , or it may not exist at all .",
    "if there are many solutions of equations ( [ a1.5 ] ) , ( [ a1.6 ] ) at fixed vector @xmath1 and fixed point @xmath4 , we shall speak on the property of multivariance of the physical geometry . if there is no solution of equations ( [ a1.5 ] ) , ( a1.6 ) at fixed vector @xmath1 and fixed point @xmath35 , we shall speak , that the physical geometry has the property of discrimination ( zero - variance ) .",

    "if the relations@xmath100@xmath101are satisfied , the relations@xmath102are not satisfied , in general , because the relations ( [ a6.11 ] ) contain the scalar products @xmath103 .",

    "the world chain @xmath87 , consisting of equivalent links ( [ a6.1 ] ) , ( [ a6.2 ] ) , describes a free motion of a physical body ( particle ) , associated with the skeleton @xmath62 .",
    "we assume that _ the motion of a physical body is free , if all points of the body move free _ ( i.e. without acceleration ) . if the external forces are absent , the physical body as a whole moves without acceleration .",
    "however , if the body rotates , one may not consider the motion of this body as a free motion , because not all points of this body move free ( without acceleration ) . in the rotating body",
    "there are internal forces , which generate centripetal acceleration to some points of the body . as a result",
    "some points of the body do not move free .",
    "motion of the rotating body may be free only on the average , but not exactly free .",
    "conception of non - free motion of a particle is rather indefinite , and we restrict ourselves only with consideration of a free motion .",
    "conventional conception of the motion of extensive ( non - pointlike ) particle , which is free on the average , contains a free displacement , described by the velocity 4-vector , and a spatial rotation , described by the angular velocity 3-pseudovector @xmath105 .",
    "the velocity 4-vector is associated with the timelike leading vector @xmath1 . at the free on the average motion of a rotating body some of vectors @xmath106 ... of the skeleton @xmath62 are not in parallel with vectors @xmath107 , although at the free motion all vectors @xmath108 are to be in parallel with @xmath107 as it follows from ( [ a6.1 ] ) .",
    "it means that the world chain @xmath87 of a freely moving body can describe only translation of a physical body , but not its rotation .",
    "if the leading vector @xmath1 is spacelike , the body , described by the skeleton @xmath62 , evolves in the spacelike direction .",
    "it seems , that the spacelike evolution is prohibited .",
    "but it is not so .",
    "if the world chain forms a helix with the timelike axis , such a world chain may be considered as timelike on the average . in reality",
    "such world chains are possible .",
    "for instance , the world chain of the classical dirac particle is a helix with timelike axis @xcite .",
    "it is not quite clear , whether or not the links of this chain are spacelike , because internal degrees of freedom of the dirac particle , responsible for helicity of the world chain , are described nonrelativistically .",
    "thus , consideration of a spatial evolution is not meaningless , especially if we take into account , that the spatial evolution may imitate rotation , which is absent at the free motion of a particle .",
    "let us consider the flat homogeneous isotropic space - time @xmath109 , described by the world function @xmath110@xmath111where @xmath112 is the world function of the @xmath113-dimensional space - time of minkowski .",
    "@xmath114 is some elementary length .",
    "in such a space - time geometry two connected equivalent timelike vectors @xmath1 and @xmath115 are described as follows @xcite @xmath116where @xmath117 is an arbitrary unit 3-vector ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath119 is the length of the vector @xmath1 ( geometrical mass , associated with the particle , which is described by the vector @xmath1 ) .",
    "we see that the spatial part of the vector @xmath115 is determined to within the arbitrary 3-vector of the length @xmath120 .",
    "this multivariance generates wobbling of the links of the world chain , consisting of equivalent timelike vectors @xmath121 , @xmath115 , @xmath122 , ... statistical description of the chain with wobbling links coincides with the quantum description of the particle with the mass @xmath123 , if the elementary length @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the speed of the light , @xmath126 is the quantum constant , and @xmath127 is some universal constant , whose exact value is not determined @xcite , because the statistical description does not contain the quantity @xmath127 .",
    "thus , the characteristic wobbling length is of the order of @xmath114 .",
    "thus , to explain the quantum description of the particle motion as a statistical description of the multivariant classical motion , we should use the world function ( [ a4.0 ] ) .",

    "we have @xmath147where @xmath148 is an arbitrary unit 3-vector .",
    "the multivariance vector @xmath138 is spacelike    in the case , when @xmath149 , corresponding wobbling length @xmath150where @xmath151 is the compton wave length of electron .",
    "the relation ( [ a4.3 ] ) means that @xmath152for other values @xmath153 the form of the world function @xmath154 may distinguish from the relation ( [ a4.4 ] ) .",

    "it means that in the space - time there are no close points .",
    "absence of close points on the continual set of points seems rather unexpected , because the space - time discreteness associates usually with a latticed space - time , but not with a continual space - time .",
    "nevertheless , the fact of absence of close points means a discreteness of the space - time , and we see no other interpretation , than discreteness . if we consider equivalence of two vectors @xmath1 and @xmath3 in some latticed space , we should expect a discrimination in some cases , because due to latticed character of the space one can not always find at the point @xmath0 a vector @xmath1 , which is equivalent to a given vector @xmath3 .",

    "thus , the case @xmath205 corresponds to the completely discrete geometry .",
    "it is reasonable to consider the case of finite @xmath206 as the case of partly discrete geometry . in this case",
    "the quantity @xmath207 may be considered as a degree of discreteness of the space - time geometry .    in general , the concept of partly discrete geometry is not conventional .",
    "but it is absent in the conventional approach , because the conception of a discrete geometry is not developed properly .",
    "however , it appears that one can introduce such a continuous parameter @xmath186 , that at @xmath208 we have a continuous space - time geometry ( geometry of minkowski ) , and at @xmath209 we have a completely discrete geometry .",
    "investigating the space - time geometry with arbitrary @xmath186 , we use general methods of t - geometry investigation .",
    "in such a situation it seems to be reasonable to introduce the concept of partly discrete geometry with the discreteness scale @xmath210 and the discreteness degree @xmath186 .    in the partly discrete multivariant geometry",
    "there are constraints on possible mass of a particle even in the case , when the discreteness is not complete .",
    "the discreteness of the space - time geometry is connected with the capacity of discrimination , generated by the fact of zero - variance , when the equations ( [ a1.5 ] ) , ( [ a1.6 ] ) , describing equivalence of two vectors , have no solution .",
    "zero - variance and multivariance are two sides of one coin .",
    "multivariance generates quantum effects , whereas the zero - variance generates discrete character of properties of elementary particles .",
    "quantum effects are generated by large values of the world function ( @xmath211 ) , whereas zero - variance and discreteness are generated by small values of the world function ( @xmath212 ) .",
    "substituting ( [ a4.20 ] ) in ( [ a4.8 ] ) , we obtain@xmath213@xmath214",
    "consideration of t - geometry as a space - time geometry admits one to obtain dynamics of a particle as corollary of the geometrical object structure .",
    "evolution of the geometrical object in the space - time is determined by the skeleton @xmath215 of the geometrical object and by fixing of the leading vector @xmath1 .",
    "the skeleton and the leading vector determine the world chain , which describes the evolution completely .",
    "the world chain may be wobbling , it is a manifestation of the space - time geometry multivariance .",
    "quantum effects are only one of manifestations of the multivariance .",
    "it is remarkable , that for determination of the world chain one does not need differential equations , which may be used only in the space - time manifold .",
    "one does not need space - time continuity ( continual geometry ) .",
    "of course , one may introduce the continual coordinate system and write dynamic differential equation there .",
    "one may , but it is not necessary . in general ,",
    "geometrical dynamics ( i.e. dynamics generated by the space - time geometry ) is a discrete dynamics , where step of evolution is determined by the length of the leading vector .",
    "it is possible , that one will need a development of special mathematical technique for an effective use of the geometrical dynamics .",
    "the real space - time geometry contains the quantum constant @xmath126 as a parameter . as a result",
    "the geometric dynamics explains freely quantum effects , but not only them .",
    "the particle mass is geometrized ( the particle mass is simply a length of some vector ) . as a result",
    "the problem of mass of elementary particles is simply a geometrical problem .",
    "it is a problem of the structure of elementary geometrical object and its evolution .",
    "one needs simply to investigate different forms of skeletons of simplest geometrical objects . besides , the space - time geometry , looking as a continuous geometry , appears to be partly discrete .",
    "these discreteness of `` continual '' space - time geometry is a source of a discrete character of the elementary particle properties . in turn t - geometry ( new conception of geometry )",
    "is a source of multivariance and of the discrimination capacity ( zero - variance ) , which are responsible for quantum effects and the discrete character of the elementary particles properties ."
