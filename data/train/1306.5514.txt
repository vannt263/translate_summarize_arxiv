    "collisions of light heavy - ions constitute one of the most interesting areas of low - energy nuclear physics . scattering of light systems seems to reveal the internal structure of the colliding nuclei as well as the structure of the composite system in a profound way .",
    "one of the manifestations of this interplay between structure and reactions is the observation of regular energy - dependent structures in most scattering cross - sections for collision energies above the coulomb barrier  @xcite . in conjunction with reaction theory ,",
    "clustering models  @xcite , mean - field studies of shape isomeric resonances and molecular formations  @xcite , and adiabatic time - dependent hartree - fock calculations  @xcite of fusion barriers have been some of the microscopic approaches used to study phenomena associated with light systems .",
    "structures in fusion cross - sections are possible experimental signatures of nuclear molecules  @xcite .",
    "however , structures in fusion excitation functions may also appear in light systems which are not necessarily due to the formation of nuclear molecules .",
    "such structures or oscillations appear clearly in cross - sections for the fusion of @xmath2c+@xmath2c  @xcite , @xmath2c+@xmath0o  @xcite , @xmath0o+@xmath0o  @xcite , and @xmath3ne+@xmath3ne  @xcite . in particular , the discrete nature of angular momentum may reveal itself in fusion excitation functions as peaks associated with barriers for specific angular momenta  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the intriguing aspects mentioned above , sub - barrier fusion cross - sections of light systems also carry a significance for astrophysical applications  @xcite .",
    "this need for fusion cross - sections at extreme sub coulomb barrier energies have led to the discussion of fusion hindrance for such systems  @xcite .",
    "recently , esbensen has provided a comprehensive coupled - channels study of the @xmath0o+@xmath0o fusion for the full energy regime  @xcite . since most of the data  @xcite for the @xmath0o+@xmath0o system are more than a quarter of a century old ,",
    "theoretical studies have been the main tool of recent investigations . as we will discuss below , large variations in the available fusion data at above - barrier energies",
    "have made such studies more difficult .",
    "it is generally acknowledged that the tdhf method provides a useful foundation for a fully microscopic many - body theory of low - energy heavy - ion reactions  @xcite .",
    "this assumption is predicated in part on the results of fusion excitation calculations for light - mass systems and particular energy - angle correlation - function calculations for strongly damped heavy - mass collisions .",
    "fusion of @xmath0o+@xmath0o at above barrier energies was one of the primary testing systems for early tdhf calculations  @xcite , primarily because @xmath0o is doubly magic and light systems were easier for computational reasons .",
    "the initial results showed reasonable agreement with higher energy ( around @xmath4  mev ) fusion data .",
    "however , this was mostly the result of the so - called `` fusion window anomaly '' , a non - zero lower angular momentum limit for fusion due to an unusual degree of transparency for central collisions .",
    "this central deep - inelastic region was not seen experimentally .",
    "later it was shown that this was primarily due to an approximation made in the effective interaction , the absence of the spin - orbit term  @xcite . in these older tdhf calculations ,",
    "axial symmetry was mostly assumed and lower order discretization techniques were used for numerical implementation .",
    "non - central impact parameters were often treated via the `` rotating frame approximation ''  @xcite . today , most tdhf codes employ higher order interpolation methods and operate on a fully three - dimensional lattice with no unphysical symmetry assumptions  @xcite . naturally , three - dimensional calculations show a higher degree of dissipation in comparison to the two - dimensional counterparts due to an increased number of degrees - of - freedom sharing the available energy .",
    "in fact , modern tdhf calculations of fusion reactions have reached a good level of description both for light systems @xcite and heavy systems where fusion hindrance is expected  @xcite .",
    "predictions of reaction dynamics in actinide collisions have also been made recently  @xcite .",
    "almost all tdhf calculations have been done using the skyrme energy density functional ( edf )  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the omission of the spin - orbit term , earlier tdhf calculations also replaced some of the numerically difficult terms in the skyrme interaction with a finite - range yukawa form  @xcite , without a new fit to the nuclear properties .",
    "modern skyrme forces have much improved fit properties to nuclear data that significantly reduce the variations among them for reproducing global nuclear properties  @xcite .",
    "finally , it is well known  @xcite that the skyrme energy density functional also contains time - odd terms which depend on the spin density , spin kinetic energy density , and the full spin - current pseudotensor .",
    "the time - odd terms vanish for static calculations of even - even nuclei but they should be present for time - dependent calculations to maintain the galilean invariance of the collision process  @xcite .",
    "the skyrme energy density functional does remain time - reversal invariant as all the time - odd terms enter in quadratic form or as linear byproducts .",
    "many of these terms have not been included in older tdhf calculations because of numerical difficulty .",
    "the latest generation of tdhf codes  @xcite used in this study contain all of these time - odd terms .",
    "fusion at sub - barrier energies is a very challenging problem for nuclear theory . in particular",
    ", it may be extremely sensitive to the internal structure of the collision partners , such as their low - lying collective modes @xcite . currently , there is no implementation based on a true quantum many - body theory of barrier tunneling . in all sub - barrier fusion calculations",
    "one assumes the existence of an ion - ion potential @xmath5 which depends on the internuclear distance @xmath6 .",
    "while phenomenological heavy - ion potentials ( e.g. , woods - saxon or double - folding ) provide a useful starting point for the analysis of fusion data , it is desirable to use a quantum many - body approach which properly describes the underlying nuclear shell structure of the reaction system . during the past several years",
    ", we have developed the density constrained time - dependent hartree - fock ( dc - tdhf ) method for calculating heavy - ion potentials @xmath5  @xcite which incorporate all of the dynamical entrance channel effects such as neck formation , particle exchange , internal excitations , and deformation effects  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we carry out tdhf calculations of fusion cross - sections for the @xmath0o+@xmath0o system without making any of the approximations used in earlier calculations . in the next section",
    "we discuss the experimental fusion data .",
    "this is followed by above barrier fusion calculations directly using tdhf .",
    "transfer channels and inelastic excitation of octupole states are then discussed .",
    "finally , both sub - barrier and above the barrier fusion cross - sections are calculated using the dc - tdhf approach of obtaining potential barriers from the tdhf time - evolution .",
    "during the late 1970s and early 1980s the observed structures in fusion excitation functions for light-@xmath7 systems prompted a flurry of experiments measuring fusion cross - sections for these systems  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows a selected set of experimental fusion cross - sections for the @xmath0o+@xmath0o system .",
    "the cross - section at higher energies is characterized by broad energy - dependent oscillations .",
    "o+@xmath0o fusion excitation functions plotted on a linear scale.,width=325 ]    unlike heavy mass systems , for the collisions of light nuclei at bombarding energies well above the coulomb barrier the thermalization of the available energy is much slower thus resulting in collective excitations of the composite system with a large number of break - up channels .",
    "consequently , the de - excitation mechanism of the compound system is primarily through the emission of light-@xmath7 products as opposed to emission of primary @xmath8-rays .",
    "the fission mode is assumed to be negligible for light systems .",
    "broadly , the experimental approach to measuring above barrier fusion cross - sections for light mass systems falls into three categories .",
    "the first method involves the detection of particle yields originating from fusion products and is the method used in the earliest experiments  @xcite , the second method relies on the detection of the de - excitation @xmath8-rays from nuclides produced as evaporation residues ( with kolata _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite detecting @xmath9 nuclides ) , and the last method uses a time - of - flight technique to identify evaporation residues ( with fernandez _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite detecting fragments with @xmath10 ) .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite use both the time - of - flight technique and a @xmath11 telescope to identify all products with @xmath12 or @xmath10 as evaporation residue .",
    "each one of these methods has its advantages and disadvantages .",
    "in addition to their dependence on the detection system and associated corrections , techniques to identify @xmath8-rays from evaporation residue fail to account for transitions to the ground - state and residues formed without @xmath8 emission .",
    "moreover , high - energy @xmath8 rays can not be used to identify nuclei .",
    "the barrier top and sub - barrier fusion data of wu and barnes  @xcite and thomas and coworkers  @xcite are consistent with each other . in these two experiments a lot of attention was paid to degradation ( evaporation ) of the target by using gold plated targets and cross - checking the target thickness with rutherford coulomb back - scattering measurements . among the higher energy experiments ,",
    "fernandez _ et al .",
    "_ use elastic scattering measurements at the beginning and end of an experimental run to assure that target thicknesses have not changed .",
    "changing thickness may result in a change in normalization of the cross - sections .",
    "unfortunately , their data do not extend to lower energies to compare with the lower energy data .",
    "wu and barnes undertake a comparison of their results with other experiments at @xmath13  mev and argue that if kolata _",
    "data at this energy are corrected by their summing and branching ratio factor the two results are in much closer agreement ( @xmath14 versus @xmath15  mb ) .",
    "somewhat smaller differences have been found by kuronen _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , who have measured the fusion cross - sections between @xmath16 and @xmath17  mev and compared their results with the wu and barnes and the thomas data and some of the older data .",
    "resolution of these differences at all energies is highly desirable .",
    "in this section we present results for @xmath0o+@xmath0o fusion by directly using the tdhf3d code  @xcite at energies above the coulomb barrier .",

    "[ fig : csoo ] with a dashed line .",
    "the sharp increases of the fusion cross - sections at the positions of the angular momentum dependent barriers @xmath32 are due to the fact that fusion penetration probabilities are either 0 or 1 at the tdhf level .",
    "the sharp edges observed in fig .  [ fig : csoo ] can be smoothed by considering tunneling in an approximate way . as a first approximation",
    ", one can estimate the barrier penetration probability according to the hill - wheeler formula  @xcite with a fermi function : @xmath36 with @xmath37/\\varepsilon$ ] . choosing the decay constant @xmath38  @xcite , one gets the fusion cross - sections represented by the solid line in fig .",

    "@xcite by @xmath39 is obtained .",
    "it is interesting to note that the same factor was obtained for the @xmath0o+@xmath40pb system , while the predicted position of the barrier is in excellent agreement with experiment  @xcite .",
    "note that this systematic discrepancy remains small , in particular given the fact that the tdhf calculations have no input coming from reaction mechanisms .",
    "oscillations for @xmath41  mev are clearly visible and due to @xmath1-dependent barriers with @xmath42 .",
    "note that these oscillations would be less visible for asymmetric systems because all integer values of @xmath1 are possible .",
    "in addition , the observation of these oscillations is limited to light systems up to , e.g. , @xmath43si+@xmath43si  @xcite . for heavier systems , the oscillations are indeed expected to be smeared out as the coupling to many reaction channels sets in  @xcite .      in order to get a deeper insight into the dynamical mechanisms at play in the fusion process",
    ", the tdhf approach can also be used to estimate the importance of other channels around the barrier .",
    "let us first investigate the particle transfer at sub - barrier energies .",
    "indeed , transfer channels could be a doorway to dissipation and , then , reduce the fusion probability  @xcite .",
    "the tdhf approach has been used to investigate quasi - elastic transfer reactions in heavy - ion collisions in recent works  @xcite .",
    "the proton and neutron transfer probabilities have been computed in @xmath0o+@xmath0o at @xmath44 mev , i.e. , just below the barrier , using the particle number projection technique developed in ref .",
    "the resulting probabilities are extremely small , i.e. , @xmath45 which is at the level of the numerical noise .",
    "these results have been confirmed in beyond tdhf calculations where fluctuations at the time - dependent random - phase approximation ( tdrpa ) level are included ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for details of the technique ) .",
    "the fact that the transfer probabilities are so small in this reaction is essentially due to the large negative @xmath46values for these channels .",
    "note that the single - particle wave - functions belonging initially to one nucleus can still be partially transferred to the other fragment  @xcite .",
    "however , this process , being symmetric , does not change the fragment particle number distributions . only transfer to a single - particle state above the fermi level , which is energetically unfavored ,",
    "would induce fluctuations of the particle number probabilities in the fragments .",
    "note that in these calculations possible correlations which could enhance , e.g. , nucleon pair transfer  @xcite are neglected . beyond tdhf calculations including such correlations should be considered to treat transfer of paired nucleons  @xcite .",
    "however , pair transfer is unlikely to exceed the transfer of one independent particle .",
    "we then conclude that the sub - barrier fusion in @xmath0o+@xmath0o is not affected by transfer channels .",
    "in addition to quasi - elastic transfer , inelastic excitation of low - lying collective states are also known to strongly affect fusion around and below the barrier  @xcite .",
    "both the coupled - channel approach  @xcite and tdhf calculations have been used to study the coupling between fusion and rotational motion  @xcite and between fusion and vibrational modes  @xcite . in the present case , the coupling of the relative motion to the @xmath47 octupole phonon in @xmath0o at @xmath48  mev @xcite may induce a global shift of the barrier to lower energies  @xcite .",

    "detailed examination shows that this discrepancy is due to the earlier closing of the @xmath105 window and the total absence of the @xmath106 partial wave in the potential model calculations of the dc - tdhf formulation .    in the dc - tdhf approach only the dynamical density evolution for central collision",
    "is used in the calculation of the potential .",
    "then the cross - sections are determined using the isocentrifugal approximation .",
    "this is naturally an approximation to the full many - body calculation but seems to be a very good approximation at lower energies and allows the calculation of sub - barrier cross - sections , where only small angular momenta @xmath1 contribute . at the higher energies discussed in this paper ( up to three times the barrier height )",
    ", the fusion cross - section is determined by larger values of the critical angular momentum .",
    "the smaller potential pocket at high @xmath1 may lead to a higher sensitivity of the fusion cross - section to the details of the potential .",
    "the observed discrepancy would indicate a breakdown of the isocentrifugal approximation , meaning that the tdhf potential at high @xmath1 is not exactly the one at @xmath107 plus a centrifugal potential .",
    "naturally , direct tdhf calculations contain all of the dynamics and therefore should be more reliable at these energies .",
    "the reactions of light systems at high energies ( two to four times the barrier height ) is complicated both experimentally and theoretically due to the presence of many breakup channels and excitations .",
    "we expect the tdhf results to yield a higher fusion cross - section since many of the breakup channels are not naturally available in tdhf and they will appear as fusion .",
    "however , a closer investigation of the tdhf dynamics and the microscopically calculated excitation energy clearly indicates that a significant portion of the collective kinetic energy is not equilibrated . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we show the long - time evolution of the dc - tdhf potential @xmath5 together with the quantity @xmath108 calculated at the tdhf energy @xmath109  mev .",
    "we see that after the system traverses through the first potential minimum it starts to rise and go through successive higher minima and finally settles almost near the top of the entrance channel barrier .",
    "this is perhaps more clearly seen through the evolution of @xmath108 , which is some measure of dissipation .",
    "this behavior occurs because the excitation energy , @xmath110 , is not distributed in an irreversible fashion but a certain fraction of it seems to be reversible , going into collective modes . in a fully quantal calculation",
    "this may partially lead to a break - up channel .",
    "the situation for the collision at @xmath13  mev is very different . in this case",
    "the system settles close to the first barrier minimum .    , and the excitation energy , @xmath108 , for the head - on collision of the @xmath111 system at a collision energy of @xmath112  mev as a function of the ion - ion distance @xmath6.,width=325 ]",
    "a microscopic study of the @xmath0o+@xmath0o fusion reaction has been performed .",
    "available experimental data sets above the barrier clearly disagree with each other .",
    "calculations with the tdhf and the dc - tdhf methods are in better agreement with the data exhibiting the largest cross - sections . the oscillations of the cross - sections are interpreted as an effect of overcoming angular momentum dependent barriers .",
    "the sub - barrier cross - sections are very well reproduced by the dc - tdhf calculations .",
    "the dc - tdhf method has also been used to investigate the dissipative mechanisms .",
    "the latter rapidly set in inside the barrier , converting the kinetic energy of the relative motion into excitation energy of the fragments . in central collisions slightly above the barrier",
    "the system then settles close to the first barrier minimum .",
    "in contrast , well above the barrier the system settles near the top of the entrance channel barrier into a di - nuclear configuration , possibly leading to a break - up channel .    the effect of coupling to other channels has been studied .",
    "although the transfer reactions at sub - barrier energies are shown to be negligible , an oscillation of the octupole moment of the fragment in the exit channel indicates a coupling between the relative motion and the @xmath47 states in @xmath0o .",
    "coupled - channel calculations show that this coupling shifts the barrier to lower energy , increasing the sub - barrier fusion cross - section by about one order of magnitude .    due to its small number of constituents , and to the magic nature of the collision partners ,",
    "the @xmath0o+@xmath0o system is an ideal benchmark for low energy reaction theory .",
    "future theoretical models able to treat in a fully microscopic manner the reaction mechanisms from deep sub - barrier energies to well above the barrier should be tested on this system .",
    "however , reliable experimental data above the barrier are highly desirable .",
    "useful discussions with m. dasgupta and d. j. hinde are acknowledged .",
