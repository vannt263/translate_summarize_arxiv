    "the evolution of the parton densities at small @xmath0 is a very rich but complicated issue .",
    "the steep rise of the structure function @xmath2 at small @xmath0 is explained by the presence of a huge gluon number density .",
    "the pure dglap   evolution equations , meant to describe the evolution of the parton densities as a function of @xmath3 , are able to reproduce the rise of @xmath2 provided the input starting distributions are chosen properly .    figure  [ ccfm_variables ] shows the pattern of qcd initial - state radiation in a small-@xmath0 dis event , together with labels for the kinematics .",
    "the gluon splitting function @xmath4 is given by : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( see fig .  [ ccfm_variables ] ) is the ratio of the energy fractions of successive branchings in the gluon chain and @xmath8 is virtuality of the @xmath9-channel gluon with @xmath10 . in dglap the @xmath8 dependence of all emissions in the gluon chain are simplified by the observation that at not too small @xmath0 the dominant part to the cross section comes from the region of phase space where @xmath8 is very small .",
    "however if @xmath0 or @xmath11 becomes very small , the collinear ( small @xmath12 ) approximation of dglap may be inadequate .",
    "this region is treated by the bfkl   evolution equation , which keeps the full @xmath12 integration but approximates the gluon splitting function with the asymptotic form @xmath13    from a detailed analysis of interference effects in a gluon chain , it was found   that the proper evolution variable is the angle of the emitted gluon , and not the virtuality @xmath8 as in the dglap approximation , nor @xmath11 as in the bfkl approximation .",
    "this angular ordering resulted in the new , and more complicated , ccfm evolution  , which reproduces the bfkl and dglap approximations in the small and large @xmath0 limits respectively .",
    "the ccfm equation naturally interpolates between the two extremes .",
    "however , in ccfm the gluon splitting function contains only the singular terms in @xmath11 : @xmath14 with @xmath15 being the non - sudakov form factor to regulate the @xmath16 singularity .",
    "the non singular terms of the splitting function ( see eq.([pgg ] ) ) are not obtained within the ccfm approximation .    whereas at hera energies ( @xmath17 gev ) the total cross section of deep inelastic scattering can be reasonably well described with the dglap evolution equations ,",
    "measurements of specific features of the hadronic final state indicate clear deviations from a pure dglap scenario .    the cross section at low @xmath0 and large @xmath3 for a high @xmath18 jet in the proton direction ( a forward jet ) has been advocated as a particularly sensitive measure of small @xmath0 parton dynamics @xcite .",
    "if the forward jet has large energy ( @xmath19 ) the evolution from @xmath20 to small @xmath0 can be studied .",
    "when @xmath21 there is no room for @xmath3 evolution left and the dglap formalism predicts a rather small cross section in contrast to the bfkl / ccfm formalisms , which describe the evolution also in @xmath0 .",
    "measurements performed at hera  @xcite show that the prediction from the naive dglap formalism lies a factor @xmath22 below the data , whereas the data can be described by ccfm evolution equations  @xcite .",
    "the effect of new small @xmath0 parton dynamics is most clearly seen if the contribution from typical dglap dynamics is suppressed .",
    "the forward jet production in deep inelastic scattering at small values of @xmath0 is one example of such a process .",
    "however , the kinematics need to be investigated further .",
    "typical event selection criteria at hera are :    [ cols= \" < \" , ]     the range in @xmath0 is typically @xmath23 .",
    "the evolution takes place from the large @xmath20 down to the small @xmath0 with a typical range at hera energies of @xmath24 . in order to justify the use of an evolution equation ( instead of a fixed order calculation ) one would require at least 2 or more gluon emissions during the evolution . to roughly estimate the energy fractions @xmath25 of 3 gluon emissions between @xmath26 , one can assume that each gluon carries the same energy .",
    "then the range of @xmath27 results in @xmath28 , which is far from being in the very small @xmath11 region , where the bfkl or ccfm approximations ( treating only the @xmath16 terms in the gluon splitting function ) are expected to be appropriate . in fig .",
    "[ zval_fjet_hera ] we show the values of the splitting variable @xmath11 in events satisfying the forward jet criteria at hera energies obtained from the monte carlo generator  @xcite . since the values of the splitting variable @xmath11 are indeed in the large @xmath11 region ( the majority has @xmath29 ) , it is questionable , whether the bfkl or ccfm evolution equations , including only the @xmath16 terms of the gluon splitting function , are already applicable . whereas the measurement at hera stops at @xmath30 , the available phase space at thera is enlarged by a factor of @xmath31 .",
    "therefore the gluons along the chain will presumably have smaller @xmath11 values and the usage of the small @xmath0 evolution equations might be more justified .    in fig .",
    "[ zval_fjet_thera ] we show the @xmath11 values obtained from events satisfying the forward jet selection criteria at thera energies ( @xmath32  gev ) compared with the ones at hera energies ( @xmath33  gev ) .",
    "the four plots correspond to different cuts on the minimum jet angle ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "one clearly can observe , that the distribution of @xmath11 values becomes flat at small @xmath11 at thera energies and that the small @xmath11 values are no longer suppressed as in the hera kinematic region .",
    "this clearly shows , that the application of small @xmath0 evolution equations at thera energies are justified and unavoidable , although the sensitivity to the treatment of large @xmath11 splittings does not completely go away .    at hera",
    "the forward jet cross section could be reasonably well described by including a resolved virtual photon contribution , because the phase space for small @xmath11 emissions at hera energies was relatively small .",
    "the situation changes at thera energies : the phase space for small @xmath11 emissions is larger and effects from small @xmath0 evolution become more visible . in fig .",
    "[ fig - fwdjet1 ] the cross section for forward jet production is shown as a function of @xmath0 for standard dglap prediction ( dotted ) , including in addition a contribution from resolved virtual photons ( dashed - dotted ) and the ccfm prediction ( dashed ) .",
    "for comparison the prediction from ariadne@xcite is shown , which implements a semi - classical soft radiation model in a dipole cascade , and which currently gives the best overall description of small-@xmath0 hera data .",
    "since the the available phase space at thera is enlarged by a factor of @xmath31 , the difference between the standard dglap - based calculation and the ccfm calculation is increased . moreover , at thera the ccfm approach predicts a larger cross section than the model with resolved virtual photon contributions added , and smaller cross section than ariadne , while all three models give comparable results at hera .",
    "this gives a unique opportunity , not only to distinguish between the different approaches , but also to study details of the qcd cascade in a regime , where the new small-@xmath0 evolution equations should be appropriate .    in fig .",
    "[ fig - fwdjet2 ] the forward jet cross section is shown for different minimal jet angle cuts .",
    "on the experimental side this requires complete acceptance both in the electron and proton direction down to the lowest possible angles . from the size of the cross section",
    "@xmath35 one would like to reach at least @xmath36 for the forward jet measurement , but there are other reasons to ask even for @xmath37 . on the other hand ,",
    "the luminosities needed for such measurements are moderate so that this question can be settled within one year of running at thera .",
    "hera has conclusively shown the need to go beyond the standard dglap evolution equations in order to explain the data on small-@xmath0 final states .",
    "the reach in @xmath0 is , however , not quite enough to really study details of the small-@xmath0 evolution to be able to distinguish between different approaches , such as the ccfm evolution , resolved virtual photons and the dipole cascade model . with the increased kinematical region available at thera",
    ", this will become possible . the steeply rising cross section as @xmath0 gets smaller means that such measurements can be done even with moderate luminosity . on the other hand the demands on the forward coverage of the detector",
    "is more critical  ideally it should be possible to measure jets down to an angle of @xmath38 .",
    "once a good understanding of the small-@xmath0 evolution is obtained , it should be possible to use the underlying @xmath39-factorization theorem in bfkl / ccfm , where observables are described in terms of process  dependent off - shell matrix element and universal un - integrated parton densities , to make firm predictions of any other small-@xmath0 measurement , just as normal dglap parton densities and matrix elements are used today at large @xmath3 .",
    "thera will be the only place where these un - integrated parton densities can be measured .",
