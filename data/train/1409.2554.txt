    "the decay width of @xmath1 into 3@xmath13 shows an enhancement by the total baryon density in much the same way as @xmath1 into @xmath53 decay .",

    "one finds that the effect of the total baryon density @xmath9 overwhelms that of the isospin asymmetry @xmath44 on the @xmath164 decay .",
    "nonetheless the neutron - rich medium enhances the decay width as one can see in fig .",
    "[ drho2 ] .",
    "the relative smallness of the effect of the isospin asymmetry @xmath44 on the decay in comparison with that on the @xmath53 decay can be attributed to the fact that the mixing angle dependence of the decay amplitude is suppressed by the crossing symmetry .    here , we comment on the uncertainties of the decay widths coming from those of the lecs .",
    "the uncertainties of the @xmath1 decay width into @xmath53 and @xmath165 are both about 10% .",
    "we present figs .",

    "the line and the shaded area are same as those of fig .",
    "[ ppp_error].,width=226 ]    here , we discuss the origin of the enhancement of the decay widths with the total baryon density .",
    "it is found that the dominant density dependence for both decays comes from the term that is proportional to the low - energy constant @xmath10 in eqs .",
    "( [ mppp2 ] ) and ( [ m3pi0 ] ) for the @xmath53 and 3@xmath13 decay , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 is related to @xmath166 by @xmath167 because we assume that all the loop corrections of the nucleon mass are renormalized into lecs @xcite . substituting this relation into the second term of eq .",
    "( [ mppp2 ] ) , one finds that the prefactor of the second term reads @xmath168 it is noteworthy here that the coefficient @xmath169 is nothing but the quantity that represents the reduction rate of the quark condensate or chiral order parameter in the nuclear medium with the linear density approximation @xcite ; @xmath170 where @xmath171 and @xmath172 are the quark condensates at @xmath173 and non - zero , respectively .",
    "thus , one should be able to rewrite the decay amplitude given in eq .",
    "( [ mppp2 ] ) ( eq .",
    "( [ m3pi0 ] ) ) for the @xmath53 ( 3@xmath13 ) decay in terms of the reduction of the chiral order parameter @xmath174 . here , we rewrite the @xmath175 presented in eq .",
    "( [ mppp2 ] ) in terms of the renormalized pion decay constant @xmath176 : @xmath177 where @xmath178 from the first to the second line , we have regarded @xmath169 as a small quantity , and thus the @xmath9 dependence is absorbed into @xmath179 .",
    "as one can see in eq .",
    "( [ mppp3 ] ) , the total baryon density dependence of the decay amplitude of the @xmath180 process can be renormalized into the density dependence of the pion decay constant ) can also be rewritten in terms of @xmath179 under the assumption of the smallness of the change in the pion mass in the nuclear medium and the in - medium gell - mann  oakes  renner relation @xcite : @xmath181 ] .",
    "thus , one may say that the enhancement of the 3@xmath14 decay width originates from the chiral restoration in the nuclear medium , although more detailed analysis is necessary to establish the relevance of the partial restoration of the chiral symmetry in the enhancement of the 3@xmath14 decay of @xmath1 at finite baryon density .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth mentioning that a similar mechanism has been identified as being responsible for an enhancement of the @xmath25 cross section near the 2@xmath182 threshold in the @xmath24 meson channel in nuclear matter by jido , hatsuda , and one of the present authors @xcite , where it is found that the reduction of the chiral condensate implying the partial restoration of chiral symmetry in nuclear matter is responsible for this enhancement .",
    "furthermore , they clarified that a 4@xmath14-nucleon vertex shown in fig .  5 in ref .",
    "@xcite , which has the same structure as diagram ( @xmath118 ) in fig .",
    "[ diagrams ] in the present article , is responsible for the enhancement .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the @xmath0 mixing angle defined in eq.([defma ] ) and the @xmath1 decay into 3@xmath14 in the nuclear medium with varying isospin asymmetry on the basis of the in - medium chiral effective theory , where the fermi momentum @xmath42 as well as the pseudoscalar meson masses and momenta are treated as small expansion parameters .",
    "we have found that both the quantities are significantly modified in the nuclear medium by the asymmetry @xmath45 and the total baryon densities @xmath7 , although the densities affect both the quantities in different manners : the mixing angle increases along with the asymmetric density @xmath8 , but decreases along with the increase of the total baryon density . in terms of the @xmath4 dependence of the mixing angle ,",
    "the mixing angle increases along with @xmath4 , the slope of which is greater for larger total baryon density .",
    "the increase of the mixing angle means that the physical @xmath1 meson has a greater @xmath22 component , the isospin eigenstate of the neutral pion .",
    "it turns out that the total and asymmetric densities tend to increase the decay width of @xmath1 into @xmath53 in an additive way , although the total density dependence overwhelms that of the isospin .",
    "for example , the width is enhanced by a factor of @xmath183 to @xmath184 at @xmath98 depending on the isospin asymmetry @xmath4 .",
    "the enhancement of the width due to the isospin asymmetry is traced back to the increase of the @xmath22 component in the physical @xmath1 state .",
    "the @xmath164 decay width in the nuclear medium is enhanced by the total baryon density @xmath9 as in the case of @xmath185 decay , although the enhancement is relatively smaller than the latter case .",
    "this is because the mixing angle dependence of the @xmath164 decay amplitude is suppressed by the symmetrization of the three @xmath13 in the final state .",
    "the neutron - rich asymmetric medium slightly enhances the decay width in the @xmath164 case .",
    "the @xmath9-dependent parts of the decay amplitudes of the @xmath1 to 3@xmath14 decay given in eqs .",
    "( [ mppp2 ] ) and ( [ m3pi0 ] ) are both proportional to the low - energy constant @xmath10 , which is in turn related to the @xmath186 sigma term @xmath166 .",
    "thus , we find that the effect of the total baryon density can be rewritten in terms of the change of the quark condensate in the nuclear medium .",
    "this suggests that the enhancement of the decay rate may result from the partial restoration of chiral symmetry in the nuclear medium .",
    "further analyses are , however , necessary to elucidate the underlying mechanism of the enhancement and its possible relationship with the chiral restoration in the nuclear medium",
    ".    it may be possible to observe the modification with the nucleus target experiment with large isospin asymmetry @xmath187 at facilities such as , e.g. , spring-8 and j - parc in japan or fair , cosy , and mami in germany .    in our calculation , the decay widths in free space reproduce the experimental data fairly well : the values are roughly 60% in the @xmath180 case and 70% in the @xmath188 case compared with the experimental data @xcite . to reproduce the experimental data in free space more precisely ,",
    "the higher - order terms in the chiral perturbation should be included @xcite",
    ". some of them may be resummed into the final - state interaction of @xmath14 , more precisely , the s - wave @xmath189 correlations , which may cause the @xmath24 resonance as mentioned in sect .",
    "[ intro ] .    the nuclear medium would affect the spectral properties of the @xmath24 mode through chiral restoration @xcite ( see also , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and thus a full account of the medium effect on the @xmath24 mode including its possible softening may have a significant impact on the @xmath1 decay in the nuclear medium .",
    "our calculations do not take the effect of the @xmath36(1535 ) resonance into account as mentioned in sect .",
    ". it is known @xcite ( see also , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) that the coupling with the resonance modifies the in - medium self - energy or the optical potential of @xmath1 : it is suggested that the @xmath1-@xmath190 interaction is attractive , and the attraction might lead to a reduction of the @xmath1 mass , say of @xmath191 mev order , in the nuclear medium .",
    "furthermore , there arises an induced @xmath0 coupling through the @xmath36-nucleon hole excitations in the nuclear medium .",
    "the formula of the @xmath0 mixing angle in eq .",
    "( [ defma ] ) tells us that both the reduction of the @xmath1 mass and the additional @xmath0 coupling would cause an additional @xmath9 dependence but not the @xmath8 dependence of the mixing angle and hence an enhancement of the @xmath53 decay width . on the other hand , the 3@xmath13 decay is independent of the mixing angle , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ m3pi0 ] ) , so the effect of the resonance on the 3@xmath13 decay width should be small .",
    "we hope that we can report on a quantitative analysis of such an additional density dependence coming from the coupling with @xmath36 of the mixing angle and the decay width of the @xmath1 in the near future .",
    "recently , the possible effects of an external magnetic field on hadron properties have been the focus of intensive studies ; the relevant physical quantities include mass spectra of light hadrons@xcite and pseudoscalar@xmath28vector mixing rates in heavy quarkonia , as well as their mass shifts @xcite .",
    "we note that a strong magnetic field could also be a possible source of the isospin symmetry breaking due to the difference in the electromagnetic charges of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 quarks , and thus an external magnetic field may change the hadron properties , as we have shown in the present work .",
