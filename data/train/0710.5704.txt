    "within nearby galaxies , groups , and clusters , embedded active galactic nuclei ( agn ) have been found to interact with the surrounding hot , x - ray emitting thermal gas , causing such disturbances as shocks , ripples , and cavities ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "the cavities , which appear as x - ray surface brightness depressions , consist of low density relativistic plasma and are a consequence of the thermal gas being displaced by the jets of the agn .",
    "they have been found to be associated with the central agn of many clusters , such as perseus ( @xcite ) , hydra a ( @xcite ) , m87 ( @xcite ) , and centaurus ( @xcite ) .",
    "agn - induced disturbances are also present within the hot interstellar medium ( ism ) in the haloes of normal elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "many early - type galaxies , such as m84 ( @xcite ) , have been found to harbor cavities in their x - ray haloes .",
    "our interest in these agn - induced cavities stems from the fact that they can be used as calorimeters .",
    "the kinetic energy of the jets emanating from the central black hole can be estimated by calculating the amount of energy required to inflate the observed cavities ( @xcite ) . using this estimate",
    ", the jet power can be calculated once an approximate age of the cavity has been deduced .    for nearby large , elliptical galaxies ,",
    "accurate measurements of the density and temperature profiles of the thermal gas can be obtained from high resolution _",
    "chandra _ observations . for those systems that are sufficiently close , such that radii within an order of magnitude of the accretion radius are resolved",
    ", these measurements can be used to calculate the bondi accretion rate , given estimates of the black hole mass .",
    "@xcite , in a study of 9 x - ray luminous sources that harbor cavities , found that a tight physical correlation exists between the power available from bondi accretion of the hot gas and the observed jet power .",
    "these results are significant , especially for studies of accretion and jet formation , as well as the formation and evolution of galaxies . in particular",
    ", building upon earlier studies by @xcite and @xcite , they confirmed that the bulk of the energy produced by the central agn in these systems , which are all @xcite type - i sources , is released in the relativistic jets .",
    "the energy injected back into the environment is in principle sufficient to balance radiative cooling of the hot x - ray gas .",
    "this possibility has also been investigated by @xcite , who showed that the cooling of hot gas from the atmosphere of the host galaxy can feasibly provide the fuel for low power , radio - loud agn , and that the heating by agn feedback can balance this cooling , except perhaps in the most massive clusters .",
    "however , the manner in which the energy provided by the agn is coupled to the thermal energy of the hot gas in order to offset cooling , as well as the efficiency of this process , are as yet unknown .    because of the significance of agn activity , it is desirable to investigate further the population of galaxies which exhibit interactions between the central agn and the surrounding medium . in particular , we are interested in those sources which harbor cavities , as they offer insight into the physical properties of the agn itself .",
    "we analyzed _ chandra _ and vla data for ngc1399 and ngc4649 , both of which are large , elliptical galaxies that harbor cavities and are located in nearby clusters . because of their proximity , we are able to determine the density of the x - ray emitting gas down to radii within a factor of 10 of the accretion radius , making these two galaxies ideal for future analysis concerning bondi accretion . at present , we use the cavities in these systems to estimate the kinetic energy of the jets and jet power . we also investigate the particle content of the cavities by determining @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the ratio of the total particle energy contained in the cavity to the energy accounted for by electrons emitting synchrotron radiation in the range of 10 mhz to 10 ghz , and @xmath7 is the volume filling factor of the relativistic plasma in the cavity .",
    "the cavities are filled with relativistic charged particles and magnetic fields , which together determine the synchrotron emission from the lobes .",
    "the relative energy densities of these two components , and hence @xmath6 and @xmath7 , can not be disentangled from the emission alone .",
    "we must therefore consider the ratio @xmath5 , which , under the assumption that the gas pressure is equal to the total pressure from the radio plasma , can be related to the magnetic field strength .",
    "the maximum field strength is obtained for the minimum value of @xmath12 , and would indicate a pure electron - positron plasma uniformly filling the cavity .",
    "our discussion will proceed as follows .",
    "we begin in  [ sec : radio ] by describing the radio data selection and processing . in  [ sec : xray ] , we describe the x - ray data and preparation , as well as the identification of cavities . in ",
    "[ sec : interaction ] we present _ chandra_/vla comparisons for ngc1399 and ngc4649 and determine the power of the jets in these systems .",
    "we present the @xmath5 ratios in  [ sec : kf ] , followed by conclusions in  [ sec : concl ] .    throughout this discussion , we assume a flat @xmath13cdm cosmology with @xmath14 and @xmath15 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 .",
    "the vla radio data were obtained from the nrao archive . in selecting the data to be analyzed ,",
    "preference was given to observations with time on source @xmath16 minutes .",
    "because steep spectrum emission is brighter at lower frequencies , preference was also given to observations performed at 1.4  ghz .",
    "in addition , a - configuration or b - configuration observations at 1.4  ghz were desirable in order to provide arcsecond resolution for comparison with x - ray images from _",
    "chandra_. parameters for the vla observations of ngc1399 and ngc4649 are tabulated in table [ tab : obs ] .",
    "the radio data were reduced in the standard manner using aips . after an initial editing of the data , absolute amplitude and phase calibration",
    "were performed on each dataset using the scripts vlaprocs and vlarun . as the flux calibrator for each dataset",
    "was resolved , a model was used for the calibration . if bad data were still present after the initial calibration , those data were flagged and the calibration was repeated .",
    "each source was imaged using the task imagr .",
    "sidelobes from outlying sources were removed by using multiple facets while imaging .",
    "proper placement of the facets was determined using the task setfc , which was set up to search a 0.5 degree radius for sources in the nvss declination @xcite . ]",
    "catalogue with flux @xmath17 mjy .",
    "typically , sources outside of that range are either not bright enough or too far from the pointing center to have an appreciable effect on the quality of the image .",
    "as both sources had sufficient signal - to - noise ratios , imaging and phase - only self - calibration were then performed iteratively , until the theoretical noise was reached or until the quality of the map ceased to benefit from the iterations .",
    "radio flux density measurements are shown in table [ tab : vla ] .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     there is a striking difference between the @xmath5 limits , namely that those of ngc1399 are much lower than those of ngc4649 .",
    "this difference is linked to the radio flux , which is roughly a factor of 20 lower in ngc4649 .",
    "the lower the value of @xmath5 , the closer the assumed electron energy spectrum is to the actual one in the lobe . however , as the synchrotron plasma ages , the high energy electrons lose their energy more rapidly , and the distribution of energies shifts to lower energies and also spreads out . therefore , observing old radio lobes at high frequencies results in low radio fluxes , which , if the spectrum is assumed to be flat , underestimates the number of particles present . as a result",
    ", there would be a mismatch between the internal and external pressures . in these calculations",
    "we force the lobes to be in pressure balance by increasing @xmath6 and/or decreasing @xmath7 .",
    "we currently have a lower cut - off to the synchrotron spectrum of @xmath18  mhz .",
    "however , in old lobes there would be very low energy electrons , and so this lower cut - off might be too high . under the assumption that @xmath12 and that we have correctly modeled the synchrotron spectrum , we calculate the appropriate @xmath19 .",
    "we set an absolute lower limit of the cyclotron frequency appropriate to the magnetic field determined within the radio lobes .",
    "for the northern and southern lobes in ngc1399 , @xmath12 can be obtained using a minimum frequency of 265  hz and 49  hz respectively ( the cyclotron frequencies are 54  hz and 43  hz ) . however , in ngc4649 , even with the lower cut off at the cyclotron frequency ( @xmath20  hz ) , @xmath5 is 2700 and 890 for the northern and southern lobes respectively .",
    "another explanation is that the assumed spectrum is close to what exists in the cavity but that there are non - relativistic particles present in the lobes , especially in ngc4649 .",
    "thermal protons could be entrained as the jet travels through the inner parts of the galaxy and halo .",
    "these would exert a pressure on the surrounding x - ray gas , but would be undetectable from the radio synchrotron emission",
    ".    in ngc1399 , the limits on @xmath5 implies that there are few entrained particles and that the assumed spectrum does describe the distribution of electrons in the lobe reasonably well .",
    "however , in ngc4649 either there are many entrained particles or the model spectrum does not describe the electron population well .",
    "there is close agreement between the limits obtained from the sound speed and buoyancy timescales .",
    "we find that the only lobes which can be in equipartition between the leptons and the magnetic field are those from ngc4649 if the buoyancy timescale is used to calculate the magnetic field from the synchrotron cooling time .",
    "in analyzing _",
    "chandra _ and vla data for ngc4649 , we have found cavities in the surrounding x - ray emitting gas that have not been previously reported .",
    "we used these cavities and those in ngc1399 to estimate the power of the jets emanating from the central black hole of these systems .",
    "the @xmath21 values for ngc1399 using the sound speed expansion timescale are @xmath22 erg s@xmath1 for the northern lobe and @xmath23 erg s@xmath1 for the southern lobe .",
    "the values using the buoyancy rise time are on average a factor of 2 lower for both lobes , but are roughly in agreement with the aforementioned values within the errors . as the cavities in ngc1399 are detached from the core but presently powered by the agn jets , it is difficult to determine which timescale is the relevant one in this case . in ngc4649 ,",
    "the @xmath21 values using the sound speed expansion timescale are @xmath24 erg s@xmath1 for the northern lobe and @xmath25 erg s@xmath1 for the southern lobe .",
    "calculations using the buoyancy rise time yield similar values , within the errors .    comparing these jet powers to those calculated in @xcite",
    ", we find that our sources have jet powers that are lower than most of those in their sample .",
    "examples are m87 and ngc4696 , both of which are located within dense cluster environments .",
    "m87 is near the center of the virgo cluster and has jet powers which are roughly an order of magnitude larger than those of our sources .",
    "the jet powers for the lobes of ngc4696 , which is in the center of centaurus , are roughly 3 to 4 times those of our sources .",
    "we find that our sources have similar jet powers to those of ngc4552 in virgo , which has values of @xmath24 erg s@xmath1 and @xmath22 erg s@xmath1 , as well as those of ngc5846 , which dominates a group of intermediate mass and has jet powers of @xmath26 erg s@xmath1 for each lobe .",
    "we also investigated the particle content of the cavities by calculating @xmath5 .",
    "we find that the @xmath5 values for ngc4649 are much larger than those of ngc1399 by about 2 orders of magnitude .",
    "@xcite found that there is a large range of values for @xmath5 in cavities found in cluster galaxies .",
    "in general , @xmath5 is in the range of @xmath27 to @xmath28 for cavities that are active .",
    "the values for ngc1399 fall into this range ; however , in the case of ngc4649 , the values for @xmath5 using either timescale are more than a factor of 10 larger than the upper limit of what has been previously observed .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath12 corresponds to a lobe which is filled with a uniform electron - positron plasma with energies corresponding to emission in the range of 10  mhz to 10  ghz .",
    "large values of @xmath5 , such as those found in ngc4649 , can be achieved by large values for @xmath6 or small values for @xmath7 .",
    "large values for @xmath6 imply that , in order for there to be pressure balance , there must be particles present within the lobe which are not accounted for by the assumed spectrum .",
    "these particles can be electrons whose emission is outside the range of 10  mhz to 10  ghz or thermal protons that either exist in the jets during their formation or are entrained as the cavities travel through the surrounding medium .",
    "the filling factor @xmath7 describes the fraction of the volume of the cavity that is occupied by radio emitting plasma .",
    "the remaining volume fraction can either be occupied by thermal gas or plasma whose relativistic electrons have aged .",
    "@xcite , in studying ghost cavities as well as active cavities in centaurus and perseus , found that the older cavities have larger @xmath5 values than the active ones and have attributed this to the aging of the relativistic electrons .",
    "the @xmath5 values for ngc4649 are similar to those of ghost cavities in which the relativistic electrons have aged , though the values can also suggest that the the lobes contain entrained particles . if the electrons in the lobes of ngc4649 have aged , the model spectrum is simply not an accurate description of the electron distribution .",
    "this scenario seems likely , as the radio flux is so small that ngc4649 is expected to soon become a ghost cavity system should clear cavities remain . for ngc1399",
    ", the model spectrum appears to be an appropriate description of the lobe contents , and there are probably not many entrained particles .",
    "as was proposed by @xcite , higher power radio sources are less likely to pick up extra particles from the surrounding medium .",
    "our results agree with this description in that ngc1399 has lower @xmath5 values than ngc4649 and also higher radio power . however , there are many physical parameters to consider in investigating these values , and no clear correlation has been found between @xmath5 and any one parameter .    in calculating @xmath5 we have assumed a simple power - law spectrum . using high frequency observations to obtain radio flux measurements of a lobe whose relativistic electrons",
    "have aged would tend to cause this power - law approximation to underestimate the energy of the relativistic electrons in the lobe and therefore overestimate @xmath5 .",
    "our results , then , could be said to suggest that the lobes in ngc4649 are likely to be older than those in ngc1399 .",
    "however , these results could also suggest that the power - law approximation may be poor in both cases . in order to determine whether the power - law assumption is reasonable",
    ", it would be desirable to obtain sensitive lower frequency vla observations of these galaxies , such as at 330  mhz , that would allow for accurate measurements of the radio flux in the regions corresponding to the cavities .",
