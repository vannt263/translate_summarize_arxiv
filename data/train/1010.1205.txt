    "_ thermodynamics _ ; the phenomenological branch of physics , is a summary of the properties that real physical systems ( in thermal equilibrium ) exhibit .",
    "thermodynamics was established in the 19th century by a group of pioneers with the formulation of the law of conservation of energy relating the equivalence of work and heat as stated by robert mayer and hermann helmholtz@xcite .",
    "the total dynamics of a system can be defined independantly in terms of the main constituents of thermodynamics like entropy , temperature and the three laws connecting these state variables .",
    "this could be a reasonable argument for the robustness of thermodynamics over the last century , eventhough some of the profound peers like classical mechanics and electrodynamics underwent a lot of structural changes .",
    "thermodynamics shows its full glory when it couples with statistical physics , particularly for a microsopic system .",
    "statistical physics is that part of physics which derives emergent properties of macroscopic matter from the atomic structure and the microscopic dynamics .",
    "emergent properties here means those properties like temperature , perssure , dielectric and magnetic constants etc , which are essentially determined by the interaction of many particles ( atoms or molecules ) .",
    "exclusively , these emergent propeties are typical for many - body systems and they do not exist ( in general ) for microscopic systems . strictly speaking , statistical physics is the bridge between the microscopic and the macroscopic world and it provides methods for calculating the macroscopic properties ( for eg .",
    ", like the specific heat ) , from the microscopic information ( like the interaction energy between the particles ) .",
    "statistical mechanics introduces probabilities into physics and connects them with the fundamental physical quantity _",
    "` entropy ' _ ( the name _ ` entropy ' _ was given after the work of clausius in 1865 @xcite and also james clerk maxwell @xcite in 1878 through his `` _ _ gedankenexperiment _ _ '' .",
    "in fact , maxwell proposed the name `` statistical mechanics '' . ) .",
    "the coalescence of thermodynamics and statistical physics led to the emergence of statistical thermodynamics , established through the well known boltzmann - planck @xcite formula for the clausius entropy @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the thermodynamic probability ) and the ergodic hypothesis by boltzmann @xcite , also independantly by josiah williard gibbs @xcite , the father of the ensemble theory .",
    "in classical statistical mechanics we did not know the exact microscopic state of the system ( location in the phase space ) .",
    "we made use of the ergodic hypothesis and replaced the time average of a physical quantity with an ensemble average ie .",
    ", an average over many equivalent systems .",
    "all these developments in classical statistical mechanics almost coincided with the revolutionary concept of quantum theory by max planck , that changed the entire structure of physics .",
    "it would have been surprising if statistical mechanics could have escaped the repercussions of the quantum revolution .",
    "but the whole structure of statistical mechanics was overhauled by the introduction of the concept of indistinguishability of ( identical ) particles .",
    "but the concept of ergodicity remains untouched in the quantum case also .",
    "microcanonical and canonical ensembles retained their positions with some modifications and grand canonical ensemble made a debut . the statistical aspect which already exists in classical statistical mechanics in view of the large number of particles present in the system , has been augmented by the statistical aspect came from the probabilistic nature of the wave mechanical description .",
    "all these new concepts reformulated the ensemble theory with the introduction of density matrix , which is the quantum mechanical analogue of the density function of the classical phase space , first introduced by landau @xcite and later by von neumann @xcite , later on more rigorously by dirac @xcite .    with these remarks",
    "we are led to analyze the quantum thermodynamic properties of some simple oscillator systems like a bosonic harmonic oscillator , a fermionic harmonic oscillator and finally a supersymmetric harmonic oscillator ( which combines a bosonic and a fermionic oscillator ) .",
    "harmonic oscillator is the model system of model systems and it is effectively a single particle problem , ie .",
    ", it is a problem where the particle is bounded within a quadratic potential . hence it is always intutive to study the basic quantum thermodynamical properties of a particle trapped in a quadratic potential irrespective of the inherent character of the particle ( boson or fermion ) .",
    "classically speaking , the harmonic oscillator system is like a particle moving in the x - direction connected by a spring to a fixed point .",
    "its potential energy is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the force constant of the spring attached to the particle . in the case of a classical oscillator , the amplitude @xmath6 of the periodic motion can take a continuum of values , and hence the energy @xmath7 , starting from @xmath8 .",
    "but quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator can only take certain discrete energy values since the energy eigen spectrum is fully quantized or discretized as we will see in the forthcoming sections in detail .",
    "our main aim is to study the statistical thermodynamical quantities like internal energy , entropy and specific heat ( an attribute of the third law of thermodynamics @xcite ) .",
    "third law says that the specific heat and the limiting entropy of a quantum system vanishes as the equilibrium temperature is approa- + ched .",
    "perhaps einstein s work in 1907 @xcite(considered as the origin of quantum statistics ) proposed that quantum effects lead to the vanishing of the specific heat at zero temperature .",
    "in addition to that , we consider the effect of magnetic field on the thermodynamic properties of an electron in the combined presence of a uniform magnetic field and a parabolic potential .",
    "the quantum mechanical problem of an electron in a magnetic field was first solved by landau@xcite .",
    "peierls@xcite elucidated the concept of diamagnetism of free electrons under the influence of a magnetic field , followed by darwin@xcite who explained the role of boundary for the recovery of correct diamagnetism .",
    "even from the classical mechanical point of view this problem was quite interesting and surprising .",
    "the famous van leeuwen@xcite theorem was a fatal blow to some of the older theories of diamagnetism that abounds with subtle pitfals because of the reason that the correct bulk susceptibility calculation needed a boundary effect .",
    "later on the problem of an electron in a magnetic field has been immensively exploited and has got innumerable attention in terms of quantum transport phenomena like quantum hall effect@xcite .",
    "another paradigm , an electron in the combined presence of a uniform magnetic field and a parabolic potential was comprehensively solved by fock@xcite ( nowonwards we call this model as landau - fock - darwin ( lfd ) model ) .",
    "more recently lfd model has been extensively studied under the influence of a dissipative quantum heat bath of non - interacting oscillators for the calculation of dissipative landau diamagnetism@xcite and to verify the third law of thermodynamics@xcite . in this paper",
    "we are not interested in the much studied landau diamagnetism , but we will be looking at the equilibrium thermodynamics of the lfd problem .    we restrict ourselves to equilibrium statistical mechanics , which aims at characterising the equilibrium state in terms of given constraints , without regard to the mechanism relating to how this equilibrium state is brought about",
    ". since the systems we are interested in are those with the number of particles fixed , we can use canonical ensemble formalism to obtain the thermodynamic quantities .    with the preceding introduction the organization of the paper is as follows : in sec.2 ,",
    "we review the well known thermodynamic quantities which we want to look at . in the following subsection",
    ", we revisit the quantum thermodynamics of a simple bosonic harmonic oscillator .",
    "other two subsections mainly decribe the thermodynamics of a fermionic harmonic oscillator and a supersymmetric harmonic oscillator . in sec.3 , we analyse the problem of an electron in the combined presence of a magnetic field and a parabolic confinement potential . here we discuss the two cases viz . , electron with and without its inherent spin . in sec.4",
    ", we discuss the results and finally , sec.5 is devoted to the concluding remarks .",
    "canonical ensemble description is the most useful one , as in most practical cases it is possible to control the temperature and not the energy of the system .",
    "canonical ensemble theory depicts the situation where one has a system with a fixed number of particles , but can exchange energy with the environment with which it is attached .",
    "more precisely , a system is kept at a fixed temperature when it is in thermal equilibrium with a much larger system , referred to as a heat bath . clearly , the energy of the system under study is not a constant , but it has a well defined average energy and the magnitude of the heat energy exchanged with the bath is always small compared to the average energy .",
    "we thus have to determine probabilities for states with different energies",
    ". the relative recurrence rate of states with different energies is given by their boltzmann factor , namely , by the quantity @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the energy of the small system , and @xmath11 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "in the canonical ensemble the system is assigned a temperature , and any state can appear in it . with the small description ,",
    "we define an all important concept in the canonical ensemble , an ensemble averaged quantity known as the partition function @xmath12    partition function as such does not have a physical meaning , but this eventually clarifies the connection with thermodynamics .",
    "once we obtain the partition function , then it is easy to derive the _ free energy _",
    "which is given by @xmath13 from this formula we can derive all the thermodynamic properties , also the _ internal energy _ ( or average energy ) can be written as    @xmath14    the _ entropy _ @xmath15 and finally _ specific heat _",
    "@xmath16 or @xmath17 now we have the required formulae for the calculation of the thermodynamic quantities of the systems which we are interested in .",
    "let us briefly describe the well known quantum harmonic oscillator .",
    "we have a particle of mass @xmath18 , trapped in a parabolic well and the entire arrangement vibrates with a natural frequency @xmath19 .",
    "the whole system is in equilibrium with a thermal reservoir at temperature @xmath20 .",
    "the harmonic oscillator is a particular case in which the degree of freedom takes discrete values , but the number of different values are infinite .",
    "the states of the harmonic oscillator are all non - degenerate .",
    "probability of a state with energy @xmath21 is same as the probability of the oscillator having energy @xmath21 , with @xmath22 as the oscillator quantum number .",
    "the probability can be defined as @xmath23 where the partition function can be calculated as @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the hamiltonian for the bosonic harmonic oscillator ( the subscript @xmath26 is for bosonic ) .",
    "we can write down the hamiltonian of the bosonic harmonic oscillator in the @xmath27 space and is given by @xmath28    it is also possible to write down the hamiltonian in terms of the creation and annihilation operators @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( mathematical details can be found in some standard texbooks like quantum mechanics by zettili @xcite ) which is given by @xmath31 the subscript @xmath26 is to identify the operators as bosonic .",
    "we know @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where the wave function can be written as + @xmath34 .",
    "also @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the number operator .",
    "the bosonic operators obey the commutation relation @xmath37_{-}=1 $ ] .",
    "we know that @xmath38 .",
    "the hamiltonian operating on the state @xmath39 can be written as @xmath40 .",
    "it is observed that the energy - eigen values are @xmath41 .",
    "note here that the energy eigenvalues @xmath21 are positive , just as for a classical harmonic oscillator .",
    "but in the quantum case , the energies of the oscillator are quantized in intervals of @xmath42 , starting from a non - zero value @xmath43 , the _ zero point energy_.    with all these requirements , the partition function can be calculated as ( cf .",
    ", eq.(8 ) ) @xmath44 from the partition function we can derive all the thermodynamic quantities , and are given by :    _ free energy _",
    "@xmath45    _ internal energy _",
    "_ entropy _ @xmath47 alternatively , @xmath48 ~,\\ ] ] and finally the _ specific heat _ @xmath49",
    "thus we have derived all the thermodynamic attributes of a simple bosonic harmonic oscillator .",
    "we have described the bosonic harmonic oscillator in one dimension with a natural frequency @xmath19 .",
    "the hamiltonian of such an oscillator can be written in terms of the creation ( @xmath29 ) and annihilation ( @xmath30 ) operator that obey a commutation relation .",
    "the hamiltonian has a symmetric form since we are dealing with bose particles , so the states must also have a symmetric form .",
    "the operators corresponding to bosons obey commutaion relation , and that for fermions satisfy anti - commutation relations .",
    "that means the fermionic system have an inherent antisymmetry associated with it .",
    "therfore let us try out a hamiltonian for the fermionic harmonic oscillator with a frequency @xmath19 of the form @xcite @xmath50 the subscript @xmath51 is for fermionic .",
    "now , it is interesting to see that , the fermionic hamiltonian @xmath52 , if we assume the operators @xmath53 and @xmath54 obey the same commutation relations @xmath55_{-}=1 $ ] as bosons . then there is no dynamics associated with it .",
    "so let us assume that the operators satisfy anti - commutation relations ,    @xmath56_{+ } = 0= [ a_{f}^{\\dagger } , a_{f}^{\\dagger}]_{+}~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath57_{+ } = 1= [ a_{f}^{\\dagger } , a_{f}]_{+}~.\\ ] ]      now if we assume @xmath64 as an eigenstate of @xmath65 , then we have @xmath66 .",
    "let the ground state with no quantum be denoted by @xmath67 and it satisfies @xmath68 simiarly , the state with one quantum is identified to be @xmath69 and it satisfies @xmath70 we have @xmath71 .",
    "hence , in this case the hilbert space is two dimensional .",
    "also , one more interesting point is that , for a fermionic harmonic oscillator , the ground state energy has the opposite sign from that of a bosonic harmonic oscillator .",
    "it is possible to write the hamiltonian of a bosonic harmonic oscillator in the position and momentum coordinates , which basically equals its classical counterpart .",
    "but fermions have no classical analogue , and as a result we can not directly write down a lagrangian for the fermionic oscillator with the notions of coordinates and momenta . in order to do that , we need the notion of classical anti - commuting variables .",
    "but such variables have been extensively studied in mathematics under the name of grasman variables @xcite .",
    "we are not interested in explaining the details of the grasman variables here .    as we have identified , the hamiltonian of a fermionic oscillator given by eq.(21 ) .",
    "the fermionic oscillator is like a two level system with energy eigenvalues @xmath72 now the partiton function is trivial and is given by @xmath73 so forth the thermodynamic quantities :    _ free energy _",
    "@xmath74    _ internal energy ( or average energy ) _",
    "@xmath75    _ entropy _ @xmath76 alternatively , @xmath77 and finally the _ specific heat _ @xmath78 the difference in specific heat expressions of the bosonic and the fermionic oscillator is just a matter of sign in the denominator .",
    "supersymmetric oscillator is a simple toy model in quantum field theory , and it is a combination of a bosonic and a fermionic oscillator with the same natural frequency @xmath19 @xcite . or in other words , it is a system where one boson and one fermion get trapped in a harmonic well and the whole arrangement vibrates with a frequency @xmath19 .",
    "the energy eigenstates correspond to a boson with indefinite energy eigenstates and a fermion with two ( either zero or one ) energy eigenstates .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath79 with @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "now eq.(31 ) can be expressed as @xmath82 it is clear from the above expression that the energy eigen states of the system will be the eigenstate of the number operators @xmath36 and @xmath65 .",
    "consequently , let us define @xmath83 where @xmath84 hence we may write @xmath85 so the supersymmetric harmonic oscillator has energy levels @xmath86 .",
    "this resembles an ordinary harmonic oscillator , but without ground state energy .",
    "it is very much clear that the ground state energy of the supersymmetric oscillator vanishes , ie .",
    ", @xmath87      certainly , eqs ( 37 ) , ( 38 ) and ( 39 ) indicates that , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath100 constitute an algebra which involves both commutators and anti commutators .",
    "this algebra is known as the _ graded lie algebra_. this algebra have a beautiful consequence , namely , if the ground state is invariant under the supersymmetry transformations ( ie . ,",
    "@xmath101 and + @xmath102 ) , then the ground state vanishes in supersymmetry theory .",
    "@xmath98 is really a hermitian conjugate of @xmath97 .",
    "energy eigenvalues of the supersymmetric oscillator is @xmath103 it is now straight forward to calculate the canonical partition function : @xmath104 or @xmath105 now as usual the thermodynamic quantities follows :    _ free energy _",
    "_ internal energy ( or average energy ) _",
    "@xmath107    _ entropy _ @xmath108 and finally the _ specific heat _ @xmath109 in an alternative form , specific heat can be written as @xmath110 this expression can be represented in terms of the bosonic specific heat as @xmath111 the specific heat has more bosonic character than fermionic .",
    "hence the variation of the specific heat with temperature is expected to be more bosonic in nature .",
    "the problem of an electron in a uniform and homogeneous magnetic field attained tremendous attention nowadays in mesoscopic physics @xcite and quantum dots or the quantum confined nanostructures@xcite .",
    "it was landau who emulated this problem and conveyed that the problem of an elctron in a magnetic field is essentially quantum mechanical and can be solved exactly through the first principles of quantum mechanics .",
    "we are interested in the thermodynamics of this problem with an additional harmonic oscillator potential .    since the energy eigen spectrum of the free electron under the magnetic field ( both in the absence and presence of the parabolic confinement ) shows simple harmonic oscillator structure , we must commit to say that the quantum mechanical formulation is identical to that of a harmonic oscillator . moreover , harmonic oscillator potential is the only case where simple results can be obtained .",
    "it allows one to discuss in detail the effects of the boundary and the way in which the bulk limit is attained .",
    "this is the reason we are interested in deriving the thermodynamic properties of this landau - fock - darwin model ( lfd ) .",
    "it is worth to study the effect of spin of the electron trapped , on the model , so we analyse two cases viz . , the lfd model with and without spin .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we have considered the case where the electron possesses spin @xmath1 .      here , the magnetic behavior of the electron has been considered .",
    "permanent magnetic dipole moment of electron is ignored and only the influence of the external magnetic field on the electron is taken into account .",

    "the fock - darwin energy spectrum is closely related to the energy eigen spectrum of an ideal rotating bec , with the trap is circular in cross section .",
    "this spectrum is interesting because it shows how smoothly the spectrum interpolates between the bound states of a two - dimensional harmonic oscillator ( when @xmath122 ) to the case of the landau levels of a free particle in a magnetic field ( when @xmath123 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian ( cf . , eq .",
    "( 50 ) ) can be effectively canonically transformed into the sum of two independent one dimensinal harmonic oscillators with two frequencies @xmath124 and @xmath125 either by introducing the generating function technique of valatin@xcite or by quantum mechanical operators@xcite .",
    "we define two operators @xmath126-\\frac{l}{2}[\\partial_{x}\\mp i\\partial_{y}]~,\\ ] ] with @xmath127 is the fock - darwin length .",

    "the fock - darwin levels are degenerate , @xmath134 , whereas a strong magnetic field leads to the formation of the structure of landau energy levels , represented by the cyclotron energy @xmath135 .",
    "thermodynamics of this problem has been studied by jishad et al @xcite , where they have used the path integral approach to calculate the partition function .",
    "we obtain the partition function in the canonical ensemble as @xmath136 now the thermodynamic quantities : _ free energy _ @xmath137 the _ internal energy _ is given by @xmath138 _ entropy _ @xmath139 finally _ specific heat _",
