    "since the early days of quantum mechanics there has been enormous interest in exactly solvable quantum systems .",
    "in fact , schrdinger himself initiated a program @xcite which resulted in the famous schrdinger - infeld - hull factorization method @xcite . in the last 10 - 15 years",
    "this program has been revived in connection with supersymmetric ( susy ) quantum mechanics @xcite . to be a little more precise ,",
    "it has been found @xcite that the so - called property of shape - invariance of a given schrdinger potentials , which is in fact equivalent to the factorization condition , is sufficient for the exact solvability of the eigenvalue problem of the associated schrdinger hamiltonian .",
    "however , susy quantum mechanics has also been shown to be an effective tool in finding new exactly solvable systems .",
    "here in essence one utilizes the fact that susy quantum mechanics consists of a pair of essentially isospectral hamiltonians whose eigenstates are related by susy transformations .",
    "this is the basic idea of a recent construction method for so - called conditionally exactly solvable potentials @xcite .",
    "here one constructs a susy quantum system for which , under certain conditions imposed on its parameters , one of the susy partner hamiltonians reduces to that of an exactly solvable ( shape - invariant ) one .",
    "other approaches , which are also based on the presence of pairs of essentially isospectral hamiltonians , go back to an idea formulated by darboux @xcite , are based on the inverse scattering method @xcite , or on the factorization method @xcite .",
    "clearly , these approaches are closely connected to each other and to the susy approach .",
    "in this paper we will construct with the help of the darboux method all possible susy partners of the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian on the real line and discuss their algebraic properties in some detail .",
    "in doing so we review in the next section the darboux method and explicitly show its equivalence to the supersymmetric approach .",
    "section 3 then briefly presents the basic idea for the construction of conditionally exactly solvable ( ces ) potentials .",
    "section 4 is devoted to a detailed discussion of the harmonic oscillator case . here",
    "we first present all possible susy partners of the harmonic oscillator and give explicit expressions for the corresponding eigenstates . secondly , with the help of the standard ladder operators of the harmonic oscillator we introduce similar ladder operators for the susy partners and show that they close a quadratic algebra , which is also briefly discussed .",
    "finally , we introduce so - called non - linear coherent states which are associated with this non - linear algebra .",
    "the properties of these coherent states are discussed in some detail .",
    "in this section we briefly review the darboux method @xcite and show its connection to supersymmetric quantum mechanics @xcite . in doing",
    "so we start with considering a pair of standard schrdinger hamiltonians acting on @xmath0 , @xmath1 and a linear operator @xmath2 obeying the intertwining relation @xmath3 it is obvious that this intertwining relation can not be obeyed for arbitrary functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in fact , the relation ( [ gjunker:2.3 ] ) explicitly reads @xmath6 \\displaystyle \\left(\\frac{\\hbar^2}{m}\\,\\phi'(x)+\\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2m}}\\,v_-(x )   -\\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2m}}\\,v_+(x ) \\right)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\;.    \\end{array}\\ ] ] as the unit operator @xmath7 and the momentum operator ( i.e.@xmath8 ) are linearly independent , their coefficients have to vanish .",
    "in other words , we are left with two conditions between the three functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 : @xmath9 inserting the first one into the second one and integrating once we find @xmath10 where @xmath11 is an arbitrary real integration constant sometimes called factorization energy @xcite . with this relation and with ( [ gjunker:2.5 ] )",
    "we can express the two potentials under consideration in terms of the function @xmath5 : @xmath12 at this point one realizes that these are so - called susy partner potentials @xcite .",
    "in fact , using relations ( [ gjunker:2.8 ] ) we note that @xmath13 these supersymmetric partner hamiltonians are due to the intertwining relation ( [ gjunker:2.3 ] ) essentially isospectral , that is , @xmath14 their eigenstates are related via susy transformations . to make this more explicit ,",
    "let us denote by @xmath15 the eigenstates of @xmath16 for eigenvalues @xmath17 , @xmath18 then these states are related by susy transformations @xcite @xmath19 in addition to the states in ( [ gjunker:2.11 ] ) one of the two hamiltonians @xmath16 may have an additional eigenstate @xmath20 with eigenvalue @xmath11 obeying the first - order differential equation @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively . in terms of the function",
    "@xmath5 they explicitly read @xmath23 where @xmath24 stands for a normalization constant .",
    "clearly , only one of the two solutions ( [ gjunker:2.13 ] ) may be square integrable .",
    "this situation corresponds to an unbroken susy .",
    "if none of them is square integrable then susy is said to be broken @xcite .",
    "the darboux method reviewed in this section can now be used to find for a given potential , say @xmath25 , all its possible susy partners @xmath26 .",
    "firstly , one has to solve equation ( [ gjunker:2.7 ] ) , that is , finding all possible susy potentials @xmath5",
    ". this in fact corresponds to find all possible factorizations for the corresponding hamiltonian @xmath27 .",
    "finally , the corresponding susy partner @xmath26 can be obtained via ( [ gjunker:2.5 ] ) . in this way",
    "one can construct new exactly solvable potentials .",
    "the parameters involved in the susy potential turn out to obey certain conditions and therefore these new potentials are more precisely called conditionally exactly solvable ( ces ) potentials .",
    "let us note that the darboux method may be generalized to intertwining operators containing higher orders of the momentum operator @xcite .",
    "in this section we give some more details on the construction of ces potentials using the darboux method .",
    "as just mentioned above we start with a given potential @xmath25 and try to find all its associated susy potentials .",
    "that is , we have to find the most general solution of the generalized riccati equation ( [ gjunker:2.7 ] ) . in doing",
    "so we will first linearize this non - linear differential equation via the substitution @xmath28 , @xmath29 which is actually a schrdinger - like equation for @xmath25 .",
    "note , however , that we are not restricted to normalizable solution of ( [ gjunker:3.14 ] ) . in other words ,",
    "the energy - like parameter @xmath11 is up to now still arbitrary .",
    "in terms of @xmath30 the linear operator @xmath31 reads @xmath32 and thus is only a well - defined operator on @xmath0 if @xmath30 does not have any zeros on the real line . as a consequence",
    "we may admit only those solutions of ( [ gjunker:3.14 ] ) which have no zeros .",
    "form sturmian theory we know that this is only possible if @xmath11 is below the ground - state energy of @xmath27 which we will denote by @xmath33 .",
    "hence , we obtain a first condition on the parameter @xmath11 , which reads @xmath34 .",
    "this also implies that @xmath11 does not belong to the spectrum of @xmath27 .",
    "in fact , the associated eigenfunction ( [ gjunker:2.13 ] ) would read @xmath35 , which is not normalizable due to condition put on @xmath11 .",
    "the above condition on @xmath11 is still not sufficient to guarantee a nodeless solution .",
    "being a second - order linear differential equation ( [ gjunker:3.14 ] ) has two linearly independent fundamental solutions denoted by @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "hence , the most general solution for @xmath34 is given by a linear combination of the fundamental ones : @xmath38 therefore , the condition that @xmath30 does not vanish also imposes conditions on the parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 , which have to be studied case by case @xcite .",
    "let us now assume that @xmath27 is an exactly solvable hamiltonian , which means that its eigenvalues @xmath41 and eigenstates @xmath42 are exactly known in closed form . for simplicity",
    "we have assumed that @xmath27 has a purely discrete spectrum enumerated by @xmath43 such that @xmath44 .",
    "then via the method outlined above one can construct all its susy partners @xmath45 which are conditionally exactly solvable due to the conditions which have to be imposed on the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath11 . by construction",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath27 are also eigenvalues of @xmath45 and the corresponding eigenfunctions are obtained via the susy transformation ( [ gjunker:2.12 ] ) . in the case of unbroken susy @xmath45",
    "has one additional eigenvalue @xmath11 which belongs to its ground state given by @xmath47 .",
    "finally , we note that in terms of @xmath30 the partner potentials read @xmath48 and form a two - parameter family label by @xmath11 and @xmath49 .",
    "note that only the quotient @xmath49 or its inverse is relevant for ( [ gjunker:3.17 ] ) . for various examples of ces potentials found by this method",
    "see @xcite . here",
    "we limit our discussion to those related to the harmonic oscillator .",
    "in this section we will now construct all possible susy partner potentials for the harmonic oscillator @xmath50 , @xmath51 , via the darboux method . the corresponding schrdinger - like equation ( [ gjunker:3.14 ] )",
    "reads in this case is given in units of @xmath52 and all energy - like quantities are given in units of @xmath53 . ]",
    "@xmath54 and has as general solution a linear combination of confluent hypergeometric functions @xmath55\\;.\\ ] ] the condition that @xmath30 does not have a real zero implies that @xmath39 must not vanish and thus can be set equal to unity without loss of generality .",
    "furthermore , @xmath40 has to obey the inequality @xcite @xmath56 the corresponding partner potentials of the harmonic oscillator then read according to ( [ gjunker:3.17 ] ) @xmath57 we note that for the above @xmath30 susy remains unbroken and therefore , the spectral properties of @xmath45 are given by @xmath58 \\displaystyle    \\phi^-_\\varepsilon(x ) = \\frac{n_-\\ , e^{x^2/2 } }      { _ { 1}f_{1}(\\frac{1 - 2\\varepsilon}{4},\\frac{1}{2},x^2 ) +      \\beta\\ ; x\\;_{1}f_{1}(\\frac{3 - 2\\varepsilon}{4},\\frac{3}{2},x^2)}\\;,\\\\[4 mm ] \\displaystyle \\phi^-_n(x)=\\frac{\\exp\\{-x^2/2\\}}{[\\sqrt{\\pi}\\,2^{n+1 } n !   ( n+1/2-\\varepsilon)]^{1/2 } }   \\left[h_{n+1}(x)+\\left(\\frac{u'(x)}{u(x)}-x\\right)h_n(x)\\right]\\ ; ,    \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 denotes the hermite polynomial of degree @xmath60 .",
    "figures of the potential family ( [ gjunker:4.21 ] ) for various values of @xmath11 and @xmath40 can be found in @xcite . here",
    "let us stress that one can even allow for complex valued @xmath61 $ ] which in turn will give rise to complex potentials generating the same real spectrum @xcite .",
    "we also note that the present ces potential ( [ gjunker:4.21 ] ) contains as special cases those previously obtain by abraham and moses @xcite and by mielnik @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for a detailed discussion .",
    "we will now analyse the algebraic structure for the partner hamiltonians of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "in fact , using the standard raising and lowering operators of the harmonic oscillator @xmath62 , @xmath63 which close the linear algebra @xmath64=-a\\;,\\quad [ h_+,a^\\dagger ] = a^\\dagger\\;,\\quad [ a , a^\\dagger]={\\bf 1}\\;,\\ ] ] one may introduce via the susy transformation ( [ gjunker:2.12 ] ) similar ladder operators for the susy partners @xcite @xmath65 which act on the eigenstates of @xmath45 in the following way @xmath66   b^\\dagger|\\phi^-_{n}\\rangle=     \\sqrt{(n+\\frac{3}{2}-\\varepsilon)(n+1)(n+\\frac{1}{2}-\\varepsilon ) }    b|\\phi^-_{0}\\rangle=0\\;,\\quad   b|\\phi^-_{\\varepsilon}\\rangle=0\\;,\\quad   b^\\dagger|\\phi^-_{\\varepsilon}\\rangle=0\\;.    \\end{array}\\ ] ] the last two relations explicate that the ground state @xmath67 of @xmath45 is isolated in the sense that it can not be reached via @xmath68 from any of the excited states and , vice versa , the excited states can not be constructed with @xmath69 from @xmath67 . these ladder operators close together with the hamiltonian @xmath45 the quadratic , hence non - linear , algebra @xmath70=-b\\;,\\quad [ h_-,b^\\dagger]=b^\\dagger\\;,\\quad   [ b , b^\\dagger]=3h_-^2 - 4\\varepsilon h_-+\\varepsilon^2\\;.\\ ] ] this quadratic algebra belongs to the class of so - called @xmath71 algebras and may be viewed as a polynomial deformation of the @xmath72 lie algebra .",
    "such deformations have been discussed by rocek @xcite and , within a more general context , by karassiov @xcite and katriel and quesne @xcite .",
    "the quadratic casimir operator associated with the algebra ( [ gjunker:4.27 ] ) reads @xmath73 in the fock space representation ( [ gjunker:4.25 ] ) we have the following explicit expression @xmath74 and the relations @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "hence the casimir ( [ gjunker:4.29 ] ) vanishes within this representation as expected @xcite .",
    "let us now construct the non - linear coherent states @xcite associated with the quadratic algebra ( [ gjunker:4.27 ] ) .",
    "there are several ways to define such states @xcite . here",
    "we will define them as eigenstates of the `` non - linear '' annihilation operator @xmath68 , leading essentially to so - called barut - girardello coherent states @xcite .",
    "we also note that the construction procedure presented below is very similar to that of coherent states associated with quantum groups @xcite .",
    "let us note that the ground state @xmath77 of @xmath45 is isolated and therefore we may construct the coherent states over the excited states @xmath78 only . for this reason we make the ansatz @xmath79 where @xmath80 is an arbitrary complex number and the real coefficients @xmath81",
    "are to be determined from the defining relation @xmath82 using relations ( [ gjunker:4.25 ] ) we obtain the following recurrence relation for the @xmath83 s , @xmath84^{-1/2 }   \\;. \\label{gjunker:4.33}\\ ] ] that is , the coefficients @xmath83 for @xmath85 can be expressed in terms of @xmath86 , @xmath87^{-1/2 }   \\label{gjunker:4.34}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 denotes pochhammer s symbol .",
    "the remaining coefficient @xmath89 is determined via the normalization of the coherent states @xmath90 thus , we can express @xmath86 in terms of a generalized hypergeometric function @xcite @xmath91    let us now discuss some properties of these non - linear coherent states .",
    "first we note that these states are not orthogonal for @xmath92 as expected : @xmath93 secondly , let us investigate whether these states form an overcomplete set . in other words",
    ", we consider the question : can these states generate a resolution of the unit operator ?",
    "for this we have to recall that the non - linear coherent states have been constructed over the excited states of @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , we start with postulating a positive measure @xmath94 on the complex @xmath80-plane obeying the following resolution of unity : @xmath95 within the polar decomposition @xmath96 we make the ansatz @xmath97 with a yet unknown positive density @xmath98 on the positive half - line . inserting this ansatz into ( [ gjunker:4.38 ] )",
    "we obtain the following conditions on @xmath98 @xmath99 hence , @xmath98 is a probability density on the positive half - line defined by its moments given on the right - hand side of ( [ gjunker:4.40 ] ) . let us note that the integral in ( [ gjunker:4.40 ] ) may be viewed as a mellin transformation @xcite of @xmath98 and in turn the latter is given by the inverse mellin transformation of the moments .",
    "this inverse mellin transformation turns out to lead to the integral representation of meijer s g - function @xcite . in other words",
    ", we have the explicit form : @xmath100    in figure 1 a plot of the radial density @xmath101 is given showing that it leads to a well - behaved positive measure on the complex @xmath80-plane .",
    "finally , let us point out that similar non - linear coherent states associated with the ces potentials of the radial harmonic oscillator have been constructed in @xcite . in that case broken as well as unbroken susy can be considered and the corresponding symmetry algebra is a cubic one . in analogy to the discussion in @xcite one can show that the coherent states discussed here are also minimum uncertainty states .",
