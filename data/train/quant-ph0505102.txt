    "an important parameter in the field of atomic collisions , which can characterise much of a particle s collision properties , is the scattering length .",
    "defined in terms of the s - wave phase shift at zero collision energy , validity of the scattering length is restricted to the wigner threshold regime . at higher energies",
    "the scattering length description begins to break down , and the total cross - section deviates from @xmath0 times the scattering length squared . despite that fact , the concept of a scattering length remains useful when widened by simply defining an _ effective _ scattering length at any collision energy , still in the s - wave approximation  @xcite or for higher partial waves  @xcite .    for cesium in particular the collision energy dependence of",
    "the scattering length takes on special importance .",
    "existing methods for estimating scattering lengths have been very successful with rubidium and lighter alkali atoms  ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a thorough review and the following references for more recent work utilizing bose - einstein condensate  ( bec ) mean field expansion  @xcite , rethermalization  @xcite , ion flux rates  @xcite , and bragg spectroscopy  @xcite ) .",
    "however , measurements of cesium scattering lengths show an unusual degree of disagreement .",
    "for example , the triplet scattering length of @xmath1cs has been predicted to be many various values ranging from -1100@xmath2 to 2400@xmath2 ( with @xmath2 being a bohr radius ) .",
    "the source of this disagreement is that the @xmath1cs triplet scattering length exhibits strong variation with collision energy , due to a nearly bound above threshold resonance  @xcite . in different collision energy regimes",
    "all the quoted values can be correct .",
    "most recently , the @xmath1cs triplet scattering length at near zero collision energy has been predicted to be 2440(25)@xmath2 by first fitting predictions of the expected interatomic hamiltonian to the most accurate feshbach resonance measurements available  @xcite .",
    "although the energy dependence of the cs triplet scattering length has been directly observed using thermal equilibration  @xcite and ballistic scattering  @xcite , since those techniques rely on thermal clouds of atoms , they are limited to thermal spreads in collision energy .",
    "their estimates will be averages over a spread of collision energies , with the smallest such spread being @xmath3  khz in ref .",
    "@xcite . in regimes of strong variation with collision energy , such an effect could be considerable .",
    "described here is a scheme for determining the effective scattering length over a range of collision energies which does not suffer from that drawback .",
    "it exploits a well known effect on trapped pairs of atoms : the interaction between the atoms will alter the trap vibrational eigenenergies .",
    "the main idea of the scheme is to infer the scattering length by measuring the transition energies between vibrational eigenstates . both the magnitude and the sign of the effective scattering length can be inferred and the range of collision energies at which the scattering occurs is controlled by choosing the trap frequency . the tradeoff for increased precision of collision energy",
    "is increased sensitivity to measurement uncertainty and noise .",
    "error analysis shows that successful application of this method  ( e.g.  approx  @xmath4 accuracy in the scattering length estimate ) will require spectroscopic measurement uncertainty and trap frequency stabilisation of @xmath5 and @xmath6 of the trap frequency , respectively .",
    "finally , an estimate of the energy dependence of the effective scattering length will be a useful tool .",
    "for example , in cesium fountain clocks , collision energy dependent frequency shifts are currently one of the main limiting factors in the precision of the clocks . with a prediction of the effective scattering length",
    ", the clock shifts could be estimated from a known expression based on the boltzmann equation  @xcite .",
    "another example is the predicted effect , from energy dependence in the scattering length , on the ground state energy of a tightly confined bec  @xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii a brief exposition of the theoretical background is given and a few important equations are introduced . in section  iii a procedure for estimating the effective scattering length from knowledge of trap spectra for a pair of trapped atoms is outlined . in section  iv two proposed measurement schemes are described and examples of scattering length extraction for each are shown . a discussion of the schemes including error estimates",
    "is then made , followed by , in section  v , some concluding remarks .",
    "the proposed scheme for estimating elastic scattering lengths from trap spectroscopy is based on the combination of two theoretical ideas .",
    "the first is the collisional energy shift of trap vibrational levels as computed in refs .",
    "the second is a resonance model for the effective scattering length in the presence of open channel ( virtual ) and closed channel ( feshbach ) resonances as summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the first theoretical ingredient",
    ", the interaction between two atoms , each of mass @xmath7 , is modelled with an s - wave delta function pseudopotential which takes the form @xmath8 the strength of the interaction is parameterized by the scattering length , @xmath9 , and involves only the relative coordinate , @xmath10 .",
    "thus , in a harmonic trap , for which the center of mass motion can be separated from the vibrational motion , the center of mass eigenenergies are of the usual harmonic oscillator states .",
    "the relative coordinate eigenstates are altered by the interaction so that in a spherically symmetric harmonic trap the eigenenergies are the solutions of the equation @xmath11 with @xmath12 in units of @xmath13 , @xmath14 being the characteristic size of the trap for the relative motion , and @xmath9 being the scattering length .",
    "this expression is sufficient to make accurate estimates of trap vibrational eigenenergies as long as the trap is shallow enough that the collision energy of the atoms is in the wigner threshold regime and the condition @xmath15 holds  @xcite .    in order to estimate trap eigenenergies at higher trap frequencies , eq .",
    "( [ busch3d ] ) was generalized to include energy dependence in the pseudopotential strength  @xcite .",
    "the new condition is the same as eq .",
    "( [ busch3d ] ) with an energy dependent scattering length , @xmath16 also with @xmath12 in units of @xmath13 .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that eq .",
    "( [ bolda3d ] ) accurately predicts the eigenenergies for tight traps .",
    "the new condition of validity is that the trap characteristic length be much longer than the van  der  waals potential scale length  ( see appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , rather than the scattering length .",
    "the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ bolda3d ] ) is for convenience defined as the intercept function , @xmath17 .",
    "the function @xmath18 is an effective scattering length defined in terms of the s - wave phase shift , @xmath19 , @xmath20 which incorporates the combined effects of all molecular interactions at energy @xmath21 .",
    "the intersections of the intercept function and the effective scattering length are the eigenenergies of the relative coordinate motion .",
    "the second ingredient is a functional form for the energy dependence of the scattering length , eq .",
    "( [ effective scattering length ] ) . a reasonably accurate model , which includes the effect of a single resonance is @xmath22 with @xmath23 being a constant background piece , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 defining the energy dependence  .",
    "this form for eq .",
    "( [ general model fit ] ) is a generic simplification of the correct resummed expression and only approximates the true resonance behavior , but for our purposes , which is fitting away from the resonance , it is sufficient . comparison of this form with numerical data from a close coupling code based on the most accurate cs potentials available  @xcite shows excellent agreement .",
    "( 1 ) shows numerically calculated scattering lengths for a collision between doubly - polarized cesium atoms and a fit to the simulated data with eq .",
    "( [ general model fit ] ) .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "( 1 ) shows a magnified region with the intercept function superimposed . in this case",
    "a single resonance fit is sufficient , however , a dual resonance model may be necessary in some cases , to account for closely spaced resonances .    ) .",
    "the inset shows a close - up with the intercept function superimposed as a dashed line .",
    "the intersections of the effective scattering length and the intercept function are the vibrational eigenenergies .",
    "( @xmath26 is the bohr radius.),width=302 ]",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , the eigenenergies of the relative motion are found at the intersections of the effective scattering length , @xmath18 , and the intercept function , @xmath17 .",
    "conversely , if the eigenenergies are known , the effective scattering length can be extracted by matching its intersections with the intercept function to the known eigenenergies .",
    "procedurely , that can be accomplished by solving a set of equations consisting of , @xmath27 for discrete values of the collision energy , @xmath28 .",
    "the unknowns are the parameters of the model for @xmath18 and any single absolute eigenenergy of the trap .",
    "the last of those unknowns , an absolute eigenenergy  ( relative to trap zero ) , is included as a fitting parameter because in any experiment only energy differences are observed .",
    "thus for a single resonance model there are four unknowns ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and e.g. @xmath29 ) and at least four equations for any four eigenenergies and measurements of the energy differences between those eigenenergies are needed .    in practice the equations are non - linear and do not allow a simple solution .",
    "instead we use a two - step process to determine the unknown parameters .",
    "for example , for the single resonance model , choosing the lowest four eigenenergies , we do a least squares fit of the parameters @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 to the equation @xmath30 for a fixed value of @xmath29 .",
    "this will yield a least squares error for each best fit , denoted by @xmath31 where the summation is over the remaining energies .",
    "a near zero minimum of @xmath32 will locate a reference eigenenergy @xmath29 which gives a good fit .",
    "if there is more than one near zero minimum in the function @xmath33 , either more transition energies or outside estimates of the scattering length can be used to decide which is the true eigenenergy .",
    "moreover , it should be remembered that the intercept function has asymptotes related to the ` tangent ' function contained in it .",
    "the intersection points of the effective scattering length and the intercept function must be within those asymptotes and there can be only one eigenenergy per interval .",
    "there are two issues that must be addressed in order to make this method experimentally viable .",
    "the first is that atoms must be trapped in isolated pairs .",
    "the second is that the transition energies between trap vibrational eigenstates must be extracted .",
    "both of these issues will depend on the particular atoms being measured . in the examples described in the following subsections , pairs of hyperfine ground state cs atoms with no relative angular momentum , assuming a spherical and harmonic trapping potential , will be analyzed .    in regards to the first issue",
    ", techniques currently exist for creating mott - insulator states in optical lattices with one or two atoms per lattice site from a single component bec  @xcite . for measurements of the scattering length between identical atoms",
    ", such techniques will properly set up the system .",
    "pairs of homonuclear atoms in different hyperfine states or magnetic sublevels could also be initialized if the atoms may be individually addressed in a spin dependent lattice  @xcite . in the case of different atoms ,",
    "techniques have recently been proposed  @xcite .    in regards to the second issue , there are two ways in which the energy level spacings can be measured . which one to use depends on the collisional lifetime of the hyperfine state and magnetic sublevel of the pair of atoms .",
    "the distinction between stable and unstable states is important because pairs of trapped atoms with high atomic densities  ( @xmath34 ) , and long measurement pulses  ( @xmath35 ) will be necessary in order to measure the collisional shift of vibrational eigenenergies .",
    "if the atomic pair s states are stable with respect to transitions to other channels on a timescale longer than the measurement time , then raman spectroscopy techniques can be used to measure the vibrational transition frequencies .",
    "if , on the other hand , the pair s states will scatter to other channels on times shorter than the measurement time , another method based on measuring rabi oscillations , can be applied .",
    "both methods are illustrated through examples in the following subsections . in each case scattering lengths from the transition amplitudes obtained via close coupling numerical computations  @xcite are used to generate simulated spectral data  ( e.g.  figs .",
    "( 2 )  and  ( 5 ) ) .",
    "the simulated spectra are then put through the procedure of section  iii to re - infer the scattering lengths .",
    "the case of a pair of cs atoms in their doubly - polarized internal state , @xmath36 , falls into the category of a stable hyperfine channel , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 denote the internal hyperfine state and the magnetic sublevel of atom @xmath24 .",
    "the presence of a small external magnetic field such that magnetic splittings are large compared to the trapping frequencies is assumed .",
    "the relative coordinate vibrational energy levels for such a pair of atoms in a harmonic trap with a frequency of 4  khz is shown in fig .",
    "( 2 ) .    ) through 4th excited relative coordinate vibrational eigenenergies are shown .",

    "the spacing between the eigenenergies is roughly 8  khz , as expected for symmetric bosonic eigenfunctions .",
    "the interacting eigenlevels are shifted to higher energies relative to the non - interacting ones because the scattering length is positive in the shown energy range ( see fig .",
    "( 1 ) ) , making the interaction repulsive .    in this case",
    "the vibrational energy spacings can be measured with raman spectroscopy by setting the virtual intermediate state far off - resonant from an excited molecular state .",
    "experiments in which vibrational transition frequencies have been measured exist in the literature .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors use four - wave mixing and detection of a phase - conjugate signal  ( see ref .  @xcite for a review ) to measure the quantization of atomic motion in an lattice . by such a process",
    "they are able to see vibrational transitions between adjacent levels .",
    "recently , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors have been able to resolve vibrational transitions using photo - association spectrocopy . in this latter reference",
    "the experimental setup is an optical lattice filled with isolated pairs of rb in their doubly - polarized hyperfine state .",
    "their configuration is exactly what is necessary in the present scheme . in both of those implementations",
    "the resolution of the transition frequencies were insufficient for purposes here .",
    "a combination of the ideas and techniques of both experiments might be used for gaining the needed accuracy .    assuming that the energy level spacings are perfectly measured for the lowest few vibrational eigenstates , the least squares error , @xmath32 , is shown in the inset of fig .",

    "for a pair of trapped cs atoms in the same hyperfine state and with magnetic sublevels such that the total projection quantum number , @xmath52 , is non - extremal , there will be a degenerate set of magnetic sublevel pairs .",
    "if collisions between the atoms couple the magnetic sublevels but do not change @xmath53 , as is the case for alkali - metal atoms , such states will fall into the category of states that elastically scatter into other channels .",
