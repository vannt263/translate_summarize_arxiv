    "according to the unification paradigm for seyfert galaxies , seyfert 1s , which show broad optical emission lines , and 2s , which do not , are intrinsically the same objects , but the nuclei of the latter class are obscured by dust along our line of sight in dusty molecular tori @xcite .",
    "it is widely accepted that the ultimate energy source of seyfert _ nuclei _ ( although not of their extended host galaxies ) is the release of gravitational energy caused by mass accretion onto a central supermassive blackhole ( so - called agn activity ) .    however , it has recently been argued that strong signatures of starbursts are detected in the nuclear uv",
    " optical spectra of seyfert 2 galaxies ( heckman et al .",
    "1997 ; gonzalez delgado et al . 1998 ; storchi - bergmann et al .",
    "2000 ; gonzalez delgado , heckman & leitherer 2001 ) , and that the intrinsic extinction - corrected luminosities of compact nuclear starbursts ( hereafter ` compact ' is used to mean a size scale of less than a few 100 pc ) could be comparable to the luminosities of the agn @xcite .",
    "in contrast , @xcite investigated the co indices in the near - infrared @xmath1-band spectra of seyfert 2 nuclei , and found no evidence for the presence of strong compact nuclear starbursts .",
    "although these authors observed different samples of seyfert 2 galaxies , it is nevertheless striking that they draw such contradictory conclusions on the energetic role of compact nuclear starbursts in seyfert 2 nuclei .    according to @xcite ,",
    "compact nuclear starbursts are natural byproducts of agns dusty molecular tori . in this case , since direct uv  optical emission from the agn is highly attenuated in seyfert 2 nuclei , the less strongly obscured compact nuclear starburst emission will inevitably make a relatively strong contribution to the observed uv  optical fluxes in these objects .",
    "thus , the detection of signatures of compact nuclear starbursts in the observed uv  optical spectra of seyfert 2 nuclei @xcite would not be surprising .",
    "however , to obtain a deeper understanding of the nature of seyfert 2 nuclei , it is certainly more important to quantify the energetic importance of compact nuclear starbursts than simply to investigate their presence . @xcite estimated the magnitudes of compact nuclear starbursts , based on their extinction - corrected uv data , for four uv - bright seyfert 2 galaxies , while for many other seyfert 2 galaxies that have been studied optically , no quantitative discussions of the absolute magnitudes of compact nuclear starbursts have been made @xcite . even the uv - based quantitative discussion could contain large uncertainties , because of the susceptibility of uv emission to dust extinction ; the extinction correction factor for uv data may vary drastically depending on the assumed amount of dust and its spatial distribution , and has often been claimed to be quantitatively uncertain in particular applications @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties in the dust extinction correction are much less in the near - infrared @xmath1-band data taken by ivanov et al .",
    "however , the spectral signatures of starbursts are weak , so that careful subtraction of old stellar and agn emission is required to estimate the magnitudes of compact nuclear starbursts @xcite .    at 34 @xmath0 m",
    ", we possess powerful diagnostic tools to distinguish between starburst and agn activity , to detect weak starbursts , and to estimate the magnitudes of compact nuclear starbursts in seyfert 2 galaxies with fewer quantitative uncertainties . as shown by imanishi & dudley ( 2000 , their figure 1 ) ,    * if a seyfert 2 nucleus is powered by starbursts , strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission will be detected at 3.3 @xmath0 m regardless of dust extinction . *",
    "if it is powered by obscured agn activity , a carbonaceous dust absorption feature will be detected at 3.4 @xmath0 m . *",
    "if it is powered by weakly obscured agn activity , the 34 @xmath0 m spectrum will be nearly featureless .",
    "* if it is a composite of starburst and agn activity , the absolute luminosity and the equivalent width of the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission feature will be smaller than in starburst galaxies , so that these values can be used to quantitatively estimate the energetic importance of starburst activity .",
    "since the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission is intrinsically strong @xcite , even the signatures of weak starbursts are detectable ; even if only @xmath210 % of the observed nuclear 34 @xmath0 m flux originates in starbursts , the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission peak is @xmath220 % higher than the continuum level , and thus is clearly recognizable in normal s / n @xmath2 1520 spectra . additionally , the effects of dust extinction are smaller at 34 @xmath0 m than at shorter wavelengths , which makes the uncertainties in the dust extinction correction factor much smaller .",
    "this advantage is demonstrated quantitatively below .",
    "suppose that the dust extinction in starbursts is found to be a@xmath3 = 24 mag , with an uncertainty of a factor of 2 in a@xmath3 .",
    "since the dust extinction in the uv ( @xmath22000  ) is @xmath22.5 @xmath4 a@xmath3 @xcite , the corresponding dust extinction correction factor in the uv is 10010000 , differing by a factor of 100 depending on the adopted a@xmath3 .",
    "the difference becomes even larger if we go to shorter - wavelength parts of the uv region or if the actual dust extinction is larger .",
    "in contrast , since the dust extinction at 34 @xmath0 m is @xmath20.05 @xmath4 a@xmath3 @xcite , the extinction correction factor at 34 @xmath0 m in the case of a@xmath3 = 24 mag is 1.11.2 .",
    "thus , the extinction correction is negligible at 34 @xmath0 m , and the uncertainty in the correction factor is only at the 10% level .",
    "the high detectability of weak starbursts and the small uncertainties in dust extinction correction at 34 @xmath0 m combine to make 34 @xmath0 m observations a very powerful tool to quantitatively address the issue of the energetics of compact nuclear starbursts in seyfert 2 nuclei .",
    "this paper reports the results of 34 @xmath0 m spectroscopy of seyfert 2 nuclei and their implications for the energetics of these objects . throughout the paper , @xmath5 @xmath6 75 km s@xmath7",
    "mpc@xmath7 , @xmath8 = 0.3 , and @xmath9 = 0.7 are adopted .",
    "the seyfert 2 nuclei studied by @xcite and @xcite are selected in order to be able to compare our diagnostic results at 34 @xmath0 m directly with those previously obtained in the uv , optical , and @xmath1-band .",
    "our particular interests are ( 1 ) to assess the quantitative reliability of the extinction correction factor based on the uv data @xcite , ( 2 ) to make quantitative the optically based qualitative arguments on the magnitudes of compact nuclear starbursts @xcite , and ( 3 ) to find weak compact nuclear starbursts whose presence may have been missed with @xmath1-band diagnostics @xcite .",
    "the observed sources and their properties are summarized in table  [ tbl-1 ] .    due to our observing date ( table 2 ) , the observed seyfert 2 nuclei have right ascensions ( r.a . ) of between 7 and 16 hr .",
    "all eight seyfert 2 nuclei in this r.a .",
    "range in table 1 of @xcite are observed .",
    "@xcite explicitly presented the strength of the corrected co indices , after subtracting agn emission , in their table 5 . in total , there are eight seyfert 2 nuclei ( seyfert type 1.52.0 ) in the above r.a .",

    "ngc 5929 was in the sample of @xcite , leaving seven independent seyfert 2 nuclei .",
    "we attempted to observe all seven of these objects during our observing run , but could not observe ugc 6100 .",
    "we started observations on mrk 270 and mrk 461 , but based on the first few frames , found that these objects were too faint to obtain spectra of sufficient quality in a reasonable integration time ; we therefore discontinued the observations .",
    "thus , four out of the seven seyfert 2 nuclei in table 5 of ivanov et al . were observed .",
    "additionally , a 34 @xmath0 m spectrum of the very bright seyfert 2 nucleus ngc 1068 ( r.a .",

    ", some bias might be present , since seyfert 2 galaxies that are faint at 34 @xmath0 m have been excluded . nevertheless , our 34 @xmath0 m study of these seyfert 2 nuclei can provide useful information on the issue of the energetics of compact nuclear starbursts in seyfert 2 nuclei .",
    "an observing log is tabulated in table  [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "details of the observations of ngc 1068 were described by @xcite , and are not repeated here .",
    "the nsfcam grism mode @xcite at irtf on mauna kea , hawaii , was used to obtain 34 @xmath0 m spectra of all the seyfert 2 galaxies except mrk 273 , mrk 463 , and ngc 1068 .",
    "the _ hkl _",
    "grism and _ l _ blocker were used with the 4 pixel wide slit (= 1@xmath10 ) .",
    "the resulting spectral resolution was @xmath2150 at 3.5 @xmath0 m .",
    "mrk 273 and mrk 463 were observed with the cgs4 ( mountain et al .",

    "sky conditions were photometric throughout the observations .",
    "seeing sizes were 0@xmath1160@xmath119 ( full width at half maximum ) for both the irtf and ukirt observing runs .",
    "spectra were obtained toward the flux peak at 34 @xmath0 m . for sources observed with nsfcam , the position angles of the slit were set along the north - south direction .",
    "consequently , for mrk 266 , which has two nuclei lying on a southwest to northeast axis , only the southwest seyfert 2 nucleus ( mrk 266sw ; mazzarella & boroson 1993 ) was observed . for mrk 273 and",
    "mrk 463 , which were observed with cgs4 , the position angles were set at 35@xmath12 and 90@xmath12 east of north , respectively , so as to observe simultaneously emission from both the double nuclei with a separation of less than 5 arcsec @xcite .",
    "a standard telescope nodding technique with a throw of 12 arcsec was employed along the slit to subtract background emission . since 34 @xmath0 m emission from seyfert 2 galaxies",
    "is usually dominated by compact nuclear emission @xcite , this throw is believed to be sufficiently large .",
    "offset guide stars were used whenever available to achieve high telescope tracking accuracy . for mrk 463 ,",
    "the 34 @xmath0 m emission was dominated by the eastern nucleus ( mrk 463e ) so that the obtained spectrum is almost equivalent to that of mrk 463e only . for mrk 273 ,",
    "the double nuclei were not clearly resolvable and so emission from both nuclei was combined to produce a single spectrum .",
    "f- to g - type standard stars and one b - type star ( table  [ tbl-2 ] ) were observed with almost the same airmass as individual seyfert 2 nuclei , to correct for the transmission of the earth s atmosphere .",
    "the @xmath13-band ( 3.5 @xmath0 m ) magnitudes of standard stars were estimated from their @xmath14-band ( 0.6 @xmath0 m ) magnitudes , by adopting the @xmath15 colors appropriate to the stellar types of individual standard stars ( tokunaga 2000 ) .",
    "standard data analysis procedures were employed within iraf .",
    "first , bad pixels were replaced with the interpolated values of the surrounding pixels .",
    "next , bias was subtracted from the obtained frames and the frames were divided by a flat image .",
    "the spectra of the targets and the standard stars were then extracted .",
    "spectra were extracted by integrating signals over 410 arcsec along the slit ( table  [ tbl-3 ] ) , depending on the spatial extent of the actual 34 @xmath0 m signals .",
    "for nsfcam data , wavelength calibration was performed using the wavelength - dependent transmission of the earth s atmosphere , while an argon lamp was used for the cgs4 data .",
    "the spectra of seyfert 2 nuclei were divided by those of the standard stars , and multiplied by the spectra of blackbodies with temperatures corresponding to individual standard stars ( table  [ tbl-2 ] ) . after flux calibration based on the adopted standard star fluxes , the final spectra were produced .",
    "nsfcam data at @xmath23.35 @xmath0 m for some sources are contaminated by an uncorrectable ghost image , and so these data points were removed .",
    "flux - calibrated spectra are shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the spectra of faint sources have been binned by a few spectral elements .",
    "the 34 @xmath0 m spectra of ngc 1068 and mrk 273 , previously presented by @xcite and @xcite respectively , are shown again here .    the possible energy sources for seyfert 2 galaxies are agn , compact ( less than a few 100 pc ) nuclear starbursts @xcite , and extended ( kpc scale ) star - formation in the host galaxies .",
    "the employed slit width of 1@xmath112 ( except for ngc 1068 ) corresponds to the physical scale of 7090 pc and 1.1 kpc for the nearest ( ngc 3227 and ngc 5033 ; @xmath16 0.004 ) and farthest ( mrk 34 and mrk 463 ; _ z _ = 0.051 ) sources , respectively",
    ". therefore , except in ngc 3227 and ngc 5033 , the bulk of the compact ( less than a few 100 pc ) nuclear starburst emission is covered by our observations .",
    "although extended ( 410 arcsec ) emission along the slit direction is also included in our spectroscopy , the fraction of the extended emission inside this thin strip is negligible compared to the whole .",
    "therefore , the emission directly investigated based on our slit spectra is that due to agn and compact nuclear starburst activity , and the contamination of the emission from extended ( kpc scale ) star - formation activity is negligible .",
    "the slit widths employed for the uv , optical , and @xmath1-band observations are 1@xmath1121@xmath117 @xcite , so that these spectra also reflect the properties of the agn and compact nuclear starburst emission .",
    "thus , our 34 @xmath0 m slit spectra can be directly compared with uv , optical , and @xmath1-band spectra to investigate the nature of agn and compact nuclear starbursts .    the bulk of the agn and compact nuclear starburst emission is , in principle , detectable in the slit .",
    "however , some flux from the compact emission could be lost in our slit spectra if the telescope tracking accuracy were insufficient .",
    "34 @xmath0 m emission from seyfert 2 galaxies is generally dominated by compact nuclear emission @xcite . thus , table  [ tbl-3 ] compares our spectro - photometric magnitudes with photometry at 34 @xmath0 m made with apertures of 39 arcsec in the literature , in order to estimate what fraction of compact nuclear 34 @xmath0 m emission may have been missed .",
    "( we note , however , that time variability of the nuclear 34 @xmath0 m emission may affect the comparison . ) in table  [ tbl-3 ] , our slit spectrum gives a magnitude 1.2 mag fainter than the aperture photometry for ngc 5033 .",
    "this is the closest source in our sample , so that it is quite plausible that a significant fraction of the 34 @xmath0 m continuum emission has been missed in this object .",
    "however , since ngc 5033 is not used in the systematic discussion ( @xmath17 5 ) , this missing flux for ngc 5033 will not have a significant effect on our main conclusions . with the exception of ngc 5033 ,",
    "the magnitude difference is less than 0.8 mag , or a factor of less than @xmath22 in all cases .",
    "this agreement within a factor of less than 2 implies that our slit spectroscopy detects at least half of the compact nuclear emission ; given that aperture photometry may contain a contribution from extended emission , the actual slit loss for the compact nuclear emission is even smaller .",
    "therefore , as far as the compact nuclear emission is concerned , the absolute 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission fluxes measured with our slit spectra should be certain within a factor of less than 2 .    to estimate the flux , luminosity , and rest - frame equivalent width of the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission , the spectral profile of type-1 sources @xcite",
    "is adopted as a template of the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission .",
    "this profile can fit well the observed 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission in some starbursts with spectra of high spectral resolution and high signal - to - noise ratios at @xmath23.3 @xmath0 m ( e.g. , ngc 253 and arp 220 in imanishi & dudley 2000 ; mrk 266sw in fig.1 ) .",
    "the rest - frame peak wavelength of the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission is assumed to be 3.29 @xmath0 m , and only the normalization is treated as a free parameter .",
    "the best linear fit for the data points which are affected by neither emission nor absorption is used as a continuum level .",
    "several different continuum levels are adopted , and the uncertainties of the pah fluxes ( luminosities , equivalent widths ) resulting from the continuum ambiguity are also taken into account , particularly for sources with small pah equivalent widths .",
    "the estimated values are summarized in table  [ tbl-4 ] .    if dust grains in the obscuring material of seyfert 2 nuclei are covered with an ice mantle , strong h@xmath18o ice absorption should be detected @xcite .",
    "this absorption feature has a peak wavelength of 3.08 @xmath0 m and is spectrally broad , extending from 2.8 to 3.6 @xmath0 m ( e.g. , smith , sellgren , & tokunaga 1989 ) .",
    "the estimates of the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah fluxes could be highly uncertain if the absorption is strong .",
    "however , most of our spectra cover 3.08 @xmath0 m in the rest - frame , and yet no sign of strong h@xmath18o ice absorption is found .",
    "the average spectrum of seyfert 2 galaxies @xcite show no clear h@xmath18o absorption feature either .",
    "since the absorption strength is much weaker at @xmath193.25 @xmath0 m than at 3.08 @xmath0 m @xcite , possible presence of currently undetectable , weak h@xmath18o absorption in seyfert 2 nuclei is unlikely to affect the estimates of the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission significantly .",
    "the fraction of the observed nuclear 34 @xmath0 m fluxes in our slit spectra that originates in starbursts can be estimated from the rest - frame equivalent widths of the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission feature ( ew@xmath20 ) .",
    "the ew@xmath20 value decreases as the agn contribution increases ( @xmath17 1 ) .",
    "the equivalent widths for starburst - dominated galaxies are @xmath2120 nm @xcite . in table",
    "[ tbl-4 ] , only mrk 266sw shows an ew@xmath20 value similar to those of starburst galaxies ; we can conclude from this that only the observed nuclear 34 @xmath0 m flux of mrk 266sw is dominated by starbursts .",
    "mrk 78 , mrk 273 , mrk 477 , ngc 3227 , and ngc 5135 all show detectable , moderately strong 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission features , but their ew@xmath20 values are a factor 39 smaller than those of starburst galaxies .",
    "for these five sources , starbursts contribute some fraction , but less than half , of the observed nuclear 34 @xmath0 m fluxes , and the bulk of the observed 34 @xmath0 m fluxes originate in agn activity . for the remaining seven seyfert 2 nuclei ( ic 3639 , mrk 34 , mrk 463 ,",
    "mrk 686 , ngc 1068 , ngc 5033 , and ngc 5929 ) , the ew@xmath20 is more than a factor of 7 smaller than that expected for starburst - dominated galaxies , indicating that the predominant fraction ( larger than 80% ) of their 34 @xmath0 m emission comes from agn activity . _",
    "our first conclusion is that , except in the case of mrk 266sw , the observed compact nuclear 34 @xmath0 m emission is dominated by the agn and not by starbursts_.    this result has implications for infrared studies of agns .",
    "@xmath13- ( 3.5 @xmath0 m ) and @xmath21-band ( 4.8 @xmath0 m ) emission from agns is usually dominated by compact emission , and photometric data at these bands are used to discuss dust obscuration toward agns , on the assumption that this compact emission comes predominantly from the agn and not from compact nuclear starbursts @xcite .",
    "our results provide supporting evidence for this assumption .",
    "the 3.4 @xmath0 m carbonaceous dust absorption feature is detected in mrk 463 and ngc 1068 .",
    "the observed 3.4 @xmath0 m absorption optical depths are @xmath22(observed ) @xmath6 0.042@xmath230.005 and 0.12@xmath230.01 for mrk 463 and ngc 1068 , respectively . in agns , the 34 @xmath0 m continuum emission is dominated by dust in thermal equilibrium with a temperature of 8001000k , close to the dust sublimation temperature , located at the innermost part of the dusty torus @xcite .",
    "the dust extinction toward the 34 @xmath0 m continuum emitting region is thus almost the same as that toward the agn itself . assuming a galactic dust model ( @xmath22/a@xmath3 @xmath6 0.0040.007 ; pendleton et al .",
    "1994 ) , the dust extinction toward the agns is estimated to be 611 and 1730 mag for mrk 463 and ngc 1068 , respectively .",
    "mrk 463 shows a broad emission component in its near - infrared hydrogen recombination lines @xcite so that dust obscuration toward the agn has been suggested to be relatively modest in this object .",

    "the dust absorption feature is smeared out if less obscured starburst emission contributes significantly to the observed nuclear 34 @xmath0 m flux @xcite .",
    "the six sources with detectable pah emission ( mrk 78 , mrk 266sw , mrk 273 , mrk 477 , ngc 3227 , and ngc 5135 ) could be this case .",

    "the signatures of compact nuclear starbursts may have been missed during the complicated procedures required to find their weak signatures in the @xmath1-band @xcite .",
    "since the observed nuclear 34 @xmath0 m emission is dominated by agn activity ( @xmath17 5.1 ) , it would be expected that agn activity also contributes much more than compact nuclear starbursts to the net galactic infrared ( 81000 @xmath0 m ) luminosities of seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "however , the agn - driven infrared luminosities of these objects are difficult to estimate because they are highly dependent on the spatial distribution of dust in the dusty torus , which is poorly constrained observationally .",

    "@xcite have presented _ iso _",
    "2.511 @xmath0 m spectra taken with 24 @xmath4 24 arcsec@xmath34 apertures , and quote pah fluxes for four sources ( mrk 266 , ngc 3227 , ngc 5033 , and ngc 5929 ) . for these sources , the energetic importance of extended star - formation activity can be investigated by comparing the measured pah fluxes in our slit spectra with those in the _ iso _ spectra .",
    "the effects of dust extinction are similar at 38 @xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "the 7.7 @xmath0 m pah emission is the strongest pah emission feature .",
    "however , its flux estimates in the _ iso _ spectra may be highly uncertain @xcite , due to the presence of strong , spectrally broad 9.7 @xmath0 m silicate dust absorption feature and insufficient wavelength coverage longward of these emission and absorption features , which make a continuum determination difficult @xcite .",
    "quantitatively reliable flux estimates of the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission in the _ iso _ spectra are also difficult due to the scatter in the data points at 34 @xmath0 m ( clavel et al .",
    "2000 , their figure 8) .",
    "consequently , the 6.2 @xmath0 m pah emission , which is isolated and moderately strong , is most suitable to investigate the extended star - formation activity based on the _ iso _ spectra @xcite .",
    "the 6.2 @xmath0 m pah to infrared luminosity ratios ( l@xmath35/l@xmath29 ) for starbursts are estimated to be @xmath2 6 @xmath4 10@xmath27 , with a scatter of a factor of 23 toward both higher and lower values @xcite , where it is assumed that l@xmath29 @xmath2 l@xmath26 for starbursts .",
    "the respective l@xmath35/l@xmath29 ratios are 4 @xmath4 10@xmath27 , 4 @xmath4 10@xmath27 , 3 @xmath4 10 @xmath27 , and 1 @xmath4 10@xmath27 , for mrk 266 , ngc 3227 , ngc 5033 , and ngc 5929 @xcite , roughly half of ( mrk 266 , ngc 3227 , and ngc 5033 ) or more than six times smaller than ( ngc 5929 ) the typical value for systems dominated by starbursts .",
    "since the observed l@xmath20/l@xmath29 ratios indicate that the compact nuclear starbursts energetically fall short of the total infrared luminosities by a factor of larger than 6 for these four sources ( table  [ tbl-4 ] ) , it can be said that extended star - formation ( but not compact nuclear starbursts ) contributes significantly to the infrared luminosities of these seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "this statement was made by @xcite for seyfert galaxies as a whole based on the 7.7 @xmath0 m pah emission .",
    "based on the 6.2 @xmath0 m pah emission , here , it has been confirmed that this is true also for the four individual seyfert 2 galaxies , and probably for seyfert 2 galaxies as a whole .",
    "the individual l@xmath35/l@xmath29 ratios for mrk 266 , ngc 3227 , and ngc 5033 are within the scattered range of the ratios for starbursts .",
    "however , the overall trend of lower values implies that agn activity also makes an important contribution to the infrared luminosities of seyfert 2 galaxies .      while both starbursts and quiescent disk star - formation in normal galaxies can produce pah emission ( @xmath17 5.5 ) , strong soft x - ray emission driven by superwind",
    "is observed only if the star - formation rate per unit area exceeds a certain threshold ( 10@xmath7 m@xmath36 yr@xmath7 kpc@xmath37 ; heckman 2000 ) .",
    "starbursts surpass this threshold , while quiescent normal disk star - formation does not @xcite .",
    "these different characteristics can be used to understand the properties of energetically significant extended star - formation activity .    of the 13 seyfert 2 galaxies ,",
    "@xcite have estimated superwind - driven soft x - ray luminosities for eight sources ( ic 3639 , mrk 78 , mrk 266 , mrk 273 , mrk 463 , mrk 477 , ngc 1068 , and ngc 5135 ) , and found that , as a whole , their soft x - ray to far - infrared luminosity ratios are as high as those of starburst galaxies .",
    "therefore , starburst activity is a significant contributor to the far - infrared emission and also to the infrared dust emission . since compact nuclear starbursts detected in our slit spectra",
    "were found to be energetically insignificant ( @xmath17 5.3 ) , the energetically significant starbursts must be extended .",
    "_ our third conclusion is that the bulk of the energetically significant extended ( kpc scale ) star - formation activity is of starburst - type and not quiescent normal disk star - formation .",
    "it is the extended ( kpc scale ) starbursts , rather than the compact ( less than a few 100 pc ) nuclear starbursts , that are responsible for the superwind - driven soft x - ray emission . _",
    "if starbursts are inevitable phenomena in seyfert 2 galaxies , their extended starburst activity is energetically more important than their compact nuclear starbursts .",

    "<S> we report on 34 @xmath0 m slit spectroscopy of 13 seyfert 2 nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the 3.3 @xmath0 m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission is used to estimate the magnitudes of compact nuclear starbursts ( on scales less than a few 100 pc ) and to resolve the controversy over their energetic importance in seyfert 2 nuclei . for three selected seyfert 2 nuclei that have been well studied in the uv , </S>",
    "<S> the magnitudes of the compact nuclear starbursts estimated from the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission ( with no extinction correction ) are in satisfactory quantitative agreement with those based on the uv after extinction correction . </S>",
    "<S> this agreement indicates that the flux attenuation of compact nuclear starburst emission due to dust extinction is insignificant at 34 @xmath0 m , and thus allows us to use the observed 3.3 @xmath0 m pah luminosity to estimate the magnitudes of the compact nuclear starbursts in seyfert 2 nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> based directly on our 34 @xmath0 m slit spectra , the following two main conclusions are drawn : ( 1 ) except in one case , the observed nuclear 34 @xmath0 m emission is dominated by agn and not by starbursts , and ( 2 ) compact nuclear starbursts are detected in 6 out of 13 seyfert 2 nuclei , but can not dominate the energetics of the galactic infrared dust emission in the majority of the observed seyfert 2 galaxies . for several sources for which infrared space observatory spectra taken with larger apertures and/or soft x - ray data are available , these data are combined with our 34 @xmath0 m slit spectra , and it is suggested that ( 3 ) extended ( kpc scale ) star - formation activity is energetically more important than compact nuclear starbursts , and contributes significantly to the infrared luminosities of seyfert 2 galaxies , although the agn is still an important contributor to the luminosities , and ( 4 ) the bulk of the energetically significant extended star - formation activity is of starburst type rather than quiescent normal disk star - formation ; the extended starbursts are responsible for the superwind - driven soft x - ray emission from seyfert 2 galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> finally , a correlation between the luminosities of agns and compact nuclear starbursts is implied ; more powerful agns tend to be related to more powerful compact nuclear starbursts . </S>"
