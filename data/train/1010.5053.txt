    "the isospin - symmetry violation in atomic nuclei is predominantly due to the coulomb interaction that exerts long - range polarizations on neutron and proton states . to consistently take into account this polarization",
    ", one needs to employ huge configuration spaces .",
    "for that reason , an accurate description of isospin impurities in atomic nuclei , which is strongly motivated by the recent high - precision measurements of the @xmath3 fermi superallowed @xmath0-decay rates , is difficult to be obtained in shell - model approaches , and specific approximate methods are required.@xcite    the long - range polarization effects can be included within the self - consistent mean - field ( mf ) or dft approaches , which are practically the only microscopic frameworks available for heavy , open - shell nuclei with many valence particles .",
    "these approaches , however , apart from the _ physical _ contribution to the isospin mixing , mostly caused by the coulomb field and , to a much lesser extent , by isospin - non - invariant components of the nucleon - nucleon force , also introduce the spurious isospin mixing due to the _ spontaneous _ isospin - symmetry breaking.@xcite    hereby , we present results on the isospin mixing and isospin symmetry - breaking corrections to the superallowed fermi @xmath0-decay obtained by using the newly developed isospin- and angular - momentum - projected dft approach without pairing.@xcite the model employs symmetry - restoration techniques to remove the spurious isospin components and restore angular momentum symmetry , and takes advantage of the natural ability of mf to describe self - consistently the subtle balance between the coulomb force making proton and neutron wave functions different and the isoscalar part of the strong interaction producing the opposite effect .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "the building block of the isospin - projected dft is the slater determinant , @xmath4 , representing the self - consistent skyrme - hf solution provided by the hf solver hfodd.@xcite self - consistency ensures that the balance between the long - range coulomb force and short - range strong interaction , represented in our model by the skyrme energy density functional ( edf ) , are properly taken into account .",
    "the unphysical isospin mixing is taken care of by the rediagonalization of the entire hamiltonian in the good isospin basis , @xmath5 , as described in refs.@xcite this yields the eigenstates : @xmath6 numbered by an index @xmath7 .",

    "this fact narrows the applicability of the model to hamiltonian - driven edfs which , for skyrme - type functionals , leaves only one option : the sv parametrization.@xcite the alternative would be to use an appropriate regularization scheme , which is currently under development.@xcite",

    "as is well known,@xcite isospin impurities are the largest in @xmath1 nuclei , increase along the @xmath1 line with increasing proton number , and are strongly quenched with increasing @xmath31 .",
    "such characteristics were also early estimated based on the perturbation theory@xcite or hydrodynamical model.@xcite quantitatively , after getting rid of the spurious mixing , which lowers the true @xmath30 by as much as 30%,@xcite the isospin impurity increases from a fraction of a percent in very light @xmath1 nuclei to @xmath320.9% in @xmath27ca , and @xmath326.0% in @xmath28sn , as shown in fig .",

    "this correction is obtained by calculating the @xmath40 fermi matrix element of the isospin raising / lowering operator @xmath41 between the ground state ( g.s . ) of the even - even nucleus @xmath42 and its isospin - analogue partner in the @xmath1 odd - odd nucleus , @xmath43 : @xmath44    to determine the @xmath45 state in the odd - odd @xmath1 nucleus , we first compute the so - called antialigned g.s .  configuration , @xmath46 ( or @xmath47 ) , by placing the odd neutron and the odd proton in the lowest available time - reversed ( or signature - reversed ) hf orbits .",
    "then , to correct for the fact that the antialigned configurations manifestly break the isospin symmetry,@xcite that is , @xmath48 , we apply the isospin and angular - momentum projections to create the basis @xmath49 , in which the total hamiltonian is rediagonalized ( see sec .",

    "a similar scheme is used to compute the @xmath42 states in the even - even nuclei .",
    "our studies indicate@xcite that to obtain a fair estimate of @xmath38 for @xmath50 and @xmath51 nuclei , one needs to use large harmonic oscillator bases consisting of at least @xmath52 and 12 full shells , respectively .",
    "even then , the results are subject to systematic errors due to the basis cut - off , which can be estimated to be @xmath3210% . despite the fact that not all @xmath53 calculations in heavy ( @xmath54 ) nuclei have yet been completed , and that owing to the shape - coexistence effects , there are still some ambiguities concerning the global minima , our preliminary results point to encouraging conclusions .",
    "namely , the mean value of the structure - independent statistical - rate function @xmath55,@xcite obtained for 12 out of 13 transitions known empirically with high precision ( excluding the @xmath56k@xmath57@xmath56ar case ) , equals @xmath58 , which gives the value of the ckm matrix element equal to @xmath59 .",
    "these values match well those obtained by towner and hardy in their recent compilation@xcite ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) . because of a poor spectroscopic quality of the sv parameterization , the confidence level@xcite of our results is poor .",

    "the similarity of the calculated energy splittings shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] confirms that this quantity primarily depends on the isovector terms of the functional .",
