    "<S> the spin field effect transistor envisioned by datta and das@xcite opens a gateway to spin information processing@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although the coherent manipulation of electron spins in semiconductors is now possible@xcite , the realization of a functional spin field effect transistor for information processing has yet to be achieved , owing to several fundamental challenges such as the low spin - injection efficiency due to resistance mismatch@xcite , spin relaxation , and the spread of spin precession angles . </S>",
    "<S> alternative spin transistor designs have therefore been proposed@xcite , but these differ from the field effect transistor concept and require the use of optical or magnetic elements , which pose difficulties for the incorporation into integrated circuits . here , </S>",
    "<S> we present an all - electric and all - semiconductor spin field effect transistor , in which these obstacles are overcome by employing two quantum point contacts as spin injectors and detectors . distinct engineering architectures of spin - orbit coupling are exploited for the quantum point contacts and the central semiconductor channel to achieve complete control of the electron spins  </S>",

    "<S> spin - orbit ( so ) coupling  the interaction between a particle s spin and its motion  can be appreciated in the framework of an effective magnetic field @xmath0 , which acts on charged particles when they move in an electric field @xmath1 and is described by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is planck s constant divided by @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the speed of light , @xmath6 is the particle s wavevector , and @xmath7 is its mass . in semiconductor heterostructures , the electric field which gives rise to @xmath0 can be created by breaking the structural inversion symmetry in the material , namely , the rashba so coupling@xcite . moreover , this electric field can easily be varied using metallic gates@xcite , thus controlling @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> such an effective magnetic field creates a link between the magnetic moment of the particle ( spin ) and the electric field acting upon it , offering a route for fast and coherent electrical control of spin states . while the so coupling has been utilized for spin manipulation , approaches to spin injection and detection still rely on ferromagnetic and/or optical components , and the demonstration of an all - electric spin transistor device has remained elusive .    . </S>",
    "<S> the injected spins , polarized along the @xmath8 axis , move ballistically and precess about the @xmath9 axis in the region between the two qpcs . </S>",
    "<S> the precession originates from a distinct so effective field @xmath10 which is defined and controlled by the structural inversion asymmetry of the 2deg channel and the middle gate ( m ) voltage . </S>",

    "<S> an ingaas heterostructure ( see methods summary ) , one of the strong contenders to replace si in future generations of large - scale integrated circuits ( see _ international technology roadmap for semiconductors _ ; http://public.itrs.net ) , is used to provide a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) channel for ballistic electron transport under a metallic middle gate and between two gate - defined quantum point contacts ( qpcs ) . </S>",
    "<S> the qpcs are narrow and short one - dimensional ( 1d ) constrictions , usually formed by applying voltages to split gates patterned on the surface of a semiconductor heterostructure . </S>",
    "<S> although the geometry is extremely simple , the qpc contains rich physics@xcite and has been suggested to generate a completely spin - polarized current due to so coupling and/or electron - electron interaction@xcite .    in this all - electric spin fet , </S>",
    "<S> the left ( right ) qpc acts as a spin injector ( detector ) with nearly @xmath14 efficiency . to utilize the qpcs as spin injectors / detectors </S>",
    "<S> , we set a difference between the voltages on either side of the split gate ( i.e. @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the voltages applied respectively to the gate l1 and l2 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1a ,  b ) to generate a lateral inversion asymmetry and consequently a lateral so effective magnetic field , @xmath18 , on electrons moving within the 1d constriction . </S>",
    "<S> the orientation of @xmath18 is along the @xmath8 axis , perpendicular to the lateral electric field and the electron momentum direction . </S>",
    "<S> such a lateral so coupling lifts the spin degeneracy and results in two spin - polarized 1d subbands shifted in wavevector as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1c . in the case where the fermi energy @xmath11 is tuned below the crossing point between two spin - polarized subbands , </S>",
    "<S> the left- and right - moving 1d electrons are both fully spin - polarized@xcite in the positive and negative @xmath8-direction , respectively ( hereafter , we refer to these subbands as the spin - up and spin - down states ) , thereby allowing the qpc to act as a spin injector / detector . </S>",
    "<S> recent studies@xcite have further suggested that this lateral so - induced spin splitting could be greatly enhanced by the strong electron - electron interaction in 1d systems ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1d ) , making the qpc spin injector / detector more reliable ( see supplementary section 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this method of spin injection circumvents many of the technical problems faced by ferromagnetic or optical alternatives ( such as low spin - injection efficiency@xcite and scalability ) , and is compatible with the current manufacturing technology of fets .    </S>",
    "<S> the spins supplied from the qpc injector remain ballistic and experience a so effective magnetic field , @xmath19 , in the 2deg channel due to the structural inversion asymmetry of the quantum well , which can be further controlled by changing the voltage applied to the middle gate ( @xmath20 ) . in this transport channel </S>",
    "<S> the orientation of @xmath19 is parallel to the @xmath9 axis , and therefore perpendicular to the so field @xmath18 in the qpc injector . </S>",
    "<S> this causes the injected spins to precess during transport between the qpcs ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1a ) . </S>",
    "<S> by modifying the gate voltage @xmath20 to vary @xmath10 , one can control the spin orientation of electrons travelling along the channel . </S>",
    "<S> the charge current is therefore modulated by the spin precession angle : electrons can pass through the qpc detector if their spin rotates to become parallel to the polarization direction , and can not if their spin is anti - parallel . </S>",
    "<S> this gives rise to an oscillatory on / off switching with respect to gate voltage @xmath20 .     </S>",
    "<S> ( which controls the spin precession frequency ) measured at @xmath21  mk and @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 ) . the oscillating current modulation occurs when a voltage difference @xmath24  v is applied to the qpcs ( black trace ) . </S>",
    "<S> the lateral asymmetry of the qpc confinement potential results in a lateral so effective field @xmath18 on electrons moving within the 1d channel , and hence the qpcs acts as spin injectors / detectors when operated near threshold ( see bottom inset , schematic of the spin fet ) . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillation disappears at @xmath25 ( red trace ) , where the lateral so effective field is absent , @xmath26 , and both spin species can pass through the qpcs ( see top inset ) . </S>",
    "<S> data are vertically offset by @xmath27  @xmath28v for clarity . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the operation of our spin fet in fig .  2 . </S>",
    "<S> here , in order to simultaneously measure the on / off switching functionality and have precise control of the conductance of the qpcs , we configured the qpc detector as a voltage probe and measured the voltage across it . </S>",
    "<S> this voltage corresponds to the current flowing directly from the injector into the detector ( see methods summary ) , i.e. , the switching current in the spin fet . </S>",
    "<S> the conductance values of both qpcs are just above the threshold for conduction set at @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 is the electron charge ) , at which the fermi level is slightly above the very bottom of the spin - polarized 1d subbands to generate a spin polarized current in the presence of @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> when both qpcs are brought into the spin - polarized state by electrically introducing a lateral inversion asymmetry ( black trace ; @xmath24  v where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the split gate voltages ) , an oscillatory on / off switching with variation as high as @xmath34 is observed as a function of @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> such a large oscillating change in the conductance modulation ( due to @xmath0 and spin precession ) is about @xmath35 times greater than that observed in a conventional 2d spin fet design@xcite which suffers from low signal levels as a result of the limited spin - injection efficiency , the short spin lifetime , and the spread of spin precession angles .    </S>",
    "<S> the voltage oscillation disappears when the lateral inversion asymmetry is removed from the qpcs by setting @xmath36 ( red trace in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> spins injected from the qpc are no longer polarized along the @xmath8 axis as @xmath37 , and thus no oscillations in current are detected . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that the experimental results presented here , in addition to showing the realization of spin fets , provide the first direct evidence of spin polarization of qpcs at zero external magnetic field .     at various @xmath38 values , ranging from @xmath39 to @xmath40 , while @xmath41 is fixed at @xmath42  k. data are vertically offset by @xmath27  @xmath28v for clarity . * </S>",
    "<S> b * , same as * a * for various temperatures ranging from @xmath42 to @xmath43  k , for @xmath44 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> figure  3a shows the oscillating voltages when the injector and detector qpcs are set at various conductance values . in a simple model of 1d transport with so coupling ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1c ) , the right - moving electrons ( with @xmath12 wavevectors ) are fully spin - polarized at low conductance values when only the lowest spin - down subband is occupied . </S>",
    "<S> with increasing @xmath38 , the 1d subbands of both spin species become populated by electrons and the spin polarization decreases . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3a shows that the oscillation amplitude decreases with increasing @xmath38 , which is consistent with this model .    </S>",
    "<S> the influence of temperature on the oscillating voltage was also investigated ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3b ) . </S>",
    "<S> since momentum scattering plays a key role in randomizing the spin precession@xcite , in a collision - free regime the spin relaxation may be negligible . </S>",
    "<S> the use of qpcs in the spin fet device allows only the ballistic transport electrons that directly moves from the injector to the collector to contribute to the signal , thereby implying that the observed decrease of the oscillation amplitude mainly results from the thermal reduction of the qpc polarization efficiency rather than the spin relaxation during transport . </S>",
    "<S> it suggests that much higher working temperature of the spin fet could be achieved in the presence of a larger 1d spin splitting , perhaps using wet - etched qpcs@xcite or inas nanowires .     and magnetic field @xmath45 , obtained in a different cooldown to data in fig . 2 and 3 . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed lines show the calculated positions of oscillation peaks ( i.e. , the spin precession angle @xmath46 ) , in good quantitative agreement with the experiments . * b * , experimental data of the oscillating voltage at @xmath47 ( black trace ) and its fit using eq . 1 in cosine form ( red trace ) . * c * , the so coupling variation @xmath48 as a function of gate voltage @xmath20 , obtained from the fit in * b*. note that the analysis of spin precession with respect to @xmath20 can only provide the absolute value of @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the interplay between the external field and the rashba so field on spin precession in * a * can be used to verify the direction of the rashba so field , showing @xmath50 is a negative value and decreases with creasing @xmath20 , where @xmath51 is a baseline value of the rashba so coupling constant . ]    finally , we demonstrate simultaneous electrical and magnetic control of spin precession . </S>",
    "<S> earlier studies have shown that the spin precession can be driven either by the electric - field - tunable rashba field@xcite @xmath52 or by an external magnetic field@xcite @xmath45 . here </S>",

    "<S> the external field @xmath45 was applied parallel to @xmath10 , both along the @xmath9 axis . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results reveal the interplay of the electric and magnetic fields on spin precession , showing voltage oscillations along both @xmath20 and @xmath45 axes . </S>",

    "<S> a quasi-1d spin fet is anticipated to have better performance than its 2d alternatives because the current modulation due to spin precession in 2d transport is expected to be washed out by the spread of precession angles@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is because carriers with different injection angles travel different distances between the source and drain electrodes , thereby gaining a variety of spin precession angles when they reach the drain . </S>",
    "<S> the qpcs  in addition to providing spin selection with nearly @xmath14 efficiency and allowing only ballistic transport electrons to be collected ( to sidestep the obstacles of low injection efficiency and spin relaxation)define a quasi-1d path between the injector and detector to eliminate the phase spread , which results in a large oscillating signal modulation in the spin fet . on the basis of device functionality and application aspects , </S>",
