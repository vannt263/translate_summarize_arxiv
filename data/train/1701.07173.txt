    "the study of @xmath1 meson decays and mixing can provide some useful information with respect to flavor mixing and @xmath10 asymmetries  @xcite .",
    "the two - body nonleptonic decays of @xmath1 mesons can be classified into three types : cabibbo - favored ( cf ) , singly cabibbo - suppressed ( scs ) , and doubly cabibbo - suppressed ( dcs ) processes . in the standard model ( sm )",
    ", they are respectively corresponding to the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 with the wolfenstein parameter @xmath14 and @xmath15 as the cabibbo angle .",
    "unlike the cf and scs processes mostly observed in experiments , only a few dcs modes are well measured due to the relatively small branching fractions  @xcite .",
    "however , the studies on dcs processes have great interests . because of the relatively smallness in the sm",
    ", the dcs processes can be significantly affected by new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "for example , there would be new @xmath10 violating effects in the dcs processes in some new physics models , thereby affecting the determination of mixing parameters and indirect @xmath10 phases in the @xmath16 system @xcite . besides",
    ", the studies on dcs processes can help to test the flavor @xmath2 symmetry , understand the dynamics of charmed hadron decays and the mechanism of @xmath16 mixing @xcite .    among the dcs modes , the decaying of @xmath1 mesons into @xmath17 in the final states are actually involved in the processes with @xmath3 , which are however dominated by cf modes of @xmath1 decaying into @xmath18 .",
    "we can not distinguish the effects of cf and dcs amplitudes in the individual data of @xmath19 . in some literatures ,",
    "the decays with @xmath3 in the final states are always approximately considered as saturated by cf contributions , and hence the dcs information are neglected in such processes @xcite .    in the case of processes with neutral kaons ,",
    "it was firstly pointed out by bigi and yamamoto that the decay widths of modes with @xmath3 and @xmath4 should be different due to the effect of interference between the cf and dcs amplitudes @xcite .",
    "they proposed the observable of @xmath0 asymmetries to describe the difference between modes with @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "in the two - body decays of @xmath20 with @xmath21 as the other meson in the final state except for the neutral kaons , the @xmath0 asymmetries are defined by @xmath22 the non - vanishing values of @xmath23 would be induced by the interference between the decay amplitudes of @xmath24 ( cf transitions ) and @xmath25 ( dcs transitions ) .",
    "therefore , the determination on the @xmath0 asymmetries in @xmath1 decays can be useful to study the dcs processes .",
    "the asymmetries in @xmath26 decays have been measured by the cleo collaboration @xcite ] ] @xmath27    the @xmath0 asymmetries have been studied in the qcd factorization approach @xcite . however , since the charm quark mass is not heavy enough , the qcd - inspired methods , such as the qcd factorization approach @xcite , the perturbative qcd approach @xcite , and the soft - collinear effective theory @xcite , are not suitable for charmed hadron decays .",
    "the asymmetries are also predicted in the conventional topological diagrammatic approach under the @xmath2 flavor symmetry @xcite .",
    "but it is known that the @xmath2 breaking effects can be as large as @xmath28 in charm decays , so then have to be considered . in @xcite",
    ", the authors studied the @xmath0 asymmetries in the topological approach including linear @xmath2 breaking effects .",
    "since there are too many parameters in this method , the predictive power is limited .    in this work",
    ", we study the @xmath0 asymmetries in the factorization - assisted topological - amplitude ( fat ) approach @xcite , in which non - perturbative contributions are included and significant flavour @xmath2 symmetry breaking effects are well expressed .",
    "it has been manifested that the fat approach works well in @xmath1 meson decays .",
    "the results on branching fractions are consistent with experimental data in the @xmath1 decays into two pseudoscalar mesons ( @xmath29 ) , or one pseudoscalar meson and one vector meson @xmath30 .",
    "furthermore , the prediction on the @xmath10 asymmetry differences @xmath31 in the fat approach @xcite is verified by recent lhcb collaboration @xcite .",
    "the fat approach will be introduced in details in the following sections .    in this paper",
    ", we will study the @xmath32 asymmetries in the sm in the @xmath33 decay modes of @xmath34 and firstly in the @xmath35 decay modes of @xmath36 furthermore , the @xmath37 mixing effects will be firstly considered in @xmath0 asymmetries in the neutral @xmath1 meson decay modes , which will be found to be non - negligible .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section  [ formalism ] , we will show the general formulas of the @xmath0 asymmetries , @xmath23 , and the @xmath16 mixing effects on it . in section  [ fat ]",
    ", we shall present the amplitude decompositions of @xmath33 and @xmath38 decays in the fat approach .",
    "the numerical results on branching fractions and @xmath39 asymmetries will be given in section  [ result ] .",

    "we start with this more general formula of @xmath47 mixing , and will find later that the parameter @xmath48 is negligible in the @xmath32 asymmetries .    in order to study the @xmath32 asymmetries in eq.([rf ] ) , we express the amplitudes of @xmath24 and @xmath25 decays as @xmath49 where @xmath50 are real , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the weak and strong phases for the cf and dcs amplitudes , respectively .",

    "hence as a good approximation , the @xmath0 asymmetries can be expressed as @xmath69 it can be expected that @xmath70 .",
