    "entropic uncertainty relations for position and momentum , or other canonically conjugated variables have been derived a long time ago .",
    "initial investigations @xcite were devoted to continuous shannon entropies .",
    "further generalizations took into account , in a spirit of deutsch @xcite and maassen - uffink @xcite results , the accuracy of measuring devices @xcite and impurity of a quantum state @xcite .",
    "recent 12th icssur / feynfest conference showed that the topic of entropic uncertainty relations including experimental accuracies is important in the task of entanglement detection in quantum optics @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in a further part of the present section",
    "i point out some aspects related to entropic uncertainty relations , following the rephrased heisenberg sentence @xcite _ , , the more information we have about the position , the less information we can acquire about the momentum and vice versa  _ and an observation made by peres @xcite _ , , the uncertainty relation such as @xmath1 is not a statement about the accuracy of our measuring instruments_. it the second section i generalize an approach presented in @xcite to the case of finite number of measuring devices ( detectors ) .",
    "i would like to start with the famous bialynicki - birula - mycielski entropic uncertainty relation of the form @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are probability distributions in position and momentum spaces respectively .",
    "wave functions in both spaces are related to each other by the fourier transform @xmath5 the introduction of @xcite starts as follows :    _ , , the purpose of this paper is to derive a new stronger version of the heisenberg uncertainty relation in wave mechanics .",
    "this new uncertainty relation has a simple interpretation in terms of information theory .",
    "it is also closely related to newly discovered logarithmic sobolev inequalities .",
    " _    information theory enters to the inequality ( [ bbm ] ) by the notion of continuous shannon entropies @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "connection with the logarithmic sobolev inequality can be recognized with the help of the reversed logarithmic sobolev inequality @xcite which , for the probability distribution function ( pdf ) @xmath8 defined on @xmath9 , reads @xmath10.\\label{logsobol}\\ ] ] the variance is defined as usual , @xmath11 .",
    "we shall use the inequality ( [ logsobol ] ) independently for the position and momentum variables and obtain the stronger version of the heisenberg uncertainty relation , announced in @xcite @xmath12      it seems to be widely accepted that the continuous shannon entropy is also a good measure of information since it is a relative of shannon information entropy .",
    "however , this statement is not completely true . to prove that let me recall the definition of the shannon entropy of a set of probabilities @xmath13 @xmath14 we have two important properties of the shannon entropy ( [ shannon ] ) :    1 .",
    "since the probabilities @xmath15 are dimensionless the shannon entropy @xmath16 is also dimensionless .",
    "2 .   from the property @xmath17",
    "we know that @xmath18 .",
    "these two properties are essential for the information - like interpretation of the shannon entropy because information can be neither negative nor expressed in any physical units .",
    "unfortunately the continuous shannon entropy does not possess these two properties .",
    "for instance the unit of the entropy @xmath19 ( in si units ) is the logarithm of meter .",
    "this makes impossible to check if the continuous shannon entropy is positive or negative . on the other hand",
    "if we introduce some length ( momentum ) scale in order to measure @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) then we still can not fulfill the second property since @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) can be greater than @xmath23 and make the continuous entropy negative .",
    "an idea that helps to overcome the difficulties which i have mentioned above ( related to the continuous entropies ) introduces a partition of the real line into bins of equal width ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    [ fig1 ]    as a result the continuous probability distribution @xmath24 is replaced by a discrete distribution @xmath25 , ( @xmath26 ) @xmath27 the bins are of equal width , thus @xmath28 .",
    "this idea was for the first time introduced by partovi @xcite who noticed that @xmath29 shall be interpreted as a _ , , resolution of the measuring device_.      the requirement that all bins have to have the same width @xmath29 is a strong constraint on @xmath30 .",
    "in fact @xmath30 must be of the form @xmath31 so there is only one free parameter @xmath32 to be chosen .",
    "one might expect that different values of the parameter @xmath32 are equivalent to different possible choices of the central point ( @xmath33 ) of the used coordinate .",
    "in the first partovi s paper @xcite and later publications @xcite the easiest possible choice @xmath34 was made . in this choice the probability distributions and the shannon entropies are ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 are experimental accuracies for positions and momenta respectively ) : @xmath37 @xmath38    in this moment i would like to point out that the entropies defined in ( [ en1 ] , [ en2 ] ) are not correct measures of information ( because of the choice @xmath34 ) . in order to realize that one shall investigate the limit of large coarse graining ( large experimental accuracies ) @xmath39 or @xmath40 . in these limits performed measurements tell us nothing about the quantum state - our information is @xmath41 , thus , we shall expect @xmath42@xmath43 .",
    "but in fact , we have : @xmath44 as a result @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) have state - dependent values that vary between @xmath41 if the state is localized in @xmath47 or @xmath48 ( in positions or momenta ) and @xmath49 if the state is symmetric .",
    "in @xcite we captured this ambiguity and performed the redefinition of the probability distributions ( [ en1 ] ) in the following way : @xmath50 it is equivalent to the choice @xmath51 in the construction ( [ con ] ) and means that the center of the coordinate @xmath33 lays in the middle of the central bin . in the previous choice the center of the coordinate was the border point between two bins .",
    "similarly to ( [ bbm ] ) uncertainty relations for @xmath52 were found a long time @xcite .",
    "the stronger one @xcite reads @xmath53 since the shannon entropies ( [ en2 ] ) have been correctly defined ( are positive and dimensionless ) it is obvious that @xmath54 .",
    "thus , for @xmath55 the relation ( [ ibb ] ) becomes trivially satisfied and in fact does not give an optimal lower bound ( the bound is optimal , and saturated by a gaussian distribution , only in the limit @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) .",
    "some attempts @xcite to find a better lower bound failed completely ( for details see @xcite - the comment on @xcite )",
    ". recently @xcite we derived the bound    ) .",
    "red / dashed curve represents @xmath58 while green curve represents @xmath59 ; @xmath60.,title=\"fig:\"][fig2 ]    @xmath61,\\label{bound new}\\ ] ]    which is always positive , but still not optimal ( cf .",
    "function @xmath62}$ ] . ] is one of the radial prolate spheroidal wave functions of the first kind @xcite .",
    "in the definition ( [ en2 ] ) the summation over @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) goes from @xmath65 to @xmath66 . that property in a language of an experiment means that there are infinitely many measuring devices ( detectors ) covering an infinite number of bins",
    "of course in realistic experiments only a finite number of bins can be covered , thus , we shall describe the measurement s result with the help of the finite shannon entropies , defined as follows :    @xmath67    these definitions include @xmath68 detectors set to measure the probability distribution in positions and @xmath69 detectors for momenta .",
    "we have the limits @xmath70 and @xmath71 . since all terms in the sums in ( [ en2 ] ) are non - negative we know that @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "thus , we can not expect that the uncertainty relations ( [ ibb ] ) or ( [ bound new ] ) will be satisfied for @xmath74",
    ". moreover we can always find many states localized far away from the detectors ( with @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) , for example @xmath77,\\;\\longrightarrow\\quad\\rho\\left(x\\right)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}\\sigma}\\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\left(x - x_{0}\\right)^{2}}{\\sigma^{2}}\\right],\\ ] ] with @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "this inconvenience is directly related to the translational invariance which was broken when we restricted the number of used bins .",
    "of course an experimentalist knows where the measured state is and can properly choose the coordinate to assure that @xmath80 .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "2 we can realize that if @xmath81 then the previous lower bound ( [ ibb ] ) dominates .",
    "i would like to work in this regime and , although the finite number of bins makes us unable to find a state independent lower bound for @xmath74 , i would like to find a state - dependent correction to the formula ( [ ibb ] ) .",
    "i shall start in the same way as was done in @xcite and use the integral jensen inequality ( i will do the calculations only for the position variable since in the momentum case everything shall go the same way ) @xmath82\\\\ = & b_{x}+q_{\\infty}\\ln\\left(\\delta x\\right)+\\left(\\int_{-\\infty}^{-\\left(m+1/2\\right)\\delta x}+\\int_{\\left(m+1/2\\right)\\delta x}^{\\infty}\\right)dx\\rho\\left(x\\right)\\ln\\rho\\left(x\\right),\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where i have introduced the following notation : @xmath83 the shannon entropy , because of the logarithmic function , collects information from all moments of the probability distribution .",
    "a convenient method to reduce the state - dependent input can be based on the reversed logarithmic sobolev inequality ( [ logsobol ] ) .",
    "we shall choose @xmath84 and @xmath85-\\infty,-\\left(m+1/2\\right)\\delta x\\right]\\cup\\left[\\left(m+1/2\\right)\\delta x,\\infty\\right[$ ] and obtain    @xmath86    since we expect that the state fulfills @xmath87 we can , without any significant loss , simplify the right hand side of ( [ 19 ] ) @xmath88 after this step we obtain the inequality @xmath89,\\quad\\lambda\\geq0,\\ ] ] where the @xmath90 function depends only on the , , @xmath41th moment  ( the norm @xmath91 ) and the , , @xmath92nd moment  ( @xmath93 ) of the function @xmath21 restricted to @xmath94 .",
    "since the moments of the function are independent we can find @xmath95 keeping @xmath93 constant .",
    "this step will reduce the state dependent input only to the one quantity @xmath93 . in order to find the minimum we shall calculate the following derivatives @xmath96 since for @xmath97 $ ] the second",
    "derivative is positive we have only one global minimum @xmath98 . on the other hand when @xmath99 the minimum lays outside the domain of @xmath100 .",
    "thus , since @xmath90 is a decreasing function on the interval @xmath101 $ ] we shall modify @xmath102 and write @xmath103 using this result we obtain that : @xmath104 if we assume that the numbers @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) are sufficiently large , so that @xmath107 and @xmath108 we find the following uncertainty relation @xmath109 this bound gives a nontrivial limitation when @xmath110 , what it this case is equivalent to @xmath111 . in a general case",
    "the uncertainty relation for the sum of the entropies is @xmath112 , where : @xmath113",
    "i have briefly presented a current status in the topic of entropic uncertainty relations for position and momentum variables .",
    "i have pointed out ambiguities appearing in the scientific literature .",
    "finally i have investigated the case of finite number of detectors in an approach using discrete shannon entropies including experimental accuracies and derived nontrivial , state - dependent lower bound generalizing previous results .",
