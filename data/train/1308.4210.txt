    "blazars are generally considered as the most extreme class of radio - loud active galactic nuclei(agns ) , in which the two - sided jets with magnetized plasmas are launched nearby the central engine at relativistic velocity aligned with the line of sight .",
    "traditionally , blazars are classified as bl lacs and fsrqs according to the equivalent width(ew ) of their strong emission lines @xcite . the objects with a rest frame @xmath1 are called bl lacs , otherwise called fsrqs .",
    "new , based on the location of synchrotron peak frequency(@xmath2 ) @xcite , blazars with values of @xmath3hz are named low synchrotron peaked blazars(lsp ) , ones with values between @xmath4hz@xmath5hz are named intermediate synchrotron peaked blazars(isp ) , others with values of @xmath6hz@xmath7 are named high synchrotron peaked blazars(hsp ) .",
    "otherwise , from the ratio of luminosity of the blr in units of eddington units , e.g. , @xmath8 , blazars with @xmath9 mainly display the properties of fsrqs @xcite .",
    "actually , these classifications are potentially associated with the blr .",
    "the existence of the blr around central engine is an almost uncontroverted fact in blazars , especially for fsrqs .",
    "the blr is known to emit a number of strong lines and the diffuse continuums at the optical to uv bands , but its structure , for example , with spherical or ",
    "flat \" geometry , is still under debate .",
    "usually a spherical geometry of the blr is assumed , in which its photons follow a blackbody spectrum peaking at the frequency of @xmath10hz @xcite , and its radius @xmath11 is determined by the reverberation mapping technique @xcite derived from its reprocessing emission of the accretion disk @xcite . if the @xmath0-ray emission region of blazars is located within the cavity of the blr , the photons from the blr will significantly absorb the @xmath0-rays with energies above few tens of gev via positron - electron pair production processes @xcite .",
    "@xcite used a spherical blr with half thickness @xmath12(0.05@xmath13pc ) to investigate the absorption of @xmath0-rays , and demonstrated that the @xmath0-rays with energies between 10 and 200gev can not escape from the diffuse photon field of the blr .",
    "for the geometry of the blr , @xcite found that the spherical blr fails to explain the observed line width and shape in quasi - stellar objects .",
    "the  black hole mass deficit \" observed in nls1s @xcite disappears provided that nls1s have a disc - like , rather than spherical blr @xcite .",
    "@xcite produced a reasonable hardening of spectrum of quasar 3c 279 in tev bands assuming anisotropic blr structure .",
    "the stability of gev breaks , as well as the @xmath0-ray spectral breaks from a fraction of gev to tens of gev band in blazars can be well produced by the absorption of he ii lyman recombination continuum and emission lines , indicating that @xmath0-rays arise within the high - ionization zone of the blr @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the spectral properties of 3c 454.3 in gev bands , implying that @xmath0-ray emission region is close to the inner boundary of the blr , which is impossible for the spherical blr .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the properties of the blr for a set of blazars and reference quasars , and supported that the blr could have a flat geometry in blazars .    in the paper , we study the effect of the geometrical structure of the blr on the absorption of @xmath0-rays in detail .",
    "section 2 , we characterize our model .",
    "subsection 2.1 , the geometry and emission of the blr are presented , and the @xmath0-ray optical depth is calculated in subsection 2.2 .",
    "our results are presented in section 3 .",
    "discussion and conclusions are given in section 4 .",
    "in the following , we assume that the @xmath0-ray emission region moves at relativistic velocity along the jet and locates at a position @xmath14 above the accretion disk at a certain time . the generalized geometry of the blr is shown in figure [ fig : blr ] .",
    "two shaded areas with axis symmetry represent the blr clouds , and the central strip corresponds to the accretion disk .",
    "the blr is assumed to be flat and characterized by the aperture angle @xmath15 measured from the disk plane . in calculations , @xmath15",
    "are set between @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we only consider the photons from the blr without being obscured by accretion disk .",
    "the blr is geometrically thick with the scale from inner radius @xmath18 to outer radius @xmath19 .",
    "note that throughout this paper , the @xmath18 is fixed at @xmath20 , while @xmath19 is fixed at @xmath21 ( @xmath22 is the gravitational radius , @xmath23 ) .",
    "this constrain is based on the assumptions of canonical blazars as follows : ( 1 ) the accretion disk is a standard disk .",
    "the inner and outer radius are @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively @xcite ; ( 2 ) the accretion disk is within the cavity of the blr , while the @xmath19 is fixed at @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the blackbody temperature of the inner region of the accretion disk is assumed to be @xmath26k .",
    "the detailed mathematical treatments on the blr are presented in appendix .",
    "the accretion disk emits a total luminosity of @xmath27 uniformly toward all directions , the blr clouds intercept a fraction of illuminating continuum and reprocess them to the emission lines and the diffuse continuum .",
    "moreover , as stated by @xcite , the blr also emits the recombination continua of hydrogen and he ii , they could cause jumps in the @xmath0-ray opacity at @xmath28 and 4.8gev .",
    "however , in this work , we do not consider the contributions from the recombination continua to the @xmath0-ray absorption .",
    "for simplicity , we assume that the fractions @xmath29 and @xmath30 of @xmath27 are reprocessed into the emission lines @xmath31 and the diffuse continuum @xmath32 respectively , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are set to be 0.05 , i.e. , the total reprocessing fraction is fixed at 0.1 . in order to evaluate the total emission line flux from the blr",
    ", we consider the 35 components of emission lines .",
    "the sum of line ratios is given by @xmath33 relative to @xmath34 line ratio ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "therefore the flux contributed by a certain emission line equals @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the total emission line flux contributing to @xmath0-ray emission region . throughout this paper ,",
    "the luminosity of the central disk is fixed at @xmath38  erg  @xmath39 , corresponding roughly to the intermediate value of the luminosity of fsrqs .      according to the assumptions used by @xcite",
    ", the luminosity emitted by accretion disk are reprocessed into the emission lines and the diffuse continuum .",
    "the emissivity of the emission lines is @xmath40 the emissivity of the diffuse continuum is @xmath41 where the number densities of the clouds and electrons are assumed to follow the power - law distributions , e.g. , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the number densities of clouds and electrons at @xmath18 , respectively . for the radial distribution of clouds ,",
    "the same assumption is adopted , such as @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the radius of clouds at @xmath18 . in present paper , we adopt the power - law exponents preferred by @xcite to be @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",

    "the soft photon frequencies are from @xmath66hz to @xmath67hz .",
    "the upper limit over @xmath51 is set to be 2pc in all the cases .",
    "@xmath68 is the pair - creation cross section , and the threshold of @xmath68 is determined by @xmath69    in order to increase the threshold of @xmath0-ray photons in collisions , we can reduce the factor @xmath70 . in a ",

    "to reduce the number of parameters , we keep the mass of central supermassive black hole(bh ) to be @xmath71 , which is a typical mass of bh in agns .",
    "the total energy density distributions of the blr are shown in figure [ fig : u_blr ] .",
    "it is obvious that the aperture angle @xmath15 has dramatic impact on the energy density distributions",
    ". actually , with the increase of @xmath15 , the illuminating continuum intercepted by the blr clouds increases , leading to the increase of the flux of the reprocessed emissions and the diffuse continuum .",
    "the energy density is almost constant within the cavity of the blr , but at distance nearly close to @xmath18 , the energy density increases because the anisotropic effect of the blr geometry becomes more apparent .",
    "furthermore , the energy density declines outside @xmath18 , but when @xmath15 is relatively low , the energy density declines even if the distance is less than @xmath72 . in the case of small @xmath15 ,",
    "the blr is disc - like , the energy density is inversely proportional to the distance . in contrast , in larger @xmath15 nearly equaling to @xmath73 , the energy density is contributed by clouds within the blr and will decrease along the radial distance due to the obscure effect of the blr clouds .",
    "overall , the location of the peaks of the energy density shifts toward larger distance with the increase of @xmath15 .",
    "the soft photons from the blr are not only scattered by relativistic electrons in the jet to produce high - energy component in the seds of fsrqs , are but also the absorbing sources of @xmath0-rays via the processes of pair - creation .",
    "@xcite found that the @xmath0-ray photons with energies from 10 to 200gev can not escape from the diffuse field of the blr with a spherical shell geometry . in this paper , we extend a  closed \" geometry to a  flat \" geometry for calculating the @xmath0-rays absorption . because the emissivity of diffuse and line emissions is proportional to the disk luminosity @xmath27 , the optical depth @xmath74 is also proportional to @xmath27 . in figure",

    "[ fig : tau_e ] , when @xmath14 approaches @xmath18 and @xmath15 equals to @xmath16 , the @xmath0-ray photons with energies lower than critical energy @xmath78gev can escape out the diffuse field . increasing @xmath15 to @xmath79 ,",
    "the critical energy is down to @xmath80gev .",
    "accordingly , @xmath15 grows up to @xmath81 , the critical energy is down to @xmath82gev .",
    "when @xmath14=0.3pc within the blr clouds and @xmath15 is less than @xmath81 , the @xmath0-ray photons with energies up to @xmath83gev can escape out the diffuse field .",
    "we calculate the optical depths of @xmath0-ray photons in the framework of  flat \" geometry of the blr , in which  flatness \" is characterized by the aperture angle @xmath15 . for illustrating the dependence of @xmath76 on @xmath15",
    ", we consider three positions as above , @xmath84pc , while the energies of @xmath0-ray photons are considered from 50 to 100gev energy bands , the results are shown in figure [ fig : tau_alpha ] .",
    "it shows that when the @xmath0-ray emitting region locates at position @xmath85pc , the energy density of the diffuse field is large and opaque to all of the @xmath0-ray photons with energies beyond 50gev as shown in the upper panel in figure [ fig : tau_alpha ] . in middle panel ,",
    "the @xmath0-ray emitting region is close to the inner boundary of the blr , the @xmath0-ray photons undergo the short path before they escape out the blr under a certain @xmath15 .",
    "we can observe the @xmath0-ray photons with energy 50gev in the case of @xmath86 , 60gev in the case of @xmath87 , 70gev in the case of @xmath88 .",
    "when @xmath0-ray emitting region locates within the clouds of the blr , as long as the aperture angle @xmath89 , the @xmath0-ray photons from 50gev to 100gev will be observed .    because the optical depth depends on the height of the emitting region and the aperture angle , when @xmath90 , we can find a critical height @xmath91 of @xmath0-ray transparency for the aperture angle @xmath15 shown in figure [ fig : rc_alpha ] , for @xmath0-ray photons with the energies from 50gev to 100 gev .",
    "it is shown that the critical aperture angle @xmath92 moves toward smaller angle with the increase of the @xmath0-rays energies , because the decrease of @xmath15 will reduce the probability of  head - on \" collisions , leading the increase of threshold energy .",
    "for the @xmath0-ray with 100gev , @xmath93pc , the critical aperture angle @xmath92 is nearly @xmath16 , and the geometry of the blr becomes disc - like .",
    "the above results are based on the assumption that the outer radius @xmath94 of accretion disk extends to the inner radius @xmath18 of the blr , e.g. , @xmath95 . in the following ,",
    "we try to consider the effect of the disk size on soft photon fields and @xmath0-ray absorption .",

    "the disk size mainly influences the energy density of the diffuse photons field inside the blr . when @xmath98 , e.g. , the central engine is a point source of radiation that isotropically emits and radially locates behind the jet , and the energy density inside the blr becomes a constant . it is noted that the disk size does not affect the relation of @xmath91 and @xmath15 .",
    "it is evident that blr clouds do not exist near the jet axis under the disk when @xmath15 is small , and @xmath94 does not change the energy density of the diffuse photons field .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath15 is large , the critical position @xmath91 will be within the blr clouds , and the energy density keeps constant due to the obscure effect of blr clouds .",
    "the geometry of the blr is usually assumed to be an isotropic shell , the absorption of the @xmath0-ray photons by the diffuse field is serious when the @xmath0-ray emitting region locates within the cavity of the blr @xcite .",

    "the blr clouds are assumed to intercept a fraction @xmath99 of the illuminating continuum , where @xmath100 is the solid angle surrounded by the blr clouds , e.g. , @xmath101 .",
