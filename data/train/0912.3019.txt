    "furthermore , the position of the dip in density remains almost stationary , varying by not more than 5% of the potential width .",
    "the reason for this is that for our choice of parameters the energy differences between the bound states in the well are large compared to any energy scale of the incoming soliton .",

    "rel_t_ekin]-[fig : wave_left ] we show results for the energy contributions after the soliton - well collision .",
    "in particular , fig . [",
    "fig : wave_right ] gives energy contributions of the transmitted part of the soliton after the collision .",
    "there we can find that for both cases @xmath146 .",
    "the curves show oscillations in energy which can be explained due to breathing of the soliton after the collision . in the bottom panel @xmath147",
    "is given for two @xmath73 .",
    "we find again that the velocity @xmath131 decreases for larger @xmath73 .",
    "snapshots of the condensate density for different times are given in figs [ fig : wave_function_v=4.9 ] and [ fig : wave_function_v=5.1 ] .",
    "the incoming soliton transmits almost completely through the well , only a small portion is reflected as radiation .",
    "furthermore both figures show once more that the radiation increases for deeper wells , i.e. the transmitted fraction is reduced .",
    "next we look at the reflected part in fig .",
    "[ fig : wave_left ] . there",
    "the ratio between interaction and the density contribution to the kinetic energy is @xmath148 comparing to eq .",
    "( [ eq : cond_sol ] ) this clearly indicates that the reflected part in this regime is not soliton - like .",
    "instead the almost vanishing absolute value for the interaction term shows that the main contribution , the kinetic energy , is being carried by radiation as proposed in @xcite .    the findings in this section help to understand the finite width of the transmission bands that we found in sec .",
    "[ sec : level1 ] .",
    "if @xmath128 decreases the width of the transmission bands decrease as well , because less radiation is needed to trap the soliton .",
    "we illustrate the transmission and trapping behavior at the critical point for @xmath73 in figure   [ fig : carpet_transmitted_trapped ] .",
    "in addition there is a second mechanism to trap a soliton that is similar to the temporary trapping of a linear wave packet , which occurs at the boundary between reflection and transmission regions with radiation playing no role .",
    "for this situation we find that the soliton remains in the well for some time @xmath149 until it reflects .",
    "we can measure this time delay @xmath149 as the time the center of mass reaches the center of the well for the first time until it leaves the center again .",
    "furthermore we see that by carefully adjusting the potential depth @xmath149 can be large enough to observe a temporally trapped soliton in experiments .",
    "[ fig : time_delay ] shows the delay of the soliton during the transition through the well .",
    "it is remarkable that the whole soliton can be trapped with negligible losses due to radiation ( @xmath150 ) .",
    "the losses are indeed much smaller than for the first trapping mechanism described before . the time evolution of the density given in fig .",
    "[ fig : delay_trapping ] shows an example of the temporal trapping of the soliton .",
    "this delay within the well is analogues to the interaction free case for a traveling wave packet with velocity @xmath24 towards a well .",
    "there , an analytical expression for the time delay is known @xcite as @xmath151 \\right|_{e = v^2/2}\\ ; , \\label{eq : time_delay_lin}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : time_delay ] as a dashed line .",
    "this delay can be explained as a temporary trapping of the linear wave packet during which it oscillates between both ends of the well before it escapes again .",
    "however , due to the nonlinearity the position and the value for the maximum time delay differs significantly from the linear case .",
    "furthermore the time delay of eq .",
    "( [ eq : time_delay_lin ] ) becomes negative , which happens if the quantum well is deep enough to turn a quasi - bound state into a bound state which is in contrast to the nonlinear case .",
    "one should however note that in the linear case about 42% of the wave packet reflects at the point of maximal time delay . for smaller velocities this value",
    "seem to converge towards 50% .",
    "in addition the maximum time delay for the linear case lies well below the one for the nonlinear case , where it seems to diverge at the critical value for @xmath73 .",
    "therefore the connection to the nonlinear case is still unclear and needs further investigations that go beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we want to remark that although this would be an elegant way for lossless trapping of a soliton , fig .",
    "[ fig : time_delay ] also shows that the width of the this delay is very narrow and therefore harder to realize and to observe experimentally . in a bec experiment with a small enough number of atoms",
    "it may be expected that superposition states will occur in this region @xcite .",
    "hence the other trapping method is favorable when it comes to experiments , even though one has to take into account minor losses .",
    "trapping of soliton amplitude is sensitive to bound states in the well .",
    "data presented in the previous sections has already suggested that trapping results from a resonant interaction of the soliton with a stationary defect mode , where the relevant energy scale is the soliton s chemical potential . by exploiting this resonant relationship , we are able to extract the bound - state energy by analyzing soliton scattering data .",
    "we proceed by comparing the scaled particle number of nonlinear bound state solutions with the trapped component after scattering a soliton with the same chemical potential .    in this section we model the defect as an attractive delta potential @xmath152 , which has only one bound state at @xmath153 .",
    "we solve eq .",
    "( [ gpe - soliton ] ) with @xmath37 with a soliton initial wave function ( [ soliton_solution ] ) , varying the amplitude @xmath29 and thus the chemical potential @xmath154 . after",
    "the soliton has scattered , we integrate the scaled particle number @xmath155 of the trapped component ( choosing @xmath156 such as to capture at least 99% of the initial soliton s normalization ) . in fig .  [",
    "fig : probing - varv ] we compare this data with the normalization @xmath157 of a stationary localized solution @xmath158 of eq .",
    "( [ gpe - soliton ] ) with the same chemical potential @xmath159 .",
    "we analytically find @xmath160 which is shown as the full line in fig .",
    "[ fig : probing - varv ] . the energy @xmath161 of the linear bound state [ of eq .",
    "( [ gpe - soliton ] ) with @xmath82 ] is found at the intersection of the line with the @xmath77 axis , i.e. , @xmath163 at @xmath164 .    as expected , trapping is observed in the time - dependent simulation only for @xmath165 ( figs .",
    "[ fig : probing - varv ] and [ fig : probing - varv ] ) with the scaled particle number increasing with decreasing @xmath166 , roughly following eq .",
    "[ eq : ns ] . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : probing - varv ] where data with a variety of different initial velocities is compared , the trapped component is systematically about 20% larger than expected from the exact stationary solution .",
    "we have verified that the final state of the trapped component in the time - dependent simulations corresponds to a stationary solution with further reduced chemical potential compared to the initial @xmath166 .",
    "while at this time we are not able to explain why this happens , the important result is that recording the trapped component as a function of @xmath166 allows us to locate the bound - state energy @xmath161 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : probing - varv ] we have plotted the trapped component as a function of the soliton s initial chemical potential @xmath166 for different trapping potentials .",
    "least square fits of the data ( data points with @xmath167 were included ) to the functional form @xmath168 provide estimates @xmath169 for the bound state energy @xmath161 .",
    "we expect that bound state energy levels of narrow potential wells of more general shape than the one studied here could be probed experimentally by scattering bright solitons using this scheme . for defects with more than a single linear bound state",
    ", we expect that only the least strongly bound one can be detected in this manner .",
    "in this work we have investigated the scattering of a bright soliton on a linear defect in the context of matter - wave solitons . by numerical simulation and variational collective - coordinate studies",
    ", we have investigated the regime where the solitons are slow such that nonlinear energy scales dominate over kinetic energy and where the defect size is small compared to or of the same order as the soliton length .",
    "we have found a rich transmission  reflection spectrum , which is strongly influenced by the level structure of the defect .",
    "in contrast to the scattering of linear waves , as in the scattering of single or independent atoms , part of the soliton can be trapped on the defect corresponding to the population of bound states or nonlinear localized modes .",
    "we find windows of transmission associated with above - well resonances in linear scattering .",
    "nonlinear interactions modify the line shapes and lead to an abrupt onset of transmission .",
    "we have shown that particle loss of a few percent due to radiation leads to slowing down of the soliton due to energy conservation .",
    "a resonant coupling between the incoming soliton and bound states on the defect is identified as the mechanism leading to trapping and population of bound states .",
    "we have shown how this resonant coupling provides a way to experimentally probe bound states of an unknown localized potential well by scattering of nonlinear waves .    in future work",
    "it will be interesting to study the subsequent scattering of two or more solitons or the scattering of solitons as we might expect additional effects of matter - wave enhancement or triggering the release of stored solitons .",
    "in addition , quantum many - particle effects like condensate fragmentation or macroscopic quantum tunneling could be investigated in the context of resonant soliton - defect scattering .",
