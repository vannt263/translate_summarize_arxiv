    "the understanding of the structure and properties of the geometric phase in quantum mechanics , originally discovered in the context of unitary adiabatic cyclic schrdinger evolution @xcite , have improved considerably on account of several important later developments .",
    "thus it became clear in successive stages that neither the adiabatic condition nor the cyclic condition are necessary for the existence and identification of the geometric phase @xcite . in the latter step ,",
    "an important role was played by the exploitation of the fact that the state space describing the pure states of a quantum system carries a riemannian metric , leading to corresponding geodesics in this space .",
    "these geodesics were used to convert a general non - cyclic quantum evolution to a cyclic one , so that previous definitions of the geometric phase could then be used to show its existence .",
    "the third significant step was the elucidation of a purely kinematical approach to the geometric phase in which the schrdinger equation and a hermitian hamiltonian operator were both shown to be inessential @xcite    several precursors to the quantum - mechanical geometric phase concept have been recognized .",
    "of these , it may be argued that the work of pancharatnam @xcite in the context of interference phenomena in classical polarization optics , and of bargmann in the context of the wigner unitary - antiunitary theorem for symmetry operations in quantum mechanics @xcite , are particularly significant .",
    "pancharatnam s work has led to the fruitful concept of two quantum - mechanical hilbert space vectors being in phase with respect to one another , and more generally to a measure of their relative phase .",
    "the phase found by him in polarization optics has been seen later to be an early manifestation of the geometric phase in a decidedly non - adiabatic though cyclic situation .",
    "bargmann s work introduced a family of complex expressions into quantum bechanics , later given the name ",
    "bargmann invariants \" , which capture in powerful and elegant terms the essential role of complex numbers in the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics .",
    "one of the outcomes of the kinematical approach to geometric phases has been to bring out the importance of the bargmann invariants , and another has been to combine them with the geodesics mentioned earlier to show that their phases are actually geometric phases for certain cyclic evolutions @xcite .",
    "the deep interrelations that exist among the ideas of pancharatnam , bargmann and berry have been described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "more recently , further exploration of the kinematical treatment of geometric phases has led to the important concept of null phase curves ( ) in quantum - mechanical hilbert and ray spaces , which are a vast generalization of geodesics but which preserve the connection between bargmann invariants and geometric phases @xcite .",
    "this work has shown that the initial role of geodesics in geometric phase theory has been essentially fortuitous , and that it is the far more numerous s that really belong to this theory .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that the entire theory can  be built up logically based on bargmann invariants and s , with the definition of the latter actually based on the former @xcite .",
    "traditional expositions of quantum mechanics  have tended to lay stress on the complex linear structure of hilbert spaces , the non - commutativity of hermitian operators representing physical observables , and then drawing out various consequences . in more recent times , with the emphasis given to the study of ray spaces that describe pure quantum states in a one - to - one manner , the rich mathematical structures that come automatically with these spaces have received a great deal of attention @xcite . thus from the familiar complex inner products among hilbert space vectors there emerge both a riemannian structure ( mentioned above ) with a non - degenerate metric on ray space , and a symplectic structure ( a classical - looking phase space structure ) on the same ray space .",
    "quantum mechanical ray spaces are simultaneously riemannian manifolds and symplectic manifolds , and this fact would naturally be expected to have important physical manifestations and consequences .",
    "the results presented in this work point in that direction .",
    "it has been mentioned that s are far more numerous than geodesics .",
    "this is so to such an extent that it seems reasonable to ask if there are submanifolds ( of various dimensions ) in quantum - mechanical ray spaces such that every ( sufficiently smooth ) curve in any one of them is a ; and if so , how such submanifolds can be characterized .",
    "such submanifolds have been called _ null phase manifolds _ ( ) and examples given @xcite .",
    "we take up their study here and will show that the characterization of s indeed involves both the riemannian structure ( through its geodesics ) and the symplectic structure of ray space ( through the concept of isotropic submanifolds ) in equal measure .",
    "it is quite remarkable that this should be so , and it suggests that s are important for grasping the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics at the deepest level . +",
    "the contents of this paper are arranged as follows .",
    "section @xmath0 collects basic notations relating to the hilbert and ray spaces in quantum mechanics , and the definition of bargmann invariants and geometric phases in the kinematic approach .",
    "the role of ray space geodesics in providing a connection between bargmann invariants and geometric phases is sketched . after introducing the concept ,",
    "the greatly enlarged nature of this connection is mentioned .",
    "section @xmath1 begins with a set of basic relations involving geometric phases , s and the symplectic two - form on ray space .",
    "the general definition of a in ray space is then given . while it is easy to see that a is necessarily isotropic ( with respect to the ray space symplectic structure ) , the converse is not true .",
    "it is then shown by explicit construction that the most general can be characterized as follows : it is a submanifold in an isotropic and totally geodesic submanifold in ray space , though it may not itself be totally geodesic .",

    "the geometric phase for a curve @xmath35 ( of appropriate type ) is defined and most easily calculated using any lift @xmath36 of it , and it is the difference between a total ( or pancharatnam ) phase and a dynamical phase:@xmath37 = \\varphi _ { \\text{tot}}\\left [ \\mathcal{c}\\right ] -\\varphi _ { \\text{dyn}}\\left [ \\mathcal{c}\\right ]   \\\\",
