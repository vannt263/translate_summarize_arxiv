    "@xcite , many researchers consider representations on compound poisson space , see also @xcite .",
    "hence it is natural to ask about geometry and analysis on this space . on the other hand in statistical physics of continuous systems compound poisson measures and their gibbsian perturbation",
    "are used for the description of many concrete models , see e.g.  @xcite .    in constructing analysis and geometry in the space of simple configurations @xmath9 over a manifold @xmath2 ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath19 an important tool is the action of the group of diffeomorphism @xmath20 on @xmath2 which are equal to the identity outside a compact on the configuration space @xmath9 ( similar to shifts on linear spaces ) , cf .  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a natural extension of the results obtained in @xcite to the case of compound configuration space @xmath0 over a riemannian manifold @xmath2 , i.e. , the space of @xmath21-valued measures on @xmath2 of the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a finite measure on @xmath21 .",
    "this geometry is constructed via a `` lifting procedure '' and is completely determined by the riemannian structure on @xmath2 ( cf .",
    "subsection [ 3eq58 ] ) .",
    "in particular , we obtain the corresponding intrinsic gradient @xmath3 , divergence @xmath24 , and laplace - beltrami operator @xmath25@xmath26 . for details",
    "we refer to section [ 3eq59 ] and section [ 3eq60 ] . here",
    "we only mention that the `` tangent bundle '' @xmath27 of @xmath0 is given as follows @xmath28 i.e. , the space of sections in the tangent bundle @xmath29 of @xmath2 which are square - integrable with respect to the radon measure @xmath30 .",
    "since each @xmath31 is thus a hilbert space ( endowed with the corresponding @xmath32-inner product @xmath33 coming from the measure @xmath30 ) @xmath0 obtains a riemannian - type structure which is non - trivial ( i.e. , varies with @xmath30 ) even when @xmath34 .",
    "the problem of analysis and geometry on infinite dimensional spaces is highly connected with the lack of a good notion of `` volume element '' which is due to the fact that there is no lebesgue measure on infinite dimensional linear spaces .",
    "the volume element on @xmath2 is ( up to constant multiples ) the unique positive radon measure @xmath35 on @xmath2 such that the gradient @xmath36 and the divergence @xmath37 become dual operators on @xmath38 ( w.r.t .",
    "@xmath39 ) , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "in subsection [ 3eq61 ] we prove that the probability measure @xmath40 on @xmath0 for which @xmath3 and @xmath24 become dual operators on @xmath8 ( w.r.t .",
    "@xmath41 ) is the right `` volume element '' corresponding to our differential geometry on @xmath0 .",
    "of course for completeness concerning the `` volume element '' one should investigate for which class of measures the above result is valid but we do not explore this question in the paper .",
    "let us stress that the `` test '' functions @xmath42 ( resp .",
    "`` test '' vector fields @xmath43 ) we consider as domains for our gradient @xmath3 ( resp .",
    "@xmath44 ) above are of cylinder type , i.e. , @xmath45 if and only if @xmath46 for some @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 ( and @xmath43 correspondingly , cf .",
    "( [ 3eq24 ] ) ) .",
    "hence so far the analysis on @xmath50 is basically finite dimensional .",
    "however , we can do generic infinite dimensional analysis on @xmath0 by introducing the first order sobolev space @xmath51 by closing the corresponding dirichlet form @xmath52 on @xmath8 , i.e. , a function @xmath53 is together with its gradient @xmath54 obtained as a limit in @xmath55 of a sequence @xmath56 , resp .",
    "@xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "thus such @xmath59 really depends on infinitely many points in @xmath2 ( cf .",
    "subsections [ 3eq62 ] , [ 3eq63 ] ) .    since on @xmath2 there is a natural diffusion process intrinsically determined by the geometry , namely distorted brownian motion on @xmath2 , it is natural to ask whether the same is true for our geometry on @xmath0 .",
    "in the case of the space of simple configurations @xmath9 this process is constructed using the standard theory of dirichlet forms ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , see recent results in @xcite and @xcite . in the case of compound configuration space",
    "this process has a simple relation with the one mentioned above .",
    "let us explain this more precisely .",
    "we regard every compound configuration @xmath60 as depending on two variables , namely @xmath61 ( or more general marked configuration ) and this allowed us to obtain the following embedding @xmath62 as a result we may apply operators acting on @xmath63 , e.g.  @xmath64 , @xmath65 to the space @xmath8 acting on part of the variables , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the following equality holds @xmath66 and from this relation it is not hard to obtain relations between the dirichlet operators as well as between the correspondings semigroups .",
    "therefore the process associated to our dirichlet form is nothing but the process @xmath67 , @xmath68 , together with marks , i.e. , @xmath69 where @xmath67 is just the equilibrium process on @xmath70 , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "6 ) for details .",
    "we describe this procedure in detail in section [ 3eq64 ] .",
    "we would like to emphasize the contents of subsection [ 3eq65 ] .",
    "it is well - known , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "6 ) that there is a canonical unitary representation on compound poisson space , i.e. , @xmath71 , of the group of diffeomorphisms @xmath20 . on the basis of our results described above ,",
    "we provide a corresponding representation of the associated lie algebra of compactly supported vector fields .",
    "we also exhibit explicit formulas for the corresponding generators .",
    "thus the contents of sections [ 3eq59 ] , [ 3eq60 ] , and [ 3eq64 ] have been described .",
    "it remains to add that section [ 3eq46 ] consists of necessary preliminaries to the furthers sections .",
    "finally in section [ 3eq56 ] we prove in detail the existence of a marked poisson measure over the marked poisson space @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is a complete separable metric space with a probability measure .",
    "hence all the results obtained in this paper extend with trivial changes to marked poisson space .",
    "last but not least we would like to mention that most of the results obtained in this paper extend in a natural way ( along the lines of the work @xcite and @xcite ) to the case where compound poisson measures are replaced by gibbs measures of ruelle type .",

    "<S> in this paper we carry out analysis and geometry for a class of infinite dimensional manifolds , namely , compound configuration spaces as a natural generalization of the work @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely a differential geometry is constructed on the compound configuration space @xmath0 over a riemannian manifold @xmath1 this geometry is obtained as a natural lifting of the riemannian structure on @xmath2 . in particular , the intrinsic gradient @xmath3 divergence @xmath4 , and laplace - beltrami operator @xmath5@xmath6 are constructed . therefore the corresponding dirichlet forms @xmath7 on @xmath8 can be defined . </S>",
    "<S> each is shown to be associated with a diffusion process on @xmath0 ( so called equilibrium process ) which is nothing but the diffusion process on the simple configuration space @xmath9 together with corresponding marks , i.e , @xmath10 . as another consequence of our results </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a representation of the lie - algebra of compactly supported vector fields on @xmath2 on compound poisson space . </S>",
    "<S> finally generalizations to the case when @xmath11 is replaced by a marked poisson measure @xmath12 easily follow from this construction .    </S>",
