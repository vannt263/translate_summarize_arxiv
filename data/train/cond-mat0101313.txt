    "<S> we propose a simple stirring experiment to generate quantized ring currents and solitary excitations in bose - einstein condensates in a toroidal trap geometry . </S>",
    "<S> simulations of the 3d gross - pitaevskii equation show that pure ring current states can be generated efficiently by adiabatic manipulation of the condensate , which can be realized on experimental time scales . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated by simulated generation of a ring current with winding number two . </S>",
    "<S> while solitons can be generated in quasi-1d tori , we show the even more robust generation of hybrid , solitonic vortices ( svortices ) in a regime of wider confinement . </S>",
    "<S> svortices are vortices confined to essentially one - dimensional dynamics , which obey a similar phase - offset  velocity relationship as solitons . </S>",
    "<S> marking the transition between solitons and vortices , svortices are a distinct class of symmetry - breaking stationary and uniformly rotating excited solutions of the 2d and 3d gross - pitaevskii equation in a toroidal trapping potential . </S>",
    "<S> svortices should be observable in dilute - gas experiments </S>",
    "<S> .    persistent currents , quantized vortices , and solitons in bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) are high - energy excitations predicted by mean - field theory . quite recently , both solitonic waves @xcite and singly quantized vortices @xcite have been unambiguously identified experimentally in 3d harmonic trap geometries . </S>",
    "<S> the next step in increasing our understanding of quantized currents and solitons is to study their stability properties and measure their intrinsic lifetimes thereby testing the validity of mean - field theory in a so - far unexplored regime . </S>",
    "<S> the torus presents an ideal geometry in this context as solitons can travel without reaching an end of the trap and ring currents are stabilized by the ring geometry as opposed to vortices where the core can drift @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> excited states in toroidal traps also have the potential to provide useful applications . </S>",

    "<S> _ @xcite have suggested constructing a mode - locked atom laser using a dark soliton with a nodal plane ( also called a black soliton or kink configuration ) in a ring geometry . </S>",
    "<S> they demonstrated the creation of a black soliton by stirring a condensate in a 1d ring with a paddle at constant angular velocity and damping additionally generated excitations by raman outcoupling . </S>",
    "<S> other simulations involving nonlinear excitations in toroidal geometries can be found in references @xcite .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we propose an adiabatic stirring technique to impose circulation onto a bec in a 3d toroidal geometry . without any need for external cooling or damping mechanisms , </S>",
    "<S> adiabatic manipulations allow one to generate pure ring - current states with essentially arbitrary circulation . </S>",
    "<S> a variation of the stirring technique can produce solitons if the transverse trap confinement in the toroidal tube is quasi-1d . for </S>",
    "<S> slightly less tight confinement new nonlinear objects are created , which have properties of both vortices and solitons . </S>",
    "<S> we call these objects solitonic vortices , or svortices , and briefly discuss their properties .    in our simulations , </S>",
    "<S> the condensate is stirred with a rotating paddle which can easily be realized with a blue - detuned laser - generated light sheet . </S>",
    "<S> being purely optical in nature , this method does not rely on specific magnetic field configurations and is suitable for single - component as well as spinor condensates . </S>",

    "<S> the last column shows the @xmath44 ring current that has established in the toroidal trap . </S>",
    "<S> the transverse confinement in the torus is @xmath55 healing lengths . ]    in order to elucidate the effect of adiabatic stirring on the condensate wavefunction and to interpret the result of the simulation shown in figure  [ fig_b48_vort_gen ] , we start with an idealized 1-d picture , neglecting the transverse dimensions of the torus : when blocked by a paddle , the torus can be treated as a 1d box with hard - wall boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state @xmath56 of the condensate in a 1d box is a jacobi elliptic function of type @xmath57 @xcite , which is real - valued and therefore has a constant phase . </S>",
    "<S> when the paddle is moving , the wavefunction acquires a phase ramp . </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood by considering the galilean invariance of the nlse : the boosted ground state @xmath58 $ ] satisfies the boundary conditions in the moving frame and is the `` ground state '' of the translated box . </S>",
    "<S> a phase gradient in the wavefunction is equivalent to a supercurrent with velocity @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> a state like this can either be reached by an adiabatic transition between the resting and the moving box through accelerating the paddle slowly or one can prepare the condensate right from the start in a torus with a rotating paddle . </S>",
    "<S> removal of the stirring paddle reconnects both ends of the `` 1d box '' to a ring and can be modelled in 1d as decreasing a narrow potential barrier to zero height . in the adiabatic limit of this process , </S>",
    "<S> the phase step of @xmath60 acquired by stirring reconnects at the nearest integer multiple of @xmath48 while the density is still low . in this way </S>",
    "<S> phase gradients are smoothed out before the density notch fills in completely leaving the condensate in an azimuthally symmetric current - carrying state thus creating a pure toroidal ring current . in this idealized picture </S>",
    "<S> there is no upper limit for the current velocities . above a critical velocity , however , the supercurrent is instable against phase slips on resting obstacles which might arise through imperfections in the trap @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is not obvious that the simple 1d picture of adiabatic stirring sketched above should be transferable to experimental conditions in 3d tori well out of the quasi-1d limit . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation of figure  [ fig_b48_vort_gen ] , however , shows that an essentially pure ring - current state can be generated by realistic choices of time scales and parameters . in order to get a rough estimate for the timescale of adiabaticity , consider the time @xmath61 it takes for a sound wave to travel around the ring of radius @xmath62 once . </S>",
    "<S> we use the bogoliubov speed of sound @xmath63 @xcite , which amounts to @xmath64 at the peak density of the numerically obtained ground - state wavefunction , to estimate this time to @xmath65s . </S>",
    "<S> it is further useful to compare the acceleration rate of the stirring paddle to @xmath66 , which is the acceleration that brings the velocity up to the speed of sound in the time that it takes a sound wave to travel around the ring . </S>",
    "<S> we find that acceleration rates of about @xmath67 work well . alternatively , instead of starting with the ground state of an intersected toroidal trap , the light sheet potential barrier can also be ramped up slowly . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations show that ramping up the paddle linearly within about @xmath68 is sufficiently slow in order to make no appreciable difference for the generation of ring currents . </S>",
    "<S> further , retracting the core potential @xmath17 , as realized in reference  @xcite , leads to the generation of vortex filaments . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that essentially pure vortex states can be generated by ramping down the core - potential on a timescale of about @xmath69 .    </S>",
    "<S> a variation of the stirring experiment as described above can be used to generate solitons . in the non - adiabatic limit , when the intersecting light sheet is removed suddenly , the imposed phase step and density notch set an initial condition for the dynamics of the condensate . </S>",
    "<S> it has been discussed in other places , that the combination of a phase step @xcite and a density notch is a very efficient way to start density - notch solitons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for the example of a linear quasi-1d trap it is discussed by carr _ et .  </S>",
    "<S> al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite how the combination of a density notch generated by sudden removal of a gaussian potential barrier in combination with a phase step can lead to the generation of one or more solitons with different velocities depending on the size of the phase step and the width of the potential barrier . </S>",
    "<S> we have performed simulations in tightly - confined toroidal traps with a transverse confinement in terms of healing lengths @xmath70 between 2 and 5 , where we observe a quasi-1d type of behaviour and the discussion in reference  @xcite applies . </S>",
    "<S> our 3d simulations show the generation of band solitons upon sudden removal of the paddle .    </S>",
    "<S> however , in situations where the confinement is less tight and the curvature of the torus becomes apparent the phenomenology changes : we observe the robust generation of a unique class of solitary excitations in a torus with transverse confinement in terms of healing lengths @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> these excitations have properties of both solitons and vortices , as will be elaborated below , and therefore we call them solitonic vortices or _ svortices_. figure  [ fig_sol_gen ] shows a simulated stirring experiment in a condensate of @xmath31 atoms of na where a phase step of approximately @xmath72 is generated by stirring na atoms : @xmath73hz , @xmath74nk , @xmath75 m ; @xmath76nk ; @xmath77 m ; @xmath78 m . </S>",
    "<S> the toroid radius in this simulation is @xmath79 m . at peak density of the condensate ground state in the torus </S>",
    "<S> we find a bogoliubov sound speed of @xmath80 and healing length of @xmath81 m . ] . </S>",
    "<S> ramping down the paddle potential within 66ms ( which is roughly @xmath82 with @xmath83s in this simulation ) , a solitary wave is created that has characteristics of both solitons and vortices . </S>",
    "<S> while showing the phase singularity signature of a vortex , the density profile is squeezed by the tranverse confinement ( see figure  [ fig_svort_iso ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> after the stirring potential is turned off , the svortex moves at constant angular velocity around the ring . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations show that the velocity of the svortex is sensitive to the details of the stirring process like the paddle acceleration rate and timescale of paddle retraction . </S>",
    "<S> similar to solitons , the velocity of svortices relative to the condensate is related to a phase offset .     and the phase @xmath13 of the condensate at different times as in figure  [ fig_b48_vort_gen ] . </S>",
    "<S> the first and the second column show the acceleration phase which lasts from @xmath84 to @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> afterwards the condensate is stirred with constant angular velocity @xmath86hz . </S>",
    "<S> the paddle is contracted between @xmath87 and @xmath88 . due to the transverse confinement being about 9 healing lengths , </S>",
    "<S> a dark soliton is not completely stabilized but transforms into a vortex by the influence of curvature . </S>",
    "<S> a state is generated which is on the transition between a dark soliton and vortex . ]     in the xy plane . </S>",
    "<S> the condensate wavefunction was prepared in a stirring experiment described in the text below . </S>",
    "<S> the solitary density deformation and phase singularity preserve their shape while rotating clockwise about the axis of the torus with roughly half the angular velocity of a ring current carrying a single quantum of vorticity . </S>",
    "<S> the current plot shows the wavefunction at @xmath89s . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the velocity of solitons relative to the condensate is given by @xmath90 @xcite , where @xmath91 is the phase step across the density notch relating to standing black solitons ( kink states ) at @xmath92 and to increasingly shallow gray solitons moving with the speed of sound @xmath93 as @xmath91 approaches zero . </S>",
    "<S> the experiments of reference  @xcite have confirmed this relation for dark solitons in a bec . </S>",
    "<S> we find that svortices obey a similar relationship . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig_velo ] shows the velocity  phase - offset relation for a svortex and a band soliton , which have been created by imaginary - time propagation in a long thin rectangular 2d box ( of dimensions @xmath94 ) with hard - wall boundary conditions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the svortex velocity depends linearly on small deviations of the phase offset from @xmath72 resembling the relation ( [ velooffset ] ) for solitons . </S>",
    "<S> the proportionality coefficient , however , is below the value for solitons , given by the bogoliubov sound speed @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> simulations in differently sized boxes show that this coefficient depends strongly on the transverse confinement . </S>",
    "<S> we observe the discussed behaviour for transverse confinements @xmath70 between 6 and 12 healing lengths . </S>",
    "<S> it is this velocity  phase - offset relation , which makes the vortex confined to a thin waveguide a solitonic vortex or svortex . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed analysis of the svortex s properties including the collisional properties , which are considerably more complicated than those of solitons , will be published elsewhere @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the term `` vortex soliton '' or `` optical vortex soliton '' has been used before in the nonlinear optics community in a much broader context @xcite whereas we introduce the term solitonic vortices referring to transversely confined vortices with specific solitonic properties .    . </S>",
    "<S> a stationary black band soliton ( nodal - plane state ) and a stationary svortex were set in motion by imprinting a phase step . </S>",
    "<S> the deviation of the measured phase offset @xmath91 from @xmath72 is approximately half the imprinted phase step . ]    in conclusion , we have shown that ring currents and solitonic structures can be generated very efficiently in toroidal trap geometries by stirring the condensate with a blue detuned laser light sheet and consequently retracting the stirring paddle . </S>",
    "<S> pure ring currents can be generated this way for a wide range of transverse confinement parameters . </S>",
    "<S> density notch dark and gray solitons can be generated in quasi-1d transversely confined tori . in a regime of slightly wider confinement , a novel hybrid object with properties of solitons and vortices is generated . </S>",
    "<S> these solitonic vortices show a phase - offset  velocity relationship similar to solitons .    </S>",
