    "ground - based , coronagraphic images of @xmath3  pic reveal an asymmetric , flared disk extending at least 1800  au from the star and viewed nearly `` edge - on '' @xcite .",
    "high - resolution _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ and adaptive - optics images show that the inner part of the disk ( @xmath12100  au from @xmath3  pic ) is warped in a manner consistent with the presence of a secondary disk that is inclined by @xmath20 from the main disk and perhaps sustained by a massive planet in a similarly inclined , eccentric orbit @xcite .",
    "_ hst _ and ground - based images also reveal concentrations of dust along the northeast extension of the disk about 500800  au from the star that have been interpreted as an asymmetric system of rings formed , along with other asymmetries in the disk , after a close encounter with a passing star @xcite .",
    "spatially resolved mid - infrared images show an asymmetric inner disk having depleted dust within 40  au of @xmath3  pic @xcite and oblique clumps of emission 2080  au from the star @xcite .",
    "these features suggest the presence of noncoplanar dust rings whose locations conform to the mean - motion resonances of a putative planetary system .",
    "constraints on the sizes of the dust grains observed in scattered light have been based upon multiband ( _ bvri _ ) imaging studies of the disk in both unpolarized @xcite and polarized @xcite light .",
    "the unpolarized images indicate that the disk is colorless ( within uncertainties of 2030% ) at distances 100300  au from @xmath3  pic , though its @xmath0-band brightness may be suppressed at 50  au from the star .",
    "( or @xmath21  pc ) reported for @xmath3  pic by @xcite based on astrometric measurements conducted with the _ hipparcos _ satellite .",
    "consequently , the projected distances reported in this paper may differ from those appearing in papers published before 1997 , which were based on an erroneous distance of 16.4  pc to the star .",
    "] this neutral scattering by the disk has been customarily viewed as evidence that the dust grains are much larger than the wavelengths of the scattered light ( @xmath22 m ) .",
    "however , @xcite noted that the @xmath0- , @xmath1- , and @xmath2-band scattering efficiencies of silicate spheres were similar for grains with radii of 0.2@xmath23 m .",
    "attempts to reconcile the neutral colors of the disk with the 1025% polarization of scattered light from the disk have been problematic . @xcite and @xcite found that , although the polarization alone is best fitted with a grain size distribution with a lower limit of a few microns , the observed neutral colors can only be replicated by adding submicron - sized grains and lowering either the refractive index of the grains or the proportion of the smallest grains .",
    "given the adjustments needed to match the polarization models with the highly uncertain disk colors , a more precise multicolor imaging study of the @xmath3  pic disk is warranted .    in this paper , we present multiband coronagraphic images of @xmath3  pic s circumstellar disk obtained with _",
    "hst s _ advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) @xcite .",
    "these images reveal the disk between 30 and 300  au from the star with unprecedented spatial resolution , scattered - light suppression , and photometric precision .",
    "these qualities permit the measurement of the disk s optical colors with 310 times better precision than previously reported from ground - based observations . by deconvolving the instrumental point - spread function ( psf ) from each image",
    ", we accurately determine the brightnesses , morphologies , and asymmetries of the two disk components associated with the warp in the inner disk .",
    "our fully - processed images and results will likely serve as the empirical standards for subsequent scattered - light models of the inner disk until the next generation of space - based coronagraphic imagers is deployed .",
    "multiband , coronagraphic images of the a5v star @xmath3  pic were recorded on ut  2003 october  1 using the high resolution channel ( hrc ) of acs @xcite . the hrc features a @xmath24-pixel ccd detector whose pixels subtend an area of 0028  @xmath25  0025 , providing a @xmath26 field of view ( fov ) .",
    "beta pic was acquired in the standard `` peak - up '' mode with the coronagraph assembly deployed in the focal plane of the aberrated beam .",
    "the star was then positioned behind the small ( 09 radius ) occulting spot located approximately at the center of the fov .",
    "_ hst _ was oriented so that the disk s midplane appeared approximately perpendicular to the @xmath27 occulting finger and the large ( 15 radius ) occulting spot that also lie in the fov .",
    "short , medium , and long exposures were recorded through the f435w ( @xmath0 ) , f606w ( broad @xmath1 ) , and f814w ( broad @xmath2 ) filters over three consecutive _ hst _ orbits .",
    "all images were digitized using the default analog - to - digital conversion of @xmath28  dn@xmath29 .",
    "this sequence of exposures was promptly repeated after rolling _ hst _ about the line of sight by @xmath30 .",
    "this offset changed the orientation of the disk in the fov by @xmath30 and facilitated the discrimination of features associated with the disk from those intrinsic to the coronagraphic psf .",
    "immediately before the exposures of @xmath3  pic , coronagraphic images of the a7iv star @xmath31  pictoris were recorded through the same filters to provide reference images of a star having colors similar to those of @xmath3  pic but no known circumstellar dust .",
    "a log of all hrc exposures is given in table  [ explog ] .",
    "the initial stages of image reduction ( i.e. , subtraction of bias and dark frames and division by a noncoronagraphic flat field ) were performed by the acs image calibration pipeline at the space telescope science institute ( stsci ) @xcite . to correct the vignetting caused by the occulting spots",
    ", we divided the images by normalized `` spot flats '' that were appropriately registered to the approximate locations of the migratory occulting spots on the date of our observations @xcite .",
    "we then averaged the constituent images of each set of exposures listed in table  [ explog ] after interpolating over static bad pixels and eliminating transient bad pixels with a conventional @xmath32 rejection algorithm .",
    "we then normalized the averaged images to unit exposure time and replaced saturated pixels in the long - exposure images with unsaturated pixels at corresponding locations in the shorter - exposure images . throughout this process",
    ", we tracked the uncertainties associated with each image pixel . in this manner , we created cosmetically clean , high - contrast images and meaningful error maps for each combination of star , filter , and roll angle .",
    "figure  [ abpic ] shows @xmath33 sections of the reduced f606w images of @xmath3  pic and @xmath31  pic obtained at each roll angle .      to distinguish the brightness and morphology of the disk from the diffracted and scattered light of @xmath3  pic",
    ", the occulted star s psf must be removed from each image . by observing @xmath31  pic and @xmath3  pic in consecutive _ hst _ orbits ,",
    "we limited the differences between the coronagraphic psfs of the two stars that would otherwise be caused by inconsistent redeployment of the coronagraph assembly , gradual migration of the occulting spot , or changes in _ hst s _ thermally driven focus cycles @xcite .",
    "we measured the positions of the stars behind the occulting spot using the central peaks of the reduced coronagraphic psfs ( figure  [ abpic ] ) that result from the reimaging of incompletely occulted , spherically aberrated starlight by acs s corrective optics @xcite .",
    "the positions of @xmath3  pic and @xmath31  pic differed by @xmath34  pixel ( @xmath3502 ) .",
    "this offset causes differences between the coronagraphic psfs that are large in the immediate vicinity of the occulting spot , but the residual light at larger field angles ( @xmath36 from the star ) after psf subtraction is @xmath37 times fainter than the disk s midplane at those field angles @xcite .",
    "optimal subtraction of the coronagraphic psf requires accurate normalization and registration of the filter images of the reference star @xmath31  pic with the corresponding images of @xmath3  pic .",
    "because direct images of the two stars were not obtained , we estimated the brightnesses of each star in each acs bandpass using the _ hst _ synthetic photometry package , synphot , which has been developed and distributed by stsci @xcite . in doing so , we used the optical spectra of the a5v stars @xmath38  serpentis and praesepe  154 @xcite to approximate the spectrum of @xmath3  pic .",
    "likewise , we approximated the spectrum of @xmath31  pic with that of the a5iv star hd  165475b .",
    "these proxies yielded synthetic johnson ",
    "cousins photometry that closely match the cousins _ bvri _ measurements of @xmath31  pic and @xmath3  pic reported by @xcite . assuming @xmath1 magnitudes of 3.27 and 3.86 for @xmath31  pic and @xmath3  pic , respectively , we computed synthetic flux ratios , @xmath39 , of 1.65 , 1.75 , and 1.90 for f435w , f606w , and f814w , respectively .",
    "we then divided the images of @xmath31  pic by these ratios to bring the integrated brightnesses of the reference psfs into conformity with those of @xmath3  pic .",
    "we aligned the normalized images of @xmath31  pic with the corresponding images of @xmath3  pic using an interactive routine that permits orthogonal shifts of an image with subpixel resolution and cubic convolution interpolation .",
    "the shift intervals and normalization factors ( i.e. , @xmath39 ) were progressively refined throughout the iterative process .",
    "we assessed the quality of the normalization and registration by visually inspecting the difference image created after each shift or normalization adjustment .",
    "convergence was reached when the subtraction residuals were visibly minimized and refinements of the shift interval or normalization factor had inconsequential effects .",
    "based on these qualitative assessments , we estimate that the uncertainty of the registration along each axis is 0.125  pixel and the uncertainty of @xmath39 in each bandpass is 2% .    after subtracting the coronagraphic psfs from each image , we transformed the images to correct the pronounced geometric distortion in the hrc image plane . in doing so",
    ", we used the coefficients of the biquartic - polynomial distortion map provided by stsci @xcite and cubic convolution interpolation to conserve the imaged flux .",
    "we then combined the images obtained at each _ hst _ roll angle by rotating the images of the second group clockwise by @xmath40 ( table  [ explog ] ) , aligning the respective pairs of images according to the previously measured stellar centroids , and averaging the image pairs after rejecting pixels that exceeded their local @xmath32 values .",
    "again , we tracked the uncertainties associated with each stage of image processing to maintain a meaningful map of random pixel errors .",
    "we combined in quadrature the final random - error maps with estimates of the systematic errors caused by uncertainties in the normalization and registration of the reference psfs .",
    "other systematic errors from cyclic changes of _ hst s _ focus and differences between the field positions and broadband colors of @xmath31  pic and @xmath3  pic are negligible compared with the surface brightness of @xmath3  pic s disk over most of the hrc s fov @xcite .",
    "our systematic - error maps represent the convolved differences between the optimal psf - subtracted image of @xmath3  pic and three nonoptimal ones generated by purposefully misaligning ( along each axis ) or misscaling the images of @xmath31  pic by amounts equal to our estimated uncertainties in psf registration and @xmath39 .",
    "the total systematic errors are 15 times larger than the random errors within @xmath41 of @xmath3  pic , but they diminish to 1025% of the random errors beyond @xmath42 of the star .",
    "we refer to the combined maps of random and systematic errors as total - error maps .",
    "figure  [ bvidisk ] shows the reduced and psf - subtracted images of the disk in each acs bandpass .",
    "each image has been rotated so that the northeast extension of the disk is displayed horizontally to the left of each panel .",
    "the images have been divided by the brightness of @xmath3  pic in each bandpass derived from synphot .",
    "pic obtained from synphot : @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "the systematic zero - point errors are @xmath46% @xcite , and the estimated errors from imperfectly matched reference spectra are @xmath52% . ] the alternating light and dark bands near the occulting spot reflect imperfect psf subtraction caused by the slightly mismatched colors and centroids of @xmath31  pic and @xmath3  pic .",
    "the bands perpendicular to the disk have amplitudes that are @xmath7100% of the midplane surface brightnesses at similar distances from @xmath3  pic .",
    "these residuals preclude accurate photometry of the disk within 15 ( @xmath47  au ) of the star and anywhere along the direction of the occulting finger . along the midplane of the disk ,",
    "the photometric uncertainties due to psf subtraction are @xmath4810% at a radius of @xmath49  au and less than 1% for @xmath50  au .",
    "figure  [ bvispine ] shows alternate views of the disk in which the vertical scale is expanded by a factor of four over that presented in figure  [ bvidisk ] and the vertical dimension of the disk s surface brightness is normalized by the brightness measured along the `` spine '' of the disk .",
    "( the spine comprises the vertical locations of the maximum disk brightness measured along the horizontal axis of each image , after smoothing with a @xmath51 pixel boxcar . )",
    "the expanded vertical scale exaggerates the warp in the inner disk first observed in images taken with _",
    "hst s _ wide field planetary camera  2 ( wfpc2 ) by @xcite .",
    "the multiband images shown in figures  [ bvidisk ] and [ bvispine ] may be directly compared with the unfiltered optical image of the disk obtained with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) coronagraph @xcite and shown in figure  8 of @xcite .",
    "accurate assessment of the chromatic dependencies of the disk s color and morphology requires the deconvolution of the unocculted instrumental psf from each hrc filter image .",
    "this deconvolution of the `` off - spot '' psf is especially important for the f814w images , because very red photons ( @xmath52 m ) passing through the hrc s ccd detector are scattered diffusely from the ccd substrate into a large halo that contributes significantly to the wide - angle component of the psf @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , no collection of empirical off - spot reference psfs exists yet for the hrc coronagraph .",
    "consequently , we can deconvolve the off - spot psfs only approximately by using synthetic psfs generated by the tiny tim software package distributed by stsci @xcite .",
    "tiny tim employs a simplistic model of the red halo that does not consider its known asymmetries @xcite , but this model is sufficient for assessing the general impact of the red halo on our images of @xmath3  pic s disk .",
    "we generated model off - spot psfs using the optical prescriptions , filter transmission curves , and sample a5v source spectrum incorporated in tinytim .",
    "for simplicity , we approximated the weakly field - dependent psf in each bandpass with single model psfs characteristic of the center of the fov .",
    "the model psfs extended to an angular radius of @xmath53 .",
    "we corrected the geometrically distorted model psfs in the manner described in ",
    "[ psfsub ] , and then deconvolved them from the psf - subtracted images of @xmath3  pic obtained at each roll angle . in doing so",
    ", we applied the lucy ",
    "richardson deconvolution algorithm @xcite to each image outside a circular region of radius 15 centered on the subtracted star .",
    "( the amplitudes and spatial frequencies of the psf - subtraction residuals within this region were too large to yield credible deconvolved data . )",
    "the imaged fov lacked any bright point - sources by which we could judge convergence of the deconvolution , so we terminated the computation after 50 iterations .",
    "examination of intermediate stages of the process showed no perceptible change in the deconvolved images after @xmath54 iterations .",
    "figures  [ bvidisklucy ] and [ bvispinelucy ] are the deconvolved counterparts of figures  [ bvidisk ] and [ bvispine ] , respectively .",
    "the compensating effect of the deconvolution is especially evident when comparing the morphologies of the disk in figures  [ bvispine ] and [ bvispinelucy ] .",
    "the color - coded isophotes of the disk in each bandpass are much more similar in the deconvolved images than in the convolved images .",
    "the amplified , correlated noise in the deconvolved images is characteristic of the lucy ",
    "richardson algorithm when applied to faint , extended sources .",
    "it is a consequence of the algorithm s requirements of a low background signal , nonzero pixel values , and flux conservation on both local and global scales",
    ". these requirements also account for the disappearance of the negative psf - subtraction residuals near the occulting spot .",
    "the requirement of local flux conservation ensures reliable photometry in regions where the ratio of signal to noise ( s / n ) is large and where psf - subtraction residuals are small , but it makes photometric measurements elsewhere less accurate and their uncertainties nonanalytic .",
    "the processed acs / hrc images shown in figures  [ bvidisk ] and [ bvispine ] are the finest multiband , scattered - light images of @xmath3  pic s inner disk obtained to date.dag/betapic . ]",
    "earlier ground - based , scattered - light images show the usual effects of coarse spatial resolution and psf instability caused by variable atmospheric and local conditions @xcite .",
    "the unpublished _ bvri _",
    "wfpc2 images of the disk described by @xcite have comparatively low s / n ratios because wfpc2 lacks a coronagraphic mode and directly imaged starlight scatters irregularly along the surface of its ccd detectors .",
    "these conditions forced short exposure times to avoid excessive detector saturation and created irreproducible artifacts in the psf - subtracted images .",
    "moreover , the construction of a wfpc2 reference psf from images of @xmath3  pic obtained at several roll angles allowed possible contamination of the reference psf by the innermost region of the disk . the unfiltered stis images of the disk @xcite compare favorably with our hrc images , notwithstanding their lack of chromatic information and partial pupil apodization @xcite .",
    "both sets of images show the same region of the disk , though stis s narrow occulting wedge permitted imaging of the disk s midplane about 04 ( 8  au ) closer to the star .",
    "the hrc s circular occulting spot and lyot stop exposed the regions around the projected minor axis of the disk that were obscured in the stis images by diffraction spikes and the shadow of the occulting bar .",
    "the hrc images have twice the spatial resolution of the stis images , and they exhibit better s / n ratios in the regions of the disk between 150 and 250  au from the star .",
    "figure  [ diskcon ] shows isophotal maps of our f606w images of the disk before and after deconvolution of the off - spot psf .",
    "these maps are qualitatively similar to those generated from our f435w and f814w images .",
    "they confirm the morphology and asymmetries of the disk reported previously by several groups and described in detail by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the brightness asymmetry between the disk s opposing extensions is particularly evident along the spine beyond @xmath18  au of @xmath3  pic .",
    "the asymmetric curvature of the isophotes on opposite sides of the spine and the inversion of this asymmetry across the projected minor axis of the disk are also apparent .",
    "@xcite referred to this diametrical antisymmetry as the `` butterfly asymmetry . ''",
    "our images provide the first credible look at the surface brightness along the disk s projected minor axis .",
    "the convex isophotes in this region indicate that the pinched appearances of the disk in the images of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and , to a lesser degree , @xcite are artifacts of oversubtraction of the reference psf and/or self - subtraction of the disk along its minor axis .",
    "other scattered - light images yielded no information in this region because of obscuration by coronagraphic masks @xcite .",
    "our images are tinged by residuals from the imperfect subtraction of the linear psf feature seen in figure  [ abpic ] , but these residuals do not affect the overall contours of the isophotes .",
    "the isophotes are more widely spaced along the northwestern semiminor axis than along the southeastern semiminor axis . such brightness asymmetry in optically thin disks",
    "is often attributed to the enhanced forward - scattering efficiency of the dust , which implies that the side of the disk closer to earth is inclined slightly northwest from the line of sight to the star .",
    "this deduction is consistent with the inclination determined by @xcite from single - scattering models of the surface brightness along the projected major axis of the disk .",
    "@xcite viewed the inner warp as a deformed and thickened region of the disk , perhaps caused and sustained by a planet in an inclined , eccentric orbit within 20  au of @xmath3  pic .",
    "@xcite subsequently interpreted the warp as a blend of two separate disk components , the lesser of which is inclined from the main component by @xmath55 .",
    "the latter interpretation is supported by figure  [ imratio ] , which shows the ratios of our hrc images after and before deconvolution of the off - spot psf .",
    "the division of the psf - deconvolved filter images ( figure  [ bvidisklucy ] ) by their corresponding convolved images ( figure  [ bvidisk ] ) accentuates the small or narrow features in the disk that are most affected by blurring from the instrumental psf .",
    "thus the sharply - peaked midplane of the outer disk appears prominently in figure  [ imratio ] .",
    "the midplane of the inner warp is not as well defined as that of the outer disk , but the apparent separation of the midplanes beyond @xmath56  au from the star indicates that the warp is a distinct secondary disk inclined from , and perhaps originating within , the main disk .    mimicking @xcite , we determined the contributions of the main and secondary disks to the composite vertical scattered - light profile ( i.e. , the scattered - light distribution perpendicular to the midplane of the disk ) by fitting two similar , vertically symmetric profiles to the composite profile as a function of distance from the star . in doing so , we assigned a shape to the individual profiles by qualitatively assessing various analytic functions at a few locations along the disk in our psf - deconvolved images .",
    "we found that a `` hybrid - lorentzian '' function  two lorentzians of different widths whose top and bottom parts , respectively , are smoothly joined at an arbitrary distance from their common centers  satisfactorily matched each individual profile .",
    "( we ascribe no physical significance to this hybrid - lorentzian function , nor do we claim that it uniquely or optimally characterizes each profile . )",
    "we used a non - linear least - squares fitting algorithm based on the levenberg ",
    "marquardt technique @xcite to determine the positions , amplitudes , widths , and top - to - bottom transition zones of the main and secondary hybrid - lorentzian profiles at distances of 30250  au from @xmath3  pic .",
    "the resulting fits of the composite vertical profiles were best in the regions 80130 au from the star , where the two disk components are sufficiently bright and separated to allow unambiguous discrimination of both components .",
    "figure  [ vertprof ] shows the best fits to the composite vertical profiles of both extensions of the disk observed in our f606w image at distances of 100  au from the star .",
    "figure  [ traceprof ] shows the relative positions of the fitted components of the composite vertical profile as a function of distance from @xmath3  pic . for each filter image and disk extension , we performed linear least - squares fits to the traces of the main and secondary disks within the regions where they are accurately identified ( 80250  au for the main disk and approximately 80130  au for the secondary disk ) .",
    "these fits are overplotted in figure  [ traceprof ] .",
    "the relative position angles of the main disk s northeast and southwest extensions ( measured counterclockwise from the horizontal axis ) are about @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "the difference between these position angles is similar to the `` wing - tilt asymmetry '' noted by @xcite at distances of 100450  au from @xmath3  pic .",
    "however , our fitted lines appear to intersect at a point almost coincident with the star , rather than at a point in the southwest extension , as reported by @xcite . expanding",
    "the vertical scale of our traces of the main disk in the f606w image ( figure  [ maintrace ] ) shows that the spine of the northeast extension conforms to the linear fit down to @xmath56  au , at which point the main and secondary disks can no longer be credibly distinguished .",
    "however , the spine of the southwest extension exhibits more curved than linear behavior over the range of the fit .",
    "this bow in the southwest extension appears in our f435w and f814w images with equal clarity and therefore does not appear to be an artifact of our decomposition of the vertical scattered - light profile .",
    "table  [ tiltang ] lists the position angles of the linear fits along each extension of the secondary disk relative to the corresponding fits along the main disk .",
    "the average tilt of the secondary disk s southwest extension matches the @xmath55 derived by @xcite for both extensions .",
    "however , we find that the average tilt of the northeast extension is @xmath59% larger than the values obtained by @xcite and by us for the southwest extension .",
    "extrapolating the linear fits to the secondary disk outward ( figure  [ diskcon ] ) shows that the convex inflections of the butterfly asymmetry are aligned with the secondary disk , which supports the notion that the asymmetry is caused by radiatively expelled dust from the secondary disk @xcite . on the other hand , extending the linear fits to the secondary disk toward @xmath3  pic ( figure  [ traceprof ] ) shows that its nonparallel extensions would not converge near the star if they extended sufficiently inward .",
    "instead , the northeast extension would intersect the northeast extension of the main disk at a distance of @xmath47  au from @xmath3  pic .",
    "coronagraphic images with a smaller occulting spot and higher pixel resolution are needed to determine if this intersection actually occurs .",
    "although our analysis of the two - component structure of the disk qualitatively supports that of @xcite , our results reveal some errors in the presentation and interpretation of their results .",
    "these errors stem from the incorrect portrayal of the secondary disk s tilt relative to the northeast and southwest extensions of the main disk in figures  1113 of @xcite . in these figures , the plotted data  and consequently the relative slope of the secondary disk  are inverted about the midplane of the main disk .",
    "the orientations of the main and secondary disks should appear as they do in figures  [ imratio][traceprof ] of this paper and in figures  8 and 10 of @xcite .",
    "because of this inversion , @xcite concluded that the disk s southeast side was brighter than its northwest side and , consequently , that the southeast side was inclined toward the line of sight .",
    "these conclusions are not supported by our isophotal map of the disk ( figure  [ diskcon ] ) or by the single - scattering models of @xcite .",
    "previous scattered - light studies indicated that the composite disk is uniformly thick within @xmath60 ( 135  au ) of @xmath3  pic and flared beyond that region @xcite .",
    "these characteristics are evident in figures  [ bvispine ] and [ bvispinelucy ] . previous measurements of the disk s full width at half its midplane ( fwhm ) brightness vary significantly , however , which suggests that the disk s intrinsic projected width is less than or comparable to the resolution of the images from which the measurements were made . our deconvolution of the off - spot psf from the hrc images  the first such effort exhibited for scattered - light images of @xmath3  pic s disk  permits us to assess this resolution dependency and to measure more accurately the intrinsic width of the disk as a function of distance from @xmath3  pic .",
    "figure  [ diskwidth606 ] shows the full widths of each extension of the composite disk at half and one tenth of the maximum brightness of the midplane at distances 20250  au from the star .",
    "these widths are shown in the panels labeled `` fwhm '' and `` fw0.1 m , '' respectively .",
    "the associated pairs of thin solid and dashed curves show the widths of the northeast and southwest extensions obtained from the f606w image before and after psf deconvolution .",
    "the short , thick curves show the measured widths of the hybrid - lorentzian curves that best fit the main component of the composite disk in the region 80150  au from @xmath3  pic (  [ mainsec ] ) .",
    "the fwhm and fw0.1 m plots show progressive reductions in the measured width of the main disk after psf deconvolution and decomposition of the main and secondary disks .",
    "the up - to-30% reduction in the fwhm after deconvolution of the narrow off - spot psf ( fwhm @xmath61  005 ) shows that previously reported measurements , particularly those obtained from the ground , reflect more the angular resolution of the observations than the intrinsic thickness of the disk .",
    "the deconvolved and decomposed curves show that the fwhm and fw0.1 m of both disk extensions are nearly constant ( @xmath6213  au and @xmath760  au , respectively ) within @xmath6  au of @xmath3  pic , and they increase approximately linearly with distance beyond @xmath6  au .",
    "this behavior is consistently seen in the f435w , f606w , and f814w images .",
    "the southwest extension appears to thicken more rapidly than the northeast extension beyond @xmath63  au , as noted by @xcite , but the correlated noise injected into the deconvolved images by the lucy ",

    "the former trend suggests that the colors in the northeast extension become bluer with increasing distance from @xmath3  pic .",
    "altogether , these characteristics indicate that the grain populations and/or distributions in the main and secondary disks differ significantly at common projected distances from the star . moreover , if unresolved , the secondary disk can significantly affect models that use the scattered - light profiles to constrain the spatial distribution and composition of dust in the main disk .      previous multiband - imaging studies of @xmath3  pic s disk showed that the optical colors of the star and disk are indistinguishable within the studies estimated photometric errors @xcite .",

    "it is especially important for multiband imaging studies designed to map the chromatic dependencies of a disk s morphology and surface brightness .",
    "for example , psf deconvolution dispels the illusion that @xmath3  pic s disk thickens with increasing wavelength ( figures  [ bvispine ] and [ bvispinelucy ] ) by restoring the displaced red flux to its original location along the disk s spine .",
    "this restoration of the true surface - brightness distribution contributes largely to our observation that the main disk component is significantly redder than previously determined from ground - based measurements @xcite .",

    "multicomponent , nonaxisymmetric models are clearly needed to reproduce the complicated scattered - light distribution associated with @xmath3  pic s disk .",

    "the horizontal surface - brightness profiles of the main disk within @xmath87  au are sensitive to contamination by flux from the secondary disk .",
    "models of the dust distribution within either disk should be based on deconvolved and deblended components of scattered light from both disks .",
    "2 .   the spines of the opposing extensions of the secondary disk are not collinear . while the misaligned spines of the main disk ( dubbed the  wing - tilt  asymmetry by",
    "* ) are attributed to forward scattering from a slightly inclined disk , those of the secondary disk are not as easily explained .",
    "the possible optical and/or dynamical causes of this phenomenon need to be explored .",
    "3 .   the clumpiness noted in mid - infrared images of the disk is not observed in optical scattered light , even though the grains believed responsible for the clumps of mid - infrared emission @xcite have sizes commensurate with efficient scattering of optical light .",
    "this apparent incompatibility may indicate that the scattered light and thermal emission come from different regions along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "if so , these disparate observations may constrain the mean scattering properties of the grains .",
    "4 .   the optical colors of the composite disk are asymmetric about both projected axes of the disk .",
    "the generally redder and brighter appearance of the northwest half of the disk is inconsistent with the expectation that the dust grains scatter red light more isotropically than blue light .",
    "this peculiar behavior may place interesting constraints on the sizes and compositions of the grains throughout the disk .",
    "the prominent changes in the horizontal surface - brightness profiles and color gradients at @xmath13  au from @xmath3  pic suggest that these phenomena may have a common cause .",
    "the expected sublimation of water ice from micron - sized grains lying within @xmath18  au of the star @xcite is one possible cause , but color variations caused by changes in the grain - size distribution must also be investigated .",
    "although we defer these issues to future theoretical investigations , we partly address the last issue here via a one - dimensional analysis of the colors observed along the spines of the component disks .",
    "@xcite successfully modeled the disk s continuum emission from near - infrared to millimeter wavelengths and its @xmath19 m silicate emission feature by assuming that the dust is continually replenished by comets orbiting near , or falling onto , @xmath3  pic . in this scenario ,",
    "the cometary dust grains are highly porous aggregates of primitive interstellar dust whose composition , molecular structure , and size and spatial distributions are altered by the stellar radiation environments into which they are sputtered and transported .",
    "@xcite did not apply this dust model to the disk s appearance in scattered light because the scattering properties of highly porous grains with appropriate compositions had not been fully determined .",
    "subsequent modeling of these properties @xcite now enables us to examine the porous - grain model from the perspective of the disk s optical colors .",
    "we begin by deriving a parameter that , in the absence of a detailed three - dimensional model of the disk , links the optical properties of a variety of grains with the colors observed along the spine of the disk .",
    "we apply this parameter first to the colors of the composite disk ( figure  [ colors ] ) , as these colors are largely attributable to the main disk and their uncertainties are well established . afterwards",

    "however , as noted by @xcite , the values of @xmath143 for smaller grains ( @xmath153@xmath23 m ) are also similar among the broad optical bands , so some submicron - sized grains are also neutral scatterers at these wavelengths . moreover , because small grains likely dominate the size distribution of grains in the disk @xcite , they more strongly influence the overall color of the disk than supermicron - sized grains .",
    "nevertheless , the truly red colors of @xmath3  pic s composite disk ( figure  [ colors ] ) makes the debate over the cause of neutral colors in this case irrelevant .",

    "however , they do show that very porous grains do not contribute significantly to the integrated scattered light along the spine .",
    "this conclusion does not necessarily imply a lack of very porous grains , because the values of @xmath175 for such grains with @xmath176 m are 1020 times smaller than those of compact and moderately porous grains of similar size ( figure  [ qmean ] ) .",
    "thus , our results do not necessarily contradict those of @xcite , who found that the dust models that best fitted the observed continuum and @xmath19 m silicate emission from the disk are those that feature extremely porous ( @xmath177% ) grains .",
    "it remains to be seen , however , whether a distribution of grain porosities can simultaneously satisfy the constraints provided by scattered - light and thermal images of the inner disk .",
    "our estimate of @xmath174@xmath16 m within 120  au matches that obtained by @xcite using ground - based observations of the disk s colors and polarization beyond 115  au @xcite and a dust model featuring an @xmath83-band refractive index of @xmath178 and a grain - size distribution of @xmath179 .",
    "this refractive index is descriptive of both `` dirty - ice '' grains with 50% porosity and astrosil grains of 76% porosity .",
    "however , our hrc images show that the disk steadily reddens beyond 120  au , so the other dust models considered by @xcite  and rejected because they produced colors that were too red compared with the nearly neutral colors observed from the ground  are in fact potentially viable models for this region of the disk .",

    "although tabulated values of @xmath136 and @xmath129 have not yet been published for moderately porous astrosil grains with icy mantles , it is reasonable to expect that the optical colors of an edge - on disk of such grains vary with @xmath163 in a manner similar to those depicted in figures  [ dcolors]a  d .",
    "if so , then the increasingly red color gradient observed in @xmath3  pic s disk beyond 120  au ( figure  [ colors ] ) may reflect values of @xmath163 that increase with distance from @xmath182 m to perhaps @xmath183 m at 250  au @xcite .",
    "a similar trend was proposed by @xcite , based on the disappearance of the @xmath19 m silicate emission feature beyond 20  au of the star .",
    "these phenomena are consistent with the scenario of a diminished presence of small ( @xmath184@xmath181 m ) grains near the ice - sublimation zone ( @xmath185  au ) , where cometary activity ceases @xcite and radiation pressure sets @xmath163 to 1@xmath19 m , depending on porosity @xcite .",
    "the steeper color gradients in the southwest extension of the disk suggest that @xmath163 increases more rapidly in that extension , i.e. , the number of small grains in the southwest extension is smaller than in the northeast extension .",
    "this suggestion is consistent with the observed asymmetry between the polarizations of the two extensions @xcite , which has been attributed to a 20 - 30% larger population of small grains in the northeast extension @xcite .",
    "the largely uncertain colors of the secondary disk (  [ componentcolor ] ) prevent us from rigorously comparing the grain characteristics of the main and secondary disks .",
    "however , the lack of inflections in the secondary disk s color and surface - brightness profiles ( figure  [ mainsecprof ] ) indicates that the grain populations of the two component disks are fundamentally different at 80150  au from the star .",
    "if the inflections in the main disk s profiles at @xmath13  au are solely caused by ice sublimation , then the composition and/or size distribution of the secondary disk s grains must be sufficiently different from those of the main disk that the ice - sublimation boundary in the secondary disk ( if it exists ) lies within or beyond the 80150  au range of our analysis .",
    "more precise photometry of the secondary disk is needed to determine whether the differences in the grains composition or size distribution required for such a boundary shift are compatible with the colors of the disk .",
    "@xcite argued that icy grains should not exist anywhere in @xmath3  pic s disk because they quickly photoevaporate in the face of the star s strong ultraviolet flux and because they are structurally brittle and unable to survive high - velocity collisions with other grains .",
    "if so , then other causes of the differences between the color and surface - brightness profiles of the main and secondary disks must be considered .",
    "for example , the inflections in the main disk s profiles at @xmath13  au may reflect a sharp decrease in the number density of grains within that distance from the star .",
    "@xcite successfully modeled the inflection in the surface - brightness profile by imposing a lower limit on the sizes of comets or asteroids that travel from outer regions of the disk and retain enough volatile material to evaporate within 110  au .",
    "if this scenario is correct , then the lack of inflections in the secondary disk s profiles suggests that most of its dust is produced by colliding or evaporating planetesimals orbiting near the star rather than by evaporating comets with large , eccentric orbits .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the hypothesis that the `` warp '' in the composite disk is caused by radiation - blown dust from colliding planetesimals that have been perturbed from the the innermost part of the main disk by a giant planet in an inclined orbit @xcite .",
    "recent photometric studies of kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) reveal that these objects exhibit a broad range of optical and near - infrared colors @xcite .",
    "growing ( but controversial ) evidence suggests that kbos are divided by their perihelia , @xmath186 , into two color populations : kbos with @xmath187  au have neutral - to - red intrinsic colors , and kbos with @xmath188  au have only red intrinsic colors ( @xmath189@xmath190 , relative to the sun ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a possible cause of this color trend is the diminution of collisions and/or cometary activity in the outer kuiper belt @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis rests on the notion that the `` dirty - ice '' surfaces of kbos are progressively polymerized and reddened by high - energy solar and cosmic radiation unless they are recoated with primordial dust ejected by collisions between kbos or the sublimation of h@xmath191o , co@xmath191 , and co ices .",
    "the observed reddening of @xmath3  pic s disk beyond its ice - sublimation zone suggests a possible connection with the reddening of distant kbos .",
    "could the reddening of @xmath3  pic s disk beyond @xmath13  au be the result of irradiative polymerization rather than an increasing minimum grain size ?",
    "@xcite simulated the rate of irradiative reddening of kbos using an inverse exponential function with an @xmath192-folding time of @xmath193  yr . because the radiation is overwhelmingly solar within the heliopause @xcite , we crudely apply this function to the region of @xmath3  pic s disk in our fov by assuming that the @xmath192-folding time scales with luminosity and the distance from the star .",
    "in this situation , the @xmath0@xmath1 color of long - lived icy grains orbiting @xmath3  pic ( @xmath194 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would increase by @xmath195  mag in a few times @xmath196  yr . the lifetimes of grains not quickly expelled from the disk by radiation pressure are limited by either poynting  robertson drag or intergrain collisions , depending on their size and location within the disk . at 120250  au ,",
    "the minimum lifetimes of grains larger than @xmath197 m are constrained by collisions to @xmath962  myr @xcite .",
    "thus , the lifetimes of the grains observed in our hrc images are much too short for the observed color gradient to be caused by irradiative reddening .",
    "this condition likely persists throughout the outer disk , because the grain lifetimes beyond @xmath198  au ( which are limited by poynting ",

    "the possibility that au  mic s disk contains smaller or more porous grains than are evident in @xmath3  pic s inner disk (  [ innerdisk ] ) is consistent with the much lower radiation pressure exerted on such grains by au  mic than by @xmath3  pic @xcite . on the other hand , the measured f435w ",
    "f814w  @xmath203 at 60  au from the star can not be produced by any combination of grain composition and porosity shown in figure  [ dcolors ] , so the grains in au  mic s disk may have a different mineral composition altogether .",

    "the opposing extensions of the secondary disk are not collinear , but their outwardly projected midplanes ( spines ) are coincident with the isophotal inflections previously seen at large distances and commonly called the `` butterfly asymmetry '' @xcite . the surface brightness profiles along the spines of the secondary disk from 80 to 150  au can be fit with single power - law functions having indices of @xmath204 .",
    "the lack of inflections in the surface brightness profiles around the expected ice - sublimation boundary ( @xmath18  au ) suggests that the composition and/or size distribution of grains in the secondary disk is different from those of the main disk .",

    "we confirm the `` wing - tilt asymmetry '' between the opposing extensions of the main disk , but we find that the effect is centered on the star rather than offset toward the southwest extension @xcite . while the spine of the northeast extension appears linear 80250  au from the star , the southwest spine is distinctly bowed with an amplitude of @xmath5  au .",

    "this discrepancy can not be attributed to differences in the instrumental psfs .",
    "the indices within 150  au change significantly after removing the contribution from the secondary disk , so the superposed effects of both disks must be considered in future models of @xmath3  pic s circumstellar dust distribution .",

    "<S> we present f435w ( @xmath0 ) , f606w ( broad @xmath1 ) , and f814w ( broad @xmath2 ) coronagraphic images of the debris disk around @xmath3  pictoris obtained with the _ hubble space telescope s _ advanced camera for surveys . </S>",
    "<S> these images provide the most photometrically accurate and morphologically detailed views of the disk between 30 and 300  au from the star ever recorded in scattered light . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that the previously reported warp in the inner disk is a distinct secondary disk inclined by @xmath4 from the main disk . the projected spine of the secondary disk coincides with the isophotal inflections , or `` butterfly asymmetry , '' previously seen at large distances from the star . </S>",
    "<S> we also confirm that the opposing extensions of the main disk have different position angles , but we find that this `` wing - tilt asymmetry '' is centered on the star rather than offset from it as previously reported . </S>",
    "<S> the main disk s northeast extension is linear from 80 to 250  au , but the southwest extension is distinctly bowed with an amplitude of @xmath5  au over the same region . </S>",
    "<S> both extensions of the secondary disk appear linear , but not collinear , from 80 to 150  au . within @xmath6  </S>",
    "<S> au of the star , the main disk is @xmath7% thinner than previously reported . </S>",
    "<S> the surface - brightness profiles along the spine of the main disk are fitted with four distinct radial power laws between 40 and 250  au , while those of the secondary disk between 80 and 150  au are fitted with single power laws . </S>",
    "<S> these discrepancies suggest that the two disks have different grain compositions or size distributions </S>",
    "<S> . the f606w / f435w and f814w / f435w flux ratios of the composite disk are nonuniform and asymmetric about both projected axes of the disk . </S>",
    "<S> the disk s northwest region appears 2030% redder than its southeast region , which is inconsistent with the notion that forward scattering from the nearer northwest side of the disk should diminish with increasing wavelength . within @xmath6  </S>",
    "<S> au , the @xmath8@xmath9 and @xmath8@xmath10 colors along the spine of the main disk are @xmath11% and @xmath12% redder , respectively , than those of @xmath3  pic . </S>",
    "<S> these colors increasingly redden beyond @xmath6  au , becoming 25% and 40% redder , respectively , than the star at 250  au . </S>",
    "<S> these measurements overrule previous determinations that the disk is composed of neutrally scattering grains . </S>",
    "<S> the change in color gradient at @xmath6  au nearly coincides with the prominent inflection in the surface - brightness profile at @xmath13  au and the expected water - ice sublimation boundary . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the observed red colors within @xmath6  au with the simulated colors of non - icy grains having a radial number density @xmath14 and different compositions , porosities , and minimum grain sizes . </S>",
    "<S> the observed colors are consistent with those of compact or moderately porous grains of astronomical silicate and/or graphite with sizes @xmath15@xmath16 m , but the colors are inconsistent with the blue colors expected from grains with porosities @xmath17% . </S>",
    "<S> the increasingly red colors beyond the ice - sublimation zone may indicate the condensation of icy mantles on the refractory grains , or they may reflect an increasing minimum grain size caused by the cessation of cometary activity . </S>"
