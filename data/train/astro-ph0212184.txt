    "whether galaxy mergers ( e.g.  kauffmann et al .  1996 ) or instead disk instabilities ( pfenniger & norman 1990 ) may be viewed as the dominant process of formation and growth of the central bulges in spiral and s0 galaxies depends to some extent on the shape of the surface brightness profiles of bulges .",

    "1990 ) .    over the past decade",

    "no internal extinction corrections were applied . a quasi - newton algorithm ( kahaner ,",

    "such srsic - exponential bulge - disk fits , covering the entire radial range down to 0.075 , tend to show strong residuals , up to 0.3 mag , over the entire bulge .",
    "a typical example is shown in figure  [ fig : exampleprofile]a .",
    "the residual profile shows a characteristic wave pattern .",
    "this is caused by a strong central light excess , as inferred from fits excluding the central 1 - 2 arcsec .",
    "we then run the fitting code including either an additional central delta function point source ( ps ) ; a central exponential ; a point source plus an exponential ; or a central gaussian component with free fwhm to the fitting function . in all cases",
    "each component is psf - convolved before fitting . for each galaxy",
    "we select the simplest fit , i.e. minimum number of components , for which the residual profile falls below an amplitude of 0.1 mag/(arcsec)@xmath17 .",
    "figure  [ fig : exampleprofile]b shows the profile from figure  [ fig : exampleprofile]a fitted with an additional central ps , which yields an excellent fit .",
    "the total light in the inner 1 - 2 \" can also be approximated with power laws ( balcells et al .",
    "2001 ; bker et al .",
    "the nuker model also fits the inner few arcsec of the early - type galaxy profiles well ( byun et al.1996 ) .",
    "however , these approaches break down further out ( e.g. lauer et al .",
    "1995 ) , do not allow a bulge - disk decomposition , and are not discussed further here .",
    "our fits extend over 2.5 decades in radius , and describe both bulge and disk .",
    "-0.3cms        of the 19 galaxies , 12 yield a satisfactory fit with the addition of a single ps , 2 with the addition of a single nuclear exponential , 4 with a ps plus an exponential , and one with a pure srsic bulge .",
    "the frequency of ps is thus @xmath18% , and that of inner exponentials is @xmath19% .",
    "only one galaxy ( ngc  5577 , sbc ) does not require an unresolved source and can be fit with a simple srsic bulge plus exponential disk ; however , the profile for this galaxy has lower s / n than the others owing to its lower surface brightness .",
    "most galaxies with pss yield a good fit with a gaussian inner component instead ; in those cases , the fwhm of the inner gaussian , before psf convolution , is generally well below the psf fwhm , recovering the ps solution .",
    "some galaxies with inner exponential components also admit a good fit with a marginally resolved gaussian instead .",
    "because these galaxies show high ellipticity and pointy isophotes in the nuclear region , we choose the ps - plus - exponential fit instead of the gaussian inner component .",
    "nuclear isophotes are described in paper iii .",
    "the srsic index  for the bulges ranges from 0.5 to 3.0 , with a mean of @xmath20n@xmath21 .",
    "the range is significantly lower than that obtained by apb95 using ground - based data alone , which reaches @xmath22 : figure  [ fig : nvstvsbdvsmkdej]b shows that  is systematically lower than , especially for galaxies with @xmath23 .",
    "none of our bulges reaches the de vaucouleurs 14behaviour .",
    "it appears that fits to ground - based profiles reach srsic indices @xmath24 because the light from _ hst_-unresolved central sources , plus in some instances nuclear disks or bars , when convolved with typical ground - based seeing , link smoothly with the the extended bulge profile and mimic higher-@xmath3 srsic profiles .",
    "figures  [ fig : nvstvsbdvsmkdej]c , d plot the distribution of vs.  the bulge - to - disk luminosity ratio ( b / d ) and bulge @xmath9-band absolute magnitude , respectively .",
    "b / d are derived from the best - fit parameters .",
    "bulge absolute magnitudes are derived from the galaxy @xmath9-band magnitude given in apb95 and our computed b / d . as noted by apb95 , some of the galaxy magnitudes",
    "are probably slightly underestimated when the galaxy overfills the frame .",
    "figures  [ fig : nvstvsbdvsmkdej]c , d show that log ( ) correlates with log(b / d ) and with the bulge absolute @xmath9-band magnitude ( spearman rank - order correlation coefficients -0.52 and -0.51 , significances 97.8% and 97.4% , respectively ) .",
    "thus , the correlation of srsic index @xmath3 with b / d and bulge luminosity found in ground - based data ( apb95 ; graham 2001 ) remains valid when fits including central ps components are used .",
    "we compare our _ hst_-based @xmath3 distributions to those obtained by graham ( 2001 ) using the sample of spirals of de jong ( 1996 ) ( figure  [ fig : nvstvsbdvsmkdej]c , d , cross symbols ) .",
    "the loci occupied by the two samples are similar .",
    "a trend with morphological type t ( figure  [ fig : nvstvsbdvsmkdej]a ) is apparent when our distribution is extended to later types by adding values from the graham ( 2001 ) analysis .",
    "we showed in  [ sec : fits ] that , for 16 out of the 19 galaxies studied , adding a central ps improves the fit to the observed profile .",
    "absolute @xmath25-band magnitudes for the ps are in the range @xmath26 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath27 with morphological type t is quite flat ( figure  [ fig : ptsrc]a ) . @xmath27",
    "correlates with @xmath28 and with @xmath29 ( spearman rank - order correlation coefficients of -0.63 and 0.77 , significances 99.6% and 99.96% , respectively ) , see figures  [ fig : ptsrc]b , c . the line in figure  [ fig : ptsrc]c is an orthogonal regression to the @xmath30 relation , which yields    @xmath31    using a constant color @xmath32 for the nuclei ( persson , frogel & aaronson 1979 ) .",
    "nuclear sources have been reported in previous studies of early - type galaxy profiles based on _ hst _ imaging .",
    "carollo et al .",
    "( 2002 ) detect nuclear sources in 43 of their 69 late - type galaxies , with absolute magnitudes @xmath33 .",
    "the bright end is similar to ours .",
    "the fainter luminosities are consistent with the expected low bulge luminosity of their later type galaxies , although the lack of a bulge - disk decomposition prevents us from comparing theirs and our trends of ps luminosity with spheroid luminosity .",
    "ravindranath et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , using two - dimensional fits to _",
    "hst_/nicmos f160w images of an e / s0 sample , report unresolved central components for @xmath050% of their targets . figure  [ fig : ptsrc]d shows their distribution of point source magnitude vs.  absolute @xmath34-band galaxy magnitude together with our distribution of ps magnitude vs.  @xmath34-band absolute bulge magnitude ;",
    "the latter was computed using the @xmath35 galaxy magnitudes from the rc3 and the bulge - disk ratio derived from the _ hst_+ground - based profile fits .",
    "their point source magnitudes are slightly fainter than ours . their fainter ps magnitudes and their lower detection rate may be consequences of their choice of the nuker model vs.  our use of the srsic model to fit the underlying bulge light distribution ; the nuker law is steeper than the srsic law near the origin , and diverges at @xmath36 , whereas the srsic law has a finite value of @xmath37 .",
    "also , using galaxy magnitudes for their sample instead of bulge magnitudes shifts their points to the right in the diagram .",
    "measuring the correct value of the srsic index @xmath3 for bulges is important for several reasons . overestimating @xmath3 leads to an overestimate of the bulge @xmath38 and luminosity .",
    "trujillo et al .  ( 2001 ) show that fitting an @xmath4 profile with a 14  function yields an overestimate of @xmath38 by a factor of 3 - 5 and of the bulge luminosity by a factor of about 2 .",
    "the luminosity ratio b / d is further overestimated as more of the light in the bulge - disk transition region is assigned to the bulge .",
    "the converse occurs when @xmath3 is underestimated , eg .  when exponential fits are forced onto @xmath39 srsic profiles ( graham 2001 ) .",
    "thus , small luminosity components ( typically @xmath40 , eqn .",
    "1 ) may significantly alter the derived global parameters of bulges .",
    "test fits excluding inner profile regions suggest that , in the absence of _ hst _ imaging , the effects of central components on the bulge shape index @xmath3 are greatly diminished by excluding the central fwhm of the profile , as done by stiavelli et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for dwarf ellipticals .",
    "point sources should present less of a problem for late - type spirals given the low srsic indices , low bulge luminosities and hence low ps luminosities expected from figure  [ fig : ptsrc]c .",
    "the nuclear pss , amounting to a fraction of order @xmath41 of the bulge luminosities , are easy to accomodate within either a merger origin or a secular evolution origin for bulges .",
    "the observed scaling of ps and bulge luminosities need not indicate an internal origin for the ps as nuclear gas deposition during a merger may scale with the masses of the merging objects . if bulges are evolved bars , the problem of growing a nuclear star cluster is similar to that of feeding an active galactic nucleus ( maciejewski et al .",
    "2002 ) .    given the persistent description of bulges as 14  spheroids in galaxy formation models , it is worth pointing out that none of the bulges follow the 14  law . apb95 , de jong ( 1996 ) , graham ( 2001 ) and macarthur et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have shown that late- to intermediate - type bulges have @xmath42 profiles in the range @xmath43 .",
    "our work establishes a similar range , @xmath44 , for intermediate- to early - type bulges i.e. those which are still generally described with the 14  model . extrapolating from the rising envelope of the @xmath3 ",
    "@xmath45 relation in figure  [ fig : nvstvsbdvsmkdej]d , only bulges with @xmath46 may reach @xmath47 .",
    "the 14  law is interpreted as the consequence of violent relaxation during a clumpy collapse ( van albada 1982 ) , and is obtained after mergers of similar - size disk galaxies ( barnes 1988 ) .",
    "simulations of collisionless satellite accretion onto bulge - disk galaxies further show that bulges evolve smoothly from exponential profiles to 14  profiles when doubling their mass due to accretion events ( abp01 ) . at face value",
    "then , our distribution of srsic shape indices @xmath3 ( figure  [ fig : nvstvsbdvsmkdej]c , d ) suggests that the vast majority of bulges did not acquire their present structural properties by growing through collisionless mergers .",
    "kinematic data might show whether , besides a low srsic index @xmath3 , these bulges show other properties typical of disks ( kormendy 1993 ; falcn - barroso et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "have deviations from the 14  law in @xmath48-body models gone undetected ?",
    "srsic fitting is only starting to be applied in @xmath48-body studies .",
    "hjorth & madsen ( 1995 ) show that violent relaxation in a finite volume , combined with subsequent escape of positive - energy stars , leads to a distribution function with deviations from the 14  law ; from their figures , a shallow central potential might possibly fit @xmath49 srsic profiles .",
    "accretion of low - mass satellites might heat the bulge only moderately and deposite the compact satellite nucleus at the center of the remnant .",
    "this could lead to a @xmath50 bulge with a central brightness spike not unlike what is observed .",
    "but very long merger times and slow growth rate for low - mass satellites are a problem for this hypothesis .",
    "recent cosmological sph simulations of galaxy formation ( scannapieco & tissera 2002 ) find @xmath51 for bulges resulting from secular evolution , while merging rises @xmath3 to about @xmath47 , again pointing at low-@xmath3 profiles being related to non - merger formation histories .",
