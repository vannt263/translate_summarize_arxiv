    "spectropolarimetric observations with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( ) have revealed an unexpected rise in linear polarization in several qsos ( see review by koratkar & blaes 1999 ) .",
    "these are radio quiet `` candidate lyman edge qsos '' , in which the continuum flux drops rather rapidly at rest wavelengths @xmath3     ( antonucci , kinney , & ford 1989 ; koratkar , kinney & bohlin 1992 ) . models of accretion disk atmospheres predicted a reduced polarization in the lyman continuum because of a diminished contribution of electron scattering to the opacity ( laor , netzer , & piran 1990 ) . with this motivation ,",
    "impey  ( 1995 ) and koratkar  ( 1995 ) used the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) on   to obtain ultraviolet spectropolarimetry of several qsos with redshifts sufficient to bring the lyman continuum within the observed wavelength band .",
    "the surprising result , in several cases , was a rapid _ rise _ in polarization in the lyman continuum . from values",
    "@xmath4 percent in the optical and near ultraviolet , the observed polarization rises around rest wavelength 750    to values @xmath5 percent in several objects , and to @xmath6 percent in pg 1630 + 377 .",
    "this phenomenon has inspired several attemps at explanation .",
    "blaes and agol ( 1996 ) found that , for effective temperatures @xmath7  k and low effective gravities , a polarization rise of up to @xmath5  percent at about the observed wavelength could occur naturally in qso disk atmospheres .",
    "this results from the interplay of electron scattering , bound - free opacity , and the temperature gradient in the atmosphere .",
    "however , shields , wobus , and husfeld ( 1998 , hereinafter swh ) showed that the effects of the relativistic transfer function destroy the agreement between this model and observation .",
    "beloborodov and poutanen ( 1999 ) suggested a model involving compton scattering in a corona or wind , but this model appears to have trouble giving the rapid rise in polarized flux observed in pg 1630 + 377 ( blaes & shields 1999 ) .",
    "lee and blandford ( 1997 ) discussed the possible role of scattering by resonance lines of heavy elements ( see section 5 ) .",
    "swh showed that , if the polarization is assumed to rise sharply at @xmath1 in the rest frame of the orbiting gas , then relativistic effects would naturally produce the wavelength dependence of the observed polarization .",
    "this may offer a way of measuring the black hole spin , but the physical mechanism for the polarization rise remains unknown .",
    "pg 1222 + 228 is a @xmath8 radio quiet qso ( schmidt & green 1983 ) whose polarization rise at @xmath9    coincides with a sharp drop in flux ( fig . 1 , 2 ) .",
    "impey  ( 1995 ) noted this and attributed it to a coincidental lyman limit system ( lls ) , corresponding to an identified absorption line system at z = 1.486 .",
    "however , the coincidence of a broad absorption feature with a polarization rise also is observed for broad absorption line ( bal ) qsos . in these objects ,",
    "outflowing gas at velocities @xmath10 produces blueshifted absorption troughs , typically seen in the resonance lines of h i , c iv , n v , o vi , si iv , and sometimes mg ii ( weymann  1991 ; arav , shlosman , & weymann 1997 ) .",
    "spectropolarimetric observations ( , ogle 1997 ; schmidt & hines 1999 ; ogle  1999 ) often show a rise in polarization in the troughs , reaching values as high as @xmath11 to 10 percent from @xmath12 percent at unabsorbed wavelengths .",
    "this is explained in terms of scattering of some of the continuum by an extended region that is not covered by the bal flow ( hines & wills 1995 ; goodrich & miller 1995 ; cohen  1995 ) .",
    "this pattern resembles the polarization rise and flux drop in pg 1222 + 228 .",
    "this paper addresses two questions : ( 1 ) does the polarization rise in pg 1222 + 228 result from an intrinsic absorber , analagous to the situation in the bal qsos ? ( 2 )",
    "if the drop in flux in pg 1222 + 228 is an intervening lls , what are the consequences of correcting the observed , polarized continuum for this absorption ?",
    "we first consider the possibility that the flux drop and coincidental polarization rise in pg 1222 + 228 results from some kind of intrinsic absorption .",
    "two possibilities , considered below , are that it is a bal outflow , or that it is an unusual , intrinsic lls .    in either case ,",
    "one issue is the behavior of the polarized flux as a function of wavelength . as discussed above , if the polarization rise results from the selective absorption of the directly viewed continuum but not the scattered continuum , one might expect a smaller drop ( but generally not a rise ) in the polarized flux , @xmath13 . in order to examine this , we have rebinned the data of impey  ( 1995 ) , kindly made available in reduced form by c. impey and c. petri ( 1999 ) .",
    "these data consist of a spectrum with the g190h grating covering @xmath14 to 2320 at 0.37    per pixel , and a spectrum with the g270h grating covering the range 2224 to 3295 at 0.52  per pixel .",
    "the g190h data shortward of @xmath15 have low signal - to - noise and were not presented by impey  ( 1995 ) .",
    "we used seven wavelength bins ( in  ) : ( 1)19942224 , ( 2 ) 22242287 , ( 3 ) 22872319 , ( 4 ) 23192492 , ( 5 ) 24922761 , ( 6 ) 27613029 , ( 7 ) 30293295 .",
    "bins 2 and 3 involve an average of the two overlapping spectra , and bin 3 is a narrow bin containing the flux drop at @xmath16 .",
    "the resulting values of , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are tabulated in table 1 , along with the polarization , @xmath19 , and its position angle , @xmath20 . for the polarized flux , we use the rotated stokes flux @xmath21 and polarization @xmath22 (   koratkar etal  1995 ) , referred to a position angle of 168 degrees .",
    "this is based on the mean polarization position angle of the hst data , which is in reasonable agreement with optical observations ( stockman  1984 ; webb  1993 ) .",
    "( the use of @xmath23 is appropriate if the position angle of the polarization is constant with wavelength .",
    "table 1 supports this and also shows that the polarization @xmath24 is reasonably consistent with @xmath23 . )",
    "these quantities are plotted in figure 2 .",
    "the shortest wavelength bin has larger polarized flux than the longer wavelength bins . at face value",
    ", this would weigh against an intrinsic absorber model for pg 1222 + 228 ; but it involves a single wavelength bin with substantial error bars .",
    "therefore , we consider other aspects of the two outflow models .",
    "the rest wavelength of the onset of the absorption feature in pg 1222 + 228 is @xmath25   . some bal qsos show absorption by ne viii @xmath26775 ( , arav  1999 ; telfer  1999 ) .",
    "this might be a candidate for the feature in question , in as much as bals often set in at a wavelength somewhat blueshifted from the emission - line redshift .",
    "however , ne viii normally is accompanied by absorption in o vi @xmath27 , n v @xmath28 , and c iv @xmath29 .",
    "there is no indication of broad c iv or mg ii absorption in the spectrum of pg 1222 + 228 ( sargent , steidel , & boksenberg 1988 ; steidel & sargent 1992 ) .",
    "the  spectrum shows a shallow trough at @xmath30 to @xmath31 that could be a weak o vi feature ; but this may simply be a cluster of lines , including several strong  lines indentified by impey  ( 1996 ) .",
    "photoionization models by hamann ( 1997 ) indicate a range of ionization parameters for which the fractional abundance of ne@xmath32 exceeds that of o@xmath33 however , given the normal ratio of oxygen to neon abundances , the o vi feature would likely be strong in a situation giving strong ne viii .",
    "the flux drop at @xmath34 does not recover , with decreasing wavelength , in a way suggestive of a bal ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the spectrum has not fully recovered by rest wavelength 650   , corresponding to an an outflow velocity of more than 40,000  if attributed to ne viii .",
    "some moderately narrow `` mini - bal '' features have been observed at such high velocities ( hamann   1997 ) , but true bal troughs rarely reach such velocities .",
    "the same can be said in connection with the possibility that the @xmath34 feature corresponds to a blend of features including n iii , n iv , o iv , s vi , and ne viii seen in bal qso spectra at this wavelength ( , arav  1999 ) .",
    "moreover , given the range of ionization stages contributing to this blend , c iv and si iv absorption would likely accompany it .",
    "recent work has shown that bal qsos systematically have weak soft x - ray emission .",
    "bal qsos have optical to x - ray slopes @xmath35 , whereas nonbal qsos tend to have @xmath36 in the range -1.3 to -1.8 ( brandt , laor , and wills 1999 ) . here",
    ", @xmath36 is defined by @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the flux densities ( @xmath40 ) at 2 kev and 3000   , respectively .",
    "rosat pointing observations give a flux of @xmath41 for pg 1222 + 228 at a significance level of @xmath42 ( mushotzky 1999 ) .",
    "if we assume a `` normal '' power - law slope of @xmath43 over the 0.2 to 2 kev rosat band ( brandt  1999 ) , we find @xmath44 at 2 kev rest energy .",
    "optical spectrophotometry ( wampler & ponz 1985 ; bechtold  1984 ) implies @xmath45 at rest wavelength 3000   . ( these are observed fluxes at the wavelength corresponding to the indicated rest wavelength . ) from this , we find @xmath46 for pg 1222 + 228 .",
    "this result is uncertain because of the marginal x - ray detection and the possibility of variability , but at face value it is more consistent with a non - bal than a bal qso .",
    "( wilkes  1994 quote an uncertain value @xmath47 from einstein data . )",
    "we conclude that the flux drop at @xmath34 in pg 1222 + 228 is unlikely to be a bal feature .",
    "impey  ( 1995 ) suggested that the flux drop at @xmath34 was an intervening lls .",
    "we show below that lyman limit absorption does indeed give a good fit to the spectrum .",
    "this fit , however , leaves open the question of the location of the absorbing gas . because of the coincidence with the polarization rise , we consider here the possibility that the feature is an _ intrinsic _ lls , associated with a high velocity outflow from the qso .",
    "impey  ( 1996 ) identify  absorption lines at z = 1.4857 , 1.5238 , 1.5272 , and 1.5650 that might be associated with the @xmath34 feature , if it is taken to be a lls .",
    "a redshift of 1.486 corresponds to an outflow velocity @xmath48 as noted above , this is not unprecedented for a qso outflow producing absorption lines .",
    "however , the lines associated with the redshift systems in question in pg 1222 + 228 are narrow , and narrow lines with relative velocities greater than 5000   usually are assumed to be intervening . for a lyman edge optical depth of unity ,",
    "the measured equivalent widths of the  lines are consistent with a doppler parameter @xmath49 ( see below ) , normal for an intervening lls .",
    "in contrast , the mini - bals observed at such high velocities have widths of order @xmath50 ( hamann  1997 ) .",
    "could the feature in pg 1222 + 228 nevertheless be caused by ejected material with a high outflow velocity and a small velocity dispersion ?",
    "we are not aware of any other case in which a high velocity lls with narrow lines has been shown to be intrinsic .",
    "however , the existence of many intrinsic , narrow , high velocity absorption systems in qsos has been proposed by richards  ( 1999 ) .",
    "these authors compare the incidence of absorption - line systems , per unit relative outflow velocity , for highly luminous qsos with that for less luminous ones . in the velocity range 5000 to 75,000",
    ", they find that absorption systems have a substantially larger frequency in luminous systems .",
    "since intervening systems should have no dependence on qso luminosity ( assuming that discovery systematics are accounted for ) , richards  conclude that at least the excess number of systems in the high luminosity qsos are intrinsic .",
    "a peculiar absorption line ratio in the z = 1.94 system in pg 1222 + 228 has been noted by ganguly  ( 1998 ) .",
    "these authors present high resolution spectra that show two narrow components , separated by @xmath51 , with very different strengths of the al ii and al iii absorption lines .",
    "photoionization models indicate that the component with strong aluminum lines must have an anomalously high abundance of aluminum .",
    "this is reminiscent of claims of unusual abundances in bal qsos , including an excess of aluminum ( , turnshek  1996 ; junkkarinen  1997 ; shields 1997 ) .",
    "the reality of these abundance anomalies is in doubt , because of the effects of partial covering of the continuum source ( arav 1997 ) .",
    "however , the basic observation of anomalously strong al lines may be a possible parallel between pg 1222 + 228 and the bal qsos , where outflowing gas is clearly present . if this is a hint that the narrow , z = 1.94 system may be intrinsic , perhaps it adds plausibility to the idea that the z = 1.486 system ( or its neighbors ) may also be intrinsic .",
    "what might be the geometry of an intrinsic lls in pg 1222 + 228 ? in order to explain the polarization rise , the absorber would have to intercept the line of sight to the continuum source but not the scattering source .",
    "the latter is often attributed to a wind driven off the inner edge of a `` dust torus '' ( krolik & begelman 1986 ) .",
    "the location of this may be related to the dust sublimation radius , @xmath52 pc , where @xmath53 is the bolometric luminosity of the central source in units @xmath54 ( laor & draine 1993 ) .",
    "the absorbing material , at a velocity of @xmath55 would be at a smaller radius in order not to cover the scattering source .",
    "its high velocity suggests an origin at a small radius where the escape velocity is of order the observed outflow velocity .",
    "the escape velocity from a central mass of @xmath56 is 0.2@xmath57 at a radius @xmath58  cm , where @xmath59 .",
    "let us assume the absorbing material is at a radius of @xmath60  cm , large enough to obscure the ultraviolet emitting part of an accretion disk but not the scattering source .",
    "at the observed speed , the crossing time would be a few years or less .",
    "thus , the material should change radius substantially in the seven years between the sargent  ( 1988 ) and the impey  ( 1996 ) observations , and one might expect some change of velocity .",
    "these authors , however , quote velocities for the @xmath61 and 1.524 systems that agree within @xmath62 .",
    "this corresponds to a change in outflow velocity of less than @xmath63 .",
    "such precise stability seems difficult to achieve .",
    "( note , however , the stability of narrow features within the bal profiles of some qsos [ , weymann 1997 ] ) .",
    "a further problem involves the narrowness of the absorption lines .",
    "the radius of the ultraviolet emitting part of the disk would be at least @xmath64 gravitational radii , or about @xmath65  cm .",
    "if the absorber is at a radius @xmath66 cm , then the line of sight through the absorber to different parts of the continuum source would likely give noticeably different projected flow velocities .",
    "the observed linewidths ( see below ) are @xmath67 , less than one thousandth of the outflow velocity .",
    "these difficulties with the intrinsic absorber model for pg 1222 + 228 encourage us to examine the straightforward idea of an intervening lls .",
    "impey  ( 1995 , 1996 ) attributed the flux drop at observed wavelength @xmath16 to a lls associated with the @xmath68 absorption line system .",
    "they identify absorption lines of h i , c iii , n i , n ii , si ii , and si iii .",
    "they also identify systems at 1.5238 , 1.5272 , and 1.5650 , which have multiple lyman lines and , for @xmath69 , c iii .",
    "sargent , steidel , & boksenberg ( 1988 ) measure c iv @xmath70 , 1551 in the 1.486 and 1.524 systems with equivalent widths @xmath71   .",
    "however , steidel & sargent ( 1992 ) give a spectrum showing no detectable mg ii absorption .",
    "simple estimates suggested that the @xmath16 flux drop might be too gradual to be attributed to the converging lyman lines of the @xmath61 system .",
    "therefore , we computed a model spectrum involving an assumed power - law continuum and absorption by the hydrogen lines and bound - free continuum .",
    "the column density of h i was parameterized by the lyman edge optical depth , @xmath72 , and the lines were assumed to have a gaussian profile with a doppler parameter set to a typical value @xmath73 ( a larger line width would give an excessive equivalent width for  for the required .",
    "the observed decrement of the lyman line equivalent widths actually suggests a narrower core line width , with some of the  equivalent width being attributable to a broader component of modest column density .",
    "these details do not affect our conclusions . )",
    "inclusion of 50 lyman lines proved more than adequate to trace the convergence to the continuum optical depth .",
    "the model spectrum was convolved with a single component gaussian instrumental line profile following the discussion of impey  ( 1996 ) , using a fwhm of 2.9    for g190h and 4.2    for g270h .",
    "if only the @xmath61 system contributes to the lls , then the lyman line convergence is too close to the lyman limit ( @xmath1 ) to fit the observed feature .",
    "however , allocation of some h i column density to both the 1.486 and 1.524 systems gave a good fit .",
    "two additional lls appear to be associated with the @xmath74 and 1.174 systems .",
    "figure 3 shows the resulting model spectrum , along with the observed flux , binned in intervals of @xmath75   .",
    "the model has @xmath76 for z = ( 1.174 , 1.486 , 1.524 , 1.938 ) , respectively .",
    "( the value of for z = 1.174 is uncertain because of the poorly determined amount of scattered light below 2000  . )",
    "the three distinguishable lls show good agreement with the expected @xmath77 behavior of the lyman continuum optical depth above threshold , for an intrinsic continuum slope in the range @xmath78 to -2.0 .",
    "this is consistent with the slope -1.8 found by zheng  ( 1997 ) for their composite qso spectrum in the wavlength range @xmath79 to @xmath80 .",
    "a value @xmath81 is assumed in the fit shown in figure 3 .",
    "the gradual descent of the observed flux toward the lyman limit for the @xmath74 system is a puzzle , but it may involve the effects of unrelated absorption lines . an understanding of this is important , as it would play a role in the classification of pg 1222 + 228 as a candidate lyman edge qso .",
    "observations at higher spectral resolution would help to clarify the situation .",
    "sargent , steidel , and boksenberg ( 1989 ) discuss the statistics of lls in qsos .",
    "for the redshift range in question , they give a mean incidence of lls of @xmath82 per unit redshift .",
    "their data show many qsos with multiple lls , although the number of lls in pg 1222 + 228 may be somewhat higher than typical .",
    "however , the efforts to measure lyman continuum polarization in qsos to some extent targeted the candidate lyman edge qsos , and objects with lls of moderate optical depth may have an enhanced probability to be included .",
    "we conclude that an intrinsic power - law continuum , together with cosmologically intervening lyman limit absorption , provides a straightforward explanation of the ultraviolet spectrum of pg 1222 + 228 .",
    "the various lls in pg 1222 + 228 substantially attentuate the observed continuum . what is the behavior of the _ polarized flux _ when corrected for the absorption ? in view of the uncertainties in the measured polarization , a sufficient procedure is to estimate the polarized flux by multiplying the measured polarization in the chosen wavelength bins by the assumed intrinsic continuum flux . for this , we use the same wavelength bins described earlier , and the @xmath83 power - law continuum used in our fit .",
    "the resulting rotated stokes flux , @xmath84 , is shown in figure 4 .",
    "we see that the stokes flux now rises strongly with decreasing wavelength in the region of the polarization rise .",
    "this resembles the result found for pg 1630 + 377 by koratkar ( 1995 ) .",
    "a rising polarized flux is an important constraint on models for the origin of the polarization rise .",
    "swh showed that the wavelength dependence of the flux and polarization in pg 1222 + 228 and pg 1630 + 377 could be fit with an ad hoc model involving an accretion disk .",
    "the disk radiates as a black body , but the brightness temperature is depressed below the effective temperature for wavelengths below the lyman limit , simulating a lyman edge in the disk atmosphere .",
    "the polarization is assumed to rise abruptly at @xmath1 by an arbitrary amount .",
    "relativistic effects give a blueshifted , but still fairly abrupt polarization rise in the observed spectrum .",
    "the models are characterized by @xmath85 the dimensionless angular momentum of the hole ; the black hole mass ; the accretion rate , @xmath86 ; and the viewing angle , @xmath87 .",
    "swh found that @xmath88 gave approximately the observed wavelength for the polarization rise , for a relatively edge - on viewing angle .",
    "their fits to both objects had a fairly low value of @xmath89 , the maximum disk effective temperature , as required by the dropping flux in the lyman continuum region .",
    "the correction for lls absorption in pg 1222 + 228 hardens the far ultraviolet spectrum , and a higher value of @xmath89 is required to fit the energy distribution .",
    "figure 5 shows the continuum flux and polarization for a model with @xmath90 @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "( we have assumed = 70 and = 0.5 . )",
    "the model agrees reasonably well with the corrected flux in the lyman continuum and with the longer wavelength measurements .",
    "although the corrected flux was assumed to be a power law , a disk continuum would also likely fit the observed flux , given some freedom to adjust the lls optical depths .",
    "this model has a step - function rise in polarization from negligle polarization at wavelengths longward of @xmath1 to an ad hoc value of 2.1 times the chandrasekhar ( 1960 ) value for a pure scattering atmosphere .",
    "the model predicts an observed polarization and polarized flux that rise at a wavelength substantially blueshifted from @xmath1 , but the rise is more gradual than observed .",
    "this underscores the need for improved polarization measurements of this object .",
    "if the relativistic transfer function gives too gradual a polarization rise , even for an instantaneous polarization rise in the rest frame of the orbiting gas , then accretion disk models for the polarization rise will face a serious problem .",
    "the adopted model parameters give a bolometric luminosity @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the eddington limit .",
    "such a high value of @xmath95 is barely consistent with a geometrically thin disk . a larger value of @xmath96 would allow a larger mass for the required @xmath89 , but then the polarization rise would occur at a wavelength shorter than observed (  swh ) .",
    "evidently , an accretion disk fit to the corrected continuum of pg 1222 + 228 , in the manner of swh , pushes the disk parameters to the limits .",
    "conceivably , the thickening of the disk corresponding to the large value of @xmath95 may be related to the origin of the polarization rise .",
    "the lyman continuum polarization rises are among the more puzzling recent observational discoveries concerning qsos .",
    "the wavelength dependence , rising rather abruptly at nearly the same rest wavelength in the several known cases , suggests a connection with the bound levels of atoms .",
    "the proximity of the feature to @xmath1 further suggests an association with the lyman edge of hydrogen .",
    "the ad hoc model of swh supports an association with the lyman edge and raises the possiblity of confirming the presence of a relativistic disk and constraining its parameters .",
    "however , attempts to fit the feature with a physical model have encountered difficulties .",
    "this is an important problem for qso theory .",
    "are the reported polarization rises real ?",
    "the coincidence of the polarization rise in pg 1222 + 228 with a sharp drop in flux might raise the question of background problems with the fos spectropolarimeter .",
    "impey ( 1995 ) argue that the polarization is unlikely to be less than 2.7% around 2000   under any reasonable assumption for the fos background .",
    "however , the degree of polarization in the far ultraviolet is uncertain by at least a factor two because of systematic errors involving background and scattered light in the fos .",
    "the observed polarization rises in several qsos occur at different observed wavelengths but similar rest wavelengths .",
    "we are not aware of any polarization rises of this nature in fos spectropolarimetry of bl lac objects or stars .",
    "there is an urgent need for a renewed capability for ultraviolet spectropolarimetry from space to confirm and extend the measurements .",
    "lyman continuum polarization rises have heretofore been associated with the candidate lyman edge qsos ( see discussion by koratkar  1998 ) .",
    "our results suggest that pg 1222 + 228 may not be a true member of this class .",
    "measurements of the lyman continuum polarization in additional qsos are needed to clarify the frequency of occurence of the phenomenon and to look for correlations with features in the continuum flux , in the line intensities and polarization , and other properties .",
    "observations to shorter rest wavelengths are needed to determine whether the polarization falls or continues to rise .",
    "measurements of the time dependence of the polarization rises would be most interesting",
    ". the emitting radius of an accretion disk would be light weeks .",
    "lee and blandford ( 1995 ) considered a model for the far ultraviolet polarization rise of qsos that did not involve the lyman edge . noting that a number of resonance lines of heavy elements fall in the rest wavelength range where the polarization rises , they suggested that resonance scattering of the qso continuum might produce the observed polarization .",
    "such a model could produce a rising polarized flux , since the polarization could be essentially zero at wavelengths without scattering contributions .",
    "as noted above , the polarization rise in pg 1222 + 228 may be too steep for models involving an accretion disk . in this case",
    ", alternative models such as resonance scattering may hold promise .",
    "we note that the polarized flux spectrum of pg 1630 + 377 ( koratkar  1995 ) shows a strong rise at the wavelength of the n v emission line .    the claim by richards  ( 1999 ) that luminous qsos have many intrinsic , narrow , high velocity c iv absorption systems has important implications .",
    "this would complicate the use of such systems to probe the evolution of galaxies and the intergalactic medium .",
    "the mechanism for producing the absorbing clouds would add another challenge to the subject of outflows from qsos .",
    "surveys of qsos at different luminosities , to a uniform standard of signal - to - noise ratio , would allow confirmation of the claimed higher incidence of absorption in more luminous qsos .",
    "tests of the intrinsic nature of narrow absorptions have been summarized by barlow , hamann , & sargent ( 1997 ) .",
    "these include time variability of the depth and profile of the lines and evidence for saturated but nonblack line profiles .",
    "detection of changes in the velocities of the lines would be most revealing .",
    "chemical abundances may be an indicator , given evidence for high abundances in the broad absorption and emission - line regions of qsos ( , hamann & ferland 1993 ) .",
    "if c iv systems in high and low luminosity qsos have similar , mostly subsolar abundances , this might argue for their intervening nature .",

    "<S> we examine and reject interpretations of this feature involving a high velocity outflow . </S>",
    "<S> the observations agree with a model involving several intervening lyman limit systems , two of which happen to coincide with the lyman continuum polarization rise . </S>",
    "<S> after correction for the lyman limit absorption , the continuum shortward of @xmath1 is consistent with a typical power - law slope , @xmath2 this violates the apparent pattern for the lyman limit polarization rises to occur only in `` candidate lyman edge qsos '' . </S>",
    "<S> the corrected , polarized flux rises strongly at the wavelength of the polarization rise , resembling the case of pg 1630 + 377 . </S>",
    "<S> the rise in polarized flux places especially stringent requirements on models . </S>"
