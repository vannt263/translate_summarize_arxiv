    "the last decade has seen a crystallisation of ideas regarding the nature of the dressed - gluon and -quark propagators in qcd . in landau gauge the dressed gluon two - point function",
    "is widely held to be described by a momentum - dependent mass function , @xmath0 .",
    "its magnitude is large at infrared momenta : @xmath1 .",
    "however , it vanishes with increasing spacelike momenta : @xmath2 , thereby maintaining full accord with perturbative qcd .",
    "background and context for these observations may be found , e.g. , in refs.@xcite , and citations therein and thereto .",
    "similarly , the dressed quark two - point function is described by two momentum - dependent functions : a wave - function renormalisation , @xmath3 , and mass function , @xmath4 , both of which are strongly modified from their perturbative forms for @xmath5 . in fact , from the confluence of results on @xmath4 obtained with dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) in qcd and numerical simulations of the lattice - regularised theory , evident , e.g. , in refs.@xcite , a widespread appreciation has emerged of the reality and impact of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) in the strong interaction .",
    "since the two - point functions of elementary excitations are strongly modified in the infrared , one must accept that the same is generally true for three - point functions ; i.e. , the vertices .",
    "this was actually realised early on , with studies of the fermion  gauge - boson vertex in abelian gauge theories @xcite that have inspired numerous ensuing analyses .",
    "the importance of this dressing to the reliable computation of hadron physics observables was exposed in refs.@xcite , insights from which have subsequently been exploited effectively ; e.g. , refs.@xcite .",
    "many studies of hadron physics observables have employed an _",
    "ansatz _ for the fermion ",
    "photon vertex .",
    "the best are informed by analyses that emphasise the constraints of quantum field theory , amongst which are that the vertex should @xcite : be free of kinematic singularities ; ensure gauge covariance and invariance ; and assist in providing for the multiplicative renormalisability of solutions to the dses within which it appears .",
    "_ anstze _ that are largely consistent with these constraints have also been used to represent the dressed quark - gluon vertex . in this connection ,",
    "perhaps , it is clearest that such considerations are not sufficient to fully determine the vertex . as an example , the ball - chiu vertex @xcite augmented by the curtis - pennington extension @xcite is unable to explain the mass splitting between the @xmath6- and @xmath7-mesons , parity partners in the spectrum .",
    "the minimum required to understand this is inclusion of a dressed - quark anomalous chromomagnetic moment @xcite , the presence and strength of which are driven by dcsb @xcite and confirmed by numerical simulations of lattice - qcd @xcite .",
    "we note that extending lattice analyses to the entire kinematic domain of spacelike momenta relevant to the numerous uses of the fermion  gauge - boson vertex is numerically challenging @xcite .",
    "we suspect that absent an appreciation within the lattice - qcd community of the physical importance of this problem , much time will elapse before new results are available .",
    "this magnifies the importance of studies in the continuum .",
    "it is in this context that we are motivated to readdress the task of constructing an efficacious and workable vertex _",
    "ansatz_. owing to sensible considerations regarding tractability , the most recent detailed studies @xcite have deliberately overlooked the role of dcsb in building the fermion  gauge - boson vertex .",
    "herein , informed by recent developments in hadron physics phenomenology @xcite , notably the dynamical generation of an anomalous magnetic moment for perturbatively massless fermions , we develop a practical _ ansatz _ for the fermion - photon vertex that produces a gauge - independent critical coupling for dcsb in qed and shows some promise as a tool for hadron physics phenomenology .",
    "section  [ sec : gapqed ] provides some background on the coupling of a dressed - fermion to a photon .",
    "our _ ansatz _ is developed in sec.[sec : ansatz ] and employed to find a critical coupling for dcsb in sec.[sec : alphac ] .",
    "section  [ sec : sandw ] illustrates a phenomenological utility of the model and explains some obvious weaknesses , and sec.[sec : epilogue ] is an epilogue .",
    "much of the progress toward understanding dcsb and the fermion  gauge - boson vertex has followed from studies of the gap equation , which in qed can be written @xmath8 where : we employ a poincar invariant regularisation of the integral , with @xmath9 the regularisation mass - scale , which typically doubles as the renormalisation point in dse studies of qed ; @xmath10 is the fermion wave - function renormalisation ( @xmath11 in qed ) ; @xmath12 is the fine - structure constant ; and the dressed - photon propagator is @xmath13\\frac{1}{q^2[1+\\pi(q^2 ) ] } + \\xi \\frac{q_\\mu q_\\nu}{q^4}\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath14 the covariant - gauge parameter . whilst our vertex _",
    "ansatz _ is always consistent with one - loop qed perturbation theory , aspects of the infrared behaviour we elucidate are particular to the quenched theory ; viz .",

    "we use a euclidean metric : @xmath16 ; @xmath17 ; @xmath18 $ ] ; @xmath19 ; and @xmath20 spacelike @xmath21 @xmath22 .",
    "the solution of eq . has the form @xmath23 in order to study dcsb , one must define a chiral limit and explore the behaviour of @xmath4 as the value of the fine - structure constant is varied .",
    "this is straightforward if the fine - structure constant is less than some critical value , denoted by @xmath24 , for then @xmath25 defines the chiral limit and @xmath26 is the only solution for the mass function .",
    "it might , however , be viewed as problematic for @xmath27 because four - fermion operators become relevant in strong - coupling qed and must be included in order to obtain a well - defined continuum limit @xcite .",
    "this complication is not of concern to us because one can obtain the critical coupling by approaching this value from below and at strong coupling one can view the cutoff version of the theory as an illustrative model .",
    "owing to the ward - takahashi identity : @xmath28 ( or the slavnov - taylor identity in non - abelian theories ) , eleven independent tensor structures are required to fully express a fermion  gauge - boson vertex .",
    "furthermore , @xmath29 can always be decomposed into two pieces : @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xcite @xmath32 , \\label{bcvtx}\\\\ & : = & \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\lambda_i(k^2,p^2 ) \\ , i l^i_\\mu(k , p ) \\ , , \\label{bcvtx2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for an abelian theory , where @xmath33 ,    @xmath34\\ , , \\\\",

    "we now address aspects of an additional issue ; namely , whether the _ ansatz _ expressed in eqs. , is adequate for use in nonperturbative studies of truncated dses or to describe the dressed - quark  photon coupling in hadron physics phenomenology .",

    "we limit ourselves to the context provided by the anomalous magnetic moment of a dressed fermion , in part because above we have highlighted dcsb and this emergent phenomenon produces an anomalous magnetic moment for a perturbatively massless fermion : it is impossible for a truly massless fermion to possess a measurable anomalous magnetic moment @xcite .",

    ", there are some caveats that should be borne in mind . as observed in sec.[subsec : oneloop ] , no _ ansatz _ for the transverse part of the fermion - photon vertex is completely satisfactory if it does not express what might be called leakage into the spacelike region of spectral strength from both the two - pion continuum and the region of the @xmath6-meson pole .",
    "if one concentrates on the spacelike domain , then such effects are maximal near @xmath72 and may be characterised by observing that they alter charge radii by @xmath145% @xcite . related , and more important perhaps , are the limitations of the tensor basis in eqs . that we discussed in sec.[subsec : amm ] .",
    "namely , analyses concerned with domains of ultraviolet momenta are not necessarily a fair guide to the @xmath85-dependence of the vertex in the infrared .",
    "explicit computations @xcite present conflicts with expectations fed by _ anstze",

    ", . finally , it is worth investigating how our _ ansatz _ fares in the dse for the photon vacuum polarisation , which is known to be sensitive to features and kinematic domains that are not strongly constrained by the gap equation @xcite .",
    "such analyses would likely lead to a refinement of our model .",
    "motivated by the fact that knowledge of the dressed - fermion  gauge - boson vertex is critical to any continuum study of a gauge field theory , we have detailed a workable model for the dressed - fermion - photon vertex , @xmath29 .",
    "it is expressed solely in terms of functions which appear in the dressed - fermion propagator , is independent of the angle defined by @xmath127 , and does not explicitly depend on the covariant - gauge parameter .",

    "significantly , the _ ansatz _ contains nontrivial factors associated with those tensors that are even in the number of dirac matrices ; i.e. , whose appearance is expressly driven by dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in a perturbatively massless theory .",
    "this novel feature enables a direct and positive comparison with the best available symmetry - preserving solutions of the inhomogeneous bethe - salpeter equation for the vector vertex .",
    "the positive outcome indicates that our model might provide a much needed tool for use in poincar - covariant symmetry - preserving studies of hadron electromagnetic form factors .",
    "furthermore , given the general nature of our constraints and the simplicity of our construction , there is some room to hope that a straightforward extension of our approach might yield an _ ansatz _ adequate to the task of representing the dressed - quark - gluon vertex .",

    "<S> we present a workable model for the fermion - photon vertex , which is expressed solely in terms of functions that appear in the fermion propagator and independent of the angle between the relative momenta , and does not explicitly depend on the covariant - gauge parameter . </S>",
    "<S> it nevertheless produces a critical coupling for dynamical chiral symmetry breaking that is practically independent of the covariant - gauge parameter and an anomalous magnetic moment distribution for the dressed fermion that agrees in important respects with realistic numerical solutions of the inhomogeneous vector bethe - salpeter equation . </S>"
