    "the impossiblity of reproducing the effect of quantum correlations between the outcomes of the distant measurements using local hidden variable theories is known as quantum non - locality . in 1964 , bell constructed an inequality which is satisfied in the absence of non - local correlations between the results of distant measurements @xcite .",
    "experimental violation of bell s inequality confirm the existence of the non - local correlation between the outcome of the measurements .",
    "the most well - known form of the bell inequality is given by clauser , horne , shimony , and holt ( chsh ) and it is known as bell - chsh inequality @xcite .",
    "the bell - chsh operator for two qubits is given by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 are unit vectors in @xmath5 .",
    "the bell - chsh inequality is then given by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 denotes any two qubit pure or mixed state .",
    "this inequality is violated by any two qubit pure entangled state , but on the contrary not all two qubit mixed entangled states violate the bell - chsh inequality .",
    "foundational interest in nonlocality is bolstered through its connection with information theoretic tasks such as teleportation @xcite .",
    "quantum nonlocality finds applications in several information theoretic protocols such as device independent quantum key generation @xcite , quantum state estimation @xcite , and communication complexity @xcite , where the amount of violation of the bell - chsh inequality is important . in order to obtain the maximal violation of the bell - chsh inequality",
    ", one has to calculate the expectation of the bell - chsh operator by maximizing over all measurements of spin in the directions @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , the problem of maximal violation of the bell - chsh inequality reduces to an optimization problem .",
    "the optimization problem for the two qubit system was analytically solved by horodecki @xcite by expressing the value of @xmath8 in terms of the eigenvalues of the symmetric matrix @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the correlation matrix of the state @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , the maximal violation of the bell - chsh inequality depends on the eigenvalues of the symmetric matrix @xmath9 .    like two qubit non - locality , non - locality for three qubit systems has also been studied using various approaches .",
    "a generalized form of the bell - chsh inequality was obtained for three qubits called mermin s inequality @xcite which can be violated by not only genuine entangled three qubit states but also by biseparable states . on the other hand ,",
    "all genuine entangled three qubit states violate the svetlichny inequality @xcite",
    ". there has been quite a bit of recent interest in studying the nonlocality of tripartite systems .",
    "a notable direction in this context is the so - called ` superactivation of nonlocality ' @xcite which has been investigated also for the case of three qubits @xcite .",
    "the relation of nonlocality with quantum uncertainty has been exhibited for tripartite systems using fine - graining @xcite , in the context of biased @xcite and unbiased qauntum games .",
    "the security of quantum cryptography is connected with quantum nonlocality @xcite , that is especially relevant in the context of device independent quantum key distribution .",
    "violation of the mermin inequality has been computed for several three qubit states such as ghz and w - states earlier @xcite . in order to find the maximum violation of the mermin inequality for three qubit states one has to tackle the optimization problem numerically because there does not exist any analytical formula for even pure three qubit states .",
    "motivated by the work of horodecki @xcite in the context of two qubit systems , in the present work we perform the optimization problem involved in the mermin inequality analytically and obtain a formula for the maximal value of the expectation of the mermin operator in terms of the eigenvalues of symmetric matrices , that gives the maximal violation of the mermin inequality not only for pure states but also for mixed states .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section - ii",
    ", we solve the optimization problem analytically and obtain the maximum value of the expectation of the mermin operator in terms of eigenvalues .",
    "in section - iii , we provide a few examples where the magnitude of the mermin operator is calculated using our derived formular for pure and mixed states . certain concluding remarks are presented in section - iv .",
