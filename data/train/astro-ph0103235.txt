    "the short - duration , hard - spectrum gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) in the batse catalog , often called class ii bursts , have no detected afterglows . as a consequence ,",
    "they have not yet been subject to scrutiny for absorption lines , and the distance from earth at which these bursts originate is uncertain . here",
    "we will explore the possibility of a relatively nearby extragalactic origin , @xmath9 , for ( at least ) some class ii grbs .",
    "kouveliotou et al .  first showed that the grb population is bimodal @xcite .",
    "more recently , murkherjee et al . found evidence that there exist _ three _ classes of batse grbs @xcite .",
    "but hakkilla et al .",
    "@xcite ) argued that class iii properties can be produced from class i by a combination of measurement error , hardness - intensity correlation , and a newly - identified batse bias , the fluence duration bias .",
    "class ii grbs , which are short - duration , low - fluence , hard - spectrum events , do not seem to be related to class i / iii .",
    "it is class ii grbs , or some subset of class ii , that we suggest are mfs .",
    "class ii grbs have many features in common with the hard spikes of mfs .  about @xmath10 of class ii bursts are single - peaked @xcite .",
    "most peaks exhibit a fast rise and slower decline , with hard - to - soft spectral evolution @xcite .",
    "these properties are shared by the hard spikes of the march 5th and august 27th events @xcite , which also had similar spectral hardness @xcite .",
    "class ii grbs that are sufficiently bright to study with fine time resolution often show substructure down to time scales of @xmath11 ms and less @xcite , as did the 1979 march 5 event @xcite .",
    "consider a beamed source of gamma - rays , emitting uniformly into a beaming fraction @xmath12 of the unit sphere , with peak beam luminosity @xmath13 . for a batse",
    "peak - flux detection threshold @xmath14 , the sampling depth of batse is @xmath15 if @xmath16 is small enough that source density evolution and departures from euclidean geometry are negligible , then batse s rate of event detection is @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the density of @xmath19 galaxies ( with luminosities comparable to that of the milky way ) and @xmath20 is the rate of mfs within each @xmath19 galaxy .",

    "@xcite ) and @xmath25 mpc@xmath26 from the local normalization of the schechter luminosity function ( e.g. , ref .",
    "we will adopt a hubble constant of @xmath27 km s@xmath24 mpc@xmath24 , thus @xmath28    given 2 mfs in our galaxy ( or in nearby dwarf satellite galaxies ) in the past @xmath29 years of effective full sky coverage during which have had capability for detecting them ( hurley 1999 , private communication ) , the mf rate per @xmath19 galaxy is roughly @xmath30    the simplest idealization is that the gamma - rays in mf hard spikes are emitted isotropically , @xmath31 . since the long , soft , oscillating tails of mfs have never been observed without hard spikes at their onsets , we infer that many or most mfs begin with a spike of quasi - isotropic emissions .",

    "this falls just short of the virgo cluster at @xmath35 \\approx 18 \\ ,   h_{65}^{-1}$ ]",
    "the full - sky batse detection rate is @xmath36 since batse operated for 9.5 years , corresponding to 4.75 yrs of full - sky coverage , there should be @xmath37 extragalactic mfs in the batse catalog , detected via their quasi - isotropic hard spike emissions .",
    "the most uncertain parameter in this estimate is @xmath20 , the galactic rate of mfs .",
    "the bayesian probability distribution for @xmath20 , @xmath38 , is @xmath39 where the probability for observing 2 mfs in time @xmath40 yr , given @xmath20 , is @xmath41 since this is a poisson process .",
    "the appropriate prior distribution , when we do nt know the order of magnitude of @xmath20 _ a priori _ , is @xmath42 , or @xmath43 .",
    "thus @xmath44 with a mean value @xmath45 yr@xmath24 as noted above [ eq .  ( [ gamma ] ) ] .",
    "the probability for the galactic flare rate to exceed a cutoff value , @xmath46 , is thus .",
    "if other sources of uncertainty can be neglected , then there is a @xmath47 probability for at least one isotropic mf in the batse catalog , @xmath48 .",
    "the probability is @xmath49 for @xmath50 ; @xmath51 for @xmath52 ; @xmath53 for @xmath54 ; and @xmath55 for @xmath56 .",

    "( [ batdepth])([batrate ] ) , the batse sampling depth for beamed mfs is @xmath62 and the ( full - sky ) rate of detection is @xmath63    this is plausibly in agreement with the rate of detection of class ii bursts by batse . out of 796 bursts classified by murkherjee et al . , about 185 were class ii , or @xmath64 .",
    "since batse detects about 300 grb per year with half - sky coverage ( due to the fact that the _ compton observatory _ is in low earth orbit ) , the full - sky detection rate of class ii bursts is roughly   @xmath65    however , there is no compelling reason to expect such a beamed emission component based upon the magnetar model@xcite .",
    "moreover , the number - intensity or @xmath66 distribution of class ii grbs seems to give evidence against a local extragalactic origin for these events .",
    "this is a serious concern ; however , note that the evidence for @xmath67 in class ii bursts is much less compelling than in class i / iii .",
    "it is possible that selection effects cause a paucity of batse events just above threshold for peak flux on 256 and 64-ms time scales .",
    "( flux averaged over 1.024 s does not give a good brightness measure for these short bursts . )",
    "faint and poorly - measured bursts are systematically removed because of insufficient information to make class identifications ( e.g. , only 778 out of 1122 catalogued bursts were classified in ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; and the class identifications themselves are least reliable near threshold where measurements are most statistically dubious .",
    "it is also possible that the _ bright _ class ii bursts include a contamination of physically - distinct , non - euclidean ( low @xmath68 ) events ; e.g. , a tail of class i bursts extending to short durations , or a subclass of short bursts from galactic sgrs or axps like the bright , hard - spectrum events with @xmath69 s already identified from sgr 1900 + 14 @xcite . note that tavani @xcite found for short duration , soft spectrum bursts in the batse catalog ( 66 events with @xmath70 s and @xmath71 ) , and cline , matthey & otwinowski @xcite found for all batse bursts with @xmath72 s.",
    "under the idealization that mf hard spikes are emitted quasi - isotropically , we find that the batse catalog contains @xmath3 extragalactic mfs [ eq .",
    "( [ niso ] ) ] .",
    "these events are expected to be fast - rising ( @xmath73 ms ) , short - duration bursts , correlated in position with galaxies at @xmath74 mpc .",
    "insofar as the quasi - isotropic component of mf hard spikes have uniform peak luminosities , there will be a diminishment of the peak flux with @xmath75 according to @xmath76 , affording a possible auxiliary check on associations . as a group , these",
    " isotropic mfs \" should tend to concentrate toward the supergalactic plane @xcite .",
    "hartmann , briggs & mannheim ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) found no significant supergalactic anisotropy in the batse catalog , but their statistics were dominated by class i bursts . at distances less than @xmath77 the distribution of candidate mfs may show a significant virgocentric dipole moment ( e.g. , fig .",
    "3.3 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; and a correlation with virgo s discrete position on the sky if the sampling depth ( eq .  [ [ diso ] ] ) extends as far as @xmath78 .",
    "this prediction of  isotropic mfs \" in the batse catalog is based upon direct , reliable extrapolation from observations of the 1979 march 5 and 1998 august 27 events .",
    "more speculatively , in any model of mfs , a full - sky batse rate @xmath79 is possible if there exists a _ beamed emission component _ with full opening angle @xmath80 where @xmath13 is the total beam peak power .",
    "this equation assumes two polar beams ; for a single beam , @xmath57 goes up by @xmath81 .",
    "if such beamed mfs accounted for many or all class ii grbs , then the events would have positions correlated with galaxies and galaxy clusters within the batse sampling depth at redshift @xmath82 several studies have found correlations of grb positions with galaxy clusters in the abell , corwin & olowin ( hereafter aco ) catalog @xcite , but only at a statistically marginal level @xcite .",
    "these studies have focused primarily on bursts with small positional error boxes , which are mostly bright class i events .",
    "note that the mfs come from young neutron stars in star - forming regions .",
    "such sources are not expected to concentrate strongly within rich galaxy clusters , which contain mostly early - type ( gas - stripped ) galaxies .",
    "the positional correlations expected for mfs are difficult to study using batse data .",
    "class ii grbs , with short durations and relatively low fluences , tend to have poorly - determined positions , often with batse error boxes of size @xmath83 .",
    "future experiments will localize short - duration grbs well enough to test for correlations with nearby galaxies and galaxy clusters , hopefully making the identification of extragalactic mfs possible ."
