    "layered transition metal oxides present a paradigm for strongly correlated electronic systems subject to interesting correlated states and the competition of multiple order parameters .",
    "the high temperature oxide superconductors are a much - studied case in point .",

    "here we consider layered tungstates as another new model system capable of displaying a complex phase behaviour dependent upon interlayer coupling and doping state .",
    "tungsten oxide has been the subject of much research in the past few decades due to its interesting physical and electronic properties and doping capability .",
    "tungsten trioxide can form a variety of stable structures at room temperature , such as pyrochlore , hexagonal , or distorted cubic @xcite , all of which are comprised of corner- and/or edge - shared wo@xmath5 octahedra .",
    "these structures can be doped by inserting mono- or di - valent atomic species into the interstitial vacancy sites within the oxide structure @xcite , or by removing oxygen @xcite .",
    "this results in an increase in electrical conductivity @xcite and dramatic colour changes @xcite , which has led to tungsten trioxide systems being used in electrochromic applications @xcite .",
    "tungsten trioxide can be hydrated to form layered structures , with a general formula of wo@xmath1@xmath6@xmath7h@xmath3o . in the mono - hydrate , wo@xmath1@xmath6h@xmath3o ( or h@xmath3wo@xmath4 )",
    ", two - dimensional layers of corner - shared wo@xmath5 octahedra are formed , with a water molecule ( @xmath0oh@xmath3 ) substituted for one apical oxygen of the tungsten atom , and a terminal oxygen completing the structure @xcite . in the di - hydrate ( wo@xmath1@xmath62h@xmath3o )",
    ", the second water molecule is inserted between the layers , as in moo@xmath1@xmath62h@xmath3o @xcite .",
    "an increase in the interlayer spacing is observed @xcite and it thus follows that one could perhaps substitute organic species between the tungsten oxide layers .",
    "indeed this has proven successful , with various groups succeeding in intercalating organic molecules such as pyrazine @xcite , 4,4-bipyridine @xcite , pyridine @xcite , tert - alkylammonium species @xcite , mono - aminoalkanes @xcite and diamino - alkanes @xcite .",
    "such materials provide an interesting template for doping and substitutional ( e.g. magnetic ions ) studies in low - dimensional systems .    here",
    "we present infrared and raman results on a selection of wo@xmath1-based hybrid materials in order to gain a more extensive understanding of the overall structure ; in particular , the bonding nature of the organic to the inorganic layer , and the impact of the organic intercalant on the structure of the inorganic layer .",
    "diaminoalkane - tungsten oxide samples were synthesised as described in ref . .",
    "in brief , h@xmath3wo@xmath4 was dissolved in hot aqueous ammonia solution ( 33 wt .",
    "@xmath8 ) and then a solution of the organic amines ( @xmath9,@xmath10-diamine , h@xmath3n(ch@xmath3)@xmath11nh@xmath3 , hereby abbreviated to dan ; or phenethylamine , c@xmath5h@xmath12(ch@xmath3)@xmath3nh@xmath3 , abbreviated to phen ) dissolved in ammonia was added in a 2:1 molar ratio .",
    "the excess solvent was then evaporated off and the hybrid materials were obtained as white / cream - coloured powders .",
    "the entire synthesis was carried out under flowing n@xmath3 gas .",
    "powder x - ray diffraction spectra were recorded using a philips pw1700 series powder diffractometer with co k@xmath9 radiation .",

    "raman spectra were collected using a jobin - yvon labram hr spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 633 nm .",
    "the x - ray diffraction spectra shown in figure  [ fig : xrd]a display a strong peak at low 2@xmath14 angles . as the length of the intercalated organic molecule is increased , the corresponding d - spacing also increases in a linear fashion ( shown in figure  [ fig : xrd]b ) . from the slope and intercept of this line we propose a model by which single molecular layers of 2-dimensional corner - shared wo@xmath5 octahedra are separated by the organic molecules which are aligned almost perpendicular to the tungsten oxide layers .",
    "one would expect such a layered compound to display properties approaching those of a purely 2-dimensional system as the distance between the oxide layers is increased ( by increasing the length of the organic spacer molecule ) .",
    "the physical properties of this system will be the topic of future publications .",

    "these peaks do not occur in the wo@xmath1 spectra , as expected .    as mentioned earlier , the structure of h@xmath3wo@xmath4 consists of layers of corner - shared wo@xmath5 octahedra with alternate apical arrangements of w@xmath0oh@xmath3 and w = o . in the raman spectrum",
    "the w = o bonding is shown clearly by a sharp band centred at about 950 @xmath13 .",
    "this is also present in the ir spectrum .",
    "surprisingly , the wo@xmath1 sample also exhibits a small peak at this position in the raman and ir spectra .",
    "this is not expected as the structure of wo@xmath1 consists only of single w@xmath0o bonds .",
    "however it can be explained by the presence of disorder in the sample and loss of oxygen @xcite powder is a pale yellow colour , which is reduced over 1 - 2 days in air to a pale green colour .",
    "this is indicative of a loss of oxygen but can be regained by storing in an oxygen atmosphere or heating in oxygen for a few hours . ] , which results in the formation of a small fraction of w = o bonds .",
    "there are also w = o terminations on the surfaces of the powder particles .    in the diaminoalkane hybrid compounds",
    "the characteristic w = o peak , formerly at 950 @xmath13 in h@xmath3wo@xmath4 , shifts to a lower frequency of 890 - 900 @xmath13 . while in several of these compounds there are peaks at 950 @xmath13 they are not as intense as the w = o peak .",
    "it is also of interest to note that the peak at 888 @xmath13 in the w - da2 raman spectrum is a doublet , suggesting perhaps the presence of two different w = o bonds . in w - phen , the peak structure in the range 900 - 100",
    "@xmath13 is quite different from the other hybrid spectra .",
    "this may be due to the organic molecule being mono - dentate ( as ir spectra of other mono - aminoalkane hybrids show that the 950 @xmath13 w = o peak is virtually unaltered @xcite ) or more complicated due to the presence of the aromatic ring . in any case , the sharp raman peak at 1004 @xmath13 is likely to be a w = o peak due to the similarity in shape between it and the known w = o peak in h@xmath3wo@xmath4 , for example",
    ". there may be more than one variation of the w = o bond within the structure , which may also account for the multiple peaks observed in this region , as is the case in wo@xmath1@xmath62h@xmath3o @xcite .",
    "there is a relationship between bond length ( an indication of bond strength ) and the frequency of the vibrational modes(s ) for the terminal w@xmath0o bond , namely that as the bond length decreases , bond strength and frequency increases @xcite .",
    "it is not therefore impossible to observe more than one terminal w@xmath0o vibration .",
    "the remaining bands can be assigned as follows : 580 - 860 @xmath13 o@xmath0w@xmath0o stretching , 430 - 470 @xmath13 inorganic raman mode ( w@xmath0o ) , 260 - 350 @xmath13 o@xmath0w@xmath0o bending , 220 - 250 @xmath13 w@xmath0o@xmath0w stretching , 90 - 200 @xmath13 lattice modes .",
    "these bands occur at similar positions in the hybrid compounds .",
    "perhaps the most telling difference between w - da2 and w - dan ( n@xmath152 ) is the presence or absence of the broad peak centred at  2100 @xmath13 in the ir spectra .",
    "this feature is due to a combination of the asymmetrical @xmath0nh@xmath1@xmath2 bending vibration and the torsional oscillation of the @xmath0nh@xmath1@xmath2 group @xcite .",
    "both @xmath0nh@xmath3 scissoring and @xmath0nh@xmath1@xmath2 bending occurs in the region 1580 - 1630 @xmath13 , however the latter displays three peaks ( as seen in w - dan ) while the former yields only two ( as in w - da2 ) .",
    "lastly , the n@xmath0h stretching bands occur at slightly higher energies in w - dan compared with w - da2 ( 3240 - 3300 @xmath13 , c.f . 3135 - 3250 @xmath13 ) and these peaks are also much sharper .",
    "however , an increase in alkyl chain length should have little effect on the n@xmath0h stretching frequency @xcite .",
    "the observed differences are discussed in section iii .",
    "the presence of broad vibrational bands in the w - dan spectra in the range 2430 - 2790 @xmath13 can be ascribed to nh@xmath1@xmath2 symmetrical stretching @xcite and often appear as a broad , ill - defined band under the c@xmath0h stretching modes near 2800 @xmath13 @xcite . in h@xmath3wo@xmath4",
    "a small peak is observed in the ir spectrum at 1614 @xmath13 , which corresponds to h@xmath3o bending .",
    "while the hybrid samples also exhibit peaks near this value ( 1600 - 1630 @xmath13 ) , these peaks are sharp and well defined , and the vibrational band at  3400 @xmath13 ( indicative of o@xmath0h stretching ) is absent .",
    "thus we conclude that most of the co - ordinated water molecules ( w@xmath0oh@xmath3 ) have been dehydrogenated during the organic intercalation process ( a small feature at 377 @xmath13 in the raman spectra may correspond to w@xmath0o@xmath0h ) .",
    "the peaks in the hybrid spectra in the range 1600 - 1630 @xmath13 correspond instead to nh@xmath3 or nh@xmath1@xmath2 bending .    as only the terminal amino / ammonium group",
    "is involved in interactions with the inorganic layer , it is no surprise that the bands corresponding to c@xmath0h , c@xmath0n and c@xmath0c vibrations remain virtually unchanged .",
    "the peaks in the hybrid spectra corresponding to these vibrations can be assigned as follows : 2850 - 2960 @xmath13 c@xmath0h stretching , 1300 - 1500 @xmath13 ch@xmath3 wagging , bending , and scissoring ; also c = c aromatic stretching for w - phen ( 1450 - 1500 @xmath13 ) , 950 - 1100 @xmath13 c@xmath0n and c@xmath0c stretching . from 460 - 550 @xmath13",
    "there are a small number of unassigned organic bands ( including a sharp peak in the ir at 537 @xmath13 for w - da2 , corresponding to the bending vibration of the nccn backbone @xcite ) .",
    "the most noticeable difference among the hybrid samples is that w - da2 shows quite a different bonding nature to the hybrids with longer organic chains : there is no evidence for the presence of ammonium ( @xmath0nh@xmath1@xmath2 ) terminal groups in w - da2 .",
    "as mentioned previously , w - da2 lacks a feature at 2100 @xmath13 found in the other hybrid spectra that corresponds to deformations of terminal @xmath0nh@xmath1@xmath2 .",
    "combined with the presence of the @xmath0nh@xmath1@xmath2 rocking mode found at  770 @xmath13 @xcite , this implies that some of the amine molecules in w - dan appear as r@xmath0nh@xmath1@xmath2@xmath16@xmath17o@xmath0w , while all those of w - da2 appear as neutral @xmath0nh@xmath3 species .",
    "this raises the question of how charge balance is achieved in w - da2 and also whether hydrogen bonding is the exclusive mechanism of bonding , whereas in the longer organic molecule hybrids there is clearly an electrostatic component as well due to the presence of terminal ammonium groups .",
    "there are also differences in the n@xmath0h stretch region , suggesting changes in the bonding chemistry as one progresses from da2 to longer dan alkyl chains .",
    "as mentioned in section ii , the n@xmath0h stretching bands for w - da2 appear at lower wavenumbers than for longer - chain w - dan species . hydrogen bonding ( which holds the da2 molecules in place between the layers ) will cause these bands to shift to lower frequencies @xcite .",
    "da2 is the only case where the inductive effect on the terminal amine groups is known to be a perturbing factor to the molecular vibrations due to the shorter alkyl chain length @xcite .",
    "plot of pk@xmath18 values from ref .",
    "versus the number of carbon atoms of @xmath9,@xmath10-diamines in aqueous solution.,width=321,height=226 ]    one possible explanation for the observed difference in structure between da2 and longer dan molecules intercalated into an acidic metal oxide , arises from examining the trend in basicity of @xmath9,@xmath10-diamines in solution .",
    "although the trend in basicity only changes slightly with increasing alkyl length for the monoamines ( due to combinations of solution effect , steric hindrance to solvation , and number of available h - bonds @xcite ) , a substantial increase in basicity is observed in going from da2 to da8 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pka ] ) .",
    "this increase in base strength for the diaminoalkanes is due to an increase of the inductive effect as the number of methylene groups ( @xmath0ch@xmath3@xmath0 ) increases .",
    "the formation of alkylammonium ( @xmath0nh@xmath1@xmath2 ) end groups will therefore be more favourable for the more basic diaminoalkanes ( i.e. diaminobutane and above ) .",
    "this apparent difference is also manifested in the tga profile of these hybrids , with w - da2 dissociating at a higher temperature than any of the other w - dan compounds @xcite .",
    "the strong raman peak at 950 @xmath13 in h@xmath3wo@xmath4 corresponds to an apical w = o bond , which is characteristic of a layered structure .",
    "this peak is present in all of the hybrid compounds although it is shifted to lower wavenumbers of 890 - 900 @xmath13 , indicating that the apical oxygen is not as tightly bound to the tungsten as in h@xmath3wo@xmath4 .",
    "this too can be expected as charge balance in h@xmath3wo@xmath4 is achieved by co - ordinated water molecules binding alternately upper and lower of the tungsten layer , leaving the remaining apical oxygen atoms to bind relatively strongly . in the hybrid materials one might expect the influence of organic molecules on each apical oxygen to be more uniform",
    ", hence this interaction will weaken the w = o bond , and this is indeed evident from the raman shift .",
    "there is evidence to suggest that in w - phen , a monodentate amine hybrid , there are several variations of the w = o bond , which in itself warrants further study .",
    "the structure and electronic density of states of these layered systems are currently being investigated by @xmath19 computations .",
    "the question of the relocation of protons in the w - da2 system is a particular issue of study .",
    "infrared and raman spectroscopy have been utilised to gain an understanding of the bonding nature between the organic and inorganic components of tungsten oxide - hybrid systems with different length diaminoalkanes and how the inclusion of organic molecules affects the structure of the inorganic layers .",
    "tungsten oxide - ethylenediamine displays a different bonding nature from the other hybrid materials in that it appears to rely on hydrogen - bonding only , with no terminal @xmath0nh@xmath1@xmath2 ammonium groups to form electrostatic bonds .",
    "this is thought to be related to the lower basicity of ethylenediamine as opposed to the longer diaminoalkane species .",
    "all of the tungsten oxide - organic hybrid materials exhibit a decrease in the strength of the apical w = o bond of the wo@xmath4@xmath20 layers compared with the layered tungsten oxide monohydrate ( tungstic acid ) , h@xmath3wo@xmath4 .",
