    "coherent states have become a tool of the utmost importance in quantum optics and many efforts have been devoted to investigate them , also with respect to their prospective applications in the growing field of quantum technologies ( qt ) such as quantum information ( coding , transmission and elaboration of information by exploiting properties of quantum states ) , quantum computing , quantum imaging and quantum metrology .",
    "in particular , their original definition has been generalized , so that nowadays several quantum optical extensions of the glauber states have been constructed and analyzed from both the theoretical @xcite-@xcite and the experimental @xcite-@xcite point of view .",
    "such states can find application also in quantum calculus , as shown , e.g. , in @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "the focus is on the @xmath0-boson and single - boson nonlinear coherent states ( nlcs ) which can be realized experimentally by means of trapped ions interacting with driving electromagnetic fields , as reported in references @xcite and @xcite , respectively . due to their mathematical structure",
    "these states are affected , for specific values of the lamb - dicke parameter , by singularity problems which do not appear to have been tackled systematically so far .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 the hamiltonian of a ion trap driven by two lasers is illustrated , while the construction of the corresponding @xmath0-boson nlcs is reported in section 3 resorting to standard tools of quantum optics , i.e. , the interaction representation and the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) .",
    "sections 4 and 5 are devoted to the special case of the single - boson nlcs .",
    "the relaxing of the rwa in order to remove the singularity problems is discussed in section 6 .",
    "the properties of the ion - trap systems and of their hamiltonians in various physical regimes have been widely investigated @xcite-@xcite . as for the construction of coherent states for ion - trap systems , in @xcite",
    "it has been proved that single - boson nlcs can be realized by exploiting the hamiltonian @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 of a two - level ion trapped in an external harmonic oscillator potential and interacting with two laser fields .",
    "the free hamiltonian @xmath3 describes the motion of both the electronic ( or internal ) and vibrational ( or external ) degrees of freedom of the ion , while the interaction hamiltonian @xmath6 corresponds to the interaction of the ion with the electromagnetic fields of the driving lasers .",
    "the external states of the ion are the ground state @xmath7 and the excited state @xmath8 , their transition frequency is @xmath9 @xmath2 @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the frequency of the trap harmonic potential . with @xmath12 the annihilation operator for the vibrational motion of the trapped ion , @xmath13 @xmath2 @xmath14 , @xmath15 the pauli matrix , which acts as a third component pseudospin operator , @xmath16 in eq . the zero energy level of the ion has been set at halfway between @xmath7 and @xmath8 , so that in outer product notation @xmath15 @xmath2 @xmath17 - @xmath18 .",
