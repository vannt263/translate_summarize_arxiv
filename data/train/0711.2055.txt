    "stellar winds are believed to play a pivotal role in the process of star formation . during the accretion phase of star formation , stellar winds carry away excess angular momentum that would otherwise prevent further collapse .",
    "the winds interact with and accelerate the surrounding medium , and as a result , drive molecular outflows with masses often much greater than that of the young star itself . however , the exact mechanism by which these winds interact with and accelerate the surrounding medium is still a matter of debate .",
    "a number of different models have been proposed including jets with bow shocks , jets with turbulent entrainment , and wide angle winds @xcite .",
    "the various models result in different spatial and velocity distributions of the entrained material , and therefore one approach to distinguish between the proposed models is to map the spatial and velocity structure of the outflowing molecular gas @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the various acceleration mechanisms heat the gas in different ways , resulting in changes in the chemistry of the outflow as ices are sublimated and endothermic reactions pathways are opened .",
    "thus , determinations of the chemical abundances of the outflowing molecular gas may permit us to distinguish between the various mechanisms .",
    "the review by @xcite suggested that molecules such as sio , ch@xmath11oh , h@xmath3o and sulfur - bearing molecules have their abundances affected by outflow activity .",
    "for example , @xcite study of l1157 revealed significant abundance variations and suggested that the chemistry of the outflows may be useful in understanding the time evolution of outflows",
    ".    the abundance of water can be strongly affected by shocks @xcite such as those predicted to exist in outflow regions .",
    "moderate velocity shocks are capable of producing large abundances of water by releasing frozen water from dust grains and by driving all free oxygen into water through a series of gas phase chemical reactions @xcite .",
    "thus , water should be a good tracer of shocks .",
    "the chemical reactions that produce water have been thoroughly modeled and it has been shown that the production mechanism and resulting abundance is very sensitive to temperature @xcite . at gas temperatures below @xmath12300 k water",
    "is formed most readily through a series of ion molecule reactions that lead to the formation of h@xmath11o@xmath13 .",
    "the dissociative recombination of h@xmath11o@xmath13 has several possible outcomes , but has been measured in the lab to produce water in approximately 25% of the interactions @xcite .",
    "this process of water production is relatively slow and modelling has shown that in a quiescent medium of density 10@xmath9 @xmath10 and temperature 30 k , a water abundance of roughly 10@xmath4 relative to molecular hydrogen is achieved after 10@xmath9 years @xcite .",
    "once the temperature of the gas rises above @xmath12300 k a series of endothermic neutral - neutral reactions are activated . at elevated temperatures ,",
    "these reactions are very rapid compared to the ion molecule reactions , and all free oxygen is quickly driven into water @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that the passage of a moderate c - shock with a velocity greater than @xmath1210 is able to elevate temperatures above 300 k long enough to produce greatly enhanced water abundances on the order of @xmath14 relative to h@xmath3 .",
    "more importantly , @xcite showed that the enhanced water abundance persists in the post - shock gas after the gas has cooled and to significantly reduce the water abundance required @xmath15 years even at densities as high as 10@xmath9 @xmath10 . since outflow ages",
    "are typically estimated to be of order 10@xmath9 years or less , any of the outflowing molecular gas that has passed through a moderate shock should be imprinted with this greatly elevated water abundance .",
    "after @xmath15 years the abundance of water will drop as the water chemistry comes into equilibrium at the lower gas temperature and water freezes onto the cold dust grains .",
    "evidence for this enhancement is quite apparent in the water observations of some outflows such as in orion - bn / kl @xcite .",
    "the ideal nature of water as a tracer of shocked regions is countered by the difficulty of detection from ground based observatories .",
    "this problem was overcome by the successful launch of three satellites , the _ infrared space observatory _",
    "( iso ) , the _ submillimeter wave astronomy satellite _ ( swas ) and _ odin_. iso was capable of detecting a number of water transitions excited in gas warmer than about 80 k @xcite while swas @xcite and _ odin _ @xcite can observe the fundamental ortho-2o @xmath16 transition at 538.3 @xmath7 m .",
    "more recently , the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ has detected several mid - infrared water transitions toward ngc 2071 @xcite .",
    "the fundamental transition of ortho-2ocan be readily excited at temperatures greater than about 20 k , permitting swas and _ odin _ to trace out much cooler post - shock gas than iso or _",
    "spitzer_. swas has detected ortho-2o emission associated with the quiescent dense molecular gas in numerous cloud cores .",
    "the relative abundance of ortho-2o to h@xmath3 in these regions was found to be on the order of @xmath1210@xmath17 to 10@xmath18 @xcite , roughly 2 orders of magnitude less abundant than predicted by quiescient gas phase chemistry .",
    "the discrepency is likely the result of water ice mantle formation on the dust grains @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present swas detections of 2o emission from 18 well studied outflow regions .",
    "we selected nearby outflows ( within 1 kpc ) with significant swas observations that we were able to obtain additional mapping data from the _ five college radio astronomy observatory _ ( fcrao ) .",
    "these outflows are driven by a mix of high and low luminosity young stellar objects ( ysos ) .",
    "eight of these outflows ( l1448-mm , ngc 1333-svs13 , hh25 mm , @xmath19 oph a ( vla1623 ) , l1689n , ser smm1 , l1157 , l1228 ) are driven by relatively low luminosity ysos that are in most cases individual low mass stars .",
    "the other ten sources ( gl490 , orion kl , omc 2 , ngc2071 , monr2 , ngc2264 d , ngc2264 c , ic 1396n , s140 , ceph a hw2 ) are driven by much higher luminosity ysos that are associated with newly forming groups and clusters .",
    "we combine the swas 2o detections with maps of and 3co emission obtained at the fcrao 14-m telescope to determine the water abundance in the outflowing gas .",
    "additionally , we use published iso results for six of these outflows to further expand our understanding of the swas results .",
    "swas was a nasa small explorer mission that operated successfully from 1998 to 2005 @xcite .",
    "swas simultaneously observed the @xmath16 transition of ortho-2o at 556.936 ghz , the j = 5 - 4 transition of 3co at 550.926 ghz , the 3,1 - 3,2 transition of o@xmath3 at 487.249 ghz , and the @xmath20 transition of [ ci ] at 492.161 ghz .",
    "o@xmath3 emission was not detected toward these outflows and these observations will not be discussed further .",
    "the high spectral resolution of swas ( @xmath120.6 ) permits the kinematic separation of the outflowing gas from the ambient material within star forming regions .",
    "however , a detailed analysis of the distribution of emission in these outflows is hindered by the limited angular resolution afforded by the small aperture of swas .",
    "the swas beam is elliptical , and at the frequency of the 2o and 3co transitions has angular dimensions of 3@xmath21.3 @xmath22 4@xmath21.5 and at the frequency of the o@xmath3 and [ ci ] transitions has angular dimensions of 3@xmath21.5 @xmath22 5@xmath21.0 @xcite .",
    "only one pointing was obtained for each source ; however , in most outflows the large beam encloses the entire region of outflow activity .",
    "observations of these outflows were obtained by swas over the entire period of mission operations .",
    "the positions observed for the 18 outflows are listed in table 1 .",
    "the data was acquired by nodding the satellite alternately between the source position and a reference position relatively free of @xmath1co emission .",
    "each position was observed over many orbits and the total integration time on source is listed in table 1 . for each observation , an equal time",
    "was spent integrating off source toward the reference position . the on - source integration time varied from about 6 to 90 hours and thus , the rms noise level achieved varied from source to source .",
    "the shortest integration time was for omc2 , where the rms noise measured in the baseline for the h@xmath3o and @xmath2co spectra was 0.028 k. the noise decreased as the square root of time and thus for one of the longer integration sources , @xmath19 oph a , an rms of 0.008 k was obtained . for the source with the longest integration time , gl490 ,",
    "the baselines were poorer and the rms noise obtained was only 0.010 k. details concerning data acquisition , calibration , and reduction with swas are presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the data shown in this paper are not corrected for the measured swas main beam efficiency of 0.90 @xcite ; however , this correction has been applied in our analysis .      during the fall of 2003 and the spring of 2004 ,",
    "the fcrao 14-m telescope was used to obtain maps of the emission at a rest frequency of 115.271 ghz and the 3co emission at a rest frequency of 110.201 ghz .",
    "the map centers were the same positions as those used for the swas observations .",
    "for all observations , the 32-pixel sequoia array receiver @xcite was used and data was obtained using an on - the - fly observing technique . for each source",
    "the observations were resampled to form maps approximately 6@xmath21.0 @xmath22 6@xmath21.0 in @xmath23 and @xmath24 in extent with data spaced by 25@xmath25 .",
    "the spectrometer for each pixel was a digital autocorrelator with a bandwidth of 50 mhz and 1024 spectral channels per pixel leading to a channel spacing of approximately 0.13 for both and 3co .",
    "the full - width - at - half - maximum beam size of the fcrao telescope at the frequency is 45@xmath25 .",
    "the spectra in these maps typically have an rms noise measured in the baseline of 0.06 k for @xmath2co and 0.17 k for @xmath1co .",
    "the two exceptions are l1689n and @xmath19 oph a which transit at low elevation at the latitude of the fcrao site and had an rms noise measured in the baseline of only 0.14 k for @xmath2co and 0.47 k for @xmath1co .",
    "the co data shown in this paper have not been corrected for main beam efficiency , estimated to be 0.45 at the frequency of the line and 0.49 at the frequency of the @xmath2co line .",
    "these corrections have been applied in all subsequent analysis .",
    "iso had a much greater wavelength coverage than swas and was capable of measuring the far - infrared emission from a variety of ortho- and para-2o transitions as well as a series of high - j co emission lines @xcite .",
    "published iso results are available for seven of the outflows in our sample : these outflows are l1448-mm @xcite , ngc1333 svs13 @xcite , ceph a hw2 @xcite , l1157 @xcite , l1689n @xcite , hh25 mm @xcite , orion kl @xcite , and ser smm1 @xcite .",
    "water lines were detected by iso in all of these outflows except ceph a hw2 .",
    "the published line fluxes that we use in this paper were all obtained with the lws instrument . with the exception of orion kl ,",
    "these spectra were obtained at relatively low spectral resolution ( r @xmath12 300 ) so they contain little velocity information .",
    "the lowest lying water line observed by iso is the @xmath26 transition at 179.5 @xmath7 m .",
    "this transition originates from a higher energy level ( e / k = 80 k ) than the transition observed by swas and therefore may probe a higher temperature component of water .",
    "iso has a smaller beam than swas ( @xmath1275  ) but the resolution is still too poor to permit a detailed spatial analysis .",
    "in figure 1 , we present the swas spectra of the @xmath16 transition of ortho-2o for the 18 outflows in our sample . each spectrum has only had a linear baseline removed .",
    "seven of the outflows presented in this paper have had swas data published previously : ngc 2071 and l1157 @xcite , l1448-mm and ic1396n @xcite , ngc1333 svs13 @xcite , s140 and mon r2 @xcite , and l1689n @xcite .",
    "l1157 , ic1396n and s140 have been reobserved by swas since the time of these publications and the complete spectra are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the initial observations of gl490 had a ripple in the baseline and so this source was reobserved .",
    "for the new observations the local oscillator setting was shifted to a value that limited the extent of useable spectrum on the blue side of the line . with the limited spectral coverage , placement of the baseline in gl490",
    "is more questionable than in the other outflows , and therefore the extent of the outflow emission in the blue wing is very uncertain .",
    "finally , for l1448-mm the position observed by swas and the center of the co mapping at fcrao was offset @xmath123  north - west of l1448-mm , the center of the large bipolar outflow .",
    "thus , our observations of l1448-mm primarily probe the blueshifted lobe of the outflow .",
    "the swas results for 3co and [ ci ] will be presented later in the paper .",
    "we have obtained nearly complete co maps of all 18 outflows . in only l1228 , l1448-mm and ngc2264 d",
    "does the molecular outflow extend appreciably beyond the 6@xmath27 region mapped .",
    "the co maps of hh25 mm and ser smm1 show obvious evidence of multiple outflows in the region mapped , and this has been noted previously @xcite .",
    "the swas spectra , although centered on hh25 mm and ser smm1 , include emission from other outflows in these regions . since all 18 of these outflow regions have been extensively studied and there are many published papers with outflow maps , we do not believe our co maps provide sufficient new information to justify showing here .",
    "a summary of the properties of these outflows and their driving sources are provided in the catalog introduced in @xcite .",
    "we convolved the co data to the swas resolution to compare 2o  and co line profiles .",
    "however , since the outflows do not fill the swas beam , convolving the co data to match the large swas beam substantially degraded the signal to noise in the high velocity co line wings making profile comparison difficult .",
    "so instead , we have chosen to co - average only those spectra which have an integrated intensity in either the red or blue outflow wings that is at least one - half of the integrated intensity of the peak wing emission . in these same positions we have also co -",
    "averaged the 3co spectra .",
    "both  and 3co  spectra averaged in this manner are shown accompanying the water spectra in figure 1 .",
    "it is worth noting a few features in the averaged co spectra .",
    "first , in ceph a hw2 there is a additional velocity feature at @xmath28 = 5  that is unlikely related to the outflow . in gl490 and l1228 a weak negative feature appears in these spectra , suggesting that the reference positions were not free of emission at all velocities .",
    "we excluded the velocity intervals associated with these features in the three sources in our subsequent analysis .",
    "a cursory inspection of the co and 2o  line profiles reveal many similarities that suggest that the emission in these lines likely originates in the same outflow component . with the exceptions of mon r2 , ngc 2264 d , and s140 ,",
    "the 2o  emission can be traced to a much higher outflow velocities than the co emission .",
    "this effect is most pronounced in the low luminosity outflows , such as l1157 or hh25 mm , and may be due to differences in the optical depth of these lines .",
    "the co j=1 - 0 transition is intrinsically weak , and we might expect the optical depth of this line to be less than the water line .",
    "higher rotational transitions of co , which have larger optical depths , do reveal higher velocity emission .",
    "a good example is l1448-mm where obervations of the j=2 - 1 transition of co @xcite reveal a velocity extent more similar to what is seen in the water line .",
    "although the detection of outflows is more difficult in the j=1 - 0 transition , the smaller optical depths make it ideal for deriving the outflow column density .",
    "we also find that the intensity ratio of the ortho-2o emission to emission increases with increasing outflow velocity .",
    "later in the paper we will model these emissions , including the effects of optical depth , and test whether the observed changes in the intensity ratio is due to variations in the water abundance with velocity .",
    "finally we note that nearly all of the 2o spectra show evidence for self - absorption similar to that seen in .",
    "the self - absorption feature is often much less evident in the co - added  spectra shown in figure 1 than it is in the individual  spectra obtained toward the center of the outflow .",
    "the self - absorption feature seen in both 2o  and  presumably arises due to foreground , quiescent , low - excitation gas absorbing the central part of the broad emission produced by the outflowing gas .",
    "to derive the water abundance from the swas ortho-2o observations , we must quantify the density , temperature and column density of the outflowing molecular gas .",
    "densities and temperatures are extremely difficult to determine in molecular outflows and few studies have attempted to measured these properties .",
    "some results are available concerning the gas temperature in outflows and are summarized in @xcite .",
    "however for the density , it is difficult to find any reliable estimates . in this paper",
    "we will simply assume values of temperature and density typical of star forming cores .",
    "specifically , we set the density to 10@xmath9 @xmath10 and the temperature we assume varies from 30 - 100 k , depending on the luminosity of the driving source . for outflows associated with low - luminosity ysos ( l1448-mm , ngc 1333 svs13 , hh25 mm , @xmath19 oph a , l1689n , ser smm1 , l1157 , l1228 and ic1396n ) we assume a temperature of 30 k. for outflows associated with more luminous ysos ( gl490 , omc2 , ngc2071 , monr2 , ngc 2264 d , ngc2264 c , s140 and ceph a hw2 ) we assume a temperature of 50 k and for orion kl we assume a temperature of 100 k. these assumptions are an oversimplification of the complex temperature and density structure likely to be present in these outflows .",
    "a number of outflows were systematically investigated by @xcite and the range of densities and temperatures estimated for outflows in this study are consistent with our assumptions .",
    "higher temperature gas is present in nearly all of the outflows studied here as evidenced by the presence of shock excited optical emission ( herbig - haro objects ) as well as highly excited lines of a variety of molecular species seen at infrared and far infrared wavelengths . in particular , iso has detected high - rotational transitions of co and 2o .",
    "however , the bulk of the outflowing molecular gas likely has much lower gas temperatures . in our analysis",
    "we will first address the emission from the cooler gas ( t = 30 - 100 k ) that we believe predominately gives rise to the emission in the lowest rotational transitions of co. in   4.6",
    "we will address specifically the emission from the warmer gas within the outflows .",
    "we derive the column density of outflowing gas based on the j=1 - 0 emission assuming the outflow gas temperature and density as described in the previous section .",
    "it is necessary to begin by identifying the velocity intervals over which emission from the outflowing gas dominates the ambient cloud emission . as our guide for setting these intervals , we have used the observed 3co  spectra and defined the break in line profile shape as the division between ambient and outflow emission .",
    "the intervals so defined are given in table 2 and illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "based on these velocity intervals , we compute the integrated intensity of the co emission in each map position for each outflow . the emission from the outflowing gas within the velocity interval around the quiescent cloud velocity",
    "is excluded in our analysis ; however , this velocity interval is relatively small and its exclusion will not strongly affect the results .",
    "the integrated intensity of co can be converted to a column density , assuming that the emission is optically thin and in lte . at the high densities assumed for the molecular outflow gas ( much greater than the critical density for ) the assumption of lte is extremely good .",
    "the total co column density can be written as    @xmath29    where t is the excitation temperature ( which is equivalent to the gas temperature in lte ) , and @xmath30 is the main beam antenna temperature ( antenna temperature corrected by the main beam efficiency ) of the j=1 - 0 transition of co.    although our assumption of lte is likely valid , we have no reason to believe that the observed high velocity emission is optically thin .",
    "our simultaneous observations of the 3co emission from the outflows enable us to test this thin assumption and , if necessary , correct for any optical depth effect .",
    "we estimate the optical depth of this gas by comparing the observed ratio of /3co emission to the assumed local interstellar medium ratio of 65 @xcite . assuming equal excitation temperatures for  and 3co , the relation between the observed isotopic line ratio , r , and the optical depth can be written as    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the optical depth of the emission .",
    "if we further assume that the 3co emission in the high velocity gas is optically thin ( @xmath32/65 @xmath33 1 ) then the ratio becomes @xmath34",
    "we then apply a correction to the column densities derived assuming the emission is optically thin , and the corrected column density is then simply    @xmath35    the sensitivity of our 3co  maps is insufficient to detect high velocity gas in individual spectra .",
    "because of the limited angular extent of the outflows , if we average over the entire map or even over the swas beam , we severely reduce the outflow signal in the averaged spectrum .",
    "therefore , we have averaged only those spectra that show evidence of the outflow in emission , following the method used to construct the and 3co spectra shown in figure 1 .",
    "the redshifted and blueshifted gas were considered separately , unlike the method used to produce the spectra shown in figure 1 , and only those positions with integrated areas greater than one - half the peak value detected for the redshifted or blueshifted outflow in that source were selected and averaged together .",
    "the 3co profiles were created by averaging the same positions selected by the emission . the observed isotope ratio in either the redshifted or blueshifted outflow is then measured from these averaged spectra .",
    "the measured isotopic ratios are presented in table 2 .",
    "the measured value of r is typically between 20 and 30 which correspond to optical depths of 3.0 to 1.8 and to column density corrections of a factor of 3.3 to 2.2 .",
    "the average optical depth correction is used to correct the optically thin derived column density throughout each outflow lobe .",
    "the swas observations of the j=5 - 4 transition of 3co can be used to test our adopted phyical properties and derived gas column density of these outflows .",
    "the emission in this line originates from an upper state with an energy of e / k = 79 k ; thus it is particularly sensitive to the assumed temperature in the range considered for these outflows .",
    "significant 3co j=5 - 4 emission was detected in seven of the outflows ( ceph a hw2 , gl490 , monr2 , ngc2071 , orion kl , omc 2 and s140 ) all driven by luminous ysos . for outflows associated with lower luminosity ysos , 3co j=5 - 4 emission was either extremely weak or not detected .",
    "this general trend is consistent with our assumption that the outflowing gas associated with more luminous ysos is warmer than that in the lower luminosity ysos .",
    "however , a more quantitative test of our physical model can be made .    using the computed co gas column density and the assumed temperature and density for the outflows",
    ", we can predict the emission in the 3co j=5 - 4 transition at each location in the outflow where we have determined the outflow column density . as in our previous column density determination",
    ", we assume that the abundance ratio of co to 3co is 65 .",
    "we convolve the map of predicted emission with the swas beam , and compute the predicted 3co j=5 - 4 line flux in each of the outflows and compare that with the line flux observed by swas .",
    "we find that for most of the sources with significant 3co j=5 - 4 emission that the modeled and observed line fluxes are consistent within a factor of 2 .",
    "the agreement is remarkably good , since only small changes in the density and temperature can greatly affect the line flux .",
    "the most discrepant outflows were mon r2 and gl490 , where the modeled line flux was 3 to 6 times larger than that observed . in three of the outflows associated with luminous ysos , ic1396n ,",
    "ngc2264 c and ngc2264 d , there was no detectable 3co j=5 - 4 emission ; however , in all cases the non - detections are consistent with the model predictions . for the outflows associated with low luminosity ysos , only @xmath19 oph a and l1689n have possible weak outflow detections in the 3co j=5 - 4 line , and the other sources ( l1448-mm , ngc1333-svs13 svs3 , hh25 mm , ser smm1 , l1157 , and l1228 ) were not detected .",
    "we find again that for these low - luminosity outflows with weak detections or only upper limits the results are consistent in most cases with our model .",
    "the one exception is hh25 mm , where the modeled flux exceeds the 3@xmath36 upper limit by a factor of approximately 3 to 5 . in all cases where there is poor agreement ,",
    "the model predictions exceed the observed line flux suggesting that we have either overestimated the temperature or density in our outflow model .",
    "we have used two of the most discrepant outflows , monr2 and hh25 mm , to estimate the magnitude to which we may have overestimated either the density or temperature in our outflow models .",
    "unfortunately with only the 3co j=5 - 4 data it is impossible to derive a unique temperature and density for the outflows , since both parameters affect the observed line flux . for these calculations",
    "we have recomputed the gas column density using the modified temperature or density and then recomputed the predicted 3co j=5 - 4 emission . in monr2",
    ", we have found that by reducing the temperature from 50 to 30 k we can obtain good line flux agreement .",
    "however , we can also maintain the temperature at 50 k and reduce the density by a factor of 5 and obtain good agreement .",
    "of course the correct solution could be a combination of both a lower temperature and a lower density . likewise in hh25 mm",
    ", we can achieve good flux agreement by either lowering the temperature from 30 to 20 k or by decreasing the density by a factor of 4 .",
    "nevertheless , in most outflows the line flux agreement suggests that the temperature is probably accurate to 20% and the density accurate to within a factor of two .",
    "the mass of outflowing redshifted and blueshifted gas in each outflow can be found using our map of the co column density and the distances given in table 1 .",
    "we have assumed a co / h@xmath3 ratio of 1@xmath2210@xmath6 for the mass determinations which are summarized in table 2 .",
    "the statistical errors on the observed integrated intensity of are small , and the uncertanity in our mass estimates are dominated by the uncertainties in our assumed temperature , correction for optical depth , and co to h@xmath3 conversion .",
    "uncertainties in density have little impact on the mass determination , unless it is substantially lower that the value we assumed .",
    "our method for estimating the water abundance requires a knowledge of the spatial distribution of the column density of outflowing gas . for this analysis , which we describe in the next section",
    ", we have only included positions which have a @xmath37 detection of .",
    "the mass estimates in table 2 are based only on positions within the outflow with co detections , and thus may underestimate the total outflow mass . statistically we can provide a much better estimate of the total outflow mass by using all the positions , regardless of whether the integrated intensity is positive or negative .",
    "we have recomputed the mass of each outflow without applying a detection threshold , and find masses in the redshifted and blueshifted outflows that are at most only ten percent larger than those presented in table 2 .",
    "we first estimate the ortho-2o abundance in the outflows assuming that the 2o  emission seen by swas originates in the same gas as traced by the co j=1 - 0 emission .",
    "later we will explore whether this is reasonable assumption and if there are other possibilities for its origin .",
    "the integrated intensity of the swas 2o  line in each outflow has been determined using the same velocity intervals that were used for co. the observed integrated intensity and line flux for the redshifted and blueshifted emission is given in table 2 .",
    "we model the water emission using a statistical equilibrium code that uses the large velocity gradient ( lvg ) approximation to account for radiation trapping .",
    "the lvg assumption should be a valid approximation for the observed broad - line emission from these outflows .",
    "collisional rate coefficients are taken from @xcite .",
    "since the ortho - h@xmath3 and para - h@xmath3 collisional rate coefficients with 2o  are different by nearly an order of magnitude , the assumed ratio of ortho - h@xmath3 to para - h@xmath3 is important .",
    "we have assumed that the ratio of ortho- to para - h@xmath3 is in lte as found for the outflows studied by @xcite .",
    "thus for our assumed gas temperatures of 30 , 50 and 100 k , the ratio of ortho- to para - h@xmath3 is approximately 0.03 , 0.3 and 1.6 , respectively .",
    "we include the five lowest levels of ortho-2o in our calculation .",
    "the physical inputs to our 2o  model are the temperature , density , and column density distribution of the outflowing gas .",
    "we have used the same temperature and density as described earlier for computing the co column density .",
    "the process of solving for the abundance begins by assuming a water abundance and then computing the predicted water emission at each position in the outflow .",
    "we convolve the predicted emission with the swas beam , and then compare with the observed integrated intensity .",
    "the abundance of ortho-2o is then varied until we achieve agreement between model and observations .",
    "this approach is very similar to that used by @xcite and has the advantage of correctly accounting for optical depth variations and beam dilution effects across the large swas beam based on our measured gas column density distribution . since the input to our model is the measured co column density , our analysis provides a direct determination of the ortho-2o abundance relative to co. we infer an abundance of ortho-2o relative to h@xmath3 by assuming a  to h@xmath3 ratio of 10@xmath6 .",
    "the resulting ortho-2o abundances relative to h@xmath3 are presented in table 2 .",
    "we have investigated the impact on the relative ortho-2o  abundance for different assumed temperatures and densities . unless the assumed density is dramatically decreased , density uncertainties have little impact on the determination of the co column density .",
    "however , density does have a big effect on ortho-2o  abundance . since the water emission in these outflows is approximately in the effectively thin limit @xcite ,",
    "the abundance derived will be inversely proportional to the assumed density .",
    "thus , if we were to assume a density a factor of two larger , the resulting ortho-2o  abundance will be a factor of two smaller .",
    "changes in the assumed temperature , on the other hand , will effect both the derived column density of co and ortho-2o abundance . we have used the redshifted outflows of monr2 and l1689n as test cases . in each case we have increased and decreased the temperature by a factor of two and recomputed the co column density and ortho-2o  abundance .",
    "we found for these outflows that increasing the temperature by a factor of two results in a decrease in the relative abundance of ortho-2o by a factor of 3 in mon r2 and by a factor of 8 in l1689n .",
    "decreasing the temperature by a factor of two results in an increase in the derived ortho-2o abundance by a factor of 9 in mon r2 and by a factor of 5 in l1689n .",
    "thus , our derived ortho-2o abundances are very sensitive to the assumed physical conditions in the outflowing gas , which is unfortunate since these conditions are very poorly known .",
    "thus , the systematic errors introduced by our poor knowledge of the outflow density and temperature dominate over the uncertainties in the 2o  line fluxes in determinations of the water abundance .",
    "the abundance of 2o  relative to h@xmath3 spans a wide range of values , from 10@xmath38 to 10@xmath18 .",
    "this range of abundances is so large , we believe it is unlikely due to only uncertainites in the physical conditions and must reflect true abundance variations .",
    "we note that the results for ngc2071 and l1157 are in good agreement with the abundances reported earlier by @xcite that are also based on the swas data .",
    "we find the highest 2o  abundances are found in orion kl and l1157 , and the lowest abundance in mon r2 .",
    "our derived ortho-2o abundances in nearly all of the outflows are much larger than that derived for quiescent molecular cloud gas ( @xmath1210@xmath17 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which suggests some enhancement of the water abundance in outflows .",
    "the largest abundance derived , @xmath1210@xmath38 in orion kl , is still less than one might expect if all of the free oxygen had been coverted into water as is expected for a moderate shock .",
    "it is very important to remember that these abundance estimates are averages over the entire swas beam , and do not rule out the possibility of much higher abundances existing over a small portion of these outflows .",
    "in fact , in the warm gas probed by iso , the abundance of 2o  is as high as 5@xmath2210@xmath6 in the warm gas in orion kl and l1448-mm @xcite .",
    "the relationship of the warm gas probed by iso and the emission seen by swas will be examined in more detail in   4.6 .",
    "the high spectral resolution of swas enables us to further investigate the abundance of 2o as a function of velocity . in the previous section we assumed that the ortho-2o abundance is constant thoughout the outflow .",
    "we will now investigate whether the abundance of ortho-2o relative to varies with outflow velocity .",
    "we have divided the redshifted and blueshifted emission from the outflowing gas in co and 2o  into velocity bins , each of width 5 , continuing to higher velocities until is not detected . for a velocity interval to be analyzed",
    ", at least two positions within the outflow must have significant detections of emission .",
    "the integrated 2o   intensity and line flux as a function of velocity are presented in table 3 for each outflow .",
    "optical depth corrections were considered separately for each velocity interval using the same averaged co spectra as described before . any interval with a non - detection of 3co",
    "was assumed to be optically thin , which is often the case at the higher velocities in the outflows .",
    "we then used the same technique as discussed above to model each of the individual velocity intervals .",
    "the results of our analysis are presented in table 3 , which includes the observed co isotopic ratio , the mass of gas , and the ortho-2o  abundance as a function of velocity .",
    "our abundance analysis requires  detections .",
    "although , earlier we suggested that including only 3 @xmath36 detections had only small effect on the total outflow mass , the impact of truncation is more severe in the higher velocity bins where the signal to noise of the  emission is relatively low .",
    "we have recomputed the mass in each velocity bin without applying a detection threshold , and found that in the most discrepant bins , which are at the highest velocities , the mass could be underestimated by a factor of 2 to 3 .",
    "thus , the ortho-2o  abundances quoted may by overestimated by a similar factor . despite these uncertainties",
    ", we find that in every outflow the derived abundance of ortho-2o increases steadily with increasing outflow velocity .",
    "even outflows that did not show obvious disparate velocity extents between co and 2o  show ortho-2o  abundance variations with velocity .",
    "some of the most pronouced abundance variations with velocity are in the outflows driven by low - luminosity ysos ; for example in ngc1333-svs13 the ortho-2o  abundance in both the redshifted and blueshifted high velocity gas increases by two orders of magnitude from the lowest velocity outflowing gas to the highest velocity outflowing gas . at the highest outflow velocities , the abundance of ortho-2o  relative to h@xmath3 gas can be as high as @xmath39 , approaching values that one might expect if all of the oxygen not in co is converted into 2o as anticipated if the gas has recently passed through a moderate velocity shock . however , since most of the outflow mass is at relatively low outflow velocities , the mass of gas with this highly elevated ortho-2o abundance represents less than 1% of the total mass of outflowing gas , although , it accounts for a much larger fraction of total water line flux .      iso with the lws detected both high - j co lines and a number of ortho- and para-2o lines in eight of the molecular outflows in our survey .",
    "the lines observed by iso likely arise in a much warmer gas than is responsible for the bulk of the low - j co outflow emission that we have modeled . for water , the lowest excitation line observed by iso ( the @xmath26 transition at 179.5 @xmath7 m ) has a flux in most sources more than 10 times larger than that predicted by the outflow models discussed in previous sections .",
    "thus , the iso water emission must be produced by a warmer , likely shock - excited component , of the outflowing gas .",
    "many authors @xcite have suggested that most of the iso emission comes from non - dissociative c - shocks with shock velocities of order 15 to 25 km s@xmath8 and pre - shock densities of order 10@xmath40 to 10@xmath9 @xmath10 . a significant enhancement of water in these post - shocked regions",
    "is needed to explain the iso observations .",
    "many note that the strong [ oi ] emission detected in all of these outflows and the detection of [ siii ] in some of the outflows , may require the presence of dissociating j - shocks .",
    "@xcite compared the water emission observed by swas and iso in four outflows and suggested that warm , approximately 1000 k , gas was responsible for the iso emission and some of the swas emission , however they also concluded that swas was also sensitive to a cooler gas component not traced by iso .",
    "we have used the published line fluxes for l1448-mm @xcite , ngc1333-svs13 @xcite , l1157 @xcite ,",
    "l1689n @xcite , hh25 mm @xcite , ser smm1 @xcite and orion kl @xcite to perform a simple c - shock model analysis .",
    "we note that @xcite reported two pointings of iso toward the ceph a hw2 outflow ; however , 2o  emission was not detected , so we have not included this source in our analysis .",
    "our modeling is aimed at estimating the shock solid angle responsible for producing the iso emission and whether any significant fraction of the swas water line flux originates in this shocked gas . in table 4",
    "we present the flux in the 179.5 @xmath7 m line of ortho-2o  observed by iso for the six outflows with detected emission that were in common with our survey . in l1448-mm , ngc1333-svs13 , and l1157 multiple positions were observed by iso and we have combined the fluxes for positions that are within the swas beam . in addition to co and 2o , iso detected relatively strong 63 @xmath7 m [ oi ] emission in these outflows @xcite .    to analyze the iso emission , we use the c - shock models of @xcite .",
    "we have integrated the line intensity contributions in the post - shock gas of these c - shock models to the point where the gas has cooled to a temperature of 50 k. at that point the gas is too cool to contribute much intensity to the observed iso lines and the freeze out of water onto dust grains may become important , which is not included in this model .",
    "in addition , the postshock gas has become indistingishable from the gas previously modeled .",
    "we can use the high - j co and 2o  lines in conjunction with these c - shock model results to constrain the shock velocity and pre - shock gas density .",
    "the flux in the high - j co lines and in the 179.5 @xmath7 m transition of ortho-2o   are used to establish the correct c - shock model .",
    "the intensity ratio of the high - j co lines , specifically the ratio of the j=20 - 19 transition to j=15 - 14 transition , is very sensitive to the temperature of the post - shock gas , and therefore provides a constraint on the shock velocity .",
    "the ratio of the co j=15 - 14 line flux to 179.5 @xmath7 m water line flux is sensitive to pre - shock density .",
    "although these line ratios vary somewhat from outflow to outflow , all outflows require shock velocities @xmath41  to produce the observed ratio of co lines . for example",
    "the average co line flux ratio of the j=20 - 19/j=15 - 14 transitions observed is 0.45 , and this ratio requires a shock velocity of 40  for a pre - shock gas density of 10@xmath40 @xmath10 or 20  for a pre - shock gas density of 10@xmath9 @xmath10 . to reproduce the observed flux ratio of co j=15 - 14 to 179.5 @xmath7 m 2o , typically about unity , requires post - shock densities of @xmath42 10@xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "we have adopted a c - shock model with a shock velocity of 25  and a pre - shock density of 10@xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "the column of post - shock h@xmath3 gas in this c - shock model to the point where the gas has cooled to 50 k is @xmath43 @xmath44 and the integrated intensity of the 179.5 @xmath7 m 2o  line produced by this column of post - shock gas is @xmath45 ergs s@xmath8 @xmath44 sr@xmath8 .",
    "the 2o  abundance relative to h@xmath3 in the post - shock gas is @xmath46 .",
    "based on this adopted c - shock model we estimate the total solid angle of shock front needed to reproduce the observe line flux and consequently the total mass of shocked gas ; these results are given in table 4 . with the exception of orion kl ,",
    "the angular area of these shocked regions is only @xmath1210 square arcseconds , much smaller that the angular area of the outflow mapped in the low - j co lines or the swas and iso beamsizes",
    ". however for orion kl , the angular size is about 1280 square arcseconds , comparable to the angular size of the outflow mapped in the low - j rotational lines of co @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite modeled over 70 far - infrared rotational lines of water observed by iso with the lws .",

    "the results of @xcite are similar to what we quoted earlier based on the swas data . unlike the other outflows , the water emission observed by iso in orion kl may arise from the same gas that is responsible for producing the low - j co emission .    with exception of orion kl ,",
    "the mass of warm gas needed to reproduce the iso observed lines is only 0.0008 to 0.005 solar masses .",
    "our mass estimates are similar to those reported by @xcite based on a thermal model with temperatures between 600 and 1400 k. thus , the mass of warm gas responsible for producing the iso lines is only about 1% of the total outflowing gas mass inferred from our earlier analysis of the j=1 - 0  line . for orion kl ,",
    "the mass in the shell model presented by @xcite is of order 6 solar masses , similar to our total mass estimate from the low - j co lines .",
    "these warm , postshock gas regions probed by iso also produce emission in the 538 @xmath7 m line observed by swas .",

    "the observed flux ratio of these lines is summarized in table 4 .",
    "it is important to remember that the iso observations are made in a smaller beam than swas ( @xmath1275  ) , so that a single iso observation may not detect all of the 179 @xmath7 m emission that is contained within a swas beam . even in the outflows with multiple iso pointings ,",
    "the entire swas beam is not fully sampled , thus the observed line flux ratios in table 4 are only lower limits .",
    "we estimate that the fraction of the swas water line flux that originates in the warm , post - shock gas to be as little as 10% in some outflows to more than 50 % in others .",
    "@xcite reached a similar conclusion .",
    "it may be significant that the two outflows with the most complete iso coverage ( l1448-mm and orion kl ) have the largest line flux ratios .",
    "a significant fraction of the swas water line flux may be arising from the very small mass of warm post - shock gas .",
    "swas obtained very high signal to noise spectra of [ ci ] toward these outflow sources .",
    "obvious high velocity [ ci ] emission was detected in mon r2 , l1228 , ceph a hw2 , orion kl , and s140 and spectra of [ ci ] in these sources are shown in figure 2 .",
    "although no high velocity emission was detected in l1448-mm , the baseline in this source was somewhat worse .",
    "also in ser smm1 , the blue wing of the [ ci ] line was contaminated by emission in the reference position .",
    "the presence of high velocity [ ci ] emission in many of these outflows was previously noted by @xcite and @xcite .    in orion kl , the spectrum shown in figure 2 appears to have an additional emission feature at a velocity of about 45 km s@xmath8 .",
    "it is unlikely that this feature is related to the redshifted outflowing gas , as the line profile would have to be significantly different from those observed in either co or 2o .",
    "the line is unlikely to arise from the opposite sideband .",
    "since swas does not doppler track in real time , frequency corrections are applied to each short time segment in the data pipeline , and thus lines in the opposite sideband should not add coherently to produce such a discrete feature .",
    "assuming this feature is in the same sideband as [ ci ] and originates in gas with a v@xmath49 of 9 km s@xmath8 , then the line frequency is approximately 492.10 ghz .",
    "we searched the jpl line list for relatively low excitation lines of molecules known to be present in orion and the only candidates are the 13@xmath50 - 13@xmath51 transition of ch@xmath11cho - e at 492.093 ghz and the 13@xmath52 - 13@xmath53 transition of c@xmath3h@xmath54oh at 492.086 ghz .",
    "the lines of ch@xmath11cho are extremely weak in the spectrum of orion @xcite , and thus is probably an unlikely identification for the feature seen by swas .",
    "ethanol , on the other hand has a number of lines detected in the 336 to 340 ghz range at several locations in orion @xcite , but the frequency of the transition is significantly lower than is needed to explain the swas feature .",
    "none of the previously published spectra of [ ci ] in orion kl had adequate sensitivity to confirm or refute this feature .",
    "using the same velocity intervals as defined earlier for the redshifted and blueshifted emission in each outflow , we have computed the [ ci ] outflow line flux .",
    "a summary of the [ ci ] line flux is presented in table 5 .",
    "we note that we have included the feature seen within the redshifted emission in orion kl as part of the integrated intensity of the outflow .",
    "although we have [ ci ] detections in these velocity intervals for most of the outflow sources , in many cases the emission may be dominated by the gaussian wings of the quiescent line emission .",
    "we computed the ci abundance in an identical manner as we computed the 2o  abundance , using the same physical model for each of the outflows .",
    "the resulting ci abundance relative to h@xmath3 is summarized in table 5 .",
    "we find that the abundance of ci relative to h@xmath3 is typically about 1@xmath48 .",
    "the largest abundance of ci is found for ngc2264 d and @xmath19 oph a. however , in ngc2264 d it is questionable whether the weak [ ci ] emission in the red or blue shifted velocity intervals is related to the outflow . very weak",
    "( t@xmath55 @xmath12 0.05 k ) and very broad [ ci ] emission is detected toward @xmath19 oph a , similar to the emission profile seen in 2o .",
    "the ci abundance in @xmath19 oph a is about five times larger than in the other outflow . for quiescent cloud emission",
    "the abundance of ci relative to co is typically 0.1 to 0.5 @xcite , similar to that determined for the outflowing gas if we assume a co to h@xmath3 ratio of 1@xmath56 .",
    "thus the ci in the outflowing gas is similar in abundance to that of the ambient gas in agreement with the results of @xcite .",
    "the [ ci ] spectra have insufficient signal to noise to investigate variations of the ci abundance with outflow velocity .",
    "the 1@xmath57 transition of ortho-2o  at 538 @xmath7 m has been detected by swas in 18 molecular outflows .",
    "the 2o  line profiles are similar to the line profiles observed for the j=1 - 0 transition of  and suggest that the emission seen in both species may be produced by the same gas . if we assume that the swas 2o  emission arises in the same gas that makes up the bulk of the molecular outflow , we find that the outflowing gas has an ortho-2o  abundance relative to h@xmath3 typically between 10@xmath5 and 10@xmath4 . however , there are a few exceptions : most notably orion kl and l1157 have anomalously high relative ortho-2o  abundances of about 10@xmath38 , and mon r2 has an anomalously low relative abundance of about 10@xmath18 .",
    "the relative ortho-2o  abundances in table 2 have substantial uncertainty that arise almost solely due to the sensitivity of the derived water abundances to the assumed temperature and density of the outflowing gas , both of which are poorly known .",
    "the 3co j=5 - 4 observations by swas suggest that our physical model can not be too much in error .",
    "and thus we believe that the abundance of water in most of these outflows is elevated relative to that measured in quiescent cloud gas .",
    "we also derive the ci abundance in the outflowing gas , and find values that are similar to quiescent cloud material , and thus unlike water , the abundance of atomic carbon appears to be unaffected by the outflow activity .",
    "we also analyzed the velocity dependence of 2o , and find that the abundance of ortho-2o   varies significantly with velocity . in nearly all of the outflows , we find a steady increase in the ortho-2o  abundance with increasing radial velocity of the outflowing gas . in the most striking examples ( ngc 1333 svs13 and hh25 mm ) , the abundance of water increases by two orders of magnitude from the lowest velocity to the highest velocity outflowing gas",
    "nevertheless , the mass of outflowing gas with greatly elevated 2o  abundance is very small , representing at most only @xmath121% of the total outflow gas mass .",
    "the iso observations provide evidence for the presence of a much warmer outflow component in those outflows observed . with the exception of orion kl ,",
    "our c - shock modeling of the iso emission suggest that this warm gas constitutes less than 1 % of the total outflow mass and arises from an extremely small fraction of the molecular outflow solid angle .",
    "however , this gas is expected to have a relative abundance of water in excess of 10@xmath6 .",
    "the presence of this warmer component adds an additional complexity to abundance determinations in the cooler gas .",
    "our shock modeling , although simple , suggests that a significant fraction of the water line flux observed by swas could arise in this warmer gas component . unfortunately the iso observations did not cover the full extent of the swas beam nor did it have velocity resolution , so it is extremely uncertain what fraction of the swas line flux is associated with this warm gas probed by iso .",
    "we estimate that for the outflows with both iso and swas observations , as much as 50 %  of the swas flux could originate in the warmer gas component .",
    "if any significant fraction of the swas 2o  line flux arises from the warm gas , then we have overestimated the line flux from the cooler gas traced by the low - j transitions of co , and consequently overestimated the ortho-2o  abundance in this cool gas .",
    "therefore our estimates of the water abundance presented in table 2 are likely to be too large .",
    "the extent to which the abundance is overestimated is very uncertain , but if only half of the swas line flux is due to the warm gas this only reduces the 2o  abundance by a factor of two , which is well below other uncertainties in our abundance determination . thus , unless nearly all of the swas line flux is due to this small mass of warm , shocked gas , the ortho-2o  abundance in the low velocity outflowing gas is enhanced relative to that measured for quiescent cloud gas ( relative abundance of only 10@xmath17 to 10@xmath18 according to @xcite ) .    the studies by @xcite and @xcite demonstrated that even a mild c - shock with shock velocities greater than 10 km s@xmath8 will elevate the gas temperature to permit the efficient conversion of oxygen into water and to vaporize a large fraction of the water ice on grains .",
    "thus , most of the oxygen , not in co , will be rapidly converted into water resulting in relative water abundances in excess of 10@xmath6 .",
    "@xcite suggested that these elevated levels of water will persist long after the gas has cooled and any enhancement of the water abundance may be present over the entire lifetime of these outflows .",
    "the relative abundance of 2o  is thus a good tracer of the dynamical history of the outflowing molecular gas .",
    "our analysis of the swas data rules out the possibility that most of the outflow gas has passed through a shock in excess of 10 km s@xmath8 .",
    "the iso and high velocity swas results for some outflows do indicate highly elevated water abundances in a small fraction of the outflowing gas mass that is consistent with moderate velocity c - shocks .",
    "the current observations however do not have sufficient spatial and/or velocity resolution to determine exactly how these emissions might be related .",
    "it is suggestive that since the mass associated with the iso and high velocity swas 2o  emission are very similar that these may arise from the same c - shock .",
    "for these outflows it would be extremely interesting to determine the spatial and kinematic relation between the iso emission , the high velocity swas emission and well - established tracers of c - shocks , such as the 2.12 @xmath7 m h@xmath3 emission seen in many of these outflows such as l1448-mm @xcite and ngc1333-svs13 @xcite .",
    "future observations with _ herschel _ may help out in this regards .",
    "mechanisms for suppressing the 2o  abundance in the postshock gas were explored by @xcite .",
    "the only mechanism that is probably relevant for these outflows is the freeze - out of gas - phase water onto grain mantles .",
    "this was the primary mechanism in the model of @xcite for the reduction of gas - phase water in post - shock gas .",
    "the timescale for significant depletion of gas - phase water depends on the post shock density of the gas and the total grain cross - section . in the model of @xcite , for gas denser than 10@xmath58 @xmath10 , the timescale is shorter than 10@xmath40 years , however at densities of 10@xmath40 @xmath10 the time scale is longer than 3@xmath47 years .",
    "however since outflow lifetimes are extremely poorly understood , it is possible that the freeze - out of water is an important factor",
    ". based on the timescale for water freeze - out , @xcite provided a simple expression for the hydrogen column density in the post - shock gas to the point where water will be frozen onto grain mantles .",
    "this calculation uses a slightly larger grain cross - section than the numerical model of @xcite . assuming a shock velocity of 10 km s@xmath8 and a shock compression factor of 10 , the molecular hydrogen column would be of order 10@xmath59 @xmath44 .",
    "if the relative abundance of ortho-2o  in this column was as @xmath6010@xmath6 , as predicted by the c - shock models , the emission from this gas would greatly exceed what swas observed .",
    "unless a more efficient mechanism is found for depleting the gas - phase water in the post - shock gas , we believe that the 2o  abundance in outflows provides strong evidence that the bulk of the outflowing molecular gas was never subjected to shocks greater than 10 km s@xmath8 that would convert all of gas phase oxygen to water",
    ". this result places severe restrictions on the mechanism by which the molecular gas is accelerated in these outflows and favor mechanisms , such as turbulent entrainment , that can accelerate the gas gently .",
    "however , some enhancement of the water abundance in the bulk of the outflowing gas over that measured in quiescent cloud gas may be necessary .",
    "slower shocks ( @xmath61 10 km s@xmath8 ) could heat the gas and dust to temperatures above the water - ice evaporation temperature , but below the temperature in which the rapid neutral - neutral reactions are activited , a suggestion made by @xcite for the water abundance measured in orion kl ..    finally we note that strong [ oi ] emission at a wavelength of 63 @xmath7 m was observed by iso in all of the outflows . many of the papers presenting iso outflow results suggest that the origin of the [ oi ] emission is in j - shocks that dissociate the molecular gas .",
    "alternatively , the [ oi ] emission could arise from the same weak shocks that accelerate the bulk of the molecular gas .",
    "future observations with _ herschel _ , which has better angular and spectral resolution , may help determine the relationship between the 2o  and [ oi ] emissions and other shock tracers in these outflows and provide a better understanding of the evolution of the 2o  abundance in these outflows .",

    "<S> we present detections of the ground - state @xmath0 transition of ortho-2o  at 557 ghz in 18 molecular outflows based on data from the _ submillimeter wave astronomy satellite _ ( swas ) . </S>",
    "<S> these results are combined with ground - based observations of the j=1 - 0 transitions of @xmath1co and @xmath2co obtained at the _ five college radio astronomy observatory _ ( fcrao ) . </S>",
    "<S> data from _ infrared space observatory _ ( iso ) for a subset of the outflows are also discussed . assuming the swas water line emission originates from the same gas traced by co emission , we find that the outflowing gas in most outflows has an ortho-2o  abundance relative to h@xmath3 of between about 10@xmath4 and 10@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of the water abundance as a function of outflow velocity reveals a strong dependence . </S>",
    "<S> the abundance of ortho-2o  increases with velocity and at the highest outflow velocities some of the outflows have relative ortho-2o   abundances of order 10@xmath6 . however the mass of very high velocity gas with such elevated 2o  abundances represents less that 1% of the total outflow gas mass . </S>",
    "<S> the iso lws observations of high - j rotational lines of co and the 179.5 @xmath7 m transition of ortho-2o  provide evidence for a warmer outflow component than required to produce either the swas or fcrao lines . </S>",
    "<S> the iso line flux ratios can be reproduced with c - shock models with shock velocities of order 25 km s@xmath8 and preshock densities of order 10@xmath9 @xmath10 ; these c - shocks have post - shock relative water abundances greater than 10@xmath6 . the mass associated with the iso emission is also quite small compared with the total outflow mass , and is similar to that responsible for the highest velocity water emission detected by swas . </S>",
    "<S> although the gas responsible for the iso emission has elevated levels of water , the bulk of the outflowing gas has an abundance of ortho-2o  well below what would be expected if the gas has passed through a c - shock with shock velocities greater than 10 km s@xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> gas - phase water can be depleted in the post - shock gas due to freeze - out onto grain mantles , however the rate of freeze - out is too slow to explain our results . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we believe that only a small fraction of the outflowing molecular gas has passed through shocks strong enough to fully convert the gas - phase oxygen to water . </S>",
    "<S> this result has implications for the acceleration mechanism of the molecular gas in these outflows . </S>"
