    "cytoskeletal proteins such as actin filaments , intermediate filaments and microtubules are rigid multifilament polymers that play a variety of roles in biological systems , including organization of cell structures , transport of organelles and vesicles , cell motility and reproduction.@xcite biological functions of these proteins are mostly determined by the processes that take place during their polymerization . however , our understanding of the coupling between these biopolymer s structure and functions and their growth processes is still very limited .    in recent years",
    "the number of experimental investigations of the growth mechanisms and dynamic properties of rigid multifilament biopolymers at a single - molecule level increased significantly.@xcite dynamic behavior of individual microtubules have been characterized by a variety of experimental techniques such as video and electron microscopy , fluorescence spectroscopy , and optical trap spectrometry,@xcite whereas the studies of the single actin filaments have just begun.@xcite many unusual phenomena in the assembly dynamics of these biopolymers have been observed , such as treadmilling for microtubules and actin filaments,@xcite and microtubule dynamic instability .",
    "@xcite    recent experimental investigations of the single actin filament length fluctuations@xcite raised many questions about the actin polymerization dynamics .",
    "a large discrepancy in kinetic rate constants estimated by average length change in the initial polymerization phase and from the analysis of length fluctuations in the steady - state phase ( a factor of 40 ) has been observed .",
    "one of the possible explanations for this discrepancy might be the oversimplified theoretical model , used in analysis,@xcite that neglected the polymer structure and lateral monomer - monomer interactions at the actin filament tips .",
    "similar problems have been found in the growth dynamics of individual microtubules under the influence of external forces.@xcite for example , the depolymerization rate constants determined from a phenomenological description of microtubule dynamics , that do not incorporate the biopolymer s structure and lateral interactions between the filaments , contradict to values measured in some independent bulk chemical kinetic experiments.@xcite    a large volume of experimental results stimulated many theoretical investigations of polymerization dynamics for rigid multifilament proteins . in one approach , it was suggested that the growth of rigid biopolymers is controlled by thermal fluctuations .",
    "@xcite this is a basic idea of the so - called polymerization ratchet models . in a different approach ,",
    "more phenomenological chemical kinetic ( stochastic ) models have been used to describe the biopolymer s growth dynamics.@xcite in these simplified phenomenological models it is assumed that the overall dynamics is a balance between polymerization and depolymerization processes , however the microscopic details of the polymer structure and the differences in lateral inter - subunit interactions are not taken into consideration .",
    "in addition , the microtubule assembly dynamics has been studied extensively by computer simulations .",
    "@xcite    recently , we introduced a set of simple stochastic models for the description of the growth of rigid biopolymers consisting of @xmath0 protofilaments , that explicitly includes the geometric structure and monomer - monomer lateral interactions.@xcite according to this approach , only few polymer configurations are relevant for the growth dynamics because of inhomogeneity in lateral interactions that comes from the geometry of polymer ends .",
    "these configurations are selected using the criteria that the distances between the protofilament tips in each configuration should be less than @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 is a polymer subunit length . for @xmath4 , in the so - called `` one - layer '' approximation , the mean growth velocity and a dispersion ( or a diffusion coefficient ) of polymer s length have been calculated exactly for any number of protofilaments and for the arbitrary geometry of biopolymer s growing end .",
    "the quality of the `` one - layer '' approximation has been discussed for the simple case of the growth of polymer made of two protofilaments , i.e. , @xmath5 , which is closely related to actin filaments . in this case , a full dynamic description that includes all possible polymer configurations provided exact expressions for the mean growth velocity .",
    "it was found that the predictions of the approximate model are approaching the exact results for large but realistic values of the lateral interactions .",
    "although the approach presented in ref.@xcite provided a very good description of experimental results of individual microtubule growth under external forces , and it suggested a reasonable way of coupling of the microscopic structure of the biopolymers with their dynamic properties , there are several theoretical problems with this method .",
    "first , the criteria that helps to determine the finite number of the most relevant configurations in `` @xmath6-layer '' approximations is introduced using an arbitrary cut - off distance , but it would be more desirable to derive it from more fundamental thermodynamic and kinetic arguments .",
    "second , the method used for calculating exactly the full dynamic model of the growth of two - stranded polymers allowed only the determination of the mean growth velocity , and not the dispersion .",
    "however , the simultaneous knowledge of the dispersion and the velocity is crucial for understanding the growth mechanisms of rigid biopolymers.@xcite the goal of this paper is to address these theoretical issues by studying the growth dynamics of two - stranded biopolymers with more detailed microscopic description .",
    "in addition , we will analyze the experimental observations on the growth of single actin filaments .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "the dynamics of the two - stranded polymers that can grow only from one end is discussed in section ii , while the description of the polymer growth from both ends is given in section iii .",
    "the application of the developed chemical kinetic models for the experiments on single actin filaments is presented in section iv .",
    "the results are discussed and summarized in section v. the mathematical details of calculations of dynamic properties are given in appendix .",
    "consider a growing rigid polymer that consists of two protofilaments .",
    "the polymer is attached to a nucleating site on a surface and may polymerize or depolymerize only from the free end , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . this is the attached two - stranded polymer .",
    "@xcite the building block of this polymer is a monomer subunit of length @xmath3 .",
    "the lateral offset between two parallel protofilaments is equal to @xmath7 and it can generally vary between 0 and @xmath3 . for actin filaments",
    "the monomer size is @xmath8 nm and the lateral shift is @xmath9 nm.@xcite    there are infinite number of possible polymer configurations that differ from each other by the geometry of the growing end and the total length of the polymer .",
    "for labeling these configurations we use a pair of integers that count the number of monomer subunits in each protofilament . without loss a generality ,",
    "let us choose a first ( bottom ) protofilament as a leading one in a configuration @xmath10 , where the distance between protofilament tips equal to @xmath7 : see fig .",
    "the second ( top ) protofilament will be the leading one in the configuration labeled as @xmath11 , where the distance between the tips is equal to @xmath12 . generally , as illustrated in fig .",
    "1 , for configurations @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , the distances between the parallel protofilaments are equal to @xmath15 and the first protofilament is the leading one , while for configurations @xmath16 the distances between protofilament tips are @xmath17 and the second protofilament is the leading one .    all dynamic transitions in the attached two - stranded polymers may be characterized by a set of four pairs of transition rates that depend on the local geometry of the growing end . as shown in fig .",
    "1 , the attachment and detachment rates from the leading protofilament for all polymer configurations are given by @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "transition rates @xmath20 and @xmath21 describe the polymerization and depolymerization events when the overall length of the polymer does not change .",
    "for example , as presented in fig .",
    "1 , the transitions between the configurations @xmath22 and @xmath23 are given by these rates , while in both configurations the polymer length is @xmath24 .",
    "a monomer can attach with the rate @xmath25 to the protofilament 2 of the configuration @xmath10 , or it can detach with the rate @xmath26 from the same protofilament of the configuration @xmath11 . similarly , the monomer subunit can associate with the rate @xmath27 to the protofilament 1 of the configuration @xmath11 , or it can dissociate with the rate @xmath28 from the same protofilament of the configuration @xmath23 : see fig .",
    "1 . note that the subscript indexes ( 0 , 1 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 ) are equal to the fractions of the lateral bond between the monomers on the parallel protofilaments created or broken in a given transition .",
    "the overall kinetic scheme of the system , that includes all possible states and transitions , is shown in fig .",
    "the polymer growth dynamics can be described by a set of master equations for each configuration .",
    "solutions of these equations , that characterize the steady - state growth dynamics of an attached two - stranded polymer , are outlined in a full detail in the appendix a. below we present only the final results for the mean growth velocity and dispersion .    within the full dynamic description ,",
    "the growth velocity appears formally as a sum of two terms , namely , @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 the parameter @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) is given by @xmath37    the expression for the diffusion coefficient is also consists of two terms , @xmath38 where the terms are given by the following expressions , @xmath39 and @xmath40.\\ ] ] the auxiliary function @xmath41 is defined as @xmath42    the dynamic properties of the growing polymer strongly depend on the lateral interactions between the parallel protofilaments .",
    "it can be seen from the fact that the transition rates for binding or unbinding the monomer subunit are directly related to a lateral interaction free energy per monomer @xmath43 via the detail balance conditions .",
    "it can be shown that@xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45    this observation is the basis for the approximate theoretical description of the growth of rigid biopolymers with @xmath0 filaments , the one - layer model , that we developed earlier.@xcite in this model , only polymer configurations with the distances between the protofilament tips less than the monomer length @xmath3 are considered .",
    "it allows then to calculate the mean growth velocity and dispersion explicitly .",
    "specifically , for @xmath5 it can be shown that @xmath46    since the full dynamic description of the growth of the attached two - stranded polymer is now available , the quality of the one - layer approximation can be easily checked in this case . as shown in fig .",
    "3 , the one - layer model describes the growth dynamics reasonably well for large lateral interactions . in the limit of infinite lateral interactions the predictions from the approximate",
    "theory become exact . however , the convergence of the approximate one - layer results to exact quantities strongly depends on the geometry of the growing polymer end , specifically , on the ratio between the lateral shift @xmath7 and the monomer length @xmath3 .",
    "the best description can be obtained for the symmetric case @xmath47 , while for other geometries this approximation is less successful .",
    "one of the advantages of the one - layer approximation is its ability to be easily extended to include more polymer configurations . as a better approximation ,",
    "it is natural to consider configurations where the distances between the protofilament tips do not exceed 2@xmath3 , i.e. , a two - layer model .",
    "the number of polymer configurations is still finite and the dynamic properties can be easily calculated following the approach presented for the one - layer approximation.@xcite in the two - layer approximation , for two - stranded polymers it can be shown that@xmath48 and @xmath49 where @xmath50,\\ ] ] with the parameter @xmath51 given by @xmath52 the results of the two - layer approximation for the mean growth velocity and dispersion are also presented in fig 3 .",
    "the agreement with exact full dynamic properties is very good even for weak lateral interactions ( @xmath53 ) , and the results do not depend much on the specific geometry of the growing polymer end .",
    "the multi - layer approach can be used to describe the growth dynamics of any rigid polymer consisting of @xmath0 parallel protofilaments .",
    "it is important to understand thermodynamic and kinetic justifications for this approximations .",
    "the fact that the growth dynamics for two - stranded polymers ( @xmath5 ) can be analyzed exactly is very useful to make the connection with @xmath6-layer approximate description .",
    "the kinetic schemes for full dynamic description and for the one - layer and two - layer approximations for two - stranded polymers are shown in fig .",
    "2 . comparing different kinetic diagrams , we can see that the one - layer approach corresponds to the main chemical pathway , while the two - layer approximation also takes into account the closest branched states .",
    "thus , the @xmath6-layer approximations can be thought of as a series expansion ( with @xmath6 terms ) of full dynamic description , where the value of energy of lateral interactions determines how good is the expansion .",
    "the higher the lateral interactions the smaller number of terms is needed in order to describe successfully the growth dynamics of rigid multi - filament polymers .",
    "now consider a two - stranded polymer that can freely grow from both ends . define @xmath54 and @xmath55 as time - dependent coordinates of",
    "the `` left '' and `` right '' ends of the polymer .",

    "the growth dynamics of the single actin filaments has been studied experimentally using the fluorescence microscopy with total internal reflection.@xcite the assembly of actin filaments was observed during the `` polymerization '' phase , i.e. at initial stages of the process , as well as the steady - state conditions , when the growing rate of the barbed end was compensated by the shortening at the pointed end .",
    "the main finding was that the kinetic rate constants estimated from the length change in the single actin filaments for the initial period differ considerably from that estimated using the length fluctuation analysis in the steady - state phase .",
    "the set of rate constants measured at the initial polymerization conditions mainly agrees with values obtained in other experimental studies,@xcite while the rate constants estimated from the measurements of length fluctuations at steady - state conditions were 30 - 45 times higher .",
    "several possible explanations for this discrepancy has been suggested.@xcite the first one is that the kinetic constants obtained in the steady - state phase may be intrinsically different from those obtained in the initial phase of polymerization .",
    "the change of nucleotide composition of the growing , or shortening tips in the time course of the process was indicated as a probable cause .",
    "the depolymerization velocity of adp - actin is known to be an order of magnitude higher than that of atp - actin at the barbed end .",
    "the second possible reason for the discrepancy in the rate constants may be due to the possibility that the `` effective '' size of polymerization - depolymerization unit may not necessarily correspond to a monomer .",
    "the authors speculate that one plausible way to eliminate this divergence is to set `` effective '' size of unit 5 - 6 times higher .",
    "however , this contradicts to widely accepted picture that the elementary step in the growth of actin filaments is adding or removing a single actin monomer.@xcite    in analyzing the experimental data on growth dynamics of single actin filaments the simplified phenomenological picture has been used.@xcite here , we investigate another possibility to explain the difference in the kinetic rate constants by using a chemical kinetic model with better description of polymer ends geometry and chemical interactions between monomers .    to estimate the parameters that describe the growth dynamics of actin filaments we note that @xmath47 , and , using the detailed balance conditions [ see eqs .",
    "( [ db],[gamma ] ) ] , the rate constants can be written in the following form @xmath66 coefficients @xmath67 and @xmath68 reflect the different values of activation energies for specific polymerization and depolymerization events .",
    "although the exact values of these parameters can not be measured experimentally , they might be estimated quite realistically as @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "it implies that the subunit attaches faster to the site where the stronger lateral contact is created .",
    "similarly , the detachment is slower if a stronger lateral bond should be broken .",
    "for simplicity , in our calculations we consider only the case @xmath71 and , as we checked , for other values of these parameters the results do not deviate much from the one presented here .    equations ( [ actin_rates ] ) imply that the growth dynamics of actin filaments can be described by using only 3 parameters : @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the parameters @xmath75 ( where @xmath76 is the concentration of free actin monomers in the solution ) and @xmath73 are the association and dissociation rates from the leading protofilaments , and @xmath74 is a measure of lateral interactions in actin filaments .",

    "however in the single - molecule experiments by fujiwara et al.@xcite the growth dynamics of each end separately has not been measured .",
    "nevertheless , for calculations we can use the data from other investigations where the polymerization dynamics at both ends has been characterized quantitatively in the similar experimental conditions.@xcite kinetics of actin polymerization for the barbed end can be described as @xmath79 with @xmath80 @xmath81m@xmath82s@xmath82 and @xmath83 s@xmath82 . comparing this phenomenological expression with the exact one",
    "( [ velocity ] ) ] allows us to estimate the parameters @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "here we also use the realistic estimate of energy of lateral interactions @xmath84",
    "@xmath85 @xcite that gives @xmath86 .",
    "these parameters are then applied to compute the contribution to the dispersion from the barbed end using eq .",
    "( [ dispersion ] ) .",
    "similar approach is utilized for the pointed end , for which the mean growth velocity can be described phenomenologically as @xmath87 with @xmath88 @xmath81m@xmath82s@xmath82 and @xmath89 s@xmath82.@xcite as a result , the overall dispersion of single actin filaments at steady - state concentration @xmath90 @xmath81 m can be estimated as @xmath91 @xmath81m@xmath92/min .",
    "it should be noted that this procedure depends weakly on the value of @xmath74 .",
    "also in these calculations we used the subunit length @xmath8 nm , and lateral off - set @xmath93 nm .    in the single actin filaments experiments@xcite the measurement of fluctuations at steady state conditions produced the dispersion of @xmath94 @xmath81m@xmath92/min , which is approximately 10 times larger than the value calculated above .",
    "the difference is significant and it implies that the chemical kinetic models with detailed description of polymer ends and monomer - monomer interactions still can not explain fully the experimentally observed fluctuations in growing actin filaments .",
    "however , our theoretical treatment does not take into account the hydrolysis of actin - atp monomers and related processes .",
    "it might be expected that these processes can significantly effect the growth dynamics of actin filaments .",
    "it is interesting to note that the dispersion for actin filament assembly ( with @xmath95 ) is a non - linear function of monomer s concentration , as shown in fig .",
    "4 . at high concentrations of actin monomers",
    "the dispersion is proportional to concentration , while for low concentrations there is a weak deviation from linearity .",
    "this dependence contrasts to the observed and calculated behavior of the mean growth velocity",
    ". it will be interesting to measure experimentally the concentration dependence of dispersion .",
    "we investigated theoretically the growth dynamics of two - stranded polymers where association and dissociation of monomers can take place from both ends .",
    "because the polymerization events at each end are independent from each other , we argued that the overall polymer elongation dynamics can be described as a combination of growth processes at each end separately .",
    "for attached rigid two - stranded polymers , that made of two protofilaments and can only elongate from one end , we developed a chemical kinetic model of the growth .",
    "this model takes into account the exact relative positions of two protofilaments and both lateral and longitudinal chemical interactions between the monomers . considering full dynamic chemical kinetic scheme ,",
    "the exact and explicit expressions for the mean growth velocity and dispersion have been derived in terms of rate constants of binding and unbinding of monomer subunits .",
    "because of the geometry of the polymer end and the monomer - monomer interactions , the growth properties of two - stranded polymers depend only on three parameters , namely , the rate constants of attaching or dissociating from the leading protofilament and the energy of lateral interactions .    the exact full dynamic description of the growth of two - stranded polymers , that accounts for all possible configurations , has been compared with a set of @xmath6-layer approximate models that consider only the most relevant polymer configurations .",
    "it was shown that the approximate approach is successful because it captures the main features of full dynamic kinetic diagram .",
    "in addition , the approximate description becomes better for larger lateral interactions between the monomer subunits .",
    "it has been concluded that @xmath6-layer approximations might be viewed as a series expansion of the full dynamic description of polymer growth dynamics .",
    "it implies that the approximate approach can be used to describe the growth dynamics of rigid biopolymers with many protofilaments , like microtubules or intermediate filaments .",
    "the full dynamic chemical kinetic model of the growth of two - stranded polymers has been applied to analyze the experimental observations on single actin filaments growth . using the kinetic rate parameters and the realistic estimate of the lateral interactions extracted from bulk chemical kinetic measurements of actin filaments",
    ", we calculated the overall dispersion in the length fluctuations of single actin filaments .",
    "the obtained value of the dispersion was approximately 10 times smaller than the experimentally observed.@xcite the difference is significant and it implies that other processes , not accounted by current theoretical analysis , contribute to the dispersion of the single actin filaments .",
    "it was argued that this discrepancy is due to the fact that the hydrolysis in the polymer molecule is not accounted in our theoretical approach .",
    "in addition , we also discussed the concentration dependence of dispersion .",
    "our theoretical calculations suggest that the dispersion of actin filaments depends weakly non - linearly at low concentrations of free monomers , and it approaches the linear dependence at large concentrations .",
    "it will be very important to measure the concentration dependence experimentally since it will give a valuable information on the mechanisms of growth and it will provide a direct check of the validity of our theoretical picture .    in a future , we plan to investigate the effect of hydrolysis of the monomers , associated with atp or its analogs , on the growth of biopolymers consisting of @xmath0 parallel rigid protofilaments .",
    "for actin filaments ( @xmath5 ) it seems reasonable to extend the current chemical kinetic model , however for biopolymers with larger number of protofilaments , such as microtubules and intermediate filaments , the coupling of hydrolysis with @xmath6-layer approximate approach , probably , is the most realistic approach .",
