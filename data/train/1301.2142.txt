    "@xcite however , the interaction between multiple cracks , driving a crack in an amorphous material , or a series of mode ii cracks such as a tribological interface  @xcite would be notoriously difficult to model with either approach . a classical interatomic potential that reproduces brittle fracture is therefor highly desirable .",
