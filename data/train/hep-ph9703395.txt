    "there have been a lot of discussions about whether perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) is applicable to exclusive processes at currently available experimental energies [ 1 - 12 ] . in the example of the pion and proton form factors , isgur and",
    "llewellyn smith @xcite noticed that in the energy region of a few gev the main contributions come from the end - point region @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is the fractional momentum carried by the parton ) where the running couple constant @xmath9 becomes large .",
    "thereby perturbation expansion might be illegal .",
    "recently this problem has been attacked and it is suggested that pqcd might be still applicable to the exclusive processes at currently experimental accessible regime of momentum transfer ( @xmath10 a few gev@xmath11 ) by using some techniques to cure the end - point problem [ 5 - 10 ] . huang and shen @xcite pointed out that the applicability of pqcd to the hadronic form factors is questionable only as momentum transfers being @xmath12gev@xmath11 by reanalyzing the contributions from the end - point region for the pion form factor .",
    "li and sterman @xcite proposed a modified perturbation expression for the pion form factor by taking into account the customarily neglected partonic transverse momentum as well as sudakov correction .",
    "they obtain a similar conclusion as @xcite : pqcd begins to be self - consistent at about @xmath13 .",
    "more recently , ji , pang , and szczepaniak @xcite pointed out that the usual factorization perturbation expression for the pion form factor is derived from the light - cone time - order perturbative expansion , and the natural variable to make a separation of perturbative contributions from contributions intrinsic to the bound - state wave function itself is the light - cone energy rather than the gluon virtuality of the hard scattering amplitude @xmath14 .",
    "they find that the  legal \" pqcd contribution defined by the light - cone energy cut becomes self - consistent at even much smaller @xmath3 region as compared to that defined by the gluon four - momentum square cut .",
    "nevertheless , we notice that although most of the recently calculations [ 5 - 12 ] show that perturbative qcd is self - consistent and applicable to the exclusive processes at currently experimental accessible energy regions , the numerical predictions for the pion form factor are much smaller than the experimental data .",
    "there are two possible explanations : one is that the non - perturbative contributions will dominate in this region ; the other is that the non - leading order contributions in perturbative expansions may be also important in this region . to make choice between the two possible explanations",
    "one needs to analyse the non - leading contributions which come from higher - twist effect , higher order in @xmath9 , and higher fock states _ etc . _",
    "field , gupta , otto , and chang @xcite pointed out that the contribution from the next - leading order in @xmath9 is about @xmath15 to the perturbative pion form factor . employing the modified factorization expression for the pion form factor proposed by li and sterman @xcite , refs . @xcite considered the transverse momentum effect in the wave function and found that the transverse momentum in the wave function play the role to suppress perturbative prediction .",
    "thus it is necessary to calculate the other non - leading contributions such as that from higher twist effect and higher fock states .",
    "one of the other sources which may provide non - leading perturbative contribution is the higher helicity components in the light - cone wave function @xcite .",
    "the effects from higher helicity components ( or wigner rotation effect ) have been investigated in the description of pion properties at high energies @xcite as well as at low energies [ 15,18 - 21 ] and the same effect has been also applied to explain the  proton spin crisis \" @xcite . however , the calculations for the contributions coming from higher helicity components to the pion form factor in the high energy region are conflicting in literatures @xcite . ma and",
    "huang @xcite pointed out that the higher helicity components provide a large _ enhancement _ for the perturbation prediction of the pion form factor and thus may provide the other fraction which is needed to fit the experimental data around @xmath16  gev@xmath11 .",
    "more recently , wang and kisslinger @xcite also analysed this effect based on the modified perturbative approach . in their approach",
    "this effect gives a large _ suppression _ for the pion form factor as compared to the prediction obtained in the original hard - scattering model in the @xmath3 domain where experimental data are available .",
    "thereby they concluded that non - perturbative contributions dominate in this region .",
    "@xcite and @xcite gave very different conclusions concerning the question whether the perturbative qcd contributions dominate or not in the available experimental energy region .",
    "we point out that the conflict between the above works is due to the difference between the hard - scattering amplitudes for the higher helicity components adopted in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is assumed in ref .",
    "@xcite that the hard - scattering amplitude for the higher helicity components is the same as that for the ordinary helicity component , t_h^(_1+_2=1)=t_h^(_1+_2=0 ) = .",
    "[ hsamh ] but the hard - scattering amplitude employed in ref .",
    "@xcite is t_h^(_1+_2=1)=-t_h^(_1+_2=0 ) = - - .",
    "[ hsakw ] it can be seen that the asymptotic ( @xmath17 ) behaviors of eqs .",
    "( [ hsamh ] ) and ( [ hsakw ] ) are with _ opposite _ signs .",
    "that is the reason that refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite gave _ opposite _ conclusions concerning the pqcd contributions from the higher helicity components in the experimental available @xmath3 region .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to analyze the effect from the higher - helicity components of the pion wave function in the light - cone perturbative qcd and address the conflict between refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite . we first review and analyze the spin structure for the pion light - cone wave function and the necessity to take into account the higher helicity components in sec .",
    "ii . then in sec .",
    "iii we calculate the hard - scattering amplitude for the higher helicity components of the pion form factor .",
    "we first explicitly show that the hard - scattering amplitude for the higher helicity components vanishes in the leading order @xmath18 as the parton intrinsic transverse momentum is taken into account , it is found that the asymptotic behavior of the hard - scattering amplitude for the higher helicity components is of order @xmath2 which differs from either eq .",
    "( [ hsamh ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ hsakw ] ) .",
    "we conclude that the higher helicity components , though provide vanishingly small contributions to the perturbative pion form factor in the asymptotic limit @xmath19 , they should be considered in the available experimental energy region since they are next - to - leading order contributions .",
    "iv is served as a summary .",
    "the light - cone ( lc ) formalism @xcite provides a convenient framework for the relativistic description of hadrons in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom , and the application of pqcd to exclusive processes has mainly been developed in this formalism ( light - cone pqcd ) @xcite .",
    "the essential feature of light - cone pqcd application to exclusive processes is that the amplitudes for these processes can be written as a convolution of hadron light - cone wave functions ( or quark distribution amplitudes ) for every hadron involved in the process with a hard - scattering amplitude @xmath14 .",
    "thus light - cone wave function is an essential part : it determines the distributions of the quark and gluons entering the short distance sub - processes and provides the link between the long - distance non - perturbative and short distance perturbative physics . in principle , light - cone wave function can be computed from rigorous light - cone qcd .",
    "unfortunately this task is very complex and difficult , and there is no exact solution up to now .",
    "more practical and more convenient way is to connect light - cone wave function with the instant - form wave function which can be obtained by solving the bethe - salpeter equation with some approximations @xcite .",
    "the connection for the spin space wave functions between the two formalisms are accomplished @xcite by the use of wigner rotation @xcite .",
    "the connection for the momentum space wave functions become possible with the help of some ansatz such as the brodsky - huang - lepage prescription @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that in order to connect the spin structures in two different frames correctly , it is necessary to consider wigner rotation effect .",
    "as it is known , spin is essentially a relativistic notion associated with the space - time symmetry of poincar .",
    "the conventional 3-vector spin * s * of a moving particle with finite mass @xmath20 and 4-momentum @xmath21 can be defined by transforming its pauli - lubnski 4-vector @xmath22 to its rest frame via a non - rotation lorentz boost @xmath23 which satisfies @xmath24 , by @xmath25 . under an arbitrary lorentz transformation ,",
    "a particle state with spin @xmath26 and 4-momentum @xmath21 will transform to the state with spin @xmath27 and 4-momentum @xmath28 , =r_(**,p)*s * ,   p=**p , where @xmath29 is a pure rotation known as wigner rotation . when a composite system is transformed from one frame to another one",
    ", the spin of each constituent will undergo a wigner rotation .",
    "these spin rotations are not necessarily the same since the constituents have different internal motion . in consequence ,",
    "the sum of the constituent s spin is not lorentz invariant .",
    "hence , although the pion has only @xmath1 spin components in the rest frame of the pion , it may have @xmath0 spin components in the infinite - momentum frame ( light - cone formalism ) , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the quark and anti - quark helicities respectively .",
    "one advantage of light - cone dynamics is that wigner rotation relating spin states in different frames is unity under a kinematic lorentz transformation .    to obtain light - cone spin space wave function of the pion one can transform the ordinary instant - form su(6 ) quark model spin space wave function of the pion into light - cone dynamics @xcite . in the pion rest frame",
    "@xmath32 , the instant - form spin space wave function of the pion is _ t=(_1^_2 ^ -_2^_1^)/ , [ spinor - inst ] in which @xmath33 are the two - component pauli spinors and @xmath34 , @xmath35 are 4-momenta for the two quarks respectively with @xmath36 . the instant - form spin states @xmath37 and the light - cone form spin states @xmath38 are related by a wigner rotation @xmath39 [ 15 - 21 ] , |j,_f=_s u_s^j |j , s_t . [ wigner - rotation ] this rotation is called as melosh rotation @xcite for spin-1/2 particles . applying transformation eq .",
    "( [ wigner - rotation ] ) on the both sides of eq .",
    "( [ spinor - inst ] ) one can obtain the spin space wave function of the pion in the infinite - momentum frame . transforming for the left side ( _ i.e. _ , the pion )",
    "is simple since wigner rotation is unity . for the right side ( _ i.e. _ , the two spin-1/2 partons ) , each particle instant - form and light - cone form spin states are related by the melosh transformation , ^(t)&=&w[(q^++m)^(f)-q^r^(f ) ] ; + ^(t)&=&w[(q^++m)^(f)+q^l^(f ) ] , [ melosh - rotation ] where @xmath40^{-1/2}$ ] , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",

    "notice that @xmath50 is also an eigen - state of the total spin operator @xmath52 in the light - cone formalism @xcite .",

    "the above result means that the light - cone spin of a composite particle is not directly the sum of its constituents light - cone spins but the sum of wigner rotated light - cone spins of the individual constituents .",
    "a natural consequence is that in light - cone formalism a hadron s helicity is not necessarily equal to the sum of the quark s helicities , _",
