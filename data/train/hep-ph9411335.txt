    "one property of the standard model which is still under active consideration is the origin of @xmath0 violation . up to now",
    "@xmath0-odd contributions have been observed only in the decays of @xmath2 mesons @xcite . in the decay one",
    "distinguishes two types of @xmath0 violation effects : direct @xmath0 violation occuring in the amplitudes ( described by @xmath4 ) and @xmath0-asymmetric terms in the mass matrix which is called indirect ( described by @xmath5 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath5 is precisely known (  @xmath6  ) , but there are still uncertainties concerning the value of @xmath4 .",
    "the cern experiment na31 found @xcite @xmath7 while the measurement of the fermilab experiment e731 is @xcite @xmath8 which is still consistent with the predictions of the superweak theory .",
    "thus it is still interesting to investigate other processes in order to find if direct @xmath0 violation is different from zero and providing another crucial test of the standard model .",
    "examples for such processes are b meson and rare @xmath2 meson decays , which are actively investigated both theoretically and experimentally . a promising decay channel is @xmath1 , where @xmath0 violation may be relatively large . the specific decay @xmath9 has been studied extensively and its status was recently reviewed @xcite .",
    "we study the time development of this decay channel starting with a pure @xmath2 beam and pose the question if one could identify a @xmath0-violating signal in the interference region .",
    "in particular , we are interested in a signature of direct @xmath0 violation which we present in this article",
    ". we will show that an experiment which studies the time development of @xmath2 decays and averages over the momenta of electron and positron is sensitive to @xmath0-violating terms .",
    "the new effect appears in the interference region of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 component and manifests itself as a time oscillation .",
    "the effect follows from general symmetry considerations as is explained in the next section .",
    "in addition , we present an estimate for the magnitude of the effect .",
    "this experiment is especially suited for laboratories with intense k beams like brookhaven @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we derive the formula describing the time evolution of a pure @xmath2 state and classify the different contributions . in section 3",
    "we discuss the calculations available for the amplitudes and their dependence on the parameters .",
    "furthermore we give the range of parameters , which is used later on in the numerical analysis . in section 4",
    "we present the numerical results for the time evolution of the @xmath2 state with special emphasis on @xmath0 violation in the interference region . finally , the reder who is interested on the experimental possibility can study section 2 and the conclusions in section 4 .",
    "the time evolution of a pure @xmath2 state is given in terms of the time development of the physical states @xmath11 and @xmath10 as follows @xmath12 .\\ ] ] the decay proceeds through two intermediate states , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , with the single or two photons converting into electron positron pairs .",
    "the decaying kaon has spin 0 , and angular momentum conservation demands the intermediate state @xmath15 to be in a p - wave .",
    "it follows , then , that the @xmath0 eigenvalue of @xmath15 is @xmath16 .",
    "thus @xmath17 can decay through the @xmath15 channel in terms of @xmath0-conserving parts , whereas @xmath18 decays through the @xmath0-violating parts of the hamiltonian .",
    "we denote these amplitudes as @xmath19 these would be the only two amplitudes if there were no higher order terms .",
    "in fact the decay of a @xmath2 can also proceed through the intermediate state @xmath20 , which is higher order in the electromagnetic coupling .",
    "this contribution to the decay width is not a priori negligible , because , as we will show , it has to be compared with @xmath0-violating terms which are suppressed . to be specific",
    ", the intermediate state of a pion and two photons has many partial waves so that both @xmath21 and @xmath22 states are allowed .",
    "thus the decay @xmath23 is @xmath0-conserving with the final state odd under the @xmath0 transformation .",
    "in fact the decay @xmath24 has already been observed .",
    "we define the relevant amplitude as @xmath25 the decay of a pure @xmath2 beam has the general form @xmath26 v(k_{+ } ) \\\\ & & \\hspace{1cm}+\\;e^{- i x_{s } t}\\;\\overline{u}(k_{- } ) \\slp_{k } \\big [ a_{1}^{+ } + \\epsilon ( b^{+ } + a_{2}^{+ } ) + \\epsilon b^{- } \\gamma_{5 } \\big ] v(k_{+ } ) \\big\\ } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath27 indicate that the spinors are written out explicitly , with @xmath28 being vector amplitudes and @xmath29 being the axial - vector . for explicit definitions",
    "see equations ( 12 ) , ( 17 ) and ( 24 ) .",
    "the term @xmath30 is small in comparison to @xmath31 on several resons :    * @xmath32 is small , being @xmath0-violating , * @xmath33 is small , being higher order in electromagnetism * these two small terms are multiplied by the small parameter @xmath5 .",
    "neglecting @xmath30 , the @xmath10 decays are @xmath0-conserving .",

    "the amplitude @xmath32 represents direct @xmath0 violation , whereas the violation in @xmath34 arises through the mass matrix .",

    "the first two show the typical exponential behavior for the decays , and the interference has an oscillatory term as well .",
    "we point out an important property of the interference term .",
    "the @xmath33 amplitude is odd under the @xmath0 transformation and thus antisymmetric under the exchange of the electron and positron energies or momenta .",
    "this is born out by explicit calculation , with equation ( [ gleichung3.2 ] ) being linear in @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath38 amplitude is even under exchange of the electron and positron momenta",
    ". therefore the term @xmath39 drops out in an experiment which symmetrizes over the electrons and positrons .",
    "the remaining interference terms in equation ( [ gleichung2.1 ] ) are @xmath0-odd .",
    "thus the presence of an oscillation in the interference region is a clear indication of @xmath0 violation . in the remaining article",
    "we estimate each of the amplitudes , we calculate the magnitude of the effect and demonstrate it with formulas and several figures .",
    "among the amplitudes , @xmath32 is the best known in the standard model . as discussed by several authors , the @xmath32-amplitude is calculated according to fig .",
    "[ eff - ham ] by means of an effective hamiltonian for @xmath40 semileptonic transitions derived by using the operator - product - expansion @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "one starts at a high energy scale , where the interaction is point - like , and scales down to low energies by means of the renormalization group equation .",
    "the procedure also includes electromagnetic and strong effects contained in the wilson coefficients .",
    "since the @xmath32-amplitude is @xmath0-violating , it involves the imaginary parts of the wilson coefficients , and the dominant terms are @xcite @xmath42 with @xmath43 these wilson coefficients receive their main contribution from energy scales between @xmath44 and @xmath45 where perturbative qcd is more reliable .",
    "the reduced matrix elements of the operators involve quark currents between hadronic states and can be related to @xmath46 decays through an isospin rotation @xcite . neglecting the mass of the electron ,",
    "the final form of the amplitude is @xmath47 v(k_{+})\\ ] ] with @xmath48 following the kobayashi maskawa parametrization for the quark mixing matrix we use for the coefficients the values @xcite @xmath49 with @xmath50 gev .",
    "the main uncertainty comes from the factor @xmath51 for which we will allow the range @xmath52 .",
    "the branching ratio from the @xmath32-amplitude alone is given by the formula @xmath53\\;\\frac{1}{2}\\ ;",

    "the amplitude @xmath31 has the same diagrams ( see fig .",
    "[ eff - ham ] ) as the amplitude @xmath32 .",
    "but the approach of using the same effective hamiltonian as in section [ directcpv ] involves the real parts of the wilson coefficients with large contributions from regions far below @xmath45 , where perturbative qcd is not reliable .",
    "for this reason one does not use the qcd effective hamiltonian , but resorts to other low energy methods like chiral perturbation theory .",

    "most of the factors here have standard definitions except for @xmath60 , which is the coupling constant of the octet of pseudoscalar mesons and @xmath61 , which is a dimensionless coupling constant . both have to be determined experimentally . from the decay",
    "@xmath62 it was found @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath61 was determined from a @xmath64-analysis of the spectrum for the decay @xmath65 , based on a calculation of the spectrum in @xmath66pt @xcite , including the same set of parameters . from their data",

    "in the same way as @xmath32 , the @xmath31-amplitude with the corresponding range of parameters will be used as an input for the time development of a pure @xmath2 beam .",
    "we have already mentioned that we should include the @xmath33 amplitude even though it is of o(@xmath71 ) . since the decay",
    "@xmath1 has not yet been observed it was suggested to study the intermediate decay @xmath72 , which has recently been observed , with the branching ratio @xcite @xmath73 starting from these studies , one should couple the two photons to the final electron - positron pair .",
    "this is useful but not very direct , because some amplitudes contributing to + @xmath74 are suppressed in the @xmath75 amplitude , being proportional to @xmath76 and their contribution being negligible .",
    "as will become clear later on , an amplitude which gives a significant contribution to the @xmath77-distribution gives a very small contribution to the semileptonic decay .",
    "the amplitude for the decay @xmath78 has been estimated by two different methods .",
    "one method uses a two - component model developed by sehgal and collaborators @xcite .",
    "the two contributions included are : ( @xmath79 ) a diagram with a charged pion loop to which the photons are attached and ( @xmath80 ) vector meson intermediate states .",
    "the second method applies chiral pertubation theory @xcite .",
    "the two approaches differ in several respects , but for the amplitude which is dominant in our investigation they agree .",
    "this comes about as follows : the decay @xmath81 has several amplitudes , but only one of them is significant for @xmath33 .",
    "it is fortunate that estimates of this amplitude give similar results in the two methods .",
    "we describe the results of the two - component model @xcite .",
    "the amplitude for @xmath82 has the general structure @xmath83 .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the pion - loop diagrams contribute only through the @xmath84 amplitude , whose contribution to @xmath33 is proportional to @xmath76 and thus small .",
    "this follows by considering the general structure of the loop integral and the tensor structure of the term that multiplies the @xmath84 amplitude in equation ( [ gleichung3.1 ] ) .",
    "the vector meson pole diagram contributes to the amplitude @xmath85 defined by @xmath86 conservation of @xmath0 demands that @xmath85 is an odd function of @xmath37 . defining + @xmath87 ,",
    "the absorptive part of @xmath85 is @xmath88 , \\nonumber \\\\ &",

    "\\label{gleichung3.2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we notice that @xmath89 is an odd function of @xmath37 and in addition the limit @xmath90 is justified for the decay @xmath75 . in this limit ,",
    "equation ( [ gleichung3.2 ] ) is in agreement with formula ( 28 ) of @xcite .",
    "the formula above has only one coupling @xmath91 which is chosen in such a way that it reproduces the branching ratio in equation ( [ gleichung3.3 ] ) .",
    "the dispersive part is calculated with the help of a dispersion relation @xcite @xmath92 where the lower limit is given by @xmath93^{-1}\\ ] ] and the upper limit is determined by the heaviest particle considered , this being the @xmath94 meson .",
    "the differential decay - width reads @xmath95 .\\ ] ] inserting the numerical values we obtain a branching ratio dominated by the vector meson coupling constant @xmath96    the second method for calculating the decay @xmath72 is chiral perturbation theory .",
    "the authors include effects of the order @xmath97 @xcite and @xmath98 @xcite in the momentum expansion of @xmath66pt , as well as vector mesons @xcite .",
    "this enables them to reproduce the observed decay rate and spectrum . in this approach",
    "there are again two effective coupling constants which have to be fixed experimentally . here",
    "the vector meson coupling constant was chosen in such a way so that the measured decay rate is reproduced .",
    "the calculation of the two - photon - exchange contribution to the decay @xmath9 on the basis of the @xmath66pt prediction is analogous .",
    "the branching ratio achieved in this manner is dominated by the vector meson intermediate state and reads @xmath99 with the same @xmath94 . in the numerical analysis of section [ numerik ]",
    "we can choose any of the two calculations for @xmath100 and @xmath101 momenta , this @xmath33 amplitude drops out in the interference region .",
    "with the amplitudes developed and the general equation ( [ gleichung2.1 ] ) we calculate the time evolution for the decay @xmath1 .",
    "as already discussed , there are three regions of physical interest .    * the @xmath10-region , where the @xmath0-conserving amplitude contributes to the decay width .",
    "a measurement in this region will determine parameters of the @xmath10-decay like @xmath61 .",
    "* the @xmath11-decay region , which has been studied in several articles interested in @xmath0 phenomena ( see the review @xcite ) . the relevant amplitude in this case is @xmath102 , which gives several terms .",
    "the interference term @xmath103 is odd in @xmath37 and one could define an asymmetry in @xmath37 in order to extract this term .",
    "the sum of the absolute values squared is even in @xmath37 , and we will need precise measurements of the amplitudes in order to observe an excess of events . *",
    "more interesting is the interference region occuring in the time interval @xmath104 .",
    "this term has an oscillatory behavior .",
    "the term @xmath105 is a linear function in @xmath37 and drops out when we average over the electron positron pair .",
    "the remaining terms @xmath106 and @xmath107 are both @xmath0-violating .",
    "thus the appearance of an oscillation in the interference region gives evidence for @xmath0 violation .",
    "+ we have studied this phenomena numerically and show the effect in several figures . fig .",
    "( 2 ) and fig . ( 3 ) show the branching ratio as a function of time for two different time scales .",
    "we note that an oscillation is evident .",
    "we use @xmath108 and three values for @xmath109 .",
    "we plotted the same curves in figures ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) where the @xmath0-violating terms @xmath106 and @xmath107 are set equal to zero .",
    "we noticed that the curves to be compared are different . in the interference region",
    "there is a clear oscillation and for very long times the curves which contain the @xmath0 amplitudes lie above the curve without the @xmath0-violating terms . for the latter region experiments studying @xmath11-decays",
    "need a precise measurement of magnitudes in order to establish a signal .",
    "the branching ratio is in the range @xmath110 .",
    "in contrast to this situation , the oscillation in the interference region is unambiguous .",
    "a comparison of the magnitudes of the contributing terms shows that @xmath106 dominates over @xmath107 . only if we choose @xmath61 at the upper bound ( @xmath111 ) the two contributions are of comparable size .",
    "but the direct @xmath0-violating term is still larger by @xmath112 for @xmath113 .",
    "we conclude that an experiment searching for a branching ratio down to @xmath114 and sensitive to the time development of the decay can observe @xmath0 violation as an oscillation in the interference region .",
