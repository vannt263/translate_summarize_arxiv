    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) are believed to be the most promising accelerators of ultrarelativistic particles ( electrons , protons and nuclei ) in our galaxy @xcite .",
    "they are responsible for the majority of cosmic rays ( crs ) with energies up to @xmath6 ( lorentz factor of proton @xmath7 ) .",
    "classical observations of synchrotron radiation from snrs , mainly in the radio band , give experimental confirmation of the presence of relativistic electrons in these cosmic objects @xcite .",
    "recently , the presence of ultrarelativistic electrons in snrs has been confirmed by optical , x - ray and soft @xmath0-ray observations @xcite .",
    "there are expected two main cr accelerators in snr .",
    "one of them is a young pulsar ( if there is any ) , i.e. , a spinning neutron star with a strong magnetic field .",
    "the second one is a strong shock wave as the result of an interaction of supernova ejecta with the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "it is the main object of our investigation .",
    "the theory of cr acceleration at the shock front via the first order fermi mechanism is quite well elaborated @xcite .",
    "its main prediction is a considerably higher efficiency of the proton acceleration in comparison with an electron case , i.e. , up to @xmath8 of kinetic energy of the incoming flow may be transformed into the energy of newly accelerated crs .",
    "experimental evidences of the proton acceleration at shock fronts are limited to the solar system region ( a bow shock at the boundary of the earth s magnetosphere , interplanetary shocks and solar flares ) .",
    "therefore , it is of great importance to find additional evidences of the proton and nucleus component acceleration at the fronts of cosmic shock waves .    such a new possibility is offered by the recent observations of considerable @xmath0-ray fluxes in directions on some radio bright snrs @xcite",
    ". among the 32 unidentified galactic plane @xmath0-ray sources detected by the energetic gamma - ray experimental telescope ( egret ) aboard the compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) five sources are coincident with snrs without known pulsars .",
    "four of these snrs ( w28 , w44 , @xmath0 cygni and ic  443 ) exhibit evidences of a strong interaction with interstellar clouds .",
    "therefore , it is believed that the observed @xmath0-ray emission is the result of an interaction of the accelerated by snr shock wave protons with the snr matter itself @xcite or with the matter of the adjacent molecular clouds @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we check this hypothesis for the case of well - studied snr ic  443 and show that according to the atypically low initial energy of a supernova explosion such simple explanations do not hold here . in order to explain the @xmath0-ray emission of ic  443 we elaborate a hydrodynamical model of ic  443 as a result of a supernova explosion in the medium with a large scale density gradient , what allows us to explain observational data concerning x - ray surface brightness distribution and obtain the parameters of remnants , especially shock wave characteristics ( section [ sect2_paperv ] ) . using these parameters , we consider in detail the snr shock interaction with a nearby molecular cloud ( section [ sect3_paperv ] ) and",
    "show that the reverse shock enhances the energy and number density of newly accelerated crs ( section [ sect4_paperv ] ) .",
    "then we show that caused by the rayleigh - taylor instability , effective mixing of snr and molecular cloud matter leads to the generation of an observable flux of @xmath0-rays ( section [ sect5_paperv ] ) .",
    "conclusions are given in section [ sect6_paperv ] .",
    "snr ic  443 is well studied at different energy bands from radio to @xmath0-rays @xcite ( figure  [ ic433_red ] and [ ic433_xrays ] ) .",
    "it is believed to be the result of a supernova explosion which happened about @xmath9 yr ago near a dense molecular cloud at the distance about @xmath10 kpc from us .",
    "its unusual nonspherical morphology should reflect the inhomogeneity of the surrounding ism , but until now a self - consistent model of ic  443 is absent .",
    "( 397,397 ) ( 0,0 )     +    we suppose that the main reason of this is the absence of a detailed numerical modelling of ic  443 .",
    "so , despite the evident influence of inhomogeneity of the surrounding ism , ic  443 models are mainly based on the use of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) self - similar sedov solution @xcite for snr evolved in a uniform medium . the role of the density gradient in the surrounding ism",
    "was taken into account only for the explanation of shape asymmetry within the framework of the approximate kompaneetz @xcite approach @xcite .",
    "therefore , we carry out here a detailed 2d calculation of the ic  443 evolution in a nonuniform medium using the proposed in @xcite new approximate method of a complete hydrodynamical description of a point - like explosion in an arbitrary nonuniform medium .",
    "besides geometrical sizes , we took the total flux and the surface brightness distribution in an x - ray band as free characteristics which give the best possibility for the estimation of plasma characteristics inside the snr .",
    "( 310,310 ) ( 0,0 )     +    taking into account the generally accepted distance to ic  443 @xmath11 kpc @xcite , we have reproduced the following picture of the supernova explosion . at @xmath5 yr ago , a sn explosion with the total energy @xmath12 erg took place in the transition zone between a warm ism with the hydrogen number density @xmath13 and an interstellar hi cloud with the number density @xmath14 and the high scale @xmath15 so the initial density distribution in this transition zone was @xmath16 with @xmath17 @xmath3 , @xmath18 @xmath3 , @xmath19 pc , the sn position moved on @xmath20 pc from the cloud centre and the initial hydrogen number density in the point of explosion @xmath2 @xmath21 calculations show the following best fitting parameters of the ic  443 model .",
    "depending on the direction from the explosion centre , the shock radius @xmath22 its velocity @xmath23 the postshock temperature @xmath24 and the initial hydrogen number density at shock front position vary in the ranges : @xmath25 ( pc ) @xmath26 @xmath27 ( km / s ) @xmath28 @xmath29 ( k ) @xmath30 @xmath31(r ) ( @xmath32 .",
    "the total swept up mass of the ism is @xmath33 masses of the sun ( @xmath34 ) , the volume of the disturbed by a shock wave region is @xmath35 @xmath36 , the mean snr radius is @xmath37 pc . in figure",
    "[ ic433_xrays_models ] the x - ray surface brightness of the ic  443 model is presented .",
    "the total equilibrium flux in an x - ray band is calculated for x - ray emissivity data from @xcite and is obtained to be @xmath38 kev)=1.4@xmath39 erg / s ( no absorption correction is made ) which corresponds to the experimental result @xmath40 kev)=1.5@xmath39 erg / s @xcite . in figure",
    "[ ic433_xrays_models](b ) we show the effect of the absorption of interstellar gas with the column density @xmath41 @xmath42 and an elongated cylindrical - like molecular cloud in front of the snr with the radius @xmath43 pc and the cloud column density @xmath44 @xmath45 the data for the absorption cross - section from @xcite were used .",
    "this absorption is mainly responsible for the unusual nonspherical x - ray shape of ic  443 .",
    "( 397,177 ) ( 0,0 )     +",
    "our calculations show that the visible x - ray shape of ic  443 is close to spherical , although with different radii in the south - west and the north - east , while the rosat x - ray image provides a strong evidence of two half - spheres in the ic  443 structure @xcite .",
    "this difference may be naturally explained by the enhanced absorption of x - rays in the adjacent to ic  443 elongated molecular cloud which is visible in a radio band @xcite .    the same molecular cloud ( or ,",
    "more correctly , the part of the cloud disturbed by the shock wave of snr ) should be responsible for the observable @xmath0-rays .",
    "observations in @xmath46 and @xmath47 emission radiolines @xcite reveal that the total mass disturbed by the shock gas in the molecular cloud reaches @xmath48 although this molecular cloud covers practically the entire remnant , the interaction region is localized in the southeastern part and coincides with the @xmath0-ray source position ( figure [ ic433_xrays ] ) .",
    "it means that the interaction region is somewhat displaced from the snr symmetry axis ( on the angle @xmath49 , as viewed from the supernova progenitor position ) , i.e. , ic  443 has essentially a 3d shape .    from the hydrodynamical point of view ,",
    "the snr  molecular cloud interaction is a complicated event accompanied by the arising of two shocks : a forward shock in the cloud matter and a reverse shock in the snr matter .",
    "the boundary between the ism and the molecular cloud becomes a contact discontinuity between the shocked plasmas of the snr and the cloud @xcite .",
    "according to the complexity of the resulting flow we can not calculate it within the framework of the used above method for one shock flow calculations .",
    "but simple analytical estimates are possible .",
    "so , the velocity of the forward shock wave in the molecular cloud @xmath50 is determined by the snr shock velocity @xmath51 at the cloud position and the ratio of hydrogen number densities of the molecular cloud @xmath52 and the ism @xmath53 @xcite : @xmath54 where @xmath55 depends on the number density contrast and @xmath56 for @xmath57 if a snr shock wave penetrates into the molecular cloud at the time @xmath58 yr after the sn explosion , when the shock radius is @xmath59 pc , @xmath60 km / s and , according to the sedov solution @xcite , the effective thickness of the postshock gas shell is @xmath61 the typical time scale of the reverse shock wave existence is @xmath62 the forward shock penetrates into the molecular cloud up to the distance @xmath63 and the shock - excited mass of the cloud is of order @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the molecular cloud density ( the typical number density of helium atoms @xmath66 is taken ) , @xmath67 is the proton mass , @xmath68 is the effective surface of the snr  cloud interaction .",
    "we note that the obtained mass of the shocked matter of the molecular cloud is close to the observed one , if we take typical values @xmath69 @xmath3 .    to summarise , the proposed here 3d model of ic  443 explains in a consistent way the main characteristics of the remnant , including its x - ray properties and interaction with the adjacent molecular cloud .",
    "we use this model for the estimation of the efficiency of cosmic ray acceleration and for the explanation of @xmath0-ray production in ic  443 .",
    "crs , i.e. , high energy relativistic particles ( electrons , protons , nuclei ) with the power - law energy spectrum @xmath70 and the mean energy density @xmath71 ev/@xmath72 erg/@xmath36 are believed to be accelerated by different mechanisms in our galaxy ( crs with energies @xmath73 ev ) and in powerfull extragalactic sources ( crs with energies @xmath74 ev , up to the maximal observable energies @xmath75 ev ) , such as active galactic nuclei , quasars , radiogalaxies etc . by now",
    "the most promising mechanism for the galactic cr generation is the first order fermi mechanism at shock wave fronts @xcite .",
    "in this mechanism fast particles gain energy during their diffusive motion in the shock region as a result of scattering on different types of magnetic field fluctuations ( magnetohydrodynamical waves , especially @xmath76 waves , turbulent pulsation etc . ) ahead and behind the shock front .",
    "the main reason for effective energy gain is the convergent character of hydrodynamical flows in the shock front frame .",
    "the main characteristics of a shock wave acceleration are the following @xcite .",
    "the acceleration time is @xmath77 where @xmath78 ( @xmath79 for upstream and 2 for downstream ) is the plasma velocity in the shock frame , @xmath80 is the diffusion coefficient , @xmath81 is the mean free path , @xmath82 is the larmor radius of a particle with the energy @xmath83 and the charge @xmath84 in the magnetic field @xmath85 @xmath86 is the light velocity , @xmath87 is the shock velocity in the observer s frame .",
    "parameter @xmath88 is believed to be in the range @xmath89 for snr shocks .",
    "the theoretically predicted spectrum of accelerated particles has the power - law type @xmath90 so @xmath91 for plasma with the adiabatic index @xmath92    both electrons and protons are involved in the acceleration process but the number of accelerated electrons is considerably less than the number of protons @xmath93 further we shall consider only a proton component of snr crs .",
    "there are different estimates of the efficiency of energy transformation from the kinetic energy of a hydrodynamical flow into the energy of accelerated particles @xcite .",
    "the reasonable result is that about 10% of the kinetic energy of a flow may be transformed at the shock front into the energy of crs.the maximal energy of crs is restricted by the processes of energy loss , particle escape from the region of acceleration , finite time of the shock existence etc . in the considered here snr ic  443 case , taking into account the calculated ic  443 shock characteristics , we should expect the following characteristics of cr acceleration .",
    "the total energy of cosmic rays in ic  443 is @xmath94 ( in order to provide the necessary amount of crs in our galaxy due to snrs we need @xmath95 ) .",
    "so , for our case @xmath1 erg we obtain @xmath96    for the spectral index of protons we take @xmath97 which is close to theoretical predictions ( [ spectum_of_cr ] ) and corresponds to the observable @xmath0-ray spectrum ( see below )",
    ". then the energy spectrum of ic  443 crs ( mainly protons ) is @xmath98    the process of the pion creation in subrelativistic proton  proton at rest collisions is effective beginning from the proton kinetic energy @xmath99 mev for which the pion decay dominates over other mechanisms of @xmath0-ray production @xcite .",
    "the same proton energy is needed to generate @xmath0-photons with the energy @xmath100 mev .",
    "the total number of such protons in ic  443 is @xmath101 the maximal energy of crs is restricted in the ic  443 case by the snr age @xmath5 yr .",
    "then , from @xmath102 we obtain @xmath103    the mean energy density of crs inside ic  443 with volume @xmath104 is @xmath105 exactly speaking , crs should not be uniformly distributed inside ic  443 .",
    "rather they will be concentrated in a thin shell of thickness @xmath106 @xmath107 near the shock front , where the majority of snr mass and about half of its thermal energy are concentrated @xcite , since the necessary time for diffusion on the distance of the order of a shock radius@xmath108 considerably exceeds the ic  443 age .",
    "it means that at least half of the total energy of crs @xmath109 is concentrated in this shell , so , the cr energy density near the shock front is @xmath110 as we shall see below , this value is too low for the generation of the necessary gamma - flux from ic  443 .",
    "therefore , we propose and consider in detail the promising mechanism of the cr energy density enhancement in ic  443 , connected with the reverse shock action .    in the reverse shock the plasma of snr",
    "is subjected to another shock and its final values of the number density @xmath111 and magnetic field @xmath112 are 2.5 times enhanced for @xmath113 plasma @xcite , which results in the increase of cr number density @xmath114 meantime the energy of individual ultrarelativistic particles increases according to adiabatic invariant conservation ( @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the normal to the magnetic field orientation component of particle s momentum ) @xmath117 .",
    "therefore , we expect that behind the reverse shock front the energy density of crs will be @xmath118 for our model we will have @xmath119 ev/@xmath120 .",
    "the maximal energy of crs in the reverse shock region will be of the order of maximal energy in the main shock , i.e. about @xmath121 ev , while acceleration conditions in the both shocks are similar .",
    "the @xmath0-ray flux from source 2eg  j0618 + 2234 which coincides with the snr ic  443 position is well approximated by the power - law dependence @xcite @xmath123 in the egret band @xmath124 gev .",
    "for the distance to ic  443 @xmath11 kpc the @xmath0-ray spectrum of the whole snr is @xmath125 the total @xmath0-ray luminosity in @xmath126 band is @xmath127 erg / s and the rate of photon creation is @xmath128 phot / s .    in @xcite it was shown that in the case of a pulsar absence , the most promising mechanism for @xmath129 @xmath0-ray production is inelastic interaction of relativistic protons with protons at rest resulting in the creation of pions and their consequent decay into @xmath0-rays .",
    "the @xmath0-ray luminosity in this case is equal to the rate of energy transformation from relativistic protons to neutral pions @xcite @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the mean number density of target nuclei in the region of interaction , @xmath132 mev is the minimal proton kinetic energy of the effective pion creation ( with the cross - section @xmath133 close to the mean value @xmath134 @xmath135 ) , @xmath136 is the mean energy transformed into the pion .    substituting in ( [ gamma_lum_ic443 ] ) the cosmic ray spectrum ( [ en_spectrum_cr_ic443 ] )",
    "we obtain : @xmath137 so , as it was mentioned earlier in @xcite , it is necessary to have the initial number density in the ic  443 region @xmath138 @xmath3 and the total energy of crs of @xmath139 ergs in order to explain the observable @xmath0-ray flux in such a simple model .",
    "but , as we showed in section [ sect2_paperv ] in the ic  443 case supernova exploded in a low density region with @xmath140 @xmath3 and the total energy of crs is expected to be only of the order of @xmath141 erg .    in @xcite , the @xmath0-flux from ic  443",
    "is explained as the result of the interaction of accelerated by snr crs with the matter of the adjacent molecular cloud .",
    "the role of the molecular cloud consists in the increase of the number density of target nuclei @xmath142 in the interaction region .",
    "namely , we can rewrite ( [ gamma_lum_theor ] ) in the form @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the total mass of the interacting with crs gas , @xmath145 is the proton mass .    in @xcite , this total mass is taken to be @xmath146 and the deduced mean cr energy density inside ic  443 is @xmath147 ev/@xmath120 .",
    "but , as we can see from ( [ mean_energy_dens_cr_ic443 ] ) , this value of @xmath148 is considerably higher than the one expected for ic  443 .",
    "another problem here is a high total mass of clouds @xmath149 in the region of interaction , while the cloud mass outside snr is included ( as we mentioned above , only @xmath150 of gas is inside the snr ) .",
    "the energy density of crs outside the snr should be considerably lower than that inside it @xcite , and , therefore , the pion production should be depressed .",
    "we suppose that the observable @xmath0-ray flux from ic  443 is caused by enhancement of the cr energy density in the reverse shock from the snr  molecular cloud interaction . indeed , using ( [ energy_dens_cr_ic443 ] ) we obtain from ( [ gamma_lum_theor2 ] ) the following @xmath0-ray luminosity in the case of enhancement of the cr energy density : @xmath151 therefore , we obtain the theoretical @xmath0-ray luminosity @xmath152 erg / s for ic  443 despite the low explosion energy @xmath1 erg and , accordingly , the low total energy of cosmic rays @xmath153 erg .    additional support for this model",
    "follows from the existence of an effective mixing mechanism of a hot containing cr plasma and dense shocked plasma of the molecular cloud  the well known rayleigh - taylor instability of a contact discontinuity between the both media which should lead to a decay of contact discontinuity and fragmentation of the shocked cloud material onto a set of cloudlets @xcite .",
    "another possibility of the effective cr  cloud material interaction takes place in the case of a strongly nonuniform cloud , in which dense molecular cores of mass @xmath154 and number density @xmath155 @xmath3 are embedded in a relatively less dense intercloud medium with the number density @xmath156 @xmath21 as a result of displacement of a contact discontinuity in the molecular cloud direction , such separate cores penetrate into the shocked by a reverse shock plasma region and should be the sites of an intense @xmath0-ray production .",
    "radio observations of the shocked molecular gas in the ic  443 region reveal the existence of few such cloudlets @xcite .",
    "if the association of some unidentified egret sources with snrs is confirmed , it will be a new argument for the cr acceleration in snrs .",
    "it is of great importance that contrary to a radio band , @xmath0-rays give unique information about the acceleration of a proton component of crs in snrs .",
    "in this work we have proposed a self - consistent model of ic  443 which explains a total set of its main parameters , including shape , size , x - ray and @xmath0-ray fluxes .",
    "we have shown that , despite the low supernova explosion energy , account for the snr  molecular cloud interaction , especially for the role of the reverse shock wave , is the main reason of an intense @xmath0-ray flux from ic  443 .",
    "further observational and theoretical efforts are needed for checking the theory of crs acceleration by snrs and ic  443 is a prominent candidate for such investigations .",
