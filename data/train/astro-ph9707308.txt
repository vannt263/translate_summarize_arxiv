    "the high velocity nature of pulsars has been recognized since the first , minimal sample was analyzed by gunn & ostriker ( 1970 ) . as pulsar discoveries and proper - motion measurements have increased , and the pulsar distance scale improved , the largest inferred velocity has increased to @xmath13 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the population s dispersion exceeds that of any other normal galactic stellar population .",
    "although it is likely that a pulsar s characteristic motion is generated during the neutron star formation , a number of physical mechanisms has been proposed . in broad terms , these include : ( 1 ) disruption of binaries through instantaneous , symmetric mass loss in supernova explosions ( blaauw 1961 ; gott , gunn & ostriker 1970 ; radhakrishnan & shukre 1985 ) ; ( 2 ) slow , post - explosion , rocket effects associated with loss of spin energy by the neutron stars ( e.g. harrison & tademaru 1975 ; helfand & tademaru 1977 ) ; and ( 3 ) an instantaneous momentum impulse , or `` kick '' , imparted through asymmetry of the supernova explosion ( shklovskii 1970 ; dewey & cordes 1987 ) .",
    "many statistical analyses of pulsar velocities have attempted to discern which ( if any ) of the mechanisms is favored ( dewey & cordes 1987 ; bailes 1989 ; iben & tutukov 1996 ) .",
    "the recent treatment by lyne & lorimer ( 1994 ; hereafter ll ) has incorporated new proper - motion measurements ( harrison 1993 ) and an up - to - date model for the free electron density in the galaxy ( taylor & cordes 1993 ; hereafter tc ) .",
    "the latter is essential for estimating distances to most pulsars .",
    "ll find a larger mean pulsar speed , @xmath14 450 km s@xmath4 , than had been estimated previously .",
    "the probability density function ( pdf ) for the perpendicular speed is @xmath15 where @xmath16 km s@xmath4 ( and @xmath17 ) .",
    "ll state that @xmath18% of pulsars will escape the galaxy , assuming an escape speed @xmath19 km s@xmath4 .",
    "ll also re - emphasized the fact that pulsar surveys tend to undercount the highest velocity pulsars .",
    "surveys are signal - to - noise limited and sample a finite volume which , of course , is roughly centered on the galactic plane . since it is generally thought that most pulsars are born in the vicinity of the galactic plane and move away from it ,",
    "fast objects spend less time in the detectable volume than slow ones and are consequently under - represented .    in attempting to characterize the pulsar velocity distribution",
    ", a fundamental difficulty is that _ all _ of the basic components necessary for a kinematic description of the population are poorly known . except for a few historical supernovae ,",
    "the _ chronological age _ of each individual object is unknown and it must be estimated from the `` spindown '' age .",
    "the _ distance _ is uncertain , though it may be constrained by a pulsar s dispersion measure ( dm ) from knowledge of the electron density within the galaxy .",
    "the perpendicular components of the _ velocity _ may be derived from the proper motion and distance , though the proper motion measurements only exist for a subset of the entire pulsar population and both distance and proper motion determinations have significant errors . in summary , there are significant uncertainties in the age , distance and velocity of nearly every known pulsar .",
    "our general goal is to infer properties , like the distribution of kick velocities at birth , for the pulsar population .",
    "since there is no _ a priori _ way to separate the uncertainties we must strive to treat them in an even - handed , consistent manner . although we do not completely fulfill that goal in this paper , we make significant progress by incorporating the uncertainties in position and velocity directly into our analysis and by separately considering the sensitivity of the results to the relation between spindown and chronological age .",
    "our major omission , which we plan to treat in the future , is the observational selection effects associated with the detection problem itself . in effect , the observer s selection function involves kinematic , geometric and detection - related pieces and we omit the last , focusing purely on the kinematic and geometric aspects .    in this paper",
    "we present a new analysis of pulsar velocities that ( 1 ) tests and exploits the hypothesis that pulsars are born in or near the plane of the galaxy ; ( 2 ) takes into account the uncertainties in pulsar distances and proper - motion measurements ; ( 3 ) estimates the full three dimensional velocity pdf and birth scale height of the known pulsars ; ( 4 ) uses the global information to sharpen the estimate of measured kinematic quantities and to infer the most likely values of other unmeasured quantities for each pulsar ; and ( 5 ) constrains the braking index and torque decay time for pulsar spindown .",
    "our methodology uses a likelihood analysis , augmented by a comparison of models with different complexity using bayesean odds ratios .",
    "this paper is the second paper in a series , where the first addressed the population of millisecond pulsars , finding them to be a low - velocity population with rms velocity @xmath20 ( cordes & chernoff 1997 ; hereafter paper i ) .    the first half of the paper deals directly with the statistical procedures we have developed and the application to the data . in  [ sec : pulsar ] we describe the selection criteria for the pulsar sample .",
    " [ sec : radial ] outlines and applies our procedure for constraining radial velocities and birth altitudes for individual objects . ",
    "[ sec : v3d ] derives a best fit three dimensional velocity distribution for the population and discuss the kinematic constraints on the braking index . ",
    "[ sec : veluno]-[sec : pulsars ] use the statistical results as an aid in estimating separate velocity components , birth z and ages for individual pulsars . using the estimated velocities we discuss in  [ sec : vb ] the velocity - magnetic moment correlation . ",
    "[ sec : psrsnr ] relates recent work on pulsar - supernova remnant associations to our analysis of the proper motion sample .",
    "the second half of the paper relates our work to a number of topics of current astrophysical interest . in ",
    "[ sec : astrophy ] we review the lines of evidence for asymmetric supernova kicks and derive the fraction of the observed sample that will escape the galaxy .",
    "we discuss the form of the velocity distribution function and give arguments that suggest that kicks @xmath21 occur and that a significant fraction of objects are moving so fast that _ only _ strong supernova kicks can explain their motion .",
    "we speculate about the relationship of the shape of the velocity distribution function to binary evolution scenarios .",
    "we discuss the implications for core collapse , drawing attention to the breaking of symmetry implied by the observed kick size .",
    "finally , we include a discussion of the search for the highest velocity objects in  [ sec : searching ] .",
    "we summarize our results in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "individual objects with idiosyncratic distance estimates or with extreme birth velocities or z altitudes are discussed in appendix  [ app : individuals ] .",
    "the observables we use to analyze pulsar space velocities are the spin period and its first time derivative ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) ; galactic coordinates ( @xmath24 ) ; the dispersion measure ( dm ) ; and the proper motions in the directions of right ascension and declination ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) and their associated measurement errors ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "we incorporate auxiliary information on particular lines of sight that includes the scattering measure ( sm ) and the locations of hii regions that may perturb distance estimates based on dm .",
    "the distance scale is based on the electron density model of tc , augmented by neutral hydrogen ( hi ) absorption measurements and other independent constraints on the distances , including 2 parallax measurements . in aggregate ,",
    "the available data provide a formal distance estimate and , for most objects , lower and upper bounds ( @xmath28 ) such as those presented by frail ( 1990 ) , frail & weisberg ( 1990 ) and koribalski ( 1995 ) based on hi absorption measurements , pulsar associations with supernova remnants , and parallax measurements .",
    "table  [ tab : psrdata ] lists the data that we have used , which results from the requirement that the spindown age ( @xmath29 for braking index @xmath30 and no torque decay ) be less than 10 myr and that the distance estimate include a lower and upper bound .",
    "a chronological age cutoff is necessary because we treat the orbital motion of the pulsar analytically by a taylor series approximation and this ceases to be accurate once significant changes in the acceleration have occurred .",
    "we focus on the _ vertical _ pulsar motion in our analysis ignoring all variations with galactocentric radius .",
    "we choose the age cutoff of 10 myr to guarantee that virtually all bound objects are still in the first quarter cycle of their oscillation perpendicular to the galactic plane .",
    "as we discuss in more detail below , the 10 myr age cutoff assures quite accurate vertical solutions in an infinite , planar galaxy .",
    "however , in 10 myr a @xmath31 km / s pulsar moves @xmath32 kpc , so the assumption of uniformity in the plane is nontrivial .    for each object the chronological age",
    "is based on @xmath22 , @xmath33 and a spindown model .",
    "it turns out that the models of greatest interest have @xmath34 and/or torque decay . for them ,",
    "the chronological age is less than @xmath29 so the imposed cutoff of 10 myr is more conservative than need be the case . even for @xmath35 , the maximum chronological age of 20 myr degrades but does not destroy the accuracy of the vertical solution .",
    "the age cut implies that our sample excludes millisecond pulsars and other pulsars that may have undergone accretion - driven spinup , a process that necessarily is slow and is therefore manifested in older objects .    of 96 objects with proper motion measurements ,",
    "47 satisfy our age and distance criteria .",
    "the 49 excluded objects include 45 that are older than 10 myr , of which 18 are older than 100 myr .",
    "an additional 4 objects were excluded because the tc distance model yielded only a lower bound on the distance and there was no auxiliary information to provide better constraints on the distance .",
    "the sample of 47 objects includes three with parallax measurements ( b0630 + 17 [ geminga ] , caraveo et al .",
    "1996 ; b0823 + 26 , gwinn 1986 ; and b2021 + 51 , campbell 1996 ) .",
    "we first derive constraints on the radial velocity and birth altitude , @xmath36 , from measurements of proper motion and distances on individual objects . in so doing ,",
    "we demonstrate that all pulsars with measured proper motions are consistent with birth near the galactic plane , @xmath37 kpc .",
    "this kind of analysis was first applied by helfand & tademaru ( 1977 ) to a sample of 12 objects .",
    "our conclusion about pulsar birth in the galactic disk is identical to that of helfand & tademaru .",
    "similarly , we find that the _ apparent _ motion of a few pulsars toward the galactic plane is due exclusively to projection effects .",
    "we extend previous analyses by taking into account errors on estimated distances and proper motions , acceleration in the galactic potential and alternative values for the braking index .    in the following ,",
    "we review the age uncertainty and describe a model which incorporates an arbitrary braking index and torque decay .",
    "we outline the geometric relations that exist between the estimated distance , proper - motion components , z - distance from the galactic plane , z - value at birth , radial velocity and pulsar age .",
    "we formulate a likelihood function for a quantity composed of possible z - values at birth and peculiar radial velocities today .",
    "we compare its value on a case - by - case basis to _ a priori _ expectations .",
    "the spindown age for an object with period @xmath22 and period derivative @xmath23 is defined as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the braking index .",
    "we have @xmath40 for braking by radiation from a point magnetic dipole of constant strength . if @xmath39 is a known constant , @xmath41 , and the initial period @xmath42 then the spindown age @xmath43 and the chronological age @xmath44 agree .",
    "measured braking indices are smaller than the dipole result : @xmath45 for psr b0540 - 69 ( boyd 1995 ) ; @xmath46 for the crab pulsar ( lyne , pritchard & smith 1988 ) ; and @xmath47 for psr b1509 - 58 ( manchester 1985 ; kaspi 1994 ) .",
    "most pulsars are much older than these objects and their braking indices can not be measured reliably because timing irregularities mask the contribution from the small expected second period derivative , @xmath48 .",
    "work below indicates that values of the braking index @xmath49 ( and no torque decay ) are less consistent with the kinematic data than are values @xmath50",
    "( and/or torque decays on a time scale of a few million years ) .",
    "since most of the pulsars in our sample are significantly older than those for which braking indices have been measured directly , these facts imply that braking indices are not constant and/or torque decay is significant over a pulsar s lifetime .    in principle , many physical effects can alter spindown from the static magnetic dipole limit .",
    "the strength of the magnetic field may change : ohmic decay ( ostriker and gunn 1969 ) and field growth ( e.g. by thermal effects , blandford , applegate and hernquist 1983 ) are both possible .",
    "particle emission processes may be more important than dipole radiation in angular momentum loss ( michel 1969 , goldreich and julian 1970 ) and the losses might scale differently with frequency and with magnetic field than dipole losses .",
    "the dipole geometry may change in time : some systematic changes in the relative orientation of the spin axis and the dipole axis were observationally inferred from the shape of pulsar beams ( lyne & manchester 1988 ) .",
    "the effective size of the dipole may change in time ( melatos 1997 ) .",
    "surface fields ( as opposed to the field at the light cylinder ) may be altered by mass accretion ( romani 1990 ) and crustal plate motion ( ruderman 1991 ) ; whether such changes influence the spindown rate is unclear .",
    "it is difficult to test these ideas directly since measurement of torque decay may be masked by other physical processes occurring inside the neutron star .",
    "some information is available .",
    "general observational indications are that pulsars that are or were members of binaries have weak fields of @xmath51 g that do not decay over lifetimes of @xmath52 yrs . in a number of recent , specific analyses involving accretion in binary systems field decay has been inferred to occur ( e.g. burderi , king & wynn 1996 ) .",
    "current statistical studies of pulsar properties do not find strong evidence for field decay in single pulsars ( e.g. van den heuvel 1993 ) nor for changes in the relative orientation of spin and dipole axes ( bhattacharya & van den heuvel 1991 ) .",
    "recently , wang ( 1997 ) has argued that an isolated pulsed x - ray source accreting from the interstellar medium must have undergone field decay from @xmath53 g to @xmath54 g in @xmath55 yrs ( by power law decay ) or @xmath56 yrs ( by exponential decay ) .    in view of the uncertainties ,",
    "we adopt a phenomenological approach and write @xmath57 , where @xmath44 is the chronological age and @xmath58 describes any time dependence of the torque law other than a pure power of the spin rate ( `` torque decay '' ) .",
    "most discussions on torque decay refer explicitly to exponential decay of the magnetic field for @xmath40 .",
    "then @xmath59 , and the quoted _ field _",
    "decay time is twice that of the torque decay .",
    "the notion of magnetic field decay has changed considerably since it was first introduced in discussions of pulsar evolution .",
    "ohmic decay in the neutron star crust was initially thought to be fast enough to account for the turn - off of radio emission from pulsars ( gunn & ostriker 1970 ) but it is now regarded as too slow to be relevant ( e.g. goldreich & reisenegger 1992 ) . for our uses , the phenomenological model applies for any @xmath60 but the relation between @xmath61 field and @xmath58 will vary .    for exponential torque decay , @xmath62 and the chronological age",
    "is given by ( bailes 1989 ) @xmath63      \\right \\}. \\label{eq : chrono}\\ ] ] if @xmath64 and @xmath65 , then @xmath66 .",
    "in other words , the spindown age and the chronological age agree when the torque decay has not taken place and when the initial period is short compared to the current period . on the other hand , if @xmath67 or if @xmath68 , then @xmath69 implying that the spindown age overestimates the chronological age .",
    "a braking index may be inferred from the instantaneous rate of change of frequency .",
    "the _ estimated _ braking index is @xmath70 for @xmath71 , @xmath72 but for @xmath73 and @xmath41 , @xmath74 .",
    "this sort of evolution would be consistent with both the small measured values of @xmath75 for very young pulsars and the larger kinematically inferred values of @xmath75 for older objects ( see below ,  [ sec : braking ] , where we discuss constraints on spindown laws ) .",
    "we adopt @xmath76 coordinates ( mihalas & binney 1981 , pp .",

    "the present - day , `` kinematic '' @xmath1 velocity of an object of age @xmath44 is @xmath87 and the birth z velocity is @xmath88 the taylor series expansion is accurate for pulsars younger than @xmath89 their z - oscillation period .",
    "figure  [ fig : vzmodel ] shows @xmath90 for pulsars with @xmath91 moving in a three - component model for the galactic potential ( paczynski 1990 ) .",
    "the very slowest pulsars ( e.g. @xmath92 ) , have asymptotic periods of 60 - 70 myr ( near the sun ) , while somewhat faster pulsars ( @xmath93 ) have periods @xmath94 myr . by restricting our analysis to objects with @xmath95 myr",
    ", we can safely assume that our expressions above accurately account for vertical acceleration .",
    "for example , with @xmath96 km s@xmath4 at 20 myr , the taylor series calculated velocity differs from the true current velocity by less than 3% despite changes of order 33% .",

    "bailes ( 1989 ) has suggested one scenario where a pair of nss are created from a binary .",
    "the binary evolves in such a way to produce one strong - field , high - velocity ns and one low - field , low - velocity ns .",
    "our interpretation and our statistical results on the kinematics of pulsars are consistent with this scenario but do not require the particular assumptions of his model .",
    "although we find no evidence of correlation between @xmath339 and @xmath61 , we do not regard that as particularly strong evidence for or against the role of neutrino - mediated parity violations or neutrino oscillations .",
    "the magnetic field required for these schemes is @xmath340 g , much larger than the inferred dipolar field today .",
    "thus , the original field must have decayed by @xmath341 and it is unclear what relationship today s residual field bears to the field that acted during the epoch of acceleration .",
    "frail , goss & whiteoak ( 1994 ) deduce a mean transverse velocity @xmath342 for 12 pulsars near supernova remnants , using the apparent angular offset between pulsar and remnant centroid , a distance estimate , and an age estimate , taken to be the conventional spindown age .",
    "one association in their sample ( b@xmath343 & g@xmath344 ) yields a transverse speed @xmath345 .",
    "a few others were excluded on the basis of their ` extreme ' velocities , ranging from 1600 to 3600 , including an association between psr b@xmath346 and kes 32 proposed by caraveo ( 1993 ) .    our constraints on kinematic pulsar ages (  [ sec : ages ] ) are based on objects that are much older than the characteristic 20 kyr age of those in the frail sample .",
    "if there is no field decay , the most likely braking index , @xmath347 , implies that the frail velocities are biased too low by about a factor of two . the mean transverse speed in the frail sample",
    "would then be @xmath348 , which is about 3 times higher than the mean transverse speed in our best - fit model 2.1 .",
    "if there is field decay on a timescale of @xmath349 myr and a braking index @xmath350 ( as in our best model ) , then the frail sample will have ages that are slightly _ larger _ than the conventional spindown times by a factor @xmath351 , thus reducing the mean , transverse velocity in frail by about 20% to @xmath352 , which is still larger than the transverse mean ( @xmath353 ) of our velocity distribution by 26% .    in either case",
    ", the velocities calculated from pulsar - supernova remnant associations are larger than the mean pulsar distribution .",
    "this is intriguing and may indicate that supernova remnants are produced preferentially by the explosions that yield fast kicks .",
    "it is clear that a statistical analysis of the significance of the pulsar - supernova remnant associations and a more complete analysis of the selection effects in the pulsar surveys are needed .",
    "for example , some of the higher velocity objects in the frail sample may be spurious associations . to gain some sense of the incompleteness of the pulsar survey at high velocity",
    ", we can assume that the 12 associations used by frail are real and estimate a correction to the pulsar birth rate for the selection against high - velocity objects in pulsar surveys as follows .",
    "frail estimate a median velocity @xmath352 that we correct to 380 ( using a braking index of 2.5 ) . from our velocity pdf based on 47 pulsars with average spindown age 2.95 myr , we find @xmath354 .",
    "assuming identical low velocity distributions , our sample is depleted of high velocity pulsars by a factor @xmath355 .",
    "for all velocities the sample has been depleted by a factor @xmath356 .",
    "thus , if the frail estimates are correct , then about 40% of pulsars are missed due to selection against high - velocities .",
    "in this section we discuss a few of the astrophysical implications of the results we have reached .",
    "the large peculiar velocities we have estimated for pulsars  and their distribution are the net result of kicks from supernova explosions , including rocket - like accelerations ( harrison & tademura 1975 ) , and disrupted orbital motion in those cases where a neutron star , or its progenitor , have become unbound from a binary or multiple star system .    a considerable body of evidence supports the conclusion that supernova explosions are , in general , asymmetric so as to impart significant velocities to neutron stars .",
    "this evidence includes ( 1 ) statistical arguments based on population synthesis studies which indicate that symmetric explosions yield too many binary radio pulsars and too small a mean speed ( dewey & cordes 1987 ; hereafter dc87 ) ; ( 2 ) the existence of objects , like the guitar nebula pulsar ( b2224 + 65 ) , which have velocities larger than that of any plausible progenitor binary ; ( 3 ) the occurrence of geodetic precession in two ns - ns binaries , which requires a misalignment of the spin and orbital angular momenta through explosion asymmetry ( cordes & wasserman 1984 ; weisberg 1989 ; cordes , wasserman & blaskiewicz 1990 ; arzoumanian 1996 ) suggestive of a kick @xmath357 ; ( 4 ) orbital precession in the pulsar j0045 - 7319 , probably the result of spin - orbit coupling ( lai 1995 ; kaspi 1996 ) . assuming aligned angular momenta in the pre - supernova state , kaspi infer a probable minimum kick of 100 to achieve the current misalignment of spin and orbital momenta .",
    "quantitatively , except for the guitar nebula pulsar , these facts each call for kicks @xmath358 . for example",
    ", dc87 concluded that @xmath359 kicks were needed to account for the then - observed @xmath94 pulsar velocity distribution and the low binary frequency of pulsars .",
    "current population synthesis models of neutron star containing binaries predict birth rates of wide and close radio pulsar binaries and of high mass x ray binaries in rough agreement with observations when kicks are drawn from a gaussian with dispersion @xmath360 ( portegies zwart & verbunt 1996 ) . without the kick , far too many be - pulsar binaries , be- and high - mass x - ray binaries and binary radio pulsars are found .",
    "it is important to note that the minimum kick needed to remove the wide binaries is less than that needed to explain the proper motions studied in this paper . also , the only direct measurement of very fast @xmath271 objects is that of the guitar nebula pulsar .",
    "indirect evidence comes from statistical studies of proper motion like the current one and that of lyne & lorimer ( 1994 ) .",
    "less clear evidence comes from associations of pulsars with some supernova remnants of known age ( see  [ sec : psrsnr ] ) .",
    "the current results extend previous results in a number of ways .",
    "we begin with the high velocity end of the pdf .",
    "the pulsar sample itself includes 5 examples ( 11 % ) whose inferred 3d velocities exceed 1000 km s@xmath4 .",
    "our model fitting allows us to estimate the fraction of objects that have sufficient total velocity to escape the galaxy .",
    "the escape velocity is , of course , not known with precision and it is a strong function of location in the galaxy .",
    "leonard & tremaine ( 1990 ) place a lower bound on the local @xmath361 of 430 km s@xmath4 .",
    "integrations of the paczynski potential also indicate that 500 km s@xmath4 is a representative estimate for @xmath361 , so we take this as a fiducial value .    in figure",
    "[ fig : pdf_cdf ] we show the pdfs for the peculiar speed and the cumulative distribution functions ( cdfs ) of speed for three models ( @xmath362 & 3.1 ) . the poorly - fitting , single - component model ( 1.1 ) suggests that 50% of the known , young pulsars will escape the galaxy .",
    "the best model ( 2.1 ) and slightly - worse model ( 3.1 ) yield a more modest @xmath363% .",
    "the cdf for pulsar speeds indicates 5 - 25 % above 1000 , taking into account uncertainties in our fitting , as indicated in figure  [ fig : pdf_cdf ] .    in interpreting these results ,",
    "it is necessary to reiterate that the pulsar sample is known to be strongly biased by selection effects , many of which arise from the fact that pulsar surveys are signal - to - noise limited .",
    "many factors contribute to the net s /",
    "n for a given pulsar , including period dependence of the underlying pulsar beam shapes and luminosity .",
    "more importantly , however , is the velocity selection that occurs ( helfand & tademaru 1977 ; cordes 1986 ; lorimer & lyne 1994 ) : a greater number of fast pulsars will move out of the detection volume centered on the earth than will move into it .",
    "thus , pulsar surveys are biased against high velocity pulsars .",
    "the magnitude of this bias depends on details of specific pulsar surveys .",
    "our analysis does not incorporate the detection - related part of the observer s selection function ( see introduction ) and it is not possible to correct _ post facto _ the derived pdf .",
    "we are currently working on incorporating the detection - related terms to the selection function ( chernoff & cordes 1997 ) .",
    "the velocity pdf derived by lyne & lorimer ( 1994 ) has an overall shape that is similar to our double gaussian model , but predicts a larger fraction of pulsars that will escape the galaxy , @xmath364 .      the two component distribution , model 2.1 , we have found to be the best fit in  [ sec : odds ] , may or may not correspond to two physical subcomponents in the galactic population of radio pulsars .",
    "our original assumption was that the sum - of - gaussians form would suffice to model any actual pdf , with no implication that the individual gaussians corresponded to distinct physical subpopulations .",
    "however , the fact that the three component model has an odds ratio inferior to the two component model and , in addition , that there is a significant disparity between the individual velocity parameters ( @xmath365 ) is suggestive that two distinct subpopulations may be involved . at the same time",
    ", we note that we have explored only gaussian models and that testing other parametric forms will be necessary before drawing this conclusion .    to test for the presence of an additional low - velocity population of pulsars , we explored solutions where two of the components were varied near our best fit for the two - component model ( 2.1 ) and a third additional component was imposed with dispersions in the range 10 @xmath366 210 . by varying the weights , @xmath367 , dispersions @xmath368 , @xmath259 while holding the birth scale height ( @xmath369 ) fixed , we find @xmath370 , @xmath371 , @xmath372 for @xmath373 , @xmath374 and @xmath375 , respectively .",
    "we therefore find no evidence in the data for a low - velocity component that might provide a signature of symmetric supernovae in isolated pulsars or in wide binaries .",
    "there is only a few percent allowed for pulsars with speeds less than 50 , consistent with the appearance of only two objects in our sample ( b1747@xmath29628 and b1929 + 10 ) whose 3d speeds could be , but need not be , this small .",
    "if there were no intrinsic kick then isolated supernovae would produce low velocity neutron stars with velocities of order their progenitors speeds , @xmath376 .",
    "the fraction of ns that originate from isolated ( nonbinary ) progenitors is not well known . in the models of portegies zwart & verbunt ( 1996 ) composed of 40% single stars , 60% binaries , with ll type kicks at birth ( models ss and ak ) approximately 34% of all supernova occur in isolated progenitors , 66% in binaries . since our model implies that there are relatively few low velocity pulsars , a natural interpretation is that all neutron stars receive a substantial kick at birth .",
    "this conclusion is at variance with the recent proposal of iben and tutukov ( 1996 ) that there are no intrinsic kicks during supernova collapse , that instead , the pulsar velocity is produced entirely by the breakup of binaries . to avoid overproducing low velocity pulsars , iben and tutukov posit that pulsars can arise only from stars in which mass transfer or tidal interactions function to spin up the star prior to collapse .",
    "comparison with the portegies zwart & verbunt results shows that this assumption is not sufficient to zero out the low velocity part of the pdf .",
    "roughly half of the supernovae in binaries involve mergers of stars prior to the explosion .",
    "we anticipate that the merged objects will resemble single stars in their center of mass motion but will contain substantial spin angular momentum . if these objects form neutron stars as the population synthesis models predict and if the neutron stars become visible pulsars but do not receive birth kicks then they will contribute weight to the low velocity part of the pdf .",
    "this is not what we observe .",
    "thus , whether or not single stars give rise to pulsars it appears that kicks @xmath21 are _ generally required _ for consistency with the pdf .",
    "a supernova kick of @xmath94 has generally been called for in population synthesis models ( dc87 ) : otherwise too many neutron star containing binaries are created .",
    "it is satisfying that the binary abundance gives results consistent with the low velocity end of the pulsar pdf .",
    "these abundances are an intrinsically less clear cut constraint because of the many complexities of binary evolution including the uncertainties implicit in the initial conditions .",
    "on the other hand , the small size of our current sample limits the precision of the direct determination of the pdf at low velocity .",
    "future proper motion measurements should improve the situation .",
    "recent searches for old , accreting , isolated neutron stars have turned up few prospects ( see wang 1996 for a review and manning , jeffries & willmore 1996 for limits on the rosat wide field camera survey ) .",
    "our results imply that fewer than 10% of neutron stars move with velocities less than 70 ( see above ) .",
    "this differs from the estimates of @xmath377% used by madau & blaes ( 1994 ) which were based on the young pulsar velocity distribution of narayan & ostriker ( 1990 ) , diffusively heated by gravitational interactions .",
    "since bondi - hoyle accretion scales as @xmath378 , the new velocity distribution should play an important role in determining the number of detected objects in x ray surveys and may help reconcile the paucity of sources and the theoretical predictions .",
    "the accretion rate onto the star depends also on the strength of the magnetic field and the rotation rate , so our estimates of the braking index and torque decay timescale are relevant too .    for supernovae in binaries that do not involve mergers ( roughly 30% ) the resultant velocity distribution represents a convolution of the orbital velocity distribution with the intrinsic kick velocity distribution .",
    "the maximum velocity attainable with @xmath379 kicks for initial masses up to @xmath380 was estimated by dc87 to be about @xmath381 ( by reaction [ n1 ] , with such a small separation that the supernova shock completely destroys the companion ) but this constituted @xmath382% of all formed neutron stars .",
    "a more significant @xmath383% contribution of @xmath19 was found in reaction [ n3 ] in which non - conservative evolution creates an unbound neutron star and white dwarf .",
    "these numbers are , of course , only examples based on the input quantities used by dc87 ; especially important is their attribution of final ( pre - explosion ) orbital periods after the spiral - in processes that influence the n1 and n3 paths ; these periods were only guessed at , implying that the typical 500 - 600 velocities estimated for these paths are not hard numbers .",
    "iben and tutukov ( 1996 ) argued that the highest orbital velocity of neutron star are created when the primary - descended neutron star in a binary is released as a consequence of a second supernova explosion .",
    "they envision a semi - detached binary consisting of a @xmath384 he core and an neutron star with a @xmath385 semi - major axis .",
    "the orbital velocity is @xmath386 and the first neutron star is ejected at @xmath387 . given that the initial mass of the main sequence progenitor of the he core is about @xmath388 , close to the maximum mass for a star to yield a neutron star , their example provides an upper bound to the possible orbital velocity .",
    "our result that 5 of the pulsars have velocities in excess of @xmath31 then provides decisive evidence that kicks of some sort are required .    in the future ,",
    "once the observational selection effects are more fully accounted for , it will be important to analyze the velocity pdf in detail . at the moment",
    ", we make a few general comments .",
    "an outstanding issue is whether the two gaussian description corresponds to a single distribution with an extended high velocity tail or whether it more closely corresponds to two separate populations of pulsars .",
    "our two component results imply low and high velocity pulsars with comparable numerical weights ( based on the crude estimate of the selection against high velocity pulsars above ) .",
    "if the contribution from the kick and from the orbital disruption of binaries were randomly combined ( in the sense of two random velocities drawn from individual gaussians ) then the resulting distribution would be unimodal in speed with a dispersion that is the root mean square of the individual dispersions .",
    "the current result is not unimodal .",
    "this may be an indication that the two known velocity sources , orbital motion and intrinsic supernova kick size , are correlated .",
    "for example , binaries in which super giants explode will generally be larger than those in which he cores explode ( since mass transfer has occurred in the second but not the first case ) .",
    "if the kick size of the former is smaller than the latter , then the pdf for velocity may have two distinct components .",
    "in fact , supernovae will occur in a variety of modified stellar types in binaries ( he core , co core , wolf - rayet and super giant according to portegies zwart & verbunt 1996 ) and more complicated correlations with orbital motion can be expected .",
    "another possibility is that the merged stars with no orbital motion but large angular momentum may experience kicks of a different characteristic size than regular or stripped stars . while all these possibilities are speculative , the accurate determination of the pdf , whether or not it is unimodal , promises to be of value in elucidating the complexities of binary evolution .",
    "an important aspect of this work is that we establish that a significant fraction of the pulsar velocity distribution lies above 1000 .",
    "this should provide important constraints on numerical simulations of supernova explosions .    in a supernova collapse",
    "the energy scales are @xmath389 ergs for neutrino emission and neutron star binding energy , @xmath390 ergs for mass motions plus optical display , and @xmath391 ergs for a 1.4 solar mass neutron star moving at 1000 .",
    "thus , the energy involved in ns motion is but a small fraction of the total .",
    "moreover , the ns velocity is quite small relative to free fall velocities in the vicinity of the core .",
    "it is interesting to note that the distance traveled by the core moving at a typical speed of @xmath31 for an interval corresponding to the delay before explosion ( 0.07 - 0.42 s for sn1987a as estimated by bethe 1993 ) is substantial compared to the characteristic dimensions of the system .",
    "bethe estimates three important lengthscales : the neutrinosphere where the optical depth to neutrinos becomes of order unity ( @xmath392 km ) , the gain radius where heating by the radiated neutrinos exceeds the gas cooling ( @xmath393 km ) and the free nucleon radius where alpha particles are completely dissociated into neutrons and protons ( @xmath394 km ) . as the protoneutron star forms",
    ", the accretion shock stands off at @xmath395 km and begins to accelerate outward once the ram pressure of the accreting material diminishes sufficiently .",
    "the neutrino heating and convection behind the shock are essential for providing the pressure that launches the shock .",
    "the core s motion is slow and the material between the neutron star and the shock is subsonic , so whatever acceleration mechanism functions , it should make little difference for estimating the state of the normal matter within the shock .",
    "we begin by describing the limits to the generation of core motion .",
    "if the kick @xmath396 is ultimately due to the momentum impulse associated with anisotropic neutrino emission , then a firm limit may be expressed in terms of the total binding energy of the neutron star , e.g. @xmath397 where @xmath398 is the anisotropy in the neutrino momentum and @xmath399 is the total energy emitted , which must be less than the binding energy of the final neutron star @xmath400 . to give kicks of @xmath401",
    ", we require that @xmath402 . from numerical simulations ,",
    "janka & mller estimate that the energy that is available is significantly less than the binding energy ",
    "more closely the accretion of the mantle during the convective period : @xmath403 .",
    "then a substantially larger asymmetry @xmath404 is required to give @xmath401 .",
    "this degree of asymmetry is inconsistent with simulations .",
    "if the kick is due to the momentum recoil from either accreted or expelled matter , the momentum transfer is of order the escape velocity near the gain radius times the mass contained between the gain region and the accretion shock front times an asymmetry factor , e.g. @xmath405 where @xmath406 is the anisotropy in the momentum carried off , @xmath407 is the mass and @xmath408 is the escape velocity . from numerical simulations ,",
    "janka & mller estimate from the most extreme cases that @xmath409 , @xmath410 and @xmath411 and infer @xmath412 .",
    "once again , a substantially larger asymmetry @xmath413 would be required to give @xmath401 .",
    "these general arguments are not without loopholes , of course .",
    "they depend on the validity of the existing numerical simulations to set reasonable limits for @xmath398 or @xmath406 . in all calculations",
    "to date the neutron star is fixed at the center of symmetry . as mentioned above , because the fastest neutron star motions are subsonic these approximations should be reasonable for gauging the size of purely hydrodynamic quantities like @xmath407 , @xmath399 , @xmath408 and @xmath406 that appear above .",
    "the fact that neutrino transport is treated with limited accuracy and that current numerical modeling is not done in full 3d are much more difficult issues to evaluate .",
    "as many others have discussed , it would appear that the likely physical sources for a kick are ( 1 ) the large neutrino flux beyond the neutrinosphere and ( 2 ) the outer envelope of infalling material which is not in sonic communication with the matter surrounding the core .",
    "goldreich , lai & sahrling ( 1997 ) have suggested that core g modes in presupernova stars may be overstable .",
    "as the matter collapses , irregularities in the infalling envelope may grow to large amplitude and ultimately impart a kick by gravitational torques . another possibility is envisioned by burrows and hayes ( 1996 ) in which the inhomogeneities of the infalling matter channel the supernova blast into a jet - like outflow that causes the core to recoil .",
    "it is important to point out , also , that the lack of correlation between the velocity and magnetic field in today s pulsars (  [ sec : vb ] ) does not necessarily rule out a neutrino - magnetic field interaction ultimately responsible for the recoil .",
    "if field decay has occurred , as suggested by our best fitting models with torque decay , then the correlation between magnetic field and velocity could be weakened .",
    "it is almost certain that the velocity pdf we have derived underestimates the fraction of pulsars with @xmath414 .",
    "searching for high velocity pulsars at high galactic latitudes is a clear , though nontrivial , way to improve the situation .",
    "the difficulty arises because ( 1 ) such pulsars will be faint owing to their presumably large distances ; ( 2 ) proper motion measurements will require vlbi techniques ; given pulsar faintness , the vlba will have to be augmented by the large - aperture arecibo telescope and green bank telescope ; ( 3 ) high - velocity pulsars will be above the thickest free electron layer in the galaxy and therefore their distances can not be estimated from the tc ( or any other ) model for the electron density .",
    "difficulties ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) can be surmounted through suitable allotment of telescope time .",
    "estimating pulsar distances is much more difficult to tackle , for inverting dispersion measures will never be possible for pulsars with @xmath415 kpc .",
    "parallax observations with vlbi or pulse - timing techniques are also unlikely .",
    "the only possible recourse is development of an alternative distance scale .",
    "we are investigating the possibility that radio pulsars have beam components whose luminosities are determined by @xmath22 and @xmath23 and no other parameters .",
    "this ` standard candle ' approach also requires that beam shapes and angular diameters also be predictable , in which case orientation angles between the pulsar spin and magnetic axes and the observer s direction can be determined , along with the predicted flux and , hence , distance .",
    "work on this beam modeling will be reported elsewhere .",
    "should beam modeling fail due to ( e.g. ) pulsar ` weather ' effects , such as severe distortions of magnetic fields from dipolar forms by accretion or other history dependent activity , then analysis of high latitude pulsars must rely on statistics of large numbers of objects rather than velocity estimates of individual objects .",
    "in this paper we have used the data on 47 pulsars to infer their velocity and z - altitude distributions at birth .",
    "our likelihood method allows estimation of radial as well as transverse velocities , contingent on estimates for the ages and birth z s of individual objects .",
    "we emphasize that we have not corrected the results for the strong selection effects in the original pulsar surveys that have provided the sample of objects .",
    "the strongest effect on our conclusions is that we have underestimated the fraction of pulsars with large velocities , e.g. those with @xmath416 .",
    "we are currently developing methods , similar to those in this paper and in paper i , that take selection effects into account .    with these provisos",
    ", we have found that :    1 .",
    "all pulsars in the sample are consistent with birth within 0.3 kpc of the galactic plane ; any apparent motion of pulsars toward the galactic plane is easily explainable as a combination of projection effects associated with pulsars that are relatively nearby , a conclusion made long ago , on a smaller sample , by helfand & tademaru ( 1977 ) .",
    "the best fit model we have found consists of two gaussian components in velocity , with dispersions @xmath230 and 700 , combined with a birth scale height of 0.13 kpc ; we have not investigated mathematical forms other than the multicomponent gausssians .",
    "3 .   with our fit",
    ", we predict that @xmath417 of pulsars like those in our sample will escape the galaxy ; a rough estimate indicates that this fraction may be underestimated by a factor @xmath263 due to selection effects .",
    "4 .   a braking index @xmath418",
    "is favored if the pulsar torque constant decays on a time scale @xmath11 myr .",
    "if no torque decay occurs , then most braking indices are in the range @xmath419-@xmath420 , though such a model yields a slightly inferior likelihood than does the model with torque decay .",
    "5 .   the constraints on braking index and torque decay time arise from the role that the kinematic age plays in our estimates of radial velocities .",
    "the most general statement is that pulsar ages are typically a factor @xmath263 smaller than the conventional spindown ages calculated as @xmath421 , which assumes birth at a period much smaller than the present day period and a braking index of 3 , with no torque decay .",
    "we find no significant correlation between velocity and magnetic field estimates . reconciling this result with previous studies is simple : previous work included strong field and weak field objects that had been spun up by accretion .",
    "we found in paper i that millisecond pulsars are generally a low velocity population .",
    "the correlation found in previous work appears to signify only the different evolutionary paths that have led to strong field objects and spun - up , low field objects .",
    "pulsar velocities require some sort of rocket mechanism that augments velocities that would obtain under the condition of symmetric supernovae in binary and nonbinary progenitors .",
    "no strong discrimination exists in our analysis for proposed rocket effects that take place during or shortly after supernova explosions .",
    "however , the estimated velocities require a more efficient acceleration mechanism than has been calculated thus far .",
    "we suggest that the best means for pushing the limits and testing models is to search for , and measure the proper motions of , pulsars at high galactic latitudes .",

    "<S> we use astrometric , distance and spindown data on pulsars to : ( 1 ) estimate three - dimensional velocity components , birth distances from the galactic plane , and ages of individual objects ; ( 2 ) determine the distribution of space velocities and the scale height of pulsar progenitors ; ( 3 ) test spindown laws for pulsars ; ( 4 ) test for correlations between space velocities and other pulsar parameters ; and ( 5 ) place empirical requirements on mechanisms than can produce high velocity neutron stars . </S>",
    "<S> our approach incorporates measurement errors , uncertainties in distances , deceleration in the galactic potential , and differential galactic rotation . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on a sample of proper motion measurements of young pulsars ( @xmath0 myr ) whose trajectories may be accurately and simply modeled . </S>",
    "<S> this sample of 47 pulsars excludes millisecond pulsars and other objects that may have undergone accretion - driven spinup .    </S>",
    "<S> we estimate velocity components and birth @xmath1 distance on a case - by - case basis assuming the actual age equals the conventional spindown age for a breaking index n=3 , no torque decay , and birth periods much shorter than present day periods . </S>",
    "<S> every sample member could have originated within 0.3 kpc of the galactic plane while still having reasonable present day peculiar radial velocities .    </S>",
    "<S> for the 47-object sample , the scale height of the progenitors is @xmath2 kpc and the three dimensional velocities are distributed in two components with characteristic speeds of @xmath3 km s@xmath4 and @xmath5 km s@xmath4 , representing @xmath6 and @xmath7 of the population , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the sample velocities are inconsistent with a single component gaussian model , well - described by a two component gaussian model but do not require models of additional complexity . from the best - fit distribution , we estimate that about 20% of the known pulsars will escape the galaxy , assuming an escape speed of 500 km s@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the best - fit , dual - component model , if augmented by an additional , low velocity ( @xmath8 km s@xmath4 ) component tolerates , at most , only a small extra contribution in number , less than 5% . the best three component models do not show a preference for filling in the probability distribution at speeds intermediate to 175 and 700 km s@xmath4 but are nearly degenerate with the best two component models . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate that the high velocity tail ( @xmath9 km s@xmath4 ) may be underrepresented by a factor @xmath10 owing to selection effects in pulsar surveys .    the estimates of scale height and velocity parameters are insensitive to the explicit relation of chronological and spindown ages . </S>",
    "<S> a further analysis starting from our inferred velocity distribution allows us to test spindown laws and age estimates . </S>",
    "<S> there exist comparably good descriptions of the data involving different combinations of braking index and torque decay timescale . </S>",
    "<S> we find a braking index of 2.5 is favored if torque decay occurs on a time scale of @xmath11 myr , while braking indices between 3.5 and 6 are preferred if there is no torque decay . for the sample as a whole , the most - probable chronological ages are typically smaller than conventional spindown ages by factors as large as two .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also searched for correlations between three - dimensional speeds of individual pulsars and combinations of spin period and period derivative . </S>",
    "<S> none appears to be significant . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that correlations identified previously between velocity and ( apparent ) magnetic moment reflect the different evolutionary paths taken by young , isolated ( nonbinary ) , high - field pulsars and older , low - field pulsars that have undergone accretion - driven spinup . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that any such correlation measures differences in spin and velocity selection in the _ evolution _ of the two populations and is not a measure of processes taking place in the core collapse that produces neutron stars in the first place .    </S>",
    "<S> we assess mechanisms for producing high - velocity neutron stars , including disruption of binary systems by symmetric supernovae and neutrino , baryonic or electromagnetic rocket effects during or shortly after the supernova . </S>",
    "<S> the largest velocities seen ( @xmath12 ) along with the paucity of low - velocity pulsars suggest that disruption of binaries by symmetric explosions is insufficient . </S>",
    "<S> rocket effects appear to be a necessary and general phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> the required kick amplitudes and the absence of a magnetic - field - velocity correlation do not yet rule out any of the rocket models . </S>",
    "<S> however , the required amplitudes suggest that the core collapse process in a supernova is highly dynamic and aspherical and that the impulse delivered to the neutron star is larger than existing simulations of core collapse have achieved .    02_-2 </S>"
