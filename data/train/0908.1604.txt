    "in quantum information science , information processing tasks such as quantum cryptography , dense coding , and teleportation can not only be implemented using two - dimensional qubits , but are sometimes more efficiently performed using @xmath0-dimensional qudits as carriers of information @xcite . in optical implementations , we can make use of the degrees of freedom of photons to define the qubits or qudits . while photon polarization is a two - dimensional degree of freedom , the spatial ( transverse momentum or angular momentum ) and spectral ( time - frequency ) degrees of freedom are intrinsically continuous and",
    "can be used to define arbitrarily dimensional qudits by appropriate discretization .",
    "for example , qudits can be defined by selecting a set of @xmath0 angular momentum eigenstates represented by gauss - laguerre modes @xcite .",
    "alternatively , multi - slits can be used to define @xmath0 transverse modes of the light field @xcite . in this case , all modes are essentially equivalent and an increase of @xmath0 by adding more slits is relatively easy .",
    "therefore , the method of using multi - slits to discretize the photons transverse momentum is very promising for the realization of qudits with higher dimensions .",
    "one of the challenges in realizing higher dimensional qudit systems is that the higher dimensional states require more precise and detailed measurements for analysis and control . for this purpose , it is useful to adapt the method of quantum state tomography to the specific qudit system @xcite . recently , we have presented a method of quantum state tomography for @xmath0-slit spatial qudits based on the spatial patterns obtained by scanning the position of photon detection in a plane between the focal and image planes of a lens @xcite . in this initial work",
    ", we demonstrated the method for double - slit qubits and pointed out that the extension to higher dimensions is straightforward .",
    "however , as the following results for triple - slit qutrits show , an increase of the slit number @xmath0 requires an increased spatial resolution to observe the theoretically predicted patterns .",
    "since such high spatial resolution is difficult to obtain , it is better to include the finite resolution of photon position detection in the method of quantum state tomography .",
    "it is then possible to obtain reliable results even though the measurement setup can not fully resolve the details of the interference patterns .    in this paper",
    ", we present the formalism for single scan tomography with finite spatial resolution and demonstrate it experimentally for the case of spatial qutrits . for this purpose",
    ", we describe the measurements in terms of realistic measurement operators including the resolution of the detection setup .",
    "the elements of these measurement operators then provide the actual pattern functions observed in the experiments .",
    "the quantum state is reconstructed by fitting the set of pattern functions to the detection distribution .",
    "the effect of finite resolution is clearly seen in the improvement of the fit achieved by using the realistic measurement operators instead of the theoretical infinite resolution interference patterns .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ th - a ] , we review the principle of single scan tomography and show how finite resolution can be represented by the measurement operator . in sec .",
    "[ th - b ] , we apply the method to two triple - slit qutrits measured by photon detection in a plane between the focal and image planes of a lens .",
    "we derive the pattern functions with and without finite resolution and illustrate the effects of finite resolution . in sec .",
    "[ ex1-a ] , we describe our experimental setup and present measurement results that demonstrate the entanglement of the qutrit pairs . in sec .",
    "[ ex1-b ] , we present and discuss the experimental results for single scan tomographies of spatial qutrit states prepared by conditional measurements on the other qutrit .",
    "the complete density matrix of the two qutrits is then reconstructed from a sufficiently large set of conditional measurements .",
    "[ conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "multi - dimensional spatial qudits can be defined by discretizing photon transverse momentum using multi - slits .",
    "if the quantum state of the photon passing through the @xmath1-th slit is given by @xmath2 , a @xmath0-slit generates a qudit described by the orthogonal basis @xmath3 . after the state of the photon",
    "is discretized by the slits , the photon propagates in continuous free space .",
    "the state of the spatial qudit can then be analyzed by measurements of photon position in this continuous space .",
    "specifically , the probability of detection at a point @xmath4 in any plane behind the @xmath0-slit is given by a measurement operator @xmath5 that acts on the @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space of the spatial qudit .",
    "for a qudit state given by a density matrix @xmath6 , the probability of detection is @xmath7 = \\sum_{i , j}{m}_{ij}(x)\\rho_{ji } \\ ; ,   \\label{tracerhom}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the matrix elements of the operators in the basis of the spatial qudit @xmath3 .",
    "thus the detection probability @xmath10 is a linear combination of the measurement operator elements with the coefficients given by the density matrix elements of the qudit state .",
    "if all of the pattern functions @xmath8 are linearly independent , it is possible to invert and solve the equation for the density matrix elements , so that the complete density matrix can be determined from the scanned distribution @xmath10 .",
    "this is the principle of single scan tomography .",
    "the measurement operator can be derived by projecting the operator @xmath11 describing the position measurement with outcome @xmath4 into the hilbert space of the spatial qudit .",
