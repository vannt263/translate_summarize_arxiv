    "neo thermal emission is only a weak function of an object s geometric albedo , unlike its visible light brightness , so a telescope surveying at ir wavelengths is essentially equally sensitive to low and high albedo objects @xcite .",

    "however , the 2003 report of the nasa neo science definition team @xcite opted not to consider a space - based ir system on the grounds that sufficiently large , high - operability long - wavelength focal plane arrays did not exist at the time . at the time , the largest long - wavelength ( @xmath6 m )",
    "hgcdte detectors designed for low - background astronomical background applications were in a 512x512 format , and their dark current and operability were inadequate for natural background - limited performance .",
    "nevertheless , the initial results of that pilot program lead by the university of rochester and teledyne imaging systems were encouraging @xcite .",
    "motivated by the possibility of discovering neos in thermal ir wavelengths with wise but aware of its limitations in terms of lifetime and field of view , our group revisited the space - based neo survey designs .",
    "the major advance that resulted in wise s improved sensitivity and spatial resolution over iras was the increase in its focal plane formats to 1024x1024 from 62 pixels , despite wise s smaller primary mirror ( 40 cm vs. 60 cm ) .",
    "moreover , the focal planes of the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "@xcite were predicted to equilibrate at @xmath130 k after the liquid helium was exhausted , a prediction that was borne out when the focal planes stabilized at 29 k after the cryogen ran out in 2008 @xcite .",

    "enough separation from the earth to minimize its heat load while still maintaining a nearly constant distance , thus supporting high - bandwidth communications , can be found at either of the earth - sun l1 or l2 lagrange points .",
    "while wise is constrained by its orbit and sunshade to viewing a narrow strip close to 90@xmath7 solar elongation , a mission at l1 with a taller sunshade can point much closer to the sun .",
    "the resulting mission concept , called the near - earth object camera ( neocam ) was first proposed to nasa s discovery program in 2005 and again in 2010 . in 2010 ,",
    "the project was awarded technology development funding to mature the long - wavelength ir hgcdte arrays .",
    "the results of that effort have produced new 10 @xmath0m - cutoff 1024@xmath8 arrays with very high pixel operability at 35 - 40 k @xcite .",
    "the mission design allows for long lifetime , high data transfer rates supporting downlink of full - frame images , and the ability to view large swaths of earth s orbit instantaneously . by enabling full - frame downlinks , standard astronomical data processing techniques for extracting sources and producing accurately calibrated astrometry and photometry",
    "can be employed .",
    "many objects are detected at or near the detection threshold , so the ability to extract faint sources and distinguish them from noise and artifacts is essential .",
    "with neowise , we have demonstrated the ability to extract sources down to signal - to - noise ( snr ) of 4.5 with extremely high reliability and completeness @xcite .",
    "similar science data processing techniques can be used for neocam .",
    "alternative orbits for carrying out an advanced neo survey have been considered .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite considered a venus - like orbit on the grounds that the shorter synodic period with respect to earth might afford more observations of neos with particularly earth - like orbits . in theory , such an orbit might allow neos to be discovered more rapidly than a system operating at l1 .",
    "however , a venus - like orbit takes a spacecraft @xmath130170 times further from the earth relative to l1 .    at present , ka - band ( the current state - of - the - art for spacecraft telecommunications systems , as demonstrated by the kepler mission ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can support @xmath1150 mbps downlink from l1 ; however , a spacecraft at venus incurs a factor of @xmath190030,000 drop in data rate relative to l1 .",
    "methods to radically increase data rates such as optical spacecraft communications systems have yet to be adopted for routine use by flight projects .",
    "the significant decrease in data rate from venus means that full - frame images can not be downlinked without lossy compression , increasing the difficulty of discovering neos at or near the sensitivity limit .",
    "while the  windowing \" method was used on the kepler mission to select only small groups of pixels around targets of interest , this technique requires a priori knowledge of the targets positions .",
    "however , when searching for new neos , target locations are not known .  windowing \" to reduce data volume for an neo survey therefore requires performing all source extractions on board the spacecraft .",
    "given limitations on memory and processor capacity , the ability to compute backgrounds and identify transient instrumental artifacts is greatly reduced .",
    "such techniques have not been demonstrated to produce calibrated sources at low snr . moreover , survey projects such as the wise and two - micron all - sky survey projects @xcite benefit substantially from the ability to reprocess science data using optimally estimated calibration products derived after the survey data were collected @xcite .",
    "if full - frame images are not collected , then reprocessing to apply best calibration products can not be carried out , leaving many potential detections lost and ruling out the possibility of improved photometry and astrometry .    a venus - trailing ir telescope , at 0.7 au from the sun ,",
    "is further stressed by the increased heat load on the thermal system , requiring active cooling for a cryogenic instrument whose focal planes must operate at @xmath135 k. the overall design and system complexity of a spacecraft that must now operate far from earth rather than remaining relatively nearby is increased .    to compare the asteroid detection capabilities of surveys operated from l1 and venus - trailing orbit , we have carried out detailed simulations of these two scenarios .",
    "two simulation approaches were taken .",
    "first , we performed a detailed simulation of a survey observing a * limited region of sky * over two years .",
    "this approach includes the creation of spatially static sources ( primarily stars and galaxies ) based on extrapolation of wise and _ spitzer _ data to neocam s predicted sensitivity limits as well as modification of the wise moving object processing system ( wmops ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to accommodate the cadence required to discover neos without the need for ground - based follow - up ( i.e. self - follow - up ) .",
    "the simulated near - earth asteroid ( nea ; near - earth comets were not included in this study ) population is based upon the latest estimates from neowise @xcite , with orbital elements taken from @xcite as implemented by @xcite .",
    "the second approach did not include static sources , but instead simulated a survey that covers * the entire viewable sky * over a six - year period .",
    "taken together , these two approaches allow new insights to be gained into the potential capabilities and optimization of a next - generation ir survey .",
    "both simulations follow this outline : 1 ) a frame - by - frame list of pointings for the survey is generated ; 2 ) mission parameters are input ( e.g. instrument fov including detector gaps , sensitivity , slew time , downlink time , etc . ) ; 3 ) a synthetic asteroid population that models expected numbers , orbital elements , and physical properties ( e.g. diameter , albedo , etc . )",
    "is generated ; 4 ) the predicted positions , infrared fluxes , and visible fluxes of each object in the population model are computed for each exposure in the simulated survey over six years using two thermal models ; 5 ) objects that are detected the requisite number of times at the appropriate cadence are tallied .",
    "the population model is generated by randomly drawing orbital elements from the @xcite model and assigning diameters and albedos randomly from the distributions given in @xcite for atens , apollos , and amors .",
    "the crucial difference between the limited - region and all - sky surveys ( other than the area covered ) is that in the limited - region simulation uses the modified wmops system to link detections together , allowing its efficacy to be evaluated .",
    "in this section , we describe the assumptions that were made for both the limited region and all - sky survey simulations .",
    "we assume that both l1 and venus - trailing missions employ similar instruments with identical performance characteristics ( i.e. telescope aperture size , detector performance , slew times , etc . ) .",
    "both instruments are assumed to cover the sky at the same rate , and both must obey the same restrictions on their cadence : that is , while each instrument has different viewing constraints owing to their different orbits , the sequence of observations in both position and time required to successfully discover neos is identical . even though there is a factor of @xmath1900 - 30,000 decrease in data rate for the venus - trailing mission compared to l1 ( necessitating complex on - board data processing and destructive data compression that will degrade performance ) , we nevertheless assume that data can be extracted and processed to the same sensitivity limits and with the same astrometric and photometric precision as the l1 mission . no penalty for lossy data compression was assumed .",

    "the cadence described here represents an initial result that could potentially be further optimized .",
    "a critical parameter in determining the success of the trial cadence tested for both surveys is the ability to compute reliable orbits from the simulated observations . to that end",
    ", we evaluated the orbits fit to a set of candidate tracklets resulting from both l1 and venus - trailing surveys .",
    "the determination of the success or failure of any asteroid observational cadence is relatively straightforward .",
    "objects must be linked with a high enough reliability and observed over an arc of sufficient length that the vast majority of the objects can be identified at subsequent appearances .",
    "orbit fits to a set of candidate tracklets resulting from both l1 and venus - trailing surveys using the standard , existing tools employed for real - time linking by the mpc were evaluated .",
    "the method is as follows : first , a visl  orbit is computed for each tracklet .",
    "the visl  method is useful for estimating an orbit from a short - arc set of observations spanning a day or two @xcite .",
    "the technique assumes that the object is at apsis at either the starting or ending observation , so that the object s instantaneous radial velocity is zero .",
    "it can provide a useful discriminator between main belt and nea orbits when very few observations are in hand .",
    "next , an attempt is made to find additional tracklets for that object by comparing residual positional differences between each orbit and tracklet pair ( noting magnitude and consistency of astrometric residuals ) .",
    "then , orbits are computed using gauss method ( or other methods such as those described in , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for linked tracklets .",
    "the process is repeated using a different starting orbit technique ( c.f .",
    "the assumed elements or generalized visl  techniques discussed in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at each step ,",
    "confirmed linkages result in tracklets being removed from the tracklet stack , further simplifying linkage attempts going forward .",
    "approximately 10,000 tracklets from the synthetic all - sky survey were evaluated in this fashion . in the procedure described above",
    ", all objects were treated as new and unidentified . in practice , this is an unrealistic assumption since the current mba catalog contains @xmath1500,000 objects with well - determined orbits . by the time a new space - based survey mission could be launched , even assuming construction started today , we expect the mba catalog to contain @xmath11 million objects with well - determined orbits , and the neo catalog could be expected to contain perhaps 15,000 - 20,000 objects . as a standard practice , the mpc runs all tracklets through procedures to check against known objects to remove in real time the easiest linkages to make .",
    "it is expected that @xmath330% of tracklets will be immediately identifiable , greatly simplifying the linking process .",
    "this result also serves as a warning that any dramatic increase in false tracklet generation rates will greatly complicate linking and thus reliability .",
    "it is imperative that the submitted tracklets be dominated by real objects .",
    "we have constructed a set of simulations that account for updated nea population models , including physical properties , orbital elements , and numbers .",
    "a portion of our model demonstrates the moving object pipeline s ability to extract and link tracklets in the presence of potentially confusing astrophysical sources as well as other asteroids that are not neas .",
    "we have successfully computed accurate orbits for the assumed trial survey cadence using the standard tools employed by the mpc .",
    "however , we note that the ability to compute orbits depends critically on excluding most false detections from the submitted tracklets .",
    "construction of a more complete catalog of potentially confusing non - neas such as mbas and jovian trojans is essential .",
    "we compared the performance of the venus - trailing and l1 surveys and found that the venus - trailing survey detects slightly fewer phas @xmath3140 m than the l1 survey , even assuming that no degradation results from the inability to downlink full - frame images . while the venus - trailing survey discovers more amors than the l1 survey , these objects are less likely to constitute impact hazards compared to atens and apollos , nor are they likely to be suitable targets for future missions .",
    "the l1 survey discovers more ieos , atens , and apollos than the venus - trailing survey .",
    "these results demonstrate that the cost , complexity , and risk associated with sending a survey telescope to a venus - trailing orbit is unwarranted . while neither survey is capable of fulfilling the 2005 congressional mandate to nasa to find 90% of all near - earth objects",
    "larger than 140 m in diameter by 2020 , an advanced space - based survey can make significant progress quickly .",
    "no asteroid survey has demonstrated the ability to detect neos at low snr and high reliability using only the equivalent of a spacecraft processor and memory to perform all source extraction algorithms .",
    "the loss of ancillary science and the ability to perform optimal image reprocessing with calibration products derived later in the mission associated with downlinking only regions of interest instead of full - frame images represents an additional penalty for interior - orbiting missions .",
    "these simulations serve as a starting point for optimizing the performance of an advanced survey aiming to largely characterize the hazard posed by neos , identify the best targets for future exploration , and deliver a high - quality dataset ripe for solar system science to the community .",
    "further improvements , such as those described above , can enhance the fidelity of the results .",

    "<S> estimates of the instrumental sensitivity , integration times , and slew speeds were included for both architectures assuming the properties of newly developed large - format 10 @xmath0 m hgcdte detector arrays capable of operating at @xmath135 k. our simulation included the creation of a preliminary version of a moving object processing pipeline suitable for operating on the trial cadence . </S>",

    "<S> trial orbits were computed for simulated position - time pairs extracted from the synthetic surveys to verify that the tested cadence would result in orbits suitable for recovering objects at a later time . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that the earth - sun l1 and venus - trailing surveys achieve similar levels of integral completeness for potentially hazardous asteroids larger than 140 m ; placing the telescope in an interior orbit does not yield an improvement in discovery rates . </S>",
