    "the spinless salpeter equation is a simple relativistic version of the schrdinger equation which can be obtained , with some approximations , from the bethe - salpeter equation @xcite .",
    "a covariant description of bound states of two particles is achieved with the bethe - salpeter equation @xcite .",
    "this equation reduces to the spinless salpeter equation @xcite when the following approximations are performed :    * elimination of any dependences on timelike variables ( which leads to the salpeter equation @xcite ) . *",
    "any references to the spin degrees of freedom of particles are neglected as well as negative energy solutions .",
    "the spinless salpeter equation takes the form ( @xmath4 ) @xmath5\\ , \\psi({\\bf r})=m\\ , \\psi({\\bf r}),\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the mass of the particle and @xmath7 is the mass of the eigenstate ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the binding energy ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 equals @xmath11 for a one - particle problem and equals @xmath12 for a two - particle ( identical ) problem ( in the center of mass frame ) .",
    "we restrict our attention to interactions which are introduced in the free equation through the substitution @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the time component of a relativistic four - vector .",
    "the interaction could also , in principle , be introduced through the substitution @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the spatial component of a relativistic four - vector .",
    "however we do not consider this kind of potentials since the derivation of the spinless salpeter equation from the bethe - salpeter equation leads to @xmath17 .",
    "equation ( [ eq1 ] ) is generally used when kinetic relativistic effects can not be neglected and when the particles under consideration are bosons or when the spin of the particles is neglected or is only taken into account via spin - dependent interactions . despite its apparent complexity , this equation is often preferred to the klein - gordon equation .",
    "the equation ( [ eq1 ] ) appears , for example , in mesons and baryons spectroscopy in the context of potential models ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "conversely to the schrdinger equation , for which a fairly large number of results , giving limits on the number of bound states or limits on the values of energy levels , can be found in the literature ( see for example @xcite ) , there are few general rigorous results concerning the spinless salpeter equation due to the pseudo - differential nature of the kinetic energy operator .",
    "most of these results have been obtained for a coulomb potential ( for example , upper and lower bounds on energy levels ) @xcite .",
    "recently upper and lower limits on energy levels have been obtained for some other particular interactions @xcite .",
    "some more general results also exist .",
    "an upper bound on the total number of bound states in three dimensions and an upper limit on the number of @xmath18-wave bound states have been obtained in refs .",
    "an upper limit on the critical value , @xmath19 , of the coupling constant ( strength ) , @xmath20 , of the central potential , @xmath21 , for which a first @xmath18-wave bound state appears has been derived in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this article",
    "we obtain lower bounds on the ground state energy , in one and three dimensions , for the spinless salpeter equation applicable to potentials for which the attractive parts are in @xmath0 for some @xmath1 ( @xmath2 or @xmath3 ) .",
    "these lower bounds yield lower limits on a second kind of critical value , @xmath22 , of the coupling constant , @xmath20 , of the potential , @xmath23 , for which the mass of the eigenstate @xmath7 is vanishing , entailing that for any value of @xmath20 greater than @xmath22 the system has an unphysical negative mass .",
    "in this section , we derive some general formulas that we apply in sections [ sec3 ] and [ sec4 ] to obtain the lower bounds in one and three dimensions .",
    "we begin by recalling the expression of the sharp young s inequality obtained in 1975 by beckner and independently by brascamp and lieb @xcite @xmath24^n\\ , ||f||_p\\ , ||g||_q\\ , ||h||_r,\\ ] ] where @xmath25 with @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) are best possible and take the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "now we write the spinless salpeter equation ( [ eq1 ] ) as an integral equation @xmath32\\ , \\psi({\\bf y}),\\ ] ] where @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the green s function of the kinetic energy operator , @xmath36^{1/2}$ ] , in @xmath37 dimensions . for @xmath38",
    "the expression of the green s function is known @xcite ( see also section [ sec3 ] ) .",
    "for @xmath2 the green s function is obtained in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "the young s inequality ( [ eq2 ] ) can be used together with the expression ( [ eq5 ] ) of the spinless salpeter equation to obtain @xmath39 is the attractive ( negative ) part of the potential . in order to obtain a formula without any reference to the wave function , we choose @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 . with the help of hlder s inequality applied to @xmath43 , it is possible to write @xmath44 .",
    "we obviously suppose for now that @xmath45 exists for some @xmath46 .",
    "this question is discussed in sections [ sec3 ] and [ sec4 ] .",
    "the quantity @xmath47 exists provided the attractive part of the potential is in @xmath0 for some @xmath48 .    from ( [ eq7 ] )",
    "we finally obtain the following lower limits    [ eq8 ] @xmath49 ^ 2=q^{1/q}\\ , \\left(\\frac{q-1}{q}\\right)^{(q-1)/q}\\ , \\left(\\frac{2q}{3q-2}\\right)^{(3q-2)/2q}\\ , \\left(\\frac{2-q}{2q}\\right)^{(2-q)/2q}.\\ ] ]    physically @xmath7 is required to be nonnegative and the quantity @xmath50 could be replaced by the mass itself , @xmath7 , provided that we restrict the right - hand side of ( [ eq8a ] ) to be nonnegative .",
    "equation ( [ eq8 ] ) is the main result of this article . in the next sections we apply this relation to obtain lower bounds in one and three dimensions .",
    "in order to apply the relation ( [ eq8 ] ) in the specific case of a three - dimensional space we need the relevant green s function .",
    "the computation has already been done in @xcite .",
    "the green s function is obtained by computing the following integral @xmath51 we find the following expression @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a modified bessel s function ( see for example @xcite ) . with the expression ( [ eq11 ] ) for the green s function we can compute the needed norms .",
    "we find that @xmath54 these relations , ( [ eq12 ] ) and ( [ eq13 ] ) , imply that we can not consider the ultrarelativistic regime ( @xmath55 ) in order to have finite values for the various norms of the green s function .",
    "moreover , since the bessel s function @xmath56 behaves like @xmath57 for @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) , we have the following restriction on @xmath27 in order to have a finite value of the constant @xmath60 @xmath61    the lower bound on the mass of the ground state is ( we suppose @xmath7 to be nonnegative ) @xmath62 this lower limit is nontrivial only if @xmath47 exists . the restriction ( [ eq14 ] )",
    "implies that the negative part of the potential must be in @xmath63 for some @xmath64 .",
    "note that the limit @xmath65 of the inequality ( [ eq15 ] ) gives @xmath66 which is trivially true .",
    "the inequality ( [ eq15 ] ) obviously yields the following lower bound on the ground state binding energy @xmath67 this lower limit implies that the binding energy does not increase , in modulus , faster than linearly with the mass of the particle and with the strength of the potential ( for the class of potentials we consider ) .",
    "we propose now to test the lower bound ( [ eq15 ] ) with some typical potentials .",
    "for simplicity we consider only central potentials .",
    "we use three potentials for these tests : an exponential potential @xmath68 an exponential multiplied by a power @xmath69 and a singular potential @xmath70    note that the lower bound ( [ eq15 ] ) does not apply to the yukawa potential , for example , since it behaves as @xmath71 near the origin and thus the negative part of this potential is not in @xmath63 for any @xmath64 .",
    "the mass of the ground state depends on two dimensionless parameters , @xmath20 and @xmath72 .",
    "it is thus rather cumbersome to compare the lower bound ( [ eq15 ] ) to the exact result .",
    "we propose an indirect test of this lower bound by computing a lower bound on the critical value , @xmath22 , of the potential , @xmath21 , for which the mass @xmath7 of the ground state is vanishing , entailing that for any value of @xmath20 greater than @xmath22 the system has an unphysical negative mass . from ( [ eq15 ] ) we obtain the lower limit @xmath73^{-1}.\\ ] ] this inequality depends only on one parameter , @xmath74 , and can then be tested more easily .    in figure",
    "[ fig1 ] , we present a comparison between the exact values of the critical coupling constant , @xmath22 , obtained numerically , and the lower limit ( [ eq16d ] ) as a function of @xmath72 for the three potentials ( [ eq16a])-([eq16c ] ) . note that for these tests we choose to solve the spinless salpeter equation with two identical particles , @xmath75 , only for numerical convenience ( not to modify numerical codes ) .",
    "clearly the lower bound ( [ eq16d ] ) is quite cogent and follow closely the exact behavior for all values of @xmath74 .",
    "the accuracy is , however , less good for the singular potential .",
    ", obtained numerically and the lower limit ( [ eq16d ] ) as a function of @xmath72 for the three potentials ( [ eq16a ] ) , ( [ eq16b ] ) and ( [ eq16c ] ) , denoted respectively e , pe and s.,width=453 ]",
    "in this section we consider confining potentials , such as the harmonic potential , for which the norm @xmath47 does not exist .",
    "then the lower bound ( [ eq15 ] ) does not apply without suitable modifications .",
    "this kind of potential is used , for example , in mesons and baryons spectroscopy , in the framework of potential models , to describe quark confinement together with the spinless salpeter equation @xcite .    to obtain a lower bound for this class of potentials we consider the following truncated potential @xmath76 defined as @xmath77 since @xmath76 is more attractive than @xmath78 , a lower bound on the ground state energy of @xmath76 is also a lower bound on the ground state energy of @xmath78 . to be able to compute the relevant norm of the interaction we consider the potential @xmath79 .",
    "now the lower bound ( [ eq15 ] ) applies to @xmath80 and we have @xmath81 denotes the mass of the ground state of the potential @xmath80 and where we consider , for a moment , the general form of the lower bound with the modulus of @xmath82 .",
    "the relation between the potentials , @xmath76 and @xmath80 , clearly implies that @xmath83 however we do not have a relation between @xmath84 and @xmath85 and we must restrict the lower bound ( [ eq16 g ] ) to nonnegative values of @xmath82 , which is secured if @xmath86 .",
    "this restriction implies a limitation on the possible values of the constant @xmath87 which can not be too large .",
    "we can then write @xmath88    we have two parameters , @xmath27 and @xmath87 , that can be used to maximize the right - hand side of ( [ eq16i ] ) with the restrictions @xmath89 and @xmath86 .",
    "actually the best optimization is obtained by searching the value @xmath90 of @xmath27 which yields the greatest value @xmath91 of @xmath87 such that @xmath92 . in other words",
    "we search for the value @xmath90 of @xmath27 which yields the greatest value @xmath91 of @xmath87 such that @xmath93 this procedure yields the lower bound , @xmath94 once @xmath91 has been found .",
    "note that the limit @xmath65 of the inequality ( [ eq16k ] ) yields @xmath95 which is trivially true .",
    "( in gev ) of the ground state of the logarithmic potential ( [ eq16l ] ) and the lower bound ( [ eq16k ] ) as a function of @xmath72 for three values of @xmath20 .",
    "1 gev has been added to the masses for @xmath96 and 1 gev has been subtracted from the masses for @xmath97 ( to obtain a clearer presentation).,width=453 ]    we propose to test this lower bound with a central logarithmic potential @xmath98 quigg and rosner introduced this potential in 1977 to describe the spectrum of heavy mesons @xcite .",
    "the values of the parameters they found was @xmath99 gev@xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "note that these values of the parameters were obtained with the schrdinger equation and not with the spinless salpeter equation .    in figure [ fig2 ]",
    "we present a comparison between the exact values of the mass of the ground state of the logarithmic potential ( [ eq16l ] ) and the lower bound ( [ eq16k ] ) as a function of @xmath72 for three values of @xmath96 , @xmath102 , @xmath12 .",
    "more precisely we fix @xmath103 to @xmath104 gev@xmath100 and we let @xmath6 vary between @xmath105 gev and @xmath106 gev , which covers approximatively the various constituent ( effective ) masses of the quarks used in potential models ( from the @xmath107 and @xmath108 quarks to the @xmath109 quark ) .",
    "we here also choose to solve numerically the spinless salpeter equation with two identical particles , @xmath75 . again",

    "to conclude this article we derive the lower bound applicable to one - dimensional space . again , in order to apply the relation ( [ eq8 ] ) , we need the relevant green s function .",
    "it is obtained by computing the following integral @xmath110 we find the following expression for the green s function @xmath111 where @xmath53 is again a modified bessel s function . with the expression ( [ eq18 ] ) for the green s function , we obtain @xmath112 these relations , ( [ eq19 ] ) and ( [ eq20 ] ) , imply that we can not consider the ultrarelativistic regime ( @xmath55 ) in order to have finite values for the various norms of the green s function .",
    "the bessel s function @xmath113 is characterized by a logarithmic singularity for @xmath58 and the constant @xmath114 is well defined for @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "the lower bound on the ground state energy is , where @xmath7 is supposed to be nonnegative , @xmath117 this lower limit is nontrivial only if @xmath47 exists .",
