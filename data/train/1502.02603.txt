    "a large number of mpcs can be synthesized @xcite and geometrically arranged in large areas at low cost @xcite , which is important from the technological point of view . in particular , the photoconductivity of mpcs has been studied intensively with the purpose of increasing the electrical conductivity of devices based on these molecules @xcite .",
    "the improvement of the organic semiconductor devices relies on the quality of the metal - organic interfaces @xcite , in particular , on the efficiency of charge injection and on the mobility of the charge carriers @xcite .",
    "for example , there is a charge transfer shift of the electronic levels at the cupc / au interface in the early stages of cupc deposition on au @xcite , and new occupied molecular states are created @xcite .",
    "the replacement of the m atom as well as the substitution of h by f ( fluorinated mpc ) alters the gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital @xcite , the latter resulting in n - type conduction , in contrast to the p - type behavior of the standard mpcs @xcite .",
    "the charge transport through the molecule can be measured directly @xcite or indirectly by photo - induced electron transfer @xcite , time resolved microwave conductivity @xcite , and scanning tunneling microscopy @xcite .",
    "cupc has been contacted with au atomic chains on nial substrate by nazin et al .",
    "@xcite , who observed a shift and splitting of the molecular orbitals as well as modifications of the electrode orbitals by scanning tunneling microscopy .",
    "field - effect transistors and metal - insulator - semiconductor diodes have been used to study the transport through cupc for different leads such as ca , au , and f@xmath1tcnq / au , demonstrating both electron or hole transport with a strong dependence on the geometry of the molecule - metal contact @xcite .",
    "cupc sandwiched between two semi - infinite au electrodes has been investigated theoretically in refs .",
    "the transmission coefficient , @xmath2 , shows two peaks near the fermi energy ( @xmath3 ) which have been dissected in terms of molecular orbitals .",
    "the electronic states of cupc hardly change when leads are attached .    on the other hand ,",
    "the landauer approach and green s function formalism have been used to address the quantum transport in mpc structures .",
    "mpcs with m @xmath4 mn , fe , co , ni , cu and zn sandwiched between semi - infinite armchair single - wall carbon nanotubes ( swnt ) have been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite using the smeagol package @xcite . within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga )",
    "it has been concluded that fepc and mnpc can be used as spin filters , and that the spin filter efficiency increases when n - doped graphene nanoribbons are used as leads for fepc @xcite . to overcome the weak interaction between au contacts and mpcs ,",

    "the transport properties of such aus - mpc - sau ( m @xmath4 cu , mn ) systems have been studied by the want code , with the result that electronic correlations are likely to be irrelevant @xcite . additionally , the authors have concluded that cupc is a molecular conductor , and mnpc a spin filter .    in this article",
    "we extend previous works on aus - mpc - sau and aus - f@xmath0mpc - sau junctions by including spin polarization , and by considering a variety of different metals ( m @xmath4 sc , ti , v , cr , mn , fe , co , ni , cu , zn and ag ) .",

    "the wave functions are expanded in atomic orbitals with an energy cutoff of 300 ry @xcite .",
    "we use a double zeta plus polarization basis .",
    "test calculations show no significant change when a single zeta basis is used for the m atom ; however , when a single zeta basis set is used for the whole structure , the results are clearly of inferior quality .",
    "the nuclei and core electrons are represented by troullier - martins pseudopotentials @xcite .",
    "we employ the local density approximation with coulomb interaction ( lda+@xmath5 ) .",
    "the on - site coulomb interaction , @xmath5 , is applied to the d orbitals on the central metal ions .",
    "forces below 0.04 ev /   are achieved in the structural optimization of mpc , using the conjugate gradient method . since for metallic chains a peierls gap is expected around the fermi energy , we do not relax the structure after attaching the leads to the molecule @xcite .",
    "we use the first two of the five - au - atom leads , respectively , to calculate the surface green s function , while the other three , closer to the molecule , are assumed to be part of what is usually called `` scattering region '' .",
    "the au - au distance is chosen to be 2.89   @xcite , and the interface distance between mpc and au is set to 1.37    @xcite .",
    "the structure of the devices is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . as a general remark",
    ", we note that the mulliken analysis shows a considerable charge redistribution due to the leads ( au atoms ) , mainly involving the m atom , and the n and c atoms close to the central atom and at the contact between leads and molecule .",
    "the electronic and magnetic properties of _ isolated _ mpc and f@xmath0mpc molecules have been studied before @xcite , where it was found that the magnetic moment ( mm ) is carried mainly by the metal atom .",
    "below we will compare , in particular , isolated molecules with molecules connected to leads , with emphasis on the differences .",
    "in addition , since the central atom is a transition metal , we will encounter all possible d orbital occupations , which often give rise to considerable correlation effects .",
    "thus it will be important to also investigate , not only for a few selected cases but systematically , the effect of a local coulomb interaction on the electronic structure as well as on transport properties . in this context , we note that @xmath5 often is considered to be a parameter , to be determined by comparing specific physical quantities , such as the band gap or the magnetic moment , with experiment .",
    "however , the value obtained for @xmath5 in such a way depends on the quantity considered . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath5 can in principle be computed by constrained density functional theory .",
    "both approaches appear not to be useful for the present systematic study where the system properties are strongly modified by the coupling to the leads .",
    "thus our concept is to vary @xmath5 systematically , within a reasonable range ( from @xmath6 to 8 ev , i.e. , from weak to strong correlation ) in order to elucidate the interaction - dependent trends in the changes of the system properties . for this goal",
    ", it appears sufficient to rely on the three values 0 , 4 , and 8 ev .",
    "[ table1 ]    the calculated magnetic moments are summarized in table [ table1 ] .",
    "we first discuss the total mms for the aus - mpc - sau system . for m = sc",
    "the mm differs slightly from that of the isolated molecule ( @xmath7 ) , and there is no effect of the @xmath5 parameter , whereas the mm of the m @xmath4 ti system is higher than for the isolated molecule ( @xmath8 ) , inceasing with @xmath5 . apparently the d - d electron interaction of ti enhances the charge transfer from the gold chain to the molecule when correlation increase . for v and cr",
    "the mm for @xmath6 is smaller than that of the isolated molecule ( @xmath9 for vpc , @xmath8 for crpc ) .",
    "as @xmath5 increases from @xmath10 to @xmath11 ev , the mms get closer to the isolated molecule value . for mn junctions the mm",
    "is mainly located on mn ( @xmath12 for plain mnpc ) and hardly depends on @xmath5 .    for the fe case",
    ", the magnetic moment of isolated fepc happens to be close to @xmath13 , but is found to be strongly increased in the junction due to the overlap between au orbitals and molecular orbitals , the mm on fe being roughly doubled .",
    "apparently this coupling induces a transition from a low - spin to a high - spin state , unlike the case of , e.g. , mn which is already in a high - spin state for isolated mnpc ; cf .",
    "@xcite , tables i and ii .",
    "thus fe is an exceptional example where the coupling to the leads have a pronounced effect on the magnetic properties .",
    "unfortunately , it seems not to be possible to explain this surprizing fact in terms of the standard picture of atomic d orbitals in a square planar crystal field ( see also below ) .    for the last five columns in the table , co @xmath14 ag",
    ", we note , first of all , that the total mm of the respective isolated molecules are close to 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , @xmath7 , respectively @xcite .",
    "thus it is apparent that the coupling to the leads has a significant effect in all cases for mpc , while the disturbance due to the leads is rather small for the fluorinated counterparts ( considering first @xmath6 ) . for both , mpc and fluorinated mpc",
    ", we find a considerable correlation dependence for co and ni .",
    "however , due to the strong coupling to the leads for mpc , this dependence can not straightforwardly explained by the electronic configurations of the respective isolated metal atoms . on the other hand , there is hardly any @xmath5-dependence for cu , zn and ag ( filled @xmath15 shells ) .",
    "table [ table1 ] also shows that the magnetic moment on the central metal atom in most cases differs considerably from the total magnetic moment .",
    "the @xmath5-dependence of the metal magnetic moment generally is small , except for co and ni .    because of the high electronegativity of f , the mms of the aus - f@xmath0mpc - sau systems generally are less than or equal to those of aus - mpc - sau",
    "for m @xmath4 cr , cu , and zn the mms of the aus-(f@xmath0mpc)-sau junctions agree with those of the isolated molecules , independent of @xmath5 . in most cases ,",
    "the mms do not change when increasing @xmath5 from 4 to 8 ev , especially in the fluorinated systems .",
    "the magnetic moments generally are slightly higher for the interacting case ( @xmath16 or 8 ev ) than for zero coulomb interaction , which is reasonable since increasing @xmath5 will lead to a decrease of hybridization among the d electrons .    in order to obtain some further insight into the above results",
    ", we also studied in some detail the charge and spin density isosurfaces of the considered systems .",
    "for example , the charge isosurfaces of isolated scpc was presented already in @xcite ( fig .",
    "2 ) , with the result that there is hardly any charge on the metal . in the transport situation , this does not change ; however , due to the good coupling to the au leads , which is mediated by the above - mentioned addition of an s atom , some charge is being transferred to the contact region .",
    "the good coupling is also apparent in the spin isosurface . as a function of the interaction parameter @xmath5",
    ", it is found that the spin density is elongated along the transport direction , and that some spin density is shifted towards the leads , which is a general trend obtained from the smeagol data .    as another example",
    ", the spin density isosurface of aus - agpc - sau is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . for clarity of presentation , we show here and in the next figure only the spin isosurface for the molecule plus the first au atom on both sides , i.e.  we cut out the remaining part of the leads . of course",
    ", the isosurfaces were computed for the complete system . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the above - mentioned good coupling is clearly visible as a relatively strong spin contributions at and near the contact .",

    "most notable is the fact that the spin on fe appears to be the same for the two cases , in agreement with the results for the magnetic moment , cf .",

    "concerning the fluorinated fepc system ( right ) , the spin density is clearly smaller than for fepc ; cf .",

    "the next higher one is cupc with @xmath62 .",
    "this value is smaller than the experimental result found in aromatic molecules by two orders of magnitude @xcite , but our result roughly agrees with another theoretical calculation @xcite .",

    "on the other hand , when the conductance is finite at @xmath6 , we find it either to remain constant or to decrease with increasing @xmath5 .",

    "in this paper we studied systematically the magnetic , electronic and transport properties of metal phtahlocyanines and fluorinated metal phthalocyanines connected to au leads , including some mpc molecules which are chemically unstable .",
    "we employed the lda+@xmath5 approach , with values of the coulomb interaction parameter ranging from @xmath6 to @xmath27 ev .",
    "the magnetic moments are largely determined by the hybridization between d metal and au states near the fermi energy .",
    "the magnetic moments ( table [ table1 ] ) to some extent vary with the electron - electron interaction on the central metal atom , @xmath5 , which also for some systems considerably modifies the spin filter efficiency ( table [ table2 ] ) .",
    "considering eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , it is apparent that the spin filter efficiency is a very sensitive quantity whenever the transmission coefficients for both channels are very small .",
    "in particular , the magnetic moments are found to increase with increasing correlation , or are roughly independent of @xmath5 .",
    "for the transport properties , the situation is less clear : it appears that for some systems the spin filter efficiency hardly depends on @xmath5 , while others are quite sensitive to correlation effects .",
    "there can be a remarkable difference between mpc and its fluorinated counterpart . in detail , the results can be explained by the respective electronic structure near the fermi surface , which , however , is not only determined by the orbitals of the central metal atom but also by the coupling to the leads . in order to finally clarify the role of electronic correlation in the series of junctions considered , additional experimental efforts will be needed .",
    "overall our theoretical results compare well with other theoretical and experimental results for the electronic conductance where these are available .",
    "the structures with ag in the center of the junction are a notable exception : they show both a good spin filter efficiency _ and _ a reasonable electronic conductance since the contribution of ag states at the fermi energy is large .",

    "<S> the magnetic and transport properties of the metal phthalocyanine ( mpc ) and f@xmath0mpc ( m = sc , ti , v , cr , mn , fe , co , ni , cu , zn and ag ) families of molecules in contact with s - au wires are investigated by density functional theory within the local density approximation , including local electronic correlations on the central metal atom . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic moments are found to be considerably modified under fluorination . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , they do not depend exclusively on the configuration of the outer electronic shell of the central metal atom ( as in isolated mpc and f@xmath0mpc ) but also on the interaction with the leads . </S>",
