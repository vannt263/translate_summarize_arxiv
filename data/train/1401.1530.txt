    "let @xmath2 \\times\\mathbb{r}^{d}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{r}^{d}$ ] be a deterministic , time dependent vector field , that we call drift .",
    "let @xmath3 be a brownian motion in @xmath4 , defined on a probability space @xmath5 with respect to a filtration @xmath6 and let @xmath7 be a real number .",
    "the following three stochastic equations are ( at least formally ) related :    1 .",
    "the stochastic differential equation ( _ sde _ ) @xmath8 where @xmath9 ; the unknown @xmath10}$ ] is a stochastic process in @xmath4 ; 2 .",
    "the stochastic transport equation ( _ ste _ ) @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and stratonovich multiplication is used ( precise definitions will be given below ) ; the unknown @xmath15 , x\\in \\mathbb{r}^{d}}$ ] is a scalar random field , 3 .",
    "the stochastic continuity equation ( _ sce _ ) @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a measure , @xmath18 stands for @xmath19 , the unknown @xmath20 } $ ] is a family of random measures on @xmath4 , and thus the differential operations have to be understood in the sense of distributions .    the aim of this paper is to investigate several questions for these equations in the case when the drift is in a subcritical or even critical space , a case not reached by any approach until now .      for comparison with the results due to the presence of noise",
    ", we first address the deterministic case @xmath22 .",
    "we start by explaining the link between the three equations and recall some classical results   in the positive and in the negative direction   under various regularity assumptions on the drift @xmath23 .",
    "when @xmath23 is smooth enough , then :    * the sde generates a flow @xmath24 of diffeomorphisms ; * the ste is uniquely solvable in suitable spaces , and @xmath25 ; * the sce is uniquely solvable in suitable spaces , and @xmath26 is the push forward of @xmath17 under @xmath27 , @xmath28",
    ".    these links between the three equations can be either proved a posteriori , after the equations have been solved by their own arguments , or they can be used to solve one equation by means of the other .",
    "well - posedness of the previous equations and links between them have been explored also when @xmath23 is less regular . to simplify the exposition ,",
    "let us summarize with the term weakly differentiable  the classes of non - smooth @xmath23 considered in  @xcite . in these works",
    "it has been proved that ste and sce are well - posed in classes of weak solutions when @xmath23 is weakly differentiable ; and a generalized or lagrangian flows for the sde exists .",
    "remarkable is the fact that the flow is obtained by a preliminary solution of the ste or of the sce , see  @xcite ( later on in  @xcite , similar result have been obtained directly on sde ) .    in the deterministic case , however , when the regularity of @xmath23 is too poor , several problems arise .",
    "there are two types of problems that can arise at the level of the sde and its flow :    1 .",
    "non - uniqueness of solutions , and , more generally , presence of discontinuity in the flow ; 2 .   non - injectivity of the flow ( two trajectories can coalesce ) and , more generally , mass concentration .",
    "these phenomena have counterparts at the level of the associated sce and ste :    1 .",
    "non - uniqueness for the sde leads to non - uniqueness for sce and ste ; 2 .",
    "non - injectivity of the flow leads to shocks in the ste ( i.e.absence of continuous solutions , even starting from a continuous initial datum ) while mass concentration means that a measure - valued solution of the sce does not remain distributed .",
    "elementary examples can be easily constructed by means of continuous drifts in dimension 1 ; more sophisticated examples in higher dimension , with bounded measurable and divergence free drift can be found in  @xcite .",
    "for instance , concerning regularity , let us mention more precisely an easy example .",
    "consider , in @xmath29 , the drift @xmath30 for some @xmath31 .",
    "all trajectories of the ode coalesce at @xmath32 in finite time ; the solution to the deterministic te develops a shock ( discontinuity ) in finite time , at @xmath32 , from every smooth initial condition @xmath33 such that @xmath34 for some @xmath35 ; the deterministic ce concentrates mass at @xmath32 in finite time , if the initial mass is not zero .",
    "see also section  [ ex_section ] for similar examples of drift terms leading to non - uniqueness or coalescence of trajectories for the deterministic ode ( which in turn results in non - uniqueness and discontinuities / mass concentration for the pdes ) .",
    "notice that the outstanding results of  @xcite are concerned only with uniqueness of weak solutions . in the deterministic case ,",
    "the only results to our knowledge about regularity of solutions with rough drifts are those of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  3.3 ) relative to the loss of regularity of solutions to the transport equation when the vector field satisfies a log - lipschitz condition , which is a far better situation than those considered in this paper .",
    "we shall prove below that these phenomena disappear in the presence of noise .",
    "of course they also disappear in the presence of viscosity , but random perturbations of transport type @xmath36 and viscosity @xmath37 are completely different mechanisms . the ste remains an hyperbolic equation , in the sense that the solution follows the characteristics of the single particles ( so we do not expect regularization of an irregular initial datum ) ; on the contrary , the insertion of a viscous term corresponds to some average , making the equation of parabolic type .",
    "one could interpret transport noise as a turbulent motion of the medium where transport of a passive scalar takes place , see  @xcite , which is different from a dissipative mechanism , although some of the consequences on the passive scalar may have similarities .      in the stochastic case , @xmath39 , when @xmath23 is smooth enough , the existence of a stochastic flow of diffeomorphisms @xmath40 for the sde , the well posedness of ste and the relation @xmath41",
    "are again known results , see @xcite ; the link with sce could be established as well .",
    "however , the stochastic case offers a new possibility : that due to nontrivial _",
    "regularization effects of the noise _ , well posedness of sde , ste and sce remains true also even if the drift @xmath23 is quite poor , opposite to the deterministic case .",
    "notice that we are not talking about the well known regularization effect of a laplacian or an expected value . by regularization",
    "we mean that some of the pathologies mentioned above about the deterministic case ( non uniqueness , blow - up ) may disappear even at the level of a single trajectory @xmath42 ; we do not address any regularization of solutions in time , i.e.  that solutions become more regular than the initial conditions , a fact that is clearly false when we expect relations like @xmath43 .",
    "the aim of this work is to prove several results in this direction and develop a sort of comprehensive theory on this topic .",
    "the results in this paper are considerably advanced and are obtained by means of new powerful strategies , which give a more complete theory .",
    "the list of our main results is described in the next three subsections ; in a few sentences , we are concerned with :    * regularity for the transport ( and continuity ) equation ; * uniqueness for the continuity ( and transport ) equation ; * uniqueness for the sde and regularity for the flow .    in the following subsections , we will explain the results in more detail and give precise references to previous works on the topics .",
    "moreover , we will also analyze the crucial regularity assumptions on the drift term ( discussing its criticality in a heuristic way and via appropriate examples , which are either classical or elaborated at the end of the paper ) .      as already highlighted before",
    ", the key point for the question of existence , uniqueness and regularity of the solutions to the relevant equations is the regularity assumption on the drift @xmath23 . in particular",
    ", we will not assume any kind of differentiability or hlder condition on @xmath23 , but merely an integrability condition .",
    "we say that a vector field @xmath44 \\times\\mathbb{r }   ^{d}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{r}^{d}$ ] satisfies the ladyzhenskaya - prodi - serrin condition ( lps ) with exponents @xmath45 if @xmath46;l^{p}(\\mathbb{r}^{d},\\mathbb{r}^{d } ) ) , \\qquad\\frac{d}{p}+\\frac{2}{q}\\leq1.\\ ] ] we shall write @xmath47 ( the precise definition will be given in section [ subsection regularity assumptions ] ) , and we shall use the same notation for scalar - valued functions .",
    "we use the norm @xmath48;l^{p } ) } : = \\bigg(\\int_{0}^{t}\\big(\\int_{\\mathbb{r}^{d } } \\vert f(t , x ) \\vert^{p } dx \\big)^{q / p } dt \\bigg ) ^{1/q}.\\ ] ] we may extend the definition to the limit case @xmath49 in the natural way : we say that @xmath50 if @xmath51 and we use the norm @xmath52 with the usual meaning of the ess - sup norm @xmath53 . the extension to the other limit case , @xmath54 is more critical ( similarly to the theory of 3d navier - stokes equations , see below ) .",
    "the easy case is when @xmath55 is interpreted as continuity in time : @xmath56 ; l^{d } (   \\mathbb{r}^{d},\\mathbb{r}^{d } ) ) $ ] ; on the contrary , @xmath57 is too difficult in general and we shall impose an additional smallness assumption ( this shall be understood implicitly whenever we address the case @xmath58 in this introduction ) .    roughly speaking , our results will hold for a drift @xmath23 which is the sum of a lipschitz function of space ( with some integrability in time ) plus a vector field of lps class . in the sequel of the introduction , for simplicity of exposition",
    ", we shall not mention the lipschitz component anymore , which is however important to avoid that the final results are restricted to drift with integrability ( or at least boundedness ) at infinity .",
    "let us note that when @xmath45 the space @xmath59;l^{p}(\\mathbb{r}^{d } ,   \\mathbb{r}^{d}))$ ] is the closure in the topology @xmath60;l^{p})}$ ] of smooth compact support functions .",
    "the same is true for @xmath56 ; l^{d } (   \\mathbb{r}^{d},\\mathbb{r}^{d}))$ ] . in the limit cases @xmath61 and @xmath62 , using classical mollifiers , there exists a sequence of smooth compact support functions which converges almost surely and has uniform bound in the corresponding norm .",
    "this fact will allow us to follow an approach of a  priori estimates , i.e.  perform all computations for solutions to the equation with smooth coefficients , obtain uniform estimates for the associated solutions , and then deduce the statement after passage to the limit .    we finally want to comment on the significance of the lps condition .",
    "the name lps comes from the authors who identified this condition in fluid dynamics as a class where regularity and well - posedness of 3d navier - stokes equations hold , see @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the limit case @xmath63 generated a lot of research in the theory of 3d navier - stokes equations .",
    "it can be treated almost as the other cases if there is continuity in time or some smallness condition , see for instance @xcite , but the full @xmath64 case is very difficult , see @xcite and related works .",
    "it has been solved only recently , at the price of a very innovative and complex proof . a similar result for",
    "our problem is unknown .",
    "the deep connection of the lps class , especially when @xmath65 , with the theory of 3d navier - stokes equations is one of our main motivations to analyze stochastic transport under such conditions .",
    "we now show that the lps condition is subcritical with strict inequality and critical with equality in the condition @xmath66 .",
    "we have emphasized in the title and elsewhere that we treat the critical case because no other approach is known to attack this case , but the paper includes also the subcritical case .",
    "the intuitive idea is that , near the singularities of @xmath23 , the gaussian velocity field is stronger  than ( or comparable to ) @xmath23 , which results in avoiding non - uniqueness or blow - up of the solution to the equation .",
    "the name critical  comes from the following scaling argument ( done only in a heuristic way since it only serves as motivation ) .",
    "let @xmath67 \\times\\mathbb{r}^{d}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{r}$ ] be a solution to ste . for @xmath68 and @xmath69 , we introduce the scaled function @xmath70 \\times\\mathbb{r}^{d}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{r}$ ] defined as @xmath71 .",
    "we denote by @xmath72 and @xmath73 the derivative of @xmath74 in the first argument and the gradient in the second one ( similarly for @xmath75 ) .",
    "since @xmath76 and @xmath77 , we get that @xmath75 satisfies formally @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the rescaled drift and @xmath80 formally denotes the derivative of @xmath81 at time @xmath82 .",
    "we now want to write the stochastic part in terms of a new brownian motion .",
    "for this purpose , we define a process @xmath83 , via @xmath84 and notice that @xmath85 is a brownian motion with @xmath86 .",
    "thus the previous equation becomes @xmath87 we first choose@xmath88 such that the stochastic part @xmath89 is comparable to the derivative in time @xmath90 .",
    "notice that this is the parabolic scaling , although ste is not parabolic ( but as we will see below , a basic idea of our approach is that certain expected values of the solution satisfy parabolic equations for which the above scaling is the relevant one ) .",
    "now we require that , for small @xmath91 the rescaled drift @xmath92 becomes small or at least controlled in some suitable norm ( in our case , @xmath93 ) .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath94 ( here , the exponent @xmath95 comes from rescaling in space and the exponent @xmath96 from rescaling in time and the choice @xmath97 ) .",
    "so we find    * if lps holds with strict inequality , then @xmath98 goes to @xmath99 as @xmath100 : the stochastic term dominates and we expect a regularizing effect ( subcritical case ) ; * if lps holds with equality , then @xmath101 remains constant : the deterministic drift and the stochastic forcing are comparable ( critical case ) .",
    "this intuitively explains why the analysis of the critical case is more difficult and is missed by the techniques known until now .",
    "notice that , if lps does not hold , then we expect the drift to dominate , so that a general result for regularization by noise is probably false .",
    "in this sense , lps condition should be regarded as optimal .      concerning the issue of regularity ,",
    "we proceed in a unified approach to attack both the ste and the sce simultaneously ( for the sce we have to assume a lps condition also on @xmath102 ) .",
    "in fact , we shall treat a generalized spde of transport type which contains both the ste and the sce as special cases . for this equation",
    "we prove a result which contains as a particular case the following claim :    under lps condition on @xmath23 ( and on @xmath102 for the sce ) , if @xmath33 of class @xmath103 , then there exists a solution to the ste ( similarly for the sce ) of class @xmath104 .    a more detailed statement",
    "is given in section  [ subsection regularity results ] below .",
    "this result is false for @xmath105 , as we mentioned in section  [ subsection deterministic ] .",
    "referring to some of the pathologies which may happen in the deterministic case , we may say that , under regular initial conditions , noise prevents the emergence of _ shocks _ ( discontinuities ) for the ste , and _ singularities _ of the density for the sce ( the mass at time @xmath106 has a locally bounded density with respect to lebesgue measure ) .",
    "the method of proof is completely new .",
    "it is of analytic nature , based on pde manipulations and estimates , opposite to the methods used before in @xcite based on a preliminary construction of the stochastic flow for the sde .",
    "we think that , apart from the result , this new method of proof is the first important technical achievement of this paper ( see section  [ subsection_strategy_regularity ] for a detailed description of the central ingredients of our method ) .",
    "we now want to give some details on the precise statements , the regularity assumptions on drift and the strategy of proof for some known regularity results for the ste , for the purpose of comparison with the results presented here .",
    "the paper  @xcite deals with the case of _ hlder continuous bounded drift _ and is based on the construction of the stochastic flow from  @xcite .",
    "then @xcite deals with the class identified in the sequel as _ krylov - rckner class _ , after  @xcite where pathwise uniqueness and other results are proved for the sde .",
    "we say that a vector field @xmath44 \\times\\mathbb{r}^{d}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{r}^{d}$ ] satisfies the krylov - rckner ( kr ) condition if the lps condition holds with strict inequality @xmath107 we shall write @xmath108 .",
    "the improvement from @xmath109 to @xmath110 appeared also in the theory of 3d navier - stokes equations and required new techniques ( which in turn opened new research directions on @xmath111 regularity ) . also here",
    "it requires a completely new approach . under the condition @xmath112",
    ", we do not know how to solve the sde directly ; even in a weak sense , by girsanov theorem , the strict inequality seems to be needed ( @xcite ) .",
    "similarly to  @xcite , the proof of regularity of solutions of the ste from  @xcite is based on the construction of stochastic flows for the sde and their regularity in terms of weak differentiability . finally ,  @xcite treats the case of _ bounded measurable drift _ ( the classical work under this condition on pathwise uniqueness for the sde is  @xcite ) , again starting from a weak differentiability result for stochastic flows , proved however with methods different from  @xcite .",
    "let us mention that proving that noise prevents blow - up ( in cases where blow - up phenomena are possible in the deterministic situation ) is an intriguing problem that is under investigation also for other equations , different from transport ones , see eg .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the second issue of our work is uniqueness of weak solutions to equations of continuity ( and transport ) type .",
    "more precisely , we will provide a _ path - by - path uniqueness _ result , via a duality approach which relies on the regularity results described in section  [ intro section regularity ] . when uniqueness is understood in a class of weak solutions ,",
    "the adjoint existence result must be in a class of sufficiently regular solutions ; for this reason this approach can not be applied in the deterministic case .    by path - by - path uniqueness",
    "we mean something stronger than pathwise uniqueness : we mean that  given @xmath113 a.s . , the deterministic pde corresponding to that particular @xmath113 has a unique weak solution ( our spde can be reformulated as random pde and then read in a proper sense at @xmath113 fixed , and in this sense , for a.e .",
    "@xmath113 , it admits a unique solution ) .",
    "instead , pathwise uniqueness means that two processes , hence families indexed by @xmath113 , both solutions of the equation , coincide for a.e .",
    "we prove :    under lps condition on @xmath23 ( and also on @xmath102 for ste ) , the sce ( similarly the ste ) has path - by - path uniqueness of weak @xmath114-solutions , for every finite @xmath115 .    a more precise statement",
    "is given in section  [ subsection path by path uniq ] below .",
    "no other method is known to produce such a strong result of uniqueness .",
    "this duality method in the stochastic setting is the second important technical achievement of this paper .    the intuitive reason why , by duality , one can prove _ path - by - path _ uniqueness ( usually so difficult to be proven ) is the following one .",
    "the duality approach gives us an identity of the form @xmath116 where @xmath117 is any weak solution of the sce ( @xmath117 is the density of @xmath26 ) with initial condition @xmath118 and @xmath119   } $ ] is any regular solution of the ste rewritten in backward form with final condition @xmath120 at time @xmath106 .",
    "as we shall see below , we use an approximate version of  , but the idea we want to explain here is the same .",
    "identity   holds a.s .  in @xmath121 , for any given @xmath120 and @xmath106 . but taking a dense ( in a suitable topology ) countable set @xmath122 of @xmath120 s , we have   for a.e .",
    "@xmath42 , uniformly on @xmath122 and thus we may identify @xmath117 . in a sentence , this is the reason why this approach is so powerful to prove path - by - path results .",
    "of course behind this simple idea , the main technical point is the regularity of the solutions to the ste , which makes it possible to prove an identity of the form   for weak solutions @xmath117 , for all those @xmath42 s such that @xmath123 is regular enough .",
    "concerning previous results of uniqueness for ste with poor drift ,  @xcite treats the case of hlder continuous bounded drift , using the differentiable flow associated to the sde ;  @xcite assumes weakly differentiable drift but relaxes the assumption on the divergence of the drift , with respect to the deterministic works  @xcite ;  @xcite is close to kr class , by means of a chaos expansion technique ( the uniqueness result is in a slightly restrictive class compared to the other ones ) .",
    "a full solution of the uniqueness problem in the kr class was still open and this is a by - product of this paper , which solves the problem in a stronger sense in two directions :    * path - by - path uniqueness instead of pathwise uniqueness ; * drift in the lps class instead of only kr class .",
    "let us mention that the approach to uniqueness of  @xcite shares some technical steps with the results described in section  [ intro section regularity ] : renormalization of solutions ( in the sense of  @xcite ) , it reformulation of the stratonovich equation and then expected value ( a laplacian arises from this procedure ) .",
    "however , in  @xcite this approach has been applied directly to uniqueness of weak solutions so the renormalization step required weak differentiability of the drift . on the contrary , here we deal with regularity of solutions and thus the renormalization is applied to regular solutions of approximate problems ;  no additional assumption on the drift is necessary .",
    "the last issue of our paper is to provide existence , uniqueness and regularity of stochastic flows for the sde , imposing merely the lps condition .",
    "the strategy here is to deduce such results from the path - by - path uniqueness established in section  [ intro section uniqueness ] .    to understand the novelties , let us recall that the more general strong well posedness result for the sde is due to  @xcite under kr condition on @xmath23 .",
    "to simplify the exposition and unify the discussion of the literature , let us consider the autonomous case @xmath124 and an assumption of the form @xmath125 ( depending on the reference , various locality conditions and behavior at infinity are assumed ) .",
    "the condition @xmath126 seems to be the limit case for solvability in all approaches , see for instance @xcite , independently they are based on girsanov theorem , krylov estimates , parabolic theory and dirichlet forms .",
    "even the result of weak well posedness for measure valued drift of  @xcite , when restricted to measures with density @xmath23 with respect to lebesgue measure , requires @xmath126 , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 2.3 ) .",
    "the present paper is the first one to give information on sdes in the limit case @xmath127 .",
    "since path - by - path solvability is another issue related to our results , let us mention  @xcite , when the drift is bounded measurable : for a.e .",
    "@xmath128 , there exists one and only one solution .",
    "new results for several classes of noise and drift have been obtained by  @xcite . in general , the problem of path - by - path solvability of an sde with poor drift is extremely difficult , compared to pathwise uniqueness which is already nontrivial .",
    "thus it is remarkable that the approach by duality developed here gives results in this direction .",
    "our contribution on the sde is threefold : existence and uniqueness of lagrangian flows , pathwise uniqueness from a diffuse initial datum and path - by - path uniqueness from given initial condition .",
    "the following subsections details these three classes of results .",
    "we prove a well posedness result among lagrangian flows ( see below for more explanations ) under lps condition on the drift :    under lps condition , for a.e .",
    "@xmath42 , there exists a unique lagrangian flow @xmath129 solving the sde at @xmath42 fixed .",
    "this flow is @xmath130-regular for every finite @xmath115 , in particular @xmath131 for every @xmath132 .",
    "uniqueness will follow from uniqueness of the sce , regularity from regularity of the solution to the ste .",
    "the result is new because our uniqueness result is path - by - path : for a.e .",
    "@xmath42 , two lagrangian flows solving the sde with that @xmath42 fixed must coincide ( notice that the sde has a clear path - by - path meaning ) .",
    "a lagrangian flow @xmath40 , solving a given ode , is a generalized flow , in the sense of  @xcite : a measurable map @xmath133 with a certain non - contracting property , such that @xmath134 verifies that ode for a.e .",
    "initial condition @xmath135",
    ". however , in general , we do not construct solutions of the sde in a classical sense , corresponding to a given initial condition @xmath136 .",
    "in fact we do not know whether or not strong solutions exist and are unique under the lps condition with @xmath110 ( for @xmath137 strong solutions exist , see  @xcite ) .",
    "we also prove a ( classical ) pathwise uniqueness result under lps condition , when the initial datum has a diffuse law .",
    "this is done by exploiting the regularity result of the ste and by using a duality technique similar to the one mentioned before .",
    "if @xmath138 is a diffuse random variable ( not a single @xmath135 ) on @xmath139 , then pathwise uniqueness holds among solutions having diffuse marginal laws ( more precisely , such that the law of @xmath140 has a density in @xmath141;l^m({\\mathbb{r}}^d))$ ] , for a suitable @xmath115 ) .",
    "finally we notice that uniqueness of the law of solutions ( or at least of their one - dimensional marginals , namely the solutions of fokker - planck equations ) may hold true for very irregular drift , i.e.  @xmath142 , if diffuse initial conditions with suitable density are considered ; see @xcite .",
    "moreover , let us mention  @xcite where uniqueness of weak solutions is proved under kr condition , in the particular case when @xmath143 .",
    "this restriction is removed here and the limit case lps is also reached .",
    "when the regularity results for the stochastic equation of transport type is improved from @xmath144 to @xmath145-regularity , then the uniqueness results of section  [ intro section uniqueness ] for the sce holds in the very general class of finite measures and it is an path - by - path uniqueness result . as a consequence , we get an analogous path - by - path uniqueness result for the sde with classical given initial conditions , a result competitive with  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the main problem is to find assumptions , as weak as possible , on the drift @xmath23 which are sufficient to guarantee @xmath145 regularity of the solutions .",
    "we describe two cases .",
    "the first one , which follows the strategy described in section 1.1 , is when the weak derivatives of @xmath23 ( instead of only @xmath23 itself ) belongs to the lps class , that is @xmath146 .",
    "however , since this is a weak differentiability assumption , it is less general than expected .",
    "the second case is when @xmath23 is hlder continuous ( in space ) and bounded , but here we have to refer to  @xcite for the proof of the main regularity results .    if @xmath147 belongs to lps class or if @xmath23 is hlder continuous ( in space ) , then , for a.e .",
    "@xmath42 , for every @xmath135 in @xmath139 , there exists a unique solution to the sde , starting from @xmath135 , at @xmath42 fixed .",
    "notice that the `` good subset '' of @xmath121 is independent of the initial condition @xmath135 ; this is not obvious from the approaches of  @xcite , due to the application of girsanov transform for a given initial condition .",

    "in this section we present some examples of drifts under lps conditions , which exhibit regularization by noise phenomena ( i.e.  the ode is ill - posed , the sde is well - posed ) , and an example outside lps conditions where our results do not hold .      given a real number @xmath1121 , we consider on @xmath139 the autonomous vector field @xmath1357 where @xmath1358 is the versor in direction @xmath135 .",
    "the vector field @xmath23 is lipschitz continuous if and only if @xmath1359 ; it satisfies lps conditions if and only if @xmath1360 . in the deterministic case ,",

    "if @xmath1361 , there can not exist a continuous flow solving the ode : continuity fails in @xmath1371 .",
    "this also implies that non - uniqueness appears for the transport equation with discontinuous ( at @xmath99 ) initial datum .    on the contrary , for @xmath1360",
    "the drift is in the lps class , hence all our results apply to this example and show regularization by noise in various ways .",
    "in particular , the discontinuity of the flow in the origin is removed @xmath42-wise ; moreover , for @xmath277 ( when @xmath23 is hlder continuous ) , we have proved path - by - path uniqueness starting from @xmath1371 .",
    "let us also remind that pathwise uniqueness holds , starting from @xmath99 , by  @xcite .",
    "+ in this particular example it is possible to have an intuitive idea , `` by hands '' , of what happens . if one consider the ode without noise starting from @xmath99 , any solution @xmath155 grows near @xmath99 no faster than @xmath1377 ; on the contrary , the brownian motion @xmath81 near @xmath99 grows as @xmath1378 ( this is false , but only for a logarithmic correction , which does not affect the intuition ) .",
    "heuristically , we could say that the `` speed '' of @xmath155 near @xmath99 which is caused by the drift is like @xmath1379 , while the one caused by @xmath81 is like @xmath1380 .",
    "so what we expect to happen is that the brownian motion moves the particle immediately away from @xmath99 , faster than the action of the drift , and this prevents the formation of non - uniqueness or singularities .",
    "at least in the one - dimensional case , this can be seen also through speed measure and scale function , see  @xcite .    notice that if @xmath1381 the opposite phenomenon appears ( @xmath155 is faster than @xmath81 ) , so that we expect ill - posedness .",
    "this is also an argument for the optimality of the lps conditions ( even if , in this case , we do not look at critical cases in lps hypotheses ) .",
    "see also the counterexample  [ counterex ] .",
    "we consider a similar autonomous vector field as in the previous example , but change sign : @xmath1382 in this case , we see that , for every initial @xmath1365 , there exists a unique solution @xmath155 to the ode , which reaches  @xmath99 in finite time and then stays in  @xmath99 .",
    "thus concentration appears in  @xmath99 , so that there does not exist a lagrangian flow ( the image measure of the flow at time @xmath106 can have a dirac delta in  @xmath99 ) .",
    "moreover the solution to the continuity equation concentrates in  @xmath99 .",
    "again our results apply when @xmath1360 , so these concentration phenomena disappear in the stochastic case .",
    "take @xmath479 for simplicity .",
    "the following field is a combination of the previous two examples : @xmath1383 + 1_{x\\in a^c}[-1_{0<|x|\\le1}|x|^{\\alpha}\\hat{x}-1_{|x|>1}x],\\ ] ] where @xmath1384 .",

    "<S> the technique needed to reach the critical case is new and based on parabolic equations satisfied by moments of first derivatives of the solution , opposite to previous works based on stochastic flows . </S>",
    "<S> the approach extends to higher order derivatives under more regularity of the drift term . by a duality approach , </S>",
    "<S> the results are then applied to prove uniqueness of weak solutions to linear stochastic continuity and transport equations and certain well posedness results for the associated stochastic differential equation ( sde ) ( roughly speaking , existence and uniqueness of flows and their @xmath1 regularity , strong uniqueness for the sde when the initial datum has diffuse law ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show two types of examples : on the one hand , we present well - posed sdes , when the corresponding odes are ill - posed , and on the other hand , we give a counterexample in the supercritical case . </S>"
