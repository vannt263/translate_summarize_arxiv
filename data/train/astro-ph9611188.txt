    "the non - axisymmetric shape of a ns can be caused by anisotropic stresses from the nuclear interactions , irregularities in the solid crust ( `` mountains '' ) @xcite , the internal magnetic field @xcite , some precessional motion @xcite , or the development of triaxial instabilities ( for the most rapidly rotating ns ) : the chandrasekhar - friedman - schutz instability @xcite and the maclaurin - jacobi type instability induced by viscosity @xcite .",

    "the crucial parameter entering this formula is the ellipticity @xmath3 .",
    "its value depends on the physical mechanism that makes the star non - axisymmetric ( cf .",
    "the references given above ) and is highly uncertain .",
    "upper bounds on @xmath3 can however be derived from the observed slowing down ( @xmath4 ) of pulsars by assuming that this latter is entirely due to the loss of angular momentum by gravitational radiation .",
    "let us note that this provides an absolute upper bound ; most of the @xmath4 is usually thought to result instead from losses via electromagnetic radiation and/or magnetospheric acceleration of charged particles  at least for crab - like pulsars .",

    "the proposed strategy consists in measuring the square of the gravitational signal , @xmath17 , and in detecting the sidereal modulation of this signal which results from the directivity of the detector and the anisotropy of the ns distribution .",
    "this technique ( referred hereafter as _",
    "quadratic detection _ ) is very similar to the one used in radioastronomy when only one antenna is used and differs from the strategy proposed by schutz @xcite that consists in searching for ns one by one within a 4-dimensional space ( frequency , phase and position on the sky ) ( technique referred hereafter as _ linear detection _ ) .",
    "the advantages and drawbacks of the two strategies are discussed and it will be shown that if the number of the emitting stars is larger than @xmath18 , then the signal squaring technique is more convenient and more computer time saving than the linear one . actually , the two techniques appear to be complementary .",

    "[ s : stat ] the statistical properties of the squared signal are briefly recalled .",
    "the efficiency of the method as a function of the ns number and of the range of frequency at which they are supposed to radiate is computed , the comparison with the linear analysis for single ns search being performed in sect .",

    "[ s : galactic ] , we try to evaluate the number of gravitationally emitting ns in our galaxy and the range of frequencies at which they are supposed to radiate .",

    "the response @xmath19 of an interferometric detector to the gravitational radiation emitted by @xmath20 ns spread out on the sky is detailed in appendix  [ s : append , average ] . for the purpose of this section , let us consider that @xmath19 is the sum of @xmath20 elementary periodic functions @xmath21 with unknown frequencies @xmath22 and phases @xmath23 , the precise form being given by eqs .",

    "is induced by the directivity of the detector and the anisotropy of the ns distribution .",
    "the study of the efficiency of the quadratic technique is made easy by the close analogy with the radioastronomy observation technique .",
    "radioastronomers measure the square of the electromagnetic field emitted by a large ensemble of collective modes of a plasma .",
    "they are confronted to the problem of extracting some signal from the noise of the receiver .",
    "one possible technique consists in scanning the sky around the source , and in measuring the differences of the total noise on / off of the source . in the case of gravitational waves ,",
    "the source is scanned by the interferometric detector via the rotation of the earth .",
    "let us also notice that the problem of detection of the gravitational wave emission from an ensemble of ns is very close to the search for a gravitational cosmological background discussed in great details by flanagan @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the main and basic difference is the daily modulation of the signal from the ns ensemble , which allows the search to be performed with _ only one _ detector instead of two detectors required for the cosmological background detection @xcite .",

    "we obtain : s^2(t)= h^2(t)+ n^2(t ) because noise and signal are not correlated and consequently the average of the cross product @xmath40 vanishes . here",

    "the above expression then reads n^2(t)=^2 the quantity @xmath48 is time dependent : there are high frequency time variations with a typical frequency of ns rotation , and a low frequency time variation due to the slow change of the orientation of the interferometer arms with respect to the galaxy induced by the earth rotation .",
    "this latter frequency , @xmath49 , is equal to the inverse of one sidereal day : @xmath50 s. it is this modulation that must be searched for .    in practice ,",
    "observations are performed with only one detector ; consequently the ensemble average @xmath51 must be replaced by an average on time . in what follows",

    "the two methods become then equivalent for @xmath90 ns .",
    "however , in searching for a single ns , its position has to be known with an accuracy high enough to compensate for the doppler shift of the frequency induced by the rotation of the earth and its motion around the sun .",
    "the last effect is the most important one .",
    "the accuracy of the declination @xmath91 and in the azimuth @xmath92 is about @xmath93 where @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 are respectively the radius of the earth orbit ( @xmath97 ) , the expected maximum frequency of the ns and the speed of light .",
    "a similar precision is needed on the declination of the source .",
    "this means that the sky must divided in about @xmath98 boxes and we have to try to detect a periodic source ( by fourier transform ) in each box , after compensation of the variation of the frequency of the source due to the earth motion . in the above rough analysis ,",

    "consequently eq .",
    "( [ effic . ] ) becomes [ efic2 ] e=10 ( c t)^1/42 ^ 3/4 n^1/2 the two methods become then equivalent for @xmath105 .",
    "the above results hold under the hypothesis that the term @xmath106 in eq .",
    "( [ quadn ] ) is constant , i.e. that the noise is stationary .",
    "now the actual noise is not stationary : low frequency fluctuations are always present .",
    "let us recall that the sources of noise in interferometric detectors are the photon shot noise ( at high frequency ) and the brownian noise of the mirrors ( at low frequency ) .",
    "there are at least two sources of low frequency fluctuations : ( i ) the fluctuations of the optical power of the laser and ( ii ) the temperature fluctuations of the mirrors .",
    "when the interferometer is in lock , the fluctuations of the laser power can be taken under control within few @xmath107 and are therefore not dangerous at all .",

    "as stated above , we consider only the contribution to the noise due to the temperature . in this case , the noise @xmath114 is proportional to the temperature @xmath115 @xcite @xcite : [ e : hn2=bt ] n^2 ( ) =  . under the above hypotheses , eq .",

    "t^t+t n^2(t ) dt = ^2 + ^2 ( t ) + ( t )  .",
    "the random variable @xmath111 has a zero mean value , @xmath117 , and its variance @xmath118 is proportional to the temperature fluctuations of the mirrors .",
    "consequently the typical time scale for @xmath111 is of the order of one hour , much longer than @xmath119 .",
    "the typical amplitude of the temperature variation is a few kelvins , much smaller than the room temperature ( @xmath120 ) , therefore the above hypotheses are fulfilled .",
    "it is worth to note that in defining @xmath111 and its statistical properties we have averaged on time , instead of averaging on an infinite ensemble of identical detectors .",
    "the reason is that for _ identical _ detectors in the same environment , the daily variation of the temperature , and consequently the amplitude of the thermal noise , is the same for _ all _ the detectors .",
    "the fluctuations of the mirrors temperature are not known today . only in situ measurements of the temperature , once the detector will be operational , will provide us with the statistical properties of @xmath111 . however , let us try to guess the temperature trends of the mirrors , in order to see if the precision needed on the temperature control can be achieved with the present technology .",
    "one reasonable hypothesis is to take a power law for the fourier spectrum of the temperature fluctuations @xmath121 : [ spectrum ] ( ) ^2 = a^2_t  ( _ t ) ^- where @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 are some constants .",
    "these parameter can be estimated in the following way . according to eq .",

    "let us now estimate the precision required in the temperature monitoring in order that the amplitude of the temperature noise be lower than the `` ordinary '' noise @xmath116 . from eq .",
    "( [ quadn3 ] ) , this requirement writes @xmath134 .",
    "taking into account that @xmath135 , @xmath136 ( eq .  ( [ stpsi ] ) ) , and @xmath132 , one obtains from eq .",
    "( [ spectrum ] ) the condition ( for @xmath76 ) : a < ^3/2_t ^1/2 = 4.8 10 ^ -3 ( ) ( 10 ^ -5  hz ) ^3/2 ( ) ^1/2  k  . for @xmath137 , @xmath138 , and @xmath139 , we get @xmath140 .",
    "this value is one hundred times smaller than the actual value of @xmath141 obtained above from the expected daily temperature variation ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "since at this frequency ( @xmath142 ) , the amplitude of the temperature variation is about @xmath129 , this means that the temperature fluctuations have to be monitored with a precision of @xmath143 for the extra - noise to be extracted from the `` ordinary '' noise @xmath116 .",
    "a _ periodic _ modulation due to the variation of the solar flux might be present in the power spectrum of the mirror temperature fluctuations",
    ". maybe this will not be the case , given the amount of shielding the vacuum system and suspension will provide to the mirrors .",
    "we however consider temperature fluctuations correlated with the solar flux because they represent the most dangerous obstacle to the proposed method of detection .",
    "indeed the solar flux spectrum contains , beside the solar day frequency , the sidereal day one , which may pollute the gw signal from galactic ns .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] shows the fourier spectrum of the solar flux at the latitude of pisa ( virgo site ) computed by taking a period of 4 years .",
    "there are important lines at frequencies corresponding to multiples of the inverse of one solar day ( @xmath144 ) , as well as important lines at frequencies that are multiple of the inverse of one sidereal day ( @xmath145 ) .",
    "these latter lines can be explained by looking at the expression giving the solar flux as a function of time : the daily solar flux is modulated by the annual variation of the declination of the sun .",
    "consequently , there exists a line resulting from the beating of the solar frequency @xmath146 with the frequency corresponding to the inverse of the tropical year ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "therefore around the solar frequency , the two frequencies @xmath148 are present , and in particular the sidereal day frequency @xmath149 .    the possible temperature fluctuation spectrum induced by the solar flux can be written [ spec2 ] ( ) ^2 = _ j b^2_j(-_j )  , where the @xmath150 are the solar flux frequencies displayed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "let us compute the level at which the temperature of the mirrors has to be taken under control , in order to have the amplitude of this extra - noise lower than the `` ordinary '' noise @xmath116 .",

    "( [ quadn ] ) , ( [ stpsi ] ) and ( [ quadn2 ] ) )",
    ". taking into account that the thickness of the bin of a fourier transform of a signal of length @xmath52 is @xmath155 , we have @xmath156 ; the corresponding periodic temperature variation @xmath157 must be less than @xmath158 ( @xmath76 ) .      from the above analysis it appears that the non - periodic temperature fluctuations of the mirrors are not very dangerous , because an accuracy of @xmath159 in the mirror temperature measurement seems easily reachable .",
    "on the contrary , the periodic fluctuations must be kept under control within a few @xmath160 for observation times longer than one year .",
    "this seems to be a challenging task .",
    "however , it must be noticed that the periodic temperature fluctuations can be measured on time intervals of the order of one year , and therefore are easier to control .",

    ", we recommend that all the detector parameters ( temperature of the mirrors , power of the laser and so on ) shall be monitored .",
    "in fact , as already said , we do not need any regulation of the temperature , but only to know , with the accuracy discussed above , _ how _ the temperature varies .",

    "the lower bound of the interferometer bandwidth ( @xmath175 ) is a sensitive parameter for increasing the number of accessible ns .",
    "if the observed radio pulsars are representative of the population of rotating ns , lowering @xmath176 from @xmath177 to @xmath178 would increase the number of observable ns by a factor @xmath179 .    in the following , we set the low frequency threshold of virgo to the value @xmath180 , which may be reachable in a second stage of the experiment .",
    "using the fact that the highest gravitational frequency of a star which rotates at the frequency @xmath181 is @xmath182 , this means that the rotation period of a detectable ns must be lower than @xmath183 .",
