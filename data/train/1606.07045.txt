    "can also be obtained from such alternative theories @xcite .",
    "another reputed alternative gravity model was proposed in @xcite , named the @xmath0 theories of gravity , which present in their field equations extra contributions from both geometry , through a general dependence on @xmath7 , and matter , through a general dependence on @xmath8 , the trace of the energy - momentum tensor ( emt ) .",
    "the @xmath8-dependence is motivated by the consideration of exotic imperfect fluids or quantum effects .",

    "the authors have introduced bulk viscosity in the @xmath0 formalism within the framework of a flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) model .",
    "since the dependence on @xmath8 of the gravitational part of the action might come from the consideration of imperfect fluids , the authors have investigated more realistic models , by explicitly taking into account dissipative processes due to viscosity . on this regard , it is known that when neutrinos decoupled in the early universe , matter could have behaved like a viscous fluid",
    ".    moreover , in @xcite , a little rip model in @xmath0 gravity was investigated .",
    "an analysis of @xmath0 models through energy conditions can be found in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath0 theories were generalized , by allowing the speed of light to vary , resulting in a primordial scenario alternative to inflation .",
    "a complete cosmological scenario was derived from the @xmath9 formalism , which is nothing but the @xmath0 theory in the presence of a scalar field , in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath0 theories of gravity have also been expanded to five dimensions , as explored in @xcite .",
    "very recent contributions of @xmath0 gravity to cosmology , thermodynamics and astrophysics can be found , respectively in @xcite .",
    "the well - behaved cosmological models cited above , among others found in the literature , make reasonable and promising to consider the @xmath0 gravity as a possible alternative to general relativity ( gr ) , from which @xmath6cdm cosmological model is derived .",
    "once the gravitational part of the action is generalized , including a general dependence not only on geometrical terms , as in @xmath3 gravity , but also on material terms through the general dependence on @xmath8 , the new terms of the derived field equations might be responsible for inducting the observed late - time acceleration of the universe expansion with no need of a cosmological constant ( cc ) , which still lacks a convincing physical interpretation @xcite .",
    "moreover , as shown in @xcite , some specific functional forms for @xmath0 may retrieve other cosmological models , as chaplygin gas and quintessence , manifesting the generic aspect of such a theory of gravity , i.e. , different cosmological models found in the literature can be obtained from different particular cases of @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath0 theories , as originally proposed , predict a non - conservation of the matter emt ( memt ) , which will be carefully described in section [ sec : frt ] below .",

    "the @xmath10 issue was considered to be related to an irreversible matter creation process .",

    ", those theories should be tested in a non - usual aspect .",
    "if there is creation of matter throughout the universe history , some kind of signature should be imprinted in the cosmic microwave background anisotropy .",
    "the classical macroscopic theory predictions in structure formation with linear perturbations may also corroborate or debilitate the scenarios with non - conservation of memt .    such a lack of matter creation observational evidences made some authors to evade the non - continuity equation in @xmath0 gravity .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath13 was imposed in @xcite and an alternative to the de problem was obtained . moreover",
    ", the approach has revealed some constraints to the functionality of @xmath14 in @xmath0 . in @xcite",
    "the authors have reconstructed @xmath0 gravity for a specific model that permitted the standard continuity equation to hold .",
    "the dynamics and stability of @xmath0 theory for de - sitter and power - law expansions of the universe with conservation of memt were discussed in @xcite .    in the present approach",
    "we will also evade the non - conservation of memt predicted in @xmath0 theories .",

    "the equation for the non - conservation of the memt is indicated . in section [ sec : c2 ] we distinguish the presence of extra terms in the effective energy - momentum tensor ( eemt ) in @xmath0 formalism and construct a scenario in which there is no violation of the continuity equation .",

    "recently proposed by t. harko and collaborators @xcite , the @xmath0 theory of gravity assumes the gravitational part of the action depends on an arbitrary function of @xmath7 and @xmath8 . according to the authors , the dependence on @xmath8",
    "may be induced by the consideration of exotic fluids or quantum effects .",
    "the total action in such a theory is given by    @xmath15    in ( [ eqn : frt1 ] ) , @xmath0 is the arbitrary function of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath16 is the metric determinant and @xmath12 is the matter lagrangian density . moreover",
    ", we will assume @xmath17 .",
    "the memt is written as    @xmath18    we will assume the matter source is a perfect fluid ( pf ) in ( [ eqn : frt2 ] ) and the universe is homogeneous and isotropic at cosmological scales , i.e. , its geometry is described by an frw metric .",
    "we will also consider a flat universe , in accordance with recent cosmic microwave background observations @xcite , and work with the case @xmath19 , with @xmath20 being a constant .",
    "originally suggested by the @xmath0 gravity authors @xcite , such a functional form for @xmath0 has been extensively used to obtain @xmath0 cosmological solutions ( check @xcite among many others ) . moreover , by assuming @xmath19 , such an @xmath0 functional form benefits from the fact that one can recover gr just by letting @xmath20 to be null .",
    "here it is worth stressing that , as in the present case , when the functionality @xmath21 , with @xmath14 being a function of @xmath8 , is taken into account , the derived models do not predict a matter - geometry coupling , although this case is sometimes considered as a  minimal coupling \" in the literature . a product between @xmath7 and @xmath8 or functions of them in @xmath0",
    "would , rather , lead to an explicit ( non - minimal ) coupling .",
    "such a hitherto non - investigated issue of @xmath0 theory of gravity will be important to this article purposes and concluding remarks , and shall be appreciated later on .",
    "the assumptions above yield , for the variation of the action ( [ eqn : frt1 ] ) with respect to the metric , the following field equations    @xmath22    for which @xmath23 is the usual einstein tensor and @xmath24 is the pressure of the universe .",
    "a notorious feature about @xmath0 theory is the non - nullity of the memt covariance divergence .",
    "recently , the authors in @xcite have recalculated @xmath13 , by arguing that t. harko et al .",
    "@xcite missed an essential term which has consequences in the equation of motion of test particles .",
    "from such an argumentation , the corrected relation for @xmath13 when @xmath19 is    @xmath25.\\ ] ]    note that , as required , the case @xmath26 retrieves gr in both ( [ eqn : frt3 ] ) and ( [ eqn : frt4 ] ) .",
    "the _ lhs _ of the field equations ( [ eqn : frt3 ] ) is exactly the same as in gr , i.e. , given by the einstein tensor .",
    "the _ rhs _ clearly presents some extra terms when compared to standard gravity . in order to obtain an accelerated expanding universe in standard cosmology",
    ", one has to assume that @xmath27 of the universe composition is in the form of some exotic fluid dubbed de , which may enter the gr field equations in the form of a cc emt .",
    "the extra terms in ( [ eqn : frt3 ] ) may , in a sense , play the role of the cc , however , evading the de problem quoted above .    as carefully highlighted in the previous section , eq.([eqn : frt2 ] ) refers to memt . by keeping that in mind we can rewrite ( [ eqn : frt3 ] ) as    @xmath28    with @xmath4 and    @xmath29\\ ] ]    being the extra terms of the eemt @xmath1 .    by considering a pf in equation ( [ eqn : frt2 ] ) yields @xmath30 , with @xmath31 being the matter - energy density of the universe and",

    ", the fluid described by eq.([eqn : hemt2 ] ) permeates the universe along with the ordinary pf which is often considered as the ( only ) matter source of the universe .",
    "effectively , there is one fluid permeating the universe , whose density is given by the sum of the densities of both fluids determined above .",
    "we shall revisit this question later on .",
    "the non - null components of ( [ eqn : hemt1 ] ) yield the friedmann - like equations    @xmath37    @xmath38    with dots representing derivatives with respect to time . as required , when @xmath26 the standard friedmann equations of @xmath6cdm cosmology are retrieved .",
    "when one breaks the eemt in two parts , one responsible for the matter in the universe while the other comes from the dependence of the action on @xmath8 , a remarkable issue about the memt non - conservation , predicted by @xmath0 theories , arises : note that what makes @xmath10 in ( [ eqn : frt4 ] ) is the indistinct presence of @xmath2 defined in eq.([eqn : hemt2 ] ) .",
    "however , the application of the bianchi identities ( @xmath39 ) in ( [ eqn : hemt1 ] ) yields @xmath40=0 $ ] , or :    @xmath41    and    @xmath42    therefore one has two sets of three equations with three unknowns to be solved : ( [ eqn : hemt6 ] ) , ( [ eqn : hemt7 ] ) , ( [ eqn : hemt8 ] ) and ( [ eqn : hemt6 ] ) , ( [ eqn : hemt7 ] ) , ( [ eqn : hemt9 ] ) .    note that by approaching the @xmath0 gravity from such a perspective indeed evades the non - continuity equation originally predicted in the formalism .",
    "the evaluation of ( [ eqn : hemt8 ] ) yields the well - known continuity equation of cosmology :    @xmath43    by recombining eqs.([eqn : hemt6 ] ) , ( [ eqn : hemt7 ] ) and ( [ eqn : hemt10 ] ) , it is straightforward to obtain the following differential equation for the scale factor    @xmath44+\\lambda\\left[\\frac{8\\pi}{3}\\left(\\frac{\\dddot{a}}{\\dot{a}}-\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}\\right)-\\lambda\\frac{\\ddot{a}}{a}\\right]+\\nonumber \\\\ & & ( 8\\pi+4\\lambda)\\left[(8\\pi+3\\lambda)\\frac{\\ddot{a}}{a}+4\\pi\\left(\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}\\right)^{2}\\right]=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath45 .    by developing ( [ eqn : hemt9 ] ) yields    @xmath46    eq.([eqn :",

    "some early universe models indicate that there may have existed a phase prior to the radiation - dominated era in which our universe dynamics was dominated by a gas of baryons with equation of state ( eos ) @xmath67 which interacted through a vector - meson field @xcite .",

    "a primordial sm era is fundamental for any model based on a relativistic scalar field @xcite .",

    "have arose . by developing them",
    ", we obtained eqs.([eqn : hemt10 ] ) and ( [ eqn : hemt12 ] ) .",
    "eq.([eqn : hemt10 ] ) stands for the usual conservation of matter represented by a pf . on the other hand , eq.([eqn : hemt12 ] ) predicts the existence of sm in the universe .    as in another sm cosmological models ( check @xcite , for instance )",
    ", everything happens as if the universe were composed of two non - interacting fluids , in our case , one respecting eq.([eqn : hemt10 ] ) and another submissive to eq.([eqn : hemt12 ] ) .",
    "effectively , we have just one fluid whose energy density is given by the sum of the solutions of eqs.([eqn : hemt10 ] ) and ( [ eqn : hemt12 ] ) ( check fig.[fig3 ] above ) .",
    "despite the lack of observational evidences corroborating scenarios with continuum or episodic creation of particles in cosmological scales , some efforts on this subject have been made @xcite .",
    "one might wonder how the evasion of non - conservation of the memt which is described in section [ sec : c2 ] can coexist with @xmath0 models whose memt is not conserved .",
    "we argue about this issue below .",
    "a matter - curvature coupling is the mechanism considered to be responsible for gravitationally induce particle production in @xmath0 or @xmath11 theories @xcite .",
    "the coupling of matter with higher order derivative curvature terms can be interpreted as an exchange of energy and momentum between them , which induces a gravitational particle production . in other words",
    ", the matter - curvature coupling generates an irreversible flow from the gravitational field to created matter constituents and the second law of thermodynamics requires that geometric curvature transforms into matter ( check @xcite ) .    in @xmath11 theory , the functional form @xmath68l_m$ ] , with @xmath69 and @xmath70 being arbitrary functions of @xmath7 , was considered in the study of gravitationally induced particle creation @xcite . recalling the argumentations above , it is clear that such a model indeed predicts a coupling of matter and geometry , through the product @xmath71 , justifying , at a theoretical level , a scenario with matter creation .",
    "such a coupling shall be prevented when @xmath26 .",
    "departing from the case in ref.@xcite , the functional form used in the present article , @xmath19 , does not predict a matter - geometry coupling ( recall that there is no product between material terms , proportional to @xmath8 , and geometrical terms , proportional to @xmath7 ) , thus there is no mechanism able to explain geometric curvature transforming into matter .",
    "therefore when there is no coupling between matter and geometry , as in the @xmath19 theory , one is capable of escaping the argument of creation of matter in the universe through the approach above , which is worth since so far there is no observational evidences of such a phenomenon .",
    "there is plenty of motivations for the search of alternative cosmological models nowadays . that happens because , although @xmath6cdm cosmological model is able to provide a good agreement between theoretical predictions and observations , it is surrounded by shortcomings and drawbacks ( check @xcite ) . in this article",
    "we have approached the @xmath0 theory of gravity from a cosmological perspective , proposing a form of surpassing the non - conservation of memt , which is originally predicted in such an alternative theory .",
    "our proposal was to establish an alternative form of treating the eemt of @xmath19 gravity , by distinguishing the presence of a fluid described by eq.([eqn : hemt2 ] ) .",
    "such an establishment implies the continuity equations ( [ eqn : hemt8])-([eqn : hemt9 ] ) .",
    "the integration of eq.([eqn : hemt12 ] ) has revealed the presence of smf permeating the universe along with the usual pf described by eq.([eqn : hemt10 ] ) .",
    "note that two - fluid cosmological models have been proposed for a long time in the literature @xcite . for recent references on this regard , check @xcite .",
    "even three - fluid cosmological models have already been constructed @xcite .",
    "recall that as argued by the @xmath0 gravity authors , the motivation to insert a function of @xmath8 in the gravitational part of the action lies on the consideration of exotic or imperfect fluids which are usually neglected in gr or @xmath3 gravity . in this way , the rising of smf predicted by the integration of eq.([eqn : hemt12 ] ) is not surprising .",
    "moreover , recall that smf existence was already predicted by @xmath0 models in @xcite and also in @xcite .    from our approach , besides predicting the existence of smf , we could evade the memt non - conservation in @xmath0 gravity .",
    "the main motivation to such an evasion is the lack of observational evidences of particle creation in cosmological scales .",
    "one might wonder if the memt non - conservation evasion of the present approach conflicts with the original predictions of @xmath0 gravity .",
    "the answer is no . in this article",
    "we have shown that when there is no product between @xmath14 and @xmath7 , namely when there is no matter - geometry coupling , one is able to break the eemt of @xmath0 cosmology in two terms .",
    "then , by applying the bianchi identities only , we have shown that both conserve .",
    "it is worth quoting here that in @xmath0 gravity , departing from @xmath11 models , there is no product between @xmath3 ( or simply @xmath7 , as in our case ) and @xmath12 .",
    "this can be checked by recalling eq.([eqn : frt1 ] ) , where the sum of the matter action ( proportional to @xmath12 ) to the gravitational action ( proportional to @xmath0 ) is explicit .",
    "cosmologically , the present model has shown to be very healthy and well - behaved .",
    "our cosmological solutions have been constructed from the scale factor of eq.([as6 ] ) , which was obtained from the method presented in section [ sec : ns ] .",
    "fig.[fig1 ] shows the time evolution of the scale factor for different values of @xmath20 .",
    "we can see that the ( yellow ) dashed curve , with @xmath58 departs significantly from the other curves .",
    "the implications of that feature are discussed some paragraphs below .",
    "fig.[fig2 ] shows the time evolution of the hubble parameter @xmath60 for different values of @xmath20 .",
    "the curves plotted for the hubble parameter are cosmologically healthy for the following reasons : firstly , independently of the value of @xmath20 , the hubble parameter always assume only positive values , which is in agreement with an expanding universe ; secondly , in standard cosmology it is well known that the hubble parameter evolves as @xmath72 , with @xmath73 being the hubble time .",
    "such a standard behaviour is being recovered in the present approach , as one can see in fig.[fig2 ] above .",
    "the present model is also able to predict the current accelerated expansion of the universe since it predicts negative values of the deceleration parameter @xmath74 for most of the values considered by us for @xmath20 ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) .",
    "in fact , in order to obtain @xmath63 , @xmath20 just needs to obey one of the constrains ( [ hd1])-([hd3 ] ) , and @xmath58 , which represents the departing curve of the scale factor in fig.[fig1 ] , does not respect any of those .",
    "fig.[fig3 ] depicts the time evolution of the sm density , represented by a ( green ) dotted - curve , of the ordinary pf density , represented by a ( blue ) thin solid line , and of the effective density , represented by a ( red ) thick solid line .",
    "it predicts the existence of smf prior to the usual pf . as quoted in section [ sec : asm ] , some early universe models indicate that there may have existed a phase prior to the radiation - dominated era in which our universe dynamics was dominated by a fluid with eos @xmath67 .",
    "such an indication is corroborated by fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "smf density tends to @xmath75 as time passes by .",
    "the low , but non - null , sm density contribution for high values of time may be related with the presence of neutron stars and even other compact astrophysical objects in the universe , which can have sm in their core ( check @xcite and also @xcite ) .",
    "to finish , we would like to point that in fig.[fig4 ] , the pressure of the ordinary pf assumes a null value long before the sm and effective pressures do ( note that the ( blue ) thin and ( red ) thick lines tends asymptotically to @xmath75 ) . on this regard ,",
    "it is worth mentioning that after the radiation - dominated era , the dynamics of the universe became dominated by dark matter ( dm ) @xcite .",
    "the nature of dm is still unknown , but in @xmath6cdm cosmological model , it is modeled as a pressureless fluid , i.e. , a fluid with @xmath76 .",
    "such a modeling is appropriate when considering dm to be made of weakly interacting massive particles ( usually known as wimps ) with mass in the gev - tev range @xcite .      in @xmath6cdm model ,",
    "the present eos of the pf reads @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "this happens because in order to theoretically predict the cosmic acceleration in standard cosmology , one invokes the cc , which is physically interpreted as an exotic fluid with negative pressure ( which would cause the acceleration of the universe expansion ) . on the other hand , we did not invoke the cc in the present model . since anyhow we have obtained an accelerated expansion of the universe ( @xmath63 ) , we can infer that in this model such a phenomenon occurs as a consequence of the consideration of terms proportional to @xmath8 in the gravitational part of the action and consequently in the field equations .",
    "in other words , not only the presence of extra geometrical terms in the gravitational part of the action can account for the cosmic acceleration , as shown in several @xmath3 models , such as @xcite , but also the consideration of extra material terms .",
