    "quantum turbulence is one of the most important issues in low temperature physics and has been studied theoretically and experimentally for thermal counterflow where superfluid and normal fluid flow oppositely . in recent years , experiments of coflow where superfluid and normal fluid flow in the same direction are performed to observe different features from thermal counterflow @xcite .",
    "for example , the vortex line density is proportional to the 3/2 power of the velocity and independent of temperature .",
    "the motivation of the present paper is to find numerically some behavior of vortices characteristic of coflow .",
    "according to the two - fluid model , superfluid @xmath3he at a finite temperature consists of an intimate mixture of a viscous normal fluid component ( density @xmath4 and velocity @xmath1 ) and an inviscid superfluid components ( density @xmath5 and velocity @xmath0 ) @xcite .",
    "in superfluid @xmath3he the circulation of a superfluid vortex , called a quantized vortex , is quantized by the quantum circulation @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is planck s constant and @xmath8 is the mass of a @xmath3he atom .",
    "quantum turbulence generally occurs by tangling of quantized vortices @xcite .",
    "we perform numerical simulation for coflow in a square channel ; superfluid velocity is prescribed to be uniform flow and normal fluid velocity to be hagen - poiseuille flow .",
    "vortices are distributed inhomogeneously and like to accumulate through the mutual friction on the surface of a cylinder where superfluid velocity equals normal fluid velocity . as a result ,",
    "the vortex configuration becomes degenerate from three - dimensional to two - dimensional .",
    "how strongly the vortices accumulate depends on temperature and the averaged velocity .",
    "the contents of this paper are as follows . in sec .",

    "[ sec:1 ] , we show the results for coflow .",
    "section  [ sec:3 ] is devoted to the conclusion and the future work .",
    "we perform numerical simulation by using the vortex filament model with the full biot - savart law @xcite .",
    "a point @xmath9 on the vortex filament is represented in a parametric form @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is time and @xmath12 is the one - dimensional coordinate along the filament .",
    "the equation of motion of @xmath9 is given by @xmath13,\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the temperature - dependent mutual friction coefficients , and the prime denotes derivatives of @xmath9 with respect to @xmath12 .",
    "the first term of the right - hand side of eq.(1 ) is superfluid velocity , given by @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the velocity field caused by vortex filaments , @xmath18 the boundary induced field , @xmath19 the applied uniform velocity field .",
    "the velocity field @xmath17 is represented by the biot - savart law @xmath20 where @xmath21 refers to a point on the vortex filament and the integration is performed along the vortex filaments .",
    "the velocity field @xmath17 is obtained by a simple procedure ; it is just the field produced by an image vortex that is constructed by reflecting the filament into the surface and reversing its direction .",
    "the second and third terms of the right - hand side of eq.(1 ) are caused by mutual friction .",
    "the second term makes a vortex balloon out or collapse inward . as discussed in @xcite",

    "when the local radius @xmath25 at a point on the vortex is smaller than @xmath24 , the vortex shrinks locally , while the vortex balloons out when @xmath26 .",
    "we prescribe the hagen - poiseuille profile @xmath27 for @xmath1 , though the normal fluid flow in the experiment @xcite may be actually turbulent . when the normal fluid flows along the @xmath28 direction , the @xmath28 component of @xmath1 is given by @xmath29\\frac{\\cos(m\\pi y/2a)}{m^3},\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is a normalization factor and @xmath31 and @xmath32",
    "are halves of the channel width along the @xmath33 and @xmath34 axes , respectively @xcite .    to characterize the development of vortices ,",
    "we introduce the vortex line density ( vld ) as @xmath35 where the integral is performed along all vortices in the sample volume @xmath36 .    in this study",
    ", our calculation is performed under the following conditions .",
    "a vortex filament is represented by a string of discreet points .",
    "the numerical space resolution , namely the minimum distance between neighboring points , is @xmath37 cm , the time resolution is @xmath38 s , and the computing box is @xmath39 @xmath40 .",
    "we consider the case of @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the spatially averaged normal fluid velocity and the spacial average of the applied superfluid velocity @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the periodic boundary conditions are used along the flow direction @xmath44 , whereas the solid boundary conditions are applied to channel walls .",
    "the effects of reconnection is artificially performed , whenever two vortices approach more closely than @xmath45 .",
    "the initial state consists of eight randomly oriented vortex rings of radius 0.023 cm ( fig.[fig:3][a ] ) .",
    "we perform numerical simulation for coflow in a square channel and find two different states of vortices , namely the diffusive state and the localized state .",
    "the features of two states are shown in the figures ; fig.[fig:1 ] shows the time development of the vld and fig.[fig:2 ] shows the snapshots of the vortices . in the diffusive state ,",
    "the vld oscillates irregularly and the vortices are diffusive ( fig.[fig:1][a ] and fig.[fig:2][a ] ) . in the localized state ,",

    "some small vortex loops are made by reconnections and balloon out to a localized region .",
    "then , the vld increases rapidly . in the second ( fig.[fig:3][d ] ) , the vortices protruding from the localized region towards the walls continue to extend and wrap the localized region .",
    "since the reconnections seldom occur in this stage , the vld increases much slower than that of the first stage .",
    "the vortex distribution of coflow is different from that of nonuniform thermal counterflow @xcite .",
    "this is because that the coflow has the region where the mutual friction dose not work . to see where the vortices accumulate , we consider the localized induction approximation ( lia ) .",
    "then , the second term of the right - hand side of eq.(1 ) is @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the quantity proportional to the quantum circulation @xcite .",
    "the mutual friction does not work in the region where @xmath55 vanishes .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , if the term @xmath56 is negligible , the region is like a square pipe as shown by the square dots in fig.[fig:10 ] .",
    "however , this region is modified to the round dots by the term @xmath56 ; the position around a corner is shifted inward because the radius of curvature is small and the position around a side is shifted outward because that is large .          whether the vortices are localized or diffusive depends on the parameters .",
    "we introduce a dimensionless variable @xmath57 to characterize the behavior of the vortices ; @xmath58 here @xmath59 is obtained by the integration along all vortices @xmath60 in the cylindrical region of the radius @xmath61 cm whose central axis is along that of the pipe and , @xmath62 is obtained by the integration along all other vortices @xmath63 . the time development of @xmath57 is shown in fig.[fig:4][a ] .",
    "we define that the vortices are localized when @xmath57 exceeds 5 after the time passes sufficiently , and that the vortices are diffusive when @xmath57 is less than 5 .",
    "the value of @xmath57 depends strongly on temperature and the averaged velocity @xmath64 , and the resulting phase diagram is shown in fig.[fig:4][b ] .",
    "the vortices like to be localized for higher temperature and faster velocity , and diffusive for lower temperature and slower velocity .",
    "mutual friction depends on temperature and velocity , because the coefficient @xmath14 is dependent on temperature and increasing the velocity makes the relative velocity faster everywhere .",
    "if temperature is lower and velocity is slower , the velocity caused by mutual friction is dominated by the self - induced velocity @xmath56 and the vortices almost move freely . consequently , whether the vortices are localized or diffusive depends on temperature and the velocity .    :",
    "the time development of dimensionless quantity @xmath65 , [ b ] : its dependence on temperature and the velocity . in [ a ] , the round dots are for @xmath66 k and @xmath42 = 0.6 cm / s , the square dots are for @xmath67 k and @xmath42 = 1.0 cm / s ( color online),scaledwidth=97.0% ]",
    "we found that the vortex development of coflow has two states ; one is diffusive and the other is localized . at the localized state ,",
    "the vortices accumulate on the surface of cylinder where the mutual friction does not work . whether the vortices are localized or diffusive depends on temperature and the averaged velocity .",
    "the future work is to perform a numerical simulation of coflow under turbulent normal fluid flow . in the experiment @xcite",
