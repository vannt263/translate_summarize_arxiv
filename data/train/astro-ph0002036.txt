    "merging is a fundamental mode of stellar mass addition to galaxies . moreover ,",
    "merging brings in new gas and creates gravitational disturbances that enhance star formation or fuel a nuclear black hole",
    ". the general process of substructure infall may be the rate fixing process for the buildup of a galaxy s stars and consequently may largely regulate its luminosity history .",
    "gravitational forces on relatively large scales dominate merger dynamics which allows direct observation of the mechanism , although with the considerable complication that dark matter dominates the mass .",
    "n - body simulations @xcite give the detailed orbital evolution , morphological disturbances and eventual outcomes of the encounters of pairs of galaxies .    the purpose of this paper",
    "is to estimate the rate of mass gain per galaxy due to mergers over the redshift zero to one interval .",
    "our primary statistic is the fractional luminosity in close kinematic pairs , which is readily related to n - body simulations and sidesteps morphological interpretation .",
    "this approach provides a clear sample definition which is closely connected to the large scale dynamics of merging . in common with",
    "all merger estimates it requires an estimate of the fraction of the pairs that will merge and a mean time to merger .",
    "the number of kinematic pairs is proportional to the volume integral at small scales of the product of two - point correlation function , @xmath15 , and the luminosity function ( lf ) .",
    "the high luminosity galaxies appear to be evolving purely in luminosity @xcite , which can be easily compensated .",
    "the measured evolution of @xmath15 suggests that the density of physical pairs should not vary much with redshift , @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this inference is in notable contrast with the pair counts or morphological typing approaches to merger estimation @xcite , which suggest that merging rate by number varies as @xmath17 .",
    "hst photometric pairs , with no redshift information leads to a dependence of @xmath18 @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we combine the caltech faint galaxy redshift survey ( cfgrs ) and the canadian network for observational cosmology field galaxy survey ( cnoc2 ) from which we construct evolution compensated , volume - limited , subsamples . in section 3",
    "we measure the fractional luminosity in 50 and 100  companions as a function of redshift .",
    "the cnoc2 sample is used in section 4 to relate this wide pair sample to a close pair sample which is more securely converted into a mass merger rate .",
    "section 5 discusses our conclusions .",
    "we use @xmath19 , @xmath20 in open and flat cosmologies .",
    "the cfgrs sample of the hdf plus flanking fields is discussed in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we use the high coverage subsample lying within a 240 arcsecond radius circle , with a center located at 12@xmath21 36@xmath22 50@xmath23 and 62@xmath24 12@xmath25 55@xmath26 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the computed magnitude selection function , @xmath27 , ( in cousins r ) is accurately approximated as a constant 90% spectroscopic completeness for @xmath28 mag with a linear decline to 19% at @xmath29 mag , our sample limit .",
    "the magnitude weight is @xmath30 .",
    "the cfgrs k - corrections and evolution compensation are here approximated as @xmath31 mag from the tables of poggianti ( 1997 ) .",
    "for galaxies that cohen et al .",
    "( 2000 ) classify as `` e '' ( emission ) , @xmath32 , `` a '' types have @xmath33 and all types have @xmath34    the cnoc2 selection weights and k - corrections are discussed in yee et al . ( 2000 ) . .",
    "the evolution of the luminosity function is approximated as a uniform @xmath35 , with @xmath36 , @xcite which we use over the entire cnoc2-cfgrs redshift range .",
    "the kinematic pair fraction is directly proportional to the mean density of the sample and is therefore sensitively dependent on correcting to a complete and uniform sample @xcite .",
    "the most straightforward approach is to impose a strict volume limit . for our primary sample we will limit the cfgrs and the cnoc2 samples at @xmath37 mag , which yields volume - limited samples of about 300 cfgrs galaxies between redshift 0.3 to 1.1 and 3000 cnoc2 galaxies between 0.1 to 0.5 .",
    "the volume density of the sample is approximately constant at @xmath38 mpc@xmath39 over the entire redshift range for @xmath40 but rises roughly as @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "both the cfgrs and the cnoc2 surveys are multiply masked , which minimizes the effects of slit crowding , however there is still a measurable pair selection function .",
    "the cnoc2 catalogue has about a 20% deficiency of close angular pairs .",
    "we model the measured angular pair selection weight as , @xmath43^{-1},$ ] where @xmath44 $ ] is @xmath45 $ ] for the cfgrs sample and @xmath46 $ ] for the cnoc2 sample with typical pair corrections being 10% .",
    "the preferred choice of pair statistic depends on the application @xcite . here",
    "we are primarily interested in the impact of merging on galaxy mass increase , for which the k - corrected , evolution compensated r luminosity is a stand - in .",
    "the rate of merging per galaxy depends on the density of galaxies in the near neighborhood and their velocity distribution . as a practical redshift space estimator ,",
    "we compute the fractional luminosity in close kinematic pairs , @xmath47 where the weights , @xmath48 , allow for the magnitude selection function .",
    "note that the @xmath49 and @xmath50 pairs are both counted .",
    "the ratio has the benefit of being fairly stable for different luminosity limits , self - normalizing for luminosity evolution , identical to a mass ratio for a fixed @xmath51 population . for an unperturbed pair luminosity function",
    "it is mathematically identical to the @xmath52 of patton ( 2000a ) although constructed out of somewhat different quantities .",
    "the two parameters , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , are chosen on the basis of merger dynamics and the characteristics of the sample .",
    "the rate of mass increase per galaxy is calculated from this statistical estimator using a knowledge of merger dynamics and the measured correlations and kinematics of galaxy pairs in the sample .",
    "the mean fractional pair luminosity , based on 18 cfgrs pairs and 91 cnoc2 pairs , with @xmath55 and @xmath56 pairs is displayed in figure  1 .",
    "these kinematic separation parameters are larger than is suitable for reliably identifying `` soon - to - merge '' pairs .",
    "however , they provide a statistically robust connection to those pairs and take into account the lower velocity precision and sample size of the cfgrs relative to cnoc2 .",
    "the errors are computed from the pair counts , @xmath57 .",
    "the measurements of @xmath58 in figure  1 are fit to @xmath2 , finding @xmath3 $ ] of @xmath4 $ ] for @xmath59 pairs and @xmath5 $ ] for @xmath60 , both for @xmath1 .",
    "the increase with @xmath61 of @xmath62 is consistent with a @xmath63 two - point correlation function . if @xmath64 , then @xmath8 at 100  rises by about 0.05 whereas if @xmath65 , then @xmath66 .",
    "the increase is largely as a result of the rise in the implied co - moving sample density over this redshift range .",
    "the merger probability of a kinematic pair depends sensitively on the pairwise velocity dispersion , @xmath67 , of galaxies .",
    "the model pairwise velocity distribution is computed as the convolution of the correlation function with the distribution of random velocities .",
    "the infall velocities are negligible at these small separations and we will assume that the peculiar velocities are drawn from a gaussian distribution .",
    "the measured fraction of the cnoc2 pair sample with velocities smaller than some @xmath68 , normalized to the value at 1000 , is displayed in figure  2 .",
    "the 50  wide pairs limited at @xmath69 mag are plotted as open squares , the 20  pairs limited at @xmath70 and @xmath69 mag are plotted as octagons and diamonds , respectively .",
    "the upper curve assumes that @xmath67 is 200 and the lower one 300 , which approximately span the data .",
    "the merger rate is best estimated from very close kinematic pairs , 20  or less , about half of which are physically close and have significant morphological disturbance @xcite .",
    "however the fraction of galaxies in such close pairs is about one percent , giving poor statistics .",
    "since the number of pairs increases smoothly as @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the slope of the small scale correlation function , we can use pairs at somewhat larger separations as statistically representative of the close pairs , however we prefer to stay within the radius of virialized material around a galaxy over our redshift range , which is no larger than about 100 . the mass accretion rate from major mergers is therefore estimated as , @xmath73 where the factor of one half allows for the double counting of pairs , @xmath74 converts from redshift space to real space pairs , f gives the fraction of the pairs that will merge in the next @xmath75 ( the `` last orbit '' in - spiral time from @xmath61 ) and @xmath76 is the mean incoming mass as estimated assuming a constant m / l .",
    "for the relatively massive galaxies considered here the dynamical friction is so strong that it is more violent relaxation with little timescale dependence on the masses .",
    "the measured ratio of the numbers of 50 and 100  pairs to 20  pairs in the cnoc2 sample is @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively , in accord with the expectation of a growth as @xmath79 with the inner cutoff of 5 .",
    "not all kinematic pairs are close in physical space .",
    "the relation between the kinematic pairs closer than @xmath61 and @xmath68 and pairs with a 3d physical distance @xmath61 is readily evaluated by integrating the velocity convolved correlation function over velocity and projected radius and ratioing to the 3d integral of the correlation function .",
    "we find that @xmath80 for @xmath81 and @xmath63 there is support for this value on the basis of morphological classification , as tested in patton et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , where about half of the kinematic pairs exhibited strong tidal features .",
    "the fraction of physically close pairs that are at sufficiently low velocity to merge is a key part of the rate calculation .",
    "it is clear that many galaxies will have close encounters which do not lead to immediate mergers , although mergers could of course occur on subsequent orbital passages .",
    "the key quantity that we need is the ratio of the critical velocity to merge , @xmath82 , to @xmath67 .",
    "the timescale for close pairs to merge is much shorter than the time over which morphological disturbances are clearly evident , by nearly an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "this is one of our reasons for preferring kinematic pairs as a merger estimator .",
    "the simulation results indicate that the time to merge is , on the average , roughly that of a `` half - circle '' orbit , which at @xmath61 of 20  at a velocity of 200  is close to 0.3 gyr",
    ". a straight - line orbit with instantaneous merging would merge in about 0.1 gyr , although that is not likely to be representative .    to compute the merger probability , @xmath83",
    ", we need to know the maximal velocity to merge , @xmath82 , at a physical separation of 20  for a typical @xmath14 galaxy .",
    "a not very useful lower bound is fixed by the keplerian escape velocity at 20 , @xmath84 , where the circular velocity is approximately 200 .",
    "an upper bound to @xmath82 is the velocity that an object would have if it is captured into a galaxy s extended dark halo at the virialization radius and orbits to 20  with no dynamical friction .",
    "the virialization radius is approximately at the radius where the mean interior overdensity is @xmath85 , implying @xmath86 , or , about 200  for our typical galaxy .",
    "the largest possible apogalactic velocity at @xmath87 is @xmath88 , which leads to an undissipated velocity at 20  of @xmath89 . using @xmath90 at 20",
    ", we find that the fraction of all physical pairs that merge in one @xmath75 is about 0.40(0.16 ) .",
    "therefore , we will normalize to a merger probability of 0.3 , noting the 50% or so uncertainty .",
    "the absolute magnitude limit of @xmath91 mag corresponds to @xmath92 which contains about 58% of the luminosity for the mean cnoc2 lf , @xmath93 and @xmath94 . to make our merger rate inclusive of major mergers we normalize to @xmath95 , which includes 85% of the luminosity . within the current statistical accuracy",
    ", the paired and field galaxies have identical lfs . on the basis of n - body experiments @xcite galaxies with masses greater than about @xmath96 will merge in approximately one orbital time .    on the basis of these considerations",
    "we find that the rate of mass accumulation of galaxies with luminosities of @xmath96 and above is , @xmath97 where we have adopted the 100  @xmath8 value for a flat , low density cosmology and explicitly assumed that the velocity and timescale factors do not vary over this redshift range , as expected at these small scales in a low @xmath98 universe",
    "there is direct evidence that once evolution compensated that the luminous galaxies retain have no evolution in their circular velocities @xcite .",
    "our main observational result is that for galaxies with @xmath99 mag , the fraction of galaxy luminosity in 50wide kinematic pairs is about 14% , with no noticeable redshift dependence over the redshift zero to one range .",
    "this implies an integrated mass accretion rate of about 2% of @xmath100 per gyr per galaxy for merging galaxies having @xmath95 .",
    "our rate is uncertain at about the factor of two level due to uncertainty in the dynamical details of merging for our sample definitions .",
    "this merger rate implies a 15% mass increase in an @xmath14 galaxy since redshift one .",
    "if the correlations of lower luminosity galaxies are only somewhat weaker than these @xcite then the same @xmath12 merged - in mass causes a 50% mass increase in a 0.3@xmath14 galaxy .",
    "there are several issues that require further investigation .",
    "first , the rate of merging of similarly selected kinematic pairs should be studied in appropriately matched n - body experiments to better determine the orbital timescales .",
    "second , the absence of a redshift dependence of @xmath67 and @xmath82 needs to be observationally checked .",
    "third , the connection between close kinematic pairs and morphologically disturbed galaxies , which does conform to the kinematic pair predictions at low redshift @xcite , needs to be better understood at high redshift .",
