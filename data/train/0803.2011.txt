    "the properties of underdoped yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) have been studied intensively within the efforts to unravel the mechanism of high temperature superconductivity .",
    "the ortho  ii phase , corresponding to oxygen content @xmath14 and characterized by alternating full and empty chains , has attracted particular attention as it is both underdoped and free of disorder .",
    "although the existence of this phase has been documented experimentally in considerable number of reports , it has also been established that as a rule the ortho  ii domains coexists with domains of different oxygen ordering or / and strong disorder even in the case @xmath15 .",
    "an improved procedure developed by liang at al.@xcite has made possible preparation of twin free , highly ordered ortho  ii single crystals .",
    "such crystals have recently been used in several studies of specific properties of the ortho  ii phase by means of neutron scattering@xcite , x - ray diffraction@xcite , time - resolved spectroscopy@xcite , infrared spectroscopy@xcite , nuclear magnetic resonance@xcite , microwave spectroscopy@xcite , and resistance measurements in high magnetic fields.@xcite .",
    "there have been several attempts to identify the raman modes of the ortho - ii phase by measuring the spectra of oxygen deficient yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath12 ( @xmath16 ) single crystals.@xcite compared to the well known raman spectra of ortho - i ( @xmath17 ) and t ( @xmath18 ) phases , in the case of ortho - ii one expects shift of the corresponding raman modes and activation of additional modes due to the doubling of the unit cell .",
    "a significant number of additional modes have been observed , but their identification has met definite difficulties due to ambiguities in the local structure of yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath12 even in the case @xmath19 . indeed , in the idealized ortho - i , ortho - ii and t structures the cu1 and o1 atoms in the basal cu - o planes are at centrosymmetrical sites and their vibrations are not raman active .",
    "the oxygen arrangement in the basal planes of a real yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath12 material , however , is characterized by chain fragments instead of infinite chains and part of oxygen atoms are outside the chains in otherwise vacant o5 sites .",
    "this creates a number of local non - centrosymmetrical surroundings for cu and o atom , in particular those at the end of chain fragments , and activates their vibrations in the raman spectrum.@xcite some of these defects can also be produced by local laser annealing@xcite or photoactivation.@xcite another issue , as a rule neglected but of particular importance in the case of ortho - ii phase , is the possible lack of correspondence between the oxygen content and arrangement in the volume of the crystal and its surface layer(s ) , where the raman scattering occurs .",
    "the cause for such discrepancy is the in- and out - diffusion of oxygen , which depends strongly on the type of the surface ( @xmath0 , @xmath2 or @xmath1 ) , starting oxygen content , ambient oxygen pressure , temperature and exposure time.@xcite    in this paper we present results of a temperature - dependent raman study on freshly - cleaved @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 surfaces of a twin free yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 ( ybco6.5 ) single crystal with high degree of ortho - ii type ordering .",
    "this allowed us with great certainty to identify the proper raman modes of the ortho - ii phase and assign them to definite atomic motions via close comparison with predictions of lattice dynamical calculations , as well as to measure the symmetry and strength of electronic scattering .",
    "we used a high quality mechanically de - twinned ortho - ii ybco6.5 single crystal with @xmath6=57.5  k and @xmath20 , grown by a flux method in bazro3 crucible.@xcite immediately before mounting the sample on the cold finger of a microstat@xmath21he ( oxford instruments ) optical cryostat , a small area of the surface ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , or @xmath2 ) to be used for raman measurements was cleaved out to ensure that the scattering volume has an ortho - ii oxygen arrangement .",
    "the raman spectra were measured under microscope ( @xmath22 magnification ) using a triple t64000 ( horiba jobin yvon ) spectrometer . in most experiments we used 633  nm excitation with less than 1  mw incident laser power focused at a spot of 2 - 3  @xmath23 m diameter .",
    "comparative measurements with 515 , 488 , and 458  nm excitations were also done .",
    "all spectra were corrected for the bose factor . for description of the scattering configurations we use the porto s notation @xmath24 , where the first and fourth letters denote , respectively , the directions of incident and scattered light in a cartesian @xmath25 system with axes along the crystallographic directions .",
    "the polarization of the incident and scattered light is given by the second and third letters , respectively .",
    "in figure 1 are compared the raman spectra obtained with 633  nm excitation at room temperature from freshly cleaved and aged areas on the @xmath0 and @xmath2 surfaces of the same ortho - ii crystal . the spectral shapes and raman line frequencies from aged surfaces are consistent with those from earlier reports on the @xmath26 and @xmath27 spectra of twinned ybco6.5@xcite and ybco@xmath28 ( @xmath29 samples.@xcite the corresponding spectra from freshly cleaved and aged surfaces , however , exhibit definite differences in the positions and appearance of some of the peaks .",

    "the atomic displacements of the eleven @xmath8 modes , as predicted by lattice dynamical calculations , ( ldc)@xcite are shown in figure 3 . for most modes , the experimentally observed frequencies ( at 90  k ) are in good agreement with those predicted by ldc , shown in parenthesis .",
    "in addition to the five @xmath8 modes at 126 , 147 , 342 , 447 , and 487  @xmath32 corresponding to displacements along the @xmath33-axis of ba , cu2 , o2-o3 , o2+o3 , o4 in the ortho - i structure , there are six more @xmath8 modes in the extended ortho - ii cell .",
    "four of them can be positively identified at 107  @xmath32 [ cu2(@xmath34)-cu2(@xmath35 ) out - of - phase ] , 171  @xmath32 [ y(@xmath28 ) ] , 352  @xmath32 [ o4(@xmath34)-o4(@xmath35 ) out - of - phase ] , and 579  @xmath32 [ o2(@xmath28 ) ] .",
    "the mixed ba / cu mode , predicted at 146  @xmath32 , may be very weak and not observable .",
    "the weak raman line at 381  @xmath32 can be tentatively assigned to the mode involving mainly o4 displacements along @xmath33 , with a predicted frequency of 414  @xmath32 . in the @xmath27",
    "spectra one observes additional lines of @xmath8 character at 224 and 601  @xmath32 .",
    "these positions are close to those of defect modes related to displacements of cu1 and o1 at the end of broken chains,@xcite which could preexist or be created by photoactivation in our ortho - ii sample .",

    "the closest @xmath9 ( 200 and 213  @xmath32 ) and @xmath10 ( 300  @xmath32 ) frequencies predicted by ldc , correspond to modes involving mainly displacements of o4 and o4 along @xmath38 and @xmath39 directions , respectively .    a more careful look at the appearance of the apex oxygen mode near 487  @xmath32 in the @xmath40 and @xmath41 spectra of fig .",
    "2 reveals a significantly different behavior compared to that in the corresponding spectra of the ortho - i phase . indeed , with these scattering configurations , the intensity of an @xmath8 raman line is proportional to @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are diagonal elements of the corresponding raman tensors .",
    "negligible intensity in the @xmath40 spectra may be expected if @xmath46 , which in the ortho - i phase is satisfied only for the out - of - phase o2-o3 mode at @xmath47  @xmath32 , but not for the apex oxygen mode near 500  @xmath32 ( seen in the @xmath40 but not in the @xmath41 spectrum ) .",
    "here , for the ortho - ii phase the apex oxygen mode has an appearance similar to that of the out - of - phase mode : it is practically not seen in the @xmath40 spectrum , but well pronounced in the @xmath41 spectrum with an intensity comparable to that in the @xmath48 and @xmath49 spectra .",
    "this allows us to conclude that for the apex oxygen mode of the ortho - ii phase , the relation @xmath50 is satisfied .",
    "in addition to discrete phonon lines , the raman spectra of ortho - ii phase contain structureless background with intensity stronger with @xmath49 than with @xmath48 , and negligible intensity with @xmath27 polarization ( fig.4 ) .",
    "such background scattering , observed in the normal and superconducting states of high @xmath6 superconductors has been attributed to electronic scattering and has been intensively studied both experimentally and theoretically.@xcite it has been shown that for optimally doped ybco the electronic scattering is practically independent of temperature for @xmath51 . with the opening of a superconducting gap @xmath52 at @xmath53 , there is a redistribution of electronic scattering intensity from lower to higher energies and a maximum associated with pair - breaking is formed at @xmath54 . for underdoped ybco a slight decrease of electronic scattering intensity at @xmath55  @xmath32 has been observed below a characteristic temperature @xmath56 well above @xmath6 and this has been considered a manifestation of a pseudogap opening.@xcite there are to our knowledge no reports on the variation of electronic scattering near @xmath56 .    with few exceptions,@xcite in experimental studies of the electronic scattering in ybco ,",
    "twinned samples have been used and the theoretical models are based on the tetragonal approximation for the crystal structure .    ,",

    "4 and 5 illustrate that the electronic scattering from the @xmath0 surface of the ortho - ii crystal is strongly anisotropic and temperature dependent below 600  @xmath32 .",
    "its intensity in the @xmath57 spectra is stronger by a factor 2 than in the @xmath60 and much stronger than in the @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 spectra .",
    "we attribute the stronger electronic raman intensity for @xmath49 polarization to the additional scattering channels involving two cuo@xmath3 planar and a cuo chain bands crossing the fermi surface along the @xmath65 - @xmath66 direction@xcite in the brillouin zone .     and @xmath57 spectra of ortho - ii between 260 and 80  k.,width=302 ]    the coupling of the phonons to the electronic excitations contributing to the raman background is manifested in our spectra by the asymmetric fano profile of some of the @xmath8 phonon lines , most clearly pronounced for these near 118  @xmath32(ba ) , 168  @xmath32 ( y ) and 486  @xmath32 ( apex oxygen ) , which interestingly include mainly motions of atoms not belonging to the cu - o planes . for a phonon coupled to an electronic background the fano profile @xmath67",
    "is generally used to describe the line shape , where @xmath68 , @xmath69 is the renormalized phonon frequency that includes all contributions resulting from the interaction of the phonon with elementary excitations , @xmath70 is the linewidth , @xmath71 is the asymmetry parameter , and @xmath72 is the non - interacting with the phonon part of the electronic excitations continuum . in the case of real phonon and electronic scattering amplitudes @xmath73 and @xmath74 , and a flat scattering background around the phonon frequency @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the density of electronic excitations coupled to the particular phonon ,",
    "@xmath77 is the related electron - phonon coupling constant , and the intensity of the interacting with the phonon part of the electronic continuum in eq.(1 ) can be expressed as @xmath78 . under the reasonable assumption that @xmath74 , @xmath73 , and @xmath77 are only weakly dependent on @xmath79 , the variations with temperature of the absolute value of @xmath80 and @xmath81 will be governed mainly by @xmath82 .",
    "6 shows in more detail the variations between 260 and 80  k of profile of the raman line near 485  @xmath32 , which corresponds to the apex oxygen @xmath8 mode .",
    "in contrast to the known results for twin free ortho - i crystals , the slopes of fano shaped profiles in the @xmath48 and @xmath49 spectra of ortho - ii are of opposite sign , which is not surprising if we take into account that @xmath83 and @xmath84 are of opposite sign for this mode . it is also evident from fig . 6",
    "that the raman lines become more symmetric at lower temperature .",
    "the fano fit of the experimental profiles showed that the @xmath80 factor for the @xmath48 and @xmath49 decreases , respectively , from -0.6 and + 0.8 at 300  k to -0.2 and + 0.1 at 80  k. on the other hand , the electronic background @xmath85 remains nearly constant between 300 and 200  k but with further cooling decreases significantly between 200 and 100  k ( fig.5 ) .",
    "on the basis of considerations above concerning @xmath86 and @xmath87 being governed by @xmath82 , one therefore concludes that with decreasing temperature the density of electronic excitations coupled to this phonon also decreases , concurrently to the decrease of the electronic background @xmath85 already noticed .",
    "such a temperature behavior of the electronic raman scattering is most consistent with an opening of a gap in the electronic excitations as the pseudogap in the underdoped high temperature superconductors.@xcite it is worth noting here that the characteristic temperature t@xmath88  k , below which opel at al.@xcite have observed weak spectral weight loss in the @xmath61 spectra of twinned films of yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 ( t@xmath89  k ) , is in the same temperature range .     of the profile of the raman line associated with @xmath8 apex oxygen mode.,width=226 ]",
    "the experimental results reported here strongly suggest that some of the previous raman scattering data@xcite obtained from aged twinned surfaces of ybco@xmath12 ( @xmath90 ) samples may not be representative of the ordered ortho - ii structure .",
    "this study provides more reliable data for identification of the ortho - ii raman modes , as well as information on the variation of electronic scattering and electron - phonon interactions in the temperature range where opening of a pseudogap has been claimed .",
