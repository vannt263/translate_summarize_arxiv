    "stochastic partial differential equations are widely used in modeling different phenomena involving randomness , and the area of their application is constantly increasing . this is reflected by increasing number of works devoted to such equations . vast majority of these articles is devoted to the case where the underlying noise is gaussian . in particular , a stochastic wave equation with gaussian noise was studied in @xcite , to mention only a few authors . however ,",
    "many phenomena are characterized by heavy tails of the corresponding distributions ; often not only variances , but also expectations of underlying random variables are infinite . in such cases ,",
    "the underlying random noise is better modeled by a stable distribution .    in this paper , we study a wave equation in the plane , where the random source has a stable distribution .",
    "we prove that a candidate solution to the equation , constructed by means of poisson s formula , is a generalized solution .",
    "we also show that it is hlder continuous is time variable , but it is irregular in the spatial variable .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : prelim ] contains the notation and auxiliary information on objects involved . in section  [ sec : main ] , we introduce the main object of the paper , a planar wave equation with stable noise , and establish main results . the existence and spatial properties of a candidate solution to the equation , constructed via poisson s formula ,",
    "are studied in section  [ subsec : existence ] . in section  [ subsec : generalized ] , we prove that the candidate solution is a generalized solution to the equation .",
    "finally , in section  [ subsec : holder ] , we establish the hlder regularity of the solution in the time variable .",
    "throughout the article , the symbol @xmath6 denotes a generic constant , the exact value of which is not important and may change from line to line .",
    "similarly , @xmath7 is be used to denote a generic a.s .  finite random variable .",
    "we use the notation @xmath8 both for the absolute value of a real number and for the euclidean norm of a vector ; the particular meaning will be always clear from the context .",
    "the euclidean ball @xmath9 is denoted by @xmath10 . finally , @xmath11 .      in this section",
    ", we give essential information on symmetric @xmath12-stable s@xmath2s  random variables and measures ; for details , we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "let @xmath13 be a complete probability space .",

    "s@xmath2s  random variables and fields are often constructed by means of an  independently scattered s@xmath2s  random measure , which is defined as follows . denoting by @xmath21 the family of borel sets of finite lebesgue measure , a random set function @xmath22",
    "is called an independently scattered s@xmath2srandom measure with lebesgue control measure if    1 .   for any @xmath23 ,",

    ", the integral @xmath34 is defined as the limit in probability of integrals of simple compactly supported functions ; its value is an s@xmath2s  random variable with @xmath35    our analysis is based on the lepage series representation of @xmath36 defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath37 be an arbitrary continuous positive probability density function on @xmath38 , and @xmath39 be three independent families of random variables satisfying :    * @xmath40 , is a sequence of arrivals of a poisson process with unit intensity ; * @xmath41 , are independent random vectors in @xmath38 with density @xmath37 ; * @xmath42 , are independent centered gaussian variables with @xmath43=1 $ ] .",
    "then @xmath36 ( as a random process indexed by finite measure borel sets ) has the same finite - dimensional distributions as @xmath44 where @xmath45 ; the corresponding series converges almost surely for any borel set @xmath46 of finite lebesgue measure .",
    "moreover , for any @xmath47 , the vector @xmath48 has the same distribution as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 throughout the paper , we work with a planar s@xmath2s  measure @xmath36 , that is ,  we consider the case @xmath51 .",

    "for a positive constant @xmath60 , consider the planar wave equation @xmath61 with zero initial conditions . the random source is a product of a continuous function @xmath3 and s@xmath2s  white noise @xmath62 , which is a formal derivative of a planar s@xmath2s  random measure @xmath36 introduced in the previous section .",
    "the precise meaning of this equality is not immediately obvious .",
    "clearly , there can be no classical ( belonging to @xmath63 solution to this equation , so we will look at generalized solutions .",
