    "the excitation of a single nucleon to a @xmath0 isobar yields an effective @xmath10 force with components of fujita - miyazawa type @xcite and much richer structures in a reducible form ; beside pion @xmath14 exchange , the @xmath10 force has contributions of shorter range due to the exchange of heavier mesons . in the @xmath9 system",
    "an effective @xmath9 force arises that also has parts of shorter range than @xmath15 exchange .",
    "the paper introduces the dynamics chosen for the extended description of the @xmath9 system in section  [ sec : dyn ] .",

    "conclusions are given in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "the description of the @xmath9 system is given in a hilbert space consisting of two sectors as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : hs ] ; the first sector @xmath16 is purely nucleonic , and in the second sector @xmath17 one nucleon is replaced by a @xmath0 isobar of mass @xmath18 mev .",
    "the restriction to hilbert sectors with one @xmath0 at most has a strong physics motivation .",
    "the single @xmath0 isobar , when coupled to explicit pion - nucleon states , mediates the @xmath19 resonance in pion - nucleon scattering ; it also mediates single - pion production in @xmath11 scattering where single - pion production is the dominant inelastic channel up to about 500 mev in the @xmath11 center of mass ( c.m . ) system , i.e. , far beyond the two - pion threshold .",
    "thus , the adopted hilbert space is sufficient for a further extension to the intermediate - energy pionic channels where a hilbert sector with two pions appears to be dynamically suppressed .",
    "the nucleons in the sector @xmath16 are fully antisymmetrized .",
    "the sector @xmath17 does not has a physics life on its own , but is included only through its coupling to @xmath16 .",
    "that coupling is symmetric in all nucleons .",
    "though the @xmath0 isobar is physically distinct from the nucleons , only wave - function components , antisymmetrized in all four baryons , nucleons and the @xmath0 isobar , have to be considered .",

    "[ fig:3nfho ] , in which all four baryons are involved in the interaction process .",
    "but @xmath37 is also the source for the effective @xmath9 force , whose corresponding lowest order contributions are shown in fig .",

    "the clean elimination of the @xmath9 force is achieved by using the full @xmath37 component in the calculation of @xmath38 , but the modified part @xmath39 when the transition matrix acts immediately before / after the permutation operator @xmath40 in the iteration process of eq .   where the particular transition matrix to be modified occurs explicitly .",
