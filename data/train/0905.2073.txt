    "[ intro ]    it has been argued since a long time @xcite that the dirac equation with an unbounded potential in vector coupling has no discrete but only completely continuous spectrum . it was shown in @xcite and subsequently confirmed in literature , that precise conditions have to be imposed to the potential for this to be true . in two later papers , @xcite",
    ", titchmarsh proved that the dirac equation with a linear vector potential satisfies the needed requirements and he studied the relativistic quantum mechanics of an electron in a constant ( or piecewise constant ) electric field .",
    "the first order of the asymptotic perturbation expansion was explicitly calculated due to the possibility of integrating the dirac equation in one space dimension by means of hypergeometric functions , but hard technical difficulties prevented further analytical developments , as well as the extension to a higher power law for the interaction or to more general inhomogeneous electric fields .",
    "the dirac equation with a vector potential that grows sufficiently fast at infinity is an incomplete dynamical problem . in classical terms",
    ", the particle can arrive at infinity in a finite time ; in the operator language , we have ( 2,2 ) deficiency indices and the appropriate asymptotic boundary conditions must be defined .",
    "there is an infinite number of such boundary conditions of the self - adjoint type not very meaningful from a physical point of view .",
    "the most physical condition is the absence of sources at infinity , corresponding to the gamow - siegert conditions , that assume outgoing wave functions only : in this case , however , the hamiltonian is not self - adjoint , the spectrum has complex eigenvalues , the dynamics is dissipative and the eigenfunctions have the meaning of metastable states of the dissipative dynamics itself : @xmath0 where @xmath1 , is the inverse of the mean lifetime of the metastable state @xmath2 .",
    "actually such states are stationary , if we neglect the decrease of the norm , so that they should be called metastationary ; we prefer not to call them resonances , since they are indeed different from the usual resonances and have a direct physical meaning .",
    "thinking of the transition from the non - relativistic to the relativistic system as a perturbation process in terms of the small parameter @xmath3 , the disappearance of the schrdinger bound states connected with the confining potential defines a singular perturbation problem . a numerical non - perturbative investigation of the one dimensional dirac equation with linear and quadratic potential has recently appeared @xcite : the purpose of that paper was to follow very closely the change of the spectrum when passing to the relativistic regime and to describe the spectral concentration @xcite at finite values of @xmath3 , or , in a more physical language , to determine the density of the states of the relativistic system .",
    "it was indeed produced a numerical evidence that the spectrum is completely continuous and that it is given by a sum of breit - wigner lines reducing to @xmath4-functions centered at the non - relativistic eigenvalues for smaller and smaller values of the ratio of the interaction to the rest energy , so that the spectral measure becomes atomic as it should . in @xcite the pair production rate",
    "was also calculated from the line width of the lowest state finding a perfect agreement , for the linear potential and in the range of validity of the first perturbation order , with the results obtained from the imaginary part of the schwinger effective action , @xcite .",
    "it should also be noticed that the qed results on the pair production for fermions in non constant electric fields are not yet so sound , although interesting proposals can be found in literature , ( see @xcite for an up to date review ) .",
    "we can finally remark that relativistic models with power - law potentials , in three space dimensions and in spherical geometry , have been used in the study of composite systems like quarkonium , in order to determine the mass spectrum of some meson families , @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we come back to the spectral properties of the dirac equation with a quadratic vector potential in a perturbation framework , completely different from that adopted in @xcite . indeed ,",
    "since the quantitative and numerical results on this subject are rather new , we find it interesting to make a comparison of independent computational approaches and eventually to have a confirmation of the results . in particular",
    ", we use here the method of the _ distributional borel sum _",
    "( hereafter dbs ) , that has proved a very useful tool for dealing with physical systems of singular nature . originating from a suggestion given by t hooft for double well problems , @xcite ,",
    "the dbs was studied in a series of papers @xcite-@xcite and it was successfully applied to @xmath5 lattice fields with large coupling in @xcite , to the non - relativistic stark resonances in @xcite and to the double well schrdinger operators in @xcite . to our knowledge however , despite the very deep mathematical development of the subject , no explicit numerical calculations with the dbs have been made up to date and no applications of it to the dirac equation have been considered . in this sense",
    "this paper represents a novelty and a test of the method for its possible practical uses .",
    "we will also show that the basic results of @xcite can be brought to bear to our present context , although some peculiarities due to the relativistic nature of the problem will emerge and must be taken into account .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in the next section , for the sake of completeness and because the knowledge of the dbs is not so widely diffused , we give a brief description of the method and we state more properly the spectral problem .",
    "in section [ dbs ] we study the general conditions for applying the dbs to the dirac equation and we discuss the possible strategies for the one - dimensional and the three - dimensional problems .",
    "finally , in section [ numeri ] , we present the numerical treatment for the one - dimensional case . using a perturbation parameter proportional to the ratio of the interaction to the rest mass energy , we calculate the perturbation series of the fundamental state energy up to a large order and we then construct its borel transform determining its asymptotic behavior .",
    "we then approximate the borel transform by pad approximants . although , in a strict mathematical sense , this is not a completely rigorous procedure since it is not proved that the borel transform is a stieltjes function , however an idea of the accuracy of the approximation can be obtained by comparing the position of the poles of the pad approximants with the location suggested by the asymptotic form of the perturbation series : indeed , as shown in section [ numeri ] , we find the pad poles exactly where the asymptotic behavior indicates they should be .",
    "we finally check the stability of the poles with the increasing orders of the pad approximants , implying the stability of the imaginary part of the perturbed energy .",
    "the latter is then calculated and it is found a perfect agreement with the results of @xcite , confirming them and proving the correctness and the effectiveness of both methods also in explicit numerical calculations : this is even more interesting in view of the fact that each of the two methods is more efficient in a different range of the values of the coupling constant , so to allow for the choice of the most appropriate one in a practical situation .",
    "[ spectralproblem ]    we consider the ( 3 + 1)-dim dirac equation interacting by means of a central vector potential @xmath6 .",
    "it is well known that the use of the spherical spinors , @xcite , easily leads to the diagonalization of the angular momentum and to the reduction of the dirac equation to the system of the two first order differential equations @xmath7 in ( [ diracequation_rad ] ) @xmath8 is the mass and @xmath9 the energy of the particle , while @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , @xmath13 are respectively the ` large ' and the ` small ' spherical component of the spinor .",
    "finally the parameter @xmath14 accounts for the angular momentum and the parity : @xmath15 for @xmath16 and @xmath17 for @xmath18 , @xcite , so that , in three space dimensions , @xmath14 can assume all integer values except zero . if , instead , we let @xmath19 in equation ( [ diracequation_rad ] ) and we change @xmath20 in @xmath21 , with @xmath22 , we obtain the one space - dimensional dirac equation that has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "we now assume a quadratic potential @xmath23 we rescale the system by introducing the dimensionless variables @xmath24 and we define the unknown functions @xmath25 the system ( [ diracequation_rad ] ) becomes then @xmath26 by eliminating @xmath27 we find the second order equation @xmath28    besides infinity , this equation , with @xmath29 , presents the obvious singularity at the origin , absent in the one - dimensional case with @xmath19 and @xmath30 .",
    "the non - relativistic limit for @xmath31 , @xmath32\\,{\\phi}_1(y)=0 \\label{secondorderequationomega_limit}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] reproduces the usual schrdinger equation , with orbital angular momentum @xmath33 , in a quadratic potential .",
    "the properties of the equation with @xmath34 , however , are very different from those of the non - relativistic counterpart , since ( [ secondorderequationomega ] ) , even neglecting the presence of an imaginary term , presents an asymptotic oscillatory behavior that prevents the existence of any normalizable solution .",
    "therefore , as we said , the perturbation expansion from the non - relativistic system turns out to be singular .",
    "we can transform the domain of definition of the differential equation ( [ secondorderequationomega ] ) with a map @xmath35 defined by @xmath36 the transformed differential equation becomes then @xmath37\\,{\\phi}(y)=0\\cr & { } & \\label{secondorderequationomega_senza}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    observing that @xmath38 , we find it useful to introduce the parameter @xmath39 according to whether @xmath40 or @xmath41 respectively .",
    "with such a choice of the signs , when @xmath42 no additional singularities besides the origin and the infinity appear at finite values of @xmath43 and the transformation @xmath35 is unitary .",
    "the equation to be studied can finally be written as @xmath44 whose ` potential ' is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 the double signs correspond again to @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively , while the dimensionless energy @xmath47 , entering @xmath48 in a polynomial expression , can be considered , for the moment , a parameter that will be determined during the calculation .",
    "it is common sense  and it can also be proved rigorously  that the equation ( [ secondorderequationomega_g ] ) with positive @xmath49 admits bound states : starting from these we can then try to make an analytic continuation in the complex plane of the coupling constant @xmath49 from the real positive to the positive or negative imaginary axis in order to recover the values of the parameters of the initial problem .",
    "the procedure , however , presents some delicate points .",
    "indeed the analytic continuation of the eigenvalue of the complete equation would be immediate if the eigenvalue itself was given as a convergent series expansion in the coupling constant @xmath49 .",
    "unfortunately this is not the case : the perturbation expansion in @xmath49 is asymptotic and has zero radius of convergence , @xcite . since finally our original problem has exactly @xmath50 , the system we are dealing with is therefore close to an unstable quartic oscillator , but for some non polynomial terms for which an additional discussion is in order : all the considerations we developed in the introduction about the incompleteness , self - adjoint extensions and boundary conditions at infinity thus apply .",
    "let us now recall that the study of the asymptotic expansions for treating perturbation problems in quantum mechanics was systematically undertaken since the beginning of the seventies and the main concept allowing to deal with divergent series was the borel summability @xcite .",
    "given a formal series @xmath51 we define its borel transform as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a fixed parameter independent of @xmath54 that is usually chosen in relation to the asymptotic behavior of the coefficients @xmath55 , but whose choice is otherwise irrelevant .",
    "if then @xmath56 has a nonvanishing radius of convergence , admits an analytic continuation to a neighborhood of the positive real axis and if the integral @xmath57 converges in a so called `` nevanlinna disk '' @xmath58 , we say that @xmath59 is the sum of @xmath60 in @xmath61 . in some favorable cases , where stronger properties hold ,",
    "more convenient summation methods have also been proposed as , for example , the stieltjes sum , @xcite : this can be defined when the classical stieltjes moment problem has a solution and the result can be conveniently expressed in terms of a convergent pad approximation .",
    "there are many cases , however , in which the borel summability and , _ a fortiori _ , the stieltjes summability can not be applied : notably , this occurs when the borel transform develops some singular point along the positive real axis , so that the integral ( [ borelint ] ) is not defined .",
    "the dbs originates from the need of finding a more flexible method of summation that could be able to avoid the difficulties connected with the emergence of the singularities .",
    "the idea is to follow closely the way used in the discussion of the riemann - hilbert boundary value problem with data assigned on the positive real axis .",
    "more precisely , we reduce the requirement of the analytic continuation of @xmath56 in a neighborhood of the positive real axis to the assumption of the existence of the analytic continuation of @xmath56 in the intersection of a neighborhood of the positive real axis with the upper complex half - plane , so that the boundary value @xmath62 is well defined for any @xmath63 . the integral yielding @xmath59 is then replaced by @xmath64 where the measure @xmath65 is finite and has positive moments @xmath66 .",
    "the function @xmath67 defined by the integral ( [ uppersum ] ) is analytic in the upper half - plane and it is called the _ upper sum_. in particular for @xmath68 we have @xmath69 and ( [ uppersum ] ) reproduces the relationship between boundary values of analytic functions and many distributions defined by the inverse laplace transform , @xcite .",
    "since then @xmath70 we also define the _ lower sum _ @xmath71 and we consider the real and the imaginary parts of @xmath67 : @xmath72 it is then natural to assume @xmath59 as the dbs of the series , while the discontinuity along the positive real axis , @xmath73 , is uniquely determined and it has a zero asymptotic power series expansion . in @xcite @xmath73 was related to the schwinger effective action .",
    "[ dbs ]    in this section we study the large order perturbation approach to the equation ( [ secondorderequationomega_g ] ) in one and in three space dimensions and we stress some physical relations between angular momentum and perturbation expansion . for the sake of completeness we will recall some useful facts related to general and well known properties of operators : greater details can be found in @xcite .",
    "these notions can be collected in two different main subjects .",
    "the first concerns the analytic properties of the operator family , related to the coupling constant of the perturbation part .",
    "this is essential if we want to explore the changes of the spectrum of the operators during the analytic continuation process .",
    "the second one deals with the estimates of the asymptotic growth of the perturbation series , that imply the existence of appropriate summation mechanisms .",
    "the differential equation defined in ( [ secondorderequationomega_g ] ) and dependent upon a parameter @xmath49 , has nice properties for @xmath74 , in the sense that we are able to determine exactly its discrete spectrum .",
    "the natural question to be posed is whether an eigenvalue @xmath75 of @xmath76 with a certain ( algebraic ) multiplicity @xmath77 gives rise to nearby eigenvalues @xmath78 with total multiplicity @xmath77 when the perturbation is switched on .",
    "if this is the case , the eigenvalue @xmath75 is said to be stable .",
    "we just recall that the discussion of this type of problems is simple enough when the perturbation potential @xmath79 is @xmath80-bounded , namely when the domain of definition @xmath81 contains @xmath82 , since this property yields @xmath83 , for constant @xmath84 and for any @xmath85 . from the previous inequality , as in the proof of the kato - rellich theorem",
    ", we can easily deduce that @xmath86 is independent of @xmath49 and that , for any @xmath87 , @xmath88 is an entire analytic function of @xmath49 . in this case",
    "the perturbation scheme is said to be regular .",
    "a slightly generalized strategy must be adopted when the perturbation is not @xmath80-bounded and specially when the behavior of the whole system depends dramatically upon the sign of the coupling constant or its square , as in our specific problem .",
    "the idea is to extract the fundamental properties of the relatively bounded case by means of the notion of analytic family of operators , introduced by kato @xcite : this term denotes a collection of operators @xmath89 dependent upon a coupling constant @xmath49 taking values in a region @xmath90 of the complex plane , where each @xmath91 has a non - empty resolvent and is defined on a domain @xmath92 independent of @xmath49 ; moreover , for each @xmath93 , @xmath88 is required to be strongly analytic in @xmath49 . although weaker than relative boundedness , this analyticity property is still sufficient to study the continuation of the eigenvalues in a region of the complex plane of @xmath49 and it can be proved that for @xmath94 in an appropriate open region of the resolvent set of @xmath95 the resolvent @xmath96 is analytic in @xmath49 when @xmath97 is sufficiently small .",
    "the stability of discrete and non - degenerate eigenvalues immediately follows . for isolated eigenvalues of multiplicity @xmath54 there",
    "exist @xmath33 families of eigenvalues @xmath98 admitting puiseux expansions in terms of @xmath99 , for integers @xmath100 , with total multiplicity @xmath54 .",
    "we are therefore left with the need to prove that a family of operators is analytic : the technique commonly used for this purpose is to establish appropriate quadratic estimates that allow us to deduce that each operator of the family is closed and that the perturbation term is small  in the sense of kato @xcite  with respect to any member of the family , so that the domains are indeed independent of the coupling constant .",
    "this argument can be formalized as follows @xcite : if @xmath101 and @xmath102 are closed operators with @xmath103 dense , then @xmath104 is closed if the inequality @xmath105 is satisfied for some constants @xmath84 .",
    "the one - dimensional quartic oscillator with a hamiltonian @xmath106 describes a situation very close to the dirac equation in one space dimension we want to discuss and its specific estimate , @xcite , can be formulated as follows : for @xmath107 and for all @xmath108 there exists @xmath109 such that @xmath110 .",
    "we finally observe that this estimate implies the herglotz property of @xmath111 , namely @xmath112 for @xmath113 , that gives precise informations about the analytic structure of @xmath111 and shows that @xmath74 can not be an isolated singular point , but it must be a limit point of singularities of the eigenvalues .    we will now discuss the application of these general facts to the dirac equation in a quadratic vector potential .",
    "@xmath114 _ the case in one space - dimension .",
    "_    let us consider first the one - dimensional problem .",
    "if we put @xmath19 in ( [ secondorderequationomega_g]@xmath115-[potential ] ) , we have the differential equation @xmath116{\\phi}(y)\\phantom{xxx}\\spazio{1.2}\\cr   & { } & \\phantom{xxxxxxxx}= { e}(1-g^2{e})\\,{\\phi}(y ) \\label{equa1dim_g}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] defined for @xmath117 , where @xmath118 .",

    "we consider the closed operators @xmath128 everything is known about @xmath101 since it is just the hamiltonian of a harmonic oscillator in the displaced variable @xmath129 .",
    "a direct calculation given in appendix a proves the quadratic estimate ( [ closure_cnd ] ) .",
    "it will be shown in section [ numeri ] that for parity reasons only even powers of the coupling constant @xmath130 contribute to the perturbation expansion of the eigenvalues .",
    "as a consequence of ( [ quadratic_estimate_1dim ] ) we can state that on the domain @xmath131 and with @xmath132 given in ( [ h0h1_1dim ] ) , the operators @xmath133 form a holomorphic family with compact resolvents for @xmath134 in the complex plane cut along the negative axis .",
    "we thus get a perturbations series for each eigenvalue @xmath135 with @xmath136 . for ( [ seriepertgenerale ] )",
    "there exists a borel transform ( [ boreltransform ] ) .",
    "the corresponding sum is given by @xmath137    @xmath138 _ the case in three space - dimensions .",
    "_    we next consider the three - dimensional problem assuming @xmath139 in order to simplify the notation : indeed the treatment is qualitatively the same for any other allowed value of @xmath14 .",
    "the equation ( [ secondorderequationomega_g ] , [ potential ] ) , then , specifies to @xmath140{\\phi}(y)={e}\\,{\\phi}(y ) \\label{equa3dim_g_k0 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and since @xmath49 is proportional to @xmath141 the limit @xmath142 correctly reproduces the schrdinger equation ( [ secondorderequationomega_limit ] ) with angular momentum @xmath143",
    ".    with respect to ( [ equa1dim_g ] ) , equation ( [ equa3dim_g_k0 ] ) contains non polynomial terms proportional to @xmath144 .",
    "the rational terms have vanishing denominators when both @xmath49 and @xmath43 tend to zero and the simultaneous limit is not well defined .",
    "the expansion in @xmath49 of the perturbation potential leads to terms with higher and higher divergences in the origin : @xmath145   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these terms make rather problematic the possibility of achieving a reasonable quadratic estimate . on the other hand the expansion in @xmath43 in the neighborhood of the origin gives ,",
    "up to to terms of @xmath146 , @xmath147 as the quadratic divergence at the origin is due to the angular momentum of the system , the term @xmath148 shows that , as a consequence of relativity , we are dealing with a spin @xmath149 fermion and that the spin is the only angular momentum left when @xmath139 . besides these physical observations ,",
    "however , the expansion can not be used perturbatively , not even for searching the local solutions at the origin .",
    "a different approach has therefore to be searched .",
    "we thus find it necessary to fix the final value of the parameter @xmath49 and to put this final value @xmath150 in the singular terms : we say that we _",
    "the parameter at its final value wherever it is needed .",

    "therefore the two terms of @xmath102 diverging like @xmath156 at the origin and presenting an at most constant behavior at infinity are small in the sense of kato with respect to @xmath157 in @xmath101 , so that they can be neglected in the estimate .",
    "since it is well known that @xmath158 is a closed operator on the maximal domain of the functions satisfying the condition @xmath159 at @xmath160 , that correspond to the regular solutions of the differential equation ( [ equa3dim_g_k0 ] )  and therefore @xmath101 is closed on the maximal domain with @xmath161 at the origin  , by means of a calculation analogous to ( [ quadratic_estimate_1dim ] ) we conclude that @xmath104 is closed and that the set @xmath162 , whose elements are specified in ( [ equa3dim_g_k0 ] ) , form an analytic family of operators with compact resolvent .",
    "we can thus conclude that for the three - dimensional case also we get a perturbation series like ( [ seriepertgenerale ] ) with @xmath136 for which the borel transform ( [ boreltransform ] ) and its inverse ( [ borelinversa ] ) are well defined .",

    "the coefficients of the asymptotic series in @xmath134 have alternate signs and , on the basis of the numbers we have calculated , we find the evidence for an asymptotic behavior @xmath208 to be more precise , we have defined the sequence @xmath209 where @xmath210 is given by the ratio of the coefficient @xmath211 of the initial divergent series divided by the right hand side of equation ( [ a_n_asymptotic ] )",
    ". we have then used the shanks transformation @xmath212 , @xcite , in order to improve the convergence of @xmath209 and we have found @xmath213 , where the rounding numerical error can be estimated of the order of @xmath214 .    some comments on the general features of the perturbation series and of its borel transform are in order . for positive values of @xmath134",
    "the series is borel summable . for negative @xmath134 ( namely for imaginary @xmath130 , which is the case we are interested in ) , all the terms of the series acquire equal signs and",
    "the series itself becomes borel summable only in the distributional sense .",
    "we will therefore assume the asymptotic series with all positive terms and thus consider @xmath215 in the borel anti - transformation integral ( [ borelinversa ] ) : the meaning of @xmath216 will be clarified below .",
    "dropping @xmath217 in the asymptotic behavior ( [ a_n_asymptotic ] ) it is clear that the borel transform develops singularities on the positive real axis , the first of which has to be expected in the neighborhood of 8/3 . the shift in the energy of the state , given by @xmath59 in ( [ fz_dz ] ) , can be plainly calculated by taking the principal part of ( [ borelinversa ] ) with respect to the poles on the real axis .",
    "the imaginary part of the perturbed energy , given by @xmath73 in ( [ fz_dz ] ) , has a much more interesting physical meaning : indeed @xmath218 gives the decay constant @xmath219 of the state itself as in ( [ normdecay ] ) and , in an interpretation connected with a second quantization framework , to the particle - antiparticle production rate @xmath220 , where @xmath221 is the effective lagrangian of the system , @xcite .",
    "the imaginary part will be computed by summing the contributions of the positive real poles to the integral ( [ borelinversa ] ) , calculated along the integration path encircling those poles in the upper complex half plane . an efficient way to make",
    "the calculation is to use a pad approximation for the borel transform @xmath56 of the perturbation series .",
    "since @xmath56 is expressed by a series expansion up to order 125 , we can take pad approximants of rather high order and to look at the stabilization of the values of the poles .",
    "the results for the seven lowest poles are summarized here below .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tavola3 ]        we will conclude the section by comparing the results here obtained with those presented in @xcite .",
    "the methods used to get them , as we said , are completely different . on the one hand",
    ", we have a perturbation approach that becomes more and more precise when the perturbation parameter decreases and needs many further terms for intermediate values of that parameter : the imaginary part of the energy is directly calculated by using the pad approximants to invert the borel transform in the distributional sense and integrating along the appropriate path in the complex plane . on the other ,",
    "the determination of the spectral concentration is obtained by a numerical integration of a differential equation that presents some accuracy problem for very low values of the coupling constant and works better at higher values : the imaginary part is now deduced from the half - width of the breit - wigner lines that fit the continuous spectrum .",
    "this makes the two methods complementary and puts rather narrow bounds to the range of the @xmath222 values in which the comparison makes sense : a reasonable interval for the present data could be assumed to be @xmath223 . within these bounds",
    "fig.1 shows that the agreement is complete , proving the effectiveness of both the dbs and the method of @xcite for solving numerical problems .",
    "in this appendix we give the proof of the quadratic inequality ( [ closure_cnd ] ) with @xmath101 and @xmath102 given in ( [ h0h1_1dim ] ) .",
