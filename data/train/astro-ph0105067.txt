    "definitions and current fitted values of orbital parameters are listed in table [ fit ] , as kindly supplied by g. marcy and d. fischer ( 2001 ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath0 in equation ( @xmath24 ) and table [ fit ] is a given planet s argument of pericenter referenced to the plane of the sky :    @xmath25 \\arccos ( \\mathbf{\\hat{n } } \\cdot \\mathbf{\\hat{e } } ) \\in ( -\\pi,\\pi ] \\label{omegasky}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath26    let the origin be positioned at the barycenter of @xmath14 and and take the sky plane to contain this origin . then @xmath27 is the unit vector pointing from the origin to the observer ; @xmath28 is the unit vector parallel to the planet s orbital angular momentum ; @xmath29 is the unit vector directed from the origin to the node of the orbit on the sky plane at which the planet is approaching the observer ; and @xmath30 is the unit vector pointing from the origin to the pericenter of the planet s orbit .",
    "figure [ defgeo ] illustrates the geometry .",
    "a single value of @xmath0 corresponds to a volume of allowed parameter space swept out by vectors @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath30 .",
    "curiously , the @xmath0 s of the outer two planets c and d are presently nearly identical : @xmath31 .",
    "let us define @xmath32 to be the mutual inclination between the two orbit planes of planets c and d. if we assume for the moment that @xmath33 , so that the orbits are co - planar and `` co - rotating , '' then the observation that @xmath34 implies the near perfect alignment of orbital pericenters .",
    "we may ask whether the alignment is merely coincidental , or whether a dynamical mechanism exists to lock the apsidal lines together .",
    "precedents for apsidal locking exist in the solar system .",
    "eccentric planetary rings precess rigidly about uranus and saturn ; the inner and outer elliptical edges of a given ring maintain the same line of apsides by a balance of forces due to the quadrupole field of the central planet , ring self - gravity , and interparticle collisions ( chiang & goldreich 2000 ) .",
    "of greater relevance to the case of @xmath14 and is the observation that the periapsides of some asteroids librate ( undergo small oscillations ) about the apsidal line of jupiter ( milani & nobili 1984 ) .",
    "such asteroids inhabit a secular apsidal resonance in which their time - averaged apsidal precession rates match that of jupiter .",
    "planets c and d of @xmath14 and might occupy a similar apsidal resonance .",
    "how might we use this possibility to constrain the origin of these planets ?",
    "suppose that such a resonance operates if @xmath33 , and suppose that it does not operate otherwise .",
    "in the latter case , suppose that @xmath6 circulates ( cyclically runs the gamut between @xmath7 and @xmath35 ) , so that the probability of finding @xmath36 at any given time is small . given these assumptions , the observation today that @xmath36 might lead us to suspect that @xmath33 .",
    "co - planarity would argue , in turn , that planets c and d formed from a flattened , circumstellar disk .",
    "even if the resonant dynamics are fully understood , this line of reasoning is suggestive at best . a quantitative , bayesian assessment of the _ a posteriori _ probability distribution for @xmath4 given the observation that @xmath36 requires knowledge of the _ a priori _ probability distribution for @xmath4 .",
    "the latter distribution depends upon the unknown conditions of the formation of these two planets  the very object of our inferences .",
    "this paper examines the long - term evolution of the orbits of planets d , c , and to a limited extent b , within the multi - dimensional parameter space of present - day viewing and orbital geometries that are permitted by the doppler observations .",
    "we seek to identify regions in this parameter space  in particular , all ranges of the mutual inclination @xmath4that correspond to orbital evolutions for which @xmath36 for all time ; we suggest that the planets of @xmath14 and reside in regions that are characterized by such apsidal resonances .",
    "the volume of parameter space to be surveyed is substantial ; for instance , if @xmath37 , then @xmath38 does not even necessarily imply that @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 lie in the same plane .",
    "equality of @xmath0 s merely reflects the equality of angles which may well be referenced to different nodes and which may therefore have no direct physical relation .",
    "previous explorations of this parameter space by rivera & lissauer ( 2000ab ) and stepinski , malhotra , & black ( 2000 ) have indeed uncovered the existence of a secular apsidal resonance between planets c and d in the @xmath33 case .",
    "furthermore , considerations of dynamical stability presented by these authors limit values of @xmath43 in the @xmath33 case to be greater than @xmath80.3 .",
    "stability considerations also argue against @xmath44 ( stepinski et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "our analysis extends and improves upon these previous results in a number of respects .",
    "first , we take explicit account of the dependence of @xmath0 on viewing geometry . to our knowledge , the only study to mention this dependence is that of rivera & lissauer ( 2000a ) , who incorporate it in their calculations of co - planar , counter - rotating orbits ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "second , we systematically explore all of the parameter space spanned by possible orbital configurations of planets c and d and by possible lines - of - sight ; previous studies explore only a fraction of this space .",
    "third , we focus on the evolution of @xmath6 as a means of distinguishing between likely and unlikely orbital configurations .",
    "as we shall see , the existence of a secular apsidal resonance characterized by small libration amplitude in select regions of parameter space suggests tighter constraints on @xmath4 than considerations of stability alone .",
    "finally , the doppler - fitted values of orbital parameters that we employ are improved over those used in previous studies due to the increased number of data points ( @xmath46 radial velocity measurements as of january 2001 ; marcy & fischer 2001 ) .    in ",
    "[ cop ] , we take @xmath4 to be zero and study the secular evolution of the orbits of planets c and d while neglecting the presence of the innermost planet b. we recover analytically the secular resonance found numerically by rivera & lissauer ( 2000ab ) and stepinski et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and describe its physical character . in  [ mut ] , we allow @xmath37 while continuing to ignore planet b. all viewing / orbital configurations for which @xmath47 potentially librates about @xmath7 are identified . in  [ planb ] , we ask which of the resonant configurations found in  [ mut ] are likely to remain resonant with the inclusion of planet b. section [ conc ] marshals our results to argue that the planets of @xmath14 and most likely originated in a circumstellar disk .",
    "in the co - planar , co - rotating case , the individual @xmath0 s represent longitudes of pericenters referenced to a common nodal vector @xmath29 and a common orbital plane .",
    "we ask in this case whether @xmath6 circulates or librates , and investigate how the answer depends on uncertainties in the orbital parameters , including @xmath43 .",
    "long - term variations in the eccentricities and apsidal longitudes of the outer two planets are qualitatively well described by the classical secular solution of laplace - lagrange ( l - l ; see , e.g. , murray & dermott 1999 ) .",
    "let @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and let @xmath50 be the ratio of laplace coefficients ( brouwer & clemence 1961 ) .",
    "these quantities are evaluated using the orbital parameters of marcy & fischer ( 2001 ) . then    @xmath51    where the frequencies @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and ratios @xmath54 and @xmath55 , are constants specified by the masses and secularly invariant semi - major axes of the two planets :    @xmath56    here @xmath57 is the orbital period of planet c. these equations neglect terms of order @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the laplace - lagrange description is valid for small values of the mutual inclination @xmath4 provided @xmath0 is replaced by @xmath60 , the longitude of pericenter referenced to the invariable plane ( the usual `` dog - leg '' angle defined in , e.g. , murray & dermott 1999 ) .    in writing equations ( [ ll])([rat ] ) ,",
    "we have omitted terms due to the third , innermost planet b. provided planet b remains on an orbit that is more than a factor of 10 smaller than the orbits of the outer two bodies , its time - averaged potential acts mainly as a static quadrupole moment .",
    "this quadrupole could add corrections up to order @xmath61 @xmath8 a few percent to our expressions for the eigenfrequencies ( [ freq ] ) and eigenvector amplitude ratios ( [ rat ] ) . in this section and  [ mut ] ,",
    "we neglect the effects of planet b for clarity of presentation and computational ease .",
    "we incorporate quantitatively the effects of planet b in  [ planb ] .",
    "the remaining four constants @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 require specification of the initial eccentricities and apsidal longitudes .",
    "if initial conditions are such that @xmath65 and @xmath66 , then equations ( [ ll])([ll4 ] ) imply that the two planets precess in lockstep at frequency @xmath53 with fixed eccentricities and aligned pericenters .",
    "the present - day orbital parameters of @xmath14 and are such that most , but not all , of the power is in the `` @xmath67 '' eigenmode . setting @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 at @xmath72 , we obtain with a numerical root - finder :    @xmath73    the evolution described by equations ( [ ll])([finalanswer ] ) is plotted in figures [ ew]abc . on average , both @xmath74 and @xmath75 advance at the same rate @xmath53 . in addition , however , the admixture of power from the `` @xmath76 '' mode ( @xmath63 is not substantially smaller than unity ) implies that @xmath75 librates about @xmath74 at a faster frequency @xmath8@xmath52 .",
    "the argument of pericenter of planet d librates less since that planet carries the bulk ( @xmath875% ) of the angular momentum in the system .",
    "the apsidal libration amplitude in l - l theory is a function of the initial individual eccentricities ( @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) , the initial difference in apsidal longitudes ( @xmath79 ) , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 . for planets",
    "c and d , most of the uncertainty in the l - l libration amplitude arises from uncertainties in the fitted eccentricities .",
    "figure [ contour]a exhibits the variation of l - l libration amplitude with @xmath77 and @xmath78 , for fixed @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 .",
    "allowance is made for the fact that for fixed @xmath80 and @xmath85 , the observed @xmath86 according to equation ( [ doppk ] ) .",
    "we take @xmath79 to be @xmath7 because this approximation permits the immediate solution of equations ( [ ll])([rat ] ) .",
    "variations in libration amplitude with @xmath87\\,(2\\sigma { \\rm\\,confidence\\,interval})$ ] are typically less than 10% ( other parameters being held fixed ) ; these variations are small compared to the @xmath850% variation in libration amplitude associated with the @xmath88 confidence region in fitted eccentricities .",
    "variations in libration amplitude associated with uncertainties in @xmath80 and @xmath89 are negligibly small , at the level of @xmath80.3% and @xmath83% , respectively .",
    "since the l - l libration amplitude is sensitive to the mass ratio but not to the individual masses , it is independent of @xmath43 in the co - planar case .",
    "the l - l amplitude associated with the best - fit eccentricities is 25@xmath90 .",
    "the corresponding fraction of time that the system spends with @xmath91 equals @xmath92 . within the @xmath88 error ellipse of fitted eccentricities ,",
    "the amplitude ranges from @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) to @xmath95 ( @xmath96    we conclude from this analytic study that if planets c and d occupy co - planar , co - rotating orbits , then they inhabit a secular resonance for which @xmath6 librates about @xmath7 with an amplitude of @xmath97 .",
    "in other words , if @xmath33 , the observation today that @xmath98 should not be regarded as surprising , since the best - fit system spends about one - quarter of its time in this state .",
    "these libration parameters change slightly as we incorporate more realistic effects in subsequent sections ( e.g. , the presence of planet b is included in  [ planb ] ) .",
    "we verify the analytical considerations above by numerically integrating the orbits of planets c and d using the swift software package developed by levison & duncan ( 1994 ) .",
    "we employ their mixed variable symplectic integrator , which is derived from the algorithm invented by wisdom & holman ( 1991 ) .",
    "as before , the effects of planet b are neglected .",
    "the timestep is sufficiently small ( @xmath99 days ) that the total energy in the system is conserved to within 1 part in @xmath100 after @xmath101 .",
    "initial conditions are taken from the best - fit parameter values in table [ fit ] .",
    "the starting epoch of our integrations was chosen arbitrarily to be jd 2450160.1 days .",
    "since the effects in which we are primarily interested are secular ( orbit - averaged ) , our results should be qualitatively insensitive to choice of starting epoch .",
    "we have verified that none of our conclusions changes by choosing an alternative starting epoch of jd 2451160.1 days . moreover , since substantial changes in the osculating orbital elements of planets c and d occur only over secular timescales that are long compared to the duration of the radial velocity observations , the errors in the fitted orbital parameters in table [ fit ] introduced by the assumption of fixed keplerian ellipses are no more than several percent ( laughlin 2001 ; see also laughlin & chambers 2001 ) .",
    "as seen in figures [ ew]def , the behavior of @xmath6 with time for @xmath102 computed using swift is similar to that predicted by l - l . for smaller values of",
    "@xmath103 $ ] and correspondingly greater planetary masses , the system remains in the secular apsidal resonance , but short period terms in the disturbing potentials effectively increase the amplitude of libration .",
    "thus , the fraction of time for which @xmath98 decreases from @xmath104 to 0.20 as @xmath43 decreases from 1 to 0.3 . for @xmath105 , we find , as do rivera & lissauer ( 2000b ) and stepinski et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , that the system is unstable .",
    "figure 3b plots the maximum value of @xmath6 over @xmath106 as a function of the initial eccentricities for @xmath102 .",
    "the contours are similar to those predicted by l - l , with deviations introduced by short period terms and higher order secular terms .",

    "how does the secular evolution of @xmath6 change with mutual orbital inclination , @xmath4 ?",
    "in particular , for what ranges of @xmath4 can planets c and d occupy an apsidal resonance ?",
    "we answer these questions using monte - carlo sampling techniques and numerical orbit integrations . as in  2",
    ", we neglect the effects of planet b. we begin by delineating the parameter space spanned by viewing geometries and orbital configurations of planets c and d that are allowed by the doppler observations .",

    "each member of the set of allowed initial conditions may be used as initial conditions for the swift orbit integrator .",

    ", we find empirically that the fraction of initial orientations that are allowed does not vary with @xmath120 . at every @xmath120 , the first @xmath134 , randomly generated , allowed initial conditions are employed as input conditions for the swift orbit integrator .",
    "we believe that our choice for @xmath135 adequately samples parameter space since we have taken @xmath136 at several values of @xmath120 and find none of our conclusions below to be changed . as discussed in  [ ns ] , the starting epoch of all integrations was jd 2450160.1 days .",

    "a system is considered to be unstable if either planet collides with the central star or if either planet is ejected from the system . in practice , we take the latter criterion to be satisfied if the semi - major axis of the orbit exceeds 20 au ; we have checked _ a posteriori _ that stable scenarios preserve semi - major axes to within @xmath810% . integrating @xmath139 scenarios , each for @xmath140 with a timestep of @xmath99  days , requires 6 cpu days on a dec alpha workstation .    secular libration of @xmath6 about @xmath7 is a typical outcome for @xmath141 .",

    "in the previous section we found those allowed initial conditions involving only planets c and d that result in libration of @xmath6 . here",
    "we add the effects of the third , innermost planet b to these resonant configurations , in the expectation that some of the resultant 3-planet systems will not be stable .",
    "the inclusion of planet b introduces a number of complications .",

    "computational needs are further exacerbated by the fact that the orbital period of planet b is 4.6 days ; this necessitates a commensurately short computational timestep .",
    "finally , planet b is sufficiently close to its parent star that contributions to the planet s apsidal and nodal precession rates due to stellar oblateness and general relativistic effects are not negligible compared to contributions from the outer two planets .",

    "the effects of stellar oblateness and general relativity are ignored .",
    "while the above procedure does not permit accurate determination of the long - term orbital evolution of planet b , we believe it does capture qualitatively the effect of planet b on the possibility of resonant apsidal lock between planets c and d. we expect the innermost planet to represent primarily a potential means of destroying the apsidal resonance , as the secular growth of @xmath149 takes planet c disruptively close to planet b.    scenarios for which all three planets survive the entire duration of the integration are shown in figure [ bcd ] . only scenarios for which @xmath183 qualify . for @xmath184 ,",

    "thus , the `` anomalous '' resonant configurations at @xmath186@xmath169 found in  [ dyn ] do not survive the inclusion of planet b. a similar fate probably befalls the scenario for which @xmath187 ; an orbit integration of duration @xmath188 is required to confirm this suspicion .    for @xmath156 , planets c and d can remain in stable resonant lock despite the presence of planet b. values of @xmath189 in 3-planet scenarios are somewhat reduced from their respective values in 2-planet scenarios .",
    "values of @xmath190@xmath191 obtain for @xmath192 ; at @xmath193 , @xmath107 drops to 0.13 .",
    "our results suggest that the outer two planets of upsilon andromedae occupy nearly co - planar , co - rotating orbits .",
    "the lines of evidence are as follows :    1 .   finding the doppler measured @xmath0 s of planets c and d to be nearly equal today is least surprising if the mutual orbit inclination @xmath161 ( figures [ prodist ] and [ bcd ] ) . if @xmath161 , planets c and d can be locked in a secular apsidal resonance for which @xmath194 librates about @xmath7 with an amplitude of approximately  @xmath9 .",
    "the corresponding fraction of time that @xmath98 is @xmath195 .",
    "these libration parameters are subject to change with future refinements in the values of the present - day fitted eccentricities ( figure [ contour ] ) .",
    "by contrast , if @xmath164 , typically @xmath6 circulates and @xmath196 for the relatively few allowed initial conditions that give rise to stable systems .",
    "the secular apsidal resonance at @xmath161 limits variations in eccentricities and thereby affords the system stability ( figure [ ew ] ) .",
    "by contrast , if @xmath146 , secular driving of the eccentricity of planet c to values approaching unity via the kozai resonance fosters close approaches and concomitant instability .",
    "if @xmath154 , the destabilizing effects of coupled @xmath149 and @xmath4 are abetted by synchronized driving of the eccentricities .",
    "we note that co - planar , counter - rotating configurations ( @xmath197 ) are allowed by argument 2 but disfavored by argument 1 .",
    "furthermore , values of @xmath2 , @xmath3 are favored , not only for reasons of stability , but also because such values are typical of scenarios for which the fraction of time spent with small @xmath198 is maximized .",
    "the preference for small mutual inclination , based on combining considerations of stability with the likelihood of finding @xmath36 , is consistent with the origin of these planets in a flattened , circumstellar disk .",
    "how does our expectation that @xmath161 compare with orbital inclinations in related contexts ?",
    "the opening angle of hydrostatically flared protoplanetary disks at stellocentric distances of @xmath81 au is @xmath86@xmath90 ( see , e.g. , chiang & goldreich 1997 ) .",
    "the planets in the solar system , with the understandable exception of pluto ( malhotra 1998 ) , occupy orbits whose mutual inclinations do not exceed about 7 degrees ; mercury aside , mutual inclinations do not exceed about 3 degrees .",
    "by contrast , scenarios for the formation of extrasolar planets that do not involve a primordial disk may predict a substantial population of systems for which @xmath199 .",
    "for example , papaloizou & terquem ( 2000 ) have proposed that extrasolar planets might gravitationally fragment from , and scatter out of , a circumstellar spherical cloud of gas .",
    "planetary systems having a wide distribution of initial mutual inclinations from @xmath200 to @xmath121 might be expected to form . from the stability considerations elucidated above",
    ", we might expect a bimodal population of systems to survive  those for which @xmath201 and those for which @xmath202intermediate inclinations having been eliminated via the destructive kozai effect .",
    "the final word on the actual values of orbital inclinations in extrasolar planetary systems will likely come from combining the doppler radial velocity data with astrometric measurements , or , in rare cases , from transit observations ( mazeh et al .",
    "2000 ; queloz et al",
    ".  2000 ) .",
    "the amplitudes of stellar wobbles induced by planets c and d are ( @xmath203 ) mas and ( @xmath204 ) mas , respectively ( pourbaix 2001 ) .",
    "the star @xmath14 and is sufficiently bright ( @xmath205 ) that the upcoming astrometric satellite fame ( full - sky astrometric mapping explorer ) should yield at least a @xmath88 detection of the astrometric signature of planet c.    we thank geoff marcy and debra fischer for generously providing updated values of the fitted orbital parameters of @xmath14 and , fathi namouni for useful conversations , and greg laughlin for a prompt and thoughtful referee s report .",
