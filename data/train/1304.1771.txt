    ", the angle @xmath3 above appears in the projections of coincident tetrahedral faces .",
    "noteworthy about these transformations is that they have a tendency to bring previously separated faces of `` adjacent '' tetrahedra into contact and to impart a periodic nature to previously aperiodic structures .",

    "in this section we describe the construction of several interesting aggregates of regular tetrahedra .",
    "the aggregates of sections  [ s : comedge ] and [ s : comvertex ] initially contain gaps of various sizes . by performing special rotations of these tetrahedra",
    "these gaps are `` closed '' ( in the sense that faces of adjacent tetrahedra are made to touch ) , and , in each case , the resulting angular displacement between coincident faces is either identically equal to @xmath3 or is closely related . in section  [ s : helix ] , a rotation by @xmath3 is imparted to tetrahedra arranged in a helical fashion in order to introduce a periodic structure and previously unpossessed symmetries .      0.3   is produced in the projection of a `` face junction.'',title=\"fig : \" ]    0.3   is produced in the projection of a `` face junction.'',title=\"fig : \" ]    0.3   is produced in the projection of a `` face junction.'',title=\"fig : \" ]    consider aggregates of _ n _ regular tetrahedra , @xmath4 , arranged about a common edge ( so that an angle of @xmath5 is subtended between adjacent tetrahedral centers , see figure  [ f : fga ] for an example with five tetrahedra ) . in each of these structures , gaps exist between tetrahedra that may be `` closed '' ( i.e. , faces are made to touch ) by performing a rotation of each tetrahedron about an axis passing between the midpoints of its central and peripheral edges through an angle given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the tetrahedral dihedral angle and @xmath8 .",

    "when this is done , an angle of @xmath3 is produced in the projection of faces in a `` face junction.'',title=\"fig : \" ]    the present document is focused on the angle @xmath12 , which is , in fact , the angle obtained in the `` face junction '' produced by executing the above procedure for @xmath13 tetrahedra ( see figure  [ f : fivegroup ] ) .",
    "it is interesting , however , that a simple relationship may be established between this angle and @xmath14 . by evenly arranging three tetrahedra about an edge and rotating each through the axis extending between the central and peripheral edge midpoints , the face junction depicted in figure  [ f : tgc ]",
    "is obtained .",
    "the angle between faces in this junction , @xmath14 , may be related to @xmath3 in the following way : @xmath15 to see this , note that @xmath16 gives the solution @xmath17 , which reduces the right hand side of to @xmath14 .    in this section , we have produced two aggregates of tetrahedra whose face junctions bear a relationship to the angle @xmath18 . in the section that follows",
    ", we will locate this angle in the face junctions produced through rotations of tetrahedra about a common vertex .",
    "0.3     0.3     0.3       consider the icosahedral aggregation of 20 tetrahedra depicted in figure  [ f : twga ] .",
    "the face junction of figure  [ f : twgc ] is obtained when each tetrahedron is rotated by an angle of @xmath19 about an axis extending between the center of its exterior face and the arrangement s central vertex .",
    "as above , this operation `` closes '' gaps between tetrahedra by bringing adjacent faces into contact .",
    "interestingly , the face junction obtained here consists of tetrahedra with a rotational displacement equal to the one obtained in the case of five tetrahedra arranged about a common edge above , i.e. , @xmath20 .",
    "( it should be noted , however , that @xmath21 and @xmath22 are not produced by equations   and , respectively , as those formul  are only valid for @xmath4 . )    in all of the cases described above , gaps are `` closed '' and `` junctions '' are produced between adjacent tetrahedra in such a way that the angle @xmath12 appears in some fashion in the angular displacement between coincident faces . for the case of 5 tetrahedra about a central edge and 20 tetrahedra about a common vertex , this angle is observed directly . for the case of 3 tetrahedra about a central edge , the angular displacement between faces is closely related : @xmath11 .",
    "we now turn to an arrangement obtained by directly imparting an angular displacement of @xmath3 between adjacent pairs of tetrahedra in a linear , helical fashion known as the boerdijk - coxeter helix",
    ". an interesting result of performing this action is that a previously aperiodic structure is transformed into one with translational and rotational symmetries .",
    "0.3     0.3     0.3       in sections  [ s : comedge ] and [ s : comvertex ] we described a procedure by which initial arrangements of tetrahedra were transformed so that adjacent pairs of tetrahedra were brought together to touch . in each of these structures ,",
    "coincident faces are displaced by an angle equal or closely related to @xmath3 . here",
    ", will will construct two periodic , helical chains of tetrahedra by directly inserting an angular offset by @xmath3 between each successive member of the chain . for their close relationship with the boerdijk - coxeter helix",
    ", we refer to these structures by the term _ modified bc helices_.    the construction of a modified bc helix is depicted in figure  [ f : philix ] . starting from a tetrahedron @xmath23 , a face @xmath24 is selected onto which an interim tetrahedron , @xmath25 , is appended .",
    "the @xmath26 tetrahedron is obtained by rotating @xmath25 through an angle @xmath3 about an axis @xmath27 normal to @xmath24 , passing through the centroid of @xmath25 .",
    "( note that this automatically produces an angular displacement of @xmath3 between two faces in a `` junction , '' see figure  [ f : bcjunction ] . )",
    "the structure that results from this process depends on the sequence of faces @xmath28 selected in order to construct the helical chain .",
    "this sequence determines an _ underlying chirality _ of the helix  i.e . , the chirality of the helix formed by the tetrahedral centroids  and plays a pivotal role in the determination of the structure s eventual symmetry .",
    "( however , it should be noted , of course , that some sequences of faces do not result in helical structures .",
    "faces can not be chosen arbitrarily or randomly ; they must be selected so as to build a helix . )    0.3     0.3     0.3     by performing the procedure depicted in figure  [ f : philix ] , using an angular displacement of @xmath3 between successive tetrahedra , periodic structures are obtained with 3 or 5fold symmetry ( upon their projections , see figures  [ f:5bchelix ] and [ f:3bchelix ] ) , depending on the relative chiralities between the rotational displacement and the underlying helix : when * like * chiralities are used one obtains 5fold symmetry ; when * unlike * chiralities are used one obtains 3fold symmetry .",
    "in addition to rotational symmetry , these structures are given a linear period , which we quantify here as the number of appended tetrahedra necessary to return to an initial angular position on the helix .",
    "for a modified bc helix with a period of _ m _ tetrahedra , we use the term _",
    "m_-bc helix .",
    "accordingly , the procedure described above produces 3 and 5bc helices , which are shown in figure  [ f : mbchelices ] .",
    "( see @xcite for a proof of these structures symmetries and periodicities . )",
    ".plane class numbers for aggregates described in section  [ s : aggregates ] . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have seen the construction of several aggregates of tetrahedra .",
    "each of these structures contains tetrahedra with coincident faces , offset angularly by @xmath3 or a closely related angle ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "we will now explore some of the interesting features of these structures . as already noted , it is interesting that @xmath3 appears in the face junctions of structures generated by `` closing '' gaps between tetrahedral aggregates .",
    "it is additionally interesting that when this angle is employed in the construction of a helical chain of tetrahedra , a periodic structure emerges ( whereas the canonical bc helix has no non - trivial translational or rotational symmetries ) .    the features we will highlight in this section involve the reduction in the overall number of `` plane classes '' and the linear displacements between facial centers in a face function . here",
    ", we say that two planes belong to the same _ plane class _ if and only if their normal vectors are parallel .",
    "the _ number of plane classes _ for a collection of tetrahedra , then , is defined as the number of distinct plane classes comprising the collection s two - dimensional faces . by rotating tetrahedra so as to bring faces into contact ( as in sections  [ s : comedge ] and [ s : comvertex ] ) , or rotating tetrahedra to obtain periodicity ( as in section  [ s : helix ] ) the overall number of plane classes for an aggregate",
    "is reduced .",
    "clearly , as the values of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath21 are such that they bring faces of adjacent tetrahedra into contact , we would expect to see a reduction in the number of plane classes in the corresponding aggregations of tetrahedra featured in sections  [ s : comedge ] and [ s : comvertex ] .",
    "it is interesting , however , that rotation of the tetrahedra in a bc helix by @xmath3 ( observed in the face junctions of figures  [ f : fgc ] , [ f : tgc ] , and [ f : twgc ] ) obtains a reduction from an arbitrarily large number of plane classes ( @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the number of tetrahedra in the helix ) to relatively small numbers : 9 plane classes in the case of the 3-bc helix , 10 plane classes in the case of the 5-bc helix .",
    "table  [ t : planeclasses ] provides the numbers of plane classes for the tetrahedral aggregates described in section  [ s : aggregates ] before and after their transformations .    , where @xmath34 is the tetrahedron edge length , the displacement between tetrahedra of a face junction for 5 tetrahedra about a common edge ( pictured center right ) .",
    "from left to right the displacements between the tetrahedra are @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 . ]    finally , an appealing feature is observed in the face junction projections of the tetrahedral aggregates discussed in this paper .",
    "figure  [ f : facejunctions ] provides a side - by - side comparison of these face junctions .",
    "as the angular displacement between tetrahedra in all face junctions is related to @xmath3 , we can see that translation of a tetrahedron in one junction can produce any of the other junctions .",
    "let the displacement between tetrahedra in the face junction of 5 tetrahedra about a common edge be denoted by @xmath39 , where @xmath34 is the tetrahedron edge length .",
    "starting from the face junction of a 3 or 5-bc helix , the remaining face junctions corresponding to 20 tetrahedra about a vertex , 5 tetrahedra about an edge , and 3 tetrahedra about an edge may be obtained by translating a tetrahedron of the junction by @xmath35 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "in this paper we have presented the construction of several aggregates of tetrahedra . in each case , the construction process involved rotations of tetrahedra by a value related to @xmath40 .",
    "the structures produced here have several notable features : faces of tetrahedra are made to touch ( `` closing '' previously existing gaps between tetrahedra ) , aperiodic structures are imparted with periodicity , and the total number of plane classes is reduced .",
    "the purpose of the present document , however , is not merely descriptive ; it is hoped that these notable features have generated interest in the reader of rotational transformations of tetrahedra involving the angle @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , it is desired that further observations may be found which transform aggregates of tetrahedra such that faces are brought into contact and the number of plane classes is reduced ."
