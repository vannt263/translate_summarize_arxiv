    "it is impossible to overestimate the role , which entangled photon pairs have played and continue to play in the field of quantum communication and quantum information @xcite .",
    "polarization entangled photon pairs are routinely produced by nonlinear optical effects , predominantly by parametric down - conversion process @xcite , of which entanglement dynamics has been investigated , and many extraordinary results have been obtained , such as entanglement sudden death ( esd ) @xcite , and sudden birth @xcite , etc .",
    "the proposal that the biexciton - radiative cascade process in a single quantum dot ( qd ) provides a source of polarization entangled photon pairs was first made by benson _",
    "@xcite , and has been realized by stevenson _",
    "et al . _ and akopian _",
    "several tests have also been performed on the state of the photon pair to study the entanglement behavior @xcite .",
    "however , recent works show that , even without entanglement , there are quantum tasks @xcite superior to their classical counterparts .",
    "this is due to their nonzero quantum correlations , introduced by henderson and vedral @xcite , which describes all the non - classical correlations in a state , while entanglement is only a special part of the correlations .",
    "recently , some special results have been obtained for quantum correlation , such as sudden change @xcite in the evolution , that is the derivation of quantum correlation is not continuous at some points as it evolves with time .    in this work , we use the model that we presented in ref.@xcite to investigate quantum correlation dynamics of the photon pairs generated from a qd .",
    "when we consider the influence of the temperature of the qd system , a special temperature has been found , at which the behavior of quantum correlation suddenly changes .",
    "our study also indicates that this temperature is independent of the background noise and lower than entanglement sudden - death temperature .",
    "therefore , the sudden - change behavior of correlation may be easier to be observed in experiments .",
    "the paper is organized as following . in sec.[model and",
    "method ] , we briefly introduce the model of qd and the method that we used to calculate the quantum correlation of the photon pair .",
    "the result is described in sec.[result ] .",
    "we present our conclusion in sec.[conclusion ] .",
    "the model of the biexciton cascade process in a qd is presented in figure[fourlevel ] .",
    "a single qd is initially excited to the biexciton state , involving two electrons and two holes by a short - pulsed laser , and subsequently evolves freely .",
    "a biexcton photon @xmath0 or @xmath1 is emitted as the dot decays to an exciton ( @xmath2 ) state by recombining one electron and one hole .",
    "the polarization of the biexciton photon is either horizontal ( @xmath3 ) or vertical ( @xmath4 ) , in accord with the decay into the exciton state @xmath5 or @xmath6 , respectively . after some time delay @xmath7 ,",
    "the other electron and hole recombine to emit an exciton photon @xmath8 or @xmath9 with the same polarization as that of the earlier biexciton photon .",
    "therefore , this process generates entangled two - photon state @xcite @xmath10 with @xmath11 the energy splitting between the exciton states , as shown in fig.[fourlevel ] , which has conventionally been called the  fine structure splitting \" ( fss ) , and can be tuned by a lot of methods in experiment @xcite .    due to",
    "this fss being about tens of @xmath12ev , it is necessary to consider the phonon assisted transition between the two exciton states ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) in the process . in this system ,",
    "the phonon absorption rate is @xmath13 and the emission rate is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the phonon - qd interaction rate , which is approximately proportional to the cube of the energy splitting @xmath11 @xcite , and @xmath16 is the bose distribution function of a phonon with energy @xmath11 , @xmath17^{-1}$ ] . in experiment , in order to overcome the influence of fss , a time gate can be used to select the exciton photon with only a short emission delay @xmath18 relative to the biexciton photon , which has been carried out by stevenson _",
    "_ @xcite .    in our calculation",
    ", we assume the total polarization density matrix @xmath19 of the cascaded emission photon includes three parts : the one with non - classical correlations @xmath20 whose portion @xmath21 is determined by the spectrum overlap of exciton and biexciton photons , the distinguished part @xmath22 and the background noise @xmath23 , @xmath24.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the elements of @xmath20 can be derived by master equation method and quantum regression theorem which is presented in ref.@xcite . the second term @xmath22 has the same diagonal elements with @xmath20 , but its nondiagonal elements are all zero .",
    "the noise term @xmath23 is set as an identity matrix .    to obtain quantum correlation , classical correlation must be acquired first , which is defined as @xcite @xmath25,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the maximum is taken over the set of projective measurements @xmath26 on the subsystem of exciton photon , @xmath27 is the conditional entropy of the subsystem of biexciton photon , given the knowledge ( measure ) of the state of the exciton photon , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the reduced density matrix of the biexciton ( exciton ) photon , and @xmath31 is the von neumann entropy of @xmath32 .",
    "then quantum correlation is obtained by subtracting @xmath33 from the quantum mutual information which denotes the total correlation , that is @xmath34 where @xmath35 .    in all the calculations ,",
    "the temporal window width @xmath36 is fixed at @xmath37ns , short enough to select entangled photon pairs .",
    "because this short temporal window is equivalent to about @xmath38@xmath12ev in the energy domain according to fourier transform , which is far larger than the fss that we set , thus it can not resolve the which - path information within the cascade emission process .",
    "the correlations dynamic with respect to the temperature is shown in fig.[ct ] .",
    "we set fss as @xmath39@xmath12ev and fix the emission delay @xmath40 at @xmath41ns , which is shorter than the exciton lifetime ( @xmath42 0.8ns ) and can be recognized as the evolution time of the system .",
    "we compare two conditions : ( a ) without background noise @xmath43 and ( b ) with a large background noise @xmath44 .",
    "the factor @xmath45 discussed in ref.@xcite represents the portion of the noise . in both of the conditions ,",
    "the correlations of the photon pair reduce monotonically with temperature , due to the faster phonon assisted transition rate @xmath46 and @xmath47 at raised temperature resulting in the larger decoherence .",
    "an interesting phenomenon is that the quantum correlation decreases slowly at low temperature , but the decreasing rate changes to be fast suddenly when the system reaches to a critical temperature , @xmath48 , indicated by the arrow in the figures , which we call the sudden - change temperature . at @xmath48 ,",
    "the first order derivative of the function of the quantum correlation behavior is not continuous .",
    "moreover , @xmath48 is almost the same for both of the two conditions , indicating that the evolution behavior of quantum correlation is independent of the background noise .",
    "this can be understood from the definition of quantum correlation in eqs.([classical ] ) , and ( [ quantum ] ) .",
    "the noise part of the matrix is an identity matrix , which only reduces the correlation , but does not influence its derivation . here",
    "we also notice that the quantum correlation may be greater than the classical one at some temperatures , for example , at the critical temperature .    in fig.[ctao ]",
    ", the behavior of correlations with increased emission delay @xmath49 is similar to that in fig.[ct ] .",
    "no matter whether there is background noise , the phenomenon of quantum correlation sudden - change still takes place at the same point of emission delay .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this peculiar sudden - change behavior is different from esd .",
    "indeed , we have shown this system also undergoes esd @xcite , but at a different temperature @xmath50 .    to see more about the correlation sudden - change temperature @xmath48 and esd temperature @xmath50 ,",
    "we plot them as a function of the emission delay @xmath40 , as shown in fig.[tt ] , where @xmath50 is found much higher . for @xmath40 near to zero , both of the critical temperatures are higher than @xmath51k , and they decrease rapidly . at the beginning , @xmath48 decreases faster , but when the emission delay is longer than @xmath41ns , the decreasing rate apparently becomes slow .",
    "moreover , as we have mentioned above , @xmath48 is independent of the background noise , but @xmath50 is lower for larger noise .    in fig.[ts ] , we show the critical temperatures depending on fss .",
    "obviously , the entanglement sudden - death temperature decreases fast from a large value , however , the correlation sudden - change temperature is always around @xmath52k , and decreases slightly .",
    "all the phenomenon indicate that quantum correlation sudden - change temperature can be hardly influenced by the non - quantum factors , but is determined by the phonon assisted process .    comparing the phenomenon of correlation sudden change and esd in this system",
    ", we find the former may be easier to be observed in experiment , because it is weakly dependent on the noise and fss , and the critical temperature is much lower resulting in better signal to noise ratio to reconstruct the polarization matrix of the photon pair by means of quantum state tomography @xcite .",
    "however , to observe esd , a large fss is needed , which makes the degree of entanglement extremely low and request much higher accuracy in experiment .",
    "in conclusion , we have calculated the quantum correlation of the photon pair emitted from quantum dots , and considered how the temperature , evolution time and fss affect the quantum correlation of the photon pair .",
    "we found the phenomenon that quantum correlation behavior suddenly changed at a critical temperature .",
    "this critical temperature is independent of the background noise in the system and is weakly dependent on the fss of a qd . moreover , the temperature is low enough for qd to emit cascaded photon pair with more correlation and entanglement , which makes sudden - change of correlation easier to be observed in experiments ."
