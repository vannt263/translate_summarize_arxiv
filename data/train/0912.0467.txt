    "for the last decade , metamaterials @xcite are in the focus of research attention in theoretical and applied electrodynamics .",
    "even though no commonly accepted definition is available @xcite , this research direction experiences a boom encompassing a wide span of areas ranging from microwave engineering to nonlinear optics .",
    "one of the well - known suggestions for applications was formulated as a `` perfect lens '' @xcite , making use of negative effective material parameters and providing imaging with subwavelength resolution .",
    "the idea of super - resolution was subsequently analysed and developed in a number of ways @xcite , and even realized in practice ( speaking about three - dimensional systems ) using split - ring resonators ( srrs ) @xcite , or transmission - line networks @xcite .",
    "arguably the closest approach to practice offered by metamaterials , is related to magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) .",
    "for example , rotational resonance of magnetoinductive waves @xcite was suggested for parametric amplification of mri signals @xcite or enhanced detection with flexible ring resonators @xcite .",
    "alternatively , applications based on ` swiss - rolls ' @xcite or wire media @xcite channelling were put forward @xcite .",
    "naturally , superlens concept is also promising in this area : specifically for mri , an isotropic lens based on capacitively loaded single ring resonators was designed and experimentally tested @xcite .",
    "such a metamaterial lens is intended to operate at the value of effective permeability @xmath0 . in theory , for modelling such metamaterials ( based on srrs ) , one can exploit an effective medium approach , taking care of numerous limitations related to general restrictions of homogenization @xcite as well as to specific peculiarities caused by resonant nature of the structural elements @xcite . universally , all the structure details ( size of the elements and lattice constants ) must be much smaller than the wavelength ; while the total number of elements in metamaterial should be sufficiently large to make homogenization meaningful .",
    "in addition , spatial dispersion effects can be rather remarkable in metamaterials , and impose further restrictions on effective medium treatment , prohibiting that in certain frequency bands @xcite .    unless one opts for a completely numerical homogenization method @xcite , generally applicable to almost arbitrary structures , a model have to be developed to describe adequately the effective medium properties .",
    "quite general approach @xcite for homogenization of resonant metamaterials can be applied to a variety of metamaterials including those which combine different element types . however , this relies on the dipole approximation for the interaction of elements in the lattice , which may not be always valid .",
    "for example , mutual interaction of the circular currents close to each other significantly differs from dipole interaction , which becomes relevant for dense metamaterials .",
    "the first rigorous analysis of such metamaterials was given early in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the effective permeability has been derived given the properties of individual elements and lattice parameters , through the classical procedure of averaging the microscopic fields . in that approach ,",
    "mutual inductances between a large number of neighbours are taken into account , revealing the importance of lattice effects .",
    "this approach , however , is limited to quasi - static conditions , and requires wavelength to be much larger than any structural details . later on , a rigorous method was elaborated for isotropic lattices of resonant rings @xcite , which accounts for spatial dispersion . on the other hand ,",
    "the latter approach employs a nearest neighbour approximation as otherwise full analytical treatment becomes impractical .",
    "the above theoretical methods provide the effective parameters for `` infinite '' structures ( which in practice implies the structures sufficiently large in all three dimensions ) .",
    "the lens of ref .",
    "@xcite , however , contains just a few elements across the slab . specifically for this case",
    ", a method was developed to calculate the transmission properties for a thin infinite slab @xcite ; furthermore , it was shown that similar results can be obtain by considering an equivalent slab with the effective medium parameters as obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that a number of peculiar effects caused by the discrete structure of the lens as well as its finite size , can not be reliably assessed with the above models , as the lens is too small for an effective medium treatment . on the other hand ,",
    "it is large enough to make an analysis with full - wave commercial software practically impossible .",
    "for this reason , here we develop a finite model to calculate lens properties , which explicitly takes all the structural details into account .",
    "the goal of this paper is to describe this modelling approach in detail , and to illustrate that indeed it does reveal some features which are missed by the continuous modelling .",
    "we should note , though , that while the model is described in connection to one particular structure , the approach applied here is generally applicable to any realistic srr - based metamaterial , and therefore is useful for a wide range of applications .    photograph of the quasi - magnetostatic metamaterial lens analysed in this paper . ]",
    "the metamaterial lens described in ref .",
    "@xcite is composed of capacitively loaded rings ( clrs ) periodically arranged in an isotropic three - dimensional lattice with the lattice constant @xmath1 cm .",
    "the lens features three planes of 18 by 18 clrs interlayered with orthogonal segments providing two mutually orthogonal sets of two layers 17 by 18 clrs each ( see fig .",
    "[ lensfoto ] for clarity ) , which makes it up to roughly 2200 clrs .",
    "this lens can be optionally extended by an extra 3d - layer , resulting in having four @xmath2 layers interlaced with the two orthogonal subsystems of 3 by 17 by 18 clrs , amounting to about 3130 elements .",
    "overall dimensions of the ( non - extended ) lens are thus @xmath3  cm .",
    "the clrs themselves ( fig .",
    "[ lensgeom]a ) are made of copper through etching metallic strips on a dielectric board .",
    "the mean radius @xmath4 of the clrs is 0.49 cm ( @xmath5 ) and the strip width @xmath6 is 0.22 cm ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the clrs are loaded with lumped non - magnetic 470pf capacitors .",
    "the self - inductance of the clrs , @xmath8nh , has been obtained from the measured value of the frequency of resonance in free space , equal to 63.28mhz ( @xmath9 ) . by measurement of the quality factor of the resonator",
    "the resistance has been estimated as @xmath10ohm , which includes the effects of both the ring and the capacitor .",
    "( a ) sketch of the clr resonator ; ( b ) scheme of the lens with the corresponding coordinate system . ]",
    "we reserve the standard coordinate system ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) for discussions on the level of geometry of one ring and their mutual interactions , as relevant for the next section .",
    "when referring the overall lens geometry , we define supplementary coordinate system ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) so that the lens geometrical centre is placed at the coordinate origin , and the @xmath15 axis is perpendicular to the lens as slab ( `` lens axis '' ) , while the long edges of the lens are parallel to @xmath14 and @xmath16 axes ( fig .  [",
    "lensgeom]b ) .",
    "note that the coordinate origin is between the rings , and thus the lens is completely symmetric with respect to the coordinate origin , all the axes and all the coordinate planes ( in the analysis , we neglect minor asymmetry occurring in the real lens caused by specific assembly details , e.g. resulting from substrate thickness , as these deviations are of the same order as unavoidable production inaccuracy ) .",
    "for the three mutually orthogonal sets of clrs , we will refer to as x - rings , y - rings or z - rings , depending on whether the rings normals are along @xmath14 , @xmath15 or @xmath16 axes .",
    "the lens , therefore , contains 612 of either x - rings and z - rings , and 972 y - rings .",
    "we will also introduce a consecutive numbering of all the clrs with a single index .",
    "the so called input and output surfaces of the lens correspond to @xmath17 cm , while the theoretical source and image planes are at @xmath18 cm .",
    "for the analysis of the lens response to the external field , we consider an ideal cubic lattice of l  c circuits supporting current . with the time convention as @xmath19 ,",
    "each of the currents is governed by equation @xmath20 where the self - impedance @xmath21 is determined by the resistance @xmath22 , self - inductance @xmath23 and self - capacitance @xmath24 of the single clr , while @xmath25 represents the total magnetic flux through the considered ring which can be written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the magnetic flux from external sources and @xmath28 are the mutual inductances between the rings @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "combining eq .   and",
    "eq .   we obtain @xmath31 with @xmath32 , @xmath33 , which is a system of linear equations for unknown currents , provided that the external sources are known .",
    "mutual inductance between the flat rings ( which is the case under consideration ) carrying the currents @xmath34 and @xmath35 uniform along the ring contour is , most generally @xcite , @xmath36 where @xmath37 represent surface current densities ; we assume that these follow maxwellian distribution across the strip , @xmath38 clearly , such integration is not ideally suited for numerical calculation . in the first approximation , mutual inductance between clrs can be estimated with the one between linear currents ( double linear integration along the equivalent ring contour ) , but for close clrs this does not give a good precision .",
    "however , a trick is that the result of surface integration according to eq .",
    "can be approximated with a good precision through an average mutual inductance between two pairs of circular currents @xcite . this way , each flat ring can be represented by a pair of coaxial circular currents of radii @xmath39 , and the sought mutual inductance is calculated as an average between the four corresponding linear ones : @xmath40 which essentially decreases calculation time .",
    "the value of particular parameter @xmath41 depends on the ring geometry , but does not depend remarkably on the relative orientation and distance between the clrs ( within the limits of lens structure ) . for the particular parameters considered here ,",
    "@xmath42 was numerically found to give a good match to the precise integration ( while @xmath43 would correspond to the edges of the strip ) .",
    "geometry of the linear currents for parallel or orthogonal ring orientations , as relevant for mutual inductance calculations . ]    to achieve a faster calculation for the `` linear '' mutual inductance itself , we further note that it can be easily evaluated @xcite by integrating the vector potential @xmath44 along the current contour @xmath45 : @xmath46 with vector potential itself having only @xmath47 component ( assuming that the source ring is placed at the coordinate origin with the normal along @xmath13 axis , see fig .",
    "[ mutuals ] ) , which can be obtained with the help of elliptic integrals as @xcite @xmath48 with @xmath49 being the argument of complete elliptic integrals @xmath50 given the fact that the fast pre - defined routines for elliptic integrals are available in a number of computational platforms ( e.g.  matlab@xmath51 ) , this effectively reduces double integration to a single one .",
    "thus , finally , only four linear integrals like are required to approximate the exact value of a double integration like .",
    "to analyse the response of the lens to an external field source , the key step lies in solving system . to do so , we need to know the matrix of mutual inductances @xmath52 .",
    "this matrix is only determined by the geometry of the rings arrangement inside the lens and can be calculated once for a given lens geometry , while the impedance matrix @xmath53 can be then obtained for all frequencies as shown after .",
    "for such a lens as described above , having 2196 rings , the matrix contains almost 5 million values , and filling those with a direct calculation would be rather time - consuming even with a simplified integration described in the previous section .",
    "however , obvious reciprocity ( @xmath54 ) and symmetry properties of the lens allow for a great simplification of matrix filling .",
    "indeed , the lens is symmetric with respect to @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 axes as well as to @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 planes .",
    "this implies , in particular , that the mutual inductances between x - rings and y - rings are all the same as between z - rings and y - rings .",
    "furthermore , as all the rings are identical , inductance between them is only determined by their mutual orientation and spatial offsets @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 ( see fig .  [ mutuals ] ) , and for parallel rings even @xmath58 is equivalent to @xmath59 . explicitly ,",
    "integration for the mutual inductances between the parallel rings is performed according to @xmath61 where @xmath62 ; and for the rings with orthogonal mutual orientation @xmath63 in the above equations , we imply a general case that the radii of the two rings ( @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) can be different .",
    "thus , a number of ring pairs within the lens share the same value of mutual inductance , so it is only necessary to calculate a full set of non - equivalent mutuals and then assign those values depending on the mutual offsets . with the particular lens considered here ,",
    "there are only 1924 independent inductances for the parallel ring orientation , and 1668 for the orthogonal one , so the total number of calculations is 3592  orders of magnitude smaller than the number of matrix elements .",
    "this way , the entire matrix can be filled in a matter of seconds on an ordinary pc .",
    "another preliminary step is to determine the external flux @xmath66 imposed to each ring by a given source . for a homogeneous field or a plane wave excitation , calculation is straightforward with the known coordinates of each ring : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a ring normal while magnetic field @xmath69 can be evaluated at the ring centre as the field variation across the ring is negligible .",
    "frequency dependence of the real ( a ) and imaginary ( b ) parts of the impedance measured by a 3-inch coil placed at the image plane ( @xmath70 cm ) . ]    in practice , the lens is typically used along with excitation / measuring coils employed in mri practice . in that case , instead of calculating the field produced by a coil over each ring ( which is further complicated as this field is not uniform across the ring ) , it is much easier to obtain the flux directly @xmath71 in terms of mutual inductance @xmath72 between the coil and each ring , which can be calculated with the same method as the one between the rings . above",
    ", @xmath73 is the total current induced in the coil by the external voltage source as well as by the lens . imposing a given voltage @xmath74 to the coil with the self - impedance @xmath75",
    ", we can include the coil mutual impedances into system , modified as @xmath76 with @xmath77 and @xmath78 being the total number of rings in the lens . clearly",
    ", additional coils , if necessary , can be included by extending the matrix system in an analogous way .",
    "after the above procedures , it is finally possible to solve the systems or obtaining currents @xmath34 in each ring for any given excitation . with these known , it is further possible to calculate any desired response of the lens , such as magnetic field produced by the lens ( using standard biot - savart expressions ) or impedance as measured by the mri coil , @xmath79",
    "armed with the above precise method , we can have a detailed look into lens features and response to various external field sources . in previous work",
    "@xcite it was concluded that the accurate model , developed for an 2d - infinite slab with the same structure and thickness as the real lens , is capable of predicting the observations made in connection to lens use in mri practice . in a typical setup ,",
    "a coil of 3 inch in diameter is placed parallel to the lens interface at the source plane , @xmath80 cm ( that is , at a distance 1.5 cm , equal to one half of the lens thickness from the lens surface ) .",
    "the super - lens behaviour implies that the magnetic field produced by the coil , is then reproduced in the space behind the image plane ( @xmath81 cm ) , as if the coil itself were present in place of the image .",
    "axial component @xmath82 of the total magnetic field observed behind the lens surface along the lens axis ( 1 ) or along the parallel line ( 2 ) slightly displaced in @xmath14 and @xmath16 direction so that it passes through the centre of one ring ( see the inset for the labels of the axes ) .",
    "comparison between the two models when the lens is excited by 3-inch coil , centred with respect to the lens axis and placed at @xmath83 cm . ]",
    "a straightforward example to test the developed model and to compare it with practice as well as with earlier models , is to evaluate the impedance as measured by a coil in front of the lens , depending on frequency . in the discrete model ,",
    "it is given by eq .",
    ", while with the continuous model ( for an infinite homogeneous slab with an appropriate effective permeability @xcite ) it can be numerically calculated as @xmath84 where @xmath85 is electric field reflected by the lens .",
    "the two modelling results are compared in fig .",
    "[ imput ] along with the experimental data .",
    "although there is no exact quantitative matching to the measured data , it is clear that the frequency dependence provided by the discrete model is closer to experiment than that of the continuous calculation . on the other hand",
    ", we can conclude that the latter already provides qualitatively suitable picture , predicting an overall pattern of the impedance frequency dependence .    with both the continuous model @xcite and the model developed above , it is easy to obtain the axial magnetic field @xmath82 behind the lens for a given excitation .",
    "comparison between the predictions of the two models is shown in fig .",
    "[ hfcomp ] .",
    "one can see that at distances smaller than about one lattice constant ( @xmath86 cm ) , @xmath82 is essentially inhomogeneous as the near - field of the individual rings dominates , so that the total field is quite different whether traced along the lens axis ( which passes between the rings ) or along a line that passes through a ring centre , while both are remarkably different from the continuous model .",
    "this is an obvious consequence of the discrete lens structure , which can not be revealed by a homogenized model but is apparent in practice . at distances larger than approximately one lattice constant ( @xmath87 cm ) ,",
    "the field observed along the two axes converge , and are qualitatively similar to the continuous model with a fair numerical agreement ( see fig .",
    "[ hfcomp ] ) .",
    "axial component @xmath82 of the magnetic field observed behind the lens surface .",
    "horizontal axis corresponds to the lens surface ( parallel to @xmath14@xmath16 plane ) , while the vertical one is normal to the lens ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "only one half of the symmetrical field spatial distribution is presented ; normalized magnitudes are shown in logarithmic scale between 10 ( white ) and 0.1 ( black ) a / m .",
    "excitation with coils of different radii ( 0.5 cm , 1.5 cm , 3 cm and 4.5 cm ) , centred with respect to the lens axis and positioned at @xmath83 cm . ]",
    "another peculiarity arising from the discrete structure is related to the spatial resolution of the lens in the @xmath14@xmath16 plane .",
    "evidently , a lens can not resolve any details which are separated by distances of the order of lattice constant . to identify the actual limitation , we test the magnetic field distributions originating from using the coils of various small radii ( fig .  [ varcoil ] ) . for excitations with a coil of the ring size",
    ", the entire lens is dominated by standing magnetoinductive waves @xcite , and the field pattern does not suggest any hints for resolving the source ( fig .",
    "[ varcoil]a ) .",
    "indeed , practically the same field pattern is observed with a three times larger coil , two lattice constants in diameter ( fig .  [ varcoil]b ) . with a still larger coil , encompassing four lattice constants",
    ", one may argue that the pattern starts to clarify ( fig .",
    "[ varcoil]c ) , though still it can not be reliably used to assess the source location and size .",
    "a reasonable picture is obtained for a 4.5 cm coil radius , where the field farther than the image plane looks as expected with super - lens performance ( fig .",
    "[ varcoil]d ) .",
    "we can therefore conclude that spatial resolution of the discrete lens can be assumed to be of the order of 5 lattice constants .",
    "this observation is in good agreement with the general concerns regarding the lattice effects in metamaterials @xcite .    with the above examples , we clearly demonstrate that the exact model described in this paper , is suitable for a reliable description of the metamaterial lens , and makes it possible to predict specific observations which might be missed by a continuous model .",
    "certainly , the above methodology is not restricted to the particular lens geometry and can be perfectly used for any metamaterials designed with clrs or srrs , whether isotropic or anisotropic , and also arbitrarily small in size .",
    "the only limitation is that for very large number of elements , numerical evaluation on conventional computers may fail , specifically as far as allocating space for huge impedance matrices , and inverting these , is concerned .",
    "however , in metamaterial research it rarely comes to samples that large , and , on the other hand , when it comes , then there are good reasons to expect that continuous models will work sufficiently fine .",
