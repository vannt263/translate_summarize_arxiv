    "radon - type transforms that integrate functions over various sets of ellipses / ellipsoids have been arising in the recent decade , due to studies in synthetic aperture radar ( sar ) @xcite , ultrasound reflection tomography @xcite , and radio tomography @xcite . in particular ,",
    "radio tomography is a new imaging method , which uses a wireless network of radio transmitters and receivers to image the distribution of attenuation within the network .",
    "the usage of radio frequencies brings in significant non - line - of - sight propagation , since waves propagate along many paths from a transmitter to a receiver .",
    "given a transmitter and a receiver , wave paths observed for a given duration are all contained in an ellipsoid with foci at these two devices .",
    "it was thus suggested in  @xcite to approximate the obtained signal by the volume integral of the attenuation over this ellipsoid , which is the model we study in this article .    due to these applications",
    ", there have been several papers devoted to such `` elliptical radon transform . '' the family of ellipses with one focus fixed at the origin and the other one moving along a given line was considered in  @xcite . in the same paper ,",
    "the family of ellipses with a fixed focal distance was also studied .",
    "the authors of  @xcite dealt with the case of circular acquisition , when the two foci of ellipses with a given focal distance are located on a given circle .",
    "a family of ellipses with two moving foci was also handled in  @xcite .    in all these works , however , the ellipses have varying eccentricity .",
    "also , their data were the line integrals of the function over ellipses rather than area integrals .",
    "the radio tomography application makes it interesting to consider integrals over solid ellipsoids . in this article",
    ", we consider the volume integrals of an unknown attenuation function over the family of ellipsoids of rotation in @xmath0 with a fixed eccentricity and two foci located in a given hyperplane .",
    "we thus reserve the name * elliptical radon transform * @xmath1 for the volume integral of a function @xmath2 over this family of ellipsoids .",
    "the volume integral of a function @xmath3 over an ellipsoid of the described type is equal to zero if the function is odd with respect to the chosen hyperplane .",
    "if the hyperplane is given by @xmath4 , we thus assume the function @xmath5 to be even with respect to @xmath6 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 .    given a radon type transform ,",
    "one is usually interested , among others , in the following questions : uniqueness of reconstruction , inversion formulas and algorithms , range conditions , and a stability estimate  @xcite .",
    "these are the issues we address below .",
    "the problem is stated precisely in section  [ formulation ] .",
    "two inversion formulas are presented in sections  [ natinversion ] and  [ reddinginversion ] .",
    "analogue of the fourier slice theorem is obtained in section  [ natinversion ] by taking the fourier transform with respect to the center and a radial fourier transform with respect to the half distance between two foci .",
    "this theorem plays a critical role in getting a stability estimate and necessary range conditions .",
    "the formula discussed in section  [ reddinginversion ] is obtained by taking a fourier type transform and needs less integration than the previous one in section  [ natinversion ] .",
    "a stability estimate is handled in sections  [ estimate ] .",
    "section  [ unique ] is devoted to uniqueness for a local data problem .",
    "we consider all solid ellipsoids of rotation in @xmath0 with a fixed eccentricity @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and foci located in the hyperplane @xmath4 .",
    "we will identify this hyperplane with @xmath11 .",
    "the set of such ellipsoids depends upon @xmath12 parameters , which is @xmath13 too many . to reduce the overdeterminacy , we require that the focal axis is parallel to a given line ,",
    "for instance , the @xmath14 coordinate axis .",
    "let @xmath15 be the center of such an ellipsoid and let @xmath16 be the half of the focal distance .",
    "we denote this ellipsoid by @xmath17 .",
    "then , the foci are @xmath18 and the points @xmath19 are described as follows:@xmath20 to shorten the formulas , we are going to use the following notation : @xmath21 the elliptical radon transform @xmath22 maps a locally integrable function @xmath3 into its integrals over the solid ellipsoids @xmath17 for all @xmath23 and @xmath16 : @xmath24 our goals are to reconstruct @xmath2 from @xmath1 and to study properties of this transform .",
    "in this section , we assume @xmath25 . here",
    "is our strategy .",
    "first of all , we change the ellipsoid volume integral to the ellipsoid surface integral , differentiating with respect to @xmath26 .",
    "second , we take the fourier transform of this derivative of @xmath1 with respect to @xmath27 . next , taking a radial fourier transform with respect to @xmath26 , we obtain an analogue of the fourier slice theorem .    we introduce a back projection operator @xmath28 for @xmath29 as @xmath30 in fact , @xmath31 is the dual transform not to @xmath32 , but rather to @xmath33 , i.e. , @xmath34    let @xmath35 denote the characteristic function of a set @xmath36 : @xmath37 then the elliptical radon transform can be written as @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the jacobian factor , and @xmath42 is the surface measure on @xmath43 .",
    "formula   can be simplified by differentiation with respect to @xmath26 and division by @xmath44 , which yield @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath47 is invariant under the shift with respect to the first @xmath48 variables .",
    "that is , if @xmath49 for @xmath50 and @xmath51 , we have @xmath52 thus , application of the @xmath53-dimensional fourier transform with respect to the center @xmath27 seems reasonable . doing this and changing the variable @xmath54 to",
    "the polar coordinates @xmath55 , we get @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the fourier transforms of @xmath1 and @xmath2 with respect to the first @xmath48 coordinates @xmath59 of @xmath60 and @xmath27 of @xmath61 , respectively , and @xmath62 .    to compute the inner integral , we use the known identity @xcite @xmath63 we thus get @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
    "this enables us to get an analogue of the fourier slice theorem .",
    "[ inversionfourier ] for a function @xmath25 that is even with respect to @xmath6 , the following formula holds : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the @xmath68-dimensional fourier transform of @xmath2 .",
    "let us denote the radial fourier transform by @xmath69 , i.e. , @xmath70 we recall that if @xmath2 is a radial function on @xmath0 , then the fourier transform @xmath58 of @xmath2 is also radial and @xmath71 where @xmath72(cf .",

    "we get equation  .",
    "theorem  [ inversionfourier ] leads naturally to a fourier type inversion formula for even functions , if one supplements equation   with the inverse fourier transform .",
    "one can also obtain a useful relation with convolution .",
    "[ lem : unique ] let @xmath92 and @xmath93 be even in @xmath6 . if @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "then we have @xmath96 where @xmath97    note that since @xmath98 for a radial function @xmath2 on @xmath0 and @xmath72 , we get @xmath99 .",

    "in this section , we provide a different inversion formula for the elliptical radon transform . to obtain this formula ,",
    "we start to take a transform , which is like the fourier transform , but with kernel @xmath104 instead of @xmath105 , of the derivative of @xmath1 in @xmath26 . to get the fourier transform of @xmath2 from this transform , we change variables .",
    "we start from formula  .",
