    "pulsar winds are relativistic outflows , consisting mainly of electrons and positrons .",
    "they are thought to be poynting - flux dominated at launch , as quantified by the magnetization parameter @xmath0 which is the ratio of poynting to kinetic energy flux , with @xmath1 . far away from the light cylinder , which is at radius @xmath2 with @xmath3 the pulsar s rotational frequency ,",
    "the magnetic field is predominantly toroidal with an amplitude falling as @xmath4 and reverses sign across a corrugated current sheet that separates the two magnetic hemispheres .",
    "the wind propagates radially as a transverse subluminal wave with speed equal to the bulk speed of the outflow , or equivalently lorentz factor @xmath5 .",
    "the opening angle around the equator of the region of alternating magnetic field depends on the misalignment of the magnetic and rotational axes of the pulsar , denoted by @xmath6 .    in the absence of dissipation , the wave propagates outwards from the light cylinder while remaining poynting - dominated@xcite . however , after crossing the termination shock , the outflow s magnetization is low@xcite . where and when conversion of poynting flux to particle energy happens is still not clear .",
    "magnetic reconnection in the current sheets separating regions of opposite magnetic field polarity in the wind is a possible dissipation mechanism , however this process is much too slow to account for the conversion in isolated pulsars like the crab , unless the pair injection by the pulsar is much larger than generally assumed@xcite@xcite .",
    "another possibility is driven reconnection at the termination shock , which has been demonstrated to dissipate the striped wind s alternating field efficiently in some cases .",
    "this , however , requires even higher particle injection rates than reconnection in the current sheets@xcite@xcite .",
    "a solution can be provided in the form of non - linear superluminal waves , i.e. electromagnetic waves of large amplitude with phase speed @xmath7 .",
    "these can propagate outside of a critical radius @xmath8 , at regions of lower particle density@xcite ( as a contrast to the magnetohydrodynamic wind which needs a minimum particle density ) .",
    "the conversion of the striped wind to a superluminal mode is possible if @xmath8 is smaller than the shock radius .    in the following",
    "we will investigate non - linear superluminal waves of linear polarization , which are relevant in a region of opening angle @xmath6 around the equator of a pulsar wind .",
    "we identify the superluminal modes into which a striped wind can convert by imposing `` jump conditions '' across the ( thin ) region where conversion happens .",
    "we will assume throughout that the waves can be considered as locally plane and purely transverse .",
    "these are excellent approximations far away from the light cylinder ( at @xmath9 ) .",
    "the radial direction , which is the direction of propagation of the wave , can be identified with the @xmath10direction in a cartesian system of coordinates .",
    "the surviving field components are then @xmath11 and @xmath12 , corresponding to the azimuthal magnetic field and the polar electric field .",
    "the equations governing the evolution of a cold , two - component plasma are the continuity equation and the equations of motion for each species , along with maxwell s equations .",
    "we are looking for periodic solutions in a special frame of reference that propagates with velocity @xmath13 with respect to the laboratory frame ( in the laboratory frame , which coincides with the pulsar frame , the wave phase speed is @xmath14 ) .",
    "we will call this special frame homogeneous or h - frame .",
    "the advantage of this formulation is that in the h - frame all space dependence vanishes and only time dependence remains , and the phase is just @xmath15 with @xmath16 the wave frequency@xcite . from now on quantities in the h - frame will be unprimed , while quantities in the laboratory frame will be primed .    in the h - frame ,",
    "the conservation of magnetic flux ( @xmath17 ) is automatic , and it can be seen immediately from faraday s law that the magnetic field is constant . from coulomb s law and the continuity equation",
    "we get @xmath18 , where a plus(minus ) subscript denotes positrons(electrons ) .",
    "furthermore , the lorentz factors are equal @xmath19 and the other components of the dimensionless four - velocity of the two species are related by : @xmath20because of these equations we can drop the subscripts and solve the system in terms of the positron fluid quantities",
    ". it can be shown@xcite that all quantities can be expressed in terms of the electric field normalized to its largest amplitude @xmath21 : @xmath22 in the above , quantities with a zero subscript express the initial condition at zero phase , and the field reaches its largest amplitude at phase zero , @xmath23 . also , @xmath24 is the ratio of the ( constant ) magnetic field to the electric field amplitude , and @xmath25 is double the ratio at phase zero of the energy density in the particles to that in the electric field : @xmath26 the electric field @xmath27 can be computed from a first - order differential equation , which in the general case ( @xmath28 ) has no solution in closed form and has to be numerically integrated .",
    "the phase - averaged values of the above quantities , then , can also be calculated numerically ( for details see ref .  ) .",
    "there are four conserved quantities in a pulsar wind , in the plane wave approximation .",
    "these are the phase - averaged @xmath10components of the particle , energy , momentum and magnetic flux densities .",
    "we will denote the particle flux by @xmath29 , while the energy and momentum flux densities are the @xmath30 and @xmath31 components of the combined stress - energy four - tensor of fields and particles .",
    "finally , the magnetic flux density can be replaced ( from faraday s law ) by the phase - averaged electric field , so that the last conserved quantity can be written as @xmath32 .",
    "from these four quantitites we can construct three dimensionless ones , defined as @xmath33 @xmath34@xmath35    the first of these , @xmath36 , is the energy per unit mass that each particle would have , if the entire energy flux were carried by the particles .",
    "the three quantities ( [ mugeneral])-([etageneral ] ) are conserved across a layer that marks the transition between the striped wind and the superluminal wave , and therefore they have to be expressed in terms of the quantities characterizing these modes . for the striped wind",
    "we have : @xmath37(\\gamma^2 - 1)^{-1/2 } \\\\",
    "\\eta & = & b^2\\gamma \\sigma \\beta \\label{etawind}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath0 is the wind magnetization and @xmath38 is the normalized dc component of the magnetic field .",
    "this quantity is zero at the equatorial plane , where regions of alternating field are equal in width and cancel out in the phase average , and rises to its maximum value , @xmath39 , at latitude equal to the inclination angle @xmath6 , where the alternating field component disappears .",
    "the same quantities @xmath36 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 can be calculated for the superluminal wave .",
    "since our treatment of these modes took place in the h - frame , we calculate the quantities @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 and transform them to the laboratory frame using the velocity @xmath13 , as explained above .    equating eqns .",
    "( [ mugeneral])-([etageneral ] ) calculated for the superluminal mode to eqns .",
    "( [ muwind])-([etawind ] ) , one can find `` jump conditions '' for the transition from the striped wind to the superluminal mode , for certain values of @xmath5 , @xmath0 and latitude , or equivalently @xmath38 .",
    "we can then re - introduce the conservation of particle flux into our system of equations , in order to find the radial dependence of these jump conditions@xcite .",
    "in fig .  [ f1 ] we have plotted as a function of normalized radius @xmath47 the inverse hyperbolic tangent of the refractive index @xmath48 of the wave into which a striped wind with @xmath49 and @xmath50 can convert .",
    "the quantity @xmath51 is a dimensionless parameter given by : @xmath52where by @xmath53 the distribution of the pulsar s luminosity in solid angle @xmath54 is meant and @xmath55 is the colatitude ( i.e. the polar angle ) .",
    "we have assumed that the distribution of the pulsar s luminosity follows the prescription @xmath56and separated the angular dependence from @xmath57 .    as we can see in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , there is a minimum normalized distance @xmath58 outside which superluminal waves can propagate . for @xmath59 , @xmath60 , but it rises as one goes to higher latitudes . on the plot on the right of fig .",
    "[ f1 ] the phase averaged lorentz factor of the particles , @xmath61 is shown for the same values of @xmath38 . from this plot",
    "it is seen that during the conversion from one wave to another , energy is transferred from fields to particles . in the striped wind the lorentz factor of each particle",
    "is equal to the bulk lorentz factor of the outflow , which in the plotted example is @xmath62 .",
    "however , in the superluminal wave , for low values of @xmath38 , @xmath63 , which means that almost all the energy of the outflow is now carried by particles . even for values of @xmath38 close to unity , @xmath64 , meaning that the particles get accelerated in the whole wind , and the ratio of the poynting to the kinetic energy flux decreases during the transition from the subluminal to the superluminal regime .    in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , the geometrical critical surface is shown ( radius normalized as @xmath65 ) , outside which superluminal waves can propagate , for different values of the inclination @xmath6 .",
    "superimposed on the critical surfaces is the example of a shock surface , the shape of which is taken from ref .  . the normalization of the shock radius in comparison to the critical radius in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] is arbitrary .",
    "generally it depends on the individual pulsar in question . for isolated pulsars like the crab and the vela ,",
    "the shock ( located at @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively@xcite ) is much farther out than the critical surface ( located at @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively ) for practically the whole of the wind . for pulsars in binary systems ,",
    "though , where the shock is pushed closer to the pulsar by the outflow from a companion star@xcite , it is possible that the critical surface is partly or entirely outside the shock , so that no superluminal waves can propagate . in highly eccentric systems ,",
    "the possibility arises that the termination shock migrates during one orbit from a location inside to one outside the critical surface , so that the characteristics of the wind just before the termination shock are orbitally modulated during one period of the system .",
    "we conclude that the conversion of the striped wind to a superluminal mode is possible in many objects , especially in isolated pulsars , and it is accompanied by an acceleration of the particles of the outflow to @xmath70 , which might influence the physics of particle acceleration and the structure of the termination shock ."
