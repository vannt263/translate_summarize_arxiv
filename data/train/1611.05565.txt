    "the total mass@xmath4energy of the universe can not be explained by the ordinary matter in the standard model of cosmology .",
    "dark matter , an invisible form of matter , is believed to make up a quarter of the energy density of the current universe .",
    "however , nobody knows what it is .",
    "various hypothetical particles have been proposed .",
    "as the most widely accepted hypothesis , it is composed of weakly - interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , which only interact through gravitational and weak forces and may be able to annihilate with each other ( or alternatively decay ) into stable high@xmath4energy particle pairs , including gamma rays , charged particles and neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the identification of these annihilation or decay products is the main goal of dark matter indirect detection experiments .    among various indirect search methods , observations of the gamma - ray sky",
    "have attracted wide attention during these years thanks to the successful and productive performance of the fermi large area telescope ( lat ) @xcite .",
    "intense dedicated researches have been carried out to catch the gamma - ray radiation from dark matter annihilation or decay utilizing the fermi - lat data towards many different observational targets , such as the dwarf spherical galaxies @xcite , galaxy clusters @xcite , the galactic center @xcite , and the extragalactic gamma - ray background @xcite . among these various targets ,",
    "the most promising are the galactic center for its high density of dark matter and the dwarf spherical galaxies ( dsphs ) for the low astrophysical gamma@xmath4ray backgrounds .",
    "however so far no reliable dark matter signal has been identified @xcite .",
    "the joint analysis of fifteen dwarf spheroidal galaxies sets the most stringent constraint on cross section of dm annihilating through @xmath2 and @xmath5 channels @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on dark matter subhalos .",
    "n - body simulations reveal that dark matter structures form hierarchically , i.e. , the dark matter gathers together to form small halos , and then small halos merge repeatedly to create ever larger systems @xcite . as a consequence of this process , a milky way - like galaxy is predicted to host tens of thousands of galactic dm subhalos @xcite .",
    "the most massive ones of these subhalos are expected to host the known dsphs , while some small subhalos may completely lack any astrophysical counterparts for no significant quantity of baryonic matter",
    ". however , some of these small subhalos , if still massive enough and close enough to the earth , may generate detectable gamma - rays , observed as a group of unidentified gamma@xmath4ray sources .",
    "for example , assuming a dark matter particle mass of @xmath6 gev and an annihilation cross section of @xmath7 , fermi - lat might have recorded @xmath8 dark matter subhalos @xcite . to further distinguish between the unidentified astrophysical sources and the dark matter subhalos , the spatial extension likely plays an important role since a spatially - extended stable source without any association in other wavelengths is hard to be explained in astrophysical scenarios @xcite .",
    "consequently , we consider the unidentified stable gamma - ray sources with extendible structure at a confidence level of @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) as dm subhalo candidates",
    ".    there are 3033 sources included in the third fermi large area telescope source list ( 3fgl ) @xcite .",
    "992 of them have not been identified in other wavelengths . in a recent study @xcite , bertoni et al .",
    "searched for dark matter subhalo candidates among the unidentified , stable and bright ( i.e. , with the gamma - ray flux @xmath11 when integrated above 1 gev ) gev sources at high galactic latitudes ( @xmath12 ) . as a more complete investigation",
    ", we have analyzed the spatial and temporal characteristics for all unidentified stable sources with galactic latitudes @xmath13 in the 3fgl . in total",
    "there are two dark matter subhalo candidates , 3fgl j1924.8 - 1034 and 3fgl j2212.5 + 0703 , have been identified in our analysis . since 3fgl j2212.5",
    "+ 0703 has already been discussed in great detail in literature @xcite , in this work we focus on the unidentified gamma - ray source 3fgl j1924.8 - 1034 .",
    "to study the variability , spectrum and morphology of 3fgl j1924.8 - 1034 , we use 94 months of pass 8 lat data from 2008 aug 27 ( met = 239500801s ) to 2016 jun 01 ( met = 486432004s ) in the source event class with the standard conversion - type ( front+back ) selection .",
    "photons with energy range between 300 mev and 300 gev are taken into consideration .",
    "3fgl j1924.8 - 1034 at the galactic latitudes ( @xmath14 ) is close to the galactic disk , and the photons below 300 mev is contaminated by the diffuse galactic emission .",
    "the zenith angle cut @xmath15 is applied to reduce the contribution from earth limb and we adopt the recommended quality - filter cuts ( data_qual>0 and lat_config==1 ) to extract the good time intervals",
    ". then we create @xmath16 regions of interest ( roi ) centered on ( ra , dec , j2000 ) = ( @xmath17 ) @xcite and perform a standard binned likelihood analysis with @xmath18 spatial bins and 30 logarithmic energy bins .",
    "fermi science tools v10r0p5 and instrument response functions ( irfs ) p8r2_source_v6 are used for this analysis , which are available from the fermi science support center .    utilizing the user - contributed script make3fglxml.py",
    ", we make our model as a combination of the latest model for diffuse galactic gamma - ray emission ( gll_iem_v06.fits ) , the latest isotropic emission for the source photon data selection ( iso_p8r2_source_v6_v06.txt ) and all 3fgl sources found within a @xmath19 of our region of interest ( roi ) .",
    "we free the normalizations and spectral indexes of all sources within @xmath20 from the target source and the normalizations of the two diffuse emission backgrounds in the maximum likelihood fit . to perform the fit and get a optimized model",
    ", we use the fermi - lat @xmath21 code , utilizing the _ minuit _ algorithm @xcite .",
    "the default setting for the spectral model of 3fgl j1924.8 - 1034 is * powerlaw * in the 3fgl @xcite . when changing the spectral model to _ plsuperexpcutoff _ , we find a better fit is achieved at the @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) level .",
    "therefore , in the following analysis , we take _ plsuperexpcutoff _ as the spectral shape of 3fgl j1924.8 - 1034 .",
    "then we derive a @xmath24 test statistic ( ts ) map by placing a test point source at the location of each pixel of the map and maximizing the likelihood which is implemented in the @xmath25 tool .",
    "the ts is defined as @xmath26 following @xcite , where @xmath27 is the maximum likelihood value for a model without an additional source ( the null hypothesis ) and @xmath28 is for a model with that additional source(the alternative hypothesis ) .",
    "we find two new point sources with a ts value larger than 25 and add them to our model with power - law spectra located at the corresponding positions on the ts map . with the help of _ gtfindsrc _ , we find the optimized positions of the target source 3fgl j1924.8 - 1034 and two new added sources shown in tab.[tb1 ] .",
    ".the optimized positions of the target source and two new additional sources . [ cols=\"<,>,>,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      considering that 3fgl only used 4 years fermi lat data , there is a need to check whether the signal from 3fgl j1924.8 - 1034 has been stable for almost 8 years ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "to calculate the light curve of 3fgl j1924.8 - 1034 , we divide these photons into 16 equal time bins .",
    "we fix all the parameters except the spectrum of the target source in the optimized model .",
    "then this model is fitted to selected datasets independently to optimize flux in each time bins.the light curve in each time bin is shown in fig.[lc ] . to test the variability of 3fgl j1924.8 - 1034",
    ", a variability index is constructed as @xcite ,    @xmath29    @xmath30 is the value of the likelihood in the i@xmath4th bin under the null hypothesis where the source flux is constant across the full period and @xmath31 is the constant flux for the this hypothesis , while @xmath32 is the value under the alternate hypothesis where the flux in the i@xmath4th bin is optimized . for each time bin ,",
    "the photon flux over the full energy range ( 300 mev to 300 gev ) is @xmath33 , and its statistical error is @xmath34 . and we take @xmath35 as the systematic correction factor @xcite .    if the null hypothesis is correct , @xmath36 is distributed as @xmath37 with 15 degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "we find @xmath38 and the alternative hypothesis has a low significance of 0.82@xmath39 .",
    "so the null hypothesis is reasonable and 3fgl j1924.8 - 1034 is an non - variable source .          according to the ts map without 3fgl j1924.8 - 1034 in fig.[tsmap ] ,",
