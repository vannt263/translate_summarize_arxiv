    "the late - time cosmic accelerated expansion @xcite has posed important and challenging problems to theoretical cosmology .",
    "although the standard model of cosmology has favored dark energy models @xcite as fundamental candidates responsible for the accelerated cosmic expansion , it is also viable that this expansion is due to modifications of general relativity @xcite , which introduce new degrees of freedom to the gravitational sector itself .",
    "indeed , the phenomenology of @xmath0 gravity has been scrutinized motivated by the possibility to account for the self - accelerated cosmic expansion without invoking dark energy sources @xcite . besides , this kind of modified gravity is capable of addressing the dynamics of several self - gravitating systems alternatively to the presence of dark matter @xcite .",
    "a palatini version of the theory has been proposed @xcite , and it has been established that both metric and palatini versions of these theories have interesting features but also manifest severe and different downsides @xcite .",
    "a hybrid combination of theories containing elements from both these two formalisms @xcite , turns out to be also very successful accounting for the observed phenomenology and is able to avoid some drawbacks of the original approaches .",
    "more specifically , this hybrid metric - palatini theory consists of adding to the einstein - hilbert lagrangian an @xmath1 term constructed  la palatini @xcite . using the respective dynamically equivalent scalar - tensor representation ,",
    "it was shown that the theory can pass the solar system observational constraints even if the scalar field is very light .",
    "this implies the existence of a long - range scalar field , which is able to modify the cosmological and galactic dynamics , but leaves the solar system unaffected . the absence of instabilities in perturbations were also verified @xcite , and it was also shown that the initial value problem can always be well - formulated and be well - posed depending on the adopted matter sources @xcite",
    "the theory was further generalized to depend on a general function of both the metric and palatini curvature scalars @xcite .",
    "therefore the model predicts the existence of a long - range scalar field , modifying the cosmological and galactic dynamics @xcite , see @xcite for a review .",
    "the cosmological applications of the hybrid metric - palatini gravitational theory were extensively explored @xcite , and cosmological solutions coming from the scalar - tensor representation were presented . in particular , considering linear homogeneous perturbations , the stability regions of the einstein static universe were analyzed , and it was shown that a large class of stable solutions exists @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the cosmological perturbation equations were derived and applied to uncover the nature of the propagating scalar degree of freedom and the signatures these models predict in the large - scale structure @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the full set of linearized evolution equations for the perturbed potentials , in the newtonian and synchronous gauges , were derived .",
    "it was concluded that the main deviations from general relativity arise in the distant past , with an oscillatory signature in the ratio between the newtonian potentials @xcite .",
    "furthermore , using specific models and a combination of cosmic microwave background , supernovae and baryonic acoustic oscillations background data , it was shown that the model s free parameters are in agreement with the observational constraints @xcite .",
    "reconstruction methods were first employed in @xcite in order to select the form for the inflation potential able to resolve the open problems of the inflationary paradigm , e.g. , the graceful exit .",
    "ellis and madsen @xcite proposed an elegant way to approach the problem in the case of a minimally coupled scalar field . in the following years",
    "many attempts were made to generalize this approach to nonminimally coupled scalar - tensor theories with a single scalar field @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we devise a new reconstruction algorithm for multiscalar - tensor theories in the friedmann - lematre - robsertson - walker ( flrw ) universe , and we apply it to the scalar - tensor representation of generalized hybrid metric - palatini gravity in which the gravity lagrangian is given by a function @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this theory provides a very rich structure in astrophysical and cosmological applications .",
    "this paper is organized in the following manner : in sec .",
    "[ sec : action ] , we present the formalism of the generalized hybrid metric - palatini gravity , and express the action in the scalar - tensor representation . in sec .",
    "[ seciii ] , we consider the cosmological dynamics of flrw spacetimes , using the scalar - tensor representation of the hybrid theory . in sec .",
    "[ seciv ] , we obtain , from the solutions found in the scalar - tensor representation , the specific forms for @xmath3 . in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] , we conclude .",
    "consider the action of the generalized hybrid metric - palatini modified theory of gravity , given by ( the velocity of light is set to one ) [ genac ] s=_f(r,)d^4x+s_m , where @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the gravitational constant , @xmath6 is the determininant of the metric @xmath7 , @xmath8 is a function of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the matter action .",
    "@xmath9 is the metric ricci scalar and @xmath12 is the palatini scalar curvature , with @xmath13 being defined in terms of an independent connection @xmath14 as , _ ab=_c^c_ab-_b ^c_ac+^c_cd^d_ab-^c_ad ^d_cb .",
    "one can also use the additional independent connection as a building block to construct higher order curvature invariants , in the action @xmath15 , where the term @xmath16 , can take the following forms @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , etc .",
    "however we will not consider these cases here .",
    "relative to the presence of ostrogradski instabilities , in the hybrid theory , like in @xmath0-gravity , it is possible to avoid the problem by allowing a separation of the additional degrees of freedom into a harmless scalar degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "in fact , it turns out that this feature is a similar exception in the larger space of metric - affine theories , where a generic theory is plagued by ghosts , superluminalities and other unphysical degrees of freedom @xcite .    varying the action ( [ genac ] ) with respect to the metric @xmath7 and the independent connection , yields the following field equations r_ab+_ab - g_abf(r , ) + -(_a_b - g_ab)=^2 t_ab , and _",
    "c(g^ab)=0 , [ indconnnection ] respectively .",
    "the equation of motion ( [ indconnnection ] ) implies that the independent connection is the levi - civita connection of a new metric tensor @xmath22 which is conformally related to @xmath7 by the relation [ hgf ] h_ab = g_ab .",
    "the independent connection can then be written in terms of the new metric as ^a_bc = h^ad(_b h_dc+ _ c h_bd-_d h_bc ) .",
    "note that since the matter action @xmath11 does not depend on the independent connection @xmath23 , the equation of motion for this connection is independent of the stress - energy tensor , whereas the same does not happen to the equation of motion of the metric @xmath7 .",
    "it is useful to express the action   in a scalar - tensor representation .",
    "this can be achieved by considering an action with two auxiliary fields , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively , in the following form s=_d^4x+s_m .",
    "[ gensca ] putting @xmath26 and @xmath27 we recover action  . to proceed , we define two scalar fields as [ phidef ] = , [ psidef ] = - , where the negative sign in eq .",

    "the action equivalent to ( [ gensca ] ) is of the form s=_d^4x+s_m , [ action3 ] where the variation of the matter action @xmath11 with respect to the metric @xmath7 yields the stress - energy tensor @xmath29 .",
    "it is important to stress that in this representation the scalar fields are not actually matter fields and consequently they are allowed to assume values , such as negative ones , which would not be physically valid .",
    "this range of values corresponds in the generalized hybrid gravity picture to some specific behavior of the derivatives of the function @xmath8 in the action .",
    "this said , it should be also clear that zeros for the scalar fields are problematic points in terms of the relation between the representations . in the following , the solutions we will obtain are only valid in the interval between the zeroes of the scalar fields . in addition , it should be remarked that the scalar field representation will only be meaningful provided that @xmath9 and @xmath10 can be expressed in terms of the scalar fields .",
    "this is not the case for all forms of the function @xmath8 . in the next sections we will show some examples in which the consequences of these limitations become important .",

    "this fact will have important consequences when we will look for cosmological solutions in which matter is present .",

    "it is useful to obtain the form of the function @xmath121 in all the previous cases as the scalar - tensor form of the theory is only a derived form and used to provide an easier platform to perform the calculations . to obtain @xmath121",
    ", we are going to use the definition of the potential given by eq .  .",
    "if we replace here the definitions of the scalar fields given in eqs .   and  , we obtain a partial differential equation for @xmath8 as [ difpot ] v(f_r , f_)=-f(r,)+f_r r+f _ , where the subscripts @xmath9 and @xmath10 represent derivatives with respect to these variables , respectively .    as we have seen in the previous section the solutions for the scalar field can have zeros and assume a negative sign .",
    "while this does not compromise the physical meaning of the solution in the generalized hybrid gravity picture ( in this picture the scalar fields are not real matter fields ) it can lead to further constraints on the form of the action .",

    ", the derivatives of the function @xmath8 remain the same for the new variables and the equation can be written in a simpler manner as @xmath126 which has a general solution of the form @xmath127 , where @xmath6 is an arbitrary function .",

    ", we recover the result @xmath122 for the potential and , consequently , the solutions for the scalar fields are the ones obtained in section  [ method1 ] .    however , not all forms of the function @xmath6 can be used to obtain the correct solutions .",
    "take for example a function @xmath6 of a power - law form , i.e. , @xmath128 , where the exponent @xmath129 is a number .",
    "this form of the function @xmath6 is compatible with eq .",
    "but it does not possess the solution we have reconstructed .",
    "this is due to the fact that the relationship between the scalar fields and the ricci scalars given by @xmath130 and @xmath131 can not be inverted to obtain @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "the equivalence between the metric and the scalar - tensor representations breaks down and one can not immediately say that the theory will have the solutions reconstructed .",

    "[ method2 ] is given by @xmath134 , a constant .",
    "we can then write eq .   as f(r,)=f_r r+f",
    "this equation has a general solution of the form [ solconst ] f(r,)=-v_0+g()r , where @xmath6 is again an arbitrary function . as an example , let us consider a function @xmath6 of the form g()= ( ) . this exponential form allows us to invert the relation between the scalar fields and the ricci tensors given by @xmath135 and @xmath131 to obtain @xmath132 and @xmath136 , and therefore we recover the constant potential @xmath70 and the solutions for the scalar fields presented in section  [ method2 ] .",
    "interestingly , in this case the power - law form for the function @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath137 , also allows to invert the relation between the scalar fields and the ricci tensors .",
    "the simple potential obtained in sec .  [ method3 ] is given by @xmath138 , see eq .",
    "( [ potiispec ] ) .",

    "these solutions were generalizations of the solutions obtained in secs .",
    "[ method1 ] and  [ method2 ] , where the potentials were given by @xmath122 and @xmath134 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the solutions for the function @xmath8 remain the same , given by eqs .   and   respectively .",
    "in this paper , we devised a number of reconstruction strategies to obtain new exact cosmological solutions in the context of the generalized hybrid metric - palatini gravity .",
    "this theory can be recast in a scalar - tensor theory with two scalar fields whose solutions can be computed analytically for a convenient choice of the potential or the scale factor . using the new methods we obtained a number of physically interesting solutions including power - law and exponential scale factors .",
    "such solutions assume a particular relevance as they can be achieved either in vacuum or with a given matter distribution .",
    "this feature implies that in this framework a negligible matter distribution still gives rise to expansion laws which are compatible with the observations without requiring the total baryonic matter to be a relevant percentage of the total energy density .",
    "it is also interesting to note that our results imply that hybrid metric - palatini gravity can generate a de sitter evolution without the appearance of an explicit cosmological constant in the action .",
    "instead , the presence of such a constant leads , throughout our method , to solutions which are radiation - like ( see examples two and five ) .",
    "this result gives us information on the properties of effective dark fluid related to the non hilbert - einstein terms present in these theory .",
    "it also implies , by the cosmological no - hair theorem , that these solutions should be unstable .",
    "the stability of the other solutions we have found can not be obtained with the same ease .",
    "this is a limitation of the reconstruction in general .",
    "it allows to obtain some exact solution but it does not offer information on their stability .    in conclusion , our study suggests that the `` hybrid '' theory space is a priori large and requires further investigation not only in terms of the exploration of the solution space , but also in terms of the stability of these solutions .",
