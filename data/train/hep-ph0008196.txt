    "the standard electroweak model provides a very satisfactory description of most elementary particle phenomena up to the presently available energies . however , there are some unsatisfactory features as the family number and their complex pattern of masses and mixing angles , which are not predicted by the model . in addition , the recently emerged experimental data on the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xcite , solar and atmospheric neutrinos @xcite strongly suggest physics beyond the standard model",
    ". searches on new fermions can reveals some directions for the solution of these problems .",

    "are not required , since the lepton representation content of each su(3)@xmath13 triplet consists of one charged lepton , its charge conjugated counterpart and the associated neutrino field @xcite .",
    "however , the version of the model which we work here differs from the original one , in that the charge conjugated lepton fields of the original model are replaced by heavy - leptons in the su(3)@xmath13 triplets@xcite .",
    "the most interesting feature of this class of models is related with the anomaly cancellations , which is implemented only when the three fermion families are considered together and not family by family as in the standard model .",

    "the process for the heavy - lepton production in hadronic colliders was well studied in the literature and was shown that the dominant contribution are the well known drell - yan process ( fig .",
    "1a ) and gluon - gluon fusion ( fig .",
    "1b ) @xcite .",
    "we present the cross section for the process @xmath188 , involving the drell - yan mechanism and the gluon - gluon fusion , to produce the 3 - 3 - 1 heavy - leptons . in fig .",
    "5 we show the different cross sections for different masses of neutral boson @xmath89 , @xmath189 and @xmath157 . we see that the drell - yan and the gluon - gluon fusion production are suppressed for @xmath190 where the @xmath83 , the @xmath154 and @xmath157 later must produce the heavy - lepton pairs . this figure still exhibit the resonance peaks associated with the boson @xmath89 and the two neutral higgs bosons .",
    "considering that the expected integrated luminosity for the lhc will be of order of @xmath191 pb@xmath192/yr and taking the mass of the heavy - lepton equal to 300 gev , it could be seen in the lhc , that the drell - yan production dominates over gluon - gluon fusion .",

    "this figure exhibits that the heavy - lepton can be short - lived for the masses of the boson @xmath210 here considered .",
    "the main background for the signal , @xmath214 , could comes from the process @xmath215 , but this background can be eliminated by measuring the undetected neutrino contribution @xmath216 , since all hadrons with appreciable @xmath217 are detected .",
