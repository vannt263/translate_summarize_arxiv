    "recently , @xcite suggested on the basis of two - dimensional models of ecsne that a weak @xmath0-process could lead to the production of trans - iron elements in the early neutron - rich convective blobs of such sne , but no heavier than @xmath11 .",

    "as we will see below , however , the ejecta from the outer region dominate the total amount ( @xmath104 ;   3 ) .",
    "it is also important to note , taking our injection timescale condition seriously , that the outer - torus region beyond @xmath3  km is not expected to contribute significantly to the total ejecta mass because of long injection timescales .",

    "the dynamics of outflows from bh tori will be highly dependent on neutrino transport as well as magnetic fields , which are to be explored in future studies of hyperaccreting bhs .",
    "this did not allow @xcite to describe mass loss from the tori by energy transfer and deposition associated with neutrino transport , nor did their models adequately account for magnetically - driven mass loss . outflows and winds",
    "were previously discussed by @xcite , although all of those works did not employ self - consistent hydrodynamical models of this phenomenon .",
    "as mentioned in   1 , recent hydrodynamical simulations of ccsne predict that the pns wind is proton - rich @xcite .",
    "the bh - torus wind from `` collapsars '' @xcite resulting from collapsing rapidly rotating stellar cores is also suggested to be proton - rich ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the bh - torus from ns - ns and bh - ns mergers , originating from decompressed , very neutron - rich ns matter , is different from the collapsar case .",
    "the initially neutron - rich torus leads to more production of @xmath33 by @xmath63 captures on neutrons , @xmath105 than @xmath32 production by @xmath62 captures on protons , @xmath106 and thus one obtains @xmath107 .",
    "this allows the bh - torus wind ( outside of the torus at lower densities ) to remain neutron - rich owing to more @xmath33 captures on free protons , @xmath108 than @xmath32 captures on free neutrons , @xmath109 however , despite the fact that the neutrinospheric layers in a pns are also neutron - rich , the simulations cited above show that pnss produce essentially equal luminosities of @xmath32 and @xmath33 , resulting in the proton - richness of the ejecta because of the neutron - proton mass difference , which reduces @xmath33 captures compared to @xmath32 captures .",
    "so what exactly is the difference between the pns and merger bh - torus cases ? this can be explained as follows .    for pnss ,",
    "the main point is the fact that the pns is in a phase of _ neutronization_. it evolves from more proton - rich ( symmetric ) initial conditions to more neutron - rich final conditions .",
    "in course of this transition , its core radiates more @xmath32 than @xmath33 ( see eqs .  ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ) . on their radial way out of the pns through highly neutrino - opaque layers",
    "this initial @xmath32 flux is converted into equal @xmath32 and @xmath33 fluxes by multiple absorption and reemission processes ( and @xmath110 and @xmath78 fluxes of similar size ) .",
    "the escaping @xmath32 and @xmath33 luminosities are roughly equal because the neutrinospheric layers with their typical densities ( @xmath111  g  @xmath36 initially and up to @xmath112  g  @xmath36 at very late times ) reach their so - called  @xmath113-equilibrium \" state ( defined by equal number production of @xmath32 and @xmath33 and @xmath114 const . in time ) within some tens of milliseconds up to about @xmath115  ms .",
    "this is much shorter than the pns cooling timescale of seconds . on the long pns evolution",
    "timescale the emission is therefore mostly characterized by essentially equal @xmath116 and @xmath117 ( with a small difference making sure that there is a net @xmath32-flux out of the still neutronizing high - density pns core ) .",
    "in contrast , the hot post - merger torus is composed of decompressed neutron star matter .",
    "it starts out from a very neutron rich initial state and ( on its way to a new @xmath113-equilibrium condition ) _ protonizes _ gradually ( eq .  ( 1 ) ) because of overall lower densities than it had initially . since the density and temperature of the torus ( on average some @xmath38@xmath118  g  @xmath36 and about 310  mev ) are very similar to the neutrinospheric conditions of a pns , the protonization of the torus proceeds on the same timescale as the neutronization of the neutrinospheric region in the pns case . as mentioned above , this typical timescale is tens of milliseconds at the given densities , presumably up to @xmath3  ms .",
    "this is exactly a major fraction of the accretion timescale of most of the torus mass into the bh ( and is the timescale for the protonization assumed in our simple model described in ",
    "because of the protonization , @xmath117 is higher than @xmath116 , in inverse analogy to the fact that @xmath116 is higher in the case of a collapsing stellar core during the early times when the postshock layer is still on its way to reach the @xmath113-equilibrium condition , starting out from a nearly symmetric initial state .",
    "for this reason , the neutrino - driven ejecta from the bh - torus are expected to be neutron - rich ( see eqs .  ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) ) for a significant duration of the wind phase .",
    "note that a direct consequence of the fact that the torus conditions in density and temperature are roughly similar to the neutrinospheric conditions in a pns is the finding that the @xmath110 and @xmath78 neutrino luminosities are 510 times lower than the @xmath32 and @xmath33 luminosities in the case of the tori ( see * ? ? ?",

    "these should be tested by future long - time hydrodynamical simulations of ns - ns and bh - ns merging events and of the evolution of their remnants .",
    "note that , even if the production of @xmath0-elements heavier than @xmath6 is marginal as found in case  2 , our model could be a possible explanation for the abundance distribution found in an @xmath0-process deficient star hd  122563 with [ fe / h ] @xmath269 ( open circles ; scaled to match the calculated eu abundance , * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that ns - ns and bh - ns mergers could at least be the origin of some trans - iron elements up to @xmath270 ( @xmath11 ) .    for an observational support",
    ", future modeling of the galactic @xmath0-element evolution that is not in conflict with spectroscopic results of metal - deficient stars will be important ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , radioactive decays of @xmath0-processed ejecta can lead to faint sn - like transients @xcite .",
    "future detections of such signals , possibly as accompanying events of short grbs , will be a direct support for the occurrence of @xmath0-processing in ns - ns and bh - ns mergers . according to the estimates by @xcite , a peak luminosity of @xmath271  erg  s@xmath9",
    "could be expected from the bh - wind ejecta with @xmath272 ( roberts et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , however , obtained only slightly higher r - band luminosities for considerably higher ejecta masses ) .",
    "it will be difficult to distinguish the wind component from the early , tidally ejected counterpart . both could contain similar amounts of radioactive matter",
    ". however , the velocities as well as the geometry of the @xmath0-processed ejecta might be distinctive between them .",
    "our result implies that the @xmath0-processed bh - wind ejecta reach out widely from the torus with velocities of @xmath84 ( except for the innermost region , figs .  6 and 11 ) .",
    "in contrast , tidal ejecta come from the tips of ( one or two ) spiral arms , and are expected to achieve larger outgoing velocities ( @xmath273 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these could lead to some different features in the light curves ( e.g. , line profiles or the time of the peak ) , potentially distinguishable by observations .",
    "we investigated @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis in the neutrino - driven outflows from a bh accretion torus ( bh - torus winds ) formed in ns - ns ( or bh - ns ) mergers .",
    "different from previous works @xcite we investigated a time- and space - dependent semi - analytic model setup .",
    "the bh - torus wind models were constructed by considering spherically symmetric , general relativistic neutrino - driven wind solutions @xcite with the gravitational potential of a central bh of @xmath17 .",
    "the bh accretion torus ( around a rotating bh ) was assumed to lie between @xmath222 and @xmath54 ( @xmath274  km ) from the center .",
    "each wind trajectory reaching away from the torus was obtained by assuming a hypothetical neutrinosphere in the spherical wind model with the radius @xmath26 .    in the innermost wind region ( @xmath275 ) , the efficient energy deposition due to @xmath65 pair annihilation to @xmath276 pairs leads to very high entropies ( @xmath277@xmath278 per nucleon ) and short expansion timescales ( @xmath27910  ms ) .",
    "this allows for a strong @xmath0-process regardless of @xmath28 ( even with @xmath280 when @xmath281  ms , * ? ? ? * ) or no production of heavy elements ( in the relativistic winds with @xmath282 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the small mass ejection from the innermost torus makes this contribution to the total nucleosynthetic abundances essentially negligible . in the outer wind regions ( @xmath283 ) , on the other hand , the dominant heating is due to @xmath59 and @xmath60 captures on free nucleons as in the case of pns winds , resulting in modest entropies ( @xmath169 ) and expansion timescales ( @xmath170  ms ) .",
    "low @xmath28 values ( @xmath267 at @xmath191 ) are thus essential for a strong @xmath0-process .",
    "the contribution from outer wind regions dominates the total nucleosynthetic abundances because of their greater mass ejection rates .",
    "note that our bh - torus model does not predict a @xmath34@xmath284-process @xcite as suggested in the case of ( proton - rich ) collapsar disk winds @xcite .",
    "the mass - integrated nucleosynthetic abundances , obtained with a phenomenological time evolution of neutrino luminosities , are in good agreement with the solar @xmath0-pattern over the entire @xmath0-process range of @xmath285 , when the neutrino - matter interactions are considered only for @xmath201 ( case  1 ) .",
    "this can be taken as the optimal case for strong @xmath0-processing in our models .",
    "however , when @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 captures on free nucleons are taken into account also for @xmath198 ( case  2 ) , the production of heavy @xmath0-elements beyond @xmath6 drops off steeply .",
    "the total ejecta mass of the bh - torus wind of our simplified model is calculated to be @xmath286 , in which the @xmath0-processed matter dominates ( @xmath287 ) . provided that our bh - torus wind model is representative",
    ", ns - ns and bh - ns mergers can produce all ( or at least a significant part of ) the galactic @xmath0-abundances if the event rate ( averaged over the galactic history ) was @xmath288  yr@xmath9 , which is consistent with the upper bound of present ( solar - metallicity ) population synthesis results ( @xmath13@xmath14  yr@xmath9 , * ? ? ? * ) and of statistical results based on binary pulsar surveys ( @xmath261@xmath14  yr@xmath9 , * ? ? ?",
    "this implies that bh - torus winds from ns - ns and/or bh - ns mergers could be major ( or partial ) production sites of the @xmath0-process elements in the galaxy .",
    "it should be noted that the actual ejecta mass of @xmath0-abundances could be substantially higher than the estimate based on our bh - torus wind model , in which we do not consider any other effects than neutrino - driven outflows , namely , centrifugal force , magnetic fields , or tidally ejected neutron - rich matter from ns disruption .",
    "obviously , more elaborate hydrodynamical studies of the considered astrophysical site are needed to obtain information of the neutrino field that controls the dynamics as well as the neutron - richness in the bh - torus winds .",
    "note that ns - ns and bh - ns mergers are also suggested to be the sources of short grbs .",
    "an interesting possibility in this context is that the radioactive neutron - rich nuclei ejected during and after mergers might lead to detectable transient electromagnetic signals @xcite .",
    "studies of galactic chemical evolution will also be important to test the contributions of ns - ns and bh - ns mergers to the enrichment history of the @xmath0-process elements , in particular their role in the early galaxy .",
