    "in 1974 halperin , lubensky and ma ( hlm )  @xcite showed that the magnetic fluctuations change the order of the superconducting phase transition in a zero external magnetic field ( @xmath2 ) , i.e. , the order of the phase transition from normal - to - uniform ( meissner ) superconducting state at @xmath3 . in the mean - field approximation , when both magnetic and superconducting fluctuations are neglected , this phase transition is of second order ; see , e.g. , refs .",
    "moreover , the fluctuations @xmath4 $ ] of the superconducting order parameter @xmath5 towards the statistical average @xmath6 are extremely small and can be safely ignored in usual low - temperature ( @xmath7 k ) superconductors . for a long time",
    "these superconductors have been considered as an excellent example of a standard phase transition of second order described by the mean - field approximation . when the magnetic fluctuations are taken into account in the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) free energy @xmath8 of superconductor  @xcite , the same normal - to - superconducting phase transition in a zero ( mean ) external magnetic field @xmath9",
    "is found to be a weakly - first order phase transition with a very small latent heat which can not be observed by available experimental techniques  @xcite .",
    "the effect of a magnetic fluctuation change of the superconducting phase transition order , called hlm effect , is very weak in bulk ( three dimensional , or 3d ) superconductors even in al where the gl number @xmath10 is very small ( @xmath11 ) - a circumstance which is in favor of the effect  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we shall investigate this fluctuation - induced first order phase transition in thin ( quasi-2d ) superconducting films .",
    "bulk superconductors will be also discussed in order to compare them with the behavior of thin films .",
    "we shall use a self - consistent approximation  @xcite , in which the fluctuations @xmath12 of @xmath13 are neglected but the magnetic fluctuations are completely taken into account .",
    "note , that the so - called tree approximation  @xcite does not yield the hlm effect and the self - consistent , or mean - field - like , approximation , mentioned above , is the simplest analytical method for an investigation of this phenomenon .",
    "the present study is intended to provide enough theoretical results about the behavior of measurable physical quantities directly related to the phase transition properties and in this way to ensure a theoretical basis for future experiments on the existence of the hlm effect .",
    "the need of an experimental observation of the hlm effect is very important because the effect remains a theoretical paradigm without a reliable experimental verification although its mechanism - the interaction of gauge fields in a quite universal abelian - higgs model - is of fundamental interest for different fields of physics as pure  @xcite , and disordered  @xcite superconductors , quantum phase transitions  @xcite , scalar electrodynamics  @xcite , liquid crystals  @xcite , and cosmology  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "there are some theoretical studies , based on monte carlo simulations  @xcite , the so - called dual model  @xcite , and certain variants of the renormalization - group ( rg )  @xcite , in which no evidence of hlm effect was reported ; for a discussion of this point , see , the review article  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the modern theory of phase transitions the problem for the existence of hlm effect is controversial and can not be easily solved without a hint from the experiment .",
    "the experimental research of the effect in liquid crystals can not be considered reliable although the reported results are in favor of its existence .",
    "recently , it has been shown  @xcite that the hlm effect is stronger in quasi-2d superconducting films than in bulk superconductors and the preliminary evaluation of the relevant physical quantities like the order parameter jump and the latent heat at the equilibrium point of the fluctuation - induced first order transition in superconducting films gives for them several orders bigger values than for those in bulk materials  @xcite .",
    "this result reopens the problem for an experimental search of hlm effect in type i superconductors , in particular , in thin films of type i superconductors with relatively small gl parameter @xmath10 .",
    "here we shall investigate this problem in a comprehensive way .",
    "we shall neglect the fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter because their effect on the thermodynamics of the superconductor is very weak ; see , e.g. , refs .",

    "this approximation is adequate for superconductors of thickness @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the lattice constant and @xmath73 . as we suppose the external magnetic field to be zero @xmath74 or very small in real experiments , the requirement @xmath75 can not be satisfied and we take into account only the condition @xmath76 .    in microscopic models of periodic structures",
    "the periodic boundary conditions confine the wave vectors @xmath77 in the first brillouin zone @xmath78 $ ] and the expansion of their values beyond this zone can be made either by neglecting the periodicity of the crystal structure or on the basis of the assumption that big wave numbers @xmath79 have a negligible contribution to the calculated quantities .",
    "the last argument is widely accepted in the phase transitions theory where the long - wavelength @xmath80 limit can be used . in particular , this argument is valid in the continuum limit @xmath81 . therefore , for both crystal and nonperiodic structures we can use a cutoff @xmath82 and afterwards to extend this cutoff to infinity provided the main contributions in the summations over @xmath83 come from the relatively small wavenumbers @xmath84 .",
    "note , that here we make a quasimacroscopic description based on the gl functional  ( [ eq1 ] ) which means that the microscopic phenomena are excluded from our consideration .",
    "the gl free energy functional takes into account phenomena with characteristic lengths @xmath85 and @xmath86 or larger ( @xmath87 and @xmath70 ) where @xmath88 is the london penetration length mentioned above and @xmath89 is the coherence length  @xcite ; here @xmath90 is the zero - temperature coherence length . in low - temperature superconductors @xmath85 and @xmath86 are much bigger than the lattice constant @xmath72 . having in mind this argument",
    "we shall assume that in our investigation @xmath91 . whether the upper cutoff @xmath92 is chosen to be either @xmath93 or @xmath94 is a problem that has to be solved by additional arguments ( see sec .",

    "the fourier amplitude @xmath100 is not equal to @xmath101 because @xmath102 is a complex function .",
    "for the same reason @xmath103 is a complex number .",
    "the total ignoring of both superconducting and magnetic fluctuations in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) leads to the familiar free approximation where the gl equations  @xcite should be solved .",
    "note , that the free , or mean - field , approximation is the lowest order theory within the framework of the loop expansion , e.g. , see  @xcite .",
    "the systematic treatment of the fluctuation effects in the asymptotic vicinity of the phase transition point can be given by rg .",
    "the effect of the superconducting fluctuations @xmath104 on the phase transition properties is restricted in a negligibly small vicinity @xmath105 of the temperature @xmath59 and we shall assume that @xmath106 , i.e. , @xmath107 ; from now on we shall denote @xmath108 by @xmath13 .",
    "so we apply a mean - field approximation with respect to the order parameter @xmath109 . within this approximation",

    "the uniform value of @xmath13 is different from the mean - field value of @xmath13 because the uniform fluctuations of @xmath5 always exist , so we should choose one of these two possibilities .",
    "the problem for this choice arises after the calculation the integral  ( [ eq8 ] ) at a next stage of consideration when the effective free energy @xmath120 is analyzed and the properties of the superconducting phase @xmath121 are investigated . the effective free energy is a particular case of the effective thermodynamic potential in the phase transition theory  @xcite and we must treat the uniform @xmath13 in the way prescribed in the field theory of phase transitions .",
    "it will become obvious from the next discussion that we shall use a loop - like expansion which can be exactly summed up to give a logarithmic dependence on @xmath122 .    because of the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the continuous symmetry in the ground state , the ordered phase @xmath123 , i.e. , the effective free energies discussed in this paper depend on the modulus @xmath124 of the complex number @xmath125 but not on the phase angle @xmath126 which remains arbitrary .",
    "that is why we shall consider the modulus @xmath124 as an  effective order parameter \" because the angle @xmath126 does not play any role in the phenomena investigated in the paper .",

    "this equation gives the equilibrium value @xmath129 of @xmath13 and the difference @xmath130 - @xmath131 can be treated as the uniform ( zero dimensional ) fluctuation of the field @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath132-dependent fluctuations @xmath104 have been neglected because of the uniformity of @xmath13 .",
    "the solution @xmath129 will be stable towards the uniform fluctuation @xmath133 provided the same solution @xmath134 remains unspecified .",
    "therefore , we begin our investigation setting @xmath13 uniform but at some stage of consideration we shall also ignore the uniform fluctuation @xmath133 and deal only with the equilibrium value @xmath129 of @xmath13",
    ". the equilibrium value will be calculated after taking into account magnetic fluctuations , so it will be different from the usual result @xmath135  @xcite when both magnetic and superconducting fluctuations are ignored .",
    "this simplest approximation for the equilibrium value of @xmath13 is obtained from the gl free energy  ( [ eq1 ] ) provided @xmath136 and the gradient term is neglected .",
    "hereafter we shall keep the symbol @xmath127 for the equilibrium order parameter in the more general case when the magnetic fluctuations are not neglected and shall denote the same quantity for @xmath137 by @xmath138 .",
    "the above described approximation neglects the saddle point solutions of gl equations , where @xmath139 is @xmath132-dependent .",
    "therefore , the vortex state that is stable in type ii superconductors can not be achieved .",
    "this is consistent with the choice of a zero external magnetic field , where the vortex state can not occur in any type superconductor .",
    "these arguments can be easily verified with the help of gl equations  @xcite for a zero external magnetic field ; the only nonzero solution for @xmath13 in this case is given by @xmath140 although the magnetic fluctuations @xmath141 are properly considered .",
    "in conclusion we can argue that the described method will be convenient for both type i and type ii superconductors in a zero external magnetic field , provided the @xmath13-fluctuations have a negligibly small effect on phase transition properties @xmath142 , where @xmath143 denotes the phase transition line for any @xmath144 . for type ii superconductors in @xmath145 , two lines @xmath146 and",
