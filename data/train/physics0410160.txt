    "the collective dynamics of complex distributed systems often can be usefully described in terms of a superposition of rate processes or frequencies which determine the changes in macroscopically measurable variables as energy flows through the system ; that is , a dynamical model expressed as a system of coupled ordinary differential equations in a few averaged state variables or mode coefficients and several , independently tunable , parameters that represent physical properties or external controls .",
    "this type of reduced ( or low - order or low - dimensional ) modelling averages over space , mode spectrum structure , single - particle dynamics and other details , but the payoff lies in its amenity to sophisticated analytic theory and methods that enable us to track important qualitative features in the collective dynamics , such as singularities , bifurcations , and stability changes , broadly over the parameter space .    motivated by the need for improved guidance and control of the ( mostly bad ) behaviour of fusion plasmas in magnetic containers ,",
    "i elaborate in this work a case study in bifurcation and stability analysis in which reduced dynamical system modelling yields new global and predictive information about gradient driven turbulence ",
    "flow energetics that is complementary to direct numerical simulation and can guide experimental design .    reduced dynamical models are powerful tools for describing and analysing complex systems such as turbulent plasmas and fluids , primarily because they are supported by well - developed mathematics that gives qualitative and global insight , such as singularity , bifurcation , stability , and symmetry theory . in principle",
    "one can map analytically the bifurcation structure of the entire phase and parameter space of a reduced dynamical system , but this feat is not possible for an infinite - dimensional system , or partial differential equations , and not practicable for systems of high order .",
    "the usefulness of such models seems to be no coincidence , too : in turbulent systems generally , which in detail are both complex and complicated , the dynamics seems to take place in a low - dimensional subspace @xcite .",
    "it seems paradoxical that enthusiasm for low - dimensional modelling and qualitative analysis of fluid and plasma systems has paced the ever larger direct numerical simulations of their flow fields .",
    "this is an exemplar of how the simplexity and complicity @xcite juxtaposition can work well : these methods affirm each other , for both have common ground in the universal conservation equations for fluid flow ( as well as separate bases in mathematics and computational science ) . developments in one feed developments in  the  other .",
    "reduced dynamical models can give insights into the physics and dynamics of a system in a way that is complementary to brute - force numerical simulations of the detailed , spatially distributed models from which they are derived .",
    "in practice this complementarity means that low - order models ( which capture few or no spatial modes ) can be used to channel information gleaned from the generic , qualitative structure of the parameter space  attractors , critical points of onset , stability properties , and so on  to numerical simulations ( which contain all spatial modes but , on their own , bring little physical understanding ) , giving them purpose and meaning . in turn",
    "the fluid simulations serve as virtual experiments to validate the low - order approach .",
    "it is reasonable , therefore , to assert that improved low - dimensional dynamical models for plasmas and fluids could provide numerical experimenters with new and interesting challenges that will continue to push the limits of computational science and technology .",
    "fusion plasmas in magnetic containers , such as those in tokamak or stellarator experiments , are strongly driven nonequilibrium systems in which the kinetic energy of small - scale turbulent fluctuations can drive the formation of large - scale coherent structures such as shear and zonal flows .",
    "this inherent tendency to self - organize is a striking characteristic of flows where lagrangian fluid elements see a predominantly two - dimensional velocity field , and is a consequence of the inverse energy cascade @xcite .",
    "the distinctive properties of quasi two - dimensional fluid motion are the basis of natural phenomena such as zonal and coherent structuring of planetary flows , but are generally under - exploited in technology .    in plasmas the most potentially useful effect of two - dimensional fluid motion is suppression of high wavenumber turbulence that generates cross - field transport fluxes and degrades confinement @xcite .",
    "suppression of turbulent transport can manifest temporally as a spontaneous and more - or - less abrupt enhancement of sheared poloidal or zonal flows and concomitant damping of density fluctuations , and spatially as the rapid development of a localized transport barrier or steep density gradient .",
    "the phenomenon is often called low- to high - confinement ( l  h ) transitions and has been the subject of intensive experimental , _ in numero , _ and theoretical and modelling investigations since the 1980s .",
    "the large and lively primary literature on reduced dynamical models for confinement transitions and associated oscillations in plasmas represents a sort of consensus on the philosophy behind qualitative analysis , if not on the details of the models themselves .",
    "what motivates this approach is the predictive power that a unified , low - order description of the macroscopic dynamics would have in the management of confinement states . since it is widely acknowledged that control of turbulent transport is crucial to the success of the world - wide fusion energy program @xcite it is important to develop predictive models for efficient management of access to , and sustainment of , high confinement rgimes .",
    "for example , if one plans to maintain a high confinement state at a relatively low power input by exploiting the hysteresis in the transition it would be useful , not to mention cheaper , to know in advance which parameters control the shape and extent of hysteresis , or whether it can exist at all in the operating space of a particular system , or whether a transition will be oscillatory .    however , it has been shown @xcite that many of the models in the literature are structurally flawed . they often contain pathological or persistent degenerate ( higher order ) singularities .",
    "an associated issue is that of overdetermination , where near a persistent degenerate singularity there may be more defining equations than variables .",
    "consequently much of the discussion in the literature concerning confinement transitions is qualitatively wrong .",
    "* such models can not possibly have predictive power*.    the heart of the matter lies in the mapping between the bifurcation structure and stability properties of a dynamical model and the physics of the process it is supposed to represent : if we probe this relationship we find that degenerate singularities ought to correspond to some essential physics ( such as fulfilling a symmetry - breaking imperative , or the onset of hysteresis ) , or they are pathological . in the first case",
    "we can usually unfold the singularity in a physically meaningful way ; in the other case we know that something is amiss and we should revise our assumptions . degenerate",
    "singularities are good because they provide opportunities to improve a model and its predictive capabilities , but bad when they are not recognized as such .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    the literature on confinement transitions has two basic strands : ( 1 ) transitions are an internal , quasi two - dimensional flow , phenomenon and occur spontaneously when the rate of upscale transfer of kinetic energy from turbulence to shear and zonal flows exceeds the nonlinear dissipation rate @xcite ; ( 2 ) transitions are due to nonambipolar ion orbit losses near the plasma edge , the resulting electric field providing a torque which drives the poloidal shear flow nonlinearly @xcite .",
    "these two different views of the physics behind confinement transitions are smoothly reconciled for the first time in this work .",
    "a systematic methodology for characterizing the equilibria of dynamical systems involves finding and classifying high - order singularities then perturbing around them to explore and map the bifurcation landscape @xcite .",
    "broadly , this paper is about applying singularity theory as a diagnostic tool while an impasto picture of confinement transition dynamics is compounded .",
    "the bare - bones model is presented in section [ two ] in section [ three ] the global consequences of local symmetry - breaking are explored , leading to the discovery of an organizing centre and trapped degenerate singularities .",
    "this leads in to section [ four ] where i unfold a trapped singularity smoothly by introducing another layer that models the neglected physics of downscale energy transfer .",
    "section [ five ] follows the qualitative changes to the bifurcation and stability structure that are due to potential energy dissipative losses . in section [ six ]",

    "( rate - laws for bulk dynamical processes are not usually derivable purely from theory , and ultimately must be tested against experimental evidence . )    the rest of this paper is concerned with the character of the equilibria of eqs [ e2 ] and modifications and extensions to this system .",
    "we shall study the type , multiplicity , and stability of attractors , interrogate degenerate or pathological singularities where they appear , and classify and map the bifurcation structure of the system . in doing this",
    "we shall attempt to answer questions such as : are eqs [ e2 ] or modified versions a good  that is , predictive  model of the system ? does the model adequately reflect the known phenomenology of confinement transitions in fusion plasmas ? what is the relationship between the bifurcation properties of the model and the physics of confinement transitions ?",
    "the equilibrium solutions of eqs [ e2 ] are shown in the bifurcation diagrams of fig .",

    "thus for @xmath14 ( a poorly dissipative system ) the turning points in ( a ) appear and the system may also show oscillatory behaviour .",

    "the hysteresis is evident : if we backtrack a little the back transition takes place at a lower value of @xmath4 .",
    "continuing along the upper stable branch in @xmath7 we encounter another switch in stability ; this time at a hopf bifurcation to stable period one limit cycles .",
    "( in this and other diagrams the amplitude envelopes of limit cycle branches are marked by large solid dots . ) from the amplitude envelope we see that the oscillations grow as power is fed to the system then are extinguished rather abruptly , at a second hopf bifurcation where the solutions regain stability .",
    "the shear flow decreases toward zero as the pressure - dependent anomalous viscosity , the second term in eq .",
    "[ e2d ] , takes over to dissipate the energy at high power input .",
    "the system may also be evolved to an equilibrium on the antisymmetric , @xmath25 branch in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ]  ( a ) , by choosing initial conditions appropriately or a large enough kick . however , if the power input then falls below the turning point at @xmath26 we see an interesting phenomenon : the shear flow spontaneously reverses direction",
    ". the transient would nominally take the system toward the nearest stable attractor , the lower @xmath27 branch , but since it would then be sitting very close to the lower @xmath27 turning point small stochastic fluctuations could easily induce the transition to the higher @xmath27 branch .",
    "see the inset zoom - in over this region in ( a ) .",
    "here is an example of a feature that is unusual in bifurcation landscapes , a domain over which there is fivefold multiplicity comprising three stable and two unstable equilibria .",
    "two more examples of threefold stable domains will be shown in section [ five ]    the same equilibria depicted using @xmath0 and @xmath1 as dynamical variables in ( b ) and ( c ) are annotated to indicate whether they correspond to the @xmath27 or @xmath25 domain . for clarity",
    "the amplitude envelopes of the limit cycle solutions are omitted from ( b ) and ( c ) .    in the remainder of this paper",

    "the `` new '' unstable branch develops a hopf bifurcation at the turning point .",

    "the metamorphosis satisfies the conditions ( [ trans ] ) and is therefore an unusual , non - symmetric , transcritical bifurcation .",
    "it signals a profound change in the _ type _ of dynamics that the system is capable of . for @xmath31",
    "a transition must still occur at the lower limit point , but there is no classical hysteresis , ( c ) and ( d ) . in fact",
    "classical hysteresis is ( locally ) forbidden by the non - degeneracy condition @xmath32 in eqs [ trans ] .",
    "various scenarios are possible in this rgime , including a completely non - hysteretic transition , a forward transition to a stable steady state and a back transition from a large period limit cycle , or forward and back transitions occurring to and from a limit cycle .",
    "the symmetry - broken model comprises eqs [ e2a ] , [ e2b ] , and [ e4 ] , with [ e2d ] .",
    "the bifurcation structure , some of which is depicted in figs [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] , predicts various behaviours :    * shear flow suppression of turbulence ; * smooth , hysteretic , non - hysteretic , and oscillatory transitions ; * spontaneous and kicked reversals in direction of shear flow ; * saturation then decrease of the shear flow with power input due to pressure - dependent anomalous viscosity ; * a metamorphosis of the dynamics through a transcritical bifurcation .    a critical appraisal of experimental evidence that supports the qualitative structure of this model is given in ball ( 2004)ball:2004a . with the exception of the last item",
    "all of the above dynamics have been observed in magnetically contained fusion plasma systems .",
    "the model would therefore seem to be a `` good '' and `` complete '' one , in the sense of being free of pathological or persistent degenerate singularities and reflecting observed behaviours .    however , there are several outstanding issues that suggest the model is still incomplete .",
    "one issue arises as a gremlin in the bifurcation structure that makes an unphysical prediction , another comes from a thermal diffusivity term that was regarded as negligible in previous work on this model .",
    "a third issue arises from the two strands in literature on the physics of confinement transitions : the model as it stands does not describe confinement transitions due to a nonlinear electric field drive .",
    "the first issue of incompleteness concerns a pathology in the bifurcation structure of the model , implying infinite growth of shear flow as the power input _",

    "it would seem , therefore , that some important physics is still missing from the model .",

    "the pressure gradient jumps at s1 because the power input exceeds the distribution rates , and oscillatory dynamics between the energy subsystems sets in abruptly at s5 .",
    "the turbulence is enormously suppressed due to uptake of energy by the shear flow , but rises again dramatically with this hard onset of oscillations .",
    "the early theoretical work on confinement transitions attempted to explain edge l  h transitions exclusively in terms of the electric field driving torque created by nonambipolar ion orbit losses @xcite , with no coupling to the internal dynamics of energy transfers from the potential energy reservoir in the pressure gradient .",
    "the electric field is bistable , hence the transition to a high shear flow , or high confinement , rgime is discontinuous and hysteretic .",
    "although there are many supporting experiments @xcite , this exposition of the physics behind confinement transitions is incomplete because it can not explain shear flow suppression of turbulence  a well - known characteristic of l  h transitions .    here",
    "this `` electric field bifurcation '' physics is treated as a piece of a more holistic physical picture and a simple model for the rate of shear flow generation due to this physics is used to create a unified dynamical model for confinement transitions . following the earlier authors this rate",
    "is given as @xmath72 $ ] , which simply says that the rate at which ions are preferentially lost , and hence flow is generated , is proportional to a collision frequency @xmath73 times the fraction of those collisions that result in ions with sufficient energy to escape .",
    "the form of the energy factor assumes an ion distribution that is approximately maxwellian and @xmath74 , analogous to an activation energy , is proportional to the square of the critical escape velocity . in this form of the rate expression",
    "i have explicitly included the temperature - dependence of @xmath75 , through @xmath0 , which couples it to the rest of the system .",

    "overall , the effect of this contribution to shear flow generation from the ion orbit loss torque is to elongate and flatten the high shear flow peninsula .",
    "the hopf bifurcations that are starred in ( a ) , where the contribution is relatively small , have disappeared in ( b ) at a dze singularity .",
    "what this means is that as @xmath79 begins to take over * there is no longer a practicably accessible intermediate branch * , as can be seen in ( c ) where the intermediate branch is unstable until the remaining hopf bifurcation is encountered at extremely high @xmath4 .",
    "locally , in the transition region , as @xmath80 becomes significant the bifurcation diagram begins to look more like the simple s - shaped , cubic normal form schematics with classical hysteresis presented by earlier authors .",
    "however , this * unified * model accounts for shear flow suppression of the turbulence ( d ) , whereas theirs could not .",
    "the generation of stable shear flows in plasmas , and the associated confinement transitions and oscillatory behaviour in tokamaks and stellarators , is regulated by reynolds stress decorrelation of gradient - driven turbulence and/or by an induced bistable radial electric field .",
    "* these two mechanisms are smoothly unified by the first smooth road through the singularity and bifurcation structure of a reduced dynamical model for this system*.    the model is constructed self - consistently , beginning from simple rate - laws derived from the basic pathways for energy transfer from pressure gradient to shear flows .",
    "it is iteratively strengthened by finding the singularities and allowing them to `` speak for themselves '' , then matching up appropriate physics to the unfoldings of the singularities .",
    "the smooth road from turbulence driven to electric field driven shear flows crosses interesting territory :    * hysteresis is possible in both rgimes and is governed by different physics . * a metamorphosis of the dynamics is encountered , near which hysteretic transitions are forbidden .",
    "the metamorphosis is a robust organizing centre of codimension 1 , even though there are singularities of higher codimension in the system .",
    "* oscillatory and tristable domains are encountered . * to travel the smooth road several obstacles are successively negotiated in physically meaningful ways :",
    "a pitchfork is dissolved , simultaneously releasing a branch of solutions from a singular trap at infinity , a singularity is released from a trap at zero power input , and another is released from a trap at zero thermal diffusivity .    in particular , these results suggest strategies for controlling access to high confinement states and manipulating oscillatory behaviour in fusion experiments .",
    "more generally i have shown that low - dimensional models have a useful role to play in the study of one of the most formidable of complex systems , a strongly driven turbulent plasma .",
