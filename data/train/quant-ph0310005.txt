    "in schrdinger original paper @xcite , a bipartite entangled state of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the `` alive '' and `` dead '' states of a cat and @xmath3 two orthogonal states of a microscopic system , was suggested to illustrate the counterintuitive consequences of quantum mechanics in a macroscopic setting .",
    "more generally , in the literature , any single - system coherent superposition @xmath4 of two pure quantum states @xmath5 that are mesoscopically distinguishable , is often referred to as a _ schrdinger cat _ or a _ cat - like _ state .",
    "the interest in the study of such superpositions , possibly involving states of a microscopic system as well , stems from both theoretical and experimental considerations .",
    "actually , a cat state is one of the simplest and most fundamental configurations allowing to probe the archetypal aspects of quantum theory : the superposition principle and quantum entanglement .    as far as quantum optical systems are concerned , the possibility of realizing superposition states of the radiation field , first envisioned by yurke and stoler @xcite , has been extensively investigated in later years @xcite .",
    "however , pure state superpositions are in general corrupted by the interaction with the environment .",
    "therefore , cat - like states that are available for experiments are usually mixed states that suffered a partial decoherence , and it is crucial to know whether and to which extent superpositions can survive the environmental noise .",
    "the theme of decoherence of cat  like states spurred relevant theoretical works @xcite , especially aimed to select schemes of quantum control and feedback stabilizing coherent superpositions against decoherence @xcite .",
    "recent promising experimental results and perspectives continue to keep a widespread interest in this subject @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we study the non - unitary evolution of coherent and squeezed - coherent single - mode schrdinger cat - like states in generic gaussian noisy channels , namely , either thermal or squeezed - thermal baths of harmonic oscillators @xcite .",
    "in particular , we will focus our attention on the evolution of the purity ( or linear entropy ) of the states , showing how the quantum superposition is corrupted by the interaction with a noisy environment and how to optimize the state and channel parameters to minimize the decoherence rate .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [",
    "s : cat ] we introduce notations and evaluate the wigner function of generalized cat - like states . in section [ s : evo ] the time evolution in gaussian noisy channels is studied , whereas in section [ s : zoo ] the dependence of decoherence and purity on the parameters of the initial state and of the channel is discussed in detail . in section [",
    "s : opt ] optmized regimes to minimize decoherence are discussed and , finally , section [ s : out ] provides some concluding remarks .",
    "the simplest example of a schrdinger cat state of a single - mode radiation field is the following normalized superposition of coherent states @xmath6 we denote by @xmath7 the corresponding density matrix , whose symmetrically ordered characteristic function is given by @xmath8 & = & \\frac{1}{\\pi } \\int \\langle\\alpha|\\varrho_{\\alpha_{0},\\theta }    & = &   \\big(2 + 2\\cos(\\theta)\\;{\\rm e}^{-2|\\alpha_{0}|^{2}}\\big)^{-1 } \\,{\\rm e}^{-|\\eta|^{2}/2 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\big [ 2\\cosh ( \\alpha_{0}^{*}\\eta-\\alpha_{0}\\eta^ { * } ) + \\,{\\rm e}^{-2|\\alpha_{0}|^{2 } } 2\\cosh(\\alpha_{0}^{*}\\eta+\\alpha_{0}\\eta^{*}+i\\theta ) \\big]\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 denotes the displacement operator .",
    "the corresponding wigner function is defined as @xmath10 from now on , let us move to quadrature variables @xmath11 and @xmath12 , defined through @xmath13 . by defining @xmath14 one can write the wigner function @xmath15 as follows @xmath16 \\ ; . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first two gaussian terms are related to the projectors @xmath17 and @xmath18 : they are the wigner functions of the two coherent states @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the remaining two terms correspond to non diagonal operators and are responsible for the intereference effects which characterize a coherent superposition .",
    "we now move to the study of a `` squeezed cat '' , defined as the superposition of two squeezed coherent states .",
    "let us introduce the operator @xmath21 by means of a bogoliubov transformation @xmath22 and the states @xmath23 as its eigenvectors : @xmath24 .",
    "such states are known in the literature as ` two  photon coherent states ' and are indeed squeezed coherent states , according to the following well known relation @xcite @xmath25 with the requirements @xmath26 and the squeezing operator defined as @xmath27 .",
    "we consider the following superposition @xmath28 where the states @xmath29 are eigenstates of @xmath21 : such a state will be referred to as to a `` squeezed cat '' state .",
    "+ the wigner representation of the state @xmath29 can be easily found by recalling that a two  photon coherent state @xmath30 may as well be written as @xmath31 with the squeezing parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 determined by eqs .",
    "( [ sqpar ] ) .",
    "this means that one can promptly derive the wigner function @xmath34 of a squeezed cat state by simply replacing @xmath35 with @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ cocat ] ) and then applying a squeezing transformation . in the following",
    "we will set @xmath37 , without loss of generality , as a reference choice for phase space rotation .",
    "+ the squeezing transformation implemented by @xmath38 corresponds , in terms of the phase  space variables @xmath39 to the map @xmath40 applying such a transformation to the coherent cat wigner function eventually yields @xmath41 \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath42 of course , for @xmath43 and @xmath44 , one recovers eq .",
    "( [ cocat ] ) for a coherent cat .",
    "we now consider the evolution in time of an initial squeezed cat state put in a noisy channel , in presence of damping and/or pumping toward an asymptotic squeezed thermal state .",
    "the system is governed , in the interaction picture , by the following master equation @xcite @xmath45\\varrho + \\frac{\\gamma}{2}(n+1)\\:l[a]\\varrho - \\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\ : \\big ( m^{*}\\:d[a]\\varrho + m \\:d[a^{\\dag}]\\varrho \\big ) \\label{rhoev } \\ , , \\ ] ] where the dot stands for time ",

    "it is in general a complex number @xmath49 , while @xmath50 is a phenomenological parameter related to the purity of the asymptotic state .",
    "positivity of the density matrix imposes the constraint @xmath51 . at thermal equilibrium ,",
    "_ i.e. _  for @xmath52 , @xmath50 coincides with the average number of thermal photons in the bath .    as is well known , eq .",
    "( [ rhoev ] ) can be trasnsformed into a linear fokker ",
    "planck equation for the wigner function of the system @xcite .",
    "moreover , the gaussian solutions of such equation have been thoroughly analysed in previous works @xcite .",
    "the initial condition we consider here is described by the wigner function @xmath34 of eq .",
    "( [ sqcat ] ) , which is just a linear combination of gaussian terms .",
    "therefore , its evolution in the noisy channel can be followed straightforwardly by exploiting the general results derived in ref .",
    "@xcite : each gaussian term evolves independently and it suffices to follow the time dependence of its first and second statistical moments .",
    "let @xmath53 and @xmath54 be , respectively , the covariance matrix and the vector of the first moments of a gaussian state ( @xmath55 being the quadrature phase operators ) .",
    "then , the time  evolution of @xmath56 and @xmath57 in the squeezed thermal channel is described by the following eqs .",
    "@xcite @xmath58 the time - dependent solution for the wigner function @xmath59 of an initial squeezed cat is thus readily found and reads @xmath60 \\ ; , \\label{wigner}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath56 given by eqs .",
    "( [ sigma ] , [ sigmainf ] ) .",
    "the first moments of each gaussian term are exponentially damped in the channel .",
    "any initial cat state is attracted toward an asymptotic centered squeezed thermal state with wigner function @xmath61 this state , like all asymptotic quantities , is a property of the channel and does not depend on the initial state .",
    "in order to quantify decoherence of the state caused by environmental noise , we consider the loss of purity .",
    "the degree of purity of a continuous variable quantum state @xmath62 can be effectively characterized either by its von neumann entropy @xmath63 or by its linear entropy @xmath64 @xmath65 in the following we will adopt linear entropy , which can be conveniently evaluated . the quantity @xmath66 , conjugate to @xmath64 , will be referred to as the ` purity ' from now on .    for an initial pure cat state ( @xmath67 ) at time @xmath68 , the asymptotic value @xmath69 can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ asy ] ) by straightforward integration @xcite @xmath70 at finite times the purity of a decohering cat can be determined integrating the function @xmath71 given by eq .",
    "( [ wigner ] ) , according to eq .",
    "( [ purea ] ) .",
    "the integration can be promptly performed with the help of the following thumb rule @xmath72 @xmath73 exploiting the above rule one eventually has @xmath74 \\ , , \\label{purezza}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath75 and @xmath76 eq .",
    "( [ purezza ] ) shows that @xmath77 is a decreasing function of the initial parameters @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "this should be expected : the ` bigger ' the cat is , the faster it decoheres . for @xmath80 the superposition disappears and the cat state reduces to a centered squeezed state ; the latter , whose evolution in noisy channels has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , decoheres more slowly than the corresponding cat state .",
    "the numerical analysis shows that the phase @xmath81 has little effect on the behaviour of purity at large times : in fact , as it is evident from eq .",
    "( [ purezza ] ) , all the terms involving @xmath81 are suppressed by gaussian terms of the form @xmath82 . in fig .",
    "[ f : cats ] the behaviour of purity over the full temporal range up to the asymptotic regime is showed for various choices of the parameters of the channel and of the initial state .",
    "one feature which is most evident in all instances is the fast initial fall of the purity .",
    "although the minimum value of the purity attained in such a steep descent can vary , the temporal scale in which the minimum is reached is always of the order of @xmath83 , which is indeed the only time characterizing the losses in the channel . besides",
    ", it can be seen that the general behaviour of purity in squeezed baths is quite the same as in non squeezed ones .",
    "one can see as well that the value of the first minimum of the purity depends drastically on the squeezing parameter @xmath32 , decreasing with greater @xmath32 , while , for a given squeezing parameter , an increase in the parameters @xmath78 and @xmath79 delays the reaching of the asymptotic purity ( see fig .",
    "[ f : cats ] ) .",
    "optimal regimes with minimized decoherence can be determined by maximizing the purity at any given time for fixed values of the parameters of the channel and of the initial state .",
    "notice that , as we have shown in the previous section , a cat  like state decoheres on a time scale of the order of the photon lifetime @xmath83 , regardless of the choice of the parameters of both the gaussian reservoir and the initial pure cat state .",
    "this fact is a manifestation of a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics : once a single photon is added or lost , all the information contained in a coherent superposition ` leaks out to the environment ' and is therefore lost as well , together with the possibility of detecting such a coherent behaviour by means of interferometry @xcite .",
    "a simple , meaningful example in this respect is just a coherent even cat @xmath84 subjected to damping . under the loss of a photon , such a state jumps into @xmath85 , which is an odd cat and has got opposite interference terms .",
    "therefore , as soon as the probability of losing a photon reaches @xmath86 , the original superposition turns into an incoherent mixture of an even and an odd cat , whose interference terms cancel out each other exactly @xcite",
    ".    actually , a more detailed analysis would reveal that decoherence times are even shorter than @xmath83 : for a coherent cat @xmath87 evolving in a thermal environment , coherence is lost at @xmath88 @xcite . in view of these considerations , we are interested in maximizing the purity in the time region @xmath89 .",
    "a relevant question in such a context is : given an initial bath and an initial squeezing of the cat  like state , which is the optimal phase space direction of @xmath90 at fixed @xmath91 ?",
    "note that the last condition can be seen as a constraint on the energy of the cat  like state .",
    "obviously , for a non squeezed cat in a thermal channel the symmetry of the problem forbids the existence of a privileged direction .",
    "interesting issues come instead from the consideration of a squeezed cat in a thermal channel and a non squeezed cat in a squeezed bath . for the moment being , let us consider the instance of an ` even ' cat , _",
    "i.e. _  of a cat with coherent phase @xmath92 .",
    "the dependence of the purity on @xmath36 is essentially contained in exponentials of quadratic forms , see eq .",
    "( [ purezza ] ) .",
    "the algebraic analysis of such terms in the case of a squeezed cat in thermal baths and of a coherent cat in squeezed baths is quite easy ( see app .",
    "[ app ] ) . if the squeezing is performed on the inital cat state , the coherence is better preserved if @xmath36 is chosen in the same phase space direction of the variance which is suppressed by squeezing . with our notation , this corresponds to @xmath93 ( where @xmath33 is the squeezing angle ) . on the contrary , if the squeezing is performed on the bath in the direction @xmath94 , the choice @xmath95 turns out to be the best one to slow down the rate of decoherence .",
    "this somehow counterintuitive situation is due to the existence of complex fringe patterns of a cat state in phase space , especially in the presence of squeezing .",
    "actually , preserving quantum coherence is crucially related to the persistance of the interference fringes : reducing quantum fluctuations in a phase space direction protects the fringes from degradation and the cat state from decoherence . with the above expedient choices of the phase @xmath96 ,",
    "squeezing does actually improves the coherence of the superposition at small times with respect to dissipation in a phase insensitive setting @xcite .    now , let us suppose that for an even cat state the phase @xmath96 is optimally chosen and let us consider a channel with asymptotic purity @xmath69 .",
    "it can be easily shown ( cfr .",
    "[ app ] ) that the purity of an initially squeezed cat ( with squeezing @xmath97 ) in such a thermal channel equals , at any given time , the one of a non squeezed cat evolving in a squeezed channel with the same squeezing @xmath97 .",
    "the same protection against decoherence provided by the squeezing of the bath can be obtained , in a thermal phase insensitive channel , by squeezing the initial even cat state of the same amount in an orthogonal direction .",
    "we finally remark that , with an optimal phase setting , an optimal finite value of the squeezing parameter @xmath97 does indeed exist ( see fig .  [ smtim ] ) .",
    "this fact can be best appreciated from eq .",
    "( [ purezza ] ) : even if the exponential terms increase with increasing @xmath97 , the factor @xmath98 decreases with @xmath97 .",
    "the value of @xmath97 allowing the maximum slowing down of decoherence increases with increasing @xmath91 .",
    "we now briefly consider the instance @xmath99 , which is the one considered originally by yurke and stoler as being produced by a unitary evolution in kerr media . in such a case , the last term in eq .",
    "( [ purezza ] ) vanishes , so that the optimal choice for @xmath96 can be easily found for any choice of @xmath32 , @xmath100 and @xmath94 . to this end , it is sufficient to determine the eigenvector corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath101 , which coincides with the analogous eigenvector of @xmath102 and does not depend on time .",
    "however , we once again stress that , as soon as one deals with mesoscopic cat states ( so that @xmath103 ) , the dependence on the coherent phase @xmath81 is severely suppressed and all the considerations made for even cat states still hold , regardless of the choice of @xmath81 . results for the evolution of purity at small times are summarized in fig .",
    "[ smtim ] .",
    "the study of the decoherence of initial coherent and squeezed coherent cat states in arbitrary gaussian reservoirs has been carefully carried out by determining the exact time evolution of the purity of the state .",
    "optimal settings that minimize the rate of decoherence in relevant configurations have been determined .",
    "in particular , we have shown that the same protection against decoherence granted by a squeezed bath can be achieved by squeezing the initial cat  like state . in view of the well known difficulties involved in the experimental realization of squeezed baths , even as effective descriptions of feedback schemes @xcite",
    ", this equivalence could provide a relevant alternative option for experimental purposes @xcite .",

    "in this appendix we analytically single out the optimal phase space orientations of the cat state for the configurations discussed in section  [ s : opt ] .",
    "the orientation of the cat state is determined by the angle @xmath104 . in the following",
    "we will set @xmath92 and define , for ease of notation , @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "the squeezing parameter @xmath100 of the bath is determined by @xmath107 @xcite .",

    "( [ purezza ] ) take the same values for a squeezed cat in a thermal channel and a non squeezed cat in a squeezed channel .",
