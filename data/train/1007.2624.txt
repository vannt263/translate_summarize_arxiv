    "parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) determined from global analysis  @xcite of fixed - target and collider data , mainly from deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) , are an essential input to theory calculations for hard processes at hadron colliders such as the tevatron and lhc .",
    "in addition to the fitted input pdfs , several other parameters enter into the global fits , which affect both the pdfs obtained and predictions for hadronic processes .",
    "one important example is the value of the strong coupling @xmath4 and its uncertainty  @xcite .",
    "others , which are the focus of the present paper , are the values of the heavy - quark masses and the scheme used to calculate heavy - quark contributions to observables .",
    "in particular , while the precise values taken for @xmath0 and @xmath1 may not be crucial for the processes included in the global pdf analyses , calculations of processes with explicit @xmath12- and @xmath6-quarks might be more sensitive to these values , and it is therefore desirable to have pdfs available which have been consistently fitted and evolved with corresponding values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we will study two topics , both of which concern the treatment of the heavy charm and bottom quarks in global parton analyses .",
    "the first topic , which is the subject of section  [ sec : massdep ] , concerns the sensitivity of the mstw  2008 global parton analysis  @xcite to the values of the heavy - quark masses @xmath13 , with @xmath14 . in ref .",
    "@xcite these masses were taken to be @xmath15  gev and @xmath16  gev .",
    "here we perform global fits for a range of @xmath0 and @xmath1 about these values , with @xmath17 allowed to be a free parameter . in this way",
    ", we determine the values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 preferred by the data , and the correlations between these values of @xmath13 and @xmath17 .",
    "due to a significant correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath17 , we also perform fits with varying @xmath0 but with @xmath17 held fixed .",
    "we study how the cross sections for @xmath2 , @xmath3 and higgs boson production at the tevatron and the lhc depend on the choice of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and we provide a recommendation on how to include the uncertainty arising from @xmath13 in a general cross - section calculation .",
    "the second topic , described in section  [ sec : ffns ] , is the generation of sets of 3- and 4-flavour pdfs corresponding to the mstw  2008  @xcite 5-flavour sets of pdfs .",
    "we follow the same procedure previously used to generate the 3- and 4-flavour versions  @xcite of the 5-flavour mrst 2004 pdfs  @xcite , i.e.  the input pdfs ( and @xmath4 ) at @xmath18  gev@xmath19 determined from fits in the 5-flavour scheme are used as the initial condition for 3- or 4-flavour evolution . however , going beyond ref .",
    ", we also provide 3- and 4-flavour _ eigenvector _ pdf sets to enable calculation of pdf uncertainties , and we provide 3- and 4-flavour pdf sets for a wide range of @xmath0 and @xmath1 values , respectively . as an example of the use of the central 4-flavour pdfs for the default quark masses , we compare the total cross sections for @xmath3 production at the tevatron and lhc in the 4- and 5-flavour schemes . however , first we begin with a short rsum of the alternative `` schemes '' to treat heavy flavours , and in particular , an explanation of what precisely we mean by 3- , 4- , and 5-flavour pdfs .",
    "it is appropriate to briefly recall the various schemes for the treatment of heavy flavours in global parton analyses . in pdf analyses it is common to start evolving upwards from @xmath20  gev@xmath19 with the distributions of the three light quarks @xmath21 , assuming that they are massless .",
    "as we evolve upwards , we have the choice to turn on the heavy - quark @xmath22 distributions as we pass through their respective transition point , for which a convenient choice is @xmath23 .",
    "as we pass through a transition point , the number of active quarks is increased from @xmath24 to @xmath25 , and the parton densities are related to each other perturbatively , i.e. @xmath26 where the perturbative matrix elements @xmath27 contain @xmath28 terms which are known to @xmath29  @xcite and @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "the `` @xmath31 '' arguments have been suppressed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : transition ] ) , and the symbol @xmath32 is shorthand for the convolution @xmath33 eq .",
    "( [ eq : transition ] ) relates the @xmath34 set of partons to the @xmath35 set , guaranteeing the correct evolution for both the @xmath24 and @xmath25 regimes .",
    "we make the simplest choice , @xmath36 , for the factorisation scale .",
    "hence , we have to decide whether or not to keep a heavy quark as just a final - state particle , and not as a parton within the proton",
    ". we may choose to keep just the three light flavours as parton distributions .",
    "we will call this the 3-flavour scheme ( 3fs ) , though it is often referred to as the fixed flavour number scheme ( ffns ) .",
    "alternatively , we may include the @xmath12-quark in the evolution above @xmath37 and generate 4-flavour pdfs in a 4-flavour scheme ( 4fs ) .",
    "actually , in the global mrst / mstw parton analyses we also include the @xmath6-quark distribution in the evolution above @xmath38 , but _ not _ the @xmath39-quark above @xmath40 , so we generate 5-flavour sets of parton distributions in a 5-flavour scheme ( 5fs ) .",
    "so to be precise , in our definition of @xmath41-flavour parton sets , @xmath41 refers to the _ maximum _ number of quark flavours in the evolution .    in each @xmath41-flavour scheme ( @xmath41fs )",
    "the structure functions are given by the usual convolution of coefficient functions and parton distributions : @xmath42 where the sum @xmath43 is over the gluon and the ( variable , depending on @xmath44 ) number of active quark flavours , @xmath45 .",
    "we have a choice in how to choose @xmath41 and define the coefficient functions .",
    "one simple choice is to fix @xmath46 . for the heavy flavours",
    ", all the @xmath13 dependence then occurs in the coefficient functions , and these are called the ffns coefficient functions .",
    "the structure functions may be written in the form @xmath47 however , the sum of the @xmath48 terms , with @xmath49 , is not included in the perturbative expansion .",
    "thus the accuracy of the expansion becomes increasingly unreliable as @xmath44 increases above @xmath50 .",
    "in addition , there is the problem that the full mass dependence of the coefficient functions is known up to nlo  @xcite , but is not completely defined at nnlo , i.e.  the @xmath51 coefficient , @xmath52 , for @xmath53 is not fully known , see  ref .",
    "( here , the outer subscript `` @xmath54 '' denotes the @xmath55 contribution to the heavy - flavour structure function @xmath56 . )    as an aside , we note that it would be possible to treat the charm quark as light , and the bottom quark as heavy",
    ". then it would be possible to express the structure functions and cross sections in terms of four light quarks with all the mass dependence of the bottom quark contained in the coefficient functions .",
    "this is sometimes called the 4-flavour ffns .",
    "however if one needs to use scales @xmath57 and in the vicinity of @xmath58 , as for example in the global pdf analysis , then the charm - quark mass dependence , and the charm transition point ( if @xmath59 ) , should be included .",
    "thus , this 4-flavour ffns is only applicable in a restricted range of @xmath44 , and it will not be considered further here .    the alternative , and better , approach is to use the 4-flavour ( and 5-flavour ) pdfs of the variable flavour number schemes ( 4fs , 5fs ) .",
    "the simplest variable flavour number evolution procedure is to evolve treating some ( or all ) of the heavy quarks as massless , but to turn on the distributions at the appropriate transition points , @xmath60 .",
    "that is , to assume that these heavy - quark distributions evolve according to the splitting functions for massless quarks .",
    "thus , the resummation of the large logarithms in @xmath61 is achieved by the introduction of heavy - flavour parton distributions and the solution of the evolution equations .",
    "it is motivated by the observation that at high scales the massive quarks behave like massless partons , and the coefficient functions are simply those in the massless limit , e.g.  for structure functions @xmath62 where , as in eq .",
    ", the sum @xmath43 is over the gluon and the ( variable ) number @xmath45 of quarks that are active during the evolution .",
    "this is the so - called zero - mass variable flavour number scheme ( zm - vfns ) .",
    "however , the zm - vfns has the failing that it simply ignores @xmath63 corrections to the coefficient functions , and hence it is inaccurate in the region where @xmath44 is not so much greater than @xmath50 .",
    "thus , strictly speaking , the zm - vfns does not define a scheme , but rather an approximation .",
    "so we have two approaches where the treatment of heavy flavours is relatively simple .",
    "the 3-flavour scheme ( or ffns ) , appropriate to the region @xmath64 , and the zm - vfns , appropriate to the region @xmath65 .",
    "clearly , for precision parton analyses , we must use a so - called general - mass variable flavour number scheme ( gm - vfns ) which smoothly connects these two well - defined regions , so as to reduce to the ( 3-flavour ) ffns in the low @xmath44 limit and to the zm - vfns in the high @xmath44 limit ( up to possible terms of higher order in @xmath4 ) . in particular , in eq .",
    "( [ general ] ) the value of @xmath24 increases by one each time we reach @xmath60 in the evolution , and the coefficient functions @xmath66 interpolate smoothly from @xmath67 to @xmath68 , for the maximum value of @xmath69 .",
    "there is some freedom in how one does this , and in the mstw  2008 analysis  @xcite we use the definition of the gm - vfns as described in ref .",
    "ffns coefficient functions which are not fully calculated . in the gm - vfns",
    "we only need these in the low-@xmath44 regime and we approximate them using the known results of the small-@xmath31  @xcite and threshold limits  @xcite ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for recent refinements ) .",
    "] we also note that actually a 5-flavour gm - vfns is used , since we do not include the top quark in the evolution .",
    "note that this means that processes such as associated production of higgs bosons with top quarks should be calculated using the 5-flavour pdfs with the full @xmath70 subprocess matrix elements , i.e.  @xmath71 . in a 6fs",
    ", one would calculate this via @xmath72 , introducing a top - quark pdf .",
    "although in principle this method would include resummed higher - order corrections @xmath73^n$ ] , we would expect that for all practical purposes  tev , @xmath74 .",
    "] at the lhc , the 5fs approach , @xmath71 , supplemented by nlo corrections , would be adequate , see also section  [ sec : ztot4fs ] .    as just noted , the use of a gm - vfns is nowadays essential for the determination of a set of precision pdfs from the data . of the total , so inaccuracies induced by using the zm - vfns are in practice irrelevant . ) ] however , there are processes where the full mass dependence of the coefficient functions for @xmath12 and @xmath6 production processes are only known in the case where the heavy quark is treated as a final - state particle , and not as a parton in the proton . for example , ffns parton distributions are needed for use with the hvqdis  @xcite and mc@nlo  @xcite programs .",
    "thus in this paper we make available 3- and 4-flavour pdfs .",
    "we also give an example of their use .",
    "this is the subject of section  [ sec : ffns ] .",
    "in the mstw  2008 global parton analysis  @xcite we used @xmath15  gev and @xmath16  gev , where these are the pole mass values . some limited justification for choosing these values",
    "was briefly given at the end of section  3 of ref .",
    "to summarise , there was little data constraint on @xmath1 , so it was simply fixed at a value of @xmath75  gev , close to the calculated @xmath76 mass transformed to the pole mass .",
    "the fixed value of @xmath15  gev was close to the best - fit value at nlo if treated as a free parameter , but a little higher than the best - fit value at nnlo , and lower than the calculated @xmath76 mass transformed to the pole mass .",
    "we discuss limitations in constraints on the pole masses by transforming from the calculated @xmath76 masses below in section  [ sec : polemasses ] .    here , using _",
    "exactly _ the same data sets , we repeat the global analysis for different fixed values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , but with @xmath17 left as a free parameter .",
    "the mstw 2008 global fit  @xcite used a wide variety of data from both fixed - target experiments and the hera @xmath77 and tevatron @xmath78 colliders .",
    "neutral - current structure functions ( @xmath53 and @xmath79 ) were included from fixed - target lepton ",
    "nucleon scattering experiments ( bcdms  @xcite , nmc  @xcite , e665  @xcite and slac  @xcite ) , low - mass drell  yan cross sections from the e866/nusea experiment  @xcite , and charged - current structure functions ( @xmath53 and @xmath80 ) and dimuon cross sections from neutrino  nucleon scattering experiments ( ccfr / nutev  @xcite and chorus  @xcite ) . from the hera experiments , h1 and zeus , data were included on neutral- and charged - current reduced cross sections ( @xmath81 and @xmath82 )  @xcite , the charm structure function ( @xmath83 )  @xcite , and inclusive jet production in dis  @xcite . from the tevatron experiments , cdf and d ,",
    "run ii data were included on inclusive jet production  @xcite , the lepton charge asymmetry from @xmath2 decays  @xcite and the @xmath3 rapidity distribution  @xcite .",
    "a more detailed description of the treatment of each of these data sets can be found in ref .",
    "note that more precise h1 and zeus data on @xmath83 ( and the beauty structure function , @xmath84 , not included originally ) are now available , but we stick to fitting exactly the same data sets as in the mstw 2008 analysis .",
    "the sensitivity to the charm mass of the data in the global pdf analysis , and the subset of @xmath83 data , in terms of the goodness - of - fit measure @xmath85 , is shown in table  [ tab : mc ] at nlo and nnlo .",
    "the global best - fit values of @xmath0 , found by varying @xmath0 in steps of 0.01 gev , are @xmath86 gev at nlo and @xmath87 gev at nnlo . recall that in section  3 of ref .",
    "@xcite we instead quoted best - fit values of @xmath88  gev at nlo and @xmath89  gev at nnlo .",
    "in fact , the more detailed analysis performed here , by scanning @xmath0 in steps of 0.01 gev , revealed a rather flat minimum of the global @xmath85 versus @xmath0 , with a slight double - minimum structure at nlo ( the two minima being at 1.39  gev and 1.45  gev ) .",

    "unlike @xmath117 , the pole mass @xmath0 is , in principle , a physically - defined ( spoilt by confinement which gives power corrections , see below ) quantity which is stable to the order of perturbation theory .",

    "fig : globalmc ] that the values are only marginally compatible .",
    "this is due to a variety of reasons .",
    "the perturbative expansion of heavy - flavour coefficient functions is not as convergent as one might hope , with large corrections near threshold and in the small-@xmath31 limit .",
    "so even though the pole mass might , in principle , be the same quantity at two different perturbative orders , the calculation at lower orders is missing significant corrections at higher orders which will affect the value of the pole mass obtained in an extraction from data .",
    "perhaps most important in this respect is the large negative boundary condition ( at @xmath60 ) for the heavy - flavour distribution at nnlo , which has the effect of flattening the slope @xmath118 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) and implies a lower mass to correct for this .",
    "there is also more potential variation in the gm - vfns definition at nlo than nnlo , and there would be slightly more stability in preferred pole mass in , for example , the `` optimal '' scheme introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite ( although this does not remove the variation and is the subject for a future study ) . finally , as briefly noted above and discussed further below , the definition of the pole mass is contaminated by non - perturbative corrections .",
    "these are reflected in the divergence of the perturbation theory and power corrections are , in practice , difficult to disentangle from higher - order corrections , so extractions at different orders will have a variation from this source .",
    "we now examine this issue in more detail .",
    "let us consider the values we extract and use as default . in the _ review of particle physics _",
    "@xcite , the authors quote values for the `` _ running _ '' masses , @xmath119 and @xmath120 , in the @xmath76 scheme : @xmath121 which they evaluate from a whole series of independent determinations .",
    "this implies a precise determination of masses .",

    "using our nnlo value of @xmath4 , the term - by - term conversion factor ( obtained from the formula in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , starting at zeroth order and going to the highest known order of @xmath51  @xcite , for the bottom - quark mass is @xmath122 and for charm is @xmath123 . would make little difference . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , nnnlo extractions of @xmath17 are very similar to the corresponding nnlo values , and the slightly quicker running at nnnlo would marginally increase @xmath4 at the scale of the charm- and bottom - quark masses , i.e.  the convergence of the perturbative series would likely be very slightly worse . ]",
    "the former implies that convergence is ceasing , while the latter has no real convergence at all , since it relies on a much higher value of @xmath4 ( and larger coefficients due to less cancellation between individual terms as the number of light quark flavours decreases  @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the contamination by renormalons of the perturbative series for the transformation of a running quark mass in the @xmath76 scheme to the pole mass has been known for a long time  @xcite .",
    "these papers estimate the intrinsic ambiguity of the perturbative series due to infrared contributions , translating into an uncertainty on the pole mass of at least @xmath124 , but more likely of order 0.10.2  gev .",
    "the best estimate one can obtain from the perturbative series is usually defined by including all terms in the series until they cease to fall in magnitude from one order to the next . for the bottom quark , under the plausible assumption that the unknown @xmath125 term is similar in size to the calculated @xmath126 term , this would give a pole mass of @xmath127  gev .",
    "the uncertainty on this value from the conversion is either the estimate from ref .",
    "@xcite or roughly the size of the last term included in the series , i.e.  @xmath128  gev .",
    "the good correspondence of the two estimates of the uncertainty is expected , and suggests that the series is indeed truncated at the correct point . if this uncertainty is added ( approximately ) in quadrature with the uncertainty on the @xmath76 scheme mass , eq .  , we obtain @xmath129  gev .",
    "the determination of the charm - quark pole mass by conversion from the @xmath76 scheme mass is more problematic since , as noted above , the perturbative series displays no clear convergence at all .",
    "however , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the leading renormalon contribution is the same for different masses , i.e.  @xmath130 , independent of quark flavour .",
    "this means the difference between @xmath1 and @xmath0 can be well determined , and turns out to be @xmath131  gev with a very small uncertainty  @xcite . using this result",
    "we obtain a best determination of the charm - quark pole mass of @xmath132  gev .",
    "there is an uncertainty on @xmath133 due to the fact that the non - dominant renormalon contributions , @xmath134 and beyond , do not cancel .",
    "however , the uncertainty on @xmath133 is small compared to the @xmath135  gev uncertainty on @xmath1 and hence does not affect the uncertainty on @xmath0 at the quoted accuracy when added in quadrature .    these pole mass values obtained from @xmath76 conversion : @xmath136 are slightly high compared with our default values ( @xmath137  gev and @xmath75  gev ) and our best - fit values of @xmath0 , particularly at nnlo , but even in the most discrepant case the error bars overlap .",
    "combining our best - fit @xmath0 values and the pole mass determination given in eq .  , it seems that a range for @xmath0 of about 1.251.55  gev at 68% c.l .  and 1.151.65  gev at 90%  c.l .",
    "would seem reasonable at present . with improved hera data on @xmath83 to come  @xcite this range can hopefully be narrowed in the near future .",
    "turning now to the bottom mass , the limited information that we obtain from comparison to data , and from the determination of the pole mass given in eq .",
    ", suggest that a range of @xmath1 from about 4.655.05  gev at 68%  c.l .  would seem sensible . as we will see in the next section , lhc cross sections that do not involve explicit @xmath6-quarks are not very sensitive to the pdf variation with @xmath1 ,",
    "so using our grids at 4.5 and 5  gev should give a good estimate of the uncertainty due to @xmath1 at 68%  c.l .",
    ", and the grids at 4.25 and 5.25  gev should give a conservative estimate of this source of uncertainty at 90%  c.l . as with charm , improved hera data on @xmath84 are likely to limit the allowed spread in future .",
    "if we reach the stage where we become confident that the data are starting to constrain the pole masses to an accuracy clearly better than the renormalon ambiguity , it may become preferable to transform to a scheme where @xmath76 definitions are used instead , even though the mass is less directly related to a physical variable in this case",
    ". this would be appropriate if we become strongly constrained by data with @xmath138 and data close to the kinematic threshold , @xmath139 ( for neutral - current dis ) , where non - perturbative effects and the interplay between the leading - twist power - series and the power corrections become very important , and the ambiguities may be reduced in a different renormalisation scheme .",

    "hadron processes we would expect the difference to be about @xmath194 , exactly as observed . at nlo for structure functions at this",
    "@xmath31 the ratio is reduced to @xmath195 , so inclusion of the extra @xmath196 removes much of the discrepancy present at lo . however , for hadron ",
    "hadron processes , nlo in the fixed flavour scheme only contains the extra large logarithm for one of the two incoming partons , so the ratio between the 5fs and 4fs would be roughly @xmath197 , again as we expect to see in practice",
    ". it would only be at nnlo in the 4fs , when the double logarithm for both incoming pdfs is included , that we would expect to see the reduction to roughly @xmath198 in the ratio of the 5fs to 4fs cross sections .",
    "this is a general feature , i.e.  the 4fs ( or 3fs ) will converge to the resummed 5fs results more slowly for hadronic processes than for those in dis .    in summary ,",
    "the 5fs pdfs are clearly the most appropriate to use for inclusive quantities such as @xmath199 ( or @xmath200 , etc . ) at high @xmath44 scales , where resummation of the @xmath201^n$ ] contributions is evidently important . however , for more exclusive quantities like @xmath202 , where the @xmath6 quarks are measured in the final state , the 4fs parton distributions are more appropriate since the 5fs calculation gives no information on the spectator @xmath6 and @xmath156 quarks which must be present in the final state for the @xmath6- and @xmath203-initiated processes .",
    "note that if only the _ total _ cross section is required , without cuts imposed on the @xmath6-quarks , then a 5fs is still better , e.g.  for @xmath7 a 5fs calculation can be used for @xmath182 at nnlo , where the @xmath6-quarks couple directly to the @xmath3 , and so there are implicitly also two @xmath6-quarks in the final state  @xcite .",

    "was considered in both the 4fs ( @xmath205 etc . ) and 5fs ( @xmath206 etc . ) to nlo in pqcd , using the appropriate mrst 2004 pdf sets  @xcite .",
    "the central predictions in the 5fs were shown to be approximately 40@xmath162 larger than those in the 4fs . even taking the scale uncertainty into account the 4fs and 5fs nlo cross sections",

    "this matching has , of course , been done for structure functions in dis using different variants of the gm - vfns , but applications to hadron collider cross sections are more involved and have so far been limited ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an application of the gm - vfns to the @xmath208 spectrum in heavy - flavour hadroproduction ) . however , for processes where the hard scale is , for example , @xmath209 , then the gm - vfns calculation will differ from the zm - vfns ( 5fs ) only by terms @xmath210 .",
    "we would therefore expect the complete gm - vfns calculation to give results very close to the pure zm - vfns ( 5fs ) for the total cross section .",
    "note that rather than producing separate 4-flavour pdfs for use in a 4fs calculation , an alternative approach ( e.g.  used at nlo in refs .",
    "@xcite ) is to use the conventional 5-flavour pdfs , then pass to the 4-flavour scheme using counterterms given in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , these counterterms  @xcite are equivalent to using the inverse of transition matrix elements , but only out to order @xmath4 .",
    "one could indeed use the transition matrix elements themselves to go from 4-flavour to 5-flavour pdfs , except this would not sum the logarithmic terms , @xmath201^n$ ] , in the pdf evolution .",
