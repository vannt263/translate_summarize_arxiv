    "approaches to resolving the late - time acceleration of the universe may be divided into three broad classes ( see , for example ,  @xcite for a brief review ) .",
    "perhaps the simplest possibility is that there is some , as yet undiscovered , consequence of our existing model of gravity and matter that leads to acceleration during the current epoch . included in this category",
    "is the existence of a tiny cosmological constant and the possibility that the backreaction of cosmological perturbations might cause self - acceleration .",
    "a second option is the idea that a new dynamical component exists in cosmic energy budget .",
    "included here are sources of energy density modeled by a scalar field , usually referred to as _",
    "dark energy_. of equal interest , however , is that general relativity ( gr ) can be modified in the low curvature regime , to admit self - accelerating solutions in the presence of negligible matter  @xcite .",
    "we consider , in this paper , the class of modified gravity models in which the gravitational action contains a general function @xmath0 of the ricci scalar .",
    "for such models , the analysis of the background cosmological evolution can be significantly simplified by performing a conformal transformation on the metric .",
    "such a transformation maps from a frame in which the gravitational action and resulting field equations are modified from gr , commonly called the jordan frame , to a frame in which the gravitational action for the new metric is the einstein - hilbert one , commonly called the einstein frame . in this new frame ,",
    "the matter fields couple non - minimally to the new metric ( matter no longer falls along geodesics of the new metric ) and an extra degree of freedom now manifests as a new scalar field .",
    "these couplings affect the evolution of perturbations in a potentially observable way  @xcite .",
    "this paper focuses on structure formation in general @xmath0 theories and comparison of the predictions with observations .",
    "this complements previous work investigating the background evolution @xcite and solar system implications @xcite for @xmath0 modifications . as part of this analysis",
    "we derive the linear cosmological perturbation theory for a general form of @xmath0 considering only scalar perturbations , since the tensor and vector modes are unaffected by @xmath0 modifications to gravity .",
    "we present our equations without fixing a gauge , as well as in two explicit coordinate choices : the conformal newtonian and synchronous gauges .",
    "these equations are presented in a comprehensive and practical form that can be directly compared to standard perturbation analyses ( e.g.  @xcite ) and are applicable to the modification of existing cosmological codes such as camb  @xcite .",
    "this work complements alternative formulations in the palatini approach  @xcite , for the metric approach in the einstein frame  @xcite and , more recently , in terms of  frame - independent \" variables  @xcite .",
    "in section  [ fofrdescription ] we give an overview of the @xmath0 action and in section  [ conformal ] discuss the conformal transformation used to express @xmath0 theories in a frame with einstein field equations with non - minimally coupled matter . in sections [ perttheory ] and [ evol ] we present the main analytical results of the paper . in section  [ perttheory ] we present full perturbation equations for @xmath0 theories in the jordan frame . in section  [ evol ] we examine the general behavior of late time structure formation in both einstein and jordan frames specifically for @xmath0 theories that allow late - time cosmological acceleration solutions .",

    "a prime denotes differentiation with respect to conformal time , @xmath18 , @xmath20 is the equivalent hubble expansion rate .    in the jordan frame ,",
    "the metric is that of standard gr minimally coupled to matter .",
    "hence the stress tensor and its conservation laws will remain the ones of standard gr .",
    "the continuity equation is the usual +3(+p ) & = & 0  .",

    "although the background cosmological behavior can be chosen by an appropriate choice of @xmath0 , this freedom comes at the expense of unfamiliar dynamical equations .",
    "there exists , however , a complementary , and sometimes conceptually simpler , way in which to approach @xmath0 modifications to gr .",
    "it is possible to perform a conformal transformation on the metric so as to render the gravitational action in the usual einstein hilbert form of gr .",
    "the price one pays for this simplification is a non - minimal coupling between matter fields and the new metric @xcite , as well as the appearance of a new scalar degree of freedom evolving under a potential determined precisely by the original form of the @xmath0 coupling in the jordan action .    using the approaches of chiba  @xcite and of magnano & sokolowski  @xcite ,",
