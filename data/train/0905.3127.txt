    "one of the most fascinating areas of ultra - cold atomic physics is the experimental investigation of the dynamical properties of interacting many - body systems .",
    "the control of experimental parameters and ability to tailor systems is allowing many interesting effects to be observed which would have been almost impossible in the recent past . among important examples",
    "are the recently observed dynamical instabilities  @xcite and inhibited transport  @xcite in one dimensional ( 1d ) and three - dimensional ( 3d ) optical lattice systems , as well as nonlinear self - trapping in 1d periodic potentials  @xcite and in josephson junctions  @xcite . despite these important experimental advances ,",
    "the theoretical description of dynamical properties , especially for strong interactions , remains a major challenge , with progress having been incremental up to now . for bosons , except for rare cases where the dynamics are analytically tractable , e.g. by bethe ansatz  @xcite",
    ", one method is to adapt the phase - space representations of quantum optics  @xcite .",
    "attempts have been made , for example , to apply the positive - p representation to the dynamics of trapped and colliding bose - einstein condensates  @xcite , although these have been only partially successful due to numerical instabilities which mean that integration is restricted to either short times or small interaction strengths .",
    "we note here that efforts are being made to extend the usefulness of this method  @xcite , with promising results for single - mode systems . for 1d systems numerical algorithms based on adaptive matrix - product decompositions of the state vector , such as the t - dmrg  @xcite and the related tebd algorithm  @xcite , have recently been developed .",
    "they too are restricted however to short times or systems with slow entanglement growth .    for highly nonlinear underdamped systems such as trapped condensates ,",
    "it is often easier to use the truncated wigner approximation ( -w )  @xcite , with the main advantage being that it is numerically stable  @xcite and simple to implement .",
    "the w takes into account initial uncertainty between conjugate variables or initial quantum noise  @xcite , which is often necessary to trigger certain dynamical processes .",
    "this method was recently used to predict and explain several experiments in the context of interacting cold atom systems . as an example , using this method the damping of a dipolar motion of a 1d condensate in an optical lattice was first predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite and later results were qualitatively confirmed in experiment  @xcite .",
    "this experiment was later simulated more accurately using a multi - band version of the w  @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite the w was used to analyze splitting or merging between elongated condensates , closely mimicking the situation realized in recent experiments  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the w enabled the authors to explain the coherence dynamics after a sudden quench of tunneling from an insulator to a superfluid , giving good agreement with experimental results  @xcite .",
    "for a fuller review of other recent developments , we direct the reader to ref .  @xcite .",
    "while the truncated wigner representation is becoming increasingly utilized , there are two drawbacks which prevent it from being the numerical technique of choice .",
    "the first is its approximate nature , arising from the truncation procedure , which may sometimes lead to demonstrably wrong results  @xcite . in principle",
    ", this drawback can be overcome .",
    "a way to fully map the quantum master equation onto wigner representation stochastic difference equations has been developed , but does not result in a widely and easily applicable method  @xcite .",
    "an expansion allowing one to include the dropped contribution perturbatively via quantum jumps was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , but until now this has been restricted to the calculation of single - time averages .",
    "the second drawback is that averages of the phase - space variables in the wigner representation do not map directly onto expectation values of _ time - normally ordered _ multitime operator products corresponding with experimental measurements . for two operators ,",
    "we recover a symmetrised product , while for three and more operators , there emerges a new type of ordering of heisenberg operators which we term _ time - symmetric _ @xcite . converting these to time - normal",
    "ordering requires the calculation of commutators of heisenberg operators at _",
    "different times_. at first glance this drawback appears to be fundamental , but we will demonstrate that it can be circumvented with surprising ease , by making use of the fact that commutators of heisenberg operators at different times express the _ response _ properties of a quantum system  @xcite .",
    "generally , commuting the heisenberg operators requires solving the full quantum stochastic nonlinear response problem , and , although possible in principle , this remains a formidable task @xcite . for two - time commutators , however , the process is simplified due to kubo s linear response formulation  @xcite , which has previously been used to convert normally - ordered correlations into symmetrically ordered ones within the positive - p representation  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show how , combined with the truncated wigner representation as a computational tool , kubo s linear response theory turns into a simple yet powerful approximate method of calculating two - time correlation functions of interacting bosonic fields with arbitrary operator ordering .",
    "we stress here that the kubo relation is exact , with the approximate nature coming from the truncation process used to find the appropriate stochastic equations .    in more traditional phase - space techniques ,",
    "the truncated - wigner equations are developed by dropping the third - order derivatives in the generalised fokker - planck equation for the single - time wigner distribution @xcite .",
    "the corresponding langevin equations are either non - stochastic ( without losses ) or probabilistic ( with losses ) and are very easy to handle numerically .",
    "however simple and straightforward , this conventional way of deriving the truncated wigner approach leaves it unclear if it can be applied to any _ multitime _ quantum averages . in our approach ,",
    "the truncated - wigner equations emerge as an approximation within rigorous phase - space path - integral techniques . by itself",
    ", the path integral expresses the averages of _ time - symmetrically - ordered products of heisenberg operators . _",
    "the generalisation associated with extending the truncated - wigner equations to multitime averages is thus highly nontrivial and requires a new concept : the time - symmetric ordering of the heisenberg operators .",
    "there does not seem to be a way of guessing this concept from within the conventional phase - space techniques . just proving the equivalence between the time - symmetric and the conventional symmetric ordering of free - field operators is a nontrivial task  @xcite .    to make this paper more accessible",
    "we will begin with a theoretical summary in section [ ch : thsumm ] , where we list the key results , supporting them by leading considerations .",

    "sections [ ch : ana ] and [ ch : num ] illustrate how to apply the method in practice .",

    "the reader who is not interested in a rigorous justification of the method can safely ignore it .",
    "our first example is kerr oscillator ( section [ ch : ana ] ) .",
    "this is an exactly soluble problem ; moreover , all calculations in the truncated wigner approach can be carried out analytically . in section [ ch : num ]",
    "we apply the method to the bose - hubbard model , comparing the results to direct calculations in hilbert space .",
    "we consider relatively small chains consisting of few sites to make exact calculations possible , although the truncated wigner approach can be extended to much larger systems ( see e.g. refs .",
    "we find good agreement between exact and approximate results over relatively short time scales , with the applicability of this method to longer times remaining an open problem .",
