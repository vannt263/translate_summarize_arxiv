    "this detectod will have the following features : * * help the track pattern recognition at small radii where beam background is more severe ; * * improve vertexing at ip and interferometry for all - charged events , like @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 ; * * help the identification of kaon interactions in the drift chamber inner wall ( esp .",
