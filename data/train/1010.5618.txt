    "the cryogenic phase of the _ spitzer space telescope _ came to a close on 15 may 2009 .",
    "the infrared spectrograph ( irs , see @xcite ) , one of the three scientific instruments in the _ spitzer _ payload , allowed for spectroscopic observations from 5 - 40 @xmath0 m , at resolutions r@xmath2 60 - 600 .",
    "the end of `` cold _ spitzer _ '' marked the end of the astronomical community s access to this spectral region from space until the launch of the james webb space telescope ( _ jwst _ ) .",
    "here we present the _ spitzer _",
    "atlas of stellar spectra ( sass ) , composed of objects observed with the irs in low - resolution mode ( r @xmath1 60 - 130 ) , throughout its almost six year lifetime . as detailed below ,",
    "most of the 159 stars in this atlas have been chosen because they are typical representatives of their spectral class . beyond this general prescription , a few",
    "have been chosen for their intrinsic interest .",
    "all the spectra in the atlas have been uniformly reduced and all are available to the astronomical community from the nasa / ipac infrared science archive ( irsa ) and vizier",
    ". they will also be temporarily available from the first author s webpage .",
    "the appendix lists the full content of the sass .",
    "the operational goal of this project is to compile representative spectra of a broad section of the hertzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagram , in order to understand the mk spectral sequence ( which is a blue - optical classification ) at mid - infrared wavelengths .",
    "the data are intended to serve as a general stellar spectral reference in the mid - infrared and to aid in the interpretation of observations from other facilities such as the stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy ( sofia ) and the herschel space observatory .",
    "in addition , given its population of massive stars , the atlas may serve to refine galactic synthesis models .",
    "this atlas inherits a rich history of efforts in collecting and classifying the mid - infrared spectra of stars .",
    "most relevant for our work , @xcite produced an atlas of 5425 spectra using the low - resolution spectrometer ( lrs ; 7.7 - 22.7 @xmath0 m and r@xmath120 - 60 ) on board the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( _ iras _ ) and @xcite compiled lrs spectra of @xmath111,200 sources . those _ iras _ data are complemented by spectra obtained with the short wavelength spectrometer ( sws ; 2.4 - 45.4 @xmath0 m , r@xmath1400 ) on the _ infrared space observatory _",
    "( _ iso _ ) . @xcite and @xcite compiled @xmath11000 _ iso _ stellar spectra in order to derive a system of infrared ( ir ) spectral classification .",
    "additional compilations based on _ iras _ and _ iso _ mid - infrared data can be found in the literature ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the samples on those catalogs were limited by the sensitivity of the facilities used and did not provide complete coverage of the spectral sequence . in partcular ,",
    "they were dominated by giants or by evolved stars with strong circumstellar emission . on the other hand ,",
    "the emphasis of the sass is on naked photospheres although , as we will show , it includes stars with circumstellar material as well .",
    "the iras and iso observations have served to develop infrared spectral classifications . the original _",
    "iras_-lrs classification scheme @xcite sorted spectra according to a continuum spectral index or to absorption or emission features . @xcite devised a parallel classification for _ iras_-lrs spectra , which @xcite used to classify the sources in their catalog .",
    "iras_-lrs data have also been classified using autoclass , a bayesian - based automatic technique @xcite .",
    "the stars from the sass have been classified within the iso - based kspw system , as described by @xcite and @xcite ( see section [ contents ] ) .",
    "beyond its utility as a general reference , the atlas characteristics of completeness , uniformity , and availability , make it useful for exploring the role of effective temperature and surface gravity on the development of infrared spectroscopic features .",
    "we discuss here in some detail the behavior of the sio fundamental feature and the h@xmath3o bending mode in late type giants , as well as in the circumstellar environment of m supergiants .    in this paper , we will focus only on a general description of the sample .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ spitzer ] we summarize the characteristics of the irs on _ spitzer_. we then present a description of the sample ( section [ selec ] ) , the data reduction ( section [ reduc ] ) , and the reliability and limitations of the reduction ( section [ relab ] ) . while the contents of the atlas in the appendix are listed in conventional luminosity class order ( wr , class i , class ii , etc ) a better context",
    "can be established by describing the sample in the opposite order .",
    "therefore , in the text we analyze the sass contents ( section [ contents ] ) from main sequence ( section [ ms ] ) to wr ( section [ wr ] ) .",
    "section [ summary ] presents a summary .",
    "here we provide a short summary of the irs as relevant for the sass . @xcite",
    "provide a detailed description of the instrument .",
    "more details about the observing modes and the data processing pipeline are available from the irs instrument handbook .",
    "the irs had two low - resolution gratings .",
    "the short - low grating ( sl ) covered the spectral region from 5 to 14 @xmath0 m , while the long - low ( ll ) grating nominally covered the region from 14 to 40 @xmath0 m .",
    "the resolution ranged from r @xmath160 to @xmath1130 , increasing linearly with wavelength in each module . for each grating , the complete spectral orders 1 and 2 were imaged .",
    "in addition , a short spectral segment belonging to order 1 ( the so - called bonus order ) provided spectral redundancy with the long wavelength region of the second order .",
    "a different detector was used to image the spectra from the sl and ll gratings .",
    "the spectral slits were 57 `` @xmath4 3.7 '' ( sl ) and 168 `` @xmath4 10.7 '' ( ll ) and nyquist - sampled at the longest wavelengths in each module .",
    "all the data included in the sass were obtained in the irs staring mode . in this pointing mode ,",
    "the telescope ` nods ' along the slit , and each observation results in two spectral traces separated by 1/3 of the slit length ( 20  for sl , 55  for ll ) .",
    "the data presented here were reduced with the default parameters of the spitzer science center ( ssc ) irs point - source pipeline s18.7.0 .",
    "the pipeline averages multiple images at the same nod and subtracts the average of the images taken at one nod from the average at the other .",
    "while this method of sky subtraction works well for isolated point sources , it will fail for large extended sources .",
    "the nod - subtracted spectra are extracted by the default pipeline using a tapered aperture with a wavelength - dependent width .",
    "finally , the pipeline divides the extracted spectra by a low - order polynomial ( the ` fluxcon ' ) to obtain calibrated spectra .",
    "therefore , the irs staring mode observations result in two sky - subtracted , calibrated spectra per order for a total of 12 spectra per target .    in the s18.7.0 pipeline , the low - resolution modules of the irs are calibrated using a single standard star , the k1 giant hr  7341 . during calibration observations ,",
    "all the individual extracted spectra of this star are averaged and the ratio between the observations and the marcs model of the star @xcite is fit with a low - order polynomial .",
    "the result of the fit becomes the fluxcon .",
    "the goal of this project is to sample a broad region of the hr diagram , and produce spectra from 5 to 35 @xmath0 m of typical members from a given class . from all the irs staring observations that became public before 31 may 2009 , we primarily selected those stellar targets that had been observed with all of the low - resolution irs modules .    during our exploration of the _ spitzer _ archive it became clear that some spectral classes had not been observed with the low - resolution modules . in addition ,",
    "certain unique objects such as rr  lyrae stars , or certain classes like cepheid variables and blue stragglers had not been observed with the low - resolution modules of the irs .",
    "we requested , and subsequently received , a total of 29.6 hours of director s discretionary time in order to obtain the irs observations of missing or incomplete classes of stars ( ddt 485 , pi ardila ) .    because the atlas spectra should serve as templates to better understand the spectral classes to which they belong",
    ", we did not include known young stars with circumstellar material , stars known to harbor debris disks , or objects classified in simbad as rs cvn stars , be stars , or eclipsing binaries .",
    "these objects do not have a characteristic spectrum or a prototype that could describe the class as a whole .",
    "for example , there is no prototypical debris disk spectrum that describes all of them , nor a prototypical spectrum of an eclipsing binary that would describe all of its phases .",
    "in addition , rejecting those objects allows us , for the most part , to classify stars without reference to their evolutionary state , as a given place in the hr diagram will generally be occupied by only one class of objects .    in the case of bright giants ( luminosity class ii ) , giants ( class iii ) , subgiants ( class iv ) , and",
    "dwarfs ( class v ) , we generally rejected targets presenting ir excesses . beyond @xmath5 m ,",
    "the photospheric ir continuum is relatively flat for spectral types earlier than mid - m . for each candidate star",
    ", we compared its spectrum with ( depending on the effective temperature ) a blackbody function , available stellar templates ( @xcite ) , or an engelke function ( @xcite ; figure [ engelke ] ) .",
    "our determination of excess is qualitative , and low - level excess may still be present in the spectra .    in the case of very high mass and/or evolved stars there are few objects presenting a pure photospheric spectrum .",
    "pulsations and winds , both common occurrences in high mass stars , will often result in an ir excess .",
    "extinction by interstellar dust along the line of sight will also result in a non - photospheric spectrum . in the case of supergiants ,",
    "most spectra included in the atlas are clearly non - photospheric at the wavelengths considered here . in some of them , the presence of emission lines indicates the existence of gas in the vicinity of the star ( section [ supergiants_gen_desc ] ) .    beyond prototypes for each class , the atlas also includes a few stars specifically selected for their intrinsic interest , either because they represent optical prototypes of some variable types , or because they have not been well studied in the ir .",
    "these were included regardless of their ir excess and even if the atlas already contained another star with the same spectral type .",
    "some examples are : hd  205021 ( b1iiiev , the prototype for the @xmath6 cepheid variables ) , hd  182989 ( f5iii , the rr lyrae prototype ) , v836 oph ( m4iii , mira ceti type variable ) , hd  27396 ( b3v , another example of @xmath6 cep type ) , hd  27290 ( f0v , the @xmath7 doradus prototype ) , and hd  88923 , hd  106516 , hd  35863 ( some of the few blue stragglers amenable to irs observations , see @xcite ) .",
    "in general , we have avoided classes that have been fully described with _ iras _ , _ iso _ , or _ spitzer _ , such as asymptotic giant branch stars ( agbs , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "although the irs range extends to 40 @xmath0 m , the s / n of the targets included in the sass decreases rapidly beyond @xmath132 @xmath0 m ( see section [ reduc ] ) .",
    "the spectra in the atlas are presented to 35@xmath0 m , although we only describe them to 32 @xmath0 m . when multiple observations of targets with a given spectral type were present in the archive , we selected the highest signal - to - noise ( s / n ) representative for inclusion in the atlas .",
    "not all sass members have coverage in all irs wavelengths . while we aimed for most targets to have full spectral coverage , this proved impossible at the faintest spectral classes ( late m , l and t dwarfs ) .",
    "these objects are unique enough that we have included them here , independently of whether or not the complete spectral range beyond 14 @xmath0 m is available . for the same reason , we have included some wr stars for which the long wavelength modules are unusable ( due to extended nebulosity which precludes the sky subtraction ) or not present in the archive .    for each target , we searched the literature to find its spectral type .",
    "in general , the spectral types were taken from ( in order of priority ) : nsted , nstars , the tycho-2 spectral type catalog @xcite , and simbad .",
    "we assigned luminosity classes in the same priority .",
    "nsted bases its spectral types primarily on the michigan spectral type catalog , as does nstars .",
    "the spectral types on the tycho-2 catalog are determined by cross - referencing the catalog with primary and secondary spectral type references , including the catalogue of stellar spectra classified in the morgan - keenan system @xcite , the fifth fundamental catalogue ( @xcite ) , etc .",
    "simbad uses all these and complements them by current literature observations . for certain types of objects , specialized catalogs in",
    "the literature served as the source of the spectral types .",
    "for example , the spectral types from wr stars were taken from the 7th catalog of galactic wolf - rayet stars @xcite .",
    "other references are indicated in the appendix .",
    "figure [ graph ] presents a general overview of the atlas contents .",
    "this should be taken only as a cartoon representation of the hr diagram .",
    "in particular , the luminosities have generally been taken from the expected luminosities based on the stellar spectral type , not from actual brightness measurements .",
    "the full content of the atlas is presented in the appendix .",
    "for the data presented here , we used the regions of the spectrum indicated in table [ trim ] . while we kept data up to 35 @xmath0 m in ll1 , fluxes beyond 32 @xmath0 m fall on a lower sensitivity and significantly damaged region of the detector .",
    "the spectra at the longest wavelengths present very high levels of unstable , rapidly varying ( `` rogue '' ) pixels . in order to reduce the number of rogues , the bias level of the ll detector was reduced on 29 october 2007 . while reducing the number of rogues in all regions of the spectrum ,",
    "this procedure also reduced the overall sensitivity .",
    "the combination of large number of remaining rogues plus low s / n at long wavelengths pushed us to only use data to 32 @xmath0 m .",
    "we have not used any rogue cleaning algorithms , such as irsclean .",
    "the sky subtraction procedure we used eliminates the slowly - varying rogues and these are the ones described within irsclean .",
    "rogue pixels and low sensitivity are also a problem on ll2 ( 14 to 20 @xmath0 m ) , resulting in noticeably higher noise in this region . for wavelengths beyond 19.35 @xmath0 m , we replaced the values from ll2 by those of the same spectral region in the bonus order , which presents less rogue pixels .",
    "still , the region between 19 and 20 @xmath0 m tends to be noisier than the other wavelengths in most of the spectra .    for each target",
    "we calculated the offset distance between its predicted coordinates and those of the slit , and rejected those observations with offsets larger than 1.5 \" .",
    "this corresponds to the 2@xmath8 pointing error in the dispersion direction for medium accuracy peak-up.telescope mispointing larger than this results in spectral traces with spurious curvature .",
    "the goal of the s18.7.0 pipeline is to provide spectra with systematic tilts in the spectra smaller than @xmath15% . in certain regions ,",
    "these systematics can be reduced even further , by applying additional corrections to the calibrated data provided by the pipeline .",
    "when these corrections can be described by a polynomial , the coefficients are listed in table [ correc ] .",
    "the corrections that were applied to the pipeline - processed data are as follows :    * teardrop correction : excess emission centered at 13.2 - 15 @xmath0 m is observed in the two - dimensional spectral images , to the left of the sl1 spectral trace . in the s18.7.0 calibration this spectral region",
    "is not included when deriving the flux calibration .",
    "when extracting the spectra using the default point source extraction , the amplitude of the feature is @xmath110% larger than the expected spectral trace .",
    "we compared the effect of the teardrop on 90 dwarf stars with spectral types from a to m and found the strength of the feature to be proportional to the spectrum brightness .",
    "this fact allow us to derive a single polynomial correction which we then apply to all the data ( table [ correc ] ) . * slit position correction : to make use of the better knowledge of the in - orbit performance of the spectrograph , the spitzer science center ( ssc ) changed the slit position tables starting on 19 june 2006 .",
    "these tables determine the orientation of the slit on the focal plane .",
    "the s18.7.0 pipeline provides an average calibration , applied equally to data before and after this date .",
    "we used archival observations of hr  7341 to derive corrections to the spectra ( @xmath9% ) depending on the date they were taken ( table [ correc ] ) .",
    "* residual nod correction : the calibration derived by the ssc and included in the s18.7.0 pipeline is obtained by averaging multiple staring observations of a single source . for a given observation involving two nods ,",
    "the spectrum from the source falls on two different detector positions .",
    "the calibration of the average spectrum in effect corrects for residual flat - field errors . in some of the atlas sources we discard one of the nods , which may result in spectrum tilt errors of the order of @xmath12% . in order to be able to use only one nod ,",
    "we derive nod - specific polynomial corrections based on hr  7341 ( table [ correc ] ) . *",
    "residual model corrections : even after these corrections , significant order curvature is present in sources that should have relatively flat spectra , like a0 stars .",
    "the cause of this curvature is unknown .",
    "the largest excursion from the observations with respect to stellar templates occurs at @xmath18@xmath0 m .",
    "a possible source of error is the way the marcs model of hr  7341 describes the absorption wings of the strong sio fundamental feature .",
    "we compared archival observations of the a0 star @xmath10 lac to a template model for this star @xcite to determine residual corrections to the spectra ( table [ correc ] ) . *",
    "the 24 @xmath0 m flux deficit : spectra of faint sources ( @xmath11100 mjy ) processed with s18.7.0 present a flux deficit at 24 @xmath0 m @xcite , as well as anomalous slopes at shorter wavelengths . for these sources",
    ", we determined an additional multiplicative correction , based on 120 sec ramps of @xmath10 lac and its corresponding stellar template @xcite .",
    "in addition , fringing is observed in the extracted spectra of hd  269858 , rsgc 2 # 2 , rsgc 2 # 5 , bd+23@xmath121138 , and ngc 7419 # 435 .",
    "we have corrected it by applying a 5 wavelength element ( 0.7 @xmath0 m ) boxcar smoothing from 20 to 30 @xmath0 m .    after applying these corrections , multiple spectra of the same source are averaged .",
    "order mismatches are corrected by matching the spectra to the highest value .",
    "remaining tilt errors , calculated by comparing individual nod observations for the same target , are @xmath13 .",
    "the error in the overall flux level is that of the standard irs calibration ( @xmath15% to @xmath110% ) .",
    "the atlas files provided electronically contain an error value for each wavelength , which is intended to represent the random 1@xmath8 error at that wavelength .",
    "this is the error provided by the ssc 18.7.0 pipeline and propagated along the reduction procedure .",
    "however , the treatment of errors remains incomplete in this pipeline .",
    "for example , errors in the flat field are not included , and poisson errors are calculated after dark subtraction . a full study of the validity of the errors remains to be performed .",
    "for the purpose of the atlas , the relative value of the errors seems appropriate to the characteristics of the spectra : overall , the errors are larger in spectral regions that are clearly noisier than others .",
    "absolute noise levels are more suspect , with errors changing substantially between neighboring wavelength bins , specially for faint sources ( @xmath1110mjy ) . the errors provided here should be considered carefully , before propagating them into further calculations .",
    "the default ( tapered - column ) pipeline extraction tends to extend the influence of the rogues over neighboring wavelength bins , giving the appearance of unresolved emission or , in background - subtracted data , absorption lines .",
    "sky subtraction , as well as averaging of multiple frames , eliminates the rogue pixels that vary on timescales longer than the exposure time .",
    "furthermore , the observations included here have all been performed in the irs staring pointing mode , which means that two spectra are available for each pointing . before averaging",
    "we have compared the spectra to each other , to check for anomalously high or low pixels in one nod ( pixels with values much larger or smaller than the noise ) , and replaced them by the value of the spectrum in the other nod . still , especially at longer wavelengths ( where there is more detector damage )",
    ", bad pixels do remain .",
    "as was already mentioned , due to the combination of large number of rogue pixels and low spectral sensitivity , the spectral regions from @xmath114  20 @xmath0 m and @xmath14 m may be considerably noisier than the rest .",
    "note for example the f2v star hd  164259 , in the appendix , which presents correlated noise in these ranges . in spite of its less - than - ideal noise characteristics ,",
    "this star is included in the atlas because the only other f2v in the sample is the blue straggler hd  88923 @xcite .",
    "the processing insures that the spectra do not have strong spurious emission or absorption lines in large s / n regions , that could be confused with true spectral features .    at @xmath16 @xmath0 m , an absorption feature",
    "is sometimes observed ( see the f5v spectrum in the appendix ) . for repeated observations of the same star ,",
    "the exact position and depth of this feature changes with nod and aor . because at 6 @xmath0 m the psf is narrower than one pixel , the presence of the feature is likely due to intra - pixel variations , important only at the shortest wavelengths @xcite . to obtain the final spectra , we have rejected from the average those spectra in which this feature is largest",
    "however , the  absorption feature \" remains present in some spectra .",
    "care must be exercised in interpreting narrow features in this region .",
    "as figure [ graph ] shows , the data span almost 12 orders of magnitude in luminosity and 2 orders of magnitude in temperature . the atlas is most complete at spectral types later than g and luminosity classes iii and v.    the spectra have not been corrected for extinction .",
    "the reddening correction is negligible for nearby ( intrinsically faint ) stars , as 1 mag of extinction in the johnson v band corresponds to @xmath10.05 mag at 8 @xmath0 m @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "distant ( intrinsically bright ) stars show broad interstellar absorption features at 10 and 18 @xmath0 m , and the continuum slope is likely affected by extinction ( section [ supergiants_gen_desc ] ) .",
    "the spectra of most dwarf and giants without circumstellar material are relatively featureless , although for objects with early a spectral types , hydrogen lines are observed for all luminosity classes . besides these , the most noticeable photospheric features correspond to water vapor and silicon monoxide in late type dwarfs and giants , as well as methane and ammonia features at the latest spectral types .",
    "figure [ sptvscolor ] shows that the [ 8]-[24 ] _ spitzer _ colors ( irac and mips , see @xcite ) are poor predictors of spectral type for most luminosity classes , as expected . within a color uncertainty of 0.1 mag",
    ", the spectral slopes of most of the sample can be described with engelke or blackbody functions .",
    "even the development of the sio feature ( section [ giantssection ] ) results in a color difference @xmath11 5% between m dwarfs and giants .",
    "the exceptions are stars for which the excess begins at wavelengths @xmath15 m .",
    "as figure [ sptvscolor ] shows , this is the case with most of the supergiants .    in table",
    "[ big_table ] we have also classified the stars according to the _ iso_-based , kspw system described by @xcite and @xcite . when the class or subclass to which the star belongs is uncertain , we have marked it as ` : ' .",
    "the kspw is a three - level system that takes into account not only the features present in the spectra but also the spectral slope .",
    "therefore , the fact that the spectrum presents evidence of extinction becomes part of the classification ( unlike the optical classification ) .",
    "as with other spectral classifications , the kspw system is tied to the instrument and sample that defines it , in this case , _",
    "iso_-sws , 2.4  45.2 @xmath0 m , r@xmath11000 observations of mostly evolved stars .",
    "the range and resolution of the spectra presented here are smaller , and our coverage is more extensive , which makes the application of this classification problematic to implement .",
    "regardless of these issues , the kspw system provides a shorthand to describe the spectra .",
    "our attempts to classify the sass members within the kspw aim to highlight the areas where more work is needed before a complete , general purpose ir stellar classification is available .    within the kspw system ,",
    "group 1 describes naked stars , with spectra dominated by ",
    "photospheric emission with no apparent influence from circumstellar dust \" @xcite . within group 1 ,",
    "objects are further subdivided as 1.n ( no molecular bands ) , 1.no ( co and/or sio absorptions ) , or 1.nc ( molecular absorption bands indicative of carbon - rich photosphere , hcn , and c@xmath3h@xmath3 at 7 - 8 @xmath0 m ) . as the _ spitzer _",
    "irs range does not cover the co band at 4.4 @xmath0 m , we use only the sio absorption at 8@xmath0 m to distinguish between 1.n and 1.no @xcite .",
    "none of the stars in the sass presents the absorption features characteristic of 1.nc objects @xcite .",
    "stars with interstellar silicate dust absorption but no noticeable excess have been marked as 1.sa ( photospheric slope , silicate absorption ) .",
    "other extensions and interpretations of the system are mentioned in the following sections .    in the discussion that follows , we concentrate on a few of the classes present in the atlas .",
    "we will discuss dwarfs , giants , and supergiants , followed by wr stars .",
    "as was mentioned , at these resolutions and sensitivities the spectra of main sequence stars are relatively featureless until m0v ( figure [ allv ] ) , except for the presence of hydrogen lines .",
    "for example , in the high quality spectrum of hd  213558 ( a0v ) , we observe h ( 9 - 6 ) at 5.91 @xmath0 m , h ( 13 - 7 ) at 6.29 @xmath0 m , h ( 12 - 7 ) at 6.77 @xmath0 m , the blend of h ( 6 - 5 ) and h ( 8 - 6 ) at 7.50 @xmath0 m , h ( 10 - 7 ) at 8.76 @xmath0 m , h ( 13 - 8 ) at 9.38 @xmath0 m , h ( 12 - 8 ) at 10.50 @xmath0 m , h ( 9 - 7 ) at 11.30 @xmath0 m , h ( 7 - 6 ) at 12.40 @xmath0 m , and h ( 13 - 9 ) at 14.20 @xmath0 m . this particular spectrum is the coadd of 48 spectra per wavelength bin . the humpreys line 5.91 @xmath0 m and the 7.50 @xmath0 m blend",
    "are observed in all other luminosity classes , for early a stars .",
    "the fundamental sio band ( blue edge at 7.55 @xmath0 m ) first becomes noticeable at m0v and remains strong until it becomes confused with the h@xmath3o band at 6.75 @xmath0 m .",
    "the red wing of the co fundamental absorption band , at 4.4 @xmath0 m , is noticeable already at g1v , although it is difficult to determine the exact spectral type at which the feature first appears , as most of the band falls beyond the blue edge of the _ spitzer _ spectra .    for spectral types",
    "later than m1v , the same sample of stars included here , with the exception of hd  191849 , has been published and analyzed as a group by @xcite and our description follows theirs .",
    "the water vapor bands at 5.8 @xmath0 m and 6.75 @xmath0 m are noticeable as early as in m0.5v ( hd  28343 ) . in later spectral types",
    "the water bands result in a spurious  emission feature \" at @xmath16.25 @xmath0 m ( e.g.  the m8 dwarf v1298 aql ) .",
    "silicate dust clouds @xcite are partially responsible for the broad and shallow absorption feature at @xmath19 @xmath0 m observed in mid - l spectral types ( for example , in the l4.5 object 2massj2224 - 0158 ) .",
    "the @xmath16 fundamental band of ch@xmath17 at 7.65 @xmath0 m appears in the latest l dwarfs and becomes stronger through the t sequence , and the combination of h@xmath3o and ch@xmath17 absorption from 4 to 9 @xmath0 m suppresses the flux in the spectra of the t dwarfs .",
    "the @xmath18 fundamental band of nh@xmath19 centered at @xmath110.5 @xmath0 m appears in the spectra of the early- to mid - type t dwarfs .",
    "methane and ammonia bands were first detected in brown dwarfs by @xcite .",

    "of the 11 stars identified as pulsating variables , 5 present non - photospheric continua . these excesses present diverse morphologies , from the featureless , cold excesses of hd  27290 , to the structured dust continuum of the mira ceti star v836 oph .",
    "the wr spectra present the well - known pattern of lines of hei and heii .",
    "the wn and wc classes are primarily distinguished by the strong emission of [ ni iv ] , [ ne ii ] , and [ ne iii ] ( 15.5 @xmath0 m ) in wc stars .",
    "the flat - top shape of the [ ne iii ] line is evident even at these low spectral resolutions .",
    "the early - type wn types , as well as some wc stars , show a f@xmath25 slope , indicative of an optically thick wind .",
    "95 @xmath0 m .",
    "the sass also includes several lbvs which make up a very diverse group of spectra , perhaps the result of the different geometric orientations of the surrounding nebulae , different phases in the evolution of the lbv , or different nature of the circumstellar material .",
    "when possible , we have classified the sass stars within the kspw system , which is based on _ iso_-sws observations of mostly evolved stars ( @xcite ) . in some cases , the sass spectral range reaches only to 14 @xmath0 m , which makes the classification impossible .",
    "furthermore the kspw system emphasizes dust features to discriminate spectra and needs to be extended to address the gas continua of wr stars and early o giants .",
    "this last point shows that the kspw system is incomplete , the result of the small sample and unique instrument involved in its definition .",
    "we recall here that the core of the mk system is based on the henry draper catalog and extension , which contains over a quarter of a million stars @xcite , two orders of magnitude larger than the largest ir samples .",
    "our attempts to classify the sass members within the kspw aim to highlight the areas where more work is needed before a complete , general purpose ir stellar classification is available .",

    "<S> we present the _ spitzer _ atlas of stellar spectra ( sass ) , which includes 159 stellar spectra ( 5 to 32 @xmath0 m ; r@xmath1100 ) taken with the infrared spectrograph on the _ spitzer space telescope_. this atlas gathers representative spectra of a broad section of the hertzsprung - russell diagram , intended to serve as a general stellar spectral reference in the mid - infrared . </S>",
    "<S> it includes stars from all luminosity classes , as well as wolf - rayet ( wr ) objects . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it includes some objects of intrinsic interest , like blue stragglers and certain pulsating variables . </S>",
    "<S> all the spectra have been uniformly reduced , and all are available online .    for dwarfs and giants , </S>",
    "<S> the spectra of early - type objects are relatively featureless , dominated by hydrogen lines around a spectral types . </S>",
    "<S> besides these , the most noticeable photospheric features correspond to water vapor and silicon monoxide in late - type objects and methane and ammonia features at the latest spectral types . </S>",
    "<S> most supergiant spectra in the atlas present evidence of circumstellar gas . </S>",
    "<S> the sample includes five m supergiant spectra , which show strong dust excesses and in some cases pah features . </S>",
    "<S> sequences of wr stars present the well - known pattern of lines of hei and heii , as well as forbidden lines of ionized metals . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic flat - top shape of the [ ne iii ] line is evident even at these low spectral resolutions . </S>",
    "<S> several luminous blue variables and other transition stars are present in the atlas and show very diverse spectra , dominated by circumstellar gas and dust features . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the [ 8]-[24 ] _ spitzer _ colors ( irac and mips ) are poor predictors of spectral type for most luminosity classes . </S>"
