    "if one tries to find a solution one realises that the problem seems to be highly overdetermined .",

    "we will illustrate this concept ( where `` triangle '' is replaced by `` quadrangle '' ) in the proof of the following result .    ]",

    ", it can always be achieved that all quadrangles in a single partition of @xmath12 are distinct .",
    "( in fact the author believes that no two congruent quadrangles can occur in a partition where @xmath15 is not contained in the mirror axes of @xmath12 , but this might be tedious to prove .",

    "figure [ fig : equi - quad - nonvtv ] indicates such a partition .",
    "the two coordinates determining @xmath15 can be changed continuously within a small range independently , yielding two free parameters .",
    "one coordinate of @xmath17 can be changed continuously , too , within some small range .",
    "hence we obtain the desired tiling as follows : tile the plane @xmath0 with copies of the square @xmath12 .",
    "dissect each copy of @xmath12 into four quadrangles of area 1 , in some order . in each dissection , choose @xmath15 and @xmath17 such that the resulting quadrangles have not shown up earlier in the construction .",
    "this is always possible since , in each step , there are only finitely many quadrangles constructed already , whereas there are uncountably many choices for @xmath15 and @xmath17 .    at this point",
    "it becomes obvious that questions [ q : frage ] and [ q : tritilnormal ] lead to several variants .",
    "the example in the proof above yields a normal tiling , but in general not one that is vertex - to - vertex .",
    "one may ask the questions for triangles , for quadrangles , for pentagons , and in each case with or without requiring `` equal perimeter '' , or `` normal '' , or `` vertex - to - vertex '' .",
    "the next section aims to give a systematic overview of the questions .",
    "the general property we will require throughout the paper is that a tiling consists of convex tiles of unit area such that all tiles are pairwise distinct .",
    "the tiles can be triangles ( as in the original question ) , but also quadrangles , rectangles , pentagons or hexagons .",
    "we may or may not require additionally that all tiles have _ equal perimeter _ , or that the _ perimeter is bounded _ by some common constant , or that the tilings are _ normal _ , or just _ locally finite_. furthermore , it may be possible to construct a tiling analogous to the proof of theorem [ thm : quad - til - nonvtv ] , that is , by _ tiling a tile _ @xmath11 in infinitely many ways , where @xmath11 in turn can tile the plane .",
    "the connections between these properties is shown in the following diagram .",
    "@xmath24 for instance , equation tells that if there is tiling obtained by tiling a tile @xmath11 in infinitely many ways , then the perimeters of the tiles in this tiling are bounded by some common constant . in turn , the latter is equivalent to the tiling being normal ( since all tiles are convex and have unit area ) , which in turn implies ( by @xcite ) that the tiling is locally finite .",
    "these implications help to give an overview of the several variants of the questions .",
    "the following tables list , for each of the cases of triangles , convex quadrangles , convex pentagons , and convex hexagons , whether there is some tiling known fulfilling the properties in equation , and whether there is such a tiling that is even vertex - to - vertex . because of the implications in equation , if there is `` yes '' in some column , then the entries above in the same column contain also a `` yes '' .",
    "note that `` not vtv '' is usually a weaker condition than `` vtv '' , but a tiling by convex hexagons that is _ not _ vtv is much harder to find than one that is vtv .    [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     theorem [ thm : quad - til - nonvtv ] above proves the case `` quadrangles : tiling a tile , not vtv '' ( thus also the two cases above it in the same column in the corresponding table ) .",
    "theorem [ thm : tritil ] below proves `` triangles : bounded perimeter , not vtv '' , theorem [ thm : quadtil ] proves `` quadrangles : tiling a tile , vtv '' , theorem [ thm : pentil ] proves `` hexagons : tiling a tile , vtv '' , and theorem [ thm : hextil ] proves `` hexagons : tiling a tile , vtv '' .",

    "indeed , whenever we are in the situation to choose @xmath54 and @xmath55 there are at most countably many triangles constructed already .",
    "hence @xmath54 can be chosen such that no triangle with vertex @xmath54 is congruent to an already constructed one , and @xmath55 can be chosen such that no triangle occurring in the two new regions defined by @xmath55 is congruent to an already constructed one .",
