    "in fact , when there is no boundary , the first author and fursikov prove in  @xcite a small - time global exact null controllability result ( in this setting , the control is a source term located in a small subset of the domain ) thanks to the return method and to the global controllability of the incompressible euler equations ( for large smooth initial data ) .",

    "the extension of this method to the navier - stokes equations will be crucial in our proof of theorem  [ main ] .",

    "we will try to highlight a few key ingredients whereas some technical difficulties will be omitted on purpose for the sake of clarity .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a complete proof .",
    "let us also mention here that we are not going to really use a control all the time in the sense that it will be relevant on some time intervals to choose as boundary condition on @xmath25 the same navier condition than on @xmath27 so that the system then coincides with the uncontrolled one for which @xmath36 .",

    "this means for the original searched solution @xmath4 having fast transitions on time interval of order @xmath59 with furious amplitudes of order @xmath60 .",
    "the underlying idea is to start with the ambitious idea to try to control the system during the shorter time interval @xmath61 $ ] with forcing the system to evolve in a high reynolds regime .",
    "regarding the pressure @xmath5 associated with the original solution @xmath4 , having in mind bernoulli s principle which associates the pressure with the square of the velocity , we look for an ansatz of the form @xmath62 this translates the original system in a new system with four main changes :    a.   the new unknowns @xmath57 and @xmath63 satisfy the navier - stokes equations with a small viscosity coefficient @xmath55 .",
    "b.   the initial data for @xmath57 is now small equal to @xmath64 . c.   the time interval is now @xmath65 so that we have to investigate the large time behaviour of the system . in particular , although the initial data is small , nonlinearities will matter .",
    "+ the system for @xmath66 therefore reads : @xmath67 d.   last change but not least , the rest state is now targeted ( at the final time @xmath68 ) with more precision .",
    "indeed we now plan to prove that there exists a solution @xmath57 to the underdetermined system such that @xmath69 in order to deduce from that there exists a solution @xmath4 to such that @xmath70 . in particular , choosing @xmath55 small enough allows to reach a state arbitrarily close to @xmath71 in @xmath72 .",
    "this will provide the approximate controllability result mentioned in the previous section .",
    "when @xmath55 is small , it is expected that the analysis of the system may be built on the small - time global exact controllability of euler equations .",
    "we therefore consider the following counterpart of the system where the viscosity term has been dropped out : @xmath73 as the initial data is of order @xmath74 in @xmath75 it is natural to for a solution @xmath76 to which is , at least for times of order @xmath58 , of the form : @xmath77 plugging expansions into and grouping terms of order @xmath78 yields : @xmath79 by elementary combinations of the equations we observe that the system does not admit any solution reaching exactly @xmath71 unless the initial data @xmath54 is the gradient of a harmonic function , which is not the case in general .",
    "system suffers from a lack of controllability which will prevent from using it for our purposes .    in order to overcome this difficulty we are going to use the return method first introduced by the first author in @xcite",
    "this method takes profit of the nonlinearity thanks to an auxiliary controlled solution to the euler system .",
    "indeed , instead expansions , we will rather look for some asymptotic expansions of the form : @xmath80 where the extra - term @xmath81 is introduced in order to help to control @xmath82 .",
    "of course @xmath81 has to be solution to the euler system in order to cancel out the terms of order @xmath58 which appear when plugging the expansions into the first three equations of .",
    "moreover the last equation yields the initial data @xmath83 in @xmath35 .",
    "the interest is that the equations obtained by gathering the terms of order @xmath74 are now : @xmath84 this is the linearisation of the euler equations around @xmath85 ( rather than around @xmath71 like in ) .",

    "of course the system has , in addition to the transport aspect , non local features due to the incompressibility condition .",
    "still , reasoning on the vorticity of @xmath86 , we obtain that if the fluid particles are flushed outside of the physical domain within a time interval of order @xmath58 , say @xmath88 $ ] ( that is if any fluid particle initially at @xmath89 in @xmath0 moves with the flow associated with  @xmath85 up to some time @xmath90 for which it reaches @xmath25 with a positive velocity ) , then @xmath86 can be set equal to @xmath71 .",

    ", a crucial observation is that the potential flows as solutions to the euler system enjoy a lot of freedom regarding their behaviour in time . indeed if a scalar function @xmath92 satisfies @xmath93 then for any function @xmath94 , the vector field @xmath95 satisfies the first three equations of for an appropriate pressure .",
    "in particular it is possible to choose a nonzero function @xmath96 satisfying @xmath97 , so that this process leads to a field @xmath85 starting from zero initial data and which vanishes at time @xmath43 .",

    "when we need it , we will implicitly extend the previous fields @xmath85 and @xmath86 by zero after @xmath43 .",
    "the difficulty comes from the fact that the euler equation , which models the behavior of a perfect fluid , not subject to friction , is only associated with the boundary condition @xmath102 for an impermeable wall and does not satisfy in general the navier slip - with - friction boundary condition on @xmath27 .",
    "an accurate description of a solution of the navier - stokes equation near @xmath27 , even for a small viscosity , has therefore to use an expansion where a corrector is added to a solution to the euler equation . in the uncontrolled setting for which @xmath36 the description of the behavior of the navier - stokes equation under the navier slip - with - friction condition in the vanishing viscosity limit was performed by iftimie and the third author in @xcite thanks to a multiscale asymptotic expansion involving a boundary layer term @xmath103 of amplitude  @xmath104 and of thickness  @xmath104 for a vanishing viscosity @xmath55 .",

    "let us only mention here that these equations are obtained by plugging @xmath129 into the first and fourth equations of and keeping the terms of higher order ( taking into account that @xmath85 satisfies the euler equations ) .",
    "indeed the pressure @xmath130 has to be expanded as well , into the sum of the euler pressure and of a boundary layer term but the latter can be eliminated from the resulting equation by distinguishing the normal and tangential parts .",
    "thus this pressure boundary layer term acts as a projection on the convective terms and this is why the second term in is only tangential .",
    "the cauchy problem associated with and is well - posed in sobolev spaces .",
    "moreover for any @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 , we have @xmath134 it is easy to check that the solution inherits this condition from the initial and boundary data .",
    "this orthogonality property is the reason why equation   is linear .",
    "indeed , the quadratic term @xmath135 should have been taken into account if it did not vanish .",
    "thanks to the cut - off function @xmath115 , satisfying @xmath116 on @xmath8 , @xmath103 is compactly supported in @xmath89 near @xmath8 , while ensuring that @xmath103 compensates the navier slip - with - friction boundary trace of  @xmath85 .",
    "then it is proved in @xcite that the leray solutions @xmath136 to the navier - stokes equation can be described by the following expansion in @xmath137 : @xmath138 let us highlight that this expansion holds up to any time @xmath31 for which @xmath85 is a smooth solution to the euler equations on the time interval @xmath88 $ ] . on the other hand this analysis fails to describe the vanishing viscosity limit of the navier - stokes equation for large times of order @xmath139 , even in the case where the euler solution stays smooth for all times .",
    "now going back to the controlled setting for which @xmath140 we expect to be able to describe the behavior of the navier - stokes equation near the uncontrolled part @xmath27 of the boundary in the vanishing viscosity limit thanks to a similar expansion . indeed",
    "since we aim at finding a navier - stokes solution satisfying we consider the following refined expansion : @xmath141 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are as lemma [ lemma.euler ] and the vector field @xmath142 is wished to be @xmath143 at time @xmath144 .",
    "if so , and since the fields @xmath145 and @xmath146 are zero after the time @xmath43 , the leading part of the the expansion after @xmath43 is given by the second term in the right hand side and we therefore must understand the large time behavior of this boundary layer . for @xmath147 , the equations and reduce to @xmath148 where the slow variables @xmath149 play the role of parameters through the `` initial '' data @xmath150 .",
    "this heat system dissipates towards the null equilibrium state .",
    "unfortunately the natural decay ( that is without any assumption on @xmath151 ) at the final time @xmath152 only yields @xmath153 which is not sufficient in view of the wished estimate .",
    "physically , this is due to the fact that the average of @xmath103 is preserved under its evolution by equation   and to the fact that the energy contained by low frequency modes decays slowly .",
    "in order to overcome the previous difficulty we are going to use the _ well - prepared dissipation method _ first introduced in  @xcite by the second author in order to obtain a new controllability result of the 1d burgers equation in the presence of a boundary layer . we will here adjust the method to the boundary layers associated with the navier conditions in the vanishing viscosity limit of the navier - stokes equations .",
    "the idea is to design a control strategy in order to enhance the natural dissipation of the boundary layer after the time @xmath43 .",
    "our strategy will be to guarantee that @xmath154 satisfies a finite number of vanishing moment conditions for @xmath155 of the form : @xmath156 this will allow to enhance the dissipation and to improve the estimate into @xmath157 actually we aim at constructing the different fields mentioned so far by restriction to the physical domain @xmath0 of solutions to analogous problems in an larger domain @xmath158 extended across @xmath25 ( and @xmath158 can be chosen smooth , bounded and simply connected ) with source terms compactly supported in the added portion of the domain .",
    "this means in particular that we intend to find a solution that we still denote @xmath66 of the following navier - stokes equations : @xmath159 for @xmath89 in @xmath158 where the source term @xmath160 is a vector field supported for @xmath89 in @xmath161 , of the form @xmath162 where @xmath163 and @xmath164 are smooth vector fields used in order to insure lemma [ lemma.euler ] whereas the vector field @xmath165 is devoted to the control of the moments of the boundary layer .",
    "indeed we now aim at obtaining a profile @xmath103 solution to the following equation : @xmath166_{\\textrm{tan } } }   + u^0_\\flat z \\partial_z v - \\partial_{zz } v   = \\zeta_v    , \\ ] ] for @xmath89 in @xmath158 and @xmath125 in @xmath126 .",
    "since the initial boundary value satisfied by @xmath103 is linear , its moments at time @xmath43 ( see the left hand side of ) , can be decomposed as the sum of an addend due to the right hand side of and of an addend due to the outside control ( see the right hand side of ) , which generates some moments outside , and are convected inside the domain by the field @xmath85 , see the second term in .",
    "indeed , according to duhamel s formula , the second addend is given by an integral over the time interval @xmath88 $ ] , which allows to insure the condition for all @xmath89 in @xmath0 .",

    ", we use the transport by the field @xmath85 as a conveyor belt to serve the wished moments ( compensating what comes from the uncontrolled part of the boundary ) all along the boundary before the end of the service , which corresponds here to the time @xmath43 . in this process",
    "it is crucial to maintain the orthogonality condition ( otherwise the linearity of the equation would dramatically fall down because of the term @xmath135 mentioned above ) .",
    "let us observe that it seems impossible to control completely the boundary layer @xmath103 because the plates need some time to be conveyed from the kitchen and are therefore strongly regularized in @xmath125 ( the equation is parabolic in @xmath125 ) when they are supposed to be compensating what comes instantly from the nonhomogeneous data on the uncontrolled part of the boundary and is therefore far less regularized .",
    "thus a compensation is only possible for a projection on a functional space containing the two types of contributions and we precisely make use of some finite dimensions projections by adjusting a finite number of moments .",
    "going back to the velocity expansion we are led now to the issue of estimating the large time behaviour of the remainder @xmath167 .",
    "the field @xmath167 can be naturally defined as the solution to a navier - stokes type equation of the form : @xmath168 where @xmath169 denotes the pressure associated with the vector field @xmath142 , the notation @xmath170 stands for an amplification operator and @xmath171 for a source term both due to the terms which were omitted in the equations of @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath103 for being of higher order in @xmath55 .",
    "since the field @xmath146 bears the initial data @xmath172 , this remainder starts with a zero initial data ( taking the trace at the initial time of the equality and taking into account that @xmath85 and @xmath103 start with zero initial data ) but is generated by the source term @xmath171 and possibly amplified by mean of the term @xmath173 .",
    "of course the equation is completed with the divergence free condition and some initial and boundary conditions . here",
    "the key points in the large time estimate of @xmath142 are on the one hand that the quadratic nonlinearity in term of @xmath142 which is hidden in the third term of is tamed by a factor @xmath55 , see the velocity expansion , and on the other hand that the effects of both @xmath170 and @xmath171 are tamed by the enhanced dissipation hinted in section [ wpdm ] .",
    "let us refer once more to @xcite for more on the technicalities and only conclude here that the result of an energy estimate is that @xmath174",
    "taking into account that the fields @xmath85 and @xmath86 vanish after @xmath43 , estimates and   plugged into expansion yield and therefore conclude the proof of theorem [ main ] thanks to the preliminary reductions performed in sections  [ sec - red ] and  [ sec - ff ] .",

    ".   provided a smooth initial data , is there a strong solution to the 3d navier - stokes system reaching zero at time @xmath43 ?",
    "the 2d case follows from theorem  [ main ] .",
    "is it possible to deduce from the previous analysis some lagrangian controllability results ? this would extend the results obtained in  @xcite ,  @xcite for the incompressible euler equations and in  @xcite for the stationary stokes equation.this issue is actually related to the previous one as lagrangian setting requires enough regularity for the flow to be controlled .",
    "3 .   last but not least , is it possible to tackle in the more difficult case of the no - slip boundary condition , at least for some favorable geometric settings ? this is a very challenging open problem because the no - slip boundary condition gives rise to boundary layers that have a larger amplitude than navier slip - with - friction boundary layers .",
    "we refer to the nice recent survey @xcite by maekawa and mazzucato for more on boundary layers in the no - slip case .",

    "<S> in this proceeding we expose a particular case of a recent result obtained in @xcite by the authors regarding the incompressible navier - stokes equations in a smooth bounded and simply connected bounded domain , either in 2d or in 3d , with a navier slip - with - friction boundary condition except on a part of the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> this under - determination encodes that one has control over the remaining part of the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that for any initial data , for any positive time , there exists a weak leray solution which vanishes at this given time . </S>"
