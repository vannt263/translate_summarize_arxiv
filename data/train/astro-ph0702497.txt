    "for the last 30 years , the question of whether the solar radius changes with time , and with the 11-year activity cycle , in particular , has been the subject of many controversies . using different techniques , several series of measurements",
    "have been made leading so far to inconsistent results .",
    "even if astrolabe measurements can be considered as extracted from the same statistical population @xcite , @xcite and @xcite reported a variation of the solar radius in antiphase with the solar cycle while @xcite showed the opposite .",
    "in addition , drift - time measurements made photoelectrically from ccd transits at iza@xmath0a and locarno did not show cycle - dependent variations in excess of @xmath150 mas @xcite . using soho / mdi images",
    ", @xcite found no significant variations at any level above 7 mas , which is significantly lower than any variation reported from ground - based instruments ( astrolabes ) ranging from 50 to 200 mas . using the solar disk sextant experiment aboard stratospheric balloons",
    ", @xcite indicated an antiphase variation between the solar radius and the 11-year cycle .",
    "helioseismic methods can also be used to study the variations with the cycle : in this case , a seismic radius is defined from oscillation frequencies of solar f - modes @xcite .",
    "the seismic radius is an interesting probe of the subsurface layers to a depth of about 15 mm , as recently published by @xcite and @xcite ( hereafter lk05 ) . using properties of @xmath2-mode frequencies",
    ", lk05 showed that the variations of the solar seismic radius were nonuniform with depth .",
    "more precisely , lk05 reported a non - monotonic change in the position of the subsurface layers : the radius changes between approximately 0.97 and 0.99  @xmath3 were in phase with the solar cycle while the radius of the shallower layers above 0.99  @xmath3 up to the surface changed in antiphase .",
    "in general , the results are consistent with previous conclusions that solar - cycle variations in the solar radius are confined in the outermost layers of the sun @xcite .    using an evolution code of the sun , @xcite ( hereafter sbdlt05 ) also found a non - homologous variation of the solar radius with depth and a radius change at the surface in antiphase with the solar activity cycle . using the yale rotating evolution code ( yrec ; @xcite and including the effects of a variable magnetic field and field - modulated turbulence",
    ", sbdlt05 found a monotonic variation of the solar radius , sharply increasing in amplitude by a factor of approximately 1000 from a depth of 5 mm to the solar surface between 1996 and 2000 .",
    "both , the helioseismology and model results show that the solar - cycle variations of the solar radius with depth in the subsurface layers are non - homologous , and that the radius change at the surface is in antiphase with the solar activity .    however , there are also discrepancies between the model and helioseismic inferences concerning the amplitude of these variations and the behavior of the changes in the subsurface stratification in the first 15 mm .",
    "lk05 found an oscillation and a change of phase in the first 15 mm with variations not exceeding 30 km , whereas sbdlt05 found a monotonic variation in the first 5 mm with a factor approximately up to 1000 between the depth at 5 mm and the surface .",
    "however , lk05 showed that the helioseismic inferences are not very sensitive to the surface changes .",
    "therefore , to make a quantitative test of the model prediction in addition to the helioseismology data we use measurements of the solar surface radius from the ground and space .",
    "as in lk05 , data used in this study are frequencies of solar oscillation modes from 72 day mdi observing runs .",
    "only @xmath2-modes for the period 1996 - 2005 have been selected .",
    "the oscillation modes , common for the whole period , are extracted to finally obtain 148 modes ranging from @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "we will here simply make a summary of the formalism used in lk05 , and the reader is invited to see that paper for detailed explanations .",
    "a relation between the relative frequency variations @xmath6 for @xmath2-modes and the associated lagrangian perturbation of the radius @xmath7 of subsurface layers has been established by @xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the degree of the @xmath2-modes , @xmath10 is the moment of inertia , @xmath11 is the eigenfrequency and @xmath12 is the gravity acceleration .",
    "this equation is the starting point for our inversion that will permit us to obtain the variation of the position of the subsurface layers determined by @xmath13 and @xmath6 . for these calculations , we used model s @xcite calibrated to the seismic radius @xmath14 km , and the standard regularized least - square technique @xcite ( as we have an ill - posed inverse problem ) . for the inversions , as in lk05 , we select f - modes of angular degree @xmath15 below 250 , for which near - surface magnetic and turbulence effects are not important @xcite .",
    "the inversion of eq . [ eq_radius ] leads to the results presented in figure [ f1 ] which is an update of figure 3 of lk05 .",
    "the figure presents the variation @xmath13 for each year : every difference has been computed relative to the reference year of 1996 .",
    "this updated graph presents the same features than the original one published in lk05 : 1 ) no significant changes in the variation of the subsurface layers depth below 0.97  @xmath3 with a maximal amplitude of about 10 km at @xmath16  @xmath3 ; 2 ) non - monotonic changes in the stratification , with the inner layer varying in phase with the solar activity cycle and the outer layer evolving almost in antiphase with the solar cycle with a maximal amplitude of about @xmath17 km at about 0.995  @xmath3 .",
    "the new result is the radius changes are not precisely in antiphase with the 11-year cycle .",
    "the results for 2005 indicate there might be an additional phase lag between the radius change and activity .",
    "the 2005 data show the same behavior as 1997 data of the previous solar minimum but the new activity minimum is not reached yet .",
    "significance of this result needs to be checked with future data ; if confirmed it may have interesting implications .",
    "in this section , we compare our results with the model results obtained by sbdlt05 .",
    "figure 3 of sbdlt05 shows the radius change as a function of depth below the photosphere relative to the radius change at the depth of 5 mm for their model 4 , which includes both temporal variation of magnetic field and turbulence .",
    "however , the model does not provide an absolute value for the radius variations .",
    "therefore , we have to calibrate the model to obtain the best match to the helioseismic f - mode measurements .",
    "the principle is to use eq .",
    "[ eq_radius ] in a direct way by assuming a value of @xmath18 , obtaining @xmath19 from model 4 , and then calculating @xmath20 from eq .",
    "[ eq_radius ] .",
    "then , we search for the @xmath18 value , which provides the best match to the observed changes of @xmath2-mode frequencies between 1996 and 2000 . for the reference we use model s @xcite calibrated with the seismic radius ( @xmath14 km ) , the same as in the yrec model .",
    "the first step was to digitize the curve at the top of figure 3 of sbdlt05 and transform to the fractional radius .",
    "the panels of figure [ f2 ] show : a ) the digitized curve as given by sbdlt05 ; b ) the @xmath21 computed with different @xmath18 ranging from 0.3 to 1 km ; c ) the associated @xmath22 ; and finally , d ) computed @xmath23 for the different @xmath22 ( color curves ) in comparison with the @xmath23 observed between 1996 and 2000 ( points with error bars ) .",
    "only few sample curves are plotted in panel d ) of figure [ f2 ] , and a study using the @xmath24 parameter shows that the minimum of @xmath24 is obtained for @xmath25 km , which gives a value for @xmath21 at the surface of approximately 600 km .",
    "however , such high variation of the solar radius has never been observed in direct solar limb observations .",
    "in particular , @xcite put an upper limit of 7 mas , or just 5 km .",
    "this means that the theoretical model of the solar - cycle variations can not satisfy both observational constraints , from helioseismology and from the limb measurements . to fit the f - mode helioseismology data it must have the surface radius variations by a factor 100 greater than the observational upper limit from soho / mdi @xcite . in this case",
    ", it also exceeds the observational limit from ground - based measurements by a factor of 420 .",
    "vice versa , if the model radius is within the observational limit then the model can not explain the f - mode data .",
    "thus , we conclude that , according to the mathematical formalism previously described , the strong non - homologous variation of the subsurface solar radius proposed by sbdlt05 is not compatible with the variations of the @xmath2-mode frequencies and the surface radius , observed between 1996 and 2000 .",
    "these computations explain why our results published in lk05 and updated here are in contradiction in amplitude and behavior with the results of sbdlt05 .",
    "of course our computations are completely based on eq .",
    "[ eq_radius ] established by @xcite and on the hypothesis that the temporal variation of @xmath2-mode frequencies are mainly due to changes in the subsurface stratification during the solar activity cycle . on the other hand , the model proposed by sbdlt05 is based on the yrec code @xcite into which the effects of magnetic fields and turbulence have been included .",
    "but , as they said , the location , magnitude , and temporal behavior of the internal field are not known which imply to make assumptions on their treatment . we suggest that the difference obtained with our results could come from their treatment of the turbulence and magnetic fields in the subsurface layers . overcoming this discrepancy between the theory and observations",
    "will help to understanding of the complicated magnetic and turbulence effects below the visible surface of the sun .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that the solar - cycle variations of the solar radius that increase by a factor of approximately 1000 from a depth of 5 mm to the solar surface as published by @xcite ( sbdlt05 ) are not consistent with the @xmath2-mode frequencies variations between 1996 and 2000 and the upper limit on the solar radius change from the simultaneous limb measurements . using their model and the relationship between @xmath2-mode frequencies and solar radius variations",
    ", we obtained a variation at the solar surface of about 600 km which is observed neither with ground - based nor space instruments .",
    "the model of @xcite includes the effects of a variable dynamo magnetic field and of a field - modulated turbulence with general assumptions on their magnitude and temporal behavior ( based on an observed luminosity change of 0.1% and the shape of the activity cycle ) because of the unknown location , magnitude and temporal behavior of these internal fields . nevertheless , we are still cautious on our above results because ( i ) the near - surface effects of turbulence and magnetic fields are not treated in our approach and ( ii ) the lack of very - high @xmath2-mode degrees are necessary to understand the very outer layers ( approximately above 3 mm ) .",
    "so we do not exclude a bigger variation of the position of these layers than those plotted in figure [ f1 ] and that the solar radius at the photosphere by limb observations ( as measured by present instruments and future astrometric satellites ) could be larger than the seismic radius issued from @xmath2-mode frequencies studies .",
    "hence , we agree with sbdlt05 and the necessity to measure precisely the variations of the solar radius from space .",
