    "although the topic of spacetime wormholes was popularized in modern times by the seminal works of morris and thorne and visser @xcite , the original idea traces back to the bridge of einstein and rosen @xcite and even to the embedding diagram of flamm @xcite . in brief",
    ", it is a hypothetical shortcut spacetime tunnel that connects vastly distant points belonging either to the same or different universes .",
    "classical physics prohibits such travels due to instability unless an exotic matter source is taken for granted to support the tunnel .",
    "similar to black holes wormholes are also exact solutions to einstein s field equations .",
    "the idea of time travel through a wormhole , however , transcends classical considerations . to draw a rough analogy",
    "we may refer to the art of escher @xcite , where in the same picture birds transmute into fishes etc . while this transmutation takes place in our minds , for the sake of art , physical theory of wormholes",
    "demands far more than this kind of visualization . in brief",
    "an observer can travel from one universe into the other through a traversable wormhole can also connect distant parts of the same universe . yet in this analogy we can say that in the realm of wormholes einstein meets escher .",
    "wormholes demand physical transition between vastly separated points in warped spacetime in which curvature of spacetime plays the principal role in einstein s relativity and given the suitable energy - momentum such a travel becomes possible according to the laws of physics .",
    "another interesting development took place recently in connection with wormholes : the einstein - rosen ( er ) bridge and the spooky interaction of quantum particles known as einstein - podolski and rosen ( epr ) pair may be related .",
    "symbolically this situation has been summarized by @xmath2 @xcite , which may serve to connect wormholes with the realm of quantum theory .    for these reasons we took wormhole physics seriously and attempted to construct these objects on physical , i.e. , non - exotic matter @xcite . to certain extent we obtained results that employ non - circular / non - spherical throat topology in the wormholes @xcite .",
    "in addition to the energy matters recently we have also revised the well - known flare - out conditions @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we resort to the non - linear electromagnetism to provide a possible source for our traversable wormhole in @xmath0dimensions .",
    "this is the square - root lagrangian of the maxwell invariant which breaks the scale invariance .",
    "being a square - root expression our electromagnetic field is automatically pure magnetic , i.e. , we have @xmath3 as the only non - zero electromagnetic field component .",
    "the energy density turns out to be exotic and under this condition we present exact wormhole solutions . in mt",
    "the idea of a traversable wormhole is introduced and the flare - out conditions which every traversable wormhole must satisfy are also found . in accordance with @xcite the general line element of a traversable , circularly symmetric wormhole in @xmath0dimensions",
    "is written as@xmath4 in which @xmath5 is called the redshift function and @xmath6 stands for the shape function of the wormhole . if we consider the location of the throat which connects two distant spacetimes , at @xmath7 , the flare - out conditions state that : i ) @xmath8 and ii ) @xmath9 where prime means @xmath10for @xmath11 although , in @xcite a throat is a gate between two asymptotically flat spacetimes ( i.e. , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) this condition is not necessary due to the existence of non - asymptotically flat spacetimes as the solutions of the einstein s gravity coupled to different matter fields such as dilaton 2,3,4,5 .",
    "therefore , the only constraint on @xmath14 is to be finite in the domain of @xmath15 having the einstein s equations and flare - out conditions all satisfied yields a negative energy density @xmath16 this can be seen from the @xmath17 component of the einstein s equation where @xmath18 ( @xmath19)@xmath20 from the line element ( 1 ) and the fact that @xmath21 one finds@xmath22from ( 2 ) one easily observes that with the flare - out condition fulfilled i.e. , @xmath23 the energy density becomes negative .",
    "hence , the traversable wormholes are supported by exotic matter which violates the null energy condition",
    ".    wormholes in @xmath0dimensions , relatively , received less attention than the @xmath24dimensional counterparts @xcite .",
    "it worths to mention that the first work on @xmath0dimensional wormholes was studied by perry and mann in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider traversable wormholes in @xmath0dimensions supported by a nonlinear electrodynamic ( ned ) matter source .",
    "the nonlinear maxwell s lagrangian which is employed in this study , namely the square root of the maxwell lagrangian is of the form given in @xcite which was developed further in @xcite .",
    "versus @xmath25 and @xmath26 in cylindrical coordinates ( see eq .",
    "we note that at @xmath7 , @xmath27 is where the throat lies . at the location of the throat the magnitude of the curvature",
    "scalar i.e. @xmath28 is maximum while at large @xmath29 it goes to zero .",
    "the negative energy density gets its maximum value also at the throat while at large @xmath30 it vanishes.,width=340 ]    let s start with the line element@xmath31which we wish to call the morris - thorne type wormhole ( mttw ) in @xmath0dimensions .",
    "note that in 3 + 1-dimensions such a wormhole was introduced by ellis @xcite .",
    "herein , @xmath32 is a real parameter , @xmath33 @xmath34 and @xmath35 the ricci scalar of mttw@xmath36is clearly negative and the geometry is regular everywhere .",
    "the ricci scalar admits an absolute / relative minimum located at @xmath37 while for @xmath38 it vanishes .",
    "furthermore , the only nonzero component of the einstein s tensor is given by@xmath39which yields@xmath40where @xmath41 is the energy density of the matter , supporting the mttw .",
    "it can easily be seen that @xmath41 behaves the same as @xmath42 such that a minimum occurs at @xmath43 upon taking a time slice of the spacetime ( 3 ) and embedding the result in cylindrical coordinates as@xmath44yields @xmath45 and @xmath46 these clearly imply that @xmath47 and @xmath48which is the same paraboloid of revolution as in the @xmath49dimensional mttw @xcite .",
    "we note that @xmath50 is equivalent to @xmath51 in fig .",
    "1 we plot @xmath52 in terms of @xmath53 and @xmath54 this figure supports the idea of having a throat located at @xmath27 corresponding to @xmath7 and therefore @xmath55 where @xmath56 to complete this section we add that a transformation of the form we introduced above , i.e. , @xmath57 helps us to find the more familiar form of the line element of the mttw as@xmath58which suggests that @xmath59 and @xmath60 in ( 1 ) .",
    "once more we stress that in ( 9 ) , @xmath61 so that @xmath7 corresponds to @xmath37 which defines the location of the throat",
    ". there is no need to state also that the flare - out conditions are perfectly satisfied .",
    "let s start with the line element of a static and circularly symmetric spacetime given in ( 1 ) in which @xmath5 and @xmath62 depend only on @xmath30 .",
    "we note that @xmath63 @xmath64 and @xmath65 .$ ] the action for gravity coupled to ned in @xmath0dimensions is given by ( @xmath66 ) @xmath67 in which @xmath42 is the ricci scalar , @xmath68 the cosmological constant , and @xmath69 stands for the nonlinear maxwell s lagrangian .",
    "note that @xmath70 is a coupling constant and @xmath71 with @xmath72 is the maxwell s invariant .",
    "let us remind that historically it was born and infeld @xcite who considered a non - linear version of electromagnetic lagrangian that survived to present time . in their approach",
    "one could obtain the linear maxwell lagrangian as a limiting procedure . in our choice of square - root maxwell lagrangian , however , we shall have no such a limit .",
    "once we let @xmath73 with @xmath74 we arrive at the btz @xcite black hole solution . for the choice @xmath75 ( with @xmath76 ) in 2 + 1-dimensions we recover nothing but the flat spacetime .",
    "it should also be added that the original motivation of ned was to eliminate the divergences in electromagnetic field due to the point charges .",
    "we comment that recently einstein s gravity coupled minimally to the nonlinear maxwell s lagrangian of the form @xmath77 , received attentions from different aspects @xcite . here",
    ", we consider @xmath78 i.e. , @xmath79 with a pure magnetic field .",
    "let us add that the particular power @xmath80 corresponds to the scale invariant case , i.e. invariance under @xmath81 and @xmath82 for @xmath83constant , in @xmath0dimensions .",
    "our choice @xmath84 therefore breaks the scale invariance with physical consequences .",
    "it should also be remarked that @xmath79 in flat spacetime had been studied long ago by nielsen and olesen @xcite in string theory while t hooft @xcite highlighted a linear potential term to be effective toward confinement .",
    "our choice of the maxwell s 2-form is just a magnetic field of the form@xmath85 in which @xmath86 is a function of @xmath30 to be found .",
    "breaking the scale invariance the lagrangian @xmath87 has the interesting property that it confines geodesics @xcite .",
    "the source - free nonlinear - maxwell s equation for the specific lagrangian chosen , is given by@xmath88 in which@xmath89with its dual 1-form@xmath90hence , ( 12 ) yields@xmath91and consequently@xmath92 in which @xmath93 is an integration constant .",
    "we note that , @xmath94 can be easily absorbed in time @xmath95 and therefore without loss of generality we set @xmath96 next , the einstein s equations with a cosmological constant @xmath68 are given by@xmath97 in which @xmath98upon ( 11 ) and ( 18 ) , one finds @xmath99 and @xmath100furthermore , with @xmath101 the only nonzero component of the einstein s tensor is @xmath102 in which a prime stands for the derivative with respect to @xmath103 we obtain as a result , @xmath75 in order to have the @xmath104 and @xmath105 components of the einstein - maxwell s equations satisfied .",
    "next , we consider the @xmath17 component of the einstein - maxwell s equation which reads @xmath106this equation gives a relation between the magnetic field @xmath86 and the shape function @xmath107 in other words , a general class of solutions is determined by ( 21 ) such that the redshift function is zero while the shape function and the magnetic field satisfy the constraint @xmath108from this expression one finds that a possible throat is located at @xmath7 .",
    "we note that ( 22 ) may or may not result in a wormhole .",
    "for instance @xmath109 yields @xmath110 and the spacetime becomes flat .",
    "hence , to have a traversable wormhole one should find specific function for @xmath111 such that the morris - thorne s flare - out conditions are satisfied . in the following sections we give two specific wormhole solutions .      in the first example we consider the shape function to be of the form @xmath112 in which @xmath32 is the location of the throat . this shape function has been found above in mttw in @xmath0dimensions ( see eq .",
    "having @xmath113 one finds the form of the magnetic field which is determined as@xmath114this is a singular function of @xmath30 such that at the location of the throat it diverges .",
    "the maxwell invariant , however , @xmath115 is finite at @xmath116 in addition to that , at large @xmath30 the magnetic field vanishes to give an asymptotically flat limit for the wormhole .",
    "the ricci and kritchmann scalars , respectively , are @xmath117and@xmath118which are clearly regular at the throat .",
    "we wish to proceed now with the investigation of geodesic completeness @xcite in order to verify that divergence of the magnetic field at the throat is of no significance .",
    "the geodesics lagrangian is @xmath119where a dot stands for derivative with respect to the proper time .",
    "the first integrals of @xmath95 and @xmath120 equations are @xmath121the timelike geodesics ( @xmath122)give@xmath123the radial geodesics ( @xmath124 ) yields the hyperbolic curve @xmath125 in which @xmath126 it is observed that for @xmath127 we have @xmath128 which reflects the completeness of geodesics in the wormhole spacetime .",
    "next , for @xmath129 we arrive at the expression@xmath130with the initial time constant @xmath131 this can be reduced to an elliptic integral form and naturally the geodesic completeness is valid here as well .    finally , the tidal forces at the throat can be analyzed through the geodesics deviation equation@xmath132where @xmath133 , ( @xmath134 ) are displacements along the radial and angular directions .",
    "one obtains@xmath135and@xmath136which indicate the finiteness of tidal forces in the vicinity of the wormhole throat .      as a second example we consider the shape function to be of the form @xmath137 in which @xmath138 is a free , real parameter .",
    "note that in order to have the flare - out conditions satisfied we must impose @xmath139 the case @xmath140 has already been considered in our example a. among other possibilities , we consider @xmath141 which yields @xmath142 consequently , the magnetic field and the energy density become@xmath143and @xmath144it should be stressed here also that the maxwell invariant in the present case is @xmath145 which is regular at the throat .",
    "one finds that the proper distance takes the form@xmath146\\]]and the shape function is@xmath147the ricci and kretchmann scalars become now@xmath148and@xmath149which imply that the throat is a regular hypersurfacet .",
    "given the analysis of the previous section it is not difficult to anticipate that the tidal forces / accelerations are finite in this generalized mttw model as well .",
    "due to the power @xmath138 however the integrals of geodesics will not be any simpler .",
    "we constructed a class of traversable wormhole solutions in the theory of gravity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics in @xmath0dimensions . a similar model of wormhole with an anisotropic fluid source",
    "was considered in culetu . for specific choice of the shape",
    "function the solution is the morris - thorne type wormhole in @xmath0dimensions which shares most of its properties with its @xmath49dimensional version .",
    "the matter source which supports our wormhole solution is a pure magnetic field of the form given in ( 22 ) .",
    "the square - root of pure magnetic maxwell lagrangian provides automatic satisfaction of the non - linear maxwell equation in @xmath0dimensions .",
    "confining of geodesics is another interesting property of such a square - root lagrangian @xcite .",
    "we comment that the magnetic field diverges at the throat and vanishes fast with @xmath150 a particularly simple example with @xmath151 is considered . in this example also the magnetic field diverges at the throat while the maxwell invariant @xmath152 is finite at the throat .",
    "next , we consider a more general ansatz which involves an arbitrary parameter @xmath153 we note that divergence of the magnetic field at the throat was used in lobo as a counter argument against existence of such 2 + 1-dimensional wormholes .",
    "the only singularity of the problem lies at @xmath154 which is a naked spacetime singularity but since the wormhole condition stipulates that @xmath155 the singularity at @xmath154 where the scalar curvature invariants diverge remains ineffective for particle geodesics .",
    "finally , we should add that the class of solutions found in this paper consists of a large number of solutions which only depends on the form of @xmath111 .",
    "any choice of @xmath111 satisfying the flare - out conditions acts as a generator and gives rise to a new morris - thorne type wormhole .",
    "the fact that we work in the reduced @xmath0dimensions simplifies the problem to a great extend .  in @xmath49dimensions",
    "obviously wormholes ca nt be generated from a single throat function ."
