    "approximations and simplifications are the key to physical understanding and therefore a large variety of approximations of different nature exist to date .",
    "a physical system can be described often by a hamiltonian , the latter is in most cases not separable permitting only numerical solutions . to obtain them",
    "becomes unrealistically time consuming already for a small number of degrees of freedom .",
    "moreover , even if numerically tractable , there is often little insight gained from the numerical solutions . the same is partially true for the well known systematic perturbation theories .",
    "our concept of dominant interaction hamiltonians ( dih ) aims at the formulation of an approximation which can be solved analytically or numerically with ease , and at the same time provides insight into the dynamics . to this end",
    "we approximate the full hamiltonian @xmath0 in different ways , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , valid in different regions of phase space which are visited in the course of time by a classical trajectory of the approximate system .",
    "clearly , the concept requires classical dynamics to start with since it determines the relevant hamiltonian @xmath1 through its local dominance in phase space .",
    "however , as we will demonstrate , the ( classical ) dih approach produces a qualitative interpretation of the quantum dynamics of the system in terms of characteristic hamiltonian sequences @xmath3 which are classically realized through trajectories in the scattering process .",
    "we apply the concept of dih to planar electron - atom scattering , more specifically , electron scattering from a he@xmath4 ion in the ground state , a problem with enough intrinsic complexity to appreciate the qualitative picture of the dynamics which the dih approach supplies . on the other hand ,",
    "planar scattering is simple enough so that it can be handled quantum mechanically with a reasonable effort which enables us to gauge the dih concept against exact quantum results .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , dih provides even a better quantitative approximation to the quantum results than the exact classical solution .",
    "the present work is also a logical next step in developing further our dih concept which we firstly have applied successfully to high harmonic generation in formulation with one degree of freedom @xcite .    in the next section we introduce the dih concept and describe its prerequisites followed by the formulation of the specific dominant interaction hamiltonians for electron ion scattering , using the far field separation for the interaction among the two electrons .",
    "section three presents the full classical results and those obtained with dihs in comparison . in section four",
    "we interpret the full classical dynamics with the classification of trajectories emerging from the dih approach and show that this allows us to identify and characterize the prominent peak structures in the full classical scattering cross section .",
    "section five presents a comparison of our classical results with quantum calculations and demonstrates how dih can be used to understand and approximate them .",
    "section six concludes the paper with a summary .",
    "let @xmath5 be a collection of hamiltonians which all approximate the true hamiltonian @xmath0 of a system in different ( reasonable ) ways .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath6 is called dominant over a set @xmath7 of phase space points which is defined by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 .",
    "hence , the phase space is partitioned according to segments @xmath7 with different dominant hamiltonians .",
    "we construct trajectories within @xmath7 according to hamilton s equations with the dominant hamiltonian @xmath1 as usual , x = , p = - .",
    "if the trajectory @xmath10 reaches at some time @xmath11 the boundary between two segments , e.g. , @xmath12 , then the hamiltonian is switched for @xmath13 from @xmath14 to @xmath15 , a procedure , which is repeated at all space boundaries a trajectory crosses .",
    "this construction leads to a continuous but not necessarily differentiable trajectory , see the sketch in .",
    "each trajectory is characterized by the sequence of dih , ( @xmath16 $ ] in ) which have been used to propagate it .",
    "the abstract concept becomes much easier to grasp when applied to a specific example which will be the two electron problem with full hamiltonian + + zv_1+zv_2+v_12,v_i= -1r_i , v_12= 1|r_1-r_2| , where the @xmath17 are the two electron momenta and the @xmath18 the position vectors pointing from the nucleus of charge @xmath19 to the electron positions .",
    "what leads to energy and angular momentum exchange between the two electrons and renders the problem non - separable is the electron - electron interaction @xmath20 .      in the _ far field _",
    ", i.e. , when both electrons are far away from each other , we can expand @xmath20 over the electron which is further away from the origin , i.e. , the nucleus . for @xmath21",
    "this gives in lowest order @xmath22 which leads to the separable hamiltonian h_1= 2 + 2-zr_1 - .",
    "the role of @xmath23 in this case is simply to describe that the inner electron 1 screens the nucleus for the outer electron 2 .",
    "of course , @xmath24 also exists with the roles of electron 1 and 2 interchanged .",
    "this approximation is also known as the temkin - poet model @xcite , or restricted to radial coordinates @xmath25 only , also as the so called s - wave model @xcite .",
    "here , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are dih in their respective phase space domain @xmath26 and the switching ( which consists in interchanging @xmath27 ) takes place at @xmath28 .",
    "so far we have not discussed the _ near field _ , i.e. , the situation that the electron - electron interaction is larger than the average electron - nuclear attraction , f || 1 . a little thought reveals that if we would take the corresponding separable hamiltonian by neglecting @xmath29 in ( with @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) h _",
    "= p^2 + + 1r as a dominant one for propagation , it would immediately counteract its dominance , since the purely repulsive interaction @xmath32 leads to increasing @xmath33 and therefore decreasing dominance of @xmath34 .",
    "moreover , an energy preserving switching from one of the @xmath35 is difficult to achieve .",
    "it is much easier to assume that the effect of a purely repulsive dih such as can be concentrated to a single instant in time , where energy ( and angular momentum ) is exchanged among the electrons in a kick , without changing their positions and while respecting the constants of motion of the hamiltonian @xmath34 .",
    "these circumstances provide sufficient conditions to uniquely define the kick as sketched in .",
    "the constants of motion @xmath36 , defined by a vanishing poisson bracket @xmath37 , are given by @xmath34 itself , the total angular momentum @xmath38 and the linear center - mass - momentum @xmath39 .",
    "since the kick is local at fixed distances @xmath40 and @xmath41 , we have in addition that @xmath42const . as well as @xmath43const .",
    "from the last two conditions , one can construct a transformation matrix @xmath44 .",
    "since @xmath45 is conserved , the motion takes place in a plane where we take the interlectronic vector @xmath46 at the kick with @xmath47 .",
    "then the matrix @xmath44 , which transforms the vector @xmath48 before the kick into @xmath49 after the kick , can be parameterized with @xmath50 as k _ = (    rr -2 & -2 + -2 & 2    ) = (    rr -1 & 0 + 0 & 1    ) (    rr 2 & -(-2 ) + ( -2 ) & 2    ) . clearly , @xmath51 , since the modulus of the momentum is conserved , @xmath52 .",
    "the kick can be thought of as a rotation of the momentum vector by the angle @xmath53 followed by an inversion of the @xmath54component , as the product form in reveals .",
    "if , e.g. , @xmath55 , we have @xmath56 such that the force @xmath57 leading to the kick acts in the direction of @xmath58 . consequently , we get with in this case @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "taking into account the near field interaction in form of kicks completes our dih formulation of two electron collision dynamics which uses for dynamical propagation exclusively the separable hamiltonian @xmath14 and its counterpart @xmath15 .",
    "the conditions for switching and kicks and their consequences are summarized in table 1 .",
    ".switching conditions of dih for the two - electron problem with primed ( unprimed ) quantities indicating variables after ( before ) the switch ; the function @xmath61 is defined in .",
    "note that total energy @xmath62 and total angular momentum @xmath63 are conserved . [ cols=\">,^,^ \" , ]      ( ) . ]",
    "for the practical implementation we restrict ourselves to total angular momentum @xmath64 which reduces the degrees of freedom to the two electron - nucleus distances @xmath65 and the angle @xmath66 between the vectors @xmath18 .",
    "the conjugate momentum @xmath67 can be viewed as the angular momentum of an individual electron @xmath68 , where @xmath69 to ensure @xmath70 .",
    "the dih hamiltonian corresponding to reads h_1= 2 + 2 + 2(1r_1 + 1r_2)-zr_1- .",
    "we assume electron 1 to be bound in the ionic ground state of he@xmath4 with energy @xmath71au , and @xmath72 while electron 2 is the projectile starting with energy @xmath73 ( we use atomic units if not otherwise stated ) .    for each classical trajectory",
    "we need to specify 6 initial conditions @xmath74 .",
    "we let the trajectory of the bound electron always start at its outer turning point , i.e. @xmath75au . the projectile starts with momentum @xmath76^{1/2}$ ] where @xmath77au@xmath78 .",
    "finally , @xmath79 ( because @xmath72 ) .",
    "overall , this leaves two free variables @xmath80 .",
    "then , any probability to find a certain value @xmath81 for the variable @xmath82 after scattering can be formulated in terms of deflection functions @xmath83 @xcite , = _ 0^ d^0_0^rdr^0(a - a^*(^0,r^0 ) ) , where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the ranges of the initial variables .",
    "therefore , the important dynamical objects are the deflection functions . they are shown in for the final energy @xmath86 and the final angular momentum @xmath87 of the projectile .",
    "note that the deflection functions are periodic in @xmath88 , since after the interval @xmath89 which corresponds to the distance the projectile travels during one period ( @xmath90 ) of motion of the bound electron , the deflection function must repeat itself .",
    "although the deflection functions seem to be quite different , a closer look reveals that full and dih dynamics lead to similar structural details for @xmath91 but with different quantitative weights .",
    "overall , the dih structures appear to be concentrated within a much smaller range of initial values @xmath92 . in contrast",
    ", the dih deflection function for the angular momentum @xmath93 differs qualitatively since there is no change of the initial value @xmath94 for angles @xmath95 .",
    "the reason is that angular momentum changing kicks according to the criterion can only occur for @xmath96 \\approx 1/2 $ ] for @xmath97 . of course",
    ", for the kicks can be modified to increase the range of @xmath98 which can be changed during dih dynamics .",
    "however , this leads to unphysically strong exchange of energy among the two electrons ( recall that the effect of the kick is an exchange @xmath99 ) .     and initial energy of the target electron of @xmath100 . shown is @xmath91 where @xmath101 is the relative projectile electron energy after the collision , ( a ) exact , ( b ) dih dynamics and the final angular momentum @xmath102 of the projectile electron ( c ) exact , ( d ) dih dynamics . ]      from the deflection functions one easily obtains the spectra for angular momentum and electron energy by integrating the respective deflection function over @xmath103 , see .",
    "as one can see in a the energy spectra of full and dih dynamics agree qualitatively and even quantitatively for the large elastic scattering peak at @xmath104 ( which correpsonds to @xmath105 ) .",
    "the inelastic peak is of comparable magnitude but appears shifted for the dih dynamics . in contrast , the angular momentum spectrum ( b ) differs considerably in both approaches as is already apparent from the differences in the deflection function as discussed before .",
    "however , as we will see later , this does not necessarily mean that the dih dynamics gives poorer results compared to the _ quantum _ solutions than the full classical dynamics . before discussing the relation to the quantum results ,",
    "we come , however , to the classification of trajectories and subsequently the entire dynamics which becomes possible through dih .",
    "the deflection functions in show a rich structure and the question arises if one can classify the different regions of initial conditions with characteristic properties of the trajectories starting from them .",
    "the dih dynamics offers an obvious possibility , namely the sequence of dih or , more precisely switches between dih 1 and 2 ( which we label as event 2 ) and application of kicks if @xmath106 ( labeled subsequently as event 1 ) , where energy and angular momentum is exchanged among the two electrons .",
    "we first document the switching by presenting three typical cases illustrated by the respective trajectories .",
    "excitation ( i.e. , an inelastic collision ) can be achieved by event 2. excitation corresponds classically either to an increase of energy for the ( still bound ) target electron or to exchange of target and projectile electron , as it the case in ( quantum mechanically , these two events can not be distinguished ) .",
    "one can see in d that during the approach of the projectile small amounts of angular momentum are exchanged among the two electrons in the full dynamics while in the dih approach the individual electron angular momenta remain zero throughout the trajectory ( a ) .",
    "the ( single ) switching from @xmath14 to @xmath15 happens in this case very close to the nucleus and is difficult to see .",
    "[ fig : event2]c , f confirm with the small changes in @xmath107 and @xmath108 that there is no angular momentum changing kick 1 involved .",
    "consequently , the inter - electronic angle is basically constant for dih dynamics ( b ) which holds on average also for the full dynamics . only if the bound electron gets on its ellipse briefly on the other side of the nucleus",
    ", there is a spike at @xmath109 ( e ) .",
    "overall , there is a good agreement between full and dih dynamics .    in switching",
    "occurs twice constituting the event 22. these trajectories correspond to a net excitation of the target electron which remains bound with a different energy than at the beginning of the collision .",
    "one clearly sees the two switches where @xmath28 , first @xmath110 and then back to @xmath14 .",
    "the dynamics in the angle @xmath66 is quite similar to the event 2 , discussed before .",
    "again , dih and full dynamics are quite similar .",
    "finally , we show in a collision with an event sequence 12. here , first through dominant electron - electron interaction ( @xmath111 ) , quite a bit of single electron angular momentum is built up ( see third panel ) . indeed the criterion @xmath112 grasps the relatively sudden change in the angular momentum in the exact dynamics ( dashed line in the third panel ) well .",
    "as one can see in the middle panel the angular momentum created induces of course motion in the angle @xmath66 . event 1 around @xmath113 is followed by an energy changing switch 2 around @xmath114 .",
    "the exact and the dih trajectory agree qualitatively , although not as good as in the two previous cases where no angular momentum dynamics was involved ( only events of type 2 ) .",
    "this is consistent with our observation from the deflection function and the spectrum of the angular momentum and could be attributed to the restriction of events 1 in the dih dynamics below a critical angle @xmath115 .",
    "overlooking all trajectories , the statistics of events is quite similar ( see ) with a clear dominance of 2 , 22 and 12. classifying contributions to the electron energy spectrum a according to the event sequences in shows the meaning of the sequences : the elastic peak is clearly dominated by 22 while the inelastic peak is built mostly from collisions of type 12. remarkably , this is not only true for the dih dynamics , from which the classification originates , but also applies to the full dynamics .",
    "this means , that even , if the dih dynamics does not produce very accurate quantitative results , it can be used to generate a classification scheme which also applies to the full dymamics and is suitable to interprete and distinguish different mechanisms , such as elastic and inelastic collisions , etc .    ,",
    "( a - c ) dih and ( d - f ) full classical dynamics .",
    "the general initial conditions for the collision are the same as in .",
    "the specific trajectory has the additional initial values @xmath116 with @xmath117 for ( a - c ) and @xmath118 for ( d - f ) . in the left panel",
    "the trajectories of the target ( ( @xmath119 ) - black ) and projectile ( ( @xmath120 ) - red / light ) electron are shown in space , the middle panel presents the radial evolution of the trajectories @xmath121 and @xmath122 ( upper part ) as well as @xmath123 ( lower part , dashed ) in time , while the right panel records @xmath107 ( solid , ) and @xmath124 ( dashed ) . ]     for ( a - c ) and @xmath125 for ( d - f ) . ]     for ( a - c ) and @xmath126 for ( d - f ) . ]    ) for dih ( dark ) and full ( white ) dynamics . ]    ) , ( a ) for dih dynamics ( b ) for full classical dynamics , for details , see text.,title=\"fig : \" ] ) , ( a ) for dih dynamics ( b ) for full classical dynamics , for details , see text.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "our final task is to assess , how the full and approximate dih classical dynamics performs in comparison to accurate quantum results . to this end , we have developed a propagation scheme for the wave function on a grid in three dimensions which can handle the singular coulomb interactions .",
    "it is described in the appendix .",
    "secondly , the classical collision probabilities have been symmetrized @xcite to obtain approximate singlet and triplet results .",
    "we have collided quantum electron wavepackets with the bound he@xmath127 ion very similarly to the classical collisions process and obtain as a result the spectrum in .",
    "one sees that the elastic collision peak ( @xmath128 ) is roughly at the same position in quantum and classical calculations ( a ) .",
    "the quantum peak is more concentrated about the elastic energy and therefore higher since only discrete excitation of the target electron is possible .",
    "such excitation implies that the continuum electron needs to loose the excitation energy .",
    "the corresponding peaks in the region @xmath129 for the singlet spectrum are not resolved due to the initial wave packet with its finite energy width but lead to a smooth maximum in the quantum spectrum .",
    "even higher excitation energies lead to lower final momentum for the projectile and in this semiclassical regime quantum and classical spectra come together .",
    "similar considerations for the angular momentum spectrum require a discretization of the continuous classical angular momentum which can be done by binning @xcite .",
    "the comparison shown in b reveals that the symmetrized dih result is in better quantitative agreement with the quantum spectrum , in particular for the triplet symmetry , than the full classical calculation .",
    "this may be attributed to the fact that the quantum triplet dynamics is less reactive than the singlet dynamics due to a symmetry enforced nodal line at @xmath28 .",
    "classically , this effect is resembled to a certain degree by the dih dynamics compared to the full classical dynamics since in the former `` reactivity '' is limited to the events 1 and 2 , discrete in time .",
    "we have introduced the concept of dominant interaction hamiltonians which approximates dynamics described by a complicated , non - separable classical hamiltonian with different simplified hamiltonians .",
    "each of them is valid in a specific phase space volume where it dominates all other simplified hamiltonians formulated .",
    "applied to planar electron - ion scattering , we have demonstrated that the dih approach provides a good approximation to the full classical dynamics . more importantly , and somewhat surprisingly ,",
    "quantum results regarding differential spectra ( energy and angular momentum of the projectile ) agree better with the dih result than with the full classical dynamics .",
    "whether this is accidental or systematic will have to be investigated in future studies .",
    "a second appealing aspect of the dih concept is the qualitative picture it generates for the dynamics through the sequence of dih hamiltonians passed by trajectories .",
    "we could show that prominent peaks in the quantum mechanical differential energy spectrum can be associated and therefore interpreted with characteristic dih sequences .",
    "this opens the way to classify and understand complicated dynamics through dihs . for further quantitative improvement of dih",
    "the next natural step will be the formulation of a semiclassical extension of dih .",
    "[ [ section ] ]      in this section we give a detailed account of the propagation scheme used to numerically solve the time - dependent schroedinger equation ( tdse ) for the two - electron problem in section [ sec : quantum ] .",
    "applying the infinite - nucleus approximation and restricting ourselves to the case of zero total angular momentum , the number of degrees of freedom reduces to three and the corresponding hamiltonian in coordinate representation is ( cf . ) @xmath130 with the potential @xmath131 this system has been treated with a finite - difference method in @xcite , our approach presented here uses a spectral method .      for the direct numerical integration of the tdse we use the script language _ xmds _ ( www.xmds.org ) which offers a variety of algorithms for solving partial differential equations .",
    "as the wavefunction @xmath132 is represented on a discretized grid in the coordinates ( @xmath133 ) , the partial derivatives with respect to all three spacial variables are evaluated by means of fast - fourier transform ( fft ) . for the evolution in time",
    "we employ an explicit @xmath134 order runge - kutta method with an adaptive time step , enabling us to put an upper limit of @xmath135 for the relative error per timestep .",
    "furthermore , xmds allows for an easy parallelization of the simulation .",
    "a detailed description of the algorithm can be found in the documentation of xmds @xcite .",
    "the crucial step is to define a suitable grid in the coordinates ( @xmath133 ) , thereby accounting for the singularities of the hamiltonian of eq . at @xmath136 and @xmath137 , the boundary conditions for the wavefunction , and the long - range character of the coulomb interaction , which is especially important in electron - atom scattering .    in each coordinate @xmath138 , where @xmath139 or @xmath66 , the grid consists of @xmath140 points which are distributed equidistantly ( due to fft ) over the interval @xmath141 $ ] .",
