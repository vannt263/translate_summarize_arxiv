    "nuclear star clusters ( ncs ) are massive star clusters coincident with the photocenters of galaxies .",
    "they are very common and have been found in @xmath275% of local late - type spirals @xcite and virgo dwarf elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "their size is similar to that of globular clusters @xcite , but ncs are 1 - 2 orders of magnitude brighter and more massive @xcite . also , unlike most globular clusters",
    ", they have extended star formation histories @xcite and complex morphologies @xcite .",
    "the luminosity of nuclear star clusters correlates with galaxy luminosity in both ellipticals @xcite and spirals @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that the masses of ncs follow scaling relationships with galaxy mass ( @xmath3 ) , bulge velocity dispersion ( @xmath4 ) , and srsic index @xcite .",
    "these scaling relations are very similar to those seen for massive black holes ( mbhs ) , appearing to extend those relations to lower masses .",
    "thus , @xcite and @xcite suggest that there may be a single scaling relation linking the mass of a central massive object ( cmo ; either a nc or mbh ) to the large - scale properties of the galaxy .",
    "the existence of an @xmath5 or @xmath6 relation suggests that the formation of the cmo is linked in some way to the evolution of the galaxy .",
    "theoretically , these scaling relationships can be understood in multiple ways .",
    "they could be created by feedback from either ncs or mbhs regulating the star formation in the galaxy as a whole ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or alternatively , they could simply result from gas accretion onto the nucleus in proportion to the galaxies mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "despite this interesting connection between ncs and mbhs , and their link to galaxy formation and evolution , no systematic study of the overlap between these classes of objects exists . a handful of objects , including the milky way , are already known to host both ncs and mbhs ( see  [ litsec ] ) . @xcite and @xcite",
    "show there is a rough transition at galaxy masses of @xmath210@xmath7  m@xmath1 ( and corresponding cmo mass of @xmath210@xmath8  m@xmath1 ) , above which galaxies typically host mbhs , and below which galaxies have ncs .",
    "while there is good evidence that more massive galaxies do not in fact host ncs @xcite , it remains unclear how common mbhs are in lower mass galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "recent theoretical work shows that mbhs could form from stellar mergers in a young , dense cluster environment @xcite , and a direct link between nc and mbh formation may therefore exist .",
    "we present a systematic study of the overlap between ncs and mbhs aimed at better understanding the relation between the two types of objects and the formation mechanism of cmos in general . starting with a sample of galaxies with known ncs",
    ", we search for active galactic nuclei ( agn ) that are powered by accretion onto an mbh .",
    "this study gives a lower limit on the number of systems with mbhs , since quiescent and heavily obscured mbhs will not be detected as agn .",
    "we begin by describing our sample of galaxies with ncs , drawn from several different catalogs (  [ samplesec ] ) . using optical spectra and radio and x - ray data ,",
    "we examine our sample galaxies for evidence of agn activity (  [ agnsec ] ) .",
    "we then review galaxies for which detections of both agn or mbhs and ncs exist in the literature (  [ litsec ] ) .",

    "for instance , in the liner galaxy m61 ( ngc  4303 ) , the recently formed stars provide more than enough ionizing flux to explain the observed h@xmath30 emission @xcite , suggesting that liners may sometimes just be caused by bursts of star formation . however , we note that in the context of our sample , a majority of the liners are found in early type spiral galaxies , whose ncs are known to only rarely host significant young stellar populations @xcite .",
    "the nature of composite or transition objects , proposed to be a mix of agn emission and star formation , is even more difficult to determine @xcite . from a radio survey of the hfs97 catalog",

    "the @xmath38 galaxies with first detections in our sample all have luminosities @xmath79  w  hz@xmath34 , which is unsurprising given the low masses of galaxies in our sample and the observed correlation between galaxy mass and radio - loudness @xcite .",

    "for instance , dynamical modelling by @xcite of the dense @xmath151  m@xmath1 cluster mgg  11 in m82 shows that runaway collisions of massive stars leads to the formation of a black hole with mass @xmath152 of the mass of the cluster .",
    "star formation episodes in ncs could certainly reproduce the high densities and massive star formation required for this mode of mbh formation .",
    "however , the mbhs in at least some of the ncs in our sample have masses nearly equal to that of the nc ; further accretion onto the mbh would be required to explain these cases . also , if mbhs were a natural consequence of nc formation , we might expect to see a higher fraction of agn in galaxies with ncs than for the general galaxy population ; this does not appear to be the case ( see  [ dissec].1 ) .",
    "these lines of evidence suggest that if there is a link between formation of ncs and mbhs , the ncs provide at most seed black holes which can then accrete into a more massive black hole .",
    "the lack of ncs in high mass galaxies also provides a clue to the evolution of cmos .",
    "it is possible that during the buildup of more massive galaxies , the ncs could be destroyed ( e.g. , by black hole merging ; * ? ? ?",

    "this suggests that nuclear clusters do not play a strong role in promoting or limiting the activity of massive black holes .",
    "in four galaxies with ncs and measured black hole masses the ratios of the mbh mass to the nc mass are between 0.1 and 1 .",
    "the luminosity of the agn in our sample of galaxies with ncs are also consistent with these mass ratios .",
    "however , the non - detection and low masses of mbhs in local group ncs suggest a much wider range of mbh - to - nc mass ratios .",
    "4 .   for galaxies of the same mass ,",
    "ncs in late - type spiral galaxies are typically an order of magnitude less massive than those in elliptical galaxies .",
    "this result will be discussed further in a forthcoming paper .",
    "although the data presented here provide compelling evidence for a significant overlap between the mbh and nc population , the evidence for the presence of an active mbh in many of the individual objects is quite weak .",
    "a number of observations could strengthen this evidence , including high - resolution _ chandra _ observations or _ spitzer _ mid - ir spectroscopy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , less than half of the galaxies in our sample have available optical spectroscopy  obtaining spectroscopy for more is desirable and will help fill gaps in parameter space ( e.g. , the lack of spectra of low - mass early type spiral ) .",
    "finally , detailed studies of objects with both ncs and mbhs will be required to improve our understanding of the connections between these central massive objects .",

    "<S> , we classify 10% of the galaxies as agn and an additional 15% as composite , indicating a mix of agn and star - formation spectra . the fraction of nucleated galaxies with agn increases strongly as a function of galaxy and nuclear star cluster mass . for galaxies with both a nc and a black hole , </S>",
    "<S> we find that the masses of these two objects are quite similar . however , non - detections of black holes in local group nuclear star clusters show that not all clusters host black holes of similar masses . we discuss the implications of our results for the formation of nuclear star clusters and massive black holes . </S>"
