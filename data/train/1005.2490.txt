    "inspection of the particle data group ( pdg ) tables @xcite reveals that most excited mesons and baryons have strong decay modes involving more than two lighter hadrons .",
    "moreover , one also verifies that many of these decays can be considered `` cascades '' of decays from intermediate states involving one or more resonances .",
    "a few mesonic examples of such processes are @xcite    1 .",
    "@xmath3 + 2 .",
    "@xmath4 + 3 .",
    "@xmath5    in the first example , @xmath6 stands for @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the very broad @xmath9 @xcite scalar resonance . in all three cases , the final state contains 3 or even 4 mesons that are stable with respect to strong interactions . in order to describe such processes in a mathematically rigorous way , respecting unitarity",
    ", one would have to resort to ( relativistic ) faddeev @xcite or yakubovsky @xcite equations , respectively , in the scattering regime . as a matter of fact",
    ", such a faddeev approach was applied @xcite to the @xmath10 , as a three - body resonance in @xmath11 and @xmath12 , though not including the @xmath13 component and also not the 4-body @xmath14 channel .",
    "note that solving relativistic 3- or 4-body equations with many channels is already a huge task , but it becomes absolutely impracticable if one wants to go beyond an effective description as in ref .",
    "@xcite , by taking into account the quark substructure of the decaying resonance .    in experimental data analyses ,",
    "one often falls back upon dispersive or purely phenomenological parametrisations , as e.g.  in refs .",
    "@xcite for the description of the @xmath15 channel in @xmath1-wave @xmath2 scattering above 1  gev and the @xmath16 resonance .",
    "an alternative , theoretical approach is to interpret the intermediate state in a cascade decay as a ( quasi-)final state , containing one or two resonances as outgoing particles .",
    "the problem then arises how to deal with the , in principle , complex mass(es ) of the resonance(s ) , while preserving two - body unitarity .",
    "one way is by discretising the resonance real - mass distribution(s ) , and accordingly including a large number of channels having the corresponding threshold energies , with relative coupling strengths given by the mass - distribution function .",
    "something in this spirit has been carried out in a coupled - channel description of @xmath1-wave meson - meson scattering in a chiral unitary model @xcite .",
    "a drawback of such a method is the proliferation of channels , besides the problem of properly dealing with resonances not far above threshold .    in the present study",
    ", we shall try out a novel , intuitive approach , by simply substituting complex values for the masses of the final - state resonances , according to their listed @xcite real ( breit - wigner ) masses and widths .",
    "although this step inexorably destroys unitarity , we can afterwards restore it by a suitable redefinition of the @xmath0-matrix .",
    "this quite general procedure is then applied to a concrete test case , in the framework of the resonance - spectrum expansion .",
    "the resonance - spectrum expansion ( rse ) is a model for the scattering of two mesons in non - exotic channels , via an infinite set of intermediate @xmath17-channel @xmath18 states , i.e. , a kind of regge propagators @xcite .",
    "the confinement spectrum for these bare @xmath18 states can , in principle , be chosen freely , but in all successful phenomenological applications so far we have used a harmonic - oscillator ( ho ) spectrum with flavour - indepedent frequency ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for several references ) .",
    "because of the separability of the effective meson - meson interaction , the rse model can be solved in closed form . the relevant born and one - loop diagrams are depicted in fig .  [ bornloop ] .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     for @xmath19 meson - meson channels and several @xmath18 channels , the effective potential has the form @xmath20 where the rse propagator @xmath21 contains an infinite tower of @xmath17-channel bare @xmath18 states , corresponding to the spectrum of an , in principle , arbitrary confining potential . here , @xmath22 is the discrete energy of the @xmath23-th recurrence in @xmath18 channel @xmath24 , @xmath25 @xcite is the corresponding coupling to the @xmath26-th meson - meson channel , @xmath27 is the @xmath28-th order spherical bessel function , @xmath29 is the relativistically defined off - shell relative momentum in meson - meson channel @xmath26 , @xmath30 is a distance parameter , and @xmath31 is an overall coupling constant .",
    "note that the spherical bessel function results from assuming @xmath32 @xmath18 pair creation / annihilation only to take place at a certain distance @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the closed - form off - energy - shell @xmath33-matrix then reads @xmath34 & & \\!\\!\\!\\ ! -2\\lambda^2r_0\\,\\sqrt{\\mu_ip_i\\mu'_jp'_j}\\:{j^{i}_{l_{i}}}(p_ir_0)\\sum_{m=1}^{n } { \\mathcal{r}}_{im}(e)\\,\\left\\{[{1\\!\\!1}-\\omega\\,\\mathcal{r}]^{-1}\\right\\}_{\\!mj}\\ , { j^{j}_{l_{j}}}(p'_jr_0)\\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\[-5 mm ] \\nonumber \\label{tfinal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 with @xmath36 the spherical hankel function of the first kind , and @xmath37 the on - shell relative momentum in meson - meson channel @xmath23 .",
    "finally , the corresponding unitary and symmetric ( on - shell ) @xmath0-matrix is given by @xmath38 note that the @xmath0-matrix is only unitary for real @xmath39 , and so for real meson masses in channel @xmath26 .",
    "as mentioned above , if we take a complex mass in any of the meson - meson channels , the @xmath0-matrix ceases to be unitary , but stays symmetric .",
    "this requires a redefinition of the @xmath0-matrix .",
    "now , note that @xmath40 is not unity anymore , but it is still a hermitian matrix , by definition , and so with real eigenvalues , which moreover are all positive in this special case .",
    "thus , @xmath41 can be diagonalised by a unitary matrix @xmath42 : @xmath43 define now @xmath44 where @xmath45 is real , because of the positive eigenvalues .",
    "then , it is straightforward to show that @xmath46 it is not so easy to prove that @xmath47 is also symmetric , but this has been checked numerically with a precision of better than one part in a trillion .",
    "let us now use the redefined @xmath0-matrix of eq .",
    "( [ sunitary ] ) in a purely comparative calculation .",
    "starting point is our @xcite application of the rse to @xmath1-wave @xmath2 scattering , with pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar , vector - vector , and scalar - scalar channels included .",
    "then , we substitute complex values for the masses of the broadest resonances in some of these channels , namely for the @xmath9 ( alias @xmath8 ) , @xmath48 ( alias @xmath49 ) , and @xmath50 meson .",
    "note that the precise values we take for the complex masses of the very broad @xmath8 and @xmath49 resonances are not so important here , but in future model fits to the data one should use the best available , `` world - average '' values for the corresponding pole positions . in fig .",
    "[ realcomplex ] , we plot the curves for the two cases .",
    "quite significant differences become evident , especially above 1  gev .",
    "nevertheless , the curve obtained with @xmath47 in eq .",
    "( [ stilde ] ) and complex masses looks reasonable , though no refit has been done .",
    "in the present study , we have carried out an empirical procedure in order to restore unitarity of a coupled - channel @xmath0-matrix with complex masses in the asymptotic states .",
    "although no rigorous mathematical justification is given here for the purely algebraic transformation of the original @xmath0-matrix , preservation of the mandatory symmetry of @xmath0 gives us confidence that the method makes sense .",
    "a direct comparison of @xmath1-wave @xmath2 phase shifts , first calculated with the original @xmath0 and using real masses for the @xmath8 , @xmath50 , and @xmath49 resonances in some of the coupled channels , and then with the @xmath47 of eq .",
    "( [ stilde ] ) and complex values for the latter masses , shows significant yet reasonable changes .",
    "nevertheless , our procedure will have to be tested in concrete fits to the data so as to find out whether it is really a promising new approach to multiparticle hadronic decays .",
    "we thank the organisers for another exciting and very pleasant workshop .",
