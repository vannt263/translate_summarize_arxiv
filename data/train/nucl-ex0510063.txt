    "due to their large masses , charm quarks provide a unique tool to probe the partonic matter created in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "charm quarks are produced in the early stages of high - energy heavy - ion collisions  @xcite and their charm total cross - section follows the number of binary collision ( @xmath8 ) scaling from @xmath10 , @xmath9+au to au+au collisions at rhic energies .",
    "theoretical calculations  @xcite have shown that the charm quarks interacting with surrounding partons in the medium could change their properties , such as the @xmath3 shape , etc . notably , charm quarks are believed to lose less energy compared to light quarks in the partonic matter due to the so - called  dead - cone \" effect  @xcite .",
    "thus , measurements of the @xmath11 mesons together with the charm - hadron decayed single electrons - their @xmath3 distributions and nuclear modification factors - will be vital to interpret the physics in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the data used for this analysis were taken with the star experiment during the @xmath2=200 gev au+au run in 2004 at rhic .",
    "a minimum bias au+au collision trigger was defined by requiring coincidences between two zero degree calorimeters .",
    "a total of 13.3 and 7.6 million minimum bias triggered au+au collision events are used for the @xmath0 reconstruction and the time - of - flight ( tof ) single electron analysis , respectively . for the centrality dependence study of the single electrons ,",
    "the minimum bias event sample is subdivided into three centrality bins : 0 - 20% , 20 - 40% and 40 - 80% .",
    "the low @xmath3 ( @xmath12 gev/@xmath5 ) @xmath0 mesons were reconstructed through their decay @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) with a branching ratio of 3.83% .",
    "analysis details can be found in ref .",

    "[ fig : figure1 ] shows the invariant mass distributions of kaon - pion pairs after mixed - event background subtraction ( solid circles ) and an additional linear residual background subtraction ( open circles ) .",
    "the solid circle distributions are then fit with a gaussian plus a linear function to extrapolate the signal of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "after the fit , the @xmath0 mass and width is found to be 1868@xmath71 mev/@xmath15 and 6@xmath72 mev/@xmath15 , respectively .",
    "three other @xmath0 signals are also observed in different @xmath3 bins : 0.2@xmath60.7 gev/@xmath5 , 0.7@xmath61.2 gev/@xmath5 and 1.2@xmath62 gev/@xmath5 .",
    "distributions for inclusive ( solid circles ) , photonic ( open circles ) , and single ( solid squares ) electrons .",
    "( c ) the ratio of inclusive electrons to the photonic backgrounds in minimum bias au+au ( solid squares ) and @xmath9+au ( open circles ) collisions . ]    by using the combined information from the star tpc and tof detectors , electrons can be identified and measured .",
    "detailed analysis for the inclusive , photonic and single electron reconstruction can be found in ref .",
    "their @xmath3 spectra are shown in panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1 ] . panel ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1 ] shows the ratio of inclusive electrons to the photonic backgrounds as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "a significant excess is observed at @xmath161 gev/@xmath5 that is expected to be dominated by electrons from semi - leptonic decays of charm - hadrons .",
    "panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2 ] shows the @xmath3 distributions of @xmath0 and single electrons in minimum bias au+au , @xmath9+au and @xmath10 collisions at @xmath2=200 gev . using a combined fit applied to both , directly reconstructed @xmath0 and the single electron distribution in au+au collisions ,",
    "the mid - rapidity @xmath0 yield is then obtained and converted to the charm total cross - section per nucleon - nucleon collision ( @xmath17 ) following the method addressed in ref .",
    "@xmath17 is measured to be 1.11@xmath70.08(stat.)@xmath70.42(sys . )",
    "mb from minimum bias au+au collisions which is comparable to @xmath17=1.4@xmath70.2@xmath70.2 mb in minimum bias @xmath9+au collisions at @xmath2=200 gev .",
    "thus the charm total cross - section roughly follows the @xmath8 scaling from @xmath9+au to au+au collisions which supports the conjecture that charm quarks are produced at early stages in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "distributions of @xmath0 in au+au ( filled stars ) and @xmath9+au ( open stars ) collisions and single electrons in au+au ( solid circles ) , @xmath9+au ( open circles ) and @xmath10 ( open squares ) collisions .",

    "[ fig : figure3 ] ) are calculated by dividing the @xmath0 data points in minimum bias au+au collisions by the power - law fit results of the @xmath0 @xmath3 spectrum in @xmath9+au collisions scaled by @xmath8 .",
    "the single electron @xmath3 spectra are also measured in three collision centralities in au+au collisions : 0 - 20% , 20 - 40% and 40 - 80% , shown in panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3 ] and compared to the @xmath20 decayed shape in @xmath9+au collisions scaled by @xmath8 .",
    "the spectra in minimum bias and 0 - 20% au+au collisions significantly deviate from the curves .",
    "the single electron @xmath19 in minimum bias and 0 - 20% central au+au collisions can then be calculated by dividing the corresponding data points by their referring curves , shown as solid circles and squares in panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3 ] , respectively .",
    "the single electron @xmath19 in both minimum bias and 0 - 20% central au+au collisions is observed to be significantly below unity at 1@xmath64 gev/@xmath5 and is consistent with theoretical predictions in  @xcite by considering charm quark radiation energy loss with @xmath21=14 gev/@xmath15/fm indicating that the charm @xmath3 spectra must have been modified by the hot and dense medium in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",

    "solid and dashed curves are theoretical predictions for single electron @xmath19 in  @xcite with different parameter settings . ]",
    "in conclusion , the @xmath0 and the non - photonic single electron @xmath3 distributions are measured in au+au collisions at @xmath2=200 gev at star . within the present statistical and systematic errors ,",
    "the charm total cross - section per nucleon - nucleon collision is consistent with @xmath8 scaling from @xmath9+au to au+au collisions indicating the charm quarks are mostly produced in early stages at relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the single electron nuclear modification factors in 0 - 20% centrality and minimum bias au+au collisions are measured to be significantly below unity at 1@xmath64 gev/@xmath5 .",
    "therefore we conclude that the charm @xmath3 spectra are indeed modified by the hot and dense medium in relativistic heavy - ion collisions at rhic energies .",
