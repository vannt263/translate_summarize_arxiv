    "magnetars are isolated neutron stars whose emission is thought to be powered by the decay of intense magnetic fields @xcite . their persistent x - ray spectrum shows two peaks , near 1  kev and above 100  kev ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the soft x - ray component likely comes from the neutron star surface .",
    "its spectrum is modified from a simple planck shape by the radiative transfer in the atmosphere and magnetosphere of the star , and it has a soft tail extending to @xmath1  kev where the hard component takes over .",
    "the hard x - rays must be produced in the magnetosphere of the neutron star .",
    "for a few magnetars , phase - resolved spectra were measured in the hard x - ray band ( den hartog et al . 2008a , b ) .",
    "they showed bizarre variations with rotational phase .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed a model of decelerating @xmath0 outflow that makes specific predictions for the hard x - ray spectrum and its variation with rotational phase . in the present paper ,",
    "we test the model against observations of three magnetars , 1e  1841045 , 4u  0142 + 61  and 1rxs  j17084009  ( all discovered as anomalous x - ray pulsars ) . the model is briefly described in section  [ model_desciption ] , and the results of data analysis are presented in section  [ data_fit ] .",
    "we find that the model successfully fits the data and discuss implications of our results in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "in the model , the hard x - ray emission is powered by the @xmath2 discharge near the star .",
    "the discharge voltage exceeds @xmath3  v and the initial lorentz factor of created @xmath2 exceeds @xmath4 ( beloborodov & thompson 2007 ) . as the @xmath0 pairs flow out along the magnetic field lines and fill the extended magnetic loop , they decelerate via resonant scattering of thermal x - rays .",
    "@xcite showed that the outflow has two zones , adiabatic and radiative .",
    "the adiabatic zone is near the star where magnetic field @xmath5  g ; in this zone the resonantly scattered photons quickly convert to pairs , increasing the @xmath2 multiplicity of the flow to @xmath6 .",
    "the radiative zone is at higher altitudes where @xmath7  g ; here the resonantly scattered photons escape and the outflow enters the radiative regime , losing its kinetic energy .",
    "the interaction of radiation and @xmath2 outflow was studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the outflow lorentz factor @xmath8 decreases proportionally to the local magnetic field , @xmath9 the average energy of resonantly scattered photons is given by @xmath10 equations  ( [ eq_gpm ] ) and ( [ eq_esc ] ) imply that the spectrum of escaping hard x - rays has an average photon index @xmath11 and its luminosity peaks at the high - energy end @xcite .",
    "the spectrum cuts off in the mev band , because the multi - mev photons are emitted in the adiabatic zone and can not escape .",
    "the predicted spectral shape , however , strongly depends on the viewing angle , and may significantly differ from the average spectrum .    for a given position of the observer and location of the active magnetic loop the model predicts a well - defined phase - dependent radiation spectrum that can be quantitatively compared with observations .",
    "the spectrum can be calculated using the monte - carlo technique as described in @xcite .",
    "we have developed a different , independent code that performs a similar calculation using direct integration of the angle - dependent emissivity over the j - bundle .",
    "this method does not include photon splitting , which is important at high energies .",
    "we have tested the code against the monte - carlo results presented in @xcite and found excellent agreement at photon energies below 400  kev .    in this paper , we assume that the magnetosphere is axisymmetric and close to the dipole configuration in the region of interest ( where @xmath12 g ) .",
    "the dipole moment of the neutron star @xmath13 is provided by measurements of its spindown rate ; it is taken from @xcite for 4u  0142 + 61 , and from @xcite for 1rxs  j17084009  and 1e  1841045 .",
    "we also assume that the active , current - carrying region of the magnetosphere ( `` j - bundle '' ) , which is filled with the @xmath2 flow , is axisymmetric .",
    "then the model is completely defined by four remaining parameters :    * @xmath14 , the half opening angle ( from the magnetic axis ) of the j - bundle footprint on the star .",
    "* @xmath15 , the bolometric luminosity radiated by the j - bundle . *",
    "@xmath16 , the angle between the rotation axis and magnetic axis of the neutron star .",
    "* @xmath17 , the angle between the rotation axis and the observer line of sight .",
    "in addition , the point of zero rotational phase must be kept as a free parameter to fit phase - resolved data .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 is related to two theoretical quantities  the discharge voltage @xmath18 and the twist angle of the magnetic field lines @xmath19 ( beloborodov 2009 ) , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the radius of the neutron star , which we fix at 10  km . a twist angle @xmath22",
    "is expected for a strongly twisted magnetosphere ; measured values of @xmath15 and @xmath23 can provide an order - of - magnitude for the discharge voltage @xmath18 .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "remarkably , the coronal outflow model fits the data in a small region of the parameter space , which allowed us to derive significant constraints on the active bundle of magnetic field lines ( j - bundle ) .",
    "in particular , for 4u  0142 + 61  and 1rxs  j17084009   the opening angle of the j - bundle @xmath24 , and its total luminosity ( most of which is emitted in the mev band , outside the observed spectral range ) is @xmath25  erg  s@xmath26 .",
    "both parameters are in line with theoretical expectations @xcite . using equation",
    "( 3 ) one can estimate the product of the twist angle @xmath19 and the discharge voltage @xmath18 in the j - bundle .",
    "we found @xmath27  v , consistent with @xmath28  v. is expected for an active magnetar .",
    "the growth of @xmath19 beyond a critical value @xmath29 is prohibited by a global instability  the over - twisted magnetopshere inflates , forms an unstable current sheet , and ejects magnetic plasmoids , reducing the twist energy @xcite . ]",
    "this voltage is higher ( at least by a factor of a few ) compared with theoretical estimates of @xcite or the voltage inferred from the outburst decay in xte  j1810@xmath30197 @xcite .",
    "the j - bundle parameters obtained for 4u  0142 + 61  and 1rxs  j17084009  are comparable , which may be expected , as their spectra are similar .",
    "the spectrum of 1e  1841045  is significantly different : the spectral index of its hard x - ray component is larger and the dip between the soft and hard components is smaller . we find that this difference is mainly explained by different angles @xmath16 and @xmath17 ; the parameters of the j - bundle itself ( @xmath15 and @xmath23 ) are comparable for all three objects . the fact that two out of three magnetars appear to have a small angle between the magnetic and rotation axes @xmath31 suggests that rotation plays a role in shaping the magnetic moment of the neutron star .",
    "future measurements of phase - resolved spectra for other magnetars will allow one to better study the statistics of @xmath16 .",
    "independent constraints on @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be provided by measurements of x - ray polarization by future missions ( such as astro - h , @xcite ) .",
    "the analysis of the hard x - ray component gives the magnetic flux in the j - bundle from which one can estimate its footprint area @xmath32 .",
    "the exact area and location of the footprint depend on details of the magnetic field near the star ; a rough estimate for @xmath32 may be obtained assuming a dipole field . a hot spot with area @xmath33",
    "may be expected on the star .",
    "the obtained fits of the soft x - ray component are indeed consistent with the presence of a hot spot and give an independent estimate for its area @xmath34 . in 1rxs",
    "j17084009  and 1e  1841045 , @xmath34 is consistent with @xmath32 , providing further support to our model . for 4u  0142 + 61  we found @xmath35 , suggesting a hot spot extending around the j - bundle footprint or indicating that the centered dipole configuration is a poor approximation to the magnetosphere near the star .    instead of studying the phase - resolved spectra in three phase bins",
    ", one could use coarse spectral binning and analyze more detailed pulse profiles .",
    "we did not attempt to fit the detailed pulse profiles , because they are significantly affected by moderate deviations from axisymmetry . relaxing the axisymmetric assumption",
    "would make the model more flexible and difficult to describe using a small number of parameters .",
    "this would require a different , more complicated fitting procedure .",
    "note also that the pulsed fractions of the three magnetars are moderate even at high energies , in the range of 30 - 40% at @xmath36 kev ( w. hermsen , private communication ) .",
    "this is consistent with approximate axisymmetry of the j - bundle , explaining why our simple model gives reasonable fits to the phase - resolved spectra in wide phase bins .",
    "the coronal outflow model predicts that most of the luminosity is emitted in the mev band .",
    "future detectors with sensitivity better than that of comptel would help to better constrain the location of the j - bundle and the angle between the magnetic and rotation axes ."
