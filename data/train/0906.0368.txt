    "cosmological observations reveal that the mass content of the universe is mostly composed of dark matter of unknown , but non - baryonic nature .",
    "new physics models , such as supersymmetry ( susy ) , provide stable particle candidates for dark matter , and one can compute their present energy density , the relic density @xcite . this relic density is often compared to the dark matter density deduced from cosmological observations in order to constrain new physics parameters ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the usual assumption in doing that is that the universe is ruled by the standard model of cosmology , which assumes that radiation energy density and radiation entropy density dominate the universe properties in the very early universe .",
    "however , before big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) many phenomena could have modified the physical properties of the universe , such as the expansion rate , or the entropy evolution , or even the non - thermal production of relic particles .",
    "the calculation of the relic density is altered in these cases , and for example the influence of a quintessence - like scalar field @xcite , or reheating and non thermal production of relic particles due to the decay of an inflaton - like scalar field @xcite have been discussed in the literature .",
    "scenarios involving dark fluids or extra - dimensions modifying the expansion rate of the universe have been also considered in @xcite . on the other hand , with the start - up of the lhc",
    ", we can hope for new information on the physics beyond the standard model , providing more hints for the determination of the nature of dark matter @xcite .    in this paper , we consider the calculation of the relic density beyond the cosmological standard model and propose a generalized parametrization of the modification of the entropy evolution in the early universe .",
    "effects of the modification of the expansion rate was studied in @xcite , and we derive here the necessary equations to compute the relic density in a more generic way .",
    "we also discuss the importance of the lhc data in the context of cosmology and claim that future discoveries of the lhc can lead to a better understanding of the universe properties before bbn .    to illustrate the consequences of modifications of the cosmological model on the calculation of the relic density we consider in the following the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) with @xmath3-parity conservation and show the implications on the susy parameter interpretation and constraints .",
    "the density number of supersymmetric particles is determined by the boltzmann equation , which in presence of non - thermal production of relic particles takes the form : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the number density of supersymmetric particles , @xmath6 is the thermally averaged annihilation cross - section , @xmath7 is the hubble expansion rate and @xmath8 is the supersymmetric particle equilibrium number density .",
    "the term @xmath9 provides a parametrization of the non - thermal production of susy particles which is in general temperature - dependent .",
    "the expansion rate @xmath7 is determined by the friedmann equation : @xmath10 @xmath11 is the radiation energy density , which is considered to be dominant before bbn in the standard cosmological model . following @xcite , we introduced in eq .",
    "( [ friedmann ] ) @xmath12 to parametrize the expansion rate modification .",
    "@xmath12 can be interpreted either as an additional energy density term modifying the expansion ( _ e.g. _ quintessence ) , or as an effective energy density which can account for other phenomena affecting the expansion rate ( _ e.g. _ extra - dimensions ) .",
    "the entropy evolution can also be altered beyond the standard cosmological model , and we write the entropy evolution equation in presence of entropy fluctuations : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the total entropy density . @xmath15 in the above equation parametrizes effective entropy fluctuations due to unknown properties of the early universe , and is temperature - dependent .    in the following , for the sake of generality ,",
    "the three new parameters @xmath9 , @xmath12 and @xmath15 are regarded as independent .",
    "entropy and energy alterations are considered here as effective effects , which can be generated by curvature , phase transitions , extra - dimensions , or other phenomena in the early universe . in a specific physical scenario , these parameters may be related , as for example in reheating models @xcite .",
    "however , the large number of unanswered questions in the pre - bbn epoch and the complexity of particle physics models , which involves many different fields , can doubt the simplicity of reheating models . in particular many open questions remain in inflation , leptogenesis and baryogenesis scenarios .",
    "therefore , a complete and realistic description of the early universe would rely on several different fields with complementary roles , far beyond the decaying scalar field description of inflation and reheating models , and the direct dependence between energy and entropy would in such cases be very difficult to determine at the time of the relic freeze - out .",
    "for this reason , we prefer to adopt a more conservative and effective approach in which the effective energy and entropy densities are considered as independent .    the radiation energy and entropy densities can be written as usual : @xmath16 we split the total entropy density into two parts : radiation entropy density and effective dark entropy density , @xmath17 . using eq .",

    "moreover , @xmath42 imposes @xmath43 for @xmath40 , strongly limiting the interest of negative @xmath38 as mentioned in @xcite .    to model the entropy perturbations , we choose to parametrize @xmath18 in a similar way instead of @xmath18 . ] : @xmath44 this parametrization finds its roots in the first law of thermodynamics , where energy and entropy are directly related and therefore the entropy parametrization can be similar to the energy parametrization . as for the energy density , different values of @xmath45 lead to different behaviors of the entropy density : @xmath46 corresponds to a radiation behavior , @xmath47 appears in dark energy models , @xmath48 in reheating models , and other values can be generated by curvature , scalar fields or extra - dimension effects .",
    "@xmath49 is the ratio of the effective entropy density to the radiation entropy density at bbn time and can be negative .",
    "the role of @xmath18 will be to increase the temperature at which the radiation dominates for @xmath50 , leading to a decreased relic density , or to decrease this temperature for @xmath51 , leading to an increased relic density .",

    "in the second plot , generated in a universe with an additional energy density with @xmath87 and @xmath36 , the relic density favored strips are reduced , as already shown also in @xcite , because the calculated relic densities are decreased in comparison to the relic densities computed in the standard scenario .",
    "the next plots demonstrate the influence of an additional entropy density compatible with bbn constraints .",
    "the favored strips are this time enlarged and moved towards the outside of the plot .",
    "this effect is due to a decrease in the relic density .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we consider two cosmological scenarios in which both energy and entropy densities are present . the energy and entropy densities have opposite effects and can compensate , and the similarity of the plots reveals the degeneracy between the two cosmological scenarios from the point of view of particle physics .",
    "however , using the bbn constraints , the scenario of the right plot can be ruled out .",
    "an important consequence of this example is that if we discover that the particle physics scenario best in agreement with the lhc data ( or future colliders ) leads to a relic density in disagreement with the cosmological data constraints , useful information on the cosmological scenario may be deduced : first , it would imply that the cosmological standard model does not describe satisfyingly the pre - bbn universe .",
    "second , combining all cosmological data , and in particular those from bbn , it would be possible to determine physical properties of the early universe and constrain early universe scenarios . as such , valuable constraints on cosmological models can be obtained from particle colliders .",
    "it is important to point out that all the scenarios previously described ",
    "apart in the second plot of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ]  are equivalent from the point of view of the cosmological observations : there is no way to distinguish between them with the current cosmological data .",
    "in this paper , we have argued that the calculation of the relic density is very sensitive to the very early universe properties such as the energy or the entropy contents .",
    "for this reason , the interpretation of the relic density in the context of particle physics should be done very cautiously , as the favored parameter zones can be completely shifted in any direction by unobservable cosmological phenomena during the pre - bbn era . in @xcite",
    ", we already showed that the addition of energy density can falsify the use of the lower wmap limit . in this paper",
    "we demonstrated that the possible presence of additional entropy also strongly questions the use of the upper wmap bound .",
    "therefore we can conclude that using the wmap bounds to constrain susy is very model - dependent since the standard model of cosmology remains very uncertain and highly questionable before bbn . on the other hand ,",
    "we also notice here the importance of the discovery of new physics beyond the particle physics standard model : if the lhc data point to a new particle physics model providing a candidate for dark matter , combining relic density calculations with cosmological data will give constraints on the pre - bbn era and give valuable hints on the physics of the very early universe . to conclude , the relic density , even if not predictive for particle physics at the moment , will hopefully soon appear as a new tool to design more precise cosmological models and to analyze the nature of the dark components of the universe .",
