    "so , other sensitive tests should be found .",
    "the dynamics of minimally coupled scalar field dark energy at scales of gravitational bound systems is not studied so extensively as at cosmological scales mainly due to complexity of non - linear dynamics of dark matter and baryon components that needs the numerical n - body - hydro - thermodynamics simulations .",
    "the main features and characteristic times of dynamics of dark matter at the late stages of formation of gravitational bound systems are obtained from the analysis of spherical model which is generalized for @xmath8cdm - model and dark matter plus unclustered quintessence on scales much smaller than the horizon for different aspects of large scale structure formation @xcite . in the numerical n - body simulations of large scale structure formation ( see overviews @xcite and citing therein ) the dark energy is implemented also mainly for the computations of the correct hubble function @xmath9 and initial power spectrum of matter density perturbations @xmath10 for the specific model under investigation .",

    "<S> we analyse the evolution of scalar field dark energy in the spherical halos of dark matter at the late stages of formation of gravitationally bound systems in the expanding universe . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of quintessential dark energy at the center of dark matter halo strongly depends on the value of effective sound speed @xmath0 ( in units of speed of light ) . if @xmath1 ( classical scalar field ) then the dark energy in the gravitationally bound systems is only slightly perturbed and its density is practically the same as in cosmological background . </S>",
    "<S> the dark energy with small value of sound speed ( @xmath2 ) , on the contrary , is important dynamical component of halo at all stages of their evolution : linear , non - linear , turnaround , collapse , virialization and later up to current epoch . </S>",
    "<S> these properties of dark energy can be used for constraining the value of effective sound speed @xmath0 by comparison the theoretical predictions with observational data related to the large scale gravitationally bound systems . </S>"
