    "multiferroics have been one of the most intensively studied materials during the past decade @xcite .",
    "the coexistence of more than one order parameter in a single phase and their coupling may open new routes to the next generation of electronic devices .",
    "for instance , the possibility of controlling magnetization via external electric fields may find promising applications in spintronics .",
    "the origin of magnetoelectric multiferroicity lies in a nonzero magnetoelectric coupling which may occur due to many different mechanisms ( for recent reviews , see @xcite ) .",
    "the magnetic properties of an intrinsic bulk magnetoelectric , of which cr@xmath4o@xmath0 is a prototype , can be modulated by an external field through the change of the magnetic cations displacement relative to anions @xcite .",
    "extrinsic magnetoelectric couplings are typically mediated by strain : in composites of piezomagnetic materials combined with electrostrictive materials , external fields modulate the electric polarization , as well as the shape of the piezoelectric .",
    "this change in turn induces strain of the magnetic components and modifies the magnetization in the magnetostrictive material @xcite .",
    "however , although these bulk mechanisms are well understood , the magnitude of magnetoelectric couplings in bulk materials is generally small  @xcite , impeding their applications in electronic devices .",
    "moving away from bulk materials , artificial heterostructures such as interfaces are promising candidates for realizing or even engineering magnetoelectric couplings .",
    "recently , a variety of mechanisms were proposed to induce magnetoelectric coupling at interfaces . at ferromagnet",
    "/ ferroelectric interfaces , the interfacial bond length can be altered by the presence of ferroelectric polarization , for example in fe / batio@xmath0 @xcite , co@xmath4mnsi / batio@xmath0 @xcite and fe@xmath0o@xmath5/batio@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "another mechanism is to apply an external field and induce magnetization mediated by free screening carriers accumulated at ferromagnetic / dielectric interfaces , for example srruo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "a more complex but intriguing mechanism was recently described theoretically and experimentally @xcite at ferroelectric / conducting magnetic manganite interfaces .",
    "our work focuses on this last class of systems , because the coupling between ferroelectric polarization and magnetization not only is of great importance in fundemental sciences , but also finds very promising applications in memory devices  @xcite .    at a ferroelectric / manganite interface ,",
    "the presence of the ferroelectric polarization causes screening charges to appear at the interface due to accumulation or depletion of carriers in the interfacial region .",
    "much like srruo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 interfaces , the magnetization of the interfacial atoms can be enhanced due to the modification of carrier density around the interface because the magnetic moment of the atoms depends on the doping level ( provided that the manganite is in the ferromagnetic phase ) .",
    "what is different in the ferroelectric / manganite system is that the accumulation of carriers not only changes the magnetic moment but can lead to an interfacial ferromagnetic - to - antiferromagnetic transition which reverses the directions of the moments and thus to a much larger magnetoelectric coupling .",
    "the work of ref .",
    "@xcite studied a representative heterostructure : batio@xmath0/la@xmath1ba@xmath6mno@xmath0 with @xmath7 . for bulk",
    "la@xmath1sr@xmath2mno@xmath0 , @xmath7 is at the critical doping level separating ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases , so the system is highly susceptible to magnetic changes with small changes of doping .",
    "what was found is that when the ferroelectric polarization is flipped , the magnetic moment of the mn atoms in the second unit cell away from the interface is reversed .",
    "we note that the result is somewhat unintuitive as the carrier doping density is highest in the first layer at the interface which is most susceptible to change of magnetic phase",
    ". experiments on the pb(ti@xmath8zr@xmath9)o@xmath0/la@xmath1sr@xmath2mno@xmath0   are performed for @xmath10  @xcite which is quite far from the boundary : _ a priori _ it is not clear whether enough screening charges can accumulate to drive the system over the magnetic phase transition . the experiments find a large magneto - electric coupling which is interpreted to originate from a spin - flip in the first unit cell of the manganite closest to the interface  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we comprehensively study this proposed magnetoelectric phenomenon at the ferroelectric / manganite interface using first - principles calculations .",
    "we choose pbtio@xmath0/la@xmath1sr@xmath6mno@xmath0 as our prototype for computational convenience .",
    "although the experiments use pb(ti@xmath8zr@xmath9)o@xmath0 as the ferroelectric @xcite in order to reduce leakage currents , the key role of the ferroelectric is to induce screening charges due to its surface polarization , and we believe the compositional details are secondary . for the la@xmath1sr@xmath2mno@xmath0  thin film , we choose the nominal hole doping to be @xmath10 ( unless otherwise specified ) in order to directly compare to experiment @xcite .",
    "the original contributions of this paper are the following .",
    "( i ) we are able to show that even though the manganite film has a low nominal doping of @xmath10 , the ferroelectric field effects can sufficiently change the carrier density to induce a magnetic transition at the interface . however , the precise ground - state magnetic structure of the interface ( e.g. , no spin - flip , spin - flip in first mn layer , spin - flip in second mn layer ) depends sensitively on the choice of exchange correlation functionals and specifically the value of the hubbard @xmath3 parameter in the dft+@xmath3 approach .",
    "( ii ) we clarify the physical reasons of the sensitivity based on a simple ising - like nearest - neighbor model using bulk - derived parameters that well describes the computed dependences .",
    "( iii ) we describe an unexpected purely interfacial effect that significantly modifies the energies of magnetic states at the interface : the ferroelectric polarization propagates into the first few manganite layers and the resulting rumplings of atomic layers are responsible for the modifications .",
    "this degree of freedom is not present in the bulk and potentially represents a further degree of freedom that can be exploited to modify and engineer material properties at oxide interfaces .",
    "( iv ) we show that various approaches to find an appropriate @xmath3 produce significantly different @xmath3 values , some of which do poorly when used to compute results that compare to bulk properties of manganites ; empiricism in the choice of @xmath3 is an unfortunate necessity for manganites using state - of - the - art _ ab initio _ methods .",
    "( v ) in the process of this work , we develop an alternative method for counting electrons on the mn atoms in la@xmath1sr@xmath2mno@xmath0  thin films that is directly based on the electron density instead of the standard and widely used method based on projecting onto lwdin or atomic - like orbitals  @xcite . with this method",
    ", we can quantify the carrier distribution as a function of ferroelectric polarization and calculate the layer - resolved effective hole doping .",
    "the method is generally applicable to half - metallic oxide films .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we discuss computational details in section  [ computation ] .",

    "inclusion of srtio@xmath0 substrate in the simulation of pbtio@xmath0/la@xmath1sr@xmath2mno@xmath0   heterostructures is computationally intensive . in this section , we test the effects of srtio@xmath0 substrate on structrual and magnetic properties on the pbtio@xmath0/la@xmath1sr@xmath2mno@xmath0  interface .",
    "we compare two calculations : one with three unit cells of srtio@xmath0 and the other without srtio@xmath0 .",
    "la@xmath1sr@xmath2mno@xmath0  is four unit cells thick with nominal doping @xmath10 .",
    "pbtio@xmath0 thin film is polarized so that both calculations are in the accumulation state . in terms of structural properties , we focus on two important quantities .",
    "one is the @xmath11 ratio of each oxygen octahedron that encloses mn atoms .",

    "layer 4 is the artificial surface when srtio@xmath0 is absent .",
    "the solid symbols are with srtio@xmath0 and the open symbols are without srtio@xmath0 .",
    "we can see that the structural properties with or without srtio@xmath0 substrate quickly converge as the interface is approached . at layer 1 ,",

    "[ fig : sto_effect]b shows the comparison between with srtio@xmath0 substrate ( solid symbols ) and without srtio@xmath0 substrate ( open symbols ) .",
    "similar to structural properties , the effects of srtio@xmath0 substrate on magnetic properties are generally very small and diminish at the interface .",
    "therefore we do not include srtio@xmath0 substrate in our simulation , not only to reduce the computation burden but also to introduce an artificial surface so that we can apply a counting method ( see appendix  [ count ] ) to accurately calculate hole distribution in la@xmath1sr@xmath2mno@xmath0 .",

    "the spin polarized part is la@xmath1sr@xmath2mno@xmath0 .",
    "the green dashed lines highlight the computed boundaries of each layer.,width=453 ]    a widely used approach for calculating the number of holes and the magnetization of mn atoms is to use lwdin orbitals  @xcite . however , a more direct method is to use the electron density itself .",
    "the difficulty lies in that the boundary between each manganite layer is not well - defined in the thin film of la@xmath1sr@xmath2mno@xmath0 .",
    "we develop a method to self - consistently set the boundary between each manganite layer , provided that the manganite is half - metallic .    for a half - metallic manganite , there are no states at the fermi level in the minority spin channel , so that there must be a definite integer number of electrons @xmath14 filled in the minority spin channel .",
    "@xmath14 depends on the details of pseudopotentials . for our pseudo atoms ( see table [ tab : psp ] ) , for doping level @xmath15 , we have la@xmath16 : @xmath17 , sr@xmath18 : @xmath19 , o@xmath20 : @xmath21 and due to charge conservation , mn ion is nominally @xmath22 with an electron configuration @xmath23 . for one unit cell of la@xmath1sr@xmath2mno@xmath0 , since spin polarization only comes from the electrons on mn @xmath13-orbitals , we can sum all the other electrons that are formally spin unpolarized : @xmath24 .",
    "the four terms are from la@xmath16 , sr@xmath18 , three o@xmath20 and the mn ion without @xmath13-electrons .",
    "hence @xmath25 , which is independent of hole doping .",
    "now we start from the vacuum ( see fig . [",
    "fig : charge_profile ] ) where there is no charge .",
    "we integrate the minority spin channel moving into the film until the integral is equal to 20 .",
    "then this position determines the boundary of the first layer .",
    "next we restart the integral from this boundary until it reaches 20 again .",
    "this determines the boundary of the second layer . repeating the procedure yields the boundaries of each manganite layer .",
    "once the boundaries are determined , we integrate the charge density of both majority and minority spins in each layer and thus layer - resolved holes and magntization follow straightforwardly .",
    "we comment that in dft calculations , as long as the hubbard @xmath3 is larger than a critical value @xmath26 , the manganites become half - metallic in the ferromagnetic phase . for srtio@xmath0-strained @xmath27 la@xmath1sr@xmath2mno@xmath0 , we find @xmath28 ev . therefore , for the useful and reasonable range of @xmath3 , our method is valid .",

    "our result is consistent with previous calculations  @xcite .",
    "due to the well known underestimation of band gaps in dft calculations , band alignment errors and possible artificial charge spillage into the conduction bands of on material at an interface may occur .",
