    "given the overlap between the @xmath0sct  and @xmath1dor   instability strips , a search for hybrid pulsators began in the last few years , which was driven by the fact that p - modes are sensitive to the envelope , whereas g - modes are sensitive to the core .",

    "we corrected for the blaze function of orders containing the hydrogen lines by using the artificial flat - fielding technique described , e.g. , by @xcite .",
    "this approach assumes that the blaze shape of the different chelle orders change smoothly with the order number and one can reconstruct missing blaze shapes by fitting polynomials to continuum points identified in several adjacent orders blue- and redwards of the hydrogen line containing order .",
    "a 2-d polynomial surface is fitted to these empirical blaze functions and the blaze in the orders containing the hydrogen lines is determined by interpolation .",
    "the accuracy of this technique is confirmed by an excellent agreement of the normalized hydrogen lines obtained with sophie and harps spectrographs ( see fig.[fig - hda - hbetafit ] ) having a clearly different blaze characteristic and different position of the hydrogen lines within the orders .",
    "the @xmath5  of the two stars ( @xmath870 and 40@xmath6 ) makes the continuum normalization a critical step of the reduction procedure .",
    "we normalized the combined , blaze removed orders without the use of any automatic continuum fitting procedure and by comparing with suited synthetic spectra . for wavelengths shorter than the h@xmath9  line it was not possible to determine the correct level of the continuum , as there were not enough continuum windows in the spectrum at these wavelengths due to the strong line blending .",

    "<S> @xmath0sct  - @xmath1dor  hybrids pulsate simultaneously in p- and g - modes , which carry information on the structure of the envelope as well as to the core . </S>",

    "<S> we obtained high - resolution spectra of hd114839  and bd+184914  using the sophie spectrograph of the observatoire de haute - provence and the harps spectrograph at eso lasilla . for each star we determined fundamental parameters and photospheric abundances of 16 chemical elements by comparing synthetic spectra with the observations . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our results to that of seven @xmath0sct  and nine @xmath1dor  stars . for the evolved bd+184914  we found an abundance pattern typical for an am star , but could not confirm this peculiarity for the less evolved star hd114839 , </S>",
