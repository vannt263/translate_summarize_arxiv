    "ultra - diffuse galaxies ( udgs ) are a class of spatially - extended , low surface brightness galaxy . to understand their physical nature and study them in the context of their environment ,",
    "we require accurate distance measurements .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts have been measured for 4 galaxies categorized as udgs since the renewed interest in extreme low surface brightness galaxies in 2015 . of the population discovered in proximity to the coma cluster ,",
    "df44 ( @xmath4 @xmath5 ; @xmath6 @xmath7 ) is the only udg spectroscopically confirmed as a coma member @xcite .",
    "likewise , a spectroscopic redshift measurement places vcc 1287 ( @xmath4 @xmath8 ; @xmath6 @xmath9 ) in the virgo cluster @xcite and dgsat i ( @xmath4 @xmath10 ; @xmath6 @xmath11 ) in a low density filament of the pisces - perseus supercluster @xcite , identifies ugc 2162 as the nearest udg @xcite .",
    "while df44 and vcc 1287 are projected near their associated galaxy clusters , other apparent close associations can be misleading , as demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "all coordinates listed in this paper are given in j2000 .",
    "in addition to providing the critical distance measurement , spectra provide information on the current stellar populations and star formation history of these galaxies .",
    "for example , @xcite noted that the spectrum of df44 is similar to that of early - type galaxies , with balmer and g - band absorption lines , concluding that df44 is a quiescent galaxy with no significant on - going or recent star formation .",
    "such findings inform the development of models for the origin and evolution of these systems .",
    "we aim to determine if there does exist a class of physically extended udgs , like df44 , in significant numbers in the cluster environment and if these galaxies are exclusively quiescent , old galaxies . in  [ data ] we describe the observations and data analysis . in  [ results ] we present the redshift measurements and interpret the spectra . throughout",
    "we adopt a standard @xmath12cdm cosmology with @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "we selected udgs to observe from the @xcite sample of 47 candidates projected near the coma cluster .",
    "in particular , we selected luminous ( @xmath16 mag ) and large udgs ( with projected half light radii , @xmath17 , larger than 2.9 kpc assuming the udg is in coma ) to focus on those analogous to df44",
    ". only 18 udgs from the parent sample satisfy both the size and luminosity criteria . finally , we had to require that potential targets have a nearby guide star brighter than @xmath18 that is suitably located for the guide probe .",
    "our final sample contained 10 candidate targets , of which we observed six .",
    "we list the observed udgs and relevant parameters in table [ table : udg_target ] .    on 2016",
    "march 9 and 10 we observed in mostly clear conditions using the multi - object double spectrograph ( mods ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the large binocular telescope ( lbt ) prior to the binocular mode being operational .",
    "because udgs have relatively flat surface brightness profiles , we opted to use a wide slit to increase the amount of light collected , at the expense of spectral resolution .",
    "we used a custom 2.4-wide slit , twice as wide as the largest previously available long slit .",
    "we observed each target for 60 to 90 minutes , combining multiple 30 minute dithered exposures , simultaneously using the g400l grating ( 400 lines mm@xmath19 blazed at @xmath20 centered on 4000   with a resolution of 1850 ) in the blue channel ( 3200 - 5800  ) and the g670l grating ( 250 lines mm@xmath19 blazed at @xmath21 centered on 7600   with a resolution of 2300 ) in the red channel ( 5800 - 10000  ) .",
    "we do not use the red channel data due to higher sky brightness .",
    "we reduced the spectra using the mods data reduction pipeline @xcite .",
    "reduction includes the standard steps of overscan correction , 2d bias subtraction , dark current subtraction , flat fielding , wavelength calibration , sky subtraction , flux calibration , and extraction . because we use the mods long - slit , over 80% of the slit",
    "is clear sky , allowing for high s / n sky subtraction using the two - dimensional fitting available in the standard pipeline .",
    "our final spectra have a s / n in the continuum ranging from 3 to 8 per pixel .",
    "these are therefore fairly low s / n spectra .",
    "we obtained these redshift - quality spectra for six targets , but exclude df17 from further discussion because ultimately we were unable to measure a redshift .",

    "we now describe our measurement of the individual recessional velocities of the udgs and examine the nature of the spectra , both in terms of the individual spectra and a combined stack .",
    "we confine our discussion to the blue channel spectra ( figure [ fig : udg_spectra ] ) .",
    "the most prominent absorption features in the udg spectra are the balmer absorption lines , the ca ii h & k lines just blueward of restframe 4000  and the g - band at about 4300  .",
    "these features are also prominent in the published spectrum of df44 @xcite .",
    "we measure redshifts and uncertainties by cross - correlating the udg spectra against spectral templates .",
    "the ubiquity of balmer lines suggests that an a - type stellar spectrum would be an ideal template , although the ca lines and g - band suggest that later type stars might also be suitable . as such",
    ", we use both , but generally find more significant results using the a - type template , with velocities differing by no more than 60 km s@xmath19 between templates in most cases , with one exception at 120 km s@xmath19 .",
    "we use the iraf task xcsao for the cross - correlation analysis .",
    "we vary parameters , including the high and low frequency cutoffs , while searching velocities between @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) for the correlation function maximum .",
    "we only accept velocities that are robust to changes in the input parameters and then visually confirm that multiple absorption lines correspond to the principal absorption features that we mention above .",
    "we extract high confidence redshifts from the spectra of 5 out of the 6 observed udgs . for the sixth",
    ", we do not even extract a low confidence redshift estimate .    because of heliocentric velocity corrections , differences in slit illumination , and wavelength calibration errors , it is possible for template stars to have effective reference velocities that differ by several tens of km s@xmath19 from the published values .",
    "such uncertainties are irrelevant when determining whether galaxies lie within the coma cluster , but the surprising availability of emission lines in one of our spectra allows us to correct the velocity zero point and also provides a test of the absorption line cross - correlation procedure .",
    "we will discuss this interesting object further below .",
    "we compare emission and absorption redshifts for df08 to estimate the external uncertainties of the stellar cross correlation analysis .",
    "we find an offset of 220 km s@xmath19 between the recessional velocities measured from cross - correlation with spectral templates and from the shift in [ oii ] and [ oiii ] lines with restframe wavelengths in air of 3726.05 , 3728.80 , 4958.92 , 5006.85   ( about 2@xmath64 discrepant given the internal error estimate ) .",
    "differences among the cross - correlation results using different templates for all of our udgs are @xmath65 120 km s@xmath19 .",
    "we conclude that even if our uncertainties are truly as large as 200 km s@xmath19 , our conclusions regarding membership in coma for these udg candidates is unchanged .",
    "we convert the spectra of the five udgs from observed to rest frame , subtract the continua , and display them in figure [ fig : udg_spectra ] . the best - fit udg recessional velocities and uncertainties",
    "are listed in table [ table : udg_target ] .        to determine coma cluster membership , we place the udgs on the cluster phase - space diagram , which we construct using measurements of galaxies retrieved from the nasa extragalactic database ( figure [ fig : phase_space ] ) .",
    "there are enough known coma members that they clearly delineate the classic wedge distribution defined by the caustic curves .",
    "four of our udgs ( df07 , df08 , df30 , and df40 ) , plus the previously measured df44 , fall within the caustics and we conclude these are bona fide members .",
    "another of our udgs ( df03 ) lies well outside the caustic curves and we conclude that this system is 45 mpc behind the cluster . from the statistics that 5 out of the 6 udgs with measured redshifts lie within coma and restricting ourselves to systems that satisfy our selection criteria , we conclude that of the 18 @xcite systems that satisfy our size and magnitude criteria , @xmath66 are likely to be coma cluster members . we conclude that there is a significant population of physically large cluster udgs .",
    "we do not interpret the phase - space diagram further because the radial selection effects in the original catalog are likely to be significant .",
    "the presence of balmer lines in galaxy spectra is often interpreted as evidence for intermediate age ( 1 gyr ) populations , but can also be the result of low metallicity .",
    "we suspect the latter is the case in these galaxies given their red colors as a population @xcite . to explore this issue",
    "further , we combine the spectra to produce a higher signal - to - noise spectrum ( figure [ fig : stacked_metallicity ] ) , but caution that this approach caries a risk that we are combining systems with different properties .",
    "we use the pgase stellar population modeling software @xcite to create comparison spectra for single age ( 13 gyr ) populations with three different metallicities ( figure [ fig : stacked_metallicity ] ) .",
    "we visually place the stacked spectrum in the abundance sequence .",
    "in particular , we focus on the strength of the h@xmath67 line and the ratio of the h@xmath68 line to the g - band , which lies just to the blue of h@xmath68 .",
    "this analysis is clearly a preliminary determination of the typical metallicity of such udgs , and a composite one at that , but the indications are that these are quite metal poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath3 ) .    for comparison",
    ", we also identify the optimal match for a young , 1 gyr , population in figure [ fig : stacked_metallicity ] .",
    "we prefer the models with old , metal poor populations for several reasons .",
    "first , the spectrum of the young population matches h@xmath69 and h@xmath70g - band , but results in an h & k break that is too strong , as seen by the peak at around 4000 , and a mg and fe complex at about 5200  that is not in the observed spectra .",
    "second , the low metallicity estimate for these galaxies agrees with a simple expectation from the metallicity - luminosity relation ( * ? ? ? * ( zkh ) ) .",
    "for early type galaxies , @xmath71 is roughly @xmath72 @xcite , which places our typical udg with @xmath73 at @xmath74 and at about an [ fe / h ] of @xmath75 in the relationships plotted in figure 13 of zkh .",
    "finally , independent measurements of the metallicity in similar galaxies has also concluded that these systems are of low metalliity @xcite .",
    "we conclude , based on the low metallicites , that these udgs are not the tidal remnants of much larger galaxies .      while absorption features are common in previously observed udg spectra @xcite , emission lines have been found only in one gas rich udg @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , we have a weak detection of oxygen in one of the coma udgs in our sample . in figure",
    "[ fig : oii_oiii ] we show a spectrum of df08 , which features weak [ oii ] and [ oiii ] emission lines at a redshift consistent with the absorption line redshift .",
    "the existence of these lines indicates that df08 is not entirely gas - depleted nor devoid of ionizing sources .",
    "we are unable to localize a specific source in the 2d spectrum , so we conclude that the emission is somewhat physically extended .",
    "emission lines may become a more common signature of udgs as field samples are explored @xcite and establishing the differences between field and cluster udg samples is a clear next step .",
    "we present spectroscopy of five udgs seen in projection on the coma cluster with the mods spectrograph on the lbt and reach the following conclusions .    * on the basis of their recessional velocities , we confirm 4 of our udgs to be coma cluster members , thereby quintupling the population of spectroscopically confirmed coma udgs .",
    "* on the basis of its recessional velocity , we place another of our udgs about 45 mpc behind the coma cluster . along with dgsat",
    "i , df03 is one of the few field udgs with a spectroscopic redshift . *",
    "coupled with the spectroscopic confirmation of df44 @xcite , the result that 5 of 6 spectroscopically observed , physically large ( projected half light radius @xmath0 2.9 kpc ) udgs from the @xcite catalog are bona fide cluster members suggests that @xmath66 of the 18 similarly large dragonfly udgs are coma members .",
    "* on the basis of a comparison between pgase stellar population synthesis models and our composite udg spectra , we conclude that , on average , these systems are metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath3 ) .",
    "these systems are consistent with the metallicity - luminosity relation and the result excludes the possibility that these systems are the relics of much more luminous galaxies .",
    "* we present the first cluster udg ( df08 ) spectrum with emission lines .",
    "this finding demonstrates that not all cluster udgs lack gas and sources of ionizing radiation .",
    "the authors thank barry rothberg , our lbt support astronomer , and olga kuhn who helped us to navigate through the mods data reduction pipeline and to acquire the necessary blue and red spectral flats for our custom slit .",
    "the lbt is an international collaboration among institutions in the united states , italy and germany .",
