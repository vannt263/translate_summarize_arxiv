    "<S> [ fig_s_rho ] inset ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have exponents @xmath99 and @xmath100 , which is similar to the results of conventional systems @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the exponent @xmath101 takes the upper limit of the restriction ( [ rest_mic ] ) with @xmath102 ; that is , the number of domains in the microscopic regime is maximized in the superfluid system . </S>",
    "<S> this anomalous behavior is in contrast to the behavior of the above - mentioned conventional systems , while the macroscopic regime shows the universal behavior of percolation criticality .    generally speaking , </S>",
    "<S> the dynamic scaling behavior in the microscopic regime of the domain - area distribution reflects the `` microscopic '' dynamics of domain walls in the system under consideration . </S>",
    "<S> an effective theory that describes the dynamics in our system is quantum hydrodynamics for multi - component superfluids . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting how the hydrodynamics are connected to the anomalous behavior of the microscopic regime in the quantum fluids . </S>",
    "<S> the anomaly is suggested to occur in the presence of circular vortex sheets described by the quantum hydrodynamics .    to provide quantitative evidence of the above suggestion </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce a hydrodynamic theory for a vortex sheet between two domains in a multi - component superfluid . </S>",
    "<S> consider a core - less vortex of circulation @xmath103 with the circulation quantum @xmath104 in the superfluid . </S>",
    "<S> the vortex core is occupied by a @xmath14-domain surrounded by a sufficiently large @xmath13-domain , where a vortex sheet is formed by the relative velocity between the domains . according to a theory of quantum fluid dynamics @xcite , such a state </S>",
    "<S> is stabilized by centrifugal force due to the rotational superflow by the formation of a circular vortex sheet ; however , a flat vortex sheet is dynamically unstable without external forces owing to kelvin  </S>",
    "<S> helmholtz instability @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the radius @xmath24 of the circular wall is estimated by the equation of pressure equilibrium @xmath105 with the tension coefficient @xmath106 of the wall and the hydrostatic pressure @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) along the wall in the @xmath78-domain .    </S>",
    "<S> the theory gives the dynamic - scaling law between @xmath109 and @xmath24 in the microscopic regime . </S>",
    "<S> the pressure @xmath110 in the bulk , where the superfluid is at rest , is the sum of @xmath107 and the hydrodynamic pressure @xmath111 ; @xmath112 . here , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the mass density and superfluid velocity along the domain wall in the @xmath78-domain , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 symmetry of the hamiltonian for the multi - component superfluid corresponds to @xmath115 . using this result and substituting @xmath116 and @xmath117 into eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ epre ] ) , we obtain the dynamic - scaling relation with @xmath118 : @xmath119 here , the value of @xmath120 characterizes a length scale related to the domain wall , and thus , it should be on the order of the wall thickness @xmath30 . in the above discussion </S>",
    "<S> , we neglected the existence of domains embedded inside the circular domain wall . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is straightforward to show the contribution from such domains is negligible @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a circular domain ( @xmath102 ) shrinks and finally collapses in bulk owing to dissipation or evaporation in the conventional coarsening systems . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , a circular domain with vortices ( @xmath121 ) is stable in the presence of rotational superflow . </S>",
    "<S> this is why the number of domains in the microscopic regime is statistically enhanced with the upper limit @xmath11 in the superfluid system .    </S>",
    "<S> the existence of the scaling law ( [ n_to_s ] ) is a direct evidence that the microscopic regime is described by the quantum hydrodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we examined this law for the numerical experiments of binary becs . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig_s_nv ] shows the dynamic scaling plot of the ensemble average of @xmath122 for domains with @xmath123 obtained numerically by integrating the superfluid velocity along domain walls . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling law ( [ n_to_s ] ) is observed after the power - law behavior is well - established in the microscopic regime . </S>",
    "<S> the upturn of the plot at @xmath124 reflects the core structure of a vortex whose radius is on the order @xmath30 , which was neglected in the derivation of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ n_to_s ] ) @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the above statistical discussion is meaningful when domains with vortices are dominant over vortex - free domains ( @xmath125 ) in the microscopic regime . </S>",
    "<S> the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_s_nv ] shows the plot of the probability @xmath126 in which a domain of @xmath127 has @xmath121 . </S>",
    "<S> the probability is negligible in the initial domain pattern because the bogoliubov modes excited by dynamic instability do not causes momentum exchange , leading to a relative flow between two superfluids @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , superflow is locally induced by complex motions of domain walls , and quantized vortices are nucleated owing to the kelvin  helmholtz instability . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the probability @xmath128 grows with time , becoming substantially large at a late stage , where almost domains in the microscopic regime contain vortices . </S>",
    "<S> this result clearly shows that the influence of superflow is essential to the understanding of later - stage dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the dynamic - scaling plot for circulation number @xmath109 yields a different scaling behavior with @xmath129 in the macroscopic regime . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that distribution of velocity or vorticity may obey a different scaling law or power law for length scales larger than the average distance @xmath1 between domain walls . </S>",
    "<S> this situation is similar to the hierarchy in quantum turbulence , where the kolmogorov or semi - classical power law is realized over length scales larger than the average distance between vortex lines and a different power law is expected for smaller length scales @xcite . in this sense , investigation into the aspects of turbulence is fruitful future work of our system .    to reinforce our hypothesis on phase ordering dynamics </S>",
    "<S> , the theory can be applied to different multi - component superfluids , where vortex sheets are stabilized . </S>",
    "<S> an important application is quasi - two - dimensional @xmath130he - a confined in a slab system , where chiral domain walls were recently visualized @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the order parameter is the vector field @xmath131 that represents the direction of orbital angular momentum of the cooper pair in the dipole - locked @xmath130he - a . a one - to - one correspondence exists between the @xmath131 field of @xmath130he - a and the ( pseudo-)spin field of spinor ( binary ) becs , according to the mermin  ho relation that represents vorticity distribution due to the vector - field texture @xcite . in this sense </S>",
    "<S> , these superfluid systems can show a similar effect even if the `` microscopic '' dynamics differs between the @xmath130he - a and spinor ( binary ) becs . by quenching the @xmath130he - a system to the superfluid phase from the normal fluid phase , </S>",
    "<S> domain growth should occur . </S>",
    "<S> then , the characteristic domain - area distribution , as is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_loglog ] , will be observed when the characteristic domain size is much larger than thickness of domain wall and much smaller than the system size .    </S>",
