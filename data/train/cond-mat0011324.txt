    "[ fig : result ] does not saturate : this is because the flex approximation does not reproduce the saturation of @xmath220 below @xmath217 , which is a significant future problem .",
    "one of the possible mechanism for it will be the precursor effect of superconductivity below @xmath217 @xcite .",
    "finally , we point out that @xmath2 begins to decrease on cooling below @xmath217 in under - doped high-@xmath3 cuprates , whereas it takes a saturate value at lower temperatures in x = cu[n(cn)@xmath1]cl @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have presented the theoretical study for the resistivity and the hall coefficient of the @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1x salts . reference @xcite point out some experimental evidences that there anomalous behaviors have close connection with the grows of the af fluctuations @xcite . according to our theory ,",
    "the hall coefficient follows the relation @xmath223 in nearly af fermi liquid state , which is consistent with the experiment under the constant volume condition @xcite .",
    "this anomaly of @xmath2 , which can not be reproduced by the rta , is found to come from the vc s for the current which is indispensable to satisfy the conserving laws .",
    "moreover , based on the kubo formula , we have derived the expression of the incoherent conductivity @xmath81 beyond the eliashberg s transport theory , and found that it give a qualitatively important contribution in @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1x and in high - t@xmath224 cuprates at higher temperatures , where @xmath83 is realized .",
    "it also give the appropriate temperature dependence of @xmath2 .",
    "we have calculated both @xmath4 and @xmath2 based on the flex approximation for @xmath225 , without assuming any fitting parameters .",
    "the obtained @xmath38-dependences for @xmath4 , @xmath2 and cot@xmath147 explain well the experimentally observed pressure dependences . in conclusion , many essential electronic properties of @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1x , expecially both the anomalies of transport phenomena and the phase diagram , are explained well from the standpoint of the nearly af fermi liquid state .",
    "we stress that further observations under the constant volume condition are highly demanded for organic metals to make a meaningful comparison between theory .",

    "we find that ( i ) @xmath231 because of the vc s for the current , and ( ii ) @xmath232 because of @xmath81 , which becomes dominant especially at higher temperatures . as a result , @xmath233 is realized at higher temperatures .    as for hall effect , @xmath234 and @xmath235 , respectively .",
    "we see that @xmath236 because @xmath232 .",
    "however , @xmath237 is larger than that of @xmath238 , so the incoherent conductivity make the temperature dependence of @xmath2 larger .",
    "we stress that @xmath239 become positive at higher temperature , which contradicts with experiments @xcite . in conclusion , we find that @xmath81 is necessary to reproduce the reasonable behavior of @xmath2 .",
    "in real @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1x systems , there are two pairs of closely - packed bedt - ttf molecules in a unit call , and only the bonding - orbit of each closely - packed molecules contributes to make the fermi surface . by taking the results of the band - calculations into account , we get the effective tight - binding model for @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1x as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : titebinding ] , where there are two sites ( a , b ) in a unit cell .",
