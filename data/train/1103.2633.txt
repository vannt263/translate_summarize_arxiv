    "measurements of quantized vortices and attempts to develop methods for the visualization of different vortex configurations has been central in superfluid studies .",
    "recent interest has focused on quantum turbulence , especially in the zero - temperature limit @xcite . in bose - einstein - condensed atom clouds motion of vortices",
    "has been recently investigated with optical means @xcite . in the long - studied case of superfluid @xmath4he",
    ", vortices can be detected , e.g. , by ion trapping on vortex cores or second sound attenuation @xcite , while recent work on turbulence studies has been making use of transmission measurements of charged vortex rings @xcite or trapping of micron - sized tracer particles in vortex tangles @xcite , as well as by analyzing the drag force exerted on vibrating structures @xcite . in superfluid",
    "@xmath0he the traditional method to study vortices is nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite .",
    "the superfluid flow due to quantized vortices modifies the order parameter field and thus , the nmr signal . in uniform rotation a resolution of a single vortex can be obtained @xcite in a measurement of the counterflow velocity at temperatures @xmath5 . at very low temperatures , in the limit @xmath6 ,",
    "the most powerful tool is the andreev scattering of thermal excitations",
    ". this technique has been developed and exploited at the university of lancaster @xcite .",
    "hitherto the andreev scattering technique has only been used to detect turbulent vortex tangles , which for interpretation have been assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic , but which in practice are of unknown density and poorly known spatial extent .",
    "thus , it has not been possible to compare theoretical predictions of heat transport in vortex systems directly to experimental results . in this work",
    "we provide such a comparison and justify the use of the andreev reflection technique as a visualization method of vortices in superfluid @xmath0he - b in the limit of vanishing normal fluid density .",
    "in the ballistic regime of quasiparticle transport the mean free path of thermal excitations is longer than the dimensions of the container .",
    "therefore , thermal equilibrium is obtained via interaction of quasiparticles and container walls and the collisions between excitations can be neglected . in the presence of vortices , the superfluid flow field around the vortex lines",
    "can constrain the quasiparticle trajectories .    in the rest frame of the superfluid condensate the bcs dispersion relation @xmath7 is symmetrical and the minimum energy is the pressure dependent superfluid energy gap @xmath8 . the standard picture of andreev reflection",
    "considers an excitation moving towards an increasing energy gap @xcite . in @xmath0he - b the superfluid flow field modulates the minimum in the excitation spectrum . using the notation by barenghi _",
    "@xcite , the energy @xmath9 of the excitation with momentum @xmath10 in the flow field around a vortex is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the effective kinetic energy of the excitation measured with respect to the fermi energy @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "excitations with @xmath15 are called quasiparticles and excitations with @xmath16 are called quasiholes . for quasiparticles",
    "the group velocity @xmath17 is parallel to the momentum @xmath10 whereas for quasiholes it is antiparallel .",
    "our experiments are performed at the 29  bar pressure , at which the effective mass @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the mass of a @xmath0he atom .",
    "the superfluid velocity @xmath20 is proportional to the gradient of the phase @xmath21 of the order parameter , i.e. , @xmath22 .",
    "if we consider a vortex oriented along the @xmath23 axis in cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath24,@xmath25,@xmath23 ) this becomes @xmath26 , where @xmath27 @xmath28/s is the circulation quantum and @xmath29 the azimuthal unit vector .",
    "the consequence of the interaction term @xmath30 is that an excitation traveling at constant energy may not find a forward - propagating state due to the superflow gradient @xmath31 along the flight path . when the excitation reaches the minimum of the spectrum the group velocity changes sign and it retraces its trajectory as an excitation on the other side of the minimum .",
    "in other words , a quasiparticle andreev reflects as a quasihole and vice versa with a very small momentum transfer @xcite .",
    "let us consider a beam of excitations incident on a single straight vortex .",
    "on one side of the vortex the flow parallel to the group velocity of the excitation reflects quasiparticles and on the other side the antiparallel flow reflects quasiholes .",
    "an excitation is andreev reflected if its energy satisfies @xmath32 .",
    "here @xmath33 is the inclination angle of the excitation trajectory measured with respect to the vortex line and @xmath34 the impact parameter . at temperature",
    "@xmath35 the mean excitation energy is @xmath36 . in our experiments @xmath37 and the momentum @xmath38 is close to the fermi momentum @xmath39  kgm / s , so a typical excitation is reflected if @xmath40 .",
    "for an excitation with @xmath41 this translates to @xmath42 , which is about two orders of magnitude larger than the coherence length @xmath43 nm and the vortex core radius .",
    "thus , in a typical experimental situation the probability of scattering off a vortex core is negligible compared to the cross section for andreev scattering from the flow field around the vortex .",
    "in our experiment we study the heat transported by excitations through a cluster of vortices .",
    "bradley and coworkers did a similar measurement with a vortex tangle as the structure reflecting excitations @xcite .",
    "our experiment is made in a fused quartz cylinder filled with @xmath0he - b .",
    "the cylinder is divided in two parts with a 0.7  mm thick quartz division plate .",
    "the lower part consists of a 30  mm long , 3.5  mm inner diameter tube , which opens to a heat exchanger made out of sintered silver .",
    "the sinter provides good thermal contact with the nuclear cooling stage so that the superfluid @xmath0he below the 0.3 mm orifice can be cooled down to below 0.15  @xmath44 .",
    "the upper part can be modeled as a blackbody radiator ( bbr ) , an enclosure with a weak thermal link to the outside superfluid @xmath0he via a small orifice in the division plate @xcite .",
    "our bbr consists of a 12  cm long section of the quartz tube with 6  mm inner diameter .",
    "this volume is furnished with two mechanical resonators , one acting as a thermometer and the other as a heater .",
    "the heater is used for generating a beam of ballistic quasiparticles through the orifice .",
    "our resonators are commercial quartz tuning forks , which have recently been characterized for probing quantum fluids @xcite .",
    "the forks are made of piezoelectric quartz crystals with electrodes deposited on the surface . when driven with alternating voltage ,",
    "the two prongs of the fork oscillate in anti - phase producing a current @xmath45 , which is proportional to the prong velocity @xmath46 .",
    "the heater fork signal is amplified with a room - temperature i / v converter @xcite before being fed to a two phase lock - in amplifier .",
    "this was found to be important to reduce capacitive losses in the signal line , and thus to measure accurately the signal amplitude which is proportional to the power generated by the fork .",
    "the thermometer fork has 32  khz resonance frequency , a prong cross section of 0.10  mm @xmath47 0.24  mm and a length 2.4  mm .",
    "the heater fork has a higher resonance frequency , 40  khz , to prevent any interference between the forks .",
    "the prongs of the heater are 2.9  mm long and the cross section is 0.36  mm@xmath470.44  mm .",
    "in our temperature range the resonance width of the tuning fork depends only on the damping from ballistic quasiparticles .",
    "the dependence of the linewidth @xmath48 on temperature and prong velocity is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a geometrical factor close to unity @xcite .",
    "the second term in the parenthesis is due to andreev reflection of thermal quasiparticles from the potential flow field created by the fork prongs moving the liquid around them . in our experiments",
    "@xmath51 is small and the velocity - dependent term in eq .",
    "( [ width ] ) can be neglected .",
    "thus , calibrating the fork to act as a thermometer requires determining only the geometry - dependent factor @xmath52 .",
    "the thermometer is calibrated at 0.33  @xmath53 against a @xmath0he - melting curve thermometer , which is thermally coupled to the heat exchanger .",
    "our calibration gives @xmath5417500  hz for the detector .",
    "the intrinsic damping of the fork was measured to be @xmath55  mhz at @xmath56  10  mk in vacuum , which translates into a quality factor @xmath57 .",
    "the rough surface of the sinter with a grain size close to the vortex core diameter provides excellent spots for vortices to nucleate .",
    "thus , the critical rotation velocity @xmath58 for vortex formation is lower than 0.1  rad / s in the bottom section of the long quartz tube . in the equilibrium vortex state in uniform rotation",
    "the sample becomes filled with rectilinear vortices oriented along the rotation axis . to create the vortex array ,",
    "which andreev reflects a part of the heat back to the bbr , we rotate our system at constant velocity around the axis of the container tube .",
    "the vortex density in the equilibrium state is determined by minimization of the free energy in the rotating frame and is given by the solid - body - rotation value @xmath59 .",
    "the array is isolated from the container wall by a narrow annular vortex - free layer .",
    "the width of the vortex - free region @xmath60 is only slightly larger than the intervortex distance @xcite .",
    "= 0 ) all the excitations which do not migrate back to the blackbody radiator due to diffuse scattering from the walls are thermalized in the heat exchanger at the bottom . in rotation ( @xmath61 ) , part of the beam is andreev reflected from the cluster of vortices . ]    to make sure that we have the equilibrium number of vortices in the container we first rapidly increase the rotation velocity to some value which is higher than the target velocity for the measurement .",
    "then we go to the final velocity and wait for the system to settle to the equilibrium vortex state after the annihilation of the extra vortices and the slow relaxation of the vortex array . in our experimental conditions the relaxation takes about one hour .",
    "all the power entering our experimental volume modeled as a blackbody radiator must leave through the hole at the bottom as a flux of energy - carrying excitations . assuming thermal equilibrium inside the bbr the power is given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the quasiparticle density of states and the fermi distribution function , respectively . in the limit",
    "@xmath65 the latter reduces to the boltzmann distribution @xmath66 .",
    "the transmission function @xmath67 is equal to one if an excitation leaving the bbr ( at position @xmath68 on top of the orifice to direction @xmath69 ) reaches the sinter and zero if it is reflected back .",
    "the integration goes over the cross section of the orifice , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the power generated inside the radiator can now be expressed as the sum of the @xmath73-dependent residual heat leak @xmath74 to the bbr and the direct power @xmath75 from the excitations produced by the heater fork @xmath76 here @xmath77 is the effective area of the orifice , which gets smaller when part of the excitations is scattered back to the bbr .",
    "we omit the flow of excitations from the thermal excitation bath in the heat exchanger volume since the quasiparticle density there is at least three orders of magnitude lower than inside the bbr , which is at @xmath78 .",
    "in the measurement the heater fork is driven to create the desired excitation beam corresponding to power @xmath75 leaving the radiator . by controlling the rotation velocity , and thus the vortex density",
    ", we can control the fraction of andreev reflected excitations . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ schem ] , the flow field created by the vortices reflects part of the beam back to the radiator by andreev scattering . as a consequence ,",
    "the temperature above the orifice increases more than with the same applied heating in the absence of vortices .",
    "the fraction @xmath79 of heat reflected back into the radiator , which we call the reflection coefficient , can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ p2 ] ) as @xmath80 there is also a vortex cluster inside the bbr , which may cause a small temperature gradient along the cylinder . nevertheless , the main thermal resistance is across the orifice and eq .",
    "( [ rc ] ) is valid as long as there is thermal equilibrium inside the radiator .    .",
    "]    at each rotation velocity , we apply different power inputs to the radiator and measure the corresponding equilibrium temperature with the thermometer fork . by plotting all the temperature - dependent parts in eq .",
    "( [ p2 ] ) as a function of power @xmath75 we get a straight line ( fig . [ meas ] ) . from the inverse slope of the line we get the effective area @xmath81 and from the intercept with the power axis the heat leak @xmath74 .",
    "the measurement with no vortices gives @xmath82  mm@xmath83 .",
    "this is less than a half of the geometrical area @xmath84 of the orifice .",
    "the main reason is the diffusive backscattering of the excitations from the walls of the 0.7  mm thick division plate and the quartz tube below it . in any case , the absolute value of the effective area is not an important issue since we are only interested in the relative change in eq .",
    "( [ rc ] ) .",
    "the heat leak @xmath74 varies from 12  pw at @xmath85 to 18  pw at @xmath861.8  rad / s . at high rotation velocities",
    "the rotation - induced heat leak fluctuates with variations of about 1  pw .",
    "the rotation velocities used in the measurements had to be carefully selected , since mechanical resonances at certain velocities cause increased and temporally varying heating . figure [ res ] shows the reflection coefficient as a function of the rotation velocity . in the measured rotation velocity range",
    "the dependence of @xmath79 on the vortex density is approximately linear .",
    "we believe that the main source of scatter in the experimental data comes from the variation of the power calibration of the heater fork .    in the measurements the rotation velocity fluctuates on the level of @xmath87 0.01",
    "therefore , it is possible that we create helical perturbations on vortex lines , which can end up increasing the total vortex length and decreasing the polarization in our vortex cluster . by modulating the rotation velocity at different frequencies and amplitudes we can study whether the presence of these perturbations , which are called kelvin waves , affects the reflection coefficient .",
    "we find that even an order of magnitude larger modulation amplitude compared to the highest noise peaks in the rotation velocity barely affects the fraction of transmitted heat flux .",
    "thus , we believe it is safe to omit the effect of kelvin waves in our analysis . our preliminary measurements at very large modulation amplitudes",
    ", however , show a decreasing fraction of transmitted heat , as expected if kelvin waves are generated . in the future",
    ", we are hoping to utilize these techniques to study kelvin waves in more detail .",
    "to test whether our blackbody radiator works as expected , we can analyze how the system reaches thermal equilibrium when the heater is suddenly switched on . the expected time",
    "constant for the thermal relaxation is @xmath88 , where the thermal resistance across the orifice @xmath89 and the heat capacity @xmath90 is given approximately by @xcite @xmath91 here @xmath92  cm@xmath0 is the volume of the bbr and @xmath94 the density of states at the fermi level .",
    "the measured time constant is about 25  s ( see inset in fig . [ meas ] ) , which is in a good agreement with the expected time constant ( @xmath95  s ) obtained using the effective area from the calibration described above .",
    "this analysis also proves that practically all the heat capacity of the system is in the bulk superfluid @xmath0he .",
    "the possible error sources in the effective area are the small statistical error in the determination of the slope ( see fig .",
    "[ meas ] ) and uncertainties in the power calibration , temperature calibration and the value of the gap @xcite .",
    "the reflection coefficient @xmath79 has a weak logarithmic dependence on the parameter @xmath52 and depends on @xmath8 only through the temperature calibration [ eq . ( [ width ] ) ] . the power calibration , if time - independent , has no effect on @xmath79 . we estimate the overall systematic uncertainty of the measurements shown in fig .",
    "[ res ] to be of the order of the scatter in the data .     of the heat andreev reflected back into the blackbody radiator .",
    "the temperature inside the radiator is @xmath78 .",
    "the simulation points are obtained by integrating eq .",
    "( [ p1 ] ) numerically and solving equations ( [ p2 ] ) and ( [ rc ] ) for @xmath79 . ]",
    "in our numerical simulations we calculate the transmission function @xmath96 for our geometry at different rotation velocities and solve the integral in eq .",
    "( [ p1 ] ) numerically using monte carlo integration with importance sampling .",
    "the simulations use the exact geometry of our experimental setup including the thickness and the shape of the radiator orifice . instead of solving for the full equations of motions for excitations , which would require too much computing power ,",
    "only the vortices for which the impact parameter of the excitation is small enough to allow andreev reflection are considered .",
    "we do not assume perfect retro - reflection but take into account the small andreev reflection angle @xcite @xmath97 .",
    "figure [ res ] shows the reflection coefficient as a function of the rotation velocity from the numerical simulations .",
    "the result is in a good agreement with the measurements .    in the simulations diffuse scattering from the container walls",
    "is assumed based on the results in ref . .",
    "in reality , part of the excitations experience andreev reflection at the container surfaces @xcite . including this effect would lead to a decrease of the reflection coefficient in the numerical simulations , as confirmed by our calculations with an unrealistic steplike order - parameter variation , and improve the agreement between the simulations and the measurements .",
    "the full accounting for the detailed reflection processes at diffusely scattering surfaces , including a slight particle - hole anisotropy @xcite , would complicate the transport calculation and we neglect these effects , arguing as follows .",
    "our simulations with fully diffusive scattering yield a ratio @xmath98 which agrees well with the known @xmath84 and @xmath99 obtained from our measurement .",
    "this is neither the case for the model with a steplike order parameter variation at surfaces nor for specular scattering , since to produce the measured @xmath99 the former would require @xmath84 to be roughly two times larger and the latter less than a half of the known geometrical area . moreover , quasiclassical calculations with a smooth model order - parameter suppression profile @xcite show that the real andreev reflection probability at a diffusely scattering surface is only a small fraction of that in the step model . finally , even though the details of the wall scattering processes do have an effect on @xmath100 , they do not affect the reflection coefficient @xmath79 significantly compared to other uncertainties in our model .",
    "recent numerical studies @xcite indicate that especially for dense vortex structures , the total reflecting `` andreev shadow '' is not necessarily the sum of shadows of single vortices .",
    "our clusters are relatively sparse and moreover , after the first diffuse scattering from the walls the probability for the excitation to migrate back to the radiator is not sensitive to small changes in its trajectory .",
    "thus , we believe that our somewhat simplified model reproduces the real experimental situation with good accuracy .",
    "the simulations were tested at different hole radii and positions of the hole on the division plate .",
    "we find that the largest effect on the final result comes from the uncertainty of the radius : increasing or decreasing it by 50% changes the reflection coefficient by approximately @xmath101 .",
    "in conclusion , we describe the first measurement of the interaction between thermal excitations and quantized vortices in a well - defined configuration .",
    "numerical simulations reproduce the experimental results within the margin of uncertainty in the model .",
    "quasiparticle beam techniques are currently the most popular measuring method of vortices in @xmath0he - b below @xmath102 .",
    "our work provides a rigorous quantitative basis for their use and further development for direct visualization purposes .",
