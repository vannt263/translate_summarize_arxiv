    "gravitationally lensed quasars offer the opportunity to study quasar host galaxies at a level of detail not otherwise accessible @xcite , sightlines to study the physical extent of intervening absorption structures @xcite , and the means to constrain lens galaxy masses .",
    "lensed quasar statistics are highly useful probes of cosmology , and time delays from individual lenses provide constraints on the hubble constant ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "several approaches have been adopted to construct large samples of lensed quasars .",
    "one method is to obtain high - resolution images of a large number of sources to look for objects resolved into multiple images on small scales .",
    "this method has been applied at radio wavelengths by the class survey , from which 22 lenses were found in a survey of @xmath2 radio sources @xcite . at optical wavelengths , the subarcsecond resolution required to identify",
    "most lenses has been achieved with hst snapshot surveys .",
    "@xcite found five lenses in a sample of 502 quasars with @xmath3 ; more recently , extensive hst follow - up of sdss quasars at @xmath4 yielded no lenses with @xmath5  separation in a sample of 162 objects @xcite .",
    "all of these searches can be considered more or less blind , in that little or no prior information was used to select lens candidates .",
    "an alternative is to select likely candidates for lensed quasars directly from imaging data .",
    "this is the approach taken by the sdss quasar lens search ( sqls : @xcite , @xcite and references therein , @xcite ) , which has identified 40 new gravitational lenses through follow - up of quasars within the sdss .",
    "candidates are selected either by the presence of a nearby object with similar colors as the quasar , or by the quasar having image being resolved , a hint that it may represent the blend of multiple images at small separations .",
    "only a handful of @xmath6 quasars are currently known to be gravitationally lensed . both blind and targeted surveys for lensed high redshift quasars",
    "are limited by the extreme rarity of the source population . that no lenses were found in the survey of @xcite",
    " which included more than half of the @xmath4 quasars known at the time  is unsurprising given lensing rates of @xmath7 found by surveys of quasars at lower redshifts @xcite ; though the lensing probability increases with redshift @xcite and magnification bias is expected to further enhance the observed lensing rate at high redshift in flux - limited surveys ( for discussions of this effect on sdss quasars , see @xcite  and  @xcite ) .",
    "targeted surveys such as the sqls further depend on the initial selection method employed to identify high - redshift quasar candidates .",
    "in the case of the sdss , quasar targets at @xmath6 are required to have a point - like morphology , introducing a strong bias against small - separation lensed systems .",
    "we present the discovery of a @xmath1 lensed quasar drawn from the sdss .",
    "this is the highest redshift lensed quasar currently known , and only the third at @xmath4 , after bri 0952 - 0115 at @xmath8 ( 1   separation , @xcite ) and pss 2322 + 1944 at @xmath9 ( 1.49  separation , @xcite ) .",

    "we have presented results from three epochs of imaging for this system , summarized in table  [ tab : epochobs ] .",
    "there are some apparent differences when comparing the observations .",
    "we first note that the quoted photometric errors ( tables  [ tab : sdssphot ]  and  [ tab : imagefit ] ) are purely statistical errors from galfit  and do not reflect the uncertainties arising from the fitting itself and from the photometric calibration .",
    "the fitting uncertainties are particularly important for the sdss imaging , which has the poorest resolution and the largest pixel size , hampering robust image decomposition .",
    "we have derived deblended photometry from the sdss images by using galfit  with some constraints to improve the fitting , namely , we fix the positions of the three components to the arc - derived positions , and fix the galaxy fluxes to be within 0.1 mag of the arc values and @xmath33 fluxes we used the @xmath86 and @xmath87 values from  [ sec : obs_uh88 ] , and relaxed the constraint to @xmath90 mag . ] .",
    "the results of this fitting are shown in table  [ tab : sdssphot ] .",
    "we also experimented with unconstrained fitting of the sdss images and had poor results .",
    "in particular , offsetting the initial positions by just a few pixels generally results in a fit with only two components , component b effectively being lost .",
    "this highlights the difficulty of fully characterizing a system such as this from sdss imaging alone .",
    "the colors of component b are slightly redder than those of component a in both the arc and uh88 imaging , but not in the sdss imaging .",
    "the arc colors are @xmath91 and @xmath92 ; on the other hand , the sdss colors are @xmath93 for both components .",
    "the redder color of component b may be due to greater extinction from the lens galaxy ; however , we argue against differential reddening of the two images in   [ sec : obs_mmt ] .",
    "some of the observed color differences between the two components are due to emission line differences of the quasar spectra , discussed in   [ sec : obs_mmt ] .",
    "the remainder are likely due to the difficulty of decomposing the image properly , and are indicative of systematic errors in the photometry greater than the quoted statistical errors .",
    "component b is significantly brighter in the sdss imaging than in either the arc or uh88 imaging .",
    "while the fluxes measured for component a are roughly constant , component b appears to have faded by @xmath94 mag between the sdss and arc / uh88 epochs .",
    "while we have already concluded that systematic uncertainties in the photometry may be large ( @xmath95 mag ) , from experimentation with galfit  we consistently find that b is brighter than a in the sdss imaging .",
    "the relative fluxes of the two components may have changed due to intrinsic variability of the source quasar observed with a time delay between the two images , and/or differential microlensing of the two images .",
    "component b is close to the center of the lens galaxy and its observed flux decrease is quite large ; therefore , microlensing would seem to be the most likely explanation .",
    "spectroscopic observations were obtained on 2009 nov 11 with the red channel instrument on the mmt 6.5 m .",
    "these observations were nearly contemporaneous with the arc imaging , occuring only five days later .",
    "a single 1800s exposure was obtained with a 1.5   slit and the 270 mm@xmath96 grating centered at 7500 .",
    "this provides a dispersion of 3.52   pix@xmath96 at a spectral resolution of @xmath97 .",
    "the fwhm of unresolved emission lines from wavelength calibration exposures is 3.6 pix .",
    "the spatial pixel scale is 0.297  arcsec  pix@xmath96 .",
    "the seeing was 1  and thin clouds were passing overhead during the observation .",
    "the instrument was rotated to pa=36.6@xmath98 in order to align the two components from the sdss imaging in the slit .",
    "lamp exposures were obtained immediately subsequent to the science observation ; however , a standard star observation was not obtained until the following night , using an identical spectrograph configuration but with somewhat better seeing .",
    "all images were reduced with standard iraf routines , including a bias correction , flat fielding from a continuum lamp , wavelength calibration from henear lamps , and relative flux calibration from the standard star bd+284211 obtained on 2009 nov 12 .",
    "the science image was corrected for cosmic rays using the l.a .",
    "cosmic routines @xcite .",
    "the 2d spectra are strongly blended ; in particular , components b and g are separated by only @xmath99 pixels ( 06 ) perpendicular to the dispersion direction ( rows in the mmt image , see figure  [ fig : mmttrace ] ) .",
    "we adopted a heuristic approach to extraction of the spectra with all three components deblended , similar to that of @xcite .",
    "first , the three spectra were treated as gaussians fit independently to each row of the image , using a modified levenberg - marquardt algorithm from the scipy library .",
    "we found that allowing all gaussian components to vary and solving for all nine parameters led to clearly unacceptable results , even with reasonable initial conditions .",
    "we thus found it necessary to apply strong constraints to the gaussian parameters in order to produce acceptable fits .",
    "we assumed that the standard star observation provides a model of the spectral trace on a 2d image , and then used this model to extract the blended science spectra , according to the following process :    1 .",
    "a template trace for the 2d spectra was obtained from the high s / n observation of the standard star .",
    "this trace was used to derive the variation of the position and width of the spectrum along the image rows .",
    "the trace positions were fit with a 7th order polynomial , but they vary by only @xmath100 pixel across the full image .",
    "2 .   along each row of the science image , a gaussian with three free parameters was fit to the leftmost columns of component a ( those least affected by blending from g ) . this fit was compared to the template trace , and used to derive a translation of the template along the image columns to match the trace of a , as well as to derive a scale factor for the widths corresponding to the difference in seeing between science and standard star observations . this scale factor combined with the template widths",
    "provides an estimate of the widths of the point source components a and b. 3 .",
    "the fit to a from step # 2 was subtracted from the image .",
    "the same fit was then translated along columns to the position of b ( as derived from the imaging ) and subtracted again .",
    "the residual image is an approximation to the spectrum of g alone . using the template trace again",
    ", fitting was performed on the residual image to derive the width of the galaxy spectrum along all rows .",
    "the previous steps provide estimates for the positions and widths of each spectral component based on expected positions derived from the imaging observations . however , the slit was likely not aligned perfectly on the center of each component .",
    "we then used the derived fits as initial conditions to a fit on the full 2d image . for this fit ,",
    "the centers of the traces for each of the three components were offset by random amounts of up to @xmath101 pixel along the columns .",
    "fitting across the full image was then repeated 500 times with different initial offsets , allowing only the trace positions to vary .",
    "in other words , copies of the template trace derived from the standard star spectrum were varied in position until the best alignment with the three components was found .",
    "the positions from the best @xmath102 among the repeated fits were then adopted as the best - fit positions for the 2d spectra .",
    "finally , with all positions and widths fixed , a fit was performed allowing only the amplitudes to vary along each row .",
    "the integrated gaussians for the resulting amplitudes and widths were taken to represent the 1d spectra for each of the components .",
    "figure  [ fig : mmtspec ] shows the extracted spectra for the three components .",
    "the spectra have been scaled such that the synthetic @xmath34-band fluxes derived from the spectra match the @xmath34-band fluxes from the arc imaging .",
    "several features of the spectra are worth noting .",
    "first , both the emission and absorption features of a and b show remarkable agreement , providing clear evidence that they represent lensed images of a single quasar at a redshift @xmath1",
    ". this can not be due to incorrect extraction of the 2d spectra , as the gaussians used to extract these two components are cleanly separated . while the line profiles of a and b are almost indistinguishable , the ratio of the two spectra shows that the emission line to continuum ratios are different .",
    "component b is well within the effective radius of the galaxy , and differential microlensing of the continuum and broad line regions of b could explain this effect ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , spectral variability could produce the discrepant line to continuum ratios , and can not be ruled out by our single - epoch spectra . while the relative fluxes of the extracted spectra for the two components are uncertain due to possible differential slit losses , and the extraction was hampered by the strong blending of the b and g spectra , we are confident that the observed difference between the line to continuum ratios is not an artifact of our data . we have experimented with a large number of fitting parameters for extracting the 2d spectra , and in no viable fit does the b spectrum appear to be simply scaled from the a spectrum ; in other words , the line ratios of the two components are always found to be significantly different from the continuum ratios .",
    "in section  [ sec : obs_imgsummary ] we noted color differences between the two components of @xmath103 mag , and considered whether differential reddening was affecting the observed colors .",
    "if one of the images , namely component b , was strongly affected by extinction from the lens galaxy , this would appear in the spectra as a difference in the shapes of the continua measured for the two components .",
    "instead , the ratio of the continua measured for the two components is flat across @xmath104  of the observed wavelength range .",
    "however , some color differences should be introduced by the observed emission line differences .",
    "we derive synthetic @xmath34- and @xmath35-band magnitudes from the mmt spectra and find that the emission line differences contribute @xmath105 mag to the redder color of component b. this reduces the net color difference between the two components from the arc imaging to @xmath106 mag , which is within the uncertainties .",
    "the absorption features in the galaxy spectrum are exactly as expected for a luminous elliptical galaxy at @xmath0 , as derived from the ca absorption features in the sdss spectrum .",
    "this provides further confidence that the extraction was successful , as neither do the galaxy absorption features appear in the quasar spectra , nor do the quasar emission features appear in the galaxy spectrum .",
    "we determine the quasar redshift to be @xmath1 from the peak of the relatively narrow ly@xmath107 line , using the spectrum obtained for component a. the line has significant absorption of its blue wing .",
    "a single gaussian fit to the line with the absorbed region masked results in a lower redshift of @xmath108 ; however , the broad component of the line is often blueshifted with respect to the systemic redshift @xcite .",
    "we fit a power law continuum to the a spectrum and three gaussians to the line , one for a broad component , one for a narrow component , and one for the strong absorption . from this fit ,",
    "the redshift of the narrow component is @xmath109 , in good agreement with the ly@xmath107 redshift , while the broad component is blueshifted by @xmath110 .",
    "while the quasar spectra do show absorption features , particularly between ly@xmath107 and and blueward of , the width of the absorption is not strong enough to meet the criteria generally adopted for broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars @xcite , though it has a non - zero absorption index ( ai = 140  km  s@xmath96 ) as defined by @xcite and may be a mini - bal .",
    "this type of absorption appears in a minority of quasars and its identical shape in the spectra of both quasar images is strong evidence that they are lensed images of a single source as opposed to a binary quasar .",
    ".lens modeling results [ cols= \" > , < \" , ]     we model the system as a singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) lens generating two images of the source quasar .",
    "we use the _ lensmodel _  code @xcite to calculate the properties of both the lensing galaxy and the quasar . the positions and fluxes of each of the quasar images and the position of the lens galaxy obtained from the galfit  fitting of the arc @xmath34-band images",
    "are used to provide a total of 8 constraints .",
    "we solve for the position and flux of the source quasar , as well as the einstein radius ( @xmath111 ) , ellipticity ( @xmath64 , defined as in table  [ tab : galaxyfit ] ) , position angle ( @xmath112 ) , and position of the lensing galaxy . as the model has zero degrees of freedom , the _ lensmodel _  solution converges to @xmath113 .",
    "the results derived from the arc @xmath34-band imaging are given in table  [ tab : lensmodel ] , along with @xmath114 uncertainties ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "when fitting the lens model , positional uncertainties were increased by 50% and the flux uncertainties for all components were set to 5% in order to account for systematic uncertainties in deblending .",
    "the known redshift of the lensing galaxy ( @xmath0 ) enables us to estimate a time delay of 143 days .",
    "there are some discrepancies between the galaxy light profile as measured from the imaging ( table  [ tab : imagefit ] ) and the derived mass model ( table  [ tab : lensmodel ] ) .",
    "if these discrepancies are real , one possibility is that they are due to shear ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) from the nearby galaxies that were not included in the model .",
    "quasars in the sdss have received extensive follow - up to identify lensed objects .",
    "the sqls identifies candidate lensed quasars from the spectroscopically confirmed quasar sample using selection criteria outlined in @xcite .",
    "first , known quasars that are resolved in the imaging may represent two or more lensed images at small separations that are blended into single photometric objects within the sdss database ( morphological selection ) .",
    "second , large separation lenses are selected by searching for nearby objects with similar colors as the quasar ( color selection ) . using these methods",
    ", @xcite recently identified five @xmath116 lensed quasars in the sdss .",
    "two are @xmath117 quasars targeted by the high redshift quasar selection criteria used by the sdss @xcite ; for both objects , the two quasar images are separated by @xmath118  and were successfully deblended by the photometric pipeline .",
    "j0946 + 1835  bears a strong resemblance to the @xmath119 lensed quasar found by @xcite , which was also a galaxy targeted as an lrg by the sdss and shown to be a high redshift lensed quasar by the presence of strong , broad emission lines in the sdss spectrum .",
    "it is instructive to consider whether j0946 + 1835  could have been selected as a lensed quasar candidate in the sqls even if the lensing galaxy had not been targeted for spectroscopy by the sdss .",
    "the sdss registers j0946 + 1835  as two photometric objects , one a point - like object representing component a , and the other a resolved object representing a blend of b and g. the object representing component a is classified as stellar and its colors are relatively unaffected by the lensing galaxy , and thus it could have been considered as a quasar target by the sdss .",
    "in fact , the object is well within the color selection criteria used by the sdss to target @xmath120 quasars @xcite , with a dereddened psf magnitude of @xmath121 and colors @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "it was not considered as a quasar target because it has the photometric flag deblend_nopeak set in multiple bands , indicating that no peak was found in the deblending .",
    "this means that the deblending , and thus the colors , are questionable , and the sdss quasar target selection algorithm excludes such objects from its color selection .    had component a not been flagged deblend_nopeak , it would have been a primary quasar target in the sdss .",
    "once identified as a quasar , it would be further considered as a lens candidate by the sqls .",
    "component a has a stellar classification in the sdss and its psf likelihood is high enough ( ` star_l`(r)=0.06 and ` star_l`(i)=0.07 ) to fail to meet the morphological selection criteria of the sqls @xcite .",
    "in addition , the strong blending of the quasar and galaxy flux in the b+g object causes significant color differences between the two sdss objects ( @xmath124 ) , such that it would also fail to satisfy the color selection criteria .",
    "thus , in the hypothetical ( though generally expected ) case that the stellar sdss object was targeted as a quasar instead of the galaxy object being targeted as an lrg , this object would not have been identified as a lens candidate .",
    "it was fortuitous that the lensing galaxy was the object targeted for spectroscopy , as the blended quasar and galaxy features in the spectrum made the nature of the object evident .",
    "furthermore , since the b+g object was spectroscopically identified as a quasar but clearly has the morphology of a galaxy , j0946 + 1835  will be included in the sqls dr7 additional sample by modified morphological selection ( see section 5 of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "many of the difficulties encountered with selecting this object as a gravitational lens candidate arise from the bright lensing galaxy .",
    "the galaxy effectively hides the second quasar image , both in terms of detecting a second psf image , as well as the blending of the galaxy and quasar colors .",
    "the galaxy also affected the well - separated quasar image by inducing additional photometric errors .",
    "high - redshift quasars have extremely red colors and are detected in only a few optical bands , and it is easy to imagine that similar lensed quasars may be hiding behind bright lensing galaxies .",
    "one way to find such objects is in the spectra of galaxy targets , as was the case here .",
    "this method has been used explicitly to find lensed background galaxies in the spectra of lrgs by the sloan lens acs survey ( slacs ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we have identified the highest known redshift lensed quasar . j0946 + 1835",
    "consists of a lens galaxy at @xmath0 and a pair of quasar images produced from a source at @xmath1 .",
    "an object representing a blend of the lensing galaxy and one of the quasar images was targeted as a luminous red galaxy by the sdss and classified as a quasar based on the spectrum .",
    "subsequent observations show that the quasar images are separated by 3  and have a relatively low total magnification of 3.2 .",
    "comparison of photometry from three epochs indicates that there is variability of the two quasar images .",
    "deblended spectra of the three components show that the two images represent a single quasar , and suggest that microlensing may affect the relative line equivalent widths , though spectroscopic observations spanning multiple epochs ( preferably with higher spatial resolution ) are needed to confirm this interpretation",
    ".    continued photometric and spectroscopic monitoring of this object can be used to measure a time delay to compare with the value derived here , which constrains the hubble constant @xcite .",
    "multiple spectroscopic epochs can also be used to look for variation of the quasar emission line equivalent widths consistent with a microlensing signature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which constrains the size of the broad line region .",
    "lensing can also distort the host galaxy image away from the bright active nucleus such that it can be resolved @xcite .",
    "probing the host galaxy of this object with hst imaging has the potential to allow the relationship between black hole mass and bulge mass to be examined for the most distant lensed quasar currently known .",
    "this is the third high - redshift lensed quasar found in the spectrum of an object targeted by the sdss as an lrg , joining the @xmath119 lensed quasar reported by @xcite and a @xmath125 lens from the sqls high - redshift sample @xcite .",
    "the sdss - iii will target 1.5 million lrgs to a flux limit @xmath126 mag fainter than the sdss - i / ii ; this fifteen - fold increase in the number of lrg spectra has the potential to result in a similar increase in discoveries of high - redshift quasars lensed by those galaxies and revealed by their spectra .    another approach to identify quasars is by their variability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". planned synoptic surveys such as pan - starrs @xcite and lsst @xcite will be able to identify high redshift quasar lenses through systematic searches for pairs of stellar objects at small separations that both vary ( with a time delay ) , or by looking for resolved objects ( galaxies ) that vary @xcite .",
    "@xcite predict that thousands of new lensed quasars will be discovered by upcoming time - domain surveys , including several hundred at @xmath4 from the lsst alone .",
