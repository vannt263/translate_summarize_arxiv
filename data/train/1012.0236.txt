    "the experimental realization of the crossover between a molecular bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) and an atomic bardeen - cooper - schriefer state ( bcs ) in fermionic alkali vapours , such as @xmath0li and @xmath1k , is one of the most fundamental and far reaching results of the current ultracold quantum fluids research .",
    "the route to this crossover of macroscopic states started with the early observations of molecular bec@xcite continuing to the observation of actual fermi pairing in the bcs side@xcite that directly verified the crossover , and in the meantime , the superfluid nature of the quantum fluids was established@xcite .",
    "furthermore , a whole class of spectroscopic techniques have been developed to enquire about the elementary excitations spectra@xcite which not only should verify the superfluid characteristics of the state but should also shed light on their true microscopic details .",
    "of additional relevance , and the matter of the present article , is the study of thermodynamic properties@xcite and , in particular , of direct measurement of the _ contact _ by stewart et al.@xcite , a thermodynamic variable we discuss below .",
    "we refer to the review by giorgini et al.@xcite for further discussion and additional references .",
    "the bec - bcs crossover occurs as a consequence of the change of the atomic scattering length by means of external magnetic fields , with the concomitant presence of a two - channel feschbach resonance@xcite , that permits a switch between the two extreme states .",
    "this phenomenon , as originally predicted by eagles@xcite and leggett@xcite , can also be theoretically studied considering a one - channel potential resonance that allows for the change of sign of the scattering length , indicating the existence of the molecular bec and atomic bcs . among the many studies sparked by these experiments ,",
    "we are concerned here with the appearance of a _ new _ variable called the _",
    "contact_. this was originally introduced in a series of papers by tan@xcite , and further analyzed by others@xcite , and it has proved to be of relevance in the determination and understanding of bec - bcs crossover .",
    "the contact , as introduced by tan@xcite , tells us about the asymptotic behavior of the wavevector occupation number of fermions @xmath2 , and it is defined as @xmath3 that is , since the contact approximation of the interatomic potential @xmath4 , implemented by replacing @xmath5 with @xmath6 the scattering length , necessarily introduces difficulties as @xmath7 , tan found that this produced a divergent but well characterized @xmath8 behavior of the occupation number as @xmath9 .",
    "this , in turn , opens a door to  correct \" the well - kown ultraviolet divergences produced by the contact approximation ( [ a1 ] ) .",
    "tan called the limit ( [ c1 ] ) the _ contact_. further analysis@xcite showed that an _ adiabatic _ change of the scattering length @xmath6 , relates the contact to the energy @xmath10 of the system by means of the relationship , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the volume of the system , and the derivative is taken at entropy @xmath13 constant . here and throughout",
    ", we shall use @xmath14 as the inverse of the scattering length .    in this article",
    "we point out a further and very simple connection between the scattering length @xmath6 and the contact @xmath15 , a relationship that seems to have gone unnoticed .",
    "we shall argue that since @xmath6 , or better @xmath14 , is a _ bona fide _ intensive thermodynamic state variable , it must have an extensive conjugate variable .",
    "we show here that this variable is the contact @xmath15 ( times the volume @xmath12 ) .",
    "we shall see that expressions ( [ c1 ] ) and ( [ c2 ] ) , among other properties , follow from an analysis of general thermodynamic considerations and of this identification . to illustrate our results ,",
    "we shall analyze in detail all the thermodynamic predictions of the mean - field theory@xcite of the bcs - bec crossover at zero temperature , @xmath16 .",
    "as we shall see , the results drawn from this approximate theory are in reasonable agreement with both other more precise theories@xcite and recent experiments@xcite .",
    "this work , we believe , adds to the comprehension and potential use of the contact variable .",
    "the observation we made here is based on the fact that any mechanical variable of a system that can be externally varied , and that can change the current thermodynamic state of the system , is in itself a thermodynamic state variable . as an example , any adiabatic change of an internal parameter of the hamiltonian of the system ( keeping , say , the volume and number of particles constant ) necessarily results in an increase or decrease of the temperature of the system ; it is thus a thermodynamic parameter that determines the macroscopic state of the system .",
    "let us therefore take @xmath14 as a thermodynamic variable .",
    "using the inverse of @xmath6 is a matter of convenience . by its mere nature",
    ", @xmath17 is an intensive variable , namely it does not scale with the size of the system .",
    "since most of the theoretical analyses of many - body systems is performed in the grand canonical ensemble , let us first consider the grand potential @xmath18 of a _ homogenous _ gas .",
    "such a function is a fundamental relationship that yields all the thermodynamics of the system@xcite in terms of the following variables @xmath19 , where @xmath12 is the volume of the system , @xmath20 its temperature , @xmath21 the chemical potential , and we have assumed an additional dependence on @xmath17 .",
    "being a function of @xmath22 this is equivalent to state that @xmath23 which amounts to identify ( or define ) the entropy @xmath13 , the pressure @xmath24 , the ( average ) number of particles @xmath25 , and an additional variable , the contact @xmath26 , as partial derivatives of @xmath18 . in particular ,",
    "the contact is @xmath27 thus , just as @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , @xmath31 are a pair of conjugate variables . @xmath17 being intensive implies that @xmath32 is an extensive variable . as shown below , it is related related to tan s definition of the contact @xmath15 as @xmath33 .",
    "that is , tan s @xmath15 is an intensive variable , a contact density ( or contact  intensity \" ) , and in this case is a function @xmath34 .",
    "the relationship to statistical physics serves to find further properties of @xmath26 and @xmath17 .",
    "recall that in the grand canonical ensemble , the state is given by the density matrix @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the number of particles operator and @xmath37 the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "this hamiltonian depends parametrically on the scattering length @xmath6 , as we further specify below .",
    "@xmath38 is the grand partition function , @xmath39 the grand potential is @xmath40 and the entropy is given by @xmath41 from this we obtain , by substituting ( [ rho ] ) and ( [ xi ] ) , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the average energy .",
    "the expression for @xmath13 allows to solve for @xmath44 , that with the use of ( [ do ] ) yields , @xmath45 from this expression one finds that the contact is also given by , @xmath46 which is the known expression ( [ c2 ] ) also derived by tan@xcite .",
    "it is the so - called adiabatic definition of the contact .",
    "it is clear that if one considers the helmholtz free energy , @xmath47 , the contact is now @xmath48 , and so on for any other thermodynamic potential .",
    "we now specialize to a fermionic many - body system with two - body interactions , and assume that the collisions can occur only by one open channel .",
    "below we comment on the case of two - channel collisions@xcite .",
    "in general , any real interatomic potential @xmath4 depends at least on two parameters , say the depth of the potential @xmath49 and its range @xmath50 . at low energies or temperatures ,",
    "both parameters can be replaced by the scattering length @xmath6 , and accordingly , the potential is replaced by the so - called contact potential , as given by eq.([a1 ] ) . as it is well known this approximation is plagued with ultraviolet divergences and several schemes have been developed to repair them .",
    "incidentally , tan s work on the contact variable is another instance to deal with this problem .",
    "as we shall return below , the replacement of the several parameters of the interatomic potential by solely the scattering length has very strong implications on the form of the thermodynamic potentials . in any case",
    ", the hamiltonian in this approximation may be written as @xmath51 where we have already considered a mixture of fermions , say , in different internal states @xmath52 1 and 2 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 being their field operators . the gas is assumed to be confined in a rigid box of volume @xmath12 and it is , therefore , homogenous . using the results above , eqs .",
    "( [ dervs ] ) and ( [ xi ] ) with hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) , one immediately finds that the contact variable is , @xmath55 where the average can be taken in any ensemble , even though we obtained it in the grand ensemble .",
    "this result was originally derived by braaten and platter@xcite .",
    "these authors argue that a way of avoiding the ultraviolet divergence in ( [ cbra ] ) is by replacing @xmath6 by @xmath56 with @xmath57 a cutoff parameter .",
    "moreover , after a careful analysis , they find that the above value of @xmath26 is precisely the original tan definition of the contact @xmath58 as given in equation ( [ c1 ] ) , namely , as the coefficient of the @xmath59 tail of the number distribution .",
    "if the gas is confined by an inhomogenous potential , as in the current experiments with ultracold gases , say in a harmonic trap@xcite , @xmath60 one must add to the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) a term @xmath61 .",
    "this addition is by no means trivial since it modifies the thermodynamic description of the system . as discussed in refs.@xcite , among others ,",
    "the thermodynamic limit is now @xmath62 @xmath63 , with @xmath64= constant .",
    "this yields the  generalized \" volume @xmath65 as an extensive thermodynamic variable that replaces the usual volume @xmath12 of a rigid - box potential .",
    "in addition there appears a conjugate ",
    "generalized \" pressure @xmath66 that replaces the hydrostatic pressure @xmath24 .",
    "the details of these variables as well as their physical interpretation has been given at length in refs.@xcite . here",
    ", suffice to say that the grand potential of the trapped gas is a function @xmath67 .",
    "the contact is simply , @xmath68 and it is now a function of @xmath69 .",
    "similarly to the homogenous case , eq.([euler ] ) , one has the euler relationship , @xmath70 , and the generalized pressure may be identified as @xmath71 , namely as the grand potential per unit of generalized volume .",
    "we shall use this result below .    with the use of the local density approximation ( lda )",
    "one can calculate all thermodynamic variables in the trapped gas .",
    "in particular , following the procedure of ref.@xcite , one can show that if one has knowledge of the contact density @xmath72 of the homogenous case , the contact in the trapped gas can be obtained by lda prescription , @xmath73 this result will be used in section 4 .",
    "if one considers two - channel collisions , such as those involved by a feschbach resonance , zhang and leggett@xcite and werner et al.@xcite have shown that the number of bosonic molecules in the closed channel is also related to the contact @xmath26 , up to a quantity that depends crucially on the two - body interactions involved in the resonance .",
    "werner et al.@xcite find very good agreement with the experimental results by partridge et al.@xcite .",
    "although we shall not consider this case here , it is of interest to mention that a calculation of the contact with a single channel , as performed in the present article , gives reliable information on a quantity that also depends on the details of two - channel collisions .",
    "below we return to this point where we discuss the  universality \" of the obtained thermodynamics .",
    "so far , we have just shown how all the known results concerning the contact follow directly from the identification of @xmath14 and @xmath26 as conjugate thermodynamic variables . here",
    ", we would like to make some general considerations regarding the functional dependence of the different variables by assuming the contact approximation of the interatomic potential , eq.([a1 ] ) .",
    "that is , we assume that the interatomic interaction depends solely on the scattering length @xmath6 .    let us analyze first the homogenous case . in the grand canonical ensemble the independent variables are @xmath22 with only two parameters , planck constant @xmath74 and the atoms mass @xmath75 .",
    "we note that the number of particles is a dependent variable @xmath76 .",
    "thermodynamics ensures that one can single - value invert @xmath77 with @xmath78 the homogenous particle density .",
    "thus , any other thermodynamic variable can be written in terms of @xmath79 , for instance , the contact @xmath80 or the energy @xmath81 .",
    "now , as long as the particle density is never taken as zero , @xmath82 is always positive",
    ". therefore , one can use @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath82 to adimensionalize or reduce all the other variables .",
    "given the fact that we are dealing with fermions , it proves convenient to use the fermi energy and momentum @xmath83 and the mass @xmath75 , as the quantities to define dimensionless reduced variables .",
    "we shall place a `` tilde '' @xmath84 on top to denote reduced variables in the homogenous case .",
    "for instance , for intensive variables , @xmath85 for extensive variables we will take them as per particle , namely , @xmath86 and so on .",
    "we note that the number density becomes a number , @xmath87    hence , since extensive quantities are of the form @xmath88 and intensive ones @xmath89 , then , it must be true that all the reduced variables depend _ only _ on @xmath90 and @xmath91 , namely , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and so on .",
    "this indicates that the dependence is  universal \" , as in a law of corresponding thermodynamic states@xcite .",
    "however , we want to make this point clear : this dependence is only possible because the hamiltonian has only two parameters , @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( @xmath6 is a variable not a parameter ) .",
    "if the interatomic potential had one more parameter in addition to @xmath6 , then this  universal \" dependence will not be possible .",
    "that is , an explicit dependence on the density will still occur .",
    "recently , ho@xcite introduced a universality hypothesis in which , near the unitarity limit @xmath95 or @xmath96 , all interatomic potential parameters become irrelevant except the scattering length @xmath6 .",
    "this implies , as we see here , that all thermodynamic variables , for _ fixed _ values of @xmath90 and @xmath91 , behave , up to a numerical constant , as if the system were an _ ideal _ fermi gas . here",
    ", by assuming at the outset that the only relevant interatomic potential quantity is the scattering length , we find that such a hypothesis is always valid . in real systems , and away from unitarity , one expects a dependence , maybe weak , on other interatomic potential parameters . in this connection",
    "is important to mention the recent work by zhang and leggett@xcite , where they argue that near unitarity , where @xmath97 is very large and becomes the dominant length , the many - body physics is dictated by the contact potential and , thus , its thermodynamic contribution is actually universal , thus lending validity to ho s hypothesis .",
    "zhang and leggett , though , are very explicit in the fact that certain quantities are also influenced by the details of the two - body physics , such as the number of bound pairs or molecules in the closed channel of a feschbach resonance .",
    "as it turns out , the number of bound pairs in the closed channel is found to be directly proportional , both , to a quantity that depends on the details of the two - body interatomic potentials _ and _ to the contact @xmath26 , that being a many - body thermodynamic quantity is independent of the details of the collision .",
    "thus , two - body physics matters , but a one - channel calculation of thermodynamic properties , such as the contact , suffices to determine the many - body contributions .    for the case of a gas trapped in a harmonic potential",
    "the situation is very similar .",
    "first , we note that the number of particles is @xmath98 with @xmath65 .",
    "again , we solve for the chemical potential @xmath99 , and express all other thermodynamic quantities as functions of @xmath100 , say @xmath101 .",
    "similarly , we introduce the fermi energy and momentum _ in the trap _ as , @xmath102 we see that the combination @xmath103 is a generalized particle density for the harmonic trap .",
    "we define dimensionless reduced variables in the trap , denoted with a  hat \" @xmath104 , in an analogous way to the homogeneous case , @xmath105 for intensive variables , while for extensive ones @xmath106 and so on . again , any ",
    "hat \" variable thus defined depends only on @xmath107 and @xmath108 , i.e. @xmath109 .",
    "further explicit results can now be obtained by appealing to the mean - field bcs - bec theory@xcite at zero temperature @xmath16 , as clearly described by leggett@xcite . within this approximation",
    ", one finds that the grand potential @xmath18 is given by , @xmath110 + \\frac{1}{2}\\delta^2 \\sum_k \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_k }    - v \\frac{m}{4 \\pi \\hbar^2 } \\delta^2 \\eta , \\label{omf}\\ ] ] where @xmath111 and the  gap \" @xmath112 is a function of @xmath113 given by the transcendental equation , @xmath114 = -   \\frac{m}{2 \\pi \\hbar^2 }   \\eta .\\label{gap}\\ ] ] these two equations yield , as expected , @xmath115 .",
    "the thermodynamic limit is assumed to be used in the form @xmath116 .",
    "few words are in order here .",
    "this form of the grand potential is obtained by considering that the ground state of the two - species fermion mixture is given by the bcs variational state@xcite . and",
    "most importantly , we recall that we have already included in ( [ omf ] ) , by hand , the  counterterms \" needed to avoid the ultraviolet divergences that the contact approximation ( [ a1 ] ) necessarily introduces . strictly speaking ,",
    "the mean - field approximation is only valid in the weakly - interacting regime , which requires that @xmath117 .",
    "that is , it should only be valid in the limit of very large @xmath118 ; this immediately prohibits to use the theory in the strongly interacting crossover region @xmath119 .",
    "nevertherless , as we shall see below , one finds results that agree reasonably well with current experimental results@xcite . we have not considered finite temperatures here since , on the one hand our purpose is to exemply the main results , and on the other , it is well known that this approach fails in considering correctly all the thermal excitations@xcite .",
    "we are now in a position to calculate all the thermodynamic properties of the system by using @xmath18 as given by ( [ omf ] ) and ( [ gap ] ) , as a function of @xmath120 and by recalling that @xmath13 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are given by its partial derivatives .",
    "we are particularly interested in @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",

    "one sees that in the limit @xmath9 , the quantity @xmath126 converges to @xmath127 as consistently given by ( [ c ] ) and showing , within this model , the equality predicted by tan , see eq.([c1 ] ) .",
    "because of this identity , measurement of the contact@xcite may lead to an alternative determination of properties of the excitations energy spectra of these systems .    before studying some properties of the contact , from the perspective of eq.([c ] ) , we would like to point out that if we returned to the many - body description of the interacting fermion gas , in terms of the creation and annihilation operators of particles in states @xmath125 , and then implemented the contact approximation of the interatomic potential , eq .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) , one would find that the sums are plagued by ultraviolet divergences .",
    "as tan has suggested , a way to regularize the theory would be to introduce a kind of counterterm in the form @xmath128 .",
    "we find that in the mean - field bec - bcs theory one can also regularize the theory at that level , namely , before implementing the variational scheme , and the counterterm is precisely tan s prescription . at least at the level of a mean - field theory",

    "although this certainly needs a more careful analysis , we believe the reason behind this consistency may be both , the fact that one may ascribe a kind of  mean \" gap in a trap , and that the dependence of the contact with @xmath17 is very similar in the homogenous and the trapped cases .    to end this section , and because this suggests an independent and useful experimental determination , we calculate the corresponding generalized pressure for the trapped gas . as discussed at large in refs.@xcite , the grand potential in the trap",
    "is @xmath71 thus defining a generalized , pressure @xmath66 , conjugate to the generalized volume @xmath207 .",
    "this generalized pressure is the _ bona - fide _ counterpart of the hydrostatic pressure @xmath24 of the homogenous gas .",
    "the equation of state of the trapped gas can be given in terms of @xmath208 just as @xmath209 in the homogenous one .",
    "it turns out that the measurement of @xmath66 appears as a relatively simple task , given the enormous recent experimental advances .",
    "however , to make a direct comparison with the homogenous case , we will calculate the reduced grand potential @xmath210 instead .",
    "one can show that @xmath211 . to perform this evaluation",
    "we could resort to integration of the homogenous grand potential density using lda .",
    "however , as shown in refs.@xcite , one can instead use an extremely simple formula for the grand potential in the trap , namely , @xmath212 that is , sole knowledge of the density profile and the external potential suffice to know the grand potential .",
    "we insist , if one has simultaneous knowledge of the number of particles @xmath25 , the temperature @xmath20 , and the scattering length @xmath6 , then the equation of state of the system is immediately obtained . using @xmath16 and",
    "reduce units for the trap , we find the following formula @xmath213 where again the upper value is used for @xmath182 and the lower one for @xmath183 .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "comparing with fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we find once more a remarkable similarity with the homogenous case .",
    "in this article we have performed a simple and straightforward derivation of the contact @xmath26 as the thermodynamic conjugate variable to the inverse of the scattering length @xmath6 .",
    "we have shown that essentially all the known results regarding the contact follow from this identification .",
    "we see that this identification is independent of any microscopic model one uses , as long as the scattering length can be varied externally . for instance",
    ", the state of the system may have any additional parametric dependence on other interatomic potential parameters and still the contact remains meaningful .",
    "clearly , this is also valid for gases of bose atoms . in the case where one can disregard other atomic parameters and keep the scattering length as the only two - body interaction dependence , dictated by the physical situation at hand",
    ", then a  universal \" or law of corresponding states emerges ; namely , in the appropriate reduced variables , all thermodynamic variables depend on the reduced temperature and inverse scattering length .    using the mean - field bec - bcs theory , as introduced by eagles@xcite and leggett@xcite , one can explicitely exemplify all the above description . furthermore , one finds a yet another identification of the contact , that is , its relationship to the ( square ) gap @xmath112 .",
    "this may serve as an additional and independent way of measuring or determining qualities of the atomic excitations spectra .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that this approximated theory , in principle not valid in the crossover bec - bcs region , still gives reasonable quantitative results , comparing well with both quantum monte - carlo calculations@xcite as well as with actual experimental data@xcite .",
    "we would like to stress the fact that there is a remarkable similarity of the dependence of the reduced chemical potential , contact and pressure , on the reduced inverse of scattering length , for the homogenous and the trapped gases .",
    "this is not at all obvious from the outset and we wonder if this similarity is privative of the mean - field model or if it is a more general result .",
    "it is curious to note that , in this case of mean - field with sole dependence on the scattering length , the asymptotic values at the bec and bcs extremes are more ",
    "universal \" than at unitarity !",
    "it remains as a useful excersice to work out all the thermodynamics here presented using field theoretical extensions of mean field , see refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , to obtain more precise values at unitarity .    in this article",
    "we have also pointed out the simplicity and , yet , the relevance of the measurement of the generalized pressure for trapped gases . besides being readily measured just by knowing the density profile , the equation of state of the system is actually given in terms of this quantity , the frequency of the trap , the number of particles and the temperature .",
    "its study and experimental determination may shed light on other properties , such as phase transitions and heat capacities@xcite .",
    "99                                                                            there is no loss of generality by restricting to an _ isotropic _ harmonic potential , since in the thermodynamic limit all thermodynamic properties depend on the external potential only by the frequency @xmath214 , where @xmath215 , @xmath216 , are the frequencies of an _ anisotropic _ trap ."
