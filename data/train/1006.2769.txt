    "the interference channel ( ic ) models the situation where several independent transmitters communicate with their corresponding receivers over a common channel . due to the shared medium",
    ", each receiver suffers from interferences caused by the transmissions of other transceiver pairs .",
    "the research of ic was initiated by shannon  @xcite and the channel was first thoroughly studied by ahlswede  @xcite .",
    "later , carleial  @xcite established an improved achievable rate region by applying the superposition coding scheme . in  @xcite , han and",
    "kobayashi obtained the best achievable rate region known to date for the general ic by utilizing simultaneous decoding at the receivers .",
    "recently , this rate region has been re - characterized with superposition encoding for the sub - messages  @xcite . however , the capacity region of the general ic is still an open problem except for several special cases  @xcite .",
    "many variations of the interference channel have also been studied , including the ic with feedback  @xcite and the ic with conferencing encoders / decoders  @xcite . in this paper , we study another variation of the ic : the state - dependent two - user ic with state information non - causally known at both transmitters .",
    "this situation may arise in a multi - cell downlink communication problem , where two interested cells are interfering with each other and the mobiles suffer from some common interference ( which can be from other cells and viewed as state ) non - causally known at both base - stations . notably , communication over state - dependent channels",
    "has drawn lots of attentions due to its wide applications such as information embedding  @xcite and computer memories with defects  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding framework was also initiated by shannon in  @xcite , which established the capacity of a state - dependent discrete memoryless ( dm ) point - to - point channel with causal state information at the transmitter . in  @xcite , gelfand and pinsker obtained the capacity for such a point - to - point case with the state information non - causally known at the transmitter .",
    "subsequently , costa  @xcite extended gelfand - pinsker coding to the state - dependent additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel , where the state is an additive zero - mean gaussian interference .",
    "this result is known as the dirty - paper coding technique , which achieves the capacity as if there is no such an interference . for the multi - user case ,",
    "extensions of the afore - mentioned schemes were provided in  @xcite for the multiple access channel , the broadcast channel , and the degraded gaussian relay channel , respectively .    in this paper , we study the dm state - dependent ic with state information non - causally known at the transmitters and develop two coding schemes , both of which jointly apply rate splitting and gelfand - pinsker coding . in the first coding scheme ,",
    "we deploy simultaneous encoding for the sub - messages and in the second one , we deploy superposition encoding for the sub - messages .",
    "the associated achievable rate regions are derived based on the respective coding schemes .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . the channel model and the definition of achievable rate region are presented in section [ sec_2 ] . in section [ sec_3 ] ,",
    "we provide two achievable rate regions based on the two different coding schemes , respectively .",
    "finally , we conclude the paper in section [ sec_5 ] .",
    "consider the interference channel as shown in fig .",
    "1 , where two transmitters communicate with the corresponding receivers through a common channel dependent on state @xmath0 . the transmitters do not cooperate with each other ; however , they both know the state information @xmath0 non - causally , which is unknown to either of the receivers . each receiver needs to decode the information from the respective transmitter .",
    "we use the following notations throughout this paper .",
    "the random variable is defined as @xmath1 with value @xmath2 in a finite set @xmath3 .",

    "the corresponding sequences are denoted by @xmath5 with length @xmath6 .",
    "the state - dependent two - user interference channel is defined by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 are two input alphabet sets , @xmath9 are the corresponding output alphabet sets , @xmath10 is the state alphabet set , and @xmath11 is the conditional probability of @xmath12 given @xmath13 .",
    "the channel is assumed to be memoryless , i.e. , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the element index for each sequence .",
    "a @xmath16 code for the above channel consists of two independent message sets @xmath17 and @xmath18 , two encoders that assign a codeword to each message @xmath19 and @xmath20 based on the non - causally known state information @xmath21 , and two decoders that determine the estimated messages @xmath22 and @xmath23 or declare an error from the received sequences .",
    "the average probability of error is defined as : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is assumed to be uniformly distributed in @xmath26 .",
    "a rate pair @xmath27 of non - negative real values is achievable if there exists a sequence of @xmath16 codes with @xmath28 as @xmath29 .",
    "the set of all achievable rate pairs is defined as the capacity region .",
    "in this section , we propose two new coding schemes for the dm interference channel with state information non - causally known at both transmitters and present the associated achievable rate regions . for both coding schemes , we jointly deploy rate splitting and gelfand - pinsker coding . in the first coding scheme , we use simultaneous encoding on the sub - messages , while in the second one we apply superposition encoding .",
