    "the recent discovery of a new class of radio transient sources , known as rotating radio transients ( rrats ) @xcite , suggests that radio transient phenomena may be quite common for typical pulsars .",
    "about 11 such sources have been detected so far ; they are characterized by short outbursts of a typical from 2 to 30 millisecond duration with an average interval between two consective bursts from a few minutes to a few hours .",
    "ten rrats have their periodicities determined and three of them have their period derivatives identified .",
    "observations appear to suggest that these objects are part of the normal pulsar population , with periods of a few seconds , within the period range of typical radio pulsars , and magnetic fields up to @xmath0 , close to a lower limit of the magnetic field of the known magnetars .",
    "no transient x - rays or optical counter part has been observed , though thermal x - ray emission was detected from one rrat , which appears to be similar to x - ray dim isolated neutron stars ( xdins ) @xcite .",
    "three rrats with both periods and period derivatives identified overlap with normal radio pulsars in the @xmath1-@xmath2 ( pulsar period vs period derivative ) distribution , which strongly suggests that rrats may have similar properties to radio pulsars and should have normal radio emission as well . however",
    ", regular radio pulses have not been detected from any of these sources , suggesting that either ( 1 ) these radio bursts are distinct from the normal radio emission in aspects of emission geometry or processes or ( 2 ) normal radio pulses are too weak to be detectable @xcite . for case",
    "( 1 ) , one could postulate , for example , that radio emission jumps between two alternative beaming direction , one of which intersects the earth . for case",
    "( 2 ) , rrats may be considered as extreme pulses and the ` missing ' normal radio pulses can be detected with a sufficiently long observing time @xcite .",
    "@xcite specifically considered psr b0656 + 14 , which is a nearby pulsar that has pulsed x - rays and intense bursty radio pulses similar to rrats .",
    "they suggested that if this pulsar were at a distance similar to that rrats , one would see the strong radio bursts as rrats and its normal radio emission becomes nondetectable .",
    "if rrats are indeed pulsars , one has a major difficulty in interpretation of the observed intense radio bursts on the basis of conventional polar cap models because most of rrats have long periods and pair production is not effective .",
    "@xcite proposed that the bursty emission by rrats is due to circumpulsar asteroids randomly straying into the magnetosphere ; the neutral material is evaporated and ionized , leading to a sudden downward flow of charged particles in the polar region , which in turn ignites a transient pair cascade toward the pc .",
    "the low - mass disk hypothesis has some observational support from the recent discovery of the fall - back disk of a magnetar , cf .",
    "@xcite . one main ingredient of the cordes & shannon s model is that a cascade is assumed to be due to acceleration in the outer gap .",
    "however , rrats are in the regime in the @xmath1-@xmath2 distribution where the outer gap is inactive for pair production ( through photon - photon collision ) except for the case of a nearly orthogonal inclination angle where the outer gap may form close to the pc and pair production through a single photon decay in the magnetic field is important . in this latter case ,",
    "the cascade has to be close to the pc and backward emission from the cascade may not be able to propagate freely through the intervening plasma near the star in the closed field line region ( cflr ) where induced three - wave interactions are expected to be strong @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose that typical pulsars may have radiation belts in the cflr where relativistic plasmas are trapped .",
    "the trapping regions bear many similarities to the earth s radiation belts .",
    "for example , they are similarly subject to various low - frequency disturbances that disrupt the trapped plasma causing intense precipitation . while in the case of the earth s van allen belts , which are subject to disruption by geomagnetic storms due to the solar wind , the proposed main disturbances to the pulsar s radiation belts are low - frequency alfvn waves generated from the star s surface as a result of stellar oscillations @xcite or shear waves in the neutron star s crust due to starquakes @xcite .",
    "it is suggested here that transient radio emission similar to rrats can be generated as a result of catastrophic disruption of the trapping region and that the coherent emission is produced by particles precipitating toward the star .",
    "the density of the trapped plasma can be maintained at a much higher value than the local gj density . in the trapping region",
    "the magnetic field is relatively weak and the synchrotron decay time is long so that the plasma can be replenished , leading to a build - up in the density .",
    "the major sources of the trapped plasma can be particle acceleration in a dormant outer gap or ablation and ionization of the accreted neutral matter .",
    "we assume that low - level accretion of neutral grains from a dust disk or from the ism occurs and that the accreted matter is ionized inside the lc feeding charged particles directly to both the open field line region ( oflr ) @xcite and cflr @xcite .",
    "note that there were also previous discussions on accretion of neutral material from the ism and possible effects on radio emission by ionization of the neutral matter in the pulsar magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "charged particles created from destruction and ionization of neutral material in the cflr can accumulate and be trapped in the region .",
    "charged particles created in the oflr can be accelerated in the outer gap and inject relativistic pairs into the trapping region .",
    "high - energy gamma rays emitted by the accelerated particles produce pairs in the trapping region on the thermal radiation emitted from the surface .",
    "the pair production rate is rather slow , but provided that it exceeds the loss rate , it can accumulate plasma near the lc in the cflr .",
    "note that reignition of a latent outer gap was discussed by @xcite in the context of gamma - ray bursts .",
    "however , they considered nearly aligned rotators with a period much shorter than that considered here . in their model , injection of externally - supplied particles in the outer gap",
    "is assumed to lead to efficient pair creation , a case that does not apply to rrats or magnetars .    in sec .",
    "2 , it is argued that plasma trapping regions similar to the earth s radiation belts can exist in the cflr of typical pulsars with a long period .",
    "injection of charged particles to the trapping region due to latent particle acceleration in an outer gap or direct ionization of accreted neutral dust grains is discussed in sec . 3 and 4 .",
    "5 discusses the stability of the pulsar radiation belts and possible mechanisms for particle precipitation .",
    "application to rrats is discussed in sec .",
    "it is argued here that radiation belts similar to that in planetary magnetospheres may exist in pulsar magnetospheres with relatively weak magnetic fields at the lc .",

    ", this corresponds to a particle remaining in the same landau level .",
    "the magnetic field in the cflr forms a ` magnetic bottle ' and particles injected at a radial height @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the radius in unit of @xmath7 ) can be trapped at @xmath8 provided that their perpendicular momenta satisfy the condition : @xmath9 where @xmath10 with @xmath11 the parallel momentum .",
    "for example , particles injected with @xmath12 at the lc ( @xmath13 ) can be trapped ; they bounce back and forth between two opposite hemispheres in the clfr above @xmath14 .",
    "the right - hand side can be written into the form @xmath15 , where the angle @xmath16 defines a conal surface in the momentum space , referred to as the loss cone at @xmath17 .",
    "particles with a pitch angle smaller than @xmath16 ( inside the cone ) pass through the point @xmath17 and those with a pitch angle larger than @xmath16 ( outside the cone ) are reflected above @xmath17 . for particles moving along the last closed field lines ,",

    "eq ( [ eq : ai ] ) is much smaller than the minimum loss - cone angle of the van allen belts in the earth s magnetosphere , which is a few degrees .",
    "however , it is shown in sec 2.2 that the minimum loss - cone angle determmined by cylcotron decay can be much larger than ( [ eq : ai ] ) .",
    "since the dipole magnetic field is inhomogeneous , the guiding centers of trapped particles undergo both a gradient drift and curvature drift across the field lines @xcite .",
    "these drifts cause particles to circulate around the star forming a ring current , similar to the ring current in the earth s radiation belts .",
    "the current gives rise to perturbations to the dipole field at @xmath21 : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the magnetic energy density at the lc , @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the half - opening angle of the pc , and @xmath26 is the gj density at the pc where the magnetic field is assumed to be @xmath27 . in practical situations where the plasma density can be much higher than the gj density ( sec 3 )",
    ", the perturbations can exceed the estimate given by ( [ eq : db ] ) . since the ring current can vary temporally as a result of instabilities in the trapped plasma ( cf .",
    "sec 5 ) , @xmath28 should be time dependent .",
    "the effect of such perturbations on pulsar electrodynamics and their possible contribution to pulsar timing noise will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "the lifetime of trapped particles is limited by cyclotron decay and pitch - angle scattering , both of which violate the first invariant . the electron s synchrotron cooling time , i.e. , the time that it loses half of its energy ( @xmath29 ) , is @xmath30 with @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the classical radius of the electron and @xmath33 is the electron cyclotron frequency .",

    "for fast rotating young pulsars or millisecond pulsars , ( [ eq : tau ] ) is very short @xmath35 , and for typical pulsars it can be quite long @xmath36 . since in the synchrotron regime , the pitch angle remains constant , the relevant time that constrains particle trapping is the cooling time in the limit @xmath37 , @xmath38^{1/2}$ ] @xcite , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the perpendicular and parallel components of the particle s dimensionless initial momentum .",
    "this gives @xmath41 , which has the following numerical form @xmath42 one has @xmath43 if a particle is injected into the trapping region with a large initial pitch angle @xmath44 .",

    ", the particle radiates at a much slower rate , relaxing to the ground landau state on a time @xmath46 .",
    "equating the cyclotron decay time to the bounce time , one finds the minimum pitch angle for a particle to be reflected at the mirror point .",

    "width=294 ]    pitch angle scattering by waves can lead to particle diffusion to small pitch angles and limit the life time of the trapped particles . since the decay time decreases rapidly with decreasing altitude according to @xmath51 , particles scattered to small pitch angles can reach low altitudes rapidly radiating away their perpendicular energy and eventually reach the star .",
    "for example , particles with @xmath52 , which are scattered into the loss cone of @xmath53 , can travel down to an altitude @xmath54 where the decay time is only @xmath55 .",
    "the sources of the waves can be internal , i.e. , they are generated _ in situ _ through plasma instabilities , or external , i.e. , they are generated outside the region .",
    "since particles with small pitch angles escape through both ends of the ` magnetic bottle ' , there is an excess of particles with a large pitch angle ; this gives rise to an ideal condition for instabilities to develop ( driven by an inversion in the particle pitch angle distribution ) .",
    "waves generated from instabilities can cause pitch angle diffusion , further enhancing particle precipitation . in principle , this process can impose an upper limit to the density of the trapped plasma @xcite .",
    "however , since the efficiency of pitch - angle scattering depends explicitly on the wave intensity that in this case is limited to much smaller than the density of the particle kinetic energy , one needs a relatively high plasma density for such upper limit to be significant ( cf .",
    "alternatively , pitch - angle scattering can be significant if waves that propagate into the region can interact with the trapped particles in resonance .",
    "this possibility is discussed in sec .",
    "particle loading into the trapping region can be achieved through a process that is not constrained by the first adiabatic invariant .",
    "we consider two possible sources for the trapped plasma , both of which involve extrinsic charged particles : ( 1 ) pair production in the trapping region by high - energy gamma rays emitted by particles accelerated in an outer gap and ( 2 ) direct ionization of neutral material in the thermal radiation field in the cflr .",
    "both cases may involve ionization of neutral matter migrating into the magnetosphere due to accretion of a disk @xcite or neutral dust grains in the ism @xcite .",
    "for ( 1 ) , the outer gap , which is usually dormant for typical pulsars , is reignited with the supply of charged particles .",

    "charged particles from the ionization can be accelerated through either inward ( toward the star ) cross - field diffusion or resonant wave - particle interactions , which is similar to the particle acceleration in the van allen belts in the earth s magnetosphere @xcite .    in principle , high - energy cosmic rays can also inject pairs into the trapping region .",
    "( note that cosmic rays contribute to trapped plasmas in the van allen belts through decay of upward deflected neutrons produced by high - energy cosmic rays . ) for example , cosmic protons with a gyroradius larger than @xmath56 can drift into the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "for a typical pulsar , the proton needs to have a lorentz factor @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the proton cyclotron frequency at the lc and @xmath59 .",
    "ultrarelativistic protons produce pairs on the thermal radiation through @xmath60 .",
    "however , it can be shown that such mechanism is not effective . assuming a typical proton flux density similar to that received on the earth , @xmath61 at @xmath62 , one finds a pair injection rate about @xmath63 .",
    "it would take much longer than the hubble time to fill the magnetosphere to the gj density .     along the last open field line is the outer gap where electrons are accelerated toward the star .",

    "disturbances to the region , such as alfvn waves launched from the star , can lead to an intense plasma precipitation .",

    "we show that a dormant outer gap can supply pairs to the trapping regions .",
    "it is generally thought an outer gap exists between the null surface and the boundary surface separating the oflr and the cflr @xcite . for young , fast rotating pulsars , particle acceleration in the outer gap can self - sustain a pair cascade , which can transfer a significant fraction of the gap potential into the secondary particles kinetic energy , which is then radiated at high energies . as the pulsar period increases ,",
    "the gap become less efficient in pair production and thus , for slow pulsars , pair production in the outer gap becomes negligible .",
    "however , provided that there is an external source of particles , the potential energy of such dormant gap can be tapped and transferred to plasma kinetic energy trapped in the cflr .      the accelerating electric field along the field lines in an outer gap can be written as a fraction of the maximum potential drop @xmath65 across the pc : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a parameter characterizing the geometry of the gap and @xmath68 . since pair production can change the gap geometry , the parameter @xmath69 is usually determined self - consistently by taking into account the effect on the accelerating potential by pair creation @xcite . as we consider here",

    ". pitch angle diffusion due to the fast mode waves in cerenkov resonance was discussed by  @xcite . since there is a nonzero @xmath183 along the mean magnetic field , fast particles in the cerenkov resonance bounce back and forth between two successive magnetic compressions ( acting as two magnetic mirrors ) in the wave frame . on average ,",
    "particles gain energy causing an increase in @xmath11 .",
    "this process , also called transit - time damping , works for a low alfvn speed @xmath184 , a condition not satisfied for pulsars .",
    "so , instead we consider a low frequency @xmath182 mode , which we refer to as the alfvn wave . in kinetic theory in the limit @xmath185 , which is appropriate for pulsar magnetopheric plasmas , alfvn waves have a nonzero @xmath186 along the magnetic field @xcite and particles can be accelerated through the cerenkov resonance @xcite .",
    "the scattering time @xmath187 may be written in terms of the ratio of the magnetic energy density @xmath188 of the wave to the plasma kinetic energy density @xmath189 ( appendix ) @xmath190 considering a plasma consisting of electrons and positrons , for @xmath191 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 and @xmath194 , one estimates @xmath195 .",
    "one concludes that diffusion due to particles in cerenkov resonance with a low frequency alfvn wave can effectively transfer particles to small pitch angles .",
    "it is appropriate to comment here that growth or damping of alfvn waves through the cerenkov resonance is generally not effective because the parallel component of the wave polarization is rather small , @xmath196 .",
    "thus , quasilinear diffusion as a result of such linear wave growth is not significant , limited by @xmath197 ( cf .",
    "[ eq : ta1 ] ) .",
    "this has been the main reason that such two - stage diffusion mechanism is not favored for the interpretation of cosmic - ray propagation , which , as inferred from observations , is subject to strong - pitch angle scattering in the ism @xcite .",
    "however , such limit is not applicable in our case as alfvn waves are assumed to be generated externally , not through the cerenkov resonance , with magnetic energy density comparable with @xmath198 ; thus , efficient diffusion occurs even for @xmath199 .",
    "disturbances to the radiation belt can be catastrophic if the wave that propagates to the region is in the form of short bursts producing @xmath191 in the trapping region . as shown from ( [ eq : ta1 ] ) , the scattering time can be as short as seconds .",
    "the requirement of @xmath191 is rather modest .",
    "for example , for @xmath200 , one has @xmath201 , giving a luminosity @xmath202 where @xmath203 is the pulse duration . as this luminosity is minuscule",
    "compared with transient emission in magnetars ( typically @xmath204 ) , these waves are not significant in producing high - energy emission .",
    "strong pitch angle diffusion channels most particles into the much smaller loss cone through which particles can reach a region close to the star where their synchrotron decay time is short .",
    "this can cause a sudden intense precipitation of particles on a time scale shorter than the pulsar period .",
    "one may estimate the required wave amplitude in terms of magnetic fluctuations as @xmath205 , implying low intensity quakes or oscillations would be sufficient for triggering disruption of the trapped plasma .    if the triggering mechanism is starquakes , the reoccurrence time of such particle storms is essentially the reoccurrence time of the quakes .",
    "the physics of neutron star quakes or oscillations is not well understood .",
    "a possibility is that a strong toroidal field exists in the crust underneath the surface and its stress can be released as quakes transfering the magnetic energy to the magnetosphere in alfvn waves @xcite .",
    "one expects that such starquakes are relatively more frequent for a high - field , young pulsar .",
    "if generation of low - intensity alfvn waves is so frequent that the reoccurrence time is much shorter than the pulsar period , trapped plasmas do not have enough time to accumulate and radiation belts may not form",
    ". this may be the case for magnetars with active transient emission .    )",
    "emitted from the surface can bounce back and forth in the closed magnetic flux tube interacting with the trapped particles .",
    "ls is the direction in which an observer would see the bursts arising from streaming instability as a result of downward moving particles .",
    "in contrast , bursts arising from cyclotron maser at reflection points can only be seen in the direction approximately perpendicular to the field lines.,width=302 ]",
    "an important consequence of the formation of pulsar radiation belts is transient emission  radio bursts that can be produced as particles precipitate and such transient emission may be relevant to rrats .",
    "rrats are bright radio bursts with a flux density up to a few jy at 1.4 ghz . as for normal radio pulses",
    ", the emission mechanism must be coherent .",
    "since there is no widely accepted mechanism for the pulsar radio emission , it is expected that many uncertainties would remain in identifying the specific emission mechanism for the transient case . nonetheless , in the following we consider two possibilities in particular : two - stream instability and cyclotron / synchrotron maser .",
    "the two - stream instability has been discussed extensively as a possible mechanism for pulsar radio emission , but the growth rate is not sufficient for the instability to develop in the polar region , mainly because of the very high lorentz factor of the primary particle beam @xcite . it is shown here that the plasma conditions created during the particle precipitation is favorable for such an instability to occur .",
    "two - stream instability can develop when particles traverse a corotating background plasma which is assumed to be stationary .",
    "assuming the precipitating plasma density is @xmath206 times the local gj density @xmath207 and the spread in the particle momentum distribution is ignored ( this spread can reduce the growth rate , cf discussion below ) .",
    "consider wave growth due to the cerenkov resonance @xmath208 .",
    "the characteristic frequency is determined by the denser plasma . for @xmath209 ,",
    "the characteristic frequency is the frequency @xmath210 of the stationary background , corotating plasma , with the backflowing plasma regarded as a weak beam satisfying the resonance condition .",
    "the growth rate is then estimated to be @xmath211 the growth rate reaches maximum at @xmath212 in the limit @xmath37 . for @xmath213 , the growth rate can be estimated in the rest frame of the backflowing plasma assuming that the corotating background plasma is a beam in cerenkov resonance .",
    "one finds @xmath214 where @xmath215 is the characteristic frequency seen in the pulsar frame .",
    "note that for two - stream instability in the polar cap model , the energetic particle beam is usually identified as those primary particles from the pc , with a lorentz factor as high as @xmath216 and instability is strongly suppressed @xcite . in the model discussed here",
    "@xmath217 is about a few and the growth rate ( [ eq : gamma2 ] ) or ( [ eq : gamma3 ] ) can be quite fast",
    ". for @xmath218 , @xmath219 , ( [ eq : gamma2 ] ) gives @xmath220 .",
    "although the growth rate can be reduced due to a spread in the particle momentum distribution , it seems that the instability can develop rapidly .",
    "it should be pointed out here that radio emission from two - stream instability is a two - stage process .",
    "the instability can generate langmuir waves which can in turn be converted to electromagnetic waves and at the same time facilitate the particle precipitation .      since particles with small pitch angles escape through the loss cone , particle precipitation creates an inversion in the pitch angle distribution of the upward flowing particles , driving cyclotron maser @xcite or synchrotron maser @xcite .",
    "this mechanism was discussed widely in interpretation of planetary radio bursts @xcite and solar bursts @xcite .",
    "synchrotron maser is applicable in the relativistic regime @xmath221 , while cyclotron maser may be the more relevant when such inversion occurs close to the star during the precipitation when their gyration is in the nonrelativistic regime .",
    "the relevant radio wave can grow when the frequency satisfies the cyclotron resonance condition . for cyclotron resonance at the fundmental harmonic @xmath222 ,",
    "the growth rate is given by @xcite @xmath223 where @xmath224 is the number density of particles in cyclotron resonance , and @xmath225 is the velocity of particles in cyclotron resonance . for a typical pulsar with @xmath226 and @xmath227",
    ", this condition can be satisfied at a radius @xmath228 .",
    "it is worth noting that the related but different process ",
    "cyclotron instability due to the anomalous doppler effect , which has been considered in the literature for pulsar radio emission @xcite , is not applicable here ; it requires an energetic beam ( @xmath229 ) of particles that satisfy the anomalous doppler condition .",
    "bursts produced from particle precipitation are characterized by sharp spikes . in the case of two - stream instability , since emission arising from the instability is confined to a thin shell region in the cflr near the last open field lines , one expects the beaming direction of the radio emission to be similar to that of reverse emission in the conventional polar cap models @xcite .",
    "consider a trapping region has a radial range from @xmath230 to @xmath56 .",
    "the inward tangent angles at @xmath17 are respectively given by @xmath231 and @xmath232 .",
    "one has a conal structure with an angular thickness as @xmath233 for @xmath234 . for the emission to be in radio ,",
    "the emission radius has to be @xmath235 , giving @xmath236 for @xmath237 .",
    "thus , the model predicts a rather narrow burst profile . since particle precipitation and subsequent burst emission can be highly localized and occurs over a large range of altitudes , such bursts can appear on a wide range of pulsar phase .    for cyclotron maser",
    ", the beam width is @xmath238 @xcite ; thus , the maser emission can produce narrow spiky profiles .",
    "since cyclotron maser emission occurs near particle reflection , the emission is beamed at a large angle to the field lines .",
    "this beaming feature is very different from the usual relativistic beaming ( @xmath239 ) along the field lines .",
    "such unsual beaming feature can be tested observationally if both bursts and weak emission ( i.e. , the usual pulsed emission ) can be detected and relative phase between the two components can be determined .",
    "propagation of radio emission in the cflr is constrained by induced scattering by electrostatic waves excited by the radio emission itself @xcite . assuming a brightness temperature @xmath240 and a beaming solid angle @xmath241 ,",
    "one may define a radius of an opaque sphere @xcite , @xmath242 such that the wave with a frequency @xmath243 can only propagate outside the sphere @xmath244 . here",
    "we assume that the plasma density in the propagation path is the local gj density .",
    "although @xmath245 is not well constrained , the condition ( [ eq : rcr ] ) is quite robust . for an observed flux density @xmath246 and a pulsar distance @xmath247 , the brightness temperature times",
    "the beaming solid angle can be estimated from @xmath248 where @xmath249 is the distance between the scattering region and the emission region . in the case of inward emission due to two - stream instability , ( [ eq : rcr ] ) gives a lower limit to the emission radius ; for the emission to be potentially visible , the emission radius must be @xmath250 @xcite .",
    "we consider possible existence of transient radiation belts in the magnetospheres of pulsars with low lc magnetic fields .",
    "it is suggested that particle acceleration in latent outer gaps can lead to creation of pairs with large pitch angles in the cflrs near the lc where they are trapped due to the magnetic mirror effect . in the trapping regions where the magnetic fields are weak ( @xmath251 )",
    ", particles radiate away their perpendicular energy over a time much longer than a typical pulsar period .",
    "thus , the plasma density can build up over a synchrotron cooling time , which is much longer than the pulsar period .",
    "similar to the planetary radiation belts , pulsar radiation belts can be disrupted due to disturbances of waves propagating into the regions .",
    "catastrophic disruption of these regions may lead to intense particle precipitation , which in turn generates radio bursts that can be seen as radio transients .",
    "the main triggering mechanism is scattering of trapped particles into a loss cone as a result of interactions with waves generated in plasma instabilities in the trapping regions or alfvn waves emitted at the surface due to low - intensity starquakes or oscillations .",
    "the plasma that rushes through the background corotating plasma can produce bursts of coherent radio emission through streaming instability or cylcotron / synchrotron maser .",
    "existence of such radiation belts , if observationally confirmed , would imply that some of the bursty phenomena of pulsar radio emission may be due to particle precipitation .",
    "in particular , we suggest that such transient radio emission may be seen as rrats .",
    "a notable feature of our model , as applied to rrats , is that in comparison with conventional polar cap models , the transient emission mechanism considered here is less constrained by the pair production efficiency ; it predicts that pulsars below the ` deathline ' can still produce radio bursts .",
    "one of the major problems with polar cap models is the low efficiency of pair production .",
    "most rrats have long periods and for pulsars with such long periods , there is insufficient supply of pairs needed for coherent emission .",
    "although an outer gap can supply additional pairs through acceleration of charged particles supplied externally @xcite , the pair production efficiency is too low to produce a substantial downflow of pairs ; the only possible location for reverse emission in the polar regions is near or in the polar gap where a downward pair cascade can occur ; for example , externally - supplied particles flush the polar gap resulting in a downward transient pair cascade followed by quenching of the gap @xcite .",
    "however , such a scenario would predict an emission region very close to the star and any reverse emission may be eclipsed by either the star or a dense plasma near the surface . in our model , since particle precipitation occurs in the cflr , it does not quench the polar gap , allowing the possibility of observing both burst and normal radio emission .    in application to magnetars with active high - energy transient emission ,",
    "one expects low - intensity quakes to occur much more frequently than in normal pulsars @xcite .",
    "such frequent disruption may prevent a radiation belt forming in a magnetar magnetosphere , even though the synchrotron decay time is relatively long near the lc .",
    "this scenario seems to be supported by lack of any detection of rrat - like radio bursts from the known magnetars .",
    "although transient radio emission was recently detected from the magnetar xte j1810@xmath123197 , polarization study suggests that the emission geometry resembles that of young pulsars @xcite .    in principle , our model may also apply to old , long - period pulsars .",
    "the loading time @xmath158 can be significantly longer than the synchrotron decay time .",
    "the plasma trapping can be due to _ in situ _ ionization of the accreted neutral grains in the cflr .",
    "since the synchrotron decay time is long , for example , @xmath252 for psr j2144@xmath1233933 with @xmath253 and @xmath254 , a nearby long - period pulsar , accumulation of plasma can occur over a long time ( provided that the reoccurrence time of the triggering mechanism is also long ) . since old pulsars are not energetic , the predicted radio luminosity is low . as it takes a long time to replenish the trapped plasma , such transient events can be rather infrequent but may still be detectable provided these pulsars are located relatively nearby .",
