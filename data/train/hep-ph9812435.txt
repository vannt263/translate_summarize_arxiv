    "pair production of @xmath3 bosons is one of the new physics processes to be studied at lep2 and at future high energy @xmath2 colliders .",
    "although it is a process with a rather low cross section ( below 1 pb ) and experimentally difficult to observe ( large and almost irreducible backgrounds ) , lep2 gives the first opportunity to perform a measurement and to look for deviations from the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "in addition , a good understanding of the process is necessary , since it is one of the relevant backgrounds in the search for the higgs particle . at future @xmath2 colliders , with luminosities of the order of 100",
    ", several thousands of events will provide stringent tests of the sm .",
    "the study of triple - gauge boson couplings is one of the key issues at present and future colliders .",
    "anomalous @xmath4 couplings have been searched for at the tevatron and at lep @xcite .",
    "the first experimental limits on anomalous @xmath5 couplings have been provided by the l3 collaboration @xcite .",
    "the report is organized as follows .",
    "first , the sm amplitude is presented and the effects of possible anomalous zzv couplings at lep2 and at future @xmath2 colliders are discussed .",
    "second , we describe two reweighting approaches developed for the search for anomalous couplings at lep2 . these approaches are compared and their differences are pointed out . finally , the fitting techniques used to quantify the possible presence of anomalous couplings are briefly presented .",
    "the diagrams contributing at first order to the @xmath7 process in the standard model are shown in figure [ fig : zzsm ] .",
    "we will assume a collision in the center - of - mass system with total energy @xmath8 and neglect the effect of the electron mass .",
    "the following notation is used :    * electron four - momentum @xmath9 and helicity @xmath10 : * * @xmath11 * * @xmath12 * positron four - momentum @xmath13 and helicity @xmath14 : * * @xmath15 * * @xmath16 * @xmath3 four - momentum @xmath17 and polarization @xmath18 : * * @xmath19 ; @xmath20 * * @xmath21 ; @xmath22 * @xmath3 four - momentum @xmath23 and polarization @xmath24 : * * @xmath25 ; @xmath26 * * @xmath27 ; @xmath28    where the electron is assumed to collide along the + z axis ( @xmath29 ) , and the @xmath3 -with mass @xmath30- goes along the direction given by @xmath31 .",
    "the masses @xmath30 and @xmath32 are not assumed to be equal to the on - shell mass @xmath33 because in the following they will be consider as virtual particles decaying into fermions .",
    "the matrix element for the @xmath7 reaction is determined by the same method followed in @xcite .",
    "it reads : @xmath34\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the functions @xmath35 are given by : @xmath36    where the components of the four - vectors are denoted by superscripts .",
    "the left / right effective couplings of fermions to neutral gauge bosons are given by : @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the charge of the fermion @xmath39 in units of the charge of the positron , and the electromagnetic coupling constant @xmath40 is evaluated at the scale of the virtual photon mass @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 is the third component of the weak isospin ( @xmath43 ) , @xmath44 is the effective value of the square of the sine of the weinberg angle and @xmath45 is the value of the fermi coupling constant .",
    "the effective couplings to the z absorb the relevant electroweak radiative corrections at the scale of the z @xcite .",
    "they are obtained by the substitutions : @xmath46    the experimental signature of a @xmath0 process is a final state with four fermions , due to the unstability of the @xmath3 particle .",
    "a distinctive feature is that the invariant masses of the two pairs , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , peak at the z mass @xmath33 .",
    "the angular distribution of the decay products keeps information on the average polarization of the @xmath3 boson .",
    "in addition , the @xmath3 decay amplitude has to be included for a correct treatment of spin correlations . assuming that fermion masses are negligible compared with @xmath33 , this amplitude is given in the rest frame of the @xmath3 by : @xmath49 \\\\    & & \\nonumber \\\\ v_1 & = & \\left(0 , \\cos\\theta_f \\cos\\phi_f , \\cos\\theta_f \\sin\\phi_f ,         -\\sin\\theta_f \\right ) \\\\",

    "anomalous gauge boson couplings lead to interactions of the type shown in figure [ fig : zzanom ] .",
    "the coupling @xmath53 , with @xmath54 or @xmath55 , does not exist in the standard model at tree level .",
    "only two anomalous couplings are possible if the @xmath3 bosons in the final state are on - shell , due to bose - einstein symmetry . in principle , five more couplings should be considered if at least one of the @xmath3 bosons is off - shell . however , as discussed in appendix [ app : a ] , the new terms must be of higher dimensionality and are suppressed by orders of @xmath56 , where @xmath57 denotes a scale related to new physics .",
    "we will concentrate on the most general expression of the anomalous vertex function at lowest order @xcite : @xmath58      + i f_5^v~\\epsilon^{\\alpha\\beta\\mu\\rho}~            ( q_{\\mathrm { z_1}}-q_{\\mathrm { z_2}})_\\rho     \\left . \\right\\ } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    a non - zero value of @xmath59 leads to a c - violating , cp - violating process , while terms associated to @xmath60 are p - violating , cp - conserving . using",
    "again the formalism followed in @xcite we obtain the explicit expressions for the anomalous contributions : @xmath61 \\\\",

    "all anomalous contributions increase with the center - of - mass energy of the collision .",
    "we want to bring the attention to the fact that these anomalous @xmath63 couplings are different from those considered in the @xmath64 anomalous process @xcite .",
    "therefore , not only the two anomalous @xmath5 couplings , but all four anomalous parameters remain essentially unconstrained at present .",
    "anomalous @xmath53 couplings manifest in three ways :    * a change in the observed total cross section @xmath0 . * a modification of the angular distribution of the @xmath3 . * a change in the average polarization of the @xmath3 bosons .",
    "the effect of anomalous couplings in the @xmath0 process at born level is illustrated in figures  [ fig : angdis ] and  [ fig : lc_angdis ] for the center - of - mass energies of @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "the anomalous distributions are determined for the values @xmath67 . both cp - violating and p - violating couplings are found to produce a global enhancement in the number of events .",
    "this increase is very clear at @xmath66 .",
    "there are moderate changes in the angular shape at @xmath65 . at @xmath66",
    "the situation is different .",
    "the copious anomalous production at large polar angles starts to compensate the huge peaks of the sm differential cross section at low polar angles .",
    "the sm divergent behaviour happens in the limit @xmath68 , where the process tends to a t - channel process with production of massless bosons .",
    "anomalous couplings also modify the average polarizations of the @xmath3 bosons , as shown in figures  [ fig : polz ] ,  [ fig : polg ] and  [ fig : lc_pol ] . at @xmath65",
    "the observed change depends on the particular size and type of the anomalous coupling under consideration . for cp - violating couplings",
    "there is always an increase of the production of bosons with different polarizations ( longitudinal versus transverse ) . at @xmath66",
    "all couplings show a similar behaviour : an enhancement of longitudinal - transverse production and a suppression of transverse - transverse production .",
    "this is an interesting feature , since the sm process has the opposite behaviour .",
    "the fraction of states in which the two bosons are longitudinally polarized is below @xmath69 at these energies , both for sm and for anomalous production .",
    "what is physically observable is a modification of the angular distributions in the center - of - mass frame of the @xmath70 decays : in absence of anomalous couplings , both @xmath3 decays will proceed preferentially along the direction of the @xmath3 momenta , whereas one of the decays will preferentially occur at @xmath71 if the process is highly anomalous .",
    "summarizing , at energies close to the threshold of @xmath72 production the sensitivity to anomalous couplings is weak . for an integrated luminosity of 200 ,",
    "tens of events are expected to be selected .",
    "the main anomalous effect is an increase in the cross section , and one expects small improvements from the variations in the angular distributions . at higher energies , with luminosities of the order of 100 , all anomalous effects contribute coherently to enhance the sensitivity : a huge increase in the cross section , especially at large polar angles , and a clear correlation between the angular distributions of the @xmath3 decay products .",
    "in order to take into account anomalous effects with sufficient accuracy , the correct matrix element structure has to be implemented . in many cases , and from the practical point of view",
    ", the generation of events for different values of anomalous couplings is not convenient .",
    "a more attractive method is to set up a procedure to obtain the monte carlo anomalous distributions as a function of a single set of generated events .",
    "this is the role of reweighting methods .",
    "let us consider a set of events generated according to the standard model differential cross section .",
    "new distributions taking into account the anomalous couplings are obtained when every event is reweighted by the factor : @xmath73    the weight @xmath74 depends on the helicities of the initial electron ( @xmath10 ) and of the final fermions ( @xmath75,@xmath76 ) .",
    "it also depends on the kinematic variables defining the phase space ( @xmath77 ) . for convenience",
    "we choose the following set :    * the invariant masses of the @xmath47 and @xmath48 systems : @xmath30 , @xmath32 .",
    "* the polar and azimuthal angles of the @xmath47 system : @xmath78 , @xmath79 . * the polar and azimuthal angles of the fermion @xmath39 after a lorentz boost to the rest frame of the @xmath47 system :",
    "@xmath80 , @xmath81 . * the polar and azimuthal angles of the fermion @xmath82 after a lorentz boost to the rest frame of the @xmath48 system :",
    "@xmath83 , @xmath84 .",
    "the previous result can be extended to take into account other non - resonant diagrams like @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "these diagrams can not be neglected for a correct analysis of double z resonant production  @xcite .",
    "the final weight is : @xmath87    where a sum on all intermediate @xmath88 is assumed .",
    "the propagator factors @xmath89 are defined as follows : @xmath90    where the imaginary component takes into account the energy dependence of the @xmath3 width around the resonance .",
    "the expressions for @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 are obtained by the same method used for @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "explicitly , they can be obtained by substituting @xmath3 by @xmath96 where necessary : @xmath97    weights according to @xmath98 have been implemented in a fortran program .",
    "the approach is well suited for events generated with the pythia @xmath99 generator @xcite .",
    "this implementation will be identified as the `` nc08 approach '' , because all eight neutral conversion diagrams are considered .",
    "several checks have been done in order to make sure that the calculations are correct .",
    "there is also agreement with the results obtained in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "after reweighting , distributions according to given values of the anomalous couplings @xmath100 are obtained .",
    "detector effects are correctly taken into account if events are reweighted at generator level .",
    "there are several references providing valuable information on the @xmath0 process .",
    "a specific sm generator for @xmath101 without anomalous couplings exists in pythia @xcite .",
    "the calculation reported in the previous section is well suited for this mc generator , but initial state radiation effects ( isr ) need to be taken into account .",
    "we assume that the differential cross section can be expressed as follows : @xmath102    where @xmath103 is the ( undressed ) cross section evaluated at a scale @xmath104 , and @xmath105 is the cross section after inclusion of isr effects .",
    "the radiator factor @xmath106 is a `` universal '' radiator , that is , independent of specific details of the matrix element . with this assumption",
    "isr effects are accounted for by evaluating the matrix element in the center - of - mass system of the four fermions , at the corresponding scale @xmath104 .    in reference",
    "@xcite a specific @xmath107 generator for anomalous couplings studies is presented .",
    "it takes into account isr effects with the yfs approach @xcite up to @xmath108 leading - log .",
    "it has some limitations , like the absence of conversion diagrams mediated by virtual photons .",
    "the standard model cross section ( @xmath109 ) from @xcite shows agreement at the percent level with the one determined in reference @xcite , where it is shown that all significant radiation effects come from `` universal '' radiator factors .",
    "this implies that an approach based on equation [ eq : radiator ] is justified in terms of the required precision .",
    "additional non - resonant diagrams are taken into account in sm programs for general four - fermion production , like excalibur @xcite . under a reasonable set of kinematic cuts ,",
    "the relative influence of those diagrams can be reduced , but not totally suppressed .",
    "this is due to the low cross section for resonant zz production .",
    "typical examples are those involving charged currents ( relevant in @xmath111 , @xmath112 ,  ) or multiperipheral effects in @xmath113 . in addition",
    ", the influence of fermi correlations in final states with identical fermions ( @xmath114 ) is unclear .    in order to include these effects ,",
    "the excalibur program has been extended .",
    "all matrix elements from conversion diagrams with two virtual z particles @xmath115 are modified in the following way : @xmath116    where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are the same terms defined in the nc08 approach . based on this modification",
    "it is straightforward to define an alternative reweighting .",
    "it will be identified as the `` full approach '' in the following .",
    "more detailed studies are reported in the next section .",
    "all checks presented in this section require a precise definition of a `` @xmath72 signal '' .",
    "channels involving electron or electronic neutrino pairs in the final state have a non - negligible contribution from non - conversion diagrams .",
    "also final states with fermions from the same isospin doublet ( @xmath119,(u , d),(c , s ) ) show a non - negligible charged current contribution .",
    "therefore stringent cuts must be applied in order to select a sensible @xmath0 experimental signal .",
    "our signal definition implies the following cuts :    * the invariant masses of the two fermion - antifermion candidate pairs must be in the range 70 gev-105 gev . * in the final states with electrons , these electrons must verify @xmath120 . * in the final states with ww contributions , the invariant masses of the fermion pairs susceptible to come from w decay must be outside the range 75 gev-85 gev .",
    "the sm cross sections within signal definition cuts at @xmath121 are shown in figure  [ fig : nc08_vs_exc ] for the different four - fermion channels .",
    "the excalibur generator is used .",
    "two determinations are shown : one taking into account all the standard model diagrams and the other considering the neutral conversion diagrams only . note that , in some cases , there are large differences between the two calculations .",
    "this already points to the convenience of using a full four - fermion approach , even in the presence of strong cuts .",
    "the next study is devoted to the sm matrix elements .",
    "for the same set of neutral conversion diagrams , the results obtained by excalibur and by the nc08 approach are compared .",
    "the relative differences are shown in figure  [ fig : matrixel ] .",
    "two groups are considered .",
    "the first group corresponds to all processes without fermi correlations , that is , those in which there are no identical fermions in the final state .",
    "a perfect agreement is observed in this case .",
    "the second group contains those processes in which there are identical particles in the final state .",
    "let us note that no effort has been done in the nc08 approach to antisymmetrize the matrix element in the presence of identical fermions .",
    "although the effect is understood and it can be trivially included , we want to show that it is not totally negligible .",
    "it may exceed @xmath122 for some phase space configurations .",
    "figure [ fig : check2 ] shows the distribution of weights at @xmath65 for non - zero values of the anomalous couplings .",
    "the fact that the distributions are not extremely narrow indicates the presence of effects other than just an excess of events . to compare the implementations in the presence of anomalous couplings",
    ", the standard model distributions are reweighted according to the nc08 and full approaches . again",
    ", only neutral conversion diagrams are considered .",
    "the relative differences between the weights assigned by the two approaches are shown in figure  [ fig : check3 ] .",
    "there is agreement at the percent level .",
    "fermi correlations in the final state have a small effect on the weights .",
    "the reason could be related to the fact that the discrepancy factorizes in a similar way sm and anomalous terms .",
    "the last study evaluates the influence of non - conversion diagrams in the presence of anomalous couplings .",
    "the averages of the reweighting factors for the full and the nc08 approaches are compared in tables  [ tab : fz]- [ tab : fg ] .",
    "the set of cuts defining the zz resonant region is applied in all cases .",
    "the differences are typically below 10% , but not negligible .",
    "this points again to the convenience of considering all possible diagrams contributing to the @xmath123 process .",
    "to determine the values of the anomalous couplings from the data , the histogram of the most relevant variable for each four - fermion channel may be used . the following binned likelihood function",
    "is then maximized : @xmath126\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the expected number of events is computed as : @xmath127 . the background contribution does not depend on the anomalous couplings .",
    "the signal contribution includes all four - fermion final states compatible with the exchange of two @xmath3 bosons .",
    "it is computed by reweighting the standard model distributions with the full approach and taking into account the @xmath128 values of the anomalous couplings .",
    "this method has been applied in the analysis of @xmath123 final states by the l3 collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the discriminating variables are the invariant masses of the lepton pairs in leptonic decays and neural net outputs for hadronic decays .",
    "they obtain the following 95% confidence level limits on the existence of anomalous @xmath72v couplings : @xmath129    as an example of the use of more sensitive variables at higher energies we will consider the semileptonic process @xmath130 at @xmath66 .",
    "this channel is expected to provide a clean signature for @xmath72 production if the higgs mass is away from the z mass region . in order to enhance the zz signal component ,",
    "the invariant mass of the leptons is required to be in the 70 gev to 150 gev range , the recoiling hadronic mass has to be larger than 50 gev and the polar angle of electrons and positrons , @xmath131 , must satisfy @xmath132 .",
    "the differential cross section of the process in the presence of an anomalous coupling @xmath133 can be expressed as follows :    @xmath134    the variables @xmath135 and @xmath136 are functions of the phase space variables of an event .",
    "they are independent of @xmath133 .",
    "the previous equation guarantees that the maximal information on @xmath133 is obtained by a study of the event density as a function of the variables @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "these variables are usually called `` optimal observables '' .",
    "given an event characterized by the phase space point @xmath77 , a simple expression for the optimal observables is :    @xmath137    where @xmath138 is the reweighting factor used to transform sm distributions into anomalous distributions at @xmath77 for an anomalous coupling @xmath133 . at @xmath66 and for small values of @xmath133",
    "the dominant term in the zz differential cross section is the one associated to @xmath135 . in real life , the exact values of the phase space variables are unknown , but we may use as an approximation the phase space variables reconstructed by the detector . for this exercise",
    "we assume energy resolutions of @xmath139 for quarks and leptons and a jet angular resolution of 40 mrad .",
    "the weight is symmetrized under the interchange of quark types , assuming that the quark flavour can not be identified .",
    "the sm distribution of the variable @xmath135 for an integrated luminosity of 100 is shown in figure [ fig : oo1 ] , together with the effect of an anomalous coupling @xmath140 .",
    "note that the ratio between the anomalous and the sm distributions is not constant .",
    "this is a demonstration of the sensitivity of the variable and of the existence of anomalous effects different from a simple change in the total cross section . from a likelihood fit to the anomalous distribution",
    "we obtain a value of @xmath141 .",
    "note the increase in sensitivity as compared to lep2 present limits .",
    "we would like to thank j. biebel and a. felbrich for useful discussions and cross - checks .",
    "we are also grateful to r. pittau for providing the last version of the excalibur program for l3 .",
    "we specially thank the help , positive criticism and support from our l3-zz collaborators during this time .",
    "the most general lorentz invariant anomalous coupling structure for the @xmath53 vertex function is , similarly to the wwv case @xcite : @xmath142    the global factor @xmath143 is introduced by convention   in the denominator is arbitrary .",
    "it allows the introduction of a dimensionless coupling constant without adding new unknown scale parameters .",
    "a physically more motivated choice is to substitute @xmath33 by a scale of new physics @xmath57 . in this way ,",

    "note that only the terms associated to @xmath59 and @xmath60 survive in the limit in which both @xmath3 are on - shell .",
    "the @xmath53 vertex function must be symmetric under the interchange @xmath146 . for the terms associated to @xmath147 and @xmath148 this requirement forces the presence of an additional lorentz invariant factor : any antisymmetric function of @xmath149 .",
