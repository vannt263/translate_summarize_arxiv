    "the realization of quantum information transport between remote parties is of central importance for any scalable quantum information processing . to this end ,",
    "one straightforward approach is to use quantum channels to connect these spatially separated parties .",
    "owing to high speed transmission and negligible interaction with the environment , in the form of flying qubits , photons are the natural candidates for long - distance quantum communication @xcite .",
    "alternatively , for short - distance quantum communication inside a quantum computer , the majority of promising channels rely upon the use of solid - state - based devices , including nuclear spins in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) @xcite , electron spins of nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) colour centers in diamond @xcite , and flux qubits in superconductors @xcite . moreover , coupled - resonator arrays ( cras ) , being currently explored in various physical systems such as superconducting transmission line resonators @xcite , toroidal microresonators @xcite and plasmonic nanoparticle arrays @xcite , have been attracted much attention in recent years .",
    "a particular advantage of such arrays is the full addressability of individual resonators , which allows each of the resonators to act as a quantum network node @xcite . indeed , utilizing these cras of having the same fundamental hardware to process quantum information can also avoid a quantum interface between the quantum register and the quantum channel .",
    "in addition to offering an effective platform to simulate quantum many - body phenomena such as mott - superfluid and topological effects @xcite , the cras have been previously considered for controllable transport of photons by making use of the photon - atom scattering @xcite . despite such substantial developments , prior work on controllable photon transport",
    "has typically focused upon either single photons @xcite or nearby cras @xcite .",
    "however , the ability to transport multiphoton quantum states is a key requirement for encoding a high - dimensional hilbert space , which is applicable , for example , to universal quantum computation @xcite ; at the same time , quantum information stored in the multiphoton fields needs to be controllably transported between two distant quantum registers to carry out quantum network operations . for these reasons , developing a quantum channel capable of controllably transporting multiphoton states is thus of both fundamental and practical importance .    in this paper",
    ", we propose and analyze a multiphoton controllable transport protocol , where we use an auxiliary resonator coupled to one resonator of a coupled - resonator chain , which serves as a quantum channel to connect two remote resonators .",
    "the physical essence underlying our method is that this auxiliary resonator is employed to control the coherent long - range interaction between the two boundary resonators . to be specific , in the case when the auxiliary resonator is absent , the two boundary resonators could be only coupled to a specific eigenmode of the intermediate chain , within the weak - coupling regime . in this case , the time evolution can swap arbitrary bosonic quantum states of the two boundary resonators , yielding an effective photon transport channel ( eptc ) . on the contrary ,",
    "when the auxiliary resonator is coupled to the intermediate chain , the specific eigenmode could be split , such that the two boundary resonators are decoupled from the intermediate chain in the large - detuning limit .",
    "photons are therefore reflected back , remaining unchanged .",
    "as opposed to prior work , the proposed model is capable of controlling the coherent transport of an arbitrary multiphoton quantum state between two distant resonators over an arbitrarily long range .",
    "the basic idea of our protocol is schematically illustrated in fig . [ fig1](a ) . to begin , we consider a quantum channel consisting of a coupled - resonator chain of @xmath0 resonators , with a hamiltonian @xmath1 where @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) represents the annihilation ( creation ) operator acting on the resonator @xmath4 and obeys a boson commutation relation @xmath5=\\delta_{ij}$ ] , and @xmath6 is the coupling constant between the nearest - neighbor resonators .",
    "two distant resonators , labelled @xmath7 and @xmath8 , are coupled to the ends of the quantum channel , and the interaction hamiltonian is correspondingly given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the coupling strength between the two boundary resonators and the intermediate chain . in order to control the multiphoton coherent transport ,",
    "we introduce an auxiliary control resonator , labelled @xmath11 , to interact with the @xmath12-th resonator of the quantum channel through @xmath13 with a coupling strength @xmath14 . here",
    ", we have assumed that all resonators have a common frequency @xmath15 , and the system is transformed into a frame rotating at @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , the total hamiltonian governing the system is @xmath16 .     and",

    "to achieve multiphoton transport , we introduce an auxiliary resonator , labelled @xmath11 , to interact with the @xmath12-th resonator of the intermediate chain , with strength @xmath14 .",
    "( b ) in uncoupled case of @xmath17 , the intermediate chain could , under the assumption that @xmath18 , coherently couple the two spatially separated resonators , such that photons are transported between the two boundary resonators after the time evolution .",

    "<S> an arbitrary multiphoton quantum state can be either transmitted through or reflected off the intermediate chain on demand , with very high fidelity . </S>",
    "<S> we find , on using a time - independent perturbative treatment , that quantum information leakage of an arbitrary fock state is limited by two upper bounds , one for the transmitted case and the other for the reflected case . in principle , the two upper bounds can be made arbitrarily small , which is confirmed by numerical simulations . </S>"
