    "efficient , accurate codes are needed for the computation of nuclear cross sections due to the large number of nuclear reactions that occur at these energies .",
    "the lippmann - schwinger ( ls ) equation is an expression for the scattering transition amplitude @xcite .",
    "scattering amplitudes can be obtained by either solving the ls equation or by employing some approximation , such as the eikonal method .",
    "the elastic differential cross section is computed from the absolute square of the scattering amplitude , and the total cross section is related to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude .",
    "the elastic cross section is obtained by performing the angular integration of the elastic differential cross section , and the reaction cross section is found from the difference between the total and elastic cross sections .",
    "the input into the elastic scattering equation is the optical potential , which can be expressed in an infinite series of nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) transition amplitudes , @xmath1 .",
    "if the transition matrix is written for ground states of the projectile and target , then , in the factorization approximation , the optical potential is proportional to @xmath1 and the nuclear densities of the projectile and target @xcite .",

    "the internal charge structure of the proton is not taken into account in this analysis ; instead , nucleons are treated as point particles .",
    "harmonic well densities are typically used for lighter nuclei because of the gaussian - like decay of the nuclear charge density as a function of radial distance .",
    "wood - saxon densities , also known as two - parameter and three - parameter fermi densities , are better suited for heavier nuclei , where the nuclear charge density is relatively constant before decreasing to zero at larger radial distances .",
    "the two most common ways of solving the ls equation are to use the eikonal approximation or the method of partial wave ( pw ) decomposition @xcite .",
    "the eikonal approximation was first introduced by moliere and systematically developed by glauber in the treatment of many - body nuclear reactions with a quantum collision theory of composite objects @xcite .",
    "the eikonal approximation can be derived by assuming high energy and small angle scattering , which leads to a linearized propagator in the ls equation from which the eikonal scattering wave function may be obtained @xcite .",
    "the scattering amplitude is determined from eikonal phase factor , which is a function of the the optical potential @xcite .    besides being an approximation",
    ", a drawback of the eikonal approximation is that it may be numerically inefficient for the evaluation of the cross sections for a given optical potential . in the position - space representation , the optical potential , @xmath2 ,",
    "is given by a 6-dimensional integration for heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "therefore , the eikonal phase factor depends on a 6-dimensional integral in the position representation of the optical potential and an additional integration variable over a coordinate in the scattering plane .",
    "the numerical integration over 7-dimensions in the position space representation is inefficient when an analytic expression of the optical potential is not known .",
    "it is desirable to use exact formulas for the optical potential when analytic expressions of the optical potential can be found .",
    "the current work implements expressions of the optical potential for nucleon - nucleus ( na ) and nucleus - nucleus ( aa ) scattering utilizing harmonic well nuclear matter densities for light nuclei ( @xmath0 ) , and the optical potential is expressed in momentum space for cases where no analytic expression can be found ( @xmath3 ) @xcite .",
    "the ls equation may also be solved via the method of partial wave decomposition @xcite , where the transition amplitude is expanded in an infinite series of functions of relative momenta and angular dependent spherical harmonics or legendre polynomials . after integrating over the angular dependence ,",
    "the transition amplitude is solved for a given partial wave .",
    "once the partial wave solutions are found , the full solution for the transition amplitude is found by re - summing the series , which is terminated when some pre - defined tolerance of precision is reached .",
    "the pw method is known to become numerically unstable for reactions that require many partial waves @xcite , which is not only limited to high energy na reactions ( gev / n ) but also includes aa reactions at relatively low energy per nucleon ( hundreds of mev / n ) .",
    "the numerical instability can be traced back to highly oscillating legendre polynomials in the pw expansion and large on - shell momenta for elastic reactions , where contributions to the transition amplitude tend to be localized .",
    "although there are numerical limitations associated with the pw method , the full three - dimensional lippmann - schwinger ( ls3d ) solution method circumvents the necessity of using highly oscillating legendre polynomials @xcite .",
    "most of the ls3d studies have consisted of nn interactions @xcite with the exception of rodriguez  gallardo et al .",
    "@xcite who studied na and aa reactions at relatively low energies and liu et al .",
    "@xcite who studied three - body reactions .",

    "n to 20 gev / n .",
    "the eikonal method is a non - relativistic approximation ; however , when energies become sufficiently high , relativistic effects will be manifested in the elastic differential cross section .",
    "relativistic kinematics are needed for high energy reactions and are easily incorporated into the momentum space - representation of the pw and ls3d equations , where the momentum is simply a number instead of a spatial derivative operator , as in the position space - representation . at relativistic energies , the pw and ls3d models will agree if convergence of the partial wave solution is reached , but both methods should differ from the eikonal results , which are non - relativistic . in the low energy limit , the eikonal method should break down and begin to diverge from the pw and ls3d results , since small angle scattering is not appropriate for such reactions . to examine the effect of kinematics ,",
    "model results are compared for various nuclear reactions at relativistic and non - relativistic energies .    at relativistic energies , the inner structure of the nucleons may be probed . the multiple scattering theory ( mst ) upon which the model of interaction is based and the nn transition amplitude do not account for the inner structure of the nucleons . the complications associated with the inner structure of the nucleons are assumed to be included in the parameterizations to experimental nn transition amplitudes .    in this paper ,",
    "exact formulas of the optical potential in the position space representation are used for light nuclei ( @xmath4 ) , and the momentum - space representation of the eikonal phase factor is used for heavier nuclei .",
    "the pw and ls3d methods are solved with non - relativistic and relativistic kinematics , and comparisons of the models are made for reactions that are relevant to space radiation .",
    "based on the results presented herein , it is recommended that the ls3d method be used for high energy na reactions and aa reactions at all energies because of its rapid numerical convergence and stability .",
