    "electrodynamics in general relativity is described by the maxwell equations in curved space - time @xcite .",
    "a freely falling observer in such background would write the same equations valid for minkowski space - time ; however , these equations must have a different solution , because the curved geometry imposes a different asymptotic behavior than the flat one .",
    "in particular , the electric field around a static point charge in a curved background is not spherically symmetric in general , and this has the consequence of a so - called electrostatic self - force on the charge .",
    "one of the earliest studies on the electrostatic self - force on static charges induced by a curved background was that on a black hole geometry .",
    "it was shown that the self - force on a charge @xmath0 is repulsive , i.e. it points outwards from the black hole , and that it has the dependence f~ , where @xmath1 is the mass of the source and @xmath2 is the schwarzschild radial coordinate of the charge .",
    "this result was first obtained within the framework of linearized general relativity @xcite , and was later recovered working within the full theory @xcite . after the publication of these leading works the study of the self - interaction of a charge",
    "was extended to other geometries .",
    "a notable result was the self - force on a charge in the vicinity of a straight cosmic string arising from symmetry breaking in a system composed by a complex scalar field coupled to a gauge field @xcite .",
    "the associated geometry is locally flat but includes a deficit angle determined by @xmath3 , the mass per unit length of the string @xcite .",
    "the self - force in this case points outwards from the cosmic string and is proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "this non null self - force in a locally flat background is of great interest because it shows how the global properties of a manifold ( in this case , the existence of a deficit angle ) are revealed by the electromagnetic field of the charge .",
    "in fact , these results together with the calculation of the self - force on a point charge in a wormhole space - time @xcite , which turned out to be attractive , i.e. towards the wormhole throat , suggested the possibility of detecting thin - shell wormholes by means of electrostatics . differing from well - known wormholes of the morris ",
    "thorne type @xcite which are supported by non localized exotic matter , thin - shell wormhole geometries are supported by a shell of exotic matter located at the wormhole throat @xcite .",
    "the throat connects two ( equal or different ) geometries which can be those of other astrophysical objects .",
    "for example , schwarzschild thin - shell wormholes connect two exterior ( that is , beyond the horizon ) non charged black hole space - times ; hence the geometry at each side of the throat is locally identical to the exterior of a black hole geometry .",
    "however , the topology of the wormhole geometry is non trivial , thus the global properties are essentially different in each case .",
    "our proposal is that global aspects , such as the existence of a throat or not , can be revealed by electrodynamics , more precisely , by the electrostatic self - force on a point charge . in our recent article @xcite we developed this proposal and applied it to the case of wormholes with a cylindrical throat which are mathematically constructed by removing the regions @xmath5 of two gauge cosmic string manifolds and pasting the two regions @xmath6 .",
    "we obtained the self - force on a charge in the cylindrical wormhole geometry , and compared it with the self - force on a charge in the vicinity of a gauge cosmic string .",
    "we showed that the force in the wormhole case can be attractive or repulsive depending of the position of the charge ; this result would then allow an observer to distinguish between two geometries which are locally equal .",
    "it is interesting to remark that there exist some works related to these ideas .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , the authors considered a minimally coupled scalar charge and a electromagnetic charge when a schwarzschild black hole interior is replaced by a material body and found that the leading term in a large-@xmath2 expansion of the force was independent of the central body type . nevertheless , when the scalar charge is not minimally coupled , the self - force is dependent on the composition of the body .",
    "another work in the same line is @xcite , where a spherical ball of perfect fluid in hydrostatic equilibrium with rest mass density and pressure related by some polytropic equations of state is considered .",
    "the authors found that the leading term of the force is universal and does not distinguish the internal body structure , but the next - to - leading order term is sensible to the equation of state .",
    "thus the self - force distinguishes the body composition . in the present work",
    "we extend our study by applying our proposal to the physically interesting case of a schwarzschild thin - shell wormhole : we consider a static point charge in the topologically non trivial space - time constituted by two schwarzschild geometries connected by a wormhole throat ( with the throat radius larger than the schwarzschild horizon radius ) , and we compare the result with the self - force on a charge in the vicinity of a non charged black hole . while some aspects of the analysis will be very similar to those in @xcite",
    ", we will see that the different asymptotic behaviors presented by the cosmic string and black hole geometries will be reflected in some interesting differences in the results .",
    "in the following the electrostatic potential of a static charge in front of a schwarzschild black hole will be considered as a series expansion .",
    "the same expansion will be used to calculate the potential of the charge in presence of a schwarzschild thin - shell wormhole .",

    "a spherically symmetric thin - shell wormhole connecting two identical exterior schwarzschild geometries is locally indistinguishable from a schwarzschild black hole geometry .",
    "however , because the wormhole space - time presents a throat , there is an essential topological difference between both space - times which makes them globally very different . following the proposal of our preceding work @xcite , i.e. that the electrostatic self - force on a point charge could be used to probe the global aspects of a geometry",
    ", we have evaluated this force in both the black hole and the wormhole backgrounds .",
    "it was already known that the force on a charge in the vicinity of a schwarzschild black hole pushes it away , for any position of the charge . in the case of a charge near the wormhole throat",
    "we have obtained an analytical expression of the self - force in the form of a series , which we have evaluated numerically .",
    "the results show that for a certain range of the parameters of the system the self - force is always attractive , that is , it points towards the wormhole throat for any position of the charge , while for another range of the parameters it can be attractive or repulsive depending on the position of the charge .",
    "the repulsive force only appears for a throat radius below @xmath90 , and for a charge placed very near from the wormhole throat .",
    "as the charge is placed far away , for any throat radius , the self - force is always attractive .",
    "this can be observed directly from the asymptotic expansion ( [ asy ] ) .",
    "thus the electrostatics of a point charge would allow to decide whether the background geometry presents a throat or not .",
    "a detail to be noted is that now , in the case of a charge in a spherical wormhole geometry , the self - force on a charge placed far from the throat is always attractive , while in the case studied in @xcite the self - force on a charge very far from the throat of a cylindrical wormhole with a deficit angle , was always repulsive .",
    "this can be understood as a consequence of the different asymptotic behaviors of the schwarzschild and cosmic string geometries . while the schwarzschild space - time is asymptotically flat ( as @xmath28 the metric becomes minkowski ) , the angle deficit associated to a gauge cosmic string is constant .",
    "then , very far from the throat of a cylindrical wormhole , the dominant effect on the electric field lines is that of the deficit angle which induces a repulsive force . in the spherically symmetric wormhole connecting two schwarzschild geometries ,",
    "instead , this effect is not present as the metric tends to that of a flat background . near the throat , for the cylindrical wormhole associated to a cosmic string",
    ", the attractive effect of the throat reverses the repulsive deficit angle effect deriving in a force towards the hole . for the thin - shell schwarzschild wormhole ,",
    "the intense repulsive effect in the exterior neighboring geometry of a black hole horizon may reverse the attractive contribution of the wormhole .",
    "in this appendix it will be shown that the expansion ( [ vcw ] ) is equivalent to the electrostatic potential ( [ willy ] ) for a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the arguments are analogous to those in @xcite , the main difference is that the electrostatic potential of that reference does nt fit the correct boundary conditions at infinity . for this purpose it may be convenient to introduce the so called isotropic radial coordinate @xmath110 given in terms of the schwarzschild one @xmath2 by the following formula = , r>2 m .",
    "note that this coordinate do not cover completely the black hole space - time , only the outer region of the horizon at @xmath15 .",
    "the previous expression may be inverted to give r=(1+)^2,2>m .",
    "the schwarzschild distance element in isotropic coordinates takes the following form g_4=-dt^2+(1+)^4(d^2+^2d^2+^2 ^ 2d^2 ) .",
    "the electrostatic potential for a point charge in the black hole , ( [ willy ] ) , is expressed in isotropic coordinates as @xmath111 ^ 2\\rho[1+(m/2\\rho)]^2}\\bigg[\\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho^2+b_1 ^ 2 - 2b_1\\rho \\cos\\theta}{\\rho^2+b^2 - 2b\\rho \\cos\\theta}}+\\frac{m^2}{4b^2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho^2+b^2 - 2b\\rho \\cos\\theta}{\\rho^2+b_1 ^ 2 - 2b_1\\rho \\cos\\theta}}\\bigg]\\ ] ] + , with @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "the task is to show that the expansion of this potential in the independent functions ( [ fyg ] ) is exactly ( [ vcw ] ) . by further defining the dimensionless",
    "coordinate @xmath114 and the dimensionless position of the charge as @xmath115 the potential reads as follows v^bh=+ . at @xmath18 and @xmath116 this expression reduces to v^bh = v^bh_1+v^bh_2=+ . the first term of ( [ poto ] ) can be worked out in terms of the geometric series as follows @xmath117\\ ] ] = ( 1+++ .. )@xmath118.\\ ] ] now , in order to connect this with the legendre functions @xmath119 and @xmath120 the three following identities will be useful = -n_m=0^q_2m+n-1(x ) , @xmath121 , @xmath122 .",
    "in addition , by taking the derivative with respect to @xmath123 of ( [ ww1 ] ) , it follows that = -n_m=0^q_2m+n-1(x ) .",
    "these identities can be implemented in ( [ poto2 ] ) by evaluating x= , in ( [ ww4 ] ) . by comparing with ( [ poto2 ] )",
    "it follows that @xmath124 @xmath125 @xmath126 = \\frac{e\\beta}{m(\\beta+1)^2}\\frac{(\\eta-1)^2}{2\\eta}\\bigg[\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\sum_{t=0}^{n}\\frac{(4n+3)}{4\\pi}\\bigg(\\beta^{2(n - t)+1}+\\frac{1}{\\beta^{2(n - t)+1}}\\bigg)\\ ] ] @xmath127 q_2n()-(+)q_0 ( ) ] .",
    "the last expression can be worked out further by use of ( [ ww2])-([ww3 ] ) to give @xmath128 p_n()q_n ( ) ] . by",
    "expressing ( [ lost ] ) in terms the schwarzschild coordinates @xmath2 and @xmath66 it follows that @xmath129 ( a-2m)p_n(-1)(r-2m)q_n(-1 ) ] .",
    "as we pointed earlier , the legendre functions which appear in this section are been differentiated in its argument and then evaluated in the specified value , so that the elementary identity q_0(-1)=_(-1)=- , together with the definitions ( [ fyg ] ) , shows that : v^bh_1=-+q_l=0^ g_l(a)f_l(r ) . on the other hand the expression of the potential @xmath130 in ( [ poto2 ] ) in schwarzschild coordinates is v^bh_2= , and therefore v^bh = v^bh_1+v^bh_2=q_l=0^ g_l(a)f_l(r ) .",
    "this is the electrostatic potential evaluated at the surface @xmath18 . since we know that for @xmath131 the expression should be an expansion of the form v(r,)=q_l=0^ f_l(r)p_l ( ) , with @xmath132 radial functions labelled by @xmath133 and which are solutions of ( [ lapli ] ) .",
    "this expression should reduce to ( [ redu ] ) when @xmath18 , or equivalently for @xmath134 . from this",
    "it follows that the full expression for the potential should be v^bh = v^bh_1+v^bh_2=q_l=0^ g_l(a)f_l(r)p_l ( ) , which is the formula ( [ vcw ] ) described in the text for @xmath116 .",
    "the corresponding expression for @xmath5 is completely analogous and we just omit it .",
    "therefore we have seen that the expansion ( [ vcw ] ) is the same as the potential ( [ willy ] ) , which is what we wanted to show . + * acknowledgements : * the authors are supported by conicet ( argentina ) ."
