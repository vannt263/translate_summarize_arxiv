    "while the standard model is highly successful as an effective field theory in describing nature , one of its big mysteries is the observed pattern of quark and lepton masses and mixing angles .",
    "this puzzle remains even after new physics such as supersymmetry or strong dynamics is introduced in order to solve the hierarchy problem .",
    "in fact , there is quite often a tension between solutions to the hierarchy problem and a successful picture of flavor physics , leading to many models that , while quite interesting , perhaps seem more contrived than what nature should allow .    a simple explanation of the structure of flavor physics can come about if the yukawa interactions are anarchical in the uv but each field comes with an additional suppression factor in the ir effective theory  @xcite .",
    "these suppression factors can arise in 4d theories if each field carries a different anomalous dimension under strong conformal dynamics  @xcite , or in warped 5d theories  @xcite if each field has a different exponential profile as determined by its bulk mass  @xcite .",
    "in fact , these two pictures can be related via the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite .",
    "the bulk masses in 5d theories are usually taken to be free parameters , leading to a successful explanation of flavor physics , but leaving open the question of whether there exists a dual 4d cft containing operators with the corresponding anomalous dimensions .",
    "on the other hand , one can attempt to find concrete 4d theories in which the anomalous dimensions can be determined as output , rather than input .",
    "some examples of this in a supersymmetric context were given in  @xcite .",
    "however , these models were necessarily somewhat complicated because , unless there were a large number of marginal interactions in the superpotential , there was no general method available to determine the anomalous dimensions ( or equivalently the @xmath0-charges ) of every field .",
    "here we point out that @xmath1-maximization  @xcite is precisely the needed method , because it allows one to determine the correct superconformal @xmath2-symmetry even when there are only a small number of additional constraints .",
    "we will demonstrate that this allows one to construct very simple calculable models of flavor physics , as well as reanalyze the ` incalculable ' models presented in @xcite .",
    "however , since these models inevitably introduce many new multiplets charged under @xmath3 , this flavor physics must occur at a high scale in order for the visible gauge couplings to remain perturbative .",
    "in addition , many of these models introduce couplings that violate baryon and lepton number , potentially inducing problematic proton - decay operators . a simple way to avoid both of these constraints is to assume that the conformal dynamics occurs above the gut scale , and thus we focus on on finding the simplest vector - like flavor models in the context of @xmath4 unification .",
    "we will find that , even in this case , a significant constraint comes from requiring that the @xmath4 gauge coupling remain perturbative throughout the entire conformal window .",
    "however , we will demonstrate that a small class of models can also satisfy this constraint while explaining the observed flavor hierarchies .",
    "the outline of this work is as follows . in section  [ sec : overview ]",
    "we will give brief reviews of flavor physics and @xmath1-maximization .",
    "in section  [ sec : sunmodels ] we study simple concrete flavor models with vector - like matter content . in section  [ sec : incalculable ] we analyze one of the previously ` incalculable ' models presented by nelson and strassler .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "we will start with a brief review of how the flavor hierarchies appear in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model .",
    "the yukawa couplings of the matter fields @xmath5 to the higgs fields @xmath6 arise from the superpotential operators w = y_u^i j q_i u_j h_u + y_d^i j q_i d_j h_d + y_l^i j l_i e_j h_d ( + y_n^i j l_i n_j h_u + m^i j_n n_i n_j ) , where the matrices @xmath7 possess a hierarchical structure in the basis where all of the matter fields have a canonically normalized khler potential .",
    "( here we have included the possibility of generating neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism by integrating out massive right - handed neutrinos @xmath8 . )",
    "there are two fundamentally different ways that this hierarchical structure could arise from an underlying flavor physics model .",
    "the first is that the model genuinely generates a hierarchical structure in the superpotential while not significantly affecting the khler potential .",
    "this could happen , e.g. , in models in which the couplings of the lighter generations ultimately arise from higher dimensional operators in the superpotential  @xcite . in this case",
    "one would need to know the details of the model in order to determine if there are any predicted relations between the masses and mixing angles .",
    "the second possibility is that the superpotential contains no hierarchical structure ( `` flavor anarchy '' ) , but the underlying flavor physics model generates a hierarchy in the wave - function factors = d^4 _ i z_i ^_i ^_i , with , e.g. , @xmath9 .",
    "taking @xmath10 , then up to @xmath11 coefficients one obtains the generic mass structure ( m_t ,  m_c ,  m_u ) & & h_u ( _ q_3 _ u_3 _ h_u ,  _ q_2 _ u_2 _",

    ", we ll focus primarily on supersymmetric @xmath13 gut models , with three sm generations @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and higgs fields @xmath16 . when @xmath17 relations are satisfied at the unification scale @xmath18 , one has the relations _",
    "u_i = _ e_i _ t_i _ d_i = _ l_i _ |f_i .",
    "considering the gut values of the up - type quark masses then yields the estimates ( extracted from ref .",
    "@xcite at @xmath19 ) _",
    "t_i ( .001.002 , .03.04 , .7.8 ) .",
    "note however that a somewhat larger value of @xmath20 ( by a factor of @xmath21 ) is preferred by the cabibbo angle in eq.([eq : ckm ] ) .",
    "similarly , considering the gut values of the down - type quark masses yields the estimates [ eps5quarks ] _ |f_i _",
    "|h ( .002.01 , .001.007 , .006.02 ) , while considering the lepton masses gives [ eps5leptons ] _ |f_i _ |h ( .001.002 , .006.01 , .01.03 ) . here we have tried to illustrate the potentially large uncertainties arising from susy threshold corrections , which can be important at larger values of @xmath22 . in most cases , an @xmath11 violation of the gut relations in the first and second generations will be required to be consistent with low - energy data .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting that the estimates of eqs.([eps5quarks ] ) and ( [ eps5leptons ] ) are not hierarchically different from one another . in particular , it is still entirely possible that the suppression factors arising from the khler potential respect @xmath4 relations but the anarchical superpotential couplings do not .",
    "moreover , it may still be possible that @xmath4 relations are allowed in the presence of large susy threshold corrections  @xcite . in the present work",
    ", we will not present a completely realistic gut model or discuss the origin of susy - breaking parameters , and so will for the most part attempt to remain agnostic about how @xmath11 violations of these relations may arise .",
    "perhaps the minimal potentially realistic structure consistent with these estimates is a ` * 10 * -centered ' model , or a model which generates suppressions in @xmath20 and @xmath23 . in the simplest version , the smallness of the down - type masses must be generated through a combination of large @xmath22 and somewhat small @xmath11 factors .",
    "smaller @xmath22 is possible , however , if the model additionally generates suppressed values of @xmath24 or @xmath25 . in this case",
    ", a somewhat small value of @xmath26 relative to @xmath27 may also be preferred to explain the smallness of @xmath28 .",
    "however , since this may not be necessary to explain the ratio of @xmath29 , this will depend on the details of how gut - breaking effects are introduced .    while somewhat tangential to the present work , it is interesting to note that the above approach to flavor physics can have important implications for the susy flavor problem .",
    "if the flavor hierarchies simply arise as small numbers in the superpotential ( as is commonly assumed ) , one might worry that generic @xmath30-suppressed susy - breaking operators in the khler potential such as @xmath31 will lead to large flavor violation in the soft masses if they are the dominant contribution . in this case one",
    "is strongly motivated to think about alternative mediation mechanisms such as gauge mediation  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the flavor hierarchies arise from the wave - function factors @xmath32 , then supersymmetry - breaking operators will also be suppressed by factors of @xmath33 upon canonically normalizing the fields , potentially leading to a simple solution of the flavor problem  @xcite .",
    "note that in the present scenario these operators can also be further suppressed ( or enhanced ) because in superconformal theories the anomalous dimension of @xmath34 need not be simply related to the anomalous dimension of @xmath35 .",
    "the models we will consider in this paper are based on an elegant solution for producing hierarchical suppression factors using strong dynamics , which was first proposed in a supersymmetric context by nelson and strassler in  @xcite .",
    "they considered extending the mssm to include a strongly coupled sector with gauge group @xmath36 .",
    "standard model fields @xmath35 are singlets under @xmath36 , but can develop large anomalous dimensions @xmath37 via superpotential couplings to operators in the new sector .",
    "these anomalous dimensions exponentiate into large wave - function factors in the ir , leading to suppression factors [ eq : wavefunctionrunning ] = -_i _ _ i= ( -1 2__c^ _ i d ) , where @xmath38 is the uv scale at which the yukawas are anarchical , and @xmath39 is the scale at which the exotic sector decouples .",
    "the anomalous dimensions @xmath37 are typically @xmath11 .",
    "so to satisfactorily reproduce the sm yukawa hierarchies we need the strong dynamics to persist over a large range of scales @xmath40 .",
    "following @xcite , we consider the case where the strong sector gauge and superpotential couplings flow from the uv to an approximate conformal fixed point at @xmath41 and exit the approximately conformal regime at @xmath42 , for instance due to @xmath39-scale masses for the exotic matter charged under @xmath36 .    in the range",
    "@xmath43 $ ] , we can compute the anomalous dimensions @xmath37 at leading order by ignoring the sm gauge and yukawa couplings and approximating our theory as a supersymmetric conformal field theory ( scft ) with strongly - coupled gauge group @xmath36 and an @xmath13 global flavor symmetry . in this approximation ,",
    "the @xmath37 are constant , and eq.([eq : wavefunctionrunning ] ) can be integrated trivially to give [ eq : suppressionfactors ] _ _ i = ( ) ^1 2_i    conformal or near - conformal dynamics is often easiest to understand in a ` physical ' basis where we keep the fields canonically normalized @xmath44 at each scale @xmath45 , rather than a ` holomorphic ' basis where the superpotential is not renormalized . ) . at a conformal fixed point ,",
    "both of these effects are nonzero , but the rescaling anomaly  @xcite from passing to the physical basis exactly cancels the one - loop gauge - coupling running .",
    "it s simpler to stay in the physical basis where neither the kinetic terms nor the gauge couplings run at a conformal fixed point . ]",
    "we will use the physical basis for the rest of this paper , so let us take a moment to recover eq.([eq : suppressionfactors ] ) using it . in the physical basis , superpotential couplings run according to the anomalous dimensions of the associated operators , while kinetic terms in the khler potential are rg invariant .",
    "for instance , the standard model yukawa couplings @xmath46 and @xmath47 run according to [ eq : yukawarunning ] & = & _ y^ij_u = 1 2(_t_i + _ t_j + _ h ) y^ij_u , + & = & _ y^ij_d = 1 2 ( _ t_i + _",
    "|f_i + _ |h ) y^ij_d . in the cft approximation where @xmath37 are constant ,",
    "these integrate to y^ij_u(_c ) & = & ( ) ^1 2(_t_i + _",
    "t_j + _ h ) y^ij_u( ) , + y^ij_d(_c ) & = & ( ) ^1 2(_t_i + _ _ j + _ ) y^ij_d( ) , which of course agrees with the suppression factors eq.([eq : suppressionfactors ] ) .",
    "a particularly attractive feature of superconformal flavor models is that different sm generations can be singled out dynamically by the cft . indeed ,",
    "even with flavor anarchy in the uv , the basic representation theory of the exotic sector can naturally lead to a hierarchy . as an example , let us consider a toy strong sector with @xmath48 and matter content given in table  [ tab : onegeneration ] .",

    "<S> , we construct the simplest vector - like flavor models and discuss their viability . </S>",
    "<S> a significant constraint on these models comes from requiring that the visible gauge couplings remain perturbative throughout the conformal window needed to generate the hierarchies . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find that there is a small class of simple flavor models that can evade this bound .    </S>",
