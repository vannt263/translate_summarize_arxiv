    "the structural and dynamical properties of confined fluids can be very different from that of bulk fluids .",
    "upon dimensional restriction first order phase transitions transform into continuous ones  @xcite , jamming and glass formation occur  @xcite and significant changes in some transport properties arise  @xcite .",
    "in addition , other phenomena such as wetting , surface ordering , and layering transitions may occur in the presence of confinement  @xcite .",
    "a fundamental issue in confined systems is to understand how the dimensional reduction of spatial variables changes the nature of phase transitions .",
    "it is a well - known result of the van hove s theorem  @xcite that particles interacting with short range potentials do not exhibit a genuine phase transition in one dimension .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to study how the first order phase transitions become continuous in slit - like pores and cylindrical tubes . along this line",
    "several molecular fluids and colloidal systems have been examined by changing the pore - width in slit - like geometries  @xcite and the pore - diameter in nanotubes  @xcite .",
    "common results of these studies are that the first order phase transitions observed in bulk may become continuous if one of the dimensions of the pore is reduced to the order of the size of the particle .",
    "this happens with the solid - liquid transition of water in nanotubes  @xcite and with the isotropic - nematic transition of rod - like colloids in slit - like pores  @xcite .",
    "confinement may yield new types of phases such as the hexatic  @xcite and the biaxial - nematic ones  @xcite .",
    "moreover , unusual phase transitions can occur such as liquid - liquid  @xcite and smectic - smectic  @xcite .",
    "the criticality of confined water has been also studied in slit - like pores , where the liquid - liquid phase transition of water monolayers terminates at a critical temperature . the observed criticality belongs to the universality class of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) ising - model  @xcite .    along this line , the motivation of our work is to study the structural and critical behavior of a 2d system of confined hard squares , where the squares are allowed to rotate and move freely in a narrow channel of width @xmath3 . in our previous work",
    "@xcite , we obtained that a fluid phase with parallel alignment to the wall abruptly transforms into a solid - like zigzag structure upon increasing pressure .",
    "we have found that our system shows extremely similar features than others presenting first order phase transitions .",
    "these results were based on numerical solutions of transfer operator equations and simulations , being both in very good accordance with each other .",
    "it is important to note that with our previous methods the sharpness of the structural transition was impossible to study for @xmath6 , @xmath7 being the pore width where the close packing densities of the parallel fluid and the zigzag structures are the same .    in this paper",
    "we further study the above described system in a pure analytical way by discretizing the rotational and transversal positions .",
    "we are employing dimensionless lengths ; they are understood in @xmath0 units where @xmath0 is the side length of the square , e.g. the positional coordinates of the centers of squares are @xmath8 , @xmath9 etc .",
    "we set @xmath10 to satisfy the first neighbor interaction condition .",
    "this means that we have a quasi - one - dimensional system of classical particles which can be handled by the transfer operator method .",
    "it is well known that the _ equilibrium _ statistical physics of our system can be given by solving the following eigenvalue equation @xmath11 the kernel @xmath12 of the above integral operator is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the @xmath15 projection of the contact distance of the nearest neighbor particles with orientations @xmath16 , @xmath17 and positions @xmath18 , @xmath19 ; furthermore @xmath20 is the inverse temperature and @xmath4 is the dimensionless longitudinal pressure ( or force ) , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the real longitudinal two - dimensional pressure in energy per square length units .",
    "note that this operator is clearly compact since it fulfills @xmath23 , i.e. the kernel type is hilbert  schmidt .",
    "moreover , @xmath12 ( eq .  ) is everywhere positive and therefore the operator is irreducible . finally , the integral operator is a positive operator in the sense that the image of all non - negative functions is non negative . for this case ,",
    "based on the perron ",
    "jentzsch theorem  @xcite , it can be proved that the dominant eigenvalue ( @xmath24 ) of the operator is unique , there is a gap between @xmath24 and the remaining part of the spectrum , and @xmath24 is an analytic function of @xmath4 ( and @xmath3 )  @xcite .",
    "thus , phase transitions ( both , first order and continuous ) , as traditionally defined in the framework of statistical physics , are definitely out of the question .",
    "the aim of the present paper is twofold . on the one hand we want to shed some light on the reason why the numerical and simulation ( or even experimental ) studies seem to predict a discontinuous behavior in spite of the above cited analytic theory . on the other hand",
    ", there still exists the demand to know whether the system shows real divergences at least at infinite pressure . to this end",
    ", we need to define an analytically solvable model , i.e. a simpler one , so that the limiting cases can be studied in an exact manner .",
    "therefore , here we study a model in which both the orientation and the @xmath18 position of the particles are restricted to discretized values and only the @xmath15 position is continuous . to capture the main features of the freely rotating case",
    ", we have found that the minimal model must have at least four states for all particles , see fig .",
    "[ fig : tube ] .",
    "fortunately , this model shows qualitatively similar structures to the continuum model . even though the discretization of the orientational and positional degrees of freedom rises some fundamental questions  @xcite ,",
    "we believe that the main features of the continuous system are captured .",
    "we will go back to this point at the end of the paper .    in the next section we present our notation and the analytic solution of the discretized model based on the transfer operator method . in the third section",
    "we examine the behavior of the orientational order parameter , correlation lengths and response functions , such as the isobaric heat capacity and the isothermal compressibility .",
    "based on these results , we show that the system has a 1d ising - like critical point at infinite pressure and a special channel width @xmath25 . in the light of this result",
    "we revisit the problem of the structural transition between parallel fluid and a zigzag solid - like structures and we conclude that in the vicinity of the critical point this transition is practically indistinguishable from a genuine first order phase transition .",
    "unfortunately , this @xmath6 study is numerically impossible for the freely rotating case  @xcite .",
    "finally , in the last section we summarize our results and discuss the possible relation with glassy and jammed behavior , mentioned frequently in the literature in connection with other quasi - one - dimensional hard particle models .",
    "in our model the orientation of a particle can have two different values : @xmath26 the side of the square is parallel to the wall , this orientational state of a particle is denoted by @xmath27 or @xmath28 the diagonal of the square is parallel to the wall , which is denoted as @xmath29 . ( the index @xmath30 refers to the `` orientation '' and the `` ket '' and  bra  symbols",
    "follow the notation given in ref .  @xcite . )",
    "furthermore , we assume that the particles are always in contact with one wall , see fig .",
    "[ fig : tube ] .",
    "thus , if the channel width is @xmath3 then the @xmath18 coordinate of a particle in the orientational state @xmath27 can be @xmath31 , and the @xmath18 coordinate of a particle in the orientational state @xmath29 can be @xmath32 .",
    "these @xmath18 positional states  regardless of the difference due to the orientation  are denoted by @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    ) , as labeled .",
    "the particles with @xmath27 and @xmath29 orientation can move only on the blue and green dashed lines , respectively . when a particle changes its orientation , at the same time it changes its @xmath18 position , too .",
    "[ fig : tube ] ]    these four possible combination of orientations and @xmath18 positions form a basis in the four dimensional @xmath35 space .",
    "these basis states can be written as @xmath36 and the transfer operator acts on the space spanned by the above orthonormal basis .",
    "the matrix of the transfer operator ( the transfer matrix ) in this basis can be written as .",
    "the upper bound is necessary , but the calculations can be extended without any problem in the @xmath37 domain when the only difference is that @xmath38 which has no any interesting consequence .",
    "we will see that the @xmath39 case is unimportant . ]",
    "@xmath40    certainly , the operator represented by this matrix is positive , irreducible and compact , therefore the theorem presented in  @xcite is valid for this case , i.e. a phase transition is impossible .",
    "the model under study has a simple property , namely that there is no `` entanglement '' between the orientational and the @xmath18 degrees of freedom in the sense which is clarified below .",
    "therefore , matrix ( [ eq : k ] ) can be diagonalized in an easy way . for this purpose",
    "we define a unitary operator @xmath41 , where @xmath42 acts only on the @xmath18 degrees of freedom .",
    "its matrix in the @xmath33 , @xmath34 basis is @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the unit operator acting only on the orientational degrees of freedom . the unitary operator @xmath41 uncouples the @xmath45 and @xmath46 degrees of freedom .",
    "this means that @xmath12 has two pieces of two dimensional invariant subspaces : @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( where @xmath49 denotes the one dimensional subspace in @xmath50 generated by the vector @xmath51 ) .",
    "in other words , the matrix of @xmath12 after the @xmath41 transformation is a block diagonal matrix , which has the following @xmath52 blocks in its diagonal : @xmath53 the above @xmath54 and @xmath55 symmetric matrices can be diagonalized by unitary operators @xmath56 and @xmath57 , which act only on the orientational degrees of freedom and their matrices ( in the @xmath58 basis ) can be written as @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61    now we can summarize our results detailed above .",
    "@xmath12 can be diagonalized by the unitary operator @xmath62 that is , the eigenvectors of @xmath12 are @xmath63 and the corresponding eigenvalues are @xmath64 . in detail , the eigenvectors are    @xmath65    [ eq : psi ]    and taking into account that @xmath66 , the corresponding eigenvalues are    @xmath67    [ eq : lambda ]    it can be seen that for any value of @xmath4 and @xmath3 we have @xmath68 , however @xmath69 .",
    "as mentioned above , the orientational and @xmath18 positional degrees of freedom are not `` entangled '' .",
    "we mean that all the eigenvectors have a form @xmath70 .",
    "that is the reason why we need to solve only two quadratic equations instead of a quartic one .",
    "this simple feature of the transfer operator does not hold for the freely rotating case . from the general transfer operator theory",
    "follows ( see e.g.  @xcite ) that the gibbs free energy is given by @xmath71    having a one - particle physical quantity @xmath72 , i.e. for a given microscopic state of the system @xmath72 has four ( in general ) different values , @xmath73 , depending on the state only of the @xmath74-th particle which is labeled by @xmath75 , we can define an operator of which matrix is diagonal in the basis given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : basis ] ) : @xmath76 . now",
    "the expectation value of @xmath72 ( which is , in our case , certainly independent of the label of the particle , @xmath74 , because we have no positionally dependent external fields ) can be written as @xmath77 and the correlation function between @xmath74-th neighboring particles is given by @xmath78    the orientation and position of a particle give examples for one - particle properties .",
    "if we define @xmath16 as the orientation of a particle in state @xmath79 such as @xmath80 and in state @xmath81 such as @xmath82 , then the operator @xmath83 , related to the one particle quantity @xmath84 , can be represented by the matrix @xmath85 using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : psi_0 ] ) , and we find that the orientational order parameter , @xmath86 , which is the expectation value of @xmath87 , can be expressed as @xmath88 and the correlation function as @xmath89 because from eq .",
    "( [ eq : s_o ] ) it can be seen that @xmath90 . in a similar way we can define the operator of the @xmath18 position , denoted also by @xmath18 , which can be represented by the matrix @xmath91 from the above definition we get @xmath92 and @xmath93",
    "note that the second term alternates sign with @xmath74 since @xmath94 is the only negative eigenvalue .",
    "figure  [ fig : eta  p ] shows the pressure , @xmath4 , as a function of the packing fraction , @xmath95 . here",
    "@xmath96 is the length of the channel ( normalized by @xmath0 ) along the @xmath15 axis .",
    "the equation of state can be calculated from the result ( [ eq : lambda_0 ] ) using eq .",
    "( [ eq : g ] ) , yielding @xmath97    1.9 , 1.85 , 1.84 , 1.835 , and 1.83 , respectively .",
    "the inset zooms in the black curve plateau and highlights its sharpness , since @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) , while @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "[ fig : eta  p ] ]    although @xmath102 is obtained from an analytic formula , it shows a plateau which increases its resemblance with a first order discontinuity as @xmath103 .",
    "note that for the case of @xmath104 ( see the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : eta  p ] ) , it already turns almost impossible to plot the curve as a smooth function , and this feature worsens for @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , although continuous , the system behavior can not be practically distinguished from a genuine first order transition neither by simulations nor  in case this system could have an experimental realization  by real experiments .",
    "the situation is similar to the case of a finite but large ( @xmath105 ) system .",
    "we know from the statistical physics that in a finite system all derivatives of the free energy are continuous .",
    "the singularities , in the mathematical sense , appear only when considering the thermodynamic limit . however , although real systems consist of a finite but very large number of particles , experiments clearly show all significant features of phase transitions .",
    "it is generally accepted that the freezing of one liter of water is a genuine phase transition even if the system is finite and so there is no mathematical singularity .    before we discuss the reason for our system behavior we show how other thermodynamic properties also depict quasi - singularities .",
    "the isothermal ( and longitudinal ) compressibility , given by @xmath106 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : compressibility  p ] .    ]    as can be seen , @xmath107 peaks at the structural transition , while turning extremely sharp as @xmath6 .",
    "now we examine the order parameters and their correlation functions .",
    "the orientational order parameter ( see eq .",
    "[ eq:<s_o > ] ) can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:<s_o>p ] . at",
    "very low pressure the system behaves as an ideal gas and both @xmath108 and @xmath109 orientations turn equally probable .",
    "this is simply because we are considering the same number of @xmath18-positions for both @xmath108 and @xmath109 orientations .",
    "thus , this behavior differs from that of the freely @xmath18-positioning system , since in this last case parallel configurations are favored by entropy , i.e. there are more configurations for the @xmath108-orientation than for the @xmath109-orientation for an isolated particle . with increasing pressure the orientation @xmath108",
    "is preferred because the @xmath108-@xmath109 pair at contact has a large @xmath15-projection and the @xmath109-@xmath109 pair is favored only for large @xmath109 clusters @xcite .",
    "then , at a given @xmath110 pressure a structural change happens in the system and the orientation @xmath109 becomes more favored .",
    "clearly , the @xmath108 can not hold as the packing fraction surpasses @xmath111 , but the structural transition takes place slightly below this value .",
    "the orientational correlation function , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : g_o ] ) , can be written as @xmath112 with @xmath113 and @xmath114    note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : g_o - exp ] ) is not only asymptotically but exactly valid for any neighboring distance @xmath74 .",
    "the amplitude of the orientational correlations , @xmath115 , is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : a_o  p ] and the orientational correlation length , @xmath116 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xi_o  p ] .    te orientational correlation length increases",
    "monotonically with increasing pressure at small densities , but the amplitude of the correlation function decreases and the correlations almost vanish even for @xmath117 if @xmath118 .",
    "then , the amplitude has a sharp peak when the correlation length is maximal , indicating the strong and large scale fluctuations in the system at this special point .",
    "finally , both the amplitude and the correlation length go down as @xmath4 approaches infinity .",
    "all the above described peculiar behavior happens at a @xmath119 pressure which can be determined from the @xmath120 condition .",
    "when this equality is fulfilled at high pressure , the off - diagonal elements of @xmath54 can be neglected ( because @xmath121 at high @xmath4 ) . if we suppose , as an approximation , that @xmath122 , then the two different eigenvalues of @xmath54 , namely @xmath24 and @xmath123 , cross each other as @xmath4 is increased , and the system yields a first order transition at @xmath124 from a @xmath108 to a @xmath109 oriented structure . under this approximation , the perron ",
    "frobenius arguments can not longer be applied , because the transfer matrix has zero entries .",
    "thus , the phase transition appears only by forcing the off - diagonal terms in @xmath54 to zero . by removing this imposition ,",
    "the level crossing of the two eigenvalues is avoided , i. e. the two eigenvalues only approach each other and the system does not yield a first order transition .",
    "however , the closer the eigenvalues approach each other , the more the behavior of the system gets reminiscent to that of a phase transition .",
    "the strength of this reminiscence increases with decreasing @xmath3 while @xmath125 .",
    "this happens due to the fact that when @xmath3 approaches @xmath7 , @xmath110 increases and the level crossing approximation ( the negligence of @xmath126 ) becomes more valid .",
    "the @xmath127 equation can be written , in more detail , as @xmath128 in case of large pressure ( @xmath129 ) equation ( [ eq : level_crossing ] ) simplify as @xmath130 as we have mentioned , for a given @xmath3 the solution of eq .",
    "[ eq : level_crossing ] determines the @xmath110 value of the pressure , where the system behaves similarly as presenting a first order transition .",
    "hereafter we call @xmath110 as the level crossing pressure . alternatively , if we keep the pressure fixed and deal with @xmath3 as a control parameter , from eq .",

    "it is easy to show that @xmath134 and @xmath135 , which explain why the level crossing approximation becomes more valid as @xmath3 approaches @xmath7 .",
    "it is important to note that both the orientational correlation length and the compressibility truly diverge as @xmath136 in such a special way that the condition @xmath127 is always fulfilled .",
    "when we go on this level crossing line , for large @xmath4 ( from which follows that @xmath137 ) , the orientational correlation length goes with @xmath4 as @xmath138^{-1 }      \\approx \\frac{\\tilde \\lambda}{2 \\tilde v }     \\approx   \\frac{1}{2 } e^{p(3/2-\\sqrt{2 } ) } ,    \\label{eq : xi_near_critical_point}\\ ] ] from where we observe that the orientational correlation length diverges exponentially .",
    "further in the text we argue that this is really a critical divergence .      when we see more carefully the correlation function given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : g_o - exp ] ) , we can observe that on the level crossing line the amplitude of the correlation function equals one ( @xmath139 ) .",

    "therefore , @xmath179 . in other words , there is not a spontaneous formation of an ordered phase in our model ( which is not surprising in quasi-1d ) .",
    "consequently , the value of @xmath180 , the critical exponent related to the order parameter , can not be computed directly .",

    "( [ eq : scaling_of_g_in_our_model ] ) we have seen that the dimension is @xmath161 , and from the scaling law @xmath185 we consistently obtain @xmath184 .",
    "the effect of @xmath184 is observed in fig .",
    "[ fig:<s_o>p ] , that is , as @xmath186 on the level crossing line , both @xmath187 and @xmath188 go to the step function .",
    "this is a very important difference compared with the usual critical points in three dimensions .",
    "from the obtained critical exponents we can see that _",
    "the @xmath144 critical point belongs to the universality class of the 1d ising model .",
    "the important consequence of this result , as we discussed in the previous paragraph , is that the critical exponent @xmath184 ( contrasting with the usual @xmath189 value of 3d systems ) , implies that the order parameter is discontinuous at the @xmath144 point .",
    "despite the fact that this discontinuity disappears at any finite pressure , it has a significant impact on the system behavior near the critical point .",
    "namely , the order parameter and the density behave almost like the step function , and their derivatives , as the compressibility , have high peaks .",
    "simulation results , as close as possible to the @xmath144 point and for the unrestricted @xmath18 and @xmath16 system , show that the system behavior is indistinguishable from that of a first order transition  @xcite",
    ".    the discontinuity can disappear at any finite @xmath4 because the thermodynamic quantities are singular at the @xmath144 fixed point , contrary to the case of a zero temperature discontinuity fixed point of the usual 3d systems , like the ferromagnets . in this last case",
    "the thermodynamic quantities are not singular at a discontinuity fixed point which separates the different phases , and perturbation theory should have a finite radius of convergence , therefore the reason of the discontinuity , the coexistence of the different phases must persist for some distance into the phase diagram . this coexistence line is terminated at a different , critical fixed point  @xcite . in 1d , these two fixed points , the critical and the discontinuity ones are merged in a unique fixed point .",
    "this is the origin of the peculiar behavior of our 1d system , which is reminiscent of a first order phase transition though every property can be expressed as an analytic function .",
    "let us now discuss the physical origin of the `` external field '' given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_def ] ) . by extending our model with an external field which favors the @xmath109 orientation against with the @xmath108 one , including in the hamiltonian a @xmath190 term",
    ", this extra field @xmath191 simply appears as an additive term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_def ] ) .",
    "this points out that @xmath155 has exactly the same effect as an extra external field @xmath191 which is directly coupled to particle orientation .",
    "but in our system the special combination of two different external fields  the external pressure @xmath4 and the wall of the channel  results in an effective field which favors one orientation or the other . moreover , the strength and the `` direction '' of this effective field depend on the values of @xmath4 and @xmath3 , given that the longitudinal pressure favors the closely packed @xmath109 orientation ( having vanishing @xmath18-fluctuations ) and the wall the @xmath108 orientation .",
    "in other words , the direction of this external field results from an entropic competition between the @xmath15 and @xmath18 fluctuations .",
    "we would like to emphasize the following interesting feature of the @xmath160 point : the compressibility diverges as @xmath192 .",
    "this is quite special in a system consisting of only rigid particles .",
    "usually @xmath193 implies that the system approaches the close packing structure while the compressibility goes to zero .",
    "but in our system , at @xmath194 the close packing structure is degenerated , because the @xmath108 and the @xmath109 orientations have the same close packing density .",
    "this is the key feature of this point : the system can not decide between these two competitive structures . in this sense , it is very similar to a spontaneous symmetry breaking . note that other systems may show this peculiar point . for instance , hard anisotropic particles get spatially and orientationaly ordered at close packing , whereas spheres ( or disks ) get only spatially ordered . in the limit of small anisotropy , both , the orientationaly ordered and disordered structures also have the same packing fraction , and the structure gets again degenerated  @xcite .      up to this point",
    "we have focused only on the orientational correlations in our model , which can be totally described by the @xmath52 transfer matrix @xmath54 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : blocks_k ] ) .",
    "thus , the analogy with the 1d ising model comes as no surprise because this last model can be described by a @xmath52 transfer matrix , too .",
    "however , in addition to the continuous longitudinal translational degrees of freedom , every particle has 4 discrete possible states , instead of the 2 states of the ising model .",
    "to evaluate the @xmath18 positional correlation function we have to take into account the 2nd and 3rd eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the transfer operator , and so the above mentioned @xmath52 matrix , @xmath54 , is not enough anymore .",
    "the expectation value @xmath195 is zero , as we have mentioned at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : ii ] .",
    "its correlation function , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : g_y ] ) , can be written as @xmath196 and the corresponding results are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : g_y  p ] .",
    "this last equation is again exactly valid for any neighboring distance @xmath74 .",
    "the amplitude of the @xmath18 correlations , @xmath197 and @xmath198 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : a_y  p ] .",
    "the correlation length , @xmath199 and also @xmath200 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xi_y  p ] .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : a_y  p ] it can be seen that the positional correlations show mainly a non - alternating behavior when @xmath201 , but suddenly become alternating for @xmath202 .",
    "the picture is as follows : when the orientation of the particles is @xmath108 , then the correlation is weak , non - alternating , and short range ( nevertheless , the alternating part has relatively long correlation length and small amplitude , which is due to the presence of few @xmath109 particles . ) when the orientation of the particles is mainly @xmath109 , then the correlation is strong , alternating , and long range .",
    "it is interesting that the correlation length @xmath203 suddenly increases at @xmath124 but has no peak ; it is a monotonic function and diverges exponentially with @xmath124 .",
    "this kind of divergence has been also observed in other systems of hard body particles such as rectangular  @xcite or v - shaped  @xcite particles confined to a line .",
    "the divergence of @xmath203 can be explained easily as follows .",
    "if  due to a fluctuation",
    " a particle changes its position in the @xmath109 oriented zig - zag phase , then the neighboring particles are forced to follow that change to avoid forming domain walls in the zig - zag structure .",
    "this means that the correlation among the @xmath18 positions is strong .",
    "this effect becomes stronger with increasing pressure because the cost of domain walls increases , therefore the correlation length increases , too .",
    "it is interesting to see that at the level of the transfer operator the reason of this sudden change of @xmath203 is due to the fact that @xmath204 , where @xmath24 and @xmath123 produce an avoided level crossing , thus @xmath205 gets stuck between @xmath24 and @xmath123 .",
    "the orientational and @xmath18 positional degrees of freedom are not `` entangled '' , but the orientational level crossing has some impact on the positional behavior .    finally , in our opinion , this divergence of @xmath203 is not so interesting as the divergence of @xmath116 , because the latter causes an interesting behavior at finite pressure ( the peculiar behavior of the equations of state , see fig .",
    "[ fig : eta  p ] ) and also at infinite pressure ( diverging compressibility in spite of dealing with a hard system ) , but the former has not such consequences .",
    "the reason for this is that the orientational order is coupled to both physical external fields , the wall and the longitudinal pressure  see eq .",
    "[ eq : h_def] , while the alternating @xmath18 positional order is not .",
    "the zig - zag positional order would be coupled to an alternating external field , i.e. the hamiltonian should contain a @xmath206 term , which is physically unusual , @xmath207 can not be tuned by @xmath4 or @xmath3 , therefore the related quantities ( susceptibility etc . )",
    "are uninteresting .",
    "we have shown that near the @xmath208 , @xmath209 point the gibbs free energy and the orientational correlation function show a scaling behavior , so this is a critical point .",
    "we have calculated all the critical exponents and we have found that our model is in the same universality class as the 1d ising model .",
    "one can argue that there is no real critical point at any finite pressure , however , there is a real ( experimentally observable ) critical behavior in the vicinity of the critical point , which is indeed located in the physically meaningless ( experimentally unreachable ) parameter regime ( @xmath209 ) . at this fixed point",
    "the critical exponent @xmath184 , implying that the order parameter has a discontinuity .",
    "this means that this fixed point unifies the feature of a usual critical fixed point and a discontinuity fixed point of three dimensional systems .",
    "therefore , in the vicinity of this point the system behaves very similar as showing a first order transition , however , at the same time , the peaks of the compressibility and the specific heat are typically like that of a critical system .",
    "the free energy is singular at @xmath144 , therefore the discontinuity disappears at any finite @xmath4 , turning all thermodynamic functions analytic .    in spite of the similarities between our system and the 1d ising model , we want to emphasize some differences in the underlying physics .",
    "we have mentioned that in our model every particle has continuum translational @xmath15 degrees of freedom and four possible discrete states while the ising spins are localized and have only two different discrete states , but more important , in the ising model the thermal fluctuations can change the direction of a _ single spin alone _ at any temperature . certainly , when the temperature is small , the probability of spin flipping is very small too , but possible , irrespectively to the states of its neighbors . in our model",
    "the `` flipping '' of a square from the rotational state parallel to the wall ( @xmath108 ) into the other state when its diagonal is parallel to the wall ( @xmath109 ) is impossible at high densities without the disturbance of its neighbors . at high densities fluctuations can `` flip '' a square only together with many other neighbors , what is more , the positions of the squares have to be changed at the same time . _",
    "only collective motions can change the orientational state of the particles _ , which makes an important difference .",
    "we would like to add that this kind of model , namely hard particles confined into a narrow , quasi - one - dimensional channel , is often regarded as a simple model to study the glassy or jamming phenomenon , see for example refs .",
    "most of these works focus on disks confined by somewhat wider channels than ours , but the observed glassy behavior is similar since only collective rearrangements of particles can increase the density , and with increasing pressure these collective rearrangements become less probable ; the system is sticked into the so called locally jammed states .",
    "these works report interesting features such as an isobaric heat capacity maximum and a corresponding diverging pressure for some density below the maximal packing fraction .",
    "then , they conclude that these features are related to some kind of fragile - strong fluid crossover or avoided phase transition , which is phenomenologically reminiscent of the bulk glass transition . here",
    "we would like to provide an alternative point of view .",
    "we think that the almost singular behavior of the thermodynamic quantities _ below _ the close packing density can be a marker of a critical behavior related to a critical point _ at _ the close packing density . the system studied in our work",
    "gives an example for this possibility .",
    "the existence of a critical point at @xmath5 has consequences at finite @xmath124 pressures for @xmath125 , namely : @xmath210 and @xmath211 have large peaks , and the pressure goes up suddenly at a given ( below the close packing ) density .",
    "these features are very similar to those reported in connection with the fragile - strong fluid crossover or avoided phase transition .",
    "this behavior can be explained coherently by the existence of a fixed point at infinite pressure , which unifies the properties of a usual critical fixed point and a discontinuity fixed point .",
    "it remains an open question what is the relationship between the present criticality and the possible glass / jam behavior .",
    "here we would like to point out the differences .",
    "first of all , it is a long standing question whether the jamming transition has some sign in the equilibrium properties of the system or not .",
    "we emphasize that we studied only equilibrium properties . on the other hand , to understand the critical behavior in our model it is enough to take into account only two competitive structures .",
    "this contrasts with a glass , where the system have not only two , but many ( usually very much ) almost stable but actually metastable states .",
    "moreover , in our system , the reason of the existence of metastable states is the presence of the confining walls , which strongly decrease the room for rearranging configurations . finally , the existence of a merged critical _ and _ discontinuity fixed point is typical in one dimension . therefore , the extrapolation of the conclusions deduced from such quasi-1d systems to bulk 3d systems is , from our point of view , strongly questionable .",
    "another issue is the analogy between the present and the continuous models .",
    "how relevant are the presented results for the freely rotating and moving case , when all the degrees of freedom are continuous ?",
    "we have no exact answer , but we strongly believe that for the case where the @xmath18 degrees of freedom are continuous with discretized orientation , the long range orientational properties of our model can be effectively described by a @xmath212 matrix and , as a consequence , the 1d ising like critical point is preserved . but even in this case the system can not be completely resolved so easily .",
    "as we have mentioned , the orientational and @xmath18 positional degrees of freedom turn `` entangled '' and it becomes not so trivial to construct the effective @xmath52 matrix . on the other hand , treating the continuous rotational degrees of freedom is mathematically more subtle .",
    "nevertheless , physical considerations suggest that the underlying reason for the `` almost '' singular behavior at pressure @xmath110 is not the discrete nature of the ( @xmath18 and orientational ) degrees of freedom . what it is more , the extra degrees of freedom enhance the singular - like behavior even for not so strong confinement",
    ". in the discrete system studied in this paper there is nothing interesting when @xmath213 , and the curves just start to show singular - like behavior below @xmath214 , see e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : eta  p ] or [ fig : compressibility  p ] .",
    "we know that the situation is more exciting in wider channels when @xmath18 is continuous  @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the negative constant part of the external field @xmath155 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_def ] ) comes from the @xmath18 positional fluctuations .",
    "when @xmath18 is continuous , fluctuations have more room as the phase space is larger .",
    "therefore @xmath155 is more negative and favors more strongly the @xmath108 orientation .",
    "the emerging picture is as follows : @xmath18 fluctuations favor the @xmath108 orientation .",
    "therefore , by increasing the number of @xmath18-degrees of freedom the `` transition '' pressure , @xmath124 , goes up , approaching the critical point .",
    "our numerical results show  @xcite that the freely rotating case shifts its `` transition '' pressure further more to high values , although in this case it is not trivial the reason why . in this unrestricted system",
    "we have no prove of the existence of a critical point , but we strongly believe on its presence .",
