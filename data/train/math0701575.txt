    "monotone dynamical systems constitute a rich class of models , for which global and almost - global convergence properties can be established .",
    "they are particularly useful in biochemical applications and also appear in areas like coordination @xcite and other problems in control @xcite .",
    "one of the fundamental results in monotone systems theory is hirsch s generic convergence theorem @xcite .",
    "informally stated , hirsch s result says that almost every bounded solution of a strongly monotone system converges to the set of equilibria .",
    "there is a rich literature regarding the application of this powerful theorem , as well as of other results dealing with everywhere convergence when equilibria are unique ( @xcite ) , to models of biochemical systems .",
    "see for instance  @xcite for expositions and many references .",
    "unfortunately , many models in biology are not monotone , at least with respect to any standard orthant order .",
    "this is because in monotone systems ( with respect to orthant orders ) every net feedback loop should be positive , but , on the other hand , in many systems negative feedback loops often appear as well , as they are required for adaptation and precision .",
    "however , intuitively , negative loops that act at a comparatively fast time scale should not affect the main characteristics of monotone behavior .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to show that this is indeed the case , in the sense that singularly perturbed strongly monotone systems inherit generic convergence properties .",
    "a system that is not monotone may become monotone once that fast variables are replaced by their steady - state values . in order to prove a precise time - separation result",
    ", we employ tools from geometric singular perturbation theory .",
    "this point of view is of special interest in the context of biochemical systems ; for example , michaelis menten kinetics are mathematically justified as singularly perturbed versions of mass action kinetics  @xcite .",
    "one particular example of great interest in view of current systems biology research is that of `` futile cycle '' motifs , as illustrated in figure [ fig : scheme ] .     is ultimately converted into a product @xmath0 , in an `` activation '' reaction triggered or facilitated by an enzyme @xmath1 , and , conversely",
    ", @xmath0 is transformed back ( or `` deactivated '' ) into the original @xmath2 , helped on by the action of a second enzyme @xmath3 . ]",
    "as discussed in  @xcite , futile cycles ( with any number of intermediate steps , and also called substrate cycles , enzymatic cycles , or enzymatic interconversions ) underlie signaling processes such as gtpase cycles @xcite , bacterial two - component systems and phosphorelays @xcite actin treadmilling @xcite ) , and glucose mobilization @xcite , as well as metabolic control @xcite and cell division and apoptosis @xcite and cell - cycle checkpoint control @xcite .",
    "a most important instance is that of mitogen - activated protein kinase ( `` mapk '' ) cascades , which regulate primary cellular activities such as proliferation , differentiation , and apoptosis @xcite in eukaryotes from yeast to humans .",
    "mapk cascades usually consist of three tiers of similar structures with multiple feedbacks @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . here",
    "we focus on one individual level of a mapk cascade , which is a futile cycle as depicted in figure [ fig : scheme ] .",
    "the precise mathematical model is described later .",
    "numerical simulations of this model have suggested that the system may be monostable or bistable , see @xcite . the later will give rise to switch - like behavior , which is ubiquitous in cellular pathways ( @xcite ) . in either case , the system under meaningful biological parameters shows convergence , not other dynamical properties such as periodic behavior or even chaotic behavior .",
    "analytical studies done for the quasi - steady - state version of the model ( slow dynamics ) , which is a monotone system , indicate that the reduced system is indeed monostable or bistable , see @xcite .",
    "thus , it is of great interest to show that , at least in certain parameter ranges ( as required by singular perturbation theory ) , the full system inherits convergence properties from the reduced system , and this is what we do as an application of our results .    a feature of our approach , as in other control problems @xcite , @xcite , is the use of geometric invariant manifold theory @xcite .",
    "there is a manifold @xmath4 , invariant for the full dynamics of a singularly perturbed system , which attracts all near - enough solutions .",
    "however , we need to exploit the full power of the theory , and especially the fibration structure and an asymptotic phase property .",
    "the system restricted to the invariant manifold @xmath4 is a regular perturbation of the slow ( @xmath5@xmath6@xmath7 ) system .",
    "as remarked in theorem 1.2 in hirsch s early paper  @xcite , a @xmath8 regular perturbation of a flow with eventually positive derivatives also has generic convergence properties .",
    "so , solutions in the manifold will generally be well - behaved , and asymptotic phase implies that solutions near @xmath9 track solutions in @xmath4 , and hence also converge to equilibria if solutions on @xmath4 do .",
    "a key technical detail is to establish that the tracking solutions also start from the `` good '' set of initial conditions , for generic solutions of the large system .",
    "a preliminary version of these results was presented at the 2006 conference on decision and control , and dealt with the special case of singularly perturbed systems of the form : @xmath10 on a product domain , where @xmath11 is a constant hurwitz matrix and the reduced system @xmath12 is strongly monotone .",
    "however , for the application to the above futile cycle , there are two major problems with that formulation : first , the dynamics of the fast system have to be allowed to be nonlinear in @xmath13 , and second , it is crucial to allow for an @xmath14-dependence on the right - hand side as well as to allow the domain to be a polytope depending on @xmath14 .",
    "we provide a much more general formulation here .",
    "we note that no assumptions are imposed regarding global convergence of the reduced system , which is essential because of the intended application to multi - stable systems .",
    "this seems to rule out the applicability of lyapunov - theoretic and iss tools  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the main result is stated in section [ state ] . in section [ pre ] , we review some basic definitions and theorems about monotone systems .",
    "the detailed proof of the main theorem can be found in section [ proof ] , and applications to the mapk system and another set of ordinary differential equations are discussed in section [ application ] . finally , in section [",
    "conclusion ] , we summarize the key points of this paper .",
    "in this paper , we focus on the dynamics of the following prototypical system in singularly perturbed form : @xmath15 we will be interested in the dynamics of this system on a time - varying domain @xmath16 . for @xmath17 ,",
    "the variable @xmath18 changes much slower than @xmath13 . as long as @xmath19 ,",
