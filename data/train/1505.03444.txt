    "<S> this intuitive picture is at the very heart of the scaling hypothesis which distinguishes between metallic and insulating states on the basis of the range of @xmath5 : if the electronic states at the chemical potential @xmath13 are extended , then the system is a metal , but if they have a finite extent , the system is an insulator . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the metallic state is defined by @xmath0 independent of system dimensions , whereas the insulating state is characterized by @xmath0 decaying with increasing system dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> this underlies the anderson metal - to - insulator transition in which a `` mobility - edge '' in wave vector @xmath14-space demarcates short - ranged and long - ranged states  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> , the electronic wave function will have a very large extent , and it is reasonable to expect that @xmath71 is intensive @xmath88 , where d is the dimensionality of the system under study . in the latter , where disorder is strong and the electronic wave function is localized , </S>",
    "<S> conduction is governed by the spatial overlap of neighboring states . </S>",

    "<S> it is noteworthy that fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] provides evidence of finite @xmath5 within the wl regime where @xmath94 where the subscript denotes `` scaling theory '' .    </S>",
    "<S> thus the picture emerges that the 2degs studied are , in fact , in the weakly localized regime but with @xmath0 significantly reduced due to the finite extent of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the weak dependence and even positive slope of @xmath41 against @xmath1 are entirely expected . </S>",
    "<S> the question then arises as to why above 1  k the 2degs show activated transport . </S>",
    "<S> the point here is that the metallic character below 1  k is imparted by the relatively long @xmath95 electronic states at @xmath96 , but states with @xmath97 , which nominally do not contribute to transport due to phase space restrictions , are continually hopping due to inelastic interactions with phonons . </S>",
    "<S> these therefore provide an additional transport channel with an activated form . </S>",
    "<S> we thus propose a simple `` parallel - resistor '' model to understand the @xmath1-dependence of @xmath41 in which the conducting states ( at @xmath96 ) and hopping states ( at @xmath98 ) conduct in parallel :    @xmath99    here @xmath100 is the contribution due to the effectively extended states assumed to be @xmath1 independent , and the second term on the right is the hopping term . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](c ) , we are able to obtain excellent fits to the data using @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath27 as fitting parameters . </S>",
    "<S> values of the resulting fit parameters are listed in table  [ tab1 ] . a noteworthy , though small , feature that the model does not capture is the mildly positive @xmath102 seen at @xmath103  2  k@xmath104 in the lower - middle panel of fig .  [ fig1](c ) ( see also ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . however , this is trivially so due to the assumption of constant @xmath100 which disregards effects such as electron screening  @xcite and interelectron interactions  @xcite , including which will , no doubt , result in more accurate models .    </S>",
    "<S> we now return to our assumption that @xmath105 , which is a necessary requirement for coherent electron interference and , thus , for localization effects to manifest . as @xmath106 phase coherence is lost , and it is to be expected that localization phenomena be suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> we see clear evidence of this in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](c ) , where @xmath51 gradually diminishes to 0 as @xmath1 increases .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it is observed that at a fixed @xmath1 , decreasing @xmath56 also diminishes @xmath51 , which is consistent with an anderson - like transition to a metallic state  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the @xmath49-dependence can be seen simply as a consequence of @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the thermopower @xmath107 of similar 2degs displays strong oscillations and even sign changes  @xcite which might have their origin in phase coherent transport  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , there are several indications that electrons retain phase coherence over the length of the devices studied . </S>",
    "<S> this is a remarkable observation given that ( i ) the largest 2degs have @xmath108 m , which is significantly longer than conventionally measured @xmath35 ( see , for example , ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , and ( ii ) the @xmath4 dependence is seen even at 10 k. we comment on why this might be so further on in the paper but at this stage emphasize the strong applicability of the systems studied in quantum information schemes </S>",

    "<S> the experimental data is in clear agreement with the theoretically predicted limiting values ( shown as broken lines ) for @xmath113 and @xmath114 , where @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> the red lines are guide to the eyes.,width=312 ]    before presenting our concluding remarks , we first consider the important issues of ( i ) the background disorder potential the 2degs reside in  @xcite and ( ii ) interelectron interactions . implicit in our analysis based on the scaling hypothesis is the assumption that the background disorder experienced by the various 2degs is statistically homogeneous . </S>",
    "<S> however , we believe this assumption to be amply justified by the systematic @xmath41 vs @xmath4 trend observed in all three sets of 2degs : d9 , d11 and d3  @xcite . we have also found this trend to be reproducible between cooldowns , albeit with marginally different pinch - off characteristics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it seems reasonable to believe that the statistical degree of inhomogeneity in the disorder is small , perhaps responsible for the departures from perfect linearity in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) and [ fig2](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is also conceivable that `` fluctuations '' in @xmath5 due to the mesoscopic nature of the 2degs are influencing transport  @xcite . in other words , it is possible that the small scale of the 2deg facilitates observation of certain ballistic electron trajectories which are not observable at longer length scales . </S>",
    "<S> however , we believe we have minimized the effect of such nonergodicities by ( i ) working at @xmath49 values where @xmath116 [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](a ) and also ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ] and ( ii ) averaging our data over long times before recording  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the second important point to consider is that of interelectron interactions which , importantly , must be present in the 2degs since the interaction parameter @xmath117 , which is the ratio of the coulomb energy @xmath118 and kinetic energy @xmath119 of the electrons =  @xmath120 , attains values as large as 5 in our studies . </S>",
    "<S> however , as was demonstrated recently in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , qualitative changes in @xmath6 are not expected even in the presence of strong interactions , and this is consistent with our findings . </S>",
    "<S> it will be interesting to understand whether the recently observed strong enhancement in the magnitude of @xmath107 measured in similar 2degs  @xcite or the observed violation of the mott formula  @xcite , where @xmath107 and @xmath41 were observed to oscillate asynchronously , reflect strong interaction effects or not . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , we also wish to point out the similarities between our experimental results and the phenomenology of many - body delocalized phases in translationally - invariant 2d systems  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while it is debatable whether our experimental system stringently fulfills the criteria for many - body delocalization , namely complete isolation from the environment , we note that this is certainly consistent with the lack of electron decoherence even at @xmath121k .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion we emphasize that the observed @xmath4 dependence of @xmath0 in mesoscopic 2degs is strongly consistent with the scaling hypothesis , which in turn suggests that the 2degs are , in fact , in the @xmath122  1 regime , but perceptibly anderson localized , i.e. , with @xmath0 suppressed due to the finite @xmath5 . in macroscopic 2degs where @xmath123 , conductivity scaling may not be apparent since blocks of size @xmath124 contribute in an incoherent fashion . nevertheless , it is important to note that as long as @xmath125 the conductivity of such a block _ must _ be diminished from its value at size @xmath126 , rendering imprecise the identification that @xmath127 . </S>",
    "<S> the observation of scaling - like behavior at length scales of several @xmath13 m and at temperatures of @xmath128  10k suggest the system under study to be remarkably robust to decoherence effects . </S>",
    "<S> while we do not fully understand why this might be , we speculate that this has to do with the specific device geometry  @xcite in which the ohmic contacts are at a large spatial separation from the 2degs being studied . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the primary link the 2degs have to the environment is the tenuous low-@xmath1 electron - phonon coupling which might be further weakened due to the narrow mesa widths employed  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , this opens up several possibilities towards studying many - body localized electron phases  @xcite .    </S>",
