    "the photon production rate is thought to be a quantity of phenomenological interest in heavy ions collisions , possibly enabling one to detect the formation of a quark - gluon plasma .",
    "part of the interest in this electromagnetic observable comes from the fact that photons are relatively weakly coupled to nuclear matter ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "given the typical size of the system in such collisions ( much smaller than the mean free path of a photon ) , they do not re - interact between their production and their observation . as a consequence , photons ( real photons , or virtual photons decaying eventually into a lepton pair )",
    "can provide information on the state of the system at the time they were produced .    in order to calculate the photon yield from a hot quark - gluon plasma ,",
    "thermal field theory is the tool of choice since its feynman rules automatically take into account the presence of a thermal bath with the appropriate distributions of partons .",
    "thermal gauge theories are however plagued by infrared singularities arising from the bose - einstein distribution functions which are singular at zero energy .",
    "an improvement over the bare feynman rules is achieved by the resummation of one - loop thermal contributions known as hard thermal loops ( htl ) @xcite .",
    "these thermal corrections make it possible to include in the propagators effects like debye screening or landau damping , and transform partons into massive quasi - particles . from a quantitative perspective , they provide important changes to the dynamics of soft modes ( of momentum of order @xmath2 or less ) .",
    "this resummation lacks however two features : it does not provide any debye screening for static magnetic fields ( such a screening is expected to arise non - perturbatively in qcd at the length scale @xmath3 ) , and its quasi - particles do not undergo collisions ( their collisional , while in qed / qcd the former starts at the order @xmath4 .",
    "the width @xmath5 that we introduce in this paper is the collisional width , and its inverse is the mean free path of the quark in the plasma .",
    "] width is also a sub - leading effect of order @xmath6 ) .    in the framework of thermal field theory ,",
    "the photon / dilepton rate is obtained via the calculation of the imaginary part of the retarded photon polarization tensor @xcite .",
    "this object has been evaluated at one - loop in the htl - improved perturbative expansion , both for virtual @xcite and real photons @xcite .",
    "more recently , new processes like bremsstrahlung were studied in detail in this framework and have been found to be dominant sources of low invariant mass photons @xcite . despite the fact that this process arrives only in 2-loop contributions to the photon polarization tensor , it is always important because of a strong collinear enhancement .",
    "indeed , it was found in @xcite that for a very small photon invariant mass , the corresponding diagram contains collinear singularities that , when regularized by a thermal quark mass of order @xmath2 , give an enhancement by a factor of order @xmath7 over naive estimates coming from power counting .    after finding that certain 2-loop terms are contributing at leading order",
    ", one may wonder whether this result is specific to this 2-loop contribution only or if , on the contrary , this is an indication of the breakdown of perturbative expansion ( even improved with htls ) .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite , we studied what is the effect of loop corrections to this 2-loop diagram .",
    "power counting indeed indicates a problem very similar to the problem raised by linde @xcite for the calculation of the free energy , due to the lack of debye screening for static magnetic modes .",
    "this problem is avoided for the production of massive enough photons , because some cancellations ( occuring within any given topology , when one is summing over all the cuts contributing to the imaginary part ) generate a kinematical cutoff large enough to prevent any sensitivity to the non - perturbative scale @xmath8 . unfortunately , this cutoff is smaller than @xmath8 whenever the invariant mass of the produced photon is too small ( typically @xmath9 for @xmath10 ) . in this low invariant mass region ,",
    "the photon rate is therefore non perturbative : exchanged transverse gluons reach the scale @xmath8 of the non - perturbative `` magnetic mass '' , and an infinite set of diagrams must be resummed .    in this paper",
    ", we present a completely different approach to higher order corrections , that completes the picture outlined in @xcite . the idea behind",
    "the present study is that a width on the quark propagator will act as a regulator in the collinear sector , because it moves the poles of the propagator away from the real energy axis .",
    "such a collisional width is necessarily a higher - loop effect , because the hard thermal loop framework does not take into account the collisions of quasi - particles .",
    "having in mind the fact that 2-loop contributions are important because of collinear enhancement , an important question to answer is how much of this enhancement is lost when an additional regulator like a width is taken into account .",
    "this is the question we want to address in this paper , by calculating the same 2-loop diagrams as in @xcite , in the presence of a quark width . to be more definite , and keep the model as well as the calculations simple",
    ", we use a momentum - independent width .",
    "a word of caution is necessary here : the formulae found using this simple model should not be taken as an accurate quantitative account of what the effect of such a width will be on thermal photon production rates .",
    "indeed , the constant width model is probably too naive to be realistic , and more importantly our calculation disregards the fact that a modification of the vertices should in principle accompany the modification of the quark propagators . nevertheless , this simple approach is sufficient here for our purpose which is just to determine the region in which effects of a width of order @xmath6 are to be expected , since that gives another handle on how and when higher order corrections may affect photon production by a quark - gluon plasma .",
    "we find that the region where a width of order @xmath6 is important is very similar to the one found in @xcite for the contribution of higher - loop topologies due to an ir sensitivity to the scale of the magnetic mass . despite their similarity",
    ", these two non perturbative regions have different physical interpretations .",
    "in particular , we find that the sensitivity to the collisional width of the quarks is a manifestation of the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal effect . indeed , it occurs when the formation time of the photon is larger than the mean free path of the quark producing the photon . an interesting consequence of our study is that the lpm effect also modifies the spectrum of highly energetic photons .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "section [ sec : model ] makes more precise our modeling of the mean free path for the quarks . in section [ sec:1-loop ] ,",
    "we start by computing the 1-loop contribution in presence of a width .",
    "although not related to collinear singularities in any way , the purpose of this warmup exercise is two - fold : it illustrates the technology ( how one does calculations with a width ) , and it shows in a simple way how collisions can open up the phase space .",
    "we also show that this 1-loop contribution is canceled by the resummation of vertex corrections , and is therefore not physical .",
    "in section [ sec:2-loop - calcul ] , we present the 2-loop calculation with a quark width , and obtain a rather simple generalization of the formulae of @xcite .",
    "these formulae are discussed extensively in section [ sec:2-loop - discussion ] , in which we also determine the region where a width of order @xmath6 plays an important role .",
    "section [ sec : lpm ] is devoted to establishing the connection between the previous results and the lpm effect . in section [ sec : annihilation ] , we study the process obtained from bremsstrahlung by crossing symmetry , which turns out to be important in the region of large photon energy .",
    "we show that this process is also affected by the lpm effect .",
    "the last section contains concluding remarks .",
    "in particular , we combine the present work on the lpm effect with previous results on infrared singularities @xcite in order to make a syntesis and present a reasonable physical picture of thermal photon production .",
    "let us first make our framework more definite . the only modification compared to the context extensively described in @xcite",
    "is that the quark propagators are given a width , as outlined by the following substitution in the retarded and advanced propagators : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the usual asymptotic thermal mass for hard quarks @xcite , and where @xmath5 is a constant width . the expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq : propagator ] ) is sufficient for the physics we consider , which is dominated by hard quark momenta close to the mass shell . whenever we need",
    "to estimate the order of magnitude of a term containing @xmath5 in the following , we assume that it is of order @xmath6 ( with @xmath13 ) .",
    "note that we could as well have written @xmath14 since the two differ by the small correction @xmath15 to the real part of the denominator . the retarded ( resp .",
    "advanced ) propagator has two complex poles in the @xmath16 plane , located at @xmath17 ( resp .",
    "@xmath18 ) , with @xmath19 .",
    "let us now consider the simplest calculation conceivable in this framework , namely the computation of the 1-loop contribution to the photon polarization tensor .",
    "our purpose is simply to illustrate possible changes brought in when taking into account a width for the quarks running in the loop .",
    "we do not attempt a complete calculation including htl vertices , as pictured on fig .",

    "indeed , these poles are the imaginary fermionic matsubara frequencies and are to be plugged into differences like @xmath30 .",
    "the fact that @xmath31 makes these differences very small from the propagators and plugs them in the distribution functions , the latter become complex numbers .",

    "( [ eq:1-loop-1b ] ) it is of the same order .",
    "it is the collision partners of the quarks that open up the phase - space ( hard quarks colliding in the medium can emit a photon , a process forbidden for collisionless quarks ) and make these contributions so large .",
    "another property of this result is that there is a suppression if @xmath48 , such that @xmath49 tends to 0 when @xmath50 .",
    "equations similar to eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1-loop-1a ] ) and ( [ eq:1-loop-1b ] ) can be obtained when considering the contribution @xmath51 to eq .",
    "( [ eq:1-loop - modifie ] ) .",
    "this suppression was interpreted in @xcite as the manifestation of the lpm effect . however , despite the suppression at small @xmath52 , the connection with the lpm effect is not clear in this context .",
    "indeed , the lpm effect is expected when the photon formation time is larger than the quark mean free path , a condition which never appears in @xcite , nor in the above 1-loop calculation .",
    "in fact , following @xcite , we know that the propagator of a quark close to its mass shell on which a width is resummed can be evaluated by an eikonal resummation of the multiple collisions . by the same method , one can include in this resummation all the vertex corrections .",
    "indeed , one can check that the photon polarization tensor at this level of approximation is proportional to ( in space - time coordinates ) @xmath53 e^{is[a]}{\\rm tr}\\,[\\gamma^\\mu s(x , y|a ) \\gamma^\\nu s(y , x|a)]\\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath54 $ ] is the action of the gauge fields , and where @xmath55 is the propagator of a quark in the background field @xmath56 .",
    "this formula includes only one quark loop ( in addition to the quark loops that may have been resummed in the gluon propagators and vertices in @xmath54 $ ] ) , and all orders in the gluon fields . in the eikonal approximation",
    ", the quark propagator has a very simple dependence on the field @xmath57 ( which is a matrix @xmath58 in qcd ) : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the 4-velocity of the quark , and @xmath61 is the free propagator of the quark .",
    "now , if one is looking at photons of very small invariant mass , the two quarks are nearly parallel in the collinear limit ( even if the photon is hard ) , so that the two quarks have mostly the same @xmath62 . as a consequence , the two path ordered exponentials",
    "cancel each other , and the product of the propagators under the functional integral is @xmath63 therefore , at the level of approximation at which the resummed quark propagator is calculated , the sum of _ all _ the gluon loop corrections is vanishing : 1=to 6 cm @xmath64 this result generalizes a result already known for qed established by @xcite for the subset of ladder vertex corrections , and extended to all abelian topologies in @xcite , to the case where gluons are exchanged ( i.e. to non abelian topologies ) .",
    "indeed , we see that what makes gluons specific , namely the fact that they can couple to each other , is hidden in the action @xmath54 $ ] , which plays a passive role in the argument .",
    "this result is also closely related to the fact that there are no @xmath65 htl vertices ( see @xcite for an interpretation of the cancellation found in @xcite as a consequence of the absence of htl vertices with @xmath66 photons ) , because the sum of all the eikonal contributions can also be written as ( when @xmath67 is soft ) : 1=to 8 cm @xmath68 where the sum is extended to all the possible ways to close the external gluonic legs of the @xmath65 vertices . if is then obvious to see that the sum reduces to its first term if these vertices are vanishing .",
    "one is therefore left with the bare 1-loop diagram , which does not contributes to the imaginary part of the photon polarization tensor . in other words , the results derived in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1-loop-1a ] ) and ( [ eq:1-loop-1b ] ) as a warmup and that were claimed to be related to the lpm effect in @xcite , are just artifacts with no physical meaning . in section [ sec : lpm ] of the present paper , we show where the lpm effect appears in thermal field theory .    despite the fact that this contribution is not physical , one learns two things from this calculation :",
    "( 1 ) one has to keep terms beyond the eikonal approximation in order to circumvent this cancellation , and ( 2 ) the width may open the phase space to new processes .",
    "the lesson from the previous section is that physical contributions must be looked for beyond the eikonal approximation .",
    "this implies inserting explicitly a gluon exchange with momentum @xmath69 in the diagram , and not assuming that @xmath70 .",
    "there are in principle two 2-loop topologies contributing to the photon polarization tensor .",
    "however , it was found in @xcite that only the topology correcting the @xmath71 vertex ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : diagrams ] ) is relevant in the region where the collinear enhancement takes place . since our purpose it to study how this collinear enhancement is affected by the width @xmath5 , we limit the present study to the terms that were found important in @xcite",
    ".    there is though one difference with the case @xmath23 that we must take into account : with a zero width , processes corresponding to cuts @xmath72 and @xmath73 are kinematically forbidden for small @xmath74 . as in the previous section , turning on the width opens those production channels , and we can not disregard them _ a priori_. this is not a problem though from a purely technical point of view , because it turns out that the sum of all the cuts has a simpler expression than each individual piece , we show how one can obtain the difference between the cuts @xmath75 and @xmath73 .",

    "moreover , the value of the plateau is proportional to @xmath144 ( this can be deduced from the plot since @xmath5 increases by a factor @xmath142 between two consecutive curves ) .",

    "this result just tells us that the photon rate is proportional to the mean free path of the quark that emits the photon . in other words , quarks colliding very frequently do not have enough time to emit photons .",
    "this picture is at the basis of the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal effect , that we discuss in the next section .",

    "[ fig : boundary ] is the region where the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal @xcite effect modifies photon production by a plasma .",
    "let us first recall the condition for the lpm effect , by using a very heuristic argument valid for real photon production . in the bremsstrahlung process of photon production , the gluon exchanged during the scattering has a minimal momentum given by @xcite @xmath184 where @xmath185 is the momentum of the quark .",
    "the inverse of this momentum transfer defines the `` length '' on which the photon is emitted , and for this reason is called the `` coherence length '' ( denoted @xmath186 in the following ) for the production of this photon .",
    "it is also interpreted as the `` formation time '' of the photon . if @xmath186 is much smaller that the typical distance between two consecutive scatterings ( proportional to @xmath144 ) , then the photon rate is not affected by multiple scatterings . in other words , successive scatterings can be considered as independent . on the contrary , if the coherence length is larger than the mean free path , then successive scatterings are not independent anymore .",
    "this is the lpm effect .",
    "it is also possible to recast the previous condition as a comparison between the `` formation time '' and the mean free path of the quark in a very suggestive way : the photon must be produced before the quark scatters off another parton .",
    "let us now show that the previous discussion arises automatically in the thermal field theory approach .",
    "in fact , there is in the calculation presented before a quantity very similar to the coherence length discussed in the semi - classical treatment of the lpm effect , namely , @xmath187 this value agrees with the one of @xcite when @xmath188 since it comes from kinematics , and generalizes it to the case where the invariant mass @xmath74 is non vanishing .",
    "additionally , this quantity was found in @xcite to be the lower bound for the momentum of exchanged gluons .",
    "it is now possible to reformulate the condition @xmath146 in more physical terms .",
    "indeed , this condition can be rewritten as @xmath189 where @xmath190 is the mean free path of the quark in the plasma , and the region where the width dominates corresponds to the condition @xmath191 . at this point ,",
    "the connection with the lpm effect is obvious : the region we found to be non - perturbative due to the width of the quarks is also the region where the lpm effect matters .",
    "this discussion on the condition for the lpm effect to occur is in fact summarized in the expression for @xmath113 introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq : meff ] ) .",
    "this formula can be written very elegantly as : @xmath192\\ ; , \\label{eq : m_eff - compact}\\ ] ] and the physical condition for the lpm effect and the lpm effect is also mentioned in this paper . however , the condition given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : lpm - condition ] ) does not come out from the formalism of @xcite ( it seems that the approximations made in @xcite for the bremsstrahlung do not enable one to track the coherence length , so that only @xmath5 appears in the final result ) .",
    "what we have shown in the present section is that a careful calculation of the bremsstrahlung in thermal field theory generates automatically both terms of the comparison , through the effective mass given in eq .",

    "conversely , when @xmath195 , the perturbative approach is valid . as a side remark , let us note that the quantity @xmath113 , which controls the physics of bremsstrahlung , combines in a very simple way three soft scales of the problem : @xmath74 , @xmath147 and @xmath5 .",
    "it is also possible to give a very simple physical interpretation of the ratio @xmath134 which contains all the @xmath5 dependence of the final result ( eq .  ( [ eq:2-loop - final ] ) ) . indeed",
    ", one can rewrite this ratio as @xmath196 , which is nothing but the typical number of coherent scatterings necessary to produce a photon .",
    "the analogy with the standard treatment of the lpm effect is only partial though . indeed , our estimate of the effect of the finite mean free path of the quarks is too crude ( because of the constant width , and because of the missing vertex corrections ) to be reliable from a quantitative perspective .",
    "the trend found here ( suppression of the photon spectrum at small @xmath52 ) is however expected to be a solid prediction , and is in agreement with what is usually found from the lpm effect .",
    "the main difference with the usual calculation of the lpm effect comes from the treatment of scattering centers : one usually assumes a fast moving charged particle going through a medium of `` cold '' ( static ) scattering centers . in the case we are considering here , both the particle emitting the photon and",
    "the scattering centers are thermalized particles , of comparable momenta .",
    "the approximations made in @xcite do not apply to this situation , and it is not clear whether a quantitative agreement is to be expected at all . in particular , the static approximation selects only debye shielded longitudinal gluon exchanges , while the width ( the resummation of which introduces multiple scatterings in our approach ) of the thermalized quark receives contributions from transverse gluons as well .",
    "contrary to @xcite , transverse gluon exchanges are very important in thermal field theory , and matter for the lpm effect as well .",
    "there is a major difference between the lpm effect from multiple longitudinal gluon exchanges and multiple transverse gluon exchanges , which can be readily seen when one compares the respective ranges of electric and magnetic fields to the mean free path of the quark . indeed , since @xmath197 , the mean free path is much larger than the range of debye screened electric fields . as a consequence ,",
    "successive exchanges of longitudinal gluons are independent : they correspond to scatterings off different partons . on the contrary",
    ", we have @xmath198 , which implies that the range of magnetic fields can extend beyond the mean free path of the quark .",
    "therefore , successive exchanges of transverse gluons may correspond to scatterings off the same parton .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the infrared study performed in @xcite , where we found that only transverse gluons are causing trouble in the infrared sector , and that this problem occurs when @xmath199 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : condition - on - mu ] ) ) .",
    "this condition means that the production of a single photon occurs on a distance larger than the correlation length of magnetic fields : this emission process is therefore able to probe the scale of the magnetic screening , and the rate is expected to become non perturbative .",
    "this qualitative difference of transverse gluon exchanges is also supported by the fact that the contribution of longitudinal gluons to @xmath5 is perturbative ( saturated at 1-loop ) , while the transverse contribution to @xmath5 is non - perturbative @xcite .",
    "the lpm effect has already been studied in the context of photon production by a quark - gluon plasma , although with a very different approach , in @xcite . in this paper",

    "the calculation is very similar for the contribution of @xmath212 , with some peculiarities that we are going to highlight in this section .",
    "one of the most important differences is that , since we have @xmath213 , this contribution contains in fact the sum of two processes ( see fig .",

    "( [ eq:2-loop - variables ] ) , with @xmath227 in place of @xmath113 .",
    "another very important technical difference appears when one performs the integral over the quark momentum @xmath185 .",
    "indeed , the range of this integral is controlled by the statistical factors @xmath228 .",
    "this factor is of order @xmath229 in a domain going from @xmath230 to @xmath231 . in other words ,",
    "if @xmath52 is soft , this range is the usual @xmath232 $ ] interval . on the contrary , if @xmath174 , the integral extends to @xmath233 .",
    "a practical consequence is that for @xmath48 , the contribution of @xmath93 comes mainly from the bremsstrahlung of an antiquark ( since most of @xmath234 integral satisfies @xmath235 ) , while for @xmath236 it is dominated by the @xmath94 annihilation ( since we then have @xmath237 ) . in the intermediate region",
    "@xmath238 , this contribution is a mixture of both processes .",
    "again , we see that the term depending on @xmath5 in @xmath239 comes with @xmath143 , indicating that the width will modify significantly the rate when @xmath52 is soft .",
    "but , in addition , when @xmath174 , @xmath185 can itself be of order @xmath52 , so that the imaginary part of @xmath227 is of order @xmath240 , which can be much larger than @xmath147 at very large @xmath52 .",
    "it means that the width also changes dramatically the spectrum of very hard real photons ( in the case of bremsstrahlung , the width modifies only marginally the rate of hard photons , since the imaginary part of @xmath241 is of the same order of magnitude as @xmath147 if @xmath174 and @xmath242 ) coming from the @xmath94 annihilation .",

    "the inclusion of this contribution in heavy nuclei collisions simulations @xcite has lead to a good agreement with the measured rates from the wa98 experiment @xcite .",
    "these rates did not include the lpm suppression advocated here , but one must realize that the energy range where thermal photons are relevant is also the region of minimum sensitivity to the width @xmath5 ( around the minimum of the curves in figure [ fig : width - effect - in - qq ] ) , since for a temperature of a few hundred mev , the gev range corresponds to @xmath249 .",
    "it is too early to be more quantitative here given the fact that vertex corrections @xcite have been completely disregarded in the present work , but having a precise prediction for this process would definitely be of important phenomenological interest .",

    "additionally , the new topologies of the region c are at most suppressed by powers of @xmath260 if evaluated in region b.    @xmath255 region c : @xmath261 .",
    "the lpm effect still modifies photon production .",
    "in addition , the emission of a photon lasts long enough for the process to be sensitive to the magnetic screening .",
    "this is the physical meaning of the result of @xcite .",
    "diagrams with an arbitrary number of ultrasoft transverse gluons , connected in all the possible ways , must be resummed .",
    "in addition , the width included on the quarks contains non perturbative contributions due to transverse gluons @xcite , and the effective gluon vertices must be corrected to hold for ultrasoft momenta @xcite .",
    "a full study ( including vertex corrections ) of the corrections to photon production due to longitudinal gluons seems within the reach of perturbation theory , but the situation is very different in the transverse sector which seems far beyond the possibilities of perturbative methods . in this respect ,",
    "photon production is not very different from the calculation of the quark damping rate @xcite .",
    "new tools , like functional methods , transport equations , and eventually lattice techiques , are presumably the way to go in this area .",
    "in particular , the picture emerging from fig .  [",
    "fig : scales ] suggests an analogy with the successive resummations of @xcite , in which the scales @xmath36 , @xmath2 and @xmath6 are successively integrated out .",
    "indeed , going to larger and larger coherence lengths requires the inclusion of more and more complicated topologies , a procedure which amounts to integrate out degrees of freedom encountered at smaller length scales .",
    "f.g . would like to thank r. pisarski , a. peshier , r. venugopalan , d. bdeker and s. jeon for very interesting comments and discussions .",
    "thanks the institute of nuclear theory at the university of washington for its hospitality where part of this work has been done and dam thanh son for fruitful discussions .",
    "the work of f.g . is supported by doe under grant de - ac02 - 98ch10886 .",
    "equation ( [ eq:2-loop - interm ] ) includes automatically the sum of the cuts @xmath75 and @xmath73 of fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] . to see it explicitly , let us first denote @xmath262^{1/2}}}\\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , the discontinuity on the last line of eq .",
    "( [ eq:2-loop - interm ] ) equals : @xmath263}\\over{2}}\\;{\\rm disc}\\,f(\\gamma ) + { { [ f(\\gamma)+f(-\\gamma)]}\\over{2}}\\;{\\rm disc}\\,g(\\gamma)\\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the last line , the first term corresponds to cut @xmath73 and the second term gives cut @xmath75 . the fact that both cuts contribute to the photon rate when @xmath264 was to be expected .",
    "indeed , the cut @xmath73 which corresponds to the process @xmath41 is kinematically forbidden if @xmath23 , but is now allowed by the very fact that the width @xmath5 reflects the collisions of the quasi - quark ( and the channel @xmath41 is allowed in the presence of a medium ) .",
    "the integrals to be calculated are more complicated if one wants the two cuts separately .",
    "but it turns out that the difference between the two cuts is also very simple .",
    "this difference is given by : @xmath265}\\over{2}}\\;{\\rm disc}\\,g(\\gamma)- { { [ g(\\gamma)+g(-\\gamma)]}\\over{2}}\\;{\\rm disc}\\,f(\\gamma ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad = f(-\\gamma)g(\\gamma)-f(\\gamma)g(-\\gamma ) \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , in order to get @xmath266 , one has to start from eq .  ( [ eq:2-loop - interm ] ) in which the last line is substituted by @xmath267 .",
    "the same transformations can be applied to this integral , and one finally obtains an equation similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq:2-loop - final ] ) , but in which the function @xmath131 is replaced by @xmath268 this new integral is also elementary and can be obtained in closed form if needed .",
    "it is obvious that in the limit of zero width @xmath269 , the two integrals @xmath131 and @xmath270 become equal .",
    "the only way for this to happen is that the contribution of cut @xmath73 goes to zero .",
    "therefore , we recover the fact that the process @xmath41 disappears when @xmath23 ."
