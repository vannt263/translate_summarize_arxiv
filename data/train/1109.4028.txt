    "the radio - loud agns are powerful objects in which strong radio emission originate from non - thermal processes associated with the bipolar outflow from central active nuclei . in the observation of low radio frequency",
    ", they mainly consist of the radio galaxies ( rgs ) and steep - spectrum radio quasars ( ssrqs ) , such as ghz peaked spectrum sources ( gpss ) , compact steep spectrum sources ( csss ) , giant radio galaxies ( grgs ) etc .",
    "some radio galaxies have linear sizes as large as several megaparsecs , and are possibly the largest individual objects in the universe @xcite .",
    "the radio structures of radio - loud agns often show various morphologies , but a two - component structure with core and lobes ( generally showing a steep - spectrum ) is usually in common . traditionally , the ` core ' is defined as a component which is normally unresolved on arcsecond scales and has a flat spectrum .",
    "it is usually believed that the core is coincident with the active nucleus that transports energy and matter to the extended lobes by the outflow .",
    "@xcite found a statistically significant correlation between the core radio power at 5.0 ghz and the total radio power at 408 mhz which is mainly dominated by extended lobes .",
    "similar relations were also found by other authors ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in recent years ,",
    "hardcastle and his collaborators have found more relations between the properties of cores and extended lobes based on 3crr radio galaxies / qsos ( see * ? ? ?",

    ", it is not known whether the cores co - evolve with their parent radio sources . to investigate this problem , we study their radio luminosity functions ( i.e. , core and total rlf respectively ) .",
    "the rlf , presenting the space density of radio sources along with redshift and luminosity , is very important because its shape and evolution provide constraints on the nature of radio activity and the cosmic evolution of radio galaxies / qsos @xcite .",
    "many researches on the total rlf have been done ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) since @xcite performed some precursory work .",
    "@xcite found a decline of the rlf beyond @xmath0 , e.g. so - called redshift cut - off .",
    "@xcite calculated the rlf of cores based on a sample of 54 bright elliptical galaxies identified with radio sources of the b2 catalogue .",
    "however , they did not present any evolution of radio cores with redshift .",
    "after then , the research on the rlf of the cores is rare . because the cores are often unresolved and variable , it is not easy to establish a desirable sample of cores with reliable radio flux . in recent years",
    ", the fluxes of cores in many sources were obtained by very large array ( vla ) , australia telescope compact array ( atca ) , parkes - tidbinbilla real - time interferometer ( pti ) , and very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) . in this paper , we establish a large combined sample of radio galaxies / qsos by collecting data from the literature .",
    "many sources have 5 ghz core flux ( 57.1% ) , total flux at 408 mhz ( 100% ) and redshifts ( 97.0% ) .",
    "we then derive the core rlf at 5 ghz and total rlf at 408 mhz respectively , and compare their properties to study the co - evolution in detail .",
    "the sources in our sample are all steep - spectrum ones which mainly consist of radio galaxies and steep - spectrum qsos .",
    "the flat - spectrum counterparts of these sources are flat - spectrum qsos and bl lacs . in the light of unified scheme of agns ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the steep - spectrum sources are inclined at larger angles to the observer .",
    "this ` edge - on ' character make it possible to observe the extended lobes and radio cores at the same time .",
    "in addition , the radio cores in steep - spectrum sources are less affected by doppler - boosting compared with that in flat - spectrum sources .",
    "therefore we use steep - spectrum sources to study the evolution relationship between the cores and their extended radio emission .    throughout the paper , we adopt a lambda cold dark matter cosmology with the parameters @xmath1 = 0.27 , @xmath2 = 0.73 , and @xmath3 = 71 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 .",
    "in general , to construct the rlf of radio sources , a complete sample consisting of every radio sources in a certain area on the sky brighter than a specified flux limit at the selection frequency is required .",
    "a set of independent complete samples in different surveys with different flux limit can also be combined together into one ` coherent ' sample @xcite . in the paper",
    "we construct such a coherent sample combined with four independent complete samples ( described below ) totalling 1063 sources .",

    "the main result of this paper is the strikingly different evolution of the ` cores ' of radio sources compared to their extended radio emission .",
    "it is already known that the number density of extragalactic radio sources with both steep - spectrum and flat - spectrum increase sharply from @xmath61 to @xmath62 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "especially for the flat - spectrum sources , they are believed to be dominated by cores .",
    "we argue that although the flat - spectrum sources are dominated by cores , they can not be regarded as pure cores after all .",

    "this make the rlf of flat - spectrum sources more obscure .",
    "thus we have no reason to believe that their evolution of number density must be in agreement with the radio cores .",
    "the striking evolution of the radio cores induce us to reexamine what a radio core is .",
    "thus a brief review of the radio cores is worthwhile . in the standard interpretation ,",
    "the core is taken to be the optically thick base of the jet @xcite .",
    "this has been proved to be indeed the case as shown by vlbi maps @xcite .",
    "as @xcite modeled , after the jet formed , the flow will be firstly accelerated in a nozzle close to the disk , then it will expand adiabatically , enclosing the magnetic field and showing up as the compact core .",
    "the radio core emission , which is generally thought to be self - absorbed nonthermal synchrotron emission originate in the inner jet @xcite , has a high degree of polarization , a high brightness temperature @xcite , and typically a flat spectral slope at radio wavelengths .",
    "due to synchrotron self - absorption , the absolute position of the observed vlbi core shifts systematically with frequency , moving increasingly outward along the vlbi jet with lower frequency @xcite .",
    "as shown in fig.7 and fig.8 , the comoving number density of radio cores presents a persistent decline with redshift , implying a negative density evolution .",
    "it seems that the core radio emission could be gradually powered by central engines with cosmic epoch , or the radio - loudness of the cores be epoch - dependent .",
    "specifically , the radio loudness of the cores may be weaker in earlier epoch , and fewer cores can be observed in radio emission .",
    "indeed , amongst the galaxies harbouring an agn , only a small fraction ( about 10% ) appear to be luminous at radio wavelengths @xcite , and there have been suggestions that the radio loudness may be epoch - dependent ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite and @xcite found that there is a strong correlation between radio loudness and eddington ratio ( @xmath63 , the ratio of bolometric luminosity to eddington luminosity ) , indicating that radio loudness decreases with increasing @xmath63 .",
    "both studies used the @xmath64 parameter , defined as the ratio of the monochromatic 5 ghz radio luminosity to the 4400  optical luminosity ( @xmath65 ) , to characterize the degree of radio loudness .",
    "@xcite used the total luminosity ( i.e. , including nuclear and extended emission ) to evaluate the radio loudness , while @xcite only took into account the nuclear emission . in spite of the difference ,",
    "the trends of decreasing radio loudness with increasing eddington ratio were consistent .",
    "@xcite argued that the difference between radio loud and radio weak is established already on the parsec scale .",
    "therefore the above trends actually characterize the property of cores , implying the radio loudness of cores to be lower in early epochs .",
    "these trends are consistent with the property of core rlf we obtained .    the epoch - dependent radio loudness was also found by @xcite . using a sample of more than 30,000 optically selected quasars from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , they found the radio - loud fraction of quasars is a strong function of redshift , i.e. , the radio - loud fraction decreases rapidly with increasing redshift .",
    "they also used the @xmath64 parameter to characterize the degree of radio loudness , and chose @xmath66 to define radio - loud quasars .",
    "it is shown that the radio loudness of quasars are weaker at higher redshifts , thus the fraction of radio loud quasars is lower in earlier epochs . considering that most of the radio loud quasars in their sample are core - dominated fr i instead of fr ii , their result that the radio - loud fraction of quasars negatively evolves with redshift is also in agreement with our result of core rlf .",
    "besides , as a good supplement to the above studies , @xcite investigated how the radio loud fraction of agns changed as a function of eddington ratio .",
    "they found that 4.7% of the agns in their flux - limited subsample are radio loud based on core radio emission alone .",
    "the radio loud fraction decreases from 13% to 2% as eddington ratio increases over 2.5 orders of magnitude .",
    "this result is consistent with the above findings , and also supports the result of our core rlf .",
    "interestingly , it has become increasingly clear that many aspects of bh accretion and jet formation are directly comparable between agns and x - ray binary ( xrb ) systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the xrbs may help one to understand the radio emission evolution of agns .",
    "studies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown that the jet power associated with radio emission , as well as the radiative efficiency of the accretion flow , can change dramatically among different accretion states for xrbs . in the so - called low / hard state",
    ", the eddington ratio is very low ( below about 0.01 ) , and a compact self - absorbed jet with radio flat spectrum appears . with the arrival of higher eddington ratios , sources can switch into ` softer ' states in which the radio emission is dramatically suppressed or even quenching .",
    "it implies a scenario of jet formation that the jet contributing radio emission is more easily produced in sources with lower accretion ratio . for agns , the eddington ratios trend to be higher in early epochs and suppress the production of jet contributing radio emission ,",
    "their core radio emission is then weaker at higher refshifts .",
    "when the eddington ratios decrease with decreasing redshifts , agns easily produce the jet to contribute strong core radio emission .",
    "our core rlf confirms that the jet is more easily formed in sources with lower accretion ratio .",
    "it is well known that the cores and the extended lobes are related in matter and energy by jet . the core - total power correlation ( see fig.6 ) is thus the immediate representation of this relation .",
    "our results indicate that , however , they behave different evolution pattern and could not be co - evolving .",
    "we believe that some factors could affect their evolution connection .",
    "firstly , the long distance between the core and lobe delays the exchange of matter and energy , and weaken their co - evolution . for a 100-kpc agn jet",
    ", we see the core change up to 1 myr earlier than the near lobe , assuming a jet velocity of 0.1c ( c is the velocity of light ) . besides",
    ", the lobes are inevitably affected by intergalactic environment , leading to the evolution uncertainty . the lobes",
    "expand in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , while the cores are located in interstellar medium .",
    "different environments ( such as magnetic field and particle number density ) will lead distinct energy loss processes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "compared with lobes , the radio radiation properties of cores are more sensitive to the accretion states of central bhs . as enormous reservoirs of energy and relativistic electrons , the lobes ,",
    "even if the radio cores have been quenching , may still remain detectable for a long time if they are subject only to radiative losses of the relativistic electrons @xcite .",
    "assuming a typical magnetic intensity of 1.5 nt ( 1 nt = 10@xmath67 g , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the lobes , the fading time of the lobes at 408 mhz is estimated as , @xmath68 which is about @xmath69 years .",
    "the episodic agn activity could also affect the connection of evolution between lobes and cores .",
    "there has been a growing body of evidence to suggest that agn activity could be episodic , although the range of time scales involved needs to be investigated further ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "during the phase of inactivity , the energy supply from core to extended regions ceases and a source is expected to undergo a period of fading before it disappears completely @xcite . in this case , sources may lack certain features , such as radio cores or well - defined jets that are produced by continuing activity .",
    "comparatively , the radio lobes are not so sensitive to continuing activity than radio cores . alternatively , during the phase of reactivation",
    ", one may expect to observe fossil radio lobes remaining from an earlier active epoch , along with newly restarting jets and cores @xcite . in this case , the lobes are already disconnected from the currently active jets and cores .",
    "we concentrate our efforts on the study of the correlation between radio galaxies / qsos and their cores via radio luminosity functions . using a large combined sample of 1063 radio - loud agns selected at low radio frequency , we investigate the radio luminosity function ( rlf ) at 408 mhz band .",
    "we also estimate the core rlf at 5 ghz band based on the 3crr sample and the combined sample .",
    "main results are follow as :    1 .   in agrement with previous results , we note a strong correlation between core and total radio power for rgs and qsos , but the correlations has large dispersion , especially for qsos . we find that the total power of rgs more strongly depend on core radio power compared to qsos .",
    "2 .   looking at the possible existence of",
    "a ` redshift cut - off ' , the steep - spectrum rlfs we obtained do not show an obvious density decline for powerful radio sources beyond @xmath70 over the whole luminosity range .",
    "we argue that the evolution of radio agns is luminosity - dependent , while the so - called ` redshift cut - off ' in steep - spectrum population is not obvious in our result of rlfs .",
    "the core rlfs we obtained show that the comoving number density of radio cores has a persistent decline with redshift , implying a negative density evolution .",
    "we believe that the radio core emission could be gradually powered by central engines , or their radio - loudness be epoch dependent .",
    "it is noticed that the core rlf is obviously different from the total rlf at 408 mhz band which is mainly contributed by extended lobes , implying that the core and extended lobes could not be co - evolving at radio emission .",
