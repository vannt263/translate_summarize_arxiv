    "semi - markov chains ( smc ) are a wide class of stochastic processes which generalize at the same time both markov chains and renewal processes .",
    "the main advantage of smc is that they allow the use of whatever type of waiting time distribution for modeling the time to have a transition from one state to another . on the contrary ,",
    "markovian models have constraints on the distribution of the waiting times in the states which should be necessarily represented by memoryless distributions ( exponential or geometric for continuous and discrete time cases respectively ) .",
    "this major flexibility has a price to pay : the parameters to be estimated are more numerous . + smc generalizes also non - markovian models based on continuous time random walks extensively used in the econophysics community , see for example @xcite .",
    "smc have been used to analyze financial data and to describe different problems ranging from credit rating data modeling @xcite to the pricing of options @xcite as well as for wind energy modeling which shares similar problems with the modeling of financial data such as the strong persistence of data , see @xcite .    with the financial industry becoming fully computerized ,",
    "the amount of recorded data , from daily close all the way down to tick - by - tick level , has exploded .",
    "nowadays , such tick - by - tick high - frequency data are readily available for practitioners and researchers alike @xcite .",
    "it seemed then natural trying to verify the semi - markov hypothesis of returns on high - frequency data , see @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we proposed a semi - markov model showing its ability to reproduce some stylized empirical facts such for example the absence of autocorrelations in returns and the gain / loss asymmetry . in that paper",
    "we showed also that the autocorrelation in the square of returns is higher with respect to the markov model .",
    "unfortunately this autocorrelation was still too small compared to the empirical one . in order to overcome the problem of low autocorrelation , in another paper @xcite we proposed an indexed semi - markov model for price return .",
    "more precisely we assumed that the intraday returns ( up to one minute frequency ) are described by a discrete time homogeneous semi - markov process where we introduced a memory index which takes into account the periods of different volatility in the market .",
    "it is well known that the market volatility is autocorrelated , then periods of high ( low ) volatility may persist for long time .",
    "we made the hypothesis that the kernel of the semi - markov process depend on which level of volatility the market is at that time .",
    "it is to be remarked that the weighted memory index is a stochastic process which do depend on the same markov renewal chain to which the semi - markov chain is associated .",
    "then , in our model , the high autocorrelation is obtained endogenously without introducing external or latent auxiliary stochastic processes . to improve further our previous results , in @xcite",

    "<S> in this paper we describe three stochastic models based on a semi - markov chains approach and its generalizations to study the high frequency price dynamics of traded stocks . </S>",
    "<S> the three models are : a simple semi - markov chain model , an indexed semi - markov chain model and a weighted indexed semi - markov chain model . </S>",
    "<S> we show , through monte carlo simulations , that the models are able to reproduce important stylized facts of financial time series as the persistence of volatility . in particular , we analyzed high frequency data from the italian stock market from the first of january 2007 until end of december 2010 and we apply to it the semi - markov chain model and the indexed semi - markov chain model . </S>",
    "<S> the last model , instead , is applied to data from italian and german stock markets from january 1 , 2007 until the end of december 2010 .    </S>",
