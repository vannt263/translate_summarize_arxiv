    "related self - driven many - particle systems have attracted considerable interests not only from engineers but also from physicists  @xcite . among such models ,",
    "the optimal velocity model  @xcite , which successfully shows a formation of `` phantom traffic jams '' in the high - density regime , is a car - following model describing an adaptation to the optimal velocity that depends on the distance from the vehicle ahead .    whereas the ov model consists of ordinary differential equations ( ode ) , cellular automata ( ca ) such as the nagel  schreckenberg model  @xcite , the elementary ca of rule 184 ( eca184 )  @xcite , the fukui ",
    "ishibashi ( fi ) model  @xcite and the slow - to - start ( s2s ) model  @xcite are extensively used in analyses of traffic flow . recently ,",
    "takahashi and matsukidaira proposed a discrete ov ( dov ) model , which enables an ultradiscretization of the ov model  @xcite .",
    "the resultant ultradiscrete ov ( uov ) model includes both the eca184 and the fi model as its special cases .",
    "however , the s2s effect remains to be included in their ultradiscretization .",
    "the aim of this letter is to present an ultradiscretizable hybrid of the ov and the s2s models .",
    "imagine many cars running in one direction on a single - lane highway .",
    "let @xmath0 denote the position of the @xmath1-th car at time @xmath2 .",
    "no overtaking is assumed so that @xmath3 holds for arbitrary time @xmath2 .",
    "the time - evolution of the ov model  @xcite is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the velocity of the @xmath1-th car and the interval between the cars @xmath1 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "a function @xmath8 and a constant @xmath9 represent an optimal velocity and sensitivity of drivers , or the delay of drivers response , in other words .",
    "since the current velocity and the current interval between the car ahead determine the acceleration through the time - evolution and the optimal velocity , we classify the ov model  ( [ def : aov ] ) as the acceleration - control type ( aov ) . on the other hand , the ov model of the velocity - control type ( vov ) was proposed in earlier studies of the car - following models  @xcite , @xmath10 replacement of @xmath2 in the above equation ( [ def : vov ] ) with @xmath11 and the taylor series of @xmath12 yield @xmath13 which is rewritten as @xmath14 thus we note that the aov model ( [ def : aov ] ) is given by neglection of the higher derivatives in the taylor series of the vov model ( [ def : vov ] ) .",
    "though the aov model is more common in the studies on vehicle traffic , we shall concentrate on an ultradiscretizable hybrid of the vov and the s2s models .",
    "thus we call the vov model ( [ def : vov ] ) simply as the ov model , hereafter",
    ".    note that the input to the ov function  @xmath15 in the ov model  ( [ def : vov ] ) is the headway at a single point of time @xmath16 that is prior to the present time @xmath2 .",
    "thus we may say that the ov model describes , in a sense , `` reckless '' drivers since the model pays no attention to the headway between the time @xmath16 and the present time @xmath2 . on the other hand , `` cautious '' drivers governed by the s2s model  @xcite keep watching and require enough length of headway to go on for a certain period of time before they restart their cars .",
    "the contrast between the two models suggests the idea that the s2s effect and the ov model can be brought together by appropriately choosing an effective distance @xmath17 containing information on the headway for a certain period of time going back from the present as an input to the ov function  @xmath15 .",
    "we shall see this idea works in what follows .",
    "what is crucial in the ultradiscretization of the aov model  @xcite is the choice of the ov function , @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are positive constants . in terms of the auxiliary functions ,",
    "@xmath21 the ov function  ( [ eq : takahashi - matsukidaira_ovf ] ) is expressed as @xmath22 a naive discretization of the auxiliary function  ( [ eq : aux1 ] ) , @xmath23 introduces the ov function for the discrete ov ( dov ) model , @xmath24 ,    \\end{split }    \\label{eq : dovf}\\ ] ] which is found to be ultradiscretizable .",
    "@xcite    let @xmath25 and @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the integral time and the discrete time - step , respectively . employing the effective distance as @xmath29 where @xmath30",

    "ultradiscretization  @xcite is a scheme for getting a piecewise - linear equation from a difference equation via the limit formula @xmath36 in order to go forward to the ultradiscretization of the ds2s  ov model  ( [ eq : ds2s  ov ] ) , it will be a good choice for us to begin with the ultradiscrete limit @xmath37 of the auxiliary function  ( [ eq : aux2 ] ) : @xmath38 in the same way to make the ov function for the dov model  ( [ eq : dovf ] ) from the auxiliary function  ( [ eq : aux2 ] ) , we obtain the ov function for the uov model  @xcite as @xmath39 where @xmath40 . the effective distance  ( [ eq : discrete_effective_distance ] ) , on the other hand , is ultradiscretized in the same manner : @xmath41 thus we obtain an ultradiscrete equation @xmath42 which is equivalent to @xmath43 as the ultradiscrete limit of the ds2s  ov model  ( [ eq : ds2s  ov ] ) .",
    "we name it the ultradiscrete s2s  ov ( us2s  ov ) model .",
    "when the monitoring period @xmath44 is fixed at zero , the us2s  ov model reduces to a special case of the uov model  @xcite . as we can see from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : uovf ] ) , ( [ eq : u_effective_distance ] ) and ( [ eq : us2s  ov ] ) , the velocity @xmath45 is determined by the optimal velocity for the minimum headway in the period between @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "thus cars will not restart nor accelerate , unless enough clearance goes on for a certain period of time . on the other hand ,",
    "cars immediately stop or slow down when their headways become too small to keep their velocities .",
    "the s2s effect and a `` cautious '' manner of driving are built into the uov model in this way .",
    "now let us see how a ca comes out from the us2s  ov model .",
    "let @xmath48 be the discretization step of the headway @xmath49 , or equivalently , the size of the unit cell of the ca .",
    "then with no loss of generality , we may set @xmath50 .",
    "assume that the number of vacant cells between the cars @xmath1 and @xmath7 , @xmath51 , must be non - negative , @xmath52 , which prohibits car - crash .",
    "then the us2s  ov model  ( [ eq : us2s  ov ] ) reduces to @xmath53 fixing @xmath54 at an integer , we call this model the s2s  ov cellular automaton ( ca ) . the s2s  ov ca reduces to the fi model  @xcite when @xmath55 and to the eca184  @xcite when @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the s2s model  @xcite also comes out from the s2s  ov ca by choosing @xmath57 and @xmath56 .",
    "thus the s2s  ov ca is regarded as a hybrid of the fi model and an extended s2s model .",
    "we shall numerically investigate the s2s  ov ca  ( [ eq : s2s  ovca ] ) . throughout this section ,",

    "this observation also suggests that the monitoring period is irrelevant to the number of metastable branches .",
    "all the end points of the branches as well as the jamming line are on the line @xmath76 .",
    "this is because the density at the end point is the maximum density @xmath77 that allows the velocity of the slowest car to be @xmath78 .",
    "the maximum density @xmath77 is determined by @xmath79 since all the cars flow at the velocity @xmath78 when @xmath80 , the corresponding flow is given by @xmath81 .",

    "any other metastable branch and the jamming line branch out from the free line . by observation ,",
    "the density of the branch point of the branch corresponding to the velocity @xmath78 reads @xmath83 this observation is explained as follows .",
    "suppose one car , say the car @xmath1 , runs at the velocity @xmath84 and the other @xmath85 cars run at the maximum velocity @xmath86 . at the moment the @xmath1-th car slows down to @xmath84 , the headway between the cars @xmath1 and @xmath7 is @xmath87 . since it takes at least @xmath69 time - steps for the car @xmath1 to speed up to @xmath86 , the headway between the cars @xmath1 and @xmath7 expands up to @xmath88 by the time the @xmath1-th car speeds up to @xmath86 .",
    "if all the cars can obtain the headway @xmath89 , slow cars running at the velocity @xmath84 disappear in the end .",
