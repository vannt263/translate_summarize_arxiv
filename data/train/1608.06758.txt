    "this non - gaussianity characteristic may not be well modeled even by a diffusion with compound - poisson jumps as well , since jumps may be then sparse compared with sampling frequency , so that increments are approximately gaussian except for intervals containing jump - time points .",
    "this calls for a more tailor - made estimation procedure when the driving is of pure - jump type , for which the approximate gaussianity in small - time is no longer effective .",
    "it seems that the literature is far from being well developed , motivating our present study .    in this paper",

    "this entails that the activity index @xmath24 determines the rate of convergence of estimating the trend parameter @xmath33 ; note that @xmath34 .",
    "most notably , unlike the case of diffusions ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , we can estimate not only the scale parameter @xmath35 but also the trend parameter @xmath33 , with the explicit asymptotic distribution in hand . to prove the asymptotic mixed normality",
    ", we will take a doubly approximate procedure based on the euler - maruyama scheme combined with the stable approximation of @xmath17 for @xmath16 .",
    "our result seems to provide us with the first systematic methodology for estimating the possibly non - linear pure - jump lvy driven sde based on a non - gaussian quasi - likelihood .",
    "let us make a couple of remarks on our statistical model .",
    "first , the model is semiparametric in the sense that we do not completely specify the of @xmath36 , while supposing the parametric coefficients ; of course , the is an infinite - dimensional parameter , so that @xmath24 alone never determines the distribution @xmath36 . in estimation of @xmath37 , it seems desirable ( whenever possible ) to estimate @xmath38 with leaving the remaining parameters contained in as much as unknown .",
    "the proposed quasi - likelihood , termed as ( non - gaussian ) stable quasi - likelihood , will provide us with a widely applicable tool for this purpose , extending the preceding results on diffusion processes , where @xmath5 is a standard .",
    "in particular , it gives an estimator having much better asymptotic behavior compared with the previously studied gaussian maximum quasi - likelihood estimator , which is known to be inconsistent when the target sampling time period is fixed ; see @xcite for details , and also section [ sec_backgrounds ] for brief background .",
    "second , note that we have assumed from the very beginning that @xmath39 , that is , @xmath5 contains no gaussian factor .",
    "normally , the simultaneous presence of a non - degenerate diffusion part and a non - null jump part makes the parametric - estimation problem much more complicated .",
    "the recent papers @xcite and @xcite discussed usefulness of pure - jump models . although they are especially concerned with financial context , pure - jump processes should be useful for model building in many other application fields where non - gaussianity of time - varying data is of primary importance ; for example , signal processing ( detection , estimation , etc . ) , population dynamics , hydrology , radiophysics , turbulence , biological molecule movement , noise - contaminated biosignals , and so on . see also @xcite and @xcite for recent related works .",
    "finally , our model may be formally seen as a continuous - time analogue to the discrete - time model @xmath40 where @xmath41 are i.i.d .",
    "random variables . by making use of the small - time non - gaussian stable structure of @xmath5 ,",
    "our model setup enables us to formulate a flexible and unified estimation paradigm , which can not be shared with the discrete - time counterpart . in this context , let us make some general remarks on the high - frequency - sampling asymptotics .    *",
    "the present bounded - domain asymptotics enables us to `` localize '' the event , sidestepping _ stability ( such as the ergodicity ) _ and _ moment - condition _ issues on @xmath42 , which is quite often inevitable for developing asymptotic theory for @xmath43 .",
    "instead , we need much more than the ( martingale ) central limit theorem with gaussian limit : a mixed normal limit theory for laq statistical experiments plays an essential role . fortunately , we have a very general tool , that is , jacod s characterization of conditionally gaussian martingales ( see @xcite and @xcite , and also section [ sec_localization ] ) , which in particular deal with the sde when @xmath5 is a pure - jump .",
    "* we have yet another benefit coming from the fine continuous - time model structure : as in the case of estimation of the diffusion coefficient of a diffusion type process ( cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) , we may treat much more general model setup , say a semimartingale regression model , with keeping the asymptotic mixed normality result for both location and scale coefficients .",
    "see section [ sec_model.extensions ] for more details .",
    "* nevertheless , it is well - known that observed information corresponding to some parameters is stochastically bounded unless @xmath43 , thereby theoretically preventing us from estimating it consistently ; see @xcite , and @xcite and the the references therein , and also section [ sec_backgrounds ] . at the same time",
    ", we should note that there is no general relation between actual - time and model - time scales ; virtually , one may always set the terminal sampling time @xmath44 to be a fixed value @xmath45 , so that @xmath46 may represent one day , one month , one year , etc .    as a matter of fact , our quasi - likelihood function does work even under the large - time asymptotics where @xmath43 .",
    "obviously , in that case the long - run characteristic of @xmath19 crucially affects the asymptotics . in section [ sec_ergodic ]",

    "the characteristic function of a random variable @xmath72 is denoted by @xmath73 . for any matrix @xmath74",
    "we let @xmath75 with @xmath76 denoting the transpose .",
    "we use @xmath77 for a generic positive constant which may vary at each appearance , and write @xmath78 when @xmath79 for every @xmath47 large enough . finally , the symbols @xmath80 and @xmath81 denote the convergences in @xmath54-probability and in distribution , respectively .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin in section [ sec_backgrounds ] with some background of our objective , and then describe our basic model setup in section [ sec_setup ] .",
    "the main results is presented in section [ sec_sql ] , followed by numerical experiments in section [ sec_simulations ] .",
    "section [ sec_proofs ] is devoted to the proof of the main results .",
    "for better clarifying the novelty of our result , let us first mention the gaussian quasi - likelihood estimation in case of the parametric ergodic diffusion model @xmath82 with true invariant distribution @xmath83 .",
    "the gaussian quasi - maximum likelihood estimator ( gqmle ) is defined to be any maximizer of the random function @xmath84 which comes from the `` fake '' small - time gaussian approximation of the transition probability : @xmath85 under appropriate conditions we have the asymptotic normality ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) : @xmath86\\bigg ) .",

    "also well known in the literature is that , even when @xmath88 we may estimate @xmath35 in an asymptotically efficient manner as @xmath89 by making use of the variant of : @xmath90 where the drift coefficient is now a non - estimable nuisance element ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",

    ", we will show that the notion of the _ `` local - gauss '' _ contrast function can be extended to the _ `` local - non - gaussian - stable '' _ counterpart , which brings in an essentially more efficient estimator in the present case , where @xmath88 and @xmath39 ; indeed , our asymptotic mixed normality result given in theorem [ sqmle.iv_bda_thm ] will formally extend both and .",
    "nevertheless , it should be mentioned that the gqmle can be used even for the pure - jump lvy driven case .",
    "indeed , it turned out in the previous work @xcite that adopting the gaussian quasi - maximum likelihood estimator based on the local - gauss approximation leads to the asymptotic normality of the form @xmath94 for some explicit @xmath95 . in view of our result in section [ sec_amn ] ,",
    "the gqmle may then entail much efficiency loss .",
    "turning to estimation strategy other than the gqmle , we give some remarks .",
    "our quasi - likelihood has its origin in the maximum - likelihood estimation of the @xmath96 , where @xmath5 is a standard @xmath24-stable @xmath5 associated with the characteristic function @xmath97 .",
    "then the @xmath58th increment is @xmath98 form i.i.d .",
    "array with common @xmath99 , and direct explicit computations should lead to the asymptotic normality and asymptotic efficiency of the rescaled maximum - likelihood estimator ; see @xcite and @xcite for details .",
    "note that we have the different features according to the value @xmath24 :    * for @xmath100 , the noise part @xmath101 is dominant compared with the drift part @xmath102 , hence @xmath35 can be estimated more quickly than @xmath33 ; * for @xmath103 , the opposite can be said ; * for the critical case @xmath104 ( the cauchy case ) , the drift and the noise parts are of the same stochastic order .",
    "concerning the possibly non - linear sde , our main result reveals an extended asymptotic phenomenon for @xmath18 .    for an explicit example , let us consider estimation of @xmath105 of a @xmath96 where @xmath5 is a normal - inverse gaussian , which is locally cauchy ( see @xcite ) .",
    "just for comparison with the gqmle , we set @xmath106 for some @xmath107 , so that @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 ; see @xcite ( also example [ j.ex_nig ] below ) for the details of nig es",
    ". then we have the following .    1 .",
    "the gqmle is asymptotically normal : @xmath111 where we may leave @xmath112 unknown while the value does affect the asymptotic covariance matrix .",
    "this can be deduced in a direct manner , following an analogous way to @xcite ; indeed , even for a general centered and standardized @xmath5 ( i.e. @xmath108 , @xmath109 ) , it readily follows from the fact @xmath113 for @xmath114 , and the lindeberg - feller theorem applied to the identity @xmath115 together with the delta method that @xmath116 2 .",

    "the qmle is asymptotically efficient ( cf . @xcite and @xcite ) .",
