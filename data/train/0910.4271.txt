    "experiments with radioactive beams are unraveling the properties of nuclei at the limits of stability  @xcite .",
    "studies of low - energy processes and transfer reactions require optical potentials  ( op ) suitable for dripline isotopes .",
    "this is also important for astrophysics applications , where capture and decay processes require a consistent determination of both scattering and bound states .",
    "dispersive optical models ( dom ) provide a useful tool that allows one to describe the mean field consistently over a broad energy range .",
    "the dom is grounded in the theory of many - body green s functions ( or propagators )  @xcite and in the proven equivalence between the many - body self - energy ( of propagator theory ) and the feshbach theory of the microscopic optical model  @xcite . in practice",
    "the dom can be thought as a parametrization of the self - energy .",
    "this has several advantages .",
    "it allows us to develop an op that describes consistently both elastic scattering and bound - state properties .",
    "the theory directly imposes important analytic relation between the real and imaginary components ( see below ) .",
    "also microscopic calculations  @xcite can be employed to determine the physical ingredients of the potentials .",
    "the dom was developed by mahaux and collaborators for a number of individual magic or near magic nuclei  @xcite .",
    "recently , the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite have performed a dom study for the chain of ca isotopes .",
    "this employed the world data on @xmath1ca , including _ both _ elastic scattering ( up to 200  mev ) and bound - state information from ( @xmath2,@xmath3 ) experiments .",
    "this analysis also discussed possible extrapolations toward the driplines and suggested new experiments to constrain the predictions for exotic nuclei  @xcite .",
    "a global parametrization of the coupled - channel dom was also reported in ref .",
    "@xcite for stable nuclei .",
    "the present talk discusses briefly the analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite and points to open issues that are being addressed to refine the predictions for unstable isotopes .",
    "ca , the data and curves are scaled down by an additional factor of 100.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=85.0% ] -.3 cm",
    "while the nucleon self - energy is an _ energy dependent _ and _ non - local _ potential , the vast majority of dom applications employ a local approximation of it .",
    "the same approach is followed here , although this approximation may be removed in future works .",
    "mahaux and sartor  @xcite start by separating the real part of the optical potential at the fermi surface ( @xmath4 ) and write the dom as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the local equivalent of the self - energy , @xmath7 , at the fermi energy ( @xmath8 ) is not an hartree - fock potential but it does describe the effects of the nuclear mean - field .",
    "we maintain this notation for consistency with the rest of the literature . ] .",
    "normally , this would be a static potential but it acquires an energy - dependence to account for the non - locality of @xmath9 .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the dynamic components of the dom are linked by the subtracted _ dispersion relation _",
    ", @xmath10 this relation is a direct consequence of the causality principle , which is therefore embedded in the model .",
    "thus , the dom is fully determined by parametrizing only the @xmath6 and @xmath11 components . the explicit form employed in this work",
    "is reported in detail in ref .",

    "these included elastic scattering data for @xmath19ca and @xmath20ca , with energies up to 200  mev , total reaction cross sections , experimental single - particle levels and spectroscopic factors and radii of proton bound states measured in ( @xmath2,@xmath3 ) reactions .",
    "the quality of the fit to the differential cross sections and analysing powers is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : ds ] and  [ fig : ay ]  ( left ) . for proton bound states ,",
    "only one data point could not be reproduced , i.e. , the @xmath12 orbit in @xmath14ca as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ds ]  ( right ) .",
    "an independent re - analysis of ( @xmath2,@xmath3 ) data has later corrected this value and resolved this discrepancy  @xcite .",
    "for such a large body of data ( 81 data sets comprising 3569 data points ) , the excellent agreement of the fit with just 25 free parameters provides confidence in the predictive power of the dom calculations .",
    "-.3 cm     figure  [ fig : ni ] shows a _",
    "preliminary _ comparison between the elastic proton scattering on stable ni sotopes and the prediction of the above dom , which was fitted to ca data only .",
    "the overall agreement is quite satisfying and shows the potentiality for global fits with this approach .",
    "however , proper extrapolations to unstable isotopes ( and in particular close to the driplines ) require particular care for the n / z asymmetry dependence of the surface part of the imaginary potential .",
    "this is usually assumed to behave as @xmath21 the choice for protons is @xmath22=+1 , which works quite well for @xmath23+@xmath1ca scattering . for neutrons ,",
    "the standard assumption in the literature ( @xmath24=-1 ) leads to inconsistencies for neutron - rich isotopes .",
    "similar difficulties have also been reported in a recent global op fit  @xcite .    unfortunately , the n+@xmath14ca scattering data solely available to ref .",
    "@xcite are not sufficient to constrain @xmath24 . choosing @xmath24=0",
    "was found to be consistent with spectroscopic factors from ( @xmath25,@xmath23 ) reactions but does not rule out other possibilities .",
    "new data for the n+@xmath15ca have recently been taken to verify this assumption  @xcite .",
    "it is expected that this will allow new fits that improve the description of dripline isotopes .",
