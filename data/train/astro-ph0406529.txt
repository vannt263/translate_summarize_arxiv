    "after many decades of study of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , recent progress has been made at defining the population of substellar objects @xcite .",
    "brown dwarfs ( bds ) are much more luminous and have hotter surfaces shortly after birth compared to their later cooler stages as l and t dwarfs . it has thus proved possible to count them in young pre - main sequence ( pms ) stellar clusters associated with nearby star formation region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a strong suggestion has emerged that the very young bd population is lower in lower density star formation regions ( like the taurus - auriga clouds ) and higher density regions ( like the orion nebula ) . such studies are important for understanding the efficiency of gravitational collapse at low masses , the uniformity of the imf under different cloud conditions , and the possible ejection of lower mass objects from multiple systems or circumstellar disks .",
    "x - ray astronomical surveys of young stellar clusters has proved to be an effective complement to optical and near - infrared ( o / nir ) surveys in defining pms stellar populations .",
    "x - ray emission is elevated @xmath13 above old disk levels in virtually all stars @xmath14 yrs and younger , providing an easy discriminant between pms cluster members and most galactic field stars @xcite .",
    "x - rays trace magnetic activity , primarily magnetic reconnection flaring , which is relatively insensitive to the presence or absence of circumstellar disks .",
    "x - ray samples are thus particularly effective in recovering young stars where the disks have dissipated , often classified as weak - lined or post t tauri stars .",
    "the relieves the bias towards disky and accreting pms stars that is often present in samples based on o / nir surveys .",
    "an additional feature is a well - established empirical correlation between x - ray and photospheric brightness that links the x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) with the @xmath15-band luminosity function ( klf ) .",
    "the astrophysical origin of this correlation is uncertain @xcite .    while previous generations of x - ray telescope",
    "had insufficient sensitivity and resolution to reveal the bulk of lower mass members of young stellar clusters , the @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 can penetrate deeply into the pms imf .",
    "intermediate - sensitivity @xmath0 studies had detected the majority of the stellar population and a modest fraction of the bd population in the @xmath16 ophiuchi , ic 348 , @xmath17 orionis and orion nebula young stellar clusters @xcite .",
    "x - ray studies thus join the active o / nir efforts to identify and characterize future bds that are contemporaneous with the pms protostellar and t tauri population .",
    "we report here an unusually deep observation of the northern core of the chamaeleon i star forming cloud obtained with @xmath0 .",
    "i was the site of the first x - ray discovered bd based on @xmath18 imagery @xcite and a considerable number of candidate bds have been reported using o / nir photometric and spectroscopic techniques @xcite .",
    "our @xmath0 observation is about 100 times more sensitive than the @xmath18 observations due to a combination of lower detector background , wider bandwidth and longer exposure time .",
    "if the x - ray emission extends to substellar masses without change in the typical @xmath19 ratio , then we expect to detect many of the young bds as well as the entire t tauri population .",
    "the cha i cloud is particularly well - suited to studies of young stellar populations .",
    "first , it is one of the nearest active star formation regions at @xmath20 pc .",
    "second , it is relatively isolated from other star forming clouds so there is little confusion due to older pms stars that have drifted into the field .",
    "third , the stellar population is relatively rich with a total population of @xmath21 members .",
    "the population associated with the north cloud core has two additional advantages : the molecular material is confined to a small region so many members are only lightly obscured ; and the stellar cluster is sufficiently compact that several dozen members can be studied in a single x - ray image .",
    "this molecular core , 296.5 - 15.7 , has 30 m@xmath12 of gas in a 0.4 pc ( 8) diameter region with peak column density @xmath22 @xmath23 @xcite .    the stellar population of the cha i north region has been surveyed at many spectral bands .",
    "the deepest of these surveys attain limits of @xmath24 , @xmath25 @xcite , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 @xcite , @xmath29 @xcite , @xmath30 mjy in the @xmath31  @xmath32 m , @xmath33 4  mjy in the @xmath34  @xmath32 m band @xcite , and @xmath35  mjy at 1.3  mm @xcite .",
    "it has also been examined for faint h@xmath36 emitting stars @xcite and for x - ray emitting stars down to @xmath37 erg s@xmath4 in the soft @xmath18 @xmath38 kev band @xcite .",
    "a @xmath39 region of the cha i north cloud was observed with the imaging array of the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis - i ) detector on board the @xmath0 x - ray observatory .",
    "the satellite and instrument are described by @xcite .",
    "the detector aimpoint was set at @xmath40 , epoch j2000 .",
    "figure [ cloud_abs.fig ] shows the field of view superposed on the molecular cloud ; it subtends a @xmath41 pc@xmath42 region at the cloud .",
    "the observation took place on 2.25@xmath433.04 july 2001 ut . with 1.3% of the exposure lost to ccd readout and 6 s lost to telemetry dropouts , the effective exposure was 66.3 ks .",
    "the initial stages of data reduction are described in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "briefly , we start with the level 1 events from the satellite telemetry , correct event energies for charge transfer inefficiency , and apply a variety of data selection operations such as asca event grades .",
    "several bright sources near the field center with clear stellar counterparts in the 2mass catalog ( sources 41 , 45 , 48 , 54 , 57 and 62 in table [ xsrcs.tab ] ) were used to align the field to the @xmath44 reference frame .",
    "an offset of 0.15 was applied to the initial @xmath0 field position ; the individual scatter of these alignment sources with respect to their 2mass positions is @xmath45 .",
    "candidate sources were located using a wavelet - based detection algorithm@xcite .",
    "we applied a low threshold ( @xmath46 ) so that some spurious sources are found which we exclude later .",
    "the image was visually examined for possible additional sources missed by the algorithm ; no missing sources or close double sources were found .",
    "events for each candidate source were extracted using the idl- and ciao - based script _",
    "acis_extract_. here , events are extracted in a small region around each source containing 95% of the enclosed energy derived from the point spread function of the telescope at that position .",
    "a local background is defined from a nearby source - free region of each source and is scaled to the source extraction area .",
    "unreliable weak candidate sources are now removed .",
    "these include : sources with @xmath47 net ( i.e. background - subtracted ) extracted counts ; faint sources with median energies above 5 kev that are probably fluctuations in the background ; faint sources with poorly concentrated events ; and faint sources with event arrival times indicating contamination by cosmic ray afterglows ( i.e. , several events appearing in a single pixel within 30 seconds ) . near the field center ( off - axis angle @xmath48 ) ,",
    "source positions are simple centroids of the extracted events , while positions for sources far off - axis are obtained from a convolution of the point spread function with the extracted event positions .",
    "the @xmath49 script also provides position - dependent telescope - plus - detector effective area @xmath50 energy curves ( @xmath51 files ) and spectral resolution matrices ( @xmath52 files ) for all sources .",
    "the resulting 107 @xmath0 sources and shown in figure [ acis_img.fig ] and their observed properties are given in table [ xsrcs.tab ] .",
    "it gives the running source number , source position , off - axis angle , background - subtracted extracted counts ( rounded to the nearest count ) , and cross - reference to the earlier @xmath18 sources designated chrx @xcite .",
    "only 17 of the brightest sources were found with @xmath18 satellite , with low spatial resolution but a wide spectral band similar to @xmath0 s , detected two sources in our acis field @xcite : 1axg j110943 - 7629 ( @xmath53 erg s@xmath4 ) which blends our sources # 38 , 39 , 40 , 42 and possibly 41 ; and 1axg j111011 - 7635 ( @xmath54 erg s@xmath4 ) which blends # 53 , 56 and 61 .",
    "these sources were earlier seen with the @xmath55 satellite with similar blending problems @xcite . ] .",
    "stellar counterparts are sought within 5 of the @xmath0 positions from five databases : the @xmath56 band 2mass all - sky catalog , the @xmath57 band denis catalog , our @xmath58 band ccd images of the region (  [ opt.sec ] ) , the simbad databases of published stars , and the list of cha i cloud members collected from the literature by @xcite .",
    "twenty - seven previously known cloud members in @xcite were recovered in the @xmath0 observation , nearly all with positional offsets @xmath59 as indicated in columns @xmath60 of table [ xsrcs.tab ] ) .",

    "@xmath62 are the background counts scaled to the extraction region .",
    "the distribution of photon energies were modelled as emission from a thermal plasma with energy @xmath63 based on the emissivities calculated by @xcite subject to interstellar absorption .",
    "the absorption is expressed in equivalent hydrogen column densities , @xmath64 ( @xmath23 ) , assuming solar metallicities in the intervening gas .",
    "( note , however , that the recent x - ray absorption study by vuong et al . 2003 suggests that dark clouds have metallicities @xmath65% lower than standard solar values . )",
    "our modelling is limited by statistical considerations ; weak sources ( typically @xmath66 cts ) are successfully modelled with 1-temperature plasmas , stronger sources ( @xmath67 cts ) usually require 2-temperature plasmas , while the strongest sources ( @xmath68 cts ) often require 2- or 3-temperatures with non - solar elemental abundances .",
    "these flux - dependent differences are unphysical because magnetically active pms stars , like the sun , undoubtedly have continuous distributions of plasma emission measures over a wide range of temperatures .",
    "the fitted temperatures represent only the dominant plasma components of the star during the observation .",
    "the presence of non - solar abundances , particularly involving elements like iron and neon with extreme first ionization potentials , has been confirmed in high - resolution x - ray grating studies of stars with strong flare levels ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "we thus caution that the spectral modeling does not reflect the full range of plasma properties and , for the fainter sources , may be nearly useless for interpreting plasma properties due to statistical uncertainties",
    ".    however , the broad - band luminosities integrated over the best - fit model are insensitive to spectral fitting uncertainties and have roughly @xmath69 errors @xcite .",
    "the spectral model is used here as a nonlinear spline curve through the data .",
    "x - ray luminosities , @xmath70 in the soft @xmath71 kev band and @xmath72 in the total @xmath5 kev band , are obtained from these fluxes by multiplying by @xmath73 where @xmath74 pc and 0.95 is the fraction of photons in the extraction region .",
    "these luminosities are from x - ray emission detected by the @xmath0 telescope and represent a lower limit to the emitted luminosities due to interstellar absorption . the absorption - corrected luminosities @xmath75 are based on the best - fit spectral model assuming @xmath76 .",
    "the accuracy of these values is often low due to uncertainties in the fitting on nonlinear spectral models to the observed spectra .",
    "the @xmath75 values should thus be used with caution .",
    "column 5 of table [ xprop.tab ] gives a variability indicator based on the arrival times of the extracted events .",
    "it is coded to probability of the kolmogorov - smirnov test @xmath77 that the source has no significant variation during the exposure : a = @xmath78 ( no evidence for variability ) ; b = @xmath79 ( possibly variable ) ; c = @xmath80 ( definitely variable ) . note that we expect several ` b ' values but no ` c ' values from a random collection of 107 constant sources .",
    "lightcurves of prominent flares are shown in figure [ flares.fig ] .",
    "the usno - b1.0 catalog @xcite provides @xmath81 photographic magnitudes and the 2mass catalog provides @xmath56 magnitudes for stellar counterparts across the acis field of view .",
    "there is also partial coverage of the field within the second release of the denis database at the @xmath82 bands . to augment these surveys , we obtained @xmath58 band ccd images of most of the acis field with the 1-m telescope and ccd detector at the south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) during 2002 february .",

    "counterpart ambiguities are thus restricted to multiple systems with component separations less than @xmath111 au .",
    "the remaining challenge is then to distinguish stellar from the dominant extragalactic source population .",
    "this is facilitated by two tools .",
    "first , unresolved extragalactic counterparts of @xmath0 sources in our flux range are typically active galactic nuclei with redshifts @xmath112 and faint magnitudes , @xmath113 @xcite .",

    "second , extragalactic sources rarely vary on intra - day timescales . of the 70 non - stellar sources in table [ xsrcs.tab ] , 66 are consistent with constancy , 3 are possibly variable ( consistent with a population of constant sources ) , and 1 is rapidly variable kev ) or a powerlaw ( photon index @xmath115 ) subject to @xmath116 @xmath23 absorption .",
    "this spectrum could emerge either from a star or an active galactic nucleus . ] .",
    "in contrast , 11 of the 37 stellar stellar sources are definitely variable and 6 are probably variable .",
    "most of the remaining stellar sources have fewer than 100 photons so only the most dramatic variations can be seen .",
    "together , the optical magnitude and the x - ray variability distributions indicate that little if any erroneous confusion between extragalactic and stellar sources is present .",
    "the more subtle distinction between stars associated with the cloud and background field stars stars is discussed in  [ new.sec ] and  [ sample.sec ] .",
    "we describe here the 10 acis sources coincident with o / nir stars which have not previously been considered to be candidate members of the cha i north star forming cloud .",
    "the relevant information are the photometric magnitudes and colors , our three siding spring observatory and magellan spectra (  [ opt.sec ] ) and the x - ray properties . the magnitudes and colors alone",
    "prove to be a major constraint .",
    "most of these stars are too faint to be pms stars , or even zams stars , at the distance of the cloud and do not have the very red colors associated with a low - luminosity young bd .",
    "they also lie in the outer regions of the acis field away from the core of the young stellar cluster .",
    "we conclude that they are mostly more distant stars unrelated to the cloud . in only one case where a strong emission line is present ( # 16 )",
    "is it feasible that the @xmath0-discovered star may be a cloud member .",
    "qualitatively , it is not surprising that @xmath0 detects distant high - magnetic activity members of the galactic field main sequence g , k and early - m population .",
    "studies of solar neighborhood stars show that @xmath117% of k and early - m disk stars , and @xmath118% of g disk stars , have x - ray luminosities around @xmath119 erg s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "such stars could be seen out to distances around @xmath71 kpc in our acis exposure .",

    ", we find a gratifying agreement between our x - ray and luhman s spectroscopic census of cloud members considering that the selections are based on very different criteria .",

    "we see that both klfs show a similar rise from bright magnitudes to a peak around @xmath270 .",
    "the fall off at faint magnitudes appears somewhat steeper in cha i north , but the difference is not statistically significant .",
    "figure [ lf.fig]b shows the cha i north imf for our sample using masses given in table [ oprop.tab ] , and compares it to both the imf inferred for the onc @xcite and a general galactic imf derived by @xcite from a variety of cluster and field star populations . here , a deficiency of lower mass stars in cha i north is clearly present .",

    "i north imfs indicate only a 0.3% probability ( 3@xmath17 equivalent ) they are drawn from the same population . alternatively ,",
    "if one considers the ratio of stars in the ( 0.1 - 0.3):(0.3 - 1.0 ) m@xmath12 bins , the observed ratio in cha i north of 5:14 has a 99% confidence ratio @xmath272 while the orion and kroupa imfs predict a ratio around 1.5 .",
    "the difference can be erased only if a considerable number of cha i north stars are present that simultaneously have @xmath15 below our completeness limit @xmath235 and masses above @xmath9 m@xmath12 ; i.e. , an older pms population superposed on the younger well - characterized population .    we thus establish a deficit of @xmath11 m@xmath12 stars in cha i north compared to standard imfs we can tentatively and qualitatively extend this inference to the bd regime .",
    "three previously known objects at or below the stellar limit are detected : iso 192 , iso 217 and hn 13 . but no additional x - ray selected population ( with the possible exception of the rapidly variable source # 42 with no reported o / nir counterpart ) is seen .",
    "if a large number of bds were present , we would expect a fraction of them to have x - ray luminosities above our sensitivity and appear in the acis image .",
    "this result is consistent with reports of poor bd populations in the taurus - auriga and ic 348 star forming regions @xcite .",
    "however , this argument can not be made quantitatively until the coup survey establishes the scatter about the @xmath273 and @xmath274 relationships in substellar pms objects .",
    "it may be that the cha i north cloud has an intrinsically non - standard imf due to its star formation process .",
    "for example , the population of lowest mass stars may be sensitive to the spectrum of the turbulent velocity field in the cloud @xcite .",
    "but , it is critical to recall that the deficiency of lower mass stars applies only to the @xmath275 ( @xmath6 pc ) acis field .",
    "we thus can not exclude alternative hypotheses that place the lower mass stars preferentially outside the acis field of view .",
    "it seems plausible that mass segregation is present leading to a surfeit of higher mass stars in the cloud core .",
    "this could either be a characteristic of the primordial cluster formation process or a later dynamical development .",
    "evidence for primordial mass segregation has been found both in the rich orion nebula cluster @xcite and in the sparse @xmath276 cha cluster @xcite .",
    "dynamical segregation could also occur if lower mass stars are preferentially born with a velocity dispersion greater than the higher mass stars , or if they are ejected from multiple systems due to close gravitational encounters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a velocity dispersion difference as small as @xmath277 km s@xmath4 is sufficient for stars to travel outside the acis field in @xmath30 myr , a typical age of the cha i north stars .",
    "the low - mass population of the chamaeleon i cloud has been investigated in the o / nir bands by several groups but with discrepant samples and differing conclusions @xcite . some are optimistic that a significant population of low mass stars and substellar objects are being found within the heavily contaminated infrared samples , while others suggest bds are deficient or that the census is too incomplete to reach clear conclusions .",
    "we bring to bear here a distinct and complementary method for identifying pms stars of all masses : high sensitivity , high resolution imagery with the @xmath0 x - ray observatory .",
    "our @xmath0 survey with limiting @xmath3 erg s@xmath4 , sufficient to detect the contemporary active sun , should be complete to @xmath268 or @xmath245 m@xmath12 . equally importantly",
    ", x - ray surveys of this type can confidently tell when an o / nir star is @xmath278 a cloud member because of the enormous difference in @xmath19 ratios for pms and old disk stars which frequently contaminate o / nir surveys .",
    "we find no cloud members with @xmath279 erg s@xmath4 ( @xmath5 kev band ) , and no more than one new x - ray discovered cloud member is present .",
    "we furthermore confirm that several previously suspected cloud members are probably background stars .",
    "the result is a nearly complete and uncontaminated sample of 27 cloud members in the acis field of the cha i north cloud .",
    "the imf of this sample is significantly deficient in @xmath11 m@xmath12 stars compared to the imf of the rich orion nebula cluster and of the general stellar imf .",
    "this supports recent observational studies that report deficits in the bd population in low density star formation regions @xcite",
    ". however , our x - ray field of view is rather small , so we can not discriminate between a true deficiency in low mass stars and alternative explanations such as mass segregation or dynamical ejection of the lowest mass pms stars x - ray study of the cha i south region .",
    "their image is larger but several times less sensitive than our @xmath0 acis image .",
    "they detect two bona fide brown dwarfs and several h@xmath36 emitting objects near the hydrogen burning mass limit .",
    "it is possible that cha i south does not share the same imf as the inner region of cha i north we study here . ] .    from the forthcoming coup study ,",
    "we are likely to learn how the relationships between @xmath72 and @xmath152 , @xmath15 and @xmath240 extend into the substellar regime .",
    "this will permit us to derive quantitative inferences regarding the bd population in cha i north . at the present time",
    ", we can say only qualitatively that this population appears to be small as we would expect some fraction to have x - ray luminosities exceeding @xmath3 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "three of the 27 stars in our complete sample  iso 192 , iso 217 and ( probably ) hn 13  lie below the substellar limit and , by virtue of their x - ray emission , are confirmed cloud members .",
    "the reliability of the x - ray census method used here rests on the empirical relationships between @xmath72 and @xmath15 and the closely related correlations between @xmath72 , @xmath152 and masses @xmath240 among pms stars .",
    "these relationships have been seen in nearly all well - studied pms stellar clusters with @xmath0 : the onc @xcite , ngc 1333 @xcite , ic 348 @xcite , mon r2 @xcite and ngc 2024 @xcite . given their importance ,",
    "it is worrisome that these relationships between magnetic activity and bulk stellar properties are largely unexplained @xcite .",
    "but if one accepts them , these relationships permit a translation between an observational x - ray flux limit and limits in the klf and imf .",
    "our confidence in the reliability and completeness of x - ray surveys will increase as we improve our characterization of these relationships and scatter about them .",
    "finally , we bring to attention one remarkable low mass pms star .",
    "iso 192 was already known to have the heaviest absorption and strongest nir color excess among cha i members with heavy spectroscopic veiling and large photometric variability .",
    "it has been interpreted as a substellar ( @xmath280 m@xmath109 ) class i protostar and the likely source of the cha i north molecular bipolar flow .",
