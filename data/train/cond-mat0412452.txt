    "in order to implement solid - state quantum information processing devices , the noise sources causing decoherence of their quantum states have to be carefully understood , controlled , and eliminated .",
    "this is a formidable task , as a solid - state environment generically couples a macroscopic number of degrees of freedom to any such device .",
    "thus , a fundamental prerequisite for any design is that it must significantly decouple the quantum states used for computation from phonons and other quasiparticles in the underlying solid crystal .",
    "examples of such designs are those employing discrete states in quantum dots @xcite or superconductors with a gapped density of states @xcite .",
    "most research going beyond this fundamental prerequisite has concentrated on decoupling devices from external noise sources such as electromagnetic noise generated by control and measurement apparatus @xcite . on the other hand , there inevitably are internal noise sources because the fabrication of gates , tunnel junctions , and other functional components creates defects in the underlying crystal . prominent examples of such defects are background charges in charge - based devices or cricital current fluctuations in flux - based devices @xcite . a clear signature of such defects is telegraph noise in the case of a few defects or @xmath0-noise in the case of a larger ensemble @xcite . with the growing success in engineering the electromagnetic environment , these defects are becoming more and more the key limiting sources of decoherence .",
    "such defects do not fall in the large class of noise sources that can be approximated well as a bosonic bath , and this fact complicates analysis . whereas it is realistic to treat a bosonic bath in the tractable near - equilibrium thermodynamic limit where fluctuations are purely gaussian @xcite , localized noise sources with bounded spectra like the defects in which we are interested produce noise that is significantly non - gaussian .",
    "theories treating large ensembles of non - gaussian noise sources have been presented @xcite . however , with the ongoing improvement in nanofabrication technology , it is realistic to consider the case where non - gaussian noise sources are reduced down to only a single one or a few per device .",
    "this is the case we treat here , and thus the defects find a more realistic representation as a small set of bistable fluctuators @xcite ( henceforth abbreviated bfls ) . in principle , this approach can be extended to larger sets of bfls with a range of different mean switching times ( _ e.g. _ , an ensemble with an exponential distribution of switching times that produces @xmath0-noise ) .",
    "this report is organized as follows .",
    "section ii presents the model of a single bfl in the semiclassical limit , where it acts as a source of telegraph noise .",
    "section iii introduces an idealized open loop quantum control technique , quantum bang - bang control , which is suitable for slowly fluctuating noise sources .",
    "section iv explains how we simulated the qubit dynamics under the influence of noise with and without bang - bang control by integrating of the corresponding time - dependent schrdinger equation . as a measure of the decoherence",
    ", we analyze the deviations of the qubit s trajectory on the bloch sphere from that of the noiseless case .",
    "these deviations take the form of a random walk around the noiseless - case trajectory .",
    "we therefore analyze the suppression of these deviations by comparing the variances of these random walks with and without bang - bang control .",
    "both numerical and analytical solutions ( the latter in the long - time or `` diffusion '' limit ) are presented .",
    "comparison of the numerical simulations to the analytical solutions shows excellent agreement .",
    "we then analyze how these results change when practical limitations are considered such as the fact that a bang - bang pulse can not be an ideal @xmath1-function impulse and the fact that the duration or polarization axis of the pulse may suffer from random fluctuations .",
    "we show at the end of section iv.b that within large margins bang - bang suppression of the bfl noise is not inhibited by having a finite , rather than infinitesimal , pulse length .",
    "however , in section v , we do find that duration and polarization axis errors in the bang - bang pulses can significantly affect the suppression of bfl noise .",
    "we present a point of optimum performance .",
    "section vi concludes with remarks on several recent publications concerning the suppression of telegraph or @xmath0-noise .",
    "we describe the bfl - noise influenced evolution of the qubit in its semiclassical limit by using a stochastic schrdinger equation @xcite with the time - dependent effective hamiltonian @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 define the free ( noiseless ) qubit dynamics .",
    "@xmath5 denotes a function randomly switching between @xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "[ bflnoisesignal ] ) , which represents a telegraph noise signal .",
    "the switching events follow a symmetrical poisson process , _ i.e. _ , the probabilities of the bfl switching from @xmath7 to @xmath8 or @xmath8 to @xmath7 are the same and equal in time .",
    "the poisson process is characterized by the mean time separation @xmath9 between two bfl flips .",
    "the coupling amplitude to the qubit in frequency units is @xmath10 .",
    "the relation of this hamiltonian to a microscopic model is explained in the appendix . +   +    schematic plot of a typical poisonian bfl noise signal and its resulting random walk behavior ( in the limit of small deviations ) .",
    "the periodic fast switching step function represents a bang - bang pulse with a time scale ratio : @xmath11 and yields a quite smaller random walk step - length .",
    "@xmath12 denotes the evolution period of the qubit in the noiseless case . ]",
    "starting with an arbitrary initial state of the qubit , represented by some given point on the bloch sphere , we can numerically integrate the corresponding stochastic differential equation and obtain the corresponding random walk on the bloch sphere @xmath13 with @xmath14 denoting the usual time - ordering operator .",
    "schematic plot of noisy qubit evolution generated by poissonian telegraph noise .",
    "the resulting random walk ( dot - dashed line ) on the bloch sphere is comprised both of deviations @xmath15 in parallel to the free precession trajectory ( dotted line ) , which correspond to dephasing , and deviations @xmath16 perpendicular to it , which correspond to relaxation / excitation . ]",
    "we propose to reduce the influence of the bfl - noise by applying to the qubit a continuous train of @xmath17-pulses along the @xmath18-axis .",
    "this refocusing pulse scheme essentially corresponds to the standard quantum bang - bang procedure or the carr - purcell - gill - meiboom echo technique from nmr @xcite . for technical convenience , we consider the @xmath17-pulses to be of infinitesimal duration .",
    "this simplification is not crucial as will be detailed later in section iv.b .",
    "the pulses are assumed to be separated by a constant time interval @xmath19 .",
    "the mean separation @xmath9 between two bfl flips is assumed to be much longer than @xmath19 . for theoretical convenience",
    ", we also assume that @xmath9 is shorter than the free precession period of the qubit .",
    "this too is not a crucial restriction .",
    "( it can always be overcome by changing to a co - precessing frame . )",
    "qualitatively , bang - bang control works as follows . since @xmath20 , it is usually the case that the bfl does not flip during the time between two bang - bang pulses that flip the qubit . in this way , the bang - bang pulses average out the influence of @xmath21 .",
    "in fact , the refocusing scheme fully suppresses the @xmath22-term of the static hamiltonian ( [ statham ] ( compare fig .",
    "[ bb1rwstep ] ) ; but this turns out to be no crucial obstacle to universal quantum computation as will be outlined later on . as one can visualize in fig .",
    "[ bflnoisesignal ] , it is only when a bfl flip occurs during a bang - bang period that the net influence of the bfl felt by the qubit is nonzero , and the qubit thus suffers some random deviation from its trajectory in the noiseless case .",
    "taken together , these random deviations constitute a random walk around the noiseless case trajectory .",
    "while this walk is actually continuous , it can be modelled as a discrete walk with steps that are randomly distributed in time , one step for each bfl flip ( see _ e.g. _",
    "the average step length is essentially the product of the noise coupling strength @xmath10 and the mean time the bfl in its present state can influence the qubit . without bang - bang control , this mean influence time is @xmath9 , whereas with bang - bang control , it is reduced to @xmath19 . therefore , both with and without bang - bang control , the random walk has the same time distribution of steps , but with bang - bang control the step size can be significantly reduced roughly by a factor of the ratio of time scales @xmath23 .",
    "now we study this proposal quantitatively .",
    "we simulate these random walks both with and without bang - bang control by integrating both numerically and analytically the schrdinger equation , equ .",
    "( 4 ) , with the stochastic hamiltonian of equs .  ( 1 - 3 ) . as generic conditions for the qubit dynamics ,",

    ", we set the qubit s initial state to be spin - up along the @xmath25-axis . if the qubit - bfl coupling @xmath10 were zero , then the qubit would simply precess freely on the bloch sphere around the rotation axis @xmath26 ( the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ blochsphere ] ) .",
    "hence , we expect for a sufficiently small coupling ( @xmath27 ) only a slight deviation of the individual time evolution compared to the free evolution case ( the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ blochsphere ] ) . for the coupling strength , we take @xmath28 . all the following times and energies",

    "the time scale ratio is taken to be @xmath32 if not denoted otherwise .",
    "this approach accounts for the essential features of our specific situation : the long correlation time of the external noise , essentially @xmath9 , its non - gaussian statistics and its potentially large amplitude at low frequencies .",

    "a detailed numerical analysis shows that _ without _ bang - bang suppression , the deviations parallel to the free precession trajectory ( which correspond to dephasing ) are of similar size to those perpendicular to free precession ( which correspond to relaxation / excitation ) .",
    "in contrast , with bang - bang control , dephasing is almost totally absent as one can see in the inset of fig .",
    "[ devevolution ] .    the main double - logarithmic plot of fig .",

    "it is not until times on the order of @xmath29 that the noise - induced deviations start to behave as typical classical random walks , increasing as a square - root in time .",
    "we now develop analytical random walk models for our system .",
    "the random walk on the bloch sphere is in general two - dimensional , consisting of both parallel and perpendicular deviations to the free evolution trajectory .",

    "we first calculate for both cases the probability distributions of the deviations after one bfl flip ( `` one - step deviations '' in terms of the discrete random walk ) .",

    "this is no crucial drawback but merely lies in the nature of our generic situation .",
    "if needed , both components can be isolated .",
    "the derivation of the maximal one - step deviation for the bang - bang controlled situation has to be handled differently .",
    "the deviation resulting from a bfl flip during a bang - bang pulse period is maximal if the step happens exactly at the moment of the second qubit spin - flip ( _ i.e. _ , in the middle of the bang - bang cycle ) .",
    "when this happens , the refocusing evolution has in its first half a drift , for example , to the `` right '' ( compare to fig .",
    "[ bb1rwstep ] ) and in the last half an equal aberration",

    "the dephasing part of deviation evidently averages out , while a relaxating aberrance arise proportional to the noise - coupling constant @xmath10 . ]",
    "the resulting one - step deviation appears to be on the order of @xmath58 .",
    "however , this is scaled down by a factor of @xmath53 , as the impact of the aberration in @xmath59-direction is proportional to a factor of @xmath60 , where @xmath61 denotes the longitudinal angle of the present spin position on the bloch sphere ( see fig .",
    "[ bb1rwstep ] ) .",
    "this is because the @xmath22-component of the noisy evolution does not influence the qubit , if it is near the @xmath62-state and its influence is suppressed correspondingly in between .",
    "as we are mainly interested in mean aberrations after many random walk steps , we simply average the maximal one - step deviation over one precession period in the usual rms manner to obtain @xmath63 obviously , this variance only contributes to relaxation .    in the long time limit , we replace the fluctuating number of random walk steps for a given time @xmath64 of noisy evolution by its expectation value @xmath65 .",

    "in particular , we confirmed our preliminary qualitative picture that bang - bang control works as a high pass filter , suppressing qubit errors by a factor @xmath145 that is directly proportional to the ratio of the mean bfl switching time and the period between bang - bang pulses .",

    "we shall now connect the model of a _ single _ bfl as a telegraph noise source to a microscopic hamiltonian .",

    "their third approach , which is both the most general and the most complicated , is to deduce a master equation by applying a non - markovian weak - coupling perturbation ansatz in second order in @xmath10 .    for our investigations , we prefer this last and most general approach : a stochastic treatment employing an appropriate randomly changing bfl - noise hamiltonian term ( compare also to @xcite ) .",
    "this choice is not only because of practical reasons ( to make our numerics feasible ) , but also due to empirical considerations ( see @xcite , where characteristics of telegraph noise were observed and attributed to bfls ) . hence , we restrict our analysis to the limit @xmath152 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the limit where the coupling of the bfl to the external environment is much larger than interaction between the bfl and the qubit . for convenience , we assume the bfl is in its high - temperature limit .",
    "( note that this does not necessarily mean the qubit is also in a high - temperature regime for the qubit s energy scale might be much larger than that of the bfl . )",
    "we thus assume the bfl behaves like a classical ( _ i.e. _ , decohered ) noise source , and we specifically describe the bfl s influence on the qubit with the following stochastic hamiltonian : @xmath153 in the equation above , @xmath5 is a random function of time representing the switching of the @xmath154-value between @xmath155 . in our high - temperature limit ,",
    "we assume @xmath5 has symmetrical poissonian statistics ( _ i.e. _ , the probabilities of the bfl switching from @xmath7 to @xmath8 and from @xmath8 to @xmath7 are equal and constant over time ) .",
    "such a symmetrical random process is readily described by just one parameter : the typical time separation @xmath9 between two bfl flips ( see fig .",
    "[ bflnoisesignal ] ) .",
    "the high temperature limit is not a crucial constraint .",
    "treating the strongly thermally coupled bfl in an intermediate temperature regime would only result in some asymmetrically switching @xmath5 .",
    "the typical switching times time @xmath156 for switching the bfl up and down respectively satisfy the detailed balance relation @xmath157 , where @xmath158 denotes the energy separation of the two bfl - states , and @xmath159 the temperature of the heat bath which drives the switching of the bfl .",
    "the microscopic structure of the rates depends on details of the experiment .",
    "typically , they will be golden rule rates containing the density of states of the heat bath and the matrix element of its coupling to the bfl .",
    "if that bath is made of harmonic oscillators with an ohmic spectral density , we e.g.  expect switching rater @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is the dimensionless coupling strength to the ohmic bath .",

    "in fact , assuming the the bang - bang pulse cycles are sufficiently short relative both the typical @xmath7 to @xmath8 and @xmath8 to @xmath7 switching times of the bfl , bang - bang suppression of the bfl noise should not be diminished at all by the bfl s asymmetrical switching .",
