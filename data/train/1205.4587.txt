    "the processes @xmath22 with @xmath23 are of great interest for our understanding of qcd and of the  meson structure . the corresponding amplitude @xmath24 contains only one invariant form factor , @xmath25 which is one of the simplest hadronic form factors in qcd .",
    "we shall address the general situation when both photons are virtual : @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 from the experimental perspective , the most interesting kinematical configuration is when one of the photons is almost real and the  other has virtuality @xmath29 for this special case , we use the notation @xmath30 the form factor @xmath31 has been the subject of detailed experimental @xcite and theoretical investigations ( for recent references , see @xcite ) .",
    "a qcd factorization theorem predicts the behaviour of the form factor at asymptotically large momentum  transfers  @xcite : @xmath32 which gives for @xmath33 @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( w.l.o.g , we denote the larger virtuality by @xmath36 ) : @xmath37 in the pion case , setting @xmath38 and @xmath39 this result reduces to the asymptotic behaviour @xmath40 @xcite , with @xmath41 similar relations follow for the mesons @xmath42 and @xmath43 after taking particle mixing into account  @xcite .    within errors ,",
    "this saturation property is indeed found for the @xmath42 and @xmath43 form factors .",
    "however , large-@xmath44 data up to @xmath45 from babar @xcite indicate that @xmath46 does not saturate at large @xmath44 but increases further . no compelling theoretical explanation of the qualitatively different behaviour of the @xmath47 form factor compared to the @xmath48 and @xmath49 form factors has been proposed . as concluded in @xcite , the behaviour of the @xmath47 form factor is hard to explain in qcd",
    ". moreover , the babar findings for @xmath50 require @xmath51 duality - violating corrections between the hadron and the  qcd  spectral  densities  @xcite . very recently ,",
    "belle @xcite presented their results on the @xmath50 form factor which are in fact compatible with qcd factorization .",
    "another , particularly interesting process is the transition @xmath52 here , one expects that , for the case of massive quarks , the onset of the factorization regime is , compared to the case of massless quarks , delayed to higher @xmath29 the details of the form - factor behaviour provide valuable information on the interplay of perturbative and nonperturbative qcd at intermediate and large momentum transfers .    in recent publications @xcite",
    ", we analyzed the @xmath53 form factors for light mesons , making use of qcd sum rules in their local - duality ( ld ) limit @xcite .",
    "we have given arguments that the ld sum rules provide already for @xmath44 larger  than  a  few gev@xmath54 reliable predictions for the @xmath55 form factors of light pseudoscalars with an accuracy increasing very fast with  @xmath29    the goal of this analysis is two - fold : first , we discuss the subtleties of the formulation of a ld model for transition form factors for the case of massive quarks .",
    "second , we apply our ld model to the case of the @xmath0 form factor .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec:2pf ] briefly recalls results for the various 2-point functions that may be used for the extraction of decay constants of heavy @xmath21 pseudoscalars . in section  [ sec : tfa ] , we present the dispersion representations for @xmath2 and @xmath8 3-point functions and discuss the procedure of obtaining the @xmath56 form factor from these correlators .",
    "we also give our predictions for @xmath31 in a broad range of @xmath29 section [ sec : sac ] summarizes our conclusions .",
    "for the case of massive quarks , one may consider , on an equal footing , the @xmath57 @xmath58 and @xmath59 correlators ,  where @xmath60 and @xmath61 denote the axial - vector and pseudoscalar currents , respectively .",
    "the @xmath62 correlator involves two independent lorentz structures ; to leading order in the strong coupling @xmath63 it  reads @xmath64 we consider the sum rule for the longitudinal part @xmath65 of the correlator @xmath57 which contains the contribution of the pseudoscalar mesons on its hadronic side .",
    "the dispersion representations for the other correlators are also  well - known @xcite .",
    "after application of the borel transformation , one finds @xmath66 + \\mbox{power corrections } , \\\\ & \\langle ap\\rangle{:}\\qquad f_p^2m^2e^{-m^2\\tau}+\\mbox{excited states}=\\frac{n_cm^2}{2\\pi^2}\\int\\limits_{4m^2}^\\infty{\\rm d}s\\,e^{-s\\tau}\\sqrt{1-\\frac{4m^2}{s}}\\left[1+o(\\alpha_s)\\right ] + \\mbox{power corrections } , \\\\ &",
    "\\langle pp\\rangle{:}\\qquad f_p^2m^4e^{-m^2\\tau}+\\mbox{excited states}=\\frac{n_cm^2}{2\\pi^2}\\int\\limits_{4m^2}^\\infty{\\rm d}s\\,s\\,e^{-s\\tau}\\sqrt{1-\\frac{4m^2}{s}}\\left[1+o(\\alpha_s)\\right ] + \\mbox{power corrections}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the sum rules for @xmath67 and @xmath59 may be obtained from the @xmath62 sum rule by taking the first and second @xmath68-derivatives , respectively .",
    "thus , considering any of these correlators leads to equivalent results for the case of massive quarks , once proper subtractions are performed .    implementing quark ",
    "hadron duality in the usual way , _",
    "i.e. _ , as a low - energy cut on the perturbative contribution to the correlator , and setting @xmath69 ( ld limit )  in which case all nonperturbative power corrections vanish  ,  the  resulting expressions for the decay constants take the form @xmath70 obviously , the effective thresholds @xmath71 @xmath72 and @xmath73 must be ( slightly ) different from each other",
    ".    it will be useful to recall that in the chiral limit , @xmath74 the situation is qualitatively different from the massive - quark case : in the chiral limit , the @xmath62 correlator is transverse and contains only one lorentz structure , @xmath75 the corresponding invariant amplitude contains the contribution of the goldstone whereas excited pseudoscalars decouple from the axial current in the chiral limit @xcite .",
    "unlike the case of massless quarks , massive ground - state  pseudoscalars do not contribute to the transverse lorentz structure of the @xmath62 correlator of the axial currents of massive quarks  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath77 form factor may be extracted from two different correlators : namely , from @xmath2 and from @xmath78      let us start with the amplitude for two - photon production from the vacuum @xmath79 induced by the pseudoscalar  current @xmath80 with @xmath81 denoting the photon polarization vectors : @xmath82 the amplitude @xmath83 is obtained from the vacuum expectation value of the @xmath84-product of one pseudoscalar and two  vector currents and will be called the @xmath2 amplitude . the decomposition of the amplitude contains only one invariant  form factor @xmath85 : @xmath86 to one - loop accuracy , this form factor satisfies the spectral representation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath87 where @xmath88 the two - loop radiative corrections to @xmath89 have been calculated for massive quarks and one virtual and one real photon and have been found to vanish @xcite .",
    "we now perform the usual steps of the method of qcd sum rules @xcite : calculate @xmath90 by inserting hadronic intermediate states , perform the borel transform ( @xmath91 ) , implement duality as a low - energy cut on the corresponding borelized spectral representation @xcite , and go to the ld limit by setting @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "this brings us to the representation for the @xmath92 form factor @xmath93 in order to obtain the form factor , we have to fix @xmath94 finding reliable criteria for fixing effective thresholds is a rather subtle and difficult problem that has been investigated in great detail in @xcite .    in general",
    ", the effective threshold depends on all external kinematical variables , in our case @xmath95 and @xmath96 we consider both momenta as space - like and different from each other , @xmath97 and @xmath98 therefore , we have @xmath99 at large @xmath44 and fixed @xmath100 the effective threshold can be determined by matching the ld expression ( [ ld_pvv ] ) to the factorization theorem for the form factor ( [ factorization2 ] ) .",
    "the way how to proceed at smaller @xmath44 will be discussed in sec .  [ 3.3 ] .    for any finite effective threshold @xmath101",
    "the form factor behaves like @xmath102 as demanded by pqcd .",
    "however , the spectral density of the 3-point function @xmath89 does not reduce to the product @xmath103 with a @xmath100-independent function @xmath104 this means that , in order to reproduce correctly the pqcd asymptotics , the effective threshold should depend  on @xmath105 the result of a numerical computation of the exact effective threshold that provides the correct matching of the ld form factor at @xmath106 to the asymptotic pqcd form factor ( [ factorization2 ] ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ plot:1 ] . in practice , the @xmath100-dependence  of the threshold is not very strong .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we stress once more that we can not guarantee the applicability of the ld model at @xmath107@xmath108 nevertheless , let us compare our ld predictions for small @xmath44 with experiment . using @xmath109 @xcite ,",
    "one obtains @xmath110 the ld model using the @xmath8 correlator yields @xmath111  the ld form factor from the @xmath2 correlator has @xmath112 the latter value agrees very well with experiment , so optimistically one may expect the ld model for @xmath2 to provide reliable predictions for the form factor for all  @xmath29 figure [ plot:2](b ) compares these @xmath2 results with the available experimental data from babar @xcite .",
    "we analyzed qcd sum rules for the @xmath113 transition form factor @xmath114 utilizing two different 3-point functions , @xmath8 and @xmath115 in the ld limit .",
    "we also revisited the decay constants @xmath16 of massive @xmath116 pseudoscalar ground states from ld sum rules for the 2-point functions @xmath57 @xmath117 and @xmath118 since @xmath16 determines the asymptotics of the form factor @xmath56 within the framework of pqcd factorization theorems .",
    "our results are the following :    1 .   in the ld limit",
    ", the sum rules for the 2-point functions @xmath57 @xmath67 and @xmath59 require different effective  thresholds for the ground - state pseudoscalar meson .",
    "the sum rules and their thresholds coincide only in the nonrelativistic limit , _",
    "i.e. _ , for infinitely heavy quarkonia of finite radius .",
    "analyzing the form factors @xmath56 obtained from ld qcd sum rules for the @xmath2 and @xmath8 3-point functions , we have determined the corresponding exact effective thresholds at large momentum transfer @xmath9 and a fixed ratio @xmath119 by matching the ld form factors to their pqcd asymptotic behaviour for large  @xmath29 these exact thresholds corresponding to @xmath106 do depend on the ratio @xmath105 this perfectly confirms our previous findings that the effective thresholds in qcd sum rules depend , in general , on the external kinematical variables of the problem under consideration @xcite . 1 .   the chiral limit forms the sole exception : there the exact effective threshold for the @xmath8 correlator  does not depend on @xmath100 and is equal to @xmath120 moreover , this effective threshold coincides with the effective threshold of the transverse part of @xmath121 2 .   for massive quarks , the @xmath100-dependent effective thresholds for the 3-point functions @xmath122 and @xmath8 turn out to differ from each other and from the thresholds of the 2-point functions .",
    "our results for the thresholds for these two 3-point functions are given in fig .",
    "[ plot:1 ] .",
    "the _ ld model _ for the form factor emerges if one _ assumes _ that the effective threshold @xmath123 at finite  @xmath44  does not differ sizeably from its asymptotic behaviour @xmath124 for light pseudoscalar mesons , this conjecture is found to be justified for @xmath44 larger than a few @xmath125 according to the results from quantum - mechanical potential models and to the experimental data on the @xmath126 @xmath127 and @xmath49 form factors .",
    "+ for @xmath128 the nonrelativistic quantum - mechanical potential model reveals the exact effective threshold @xmath129 to be close to @xmath130 for @xmath11@xmath108 also in qcd , the ld approach is expected to yield reliable predictions for the @xmath131 transition form factor in this @xmath44 region . taking into account the results for the  @xmath132  form factor derived from the @xmath2 and @xmath8 correlators",
    ", we conservatively estimate the accuracy  of  our predictions in this region of @xmath44 to be around 10% ; the accuracy improves rather fast with rising @xmath29 the numerical results  for @xmath133 from qcd sum rules may be well described by a monopole parametrization .",
    "combining the results  from the @xmath2 and @xmath8 correlators , we obtain @xmath134 + the lepage ",
    "brodsky approximate formula for the @xmath47 form factor @xcite , interpolating between the axial anomaly  at @xmath135 and the pqcd asymptotics at @xmath136 too may be cast into this form , with @xmath137 and the  relevant charge factor @xmath138 replacing @xmath139 for the pion , @xmath140 is close to the @xmath141-meson mass .",
    "thus , the predictions of ld qcd sum rules for both light and heavy pseudoscalars may be reasonably interpolated  by the monopole formula @xmath142 with the mass parameter @xmath20 not far from the mass of the ground - state vector meson with the relevant quantum numbers and @xmath143 the corresponding charge factor .",
    "we investigated the onset of the pqcd behaviour of @xmath133 and found that , at @xmath144 the form  factor already reaches about 90% of its pqcd factorization value .",
    "this conclusion does not depend on the choice of  the correlator and is thus a solid prediction of the ld qcd sum rules .",
    "the onset of the pqcd behaviour of  @xmath133 is delayed with @xmath145 compared to the case of the light pseudoscalars .",
    "note , however , that we predict a much  faster onset of the pqcd regime than a recent analysis @xcite , where the form factor at @xmath146 reaches only  65% of its asymptotic value .      30 cello collaboration , h.  j.  behrend _ et al .",
