    "the transition from quantum mechanics to classical physics is one of the most debated problems in the history of modern physics . in particular",
    ", the question arises why one can not observe macroscopic objects in a superposition of spatial distinct locations , despite the fact that all objects are made up of microscopic particles which indeed can be observed in such position superposition states .",
    "several conceptually very different solution to this problem were proposed , as e.g.  the theory of spontaneous localization  @xcite , which modifies the schrdinger equation by adding an incoherent part .",
    "less drastic _ approach is the theory of environmentally induced decoherence  @xcite .",
    "this assumes that the combined state of system and environment evolves according to schrdinger s equation , but if only the system density operator is observed , it seems as if the coupling to the environment destroys the quantum feature that a system can be in a superposition of several distinct states , a process known as decoherence .    during the last two decades",
    ", there has been increasing interest in the engineering of large quantum systems , e.g.  for quantum information processing . a major limitation to these efforts",
    "is posed by their fragileness to decoherence .",
    "therefore , a detailed understanding of different decoherence processes is no more just an academic problem , but necessary for future quantum technologies .",
    "a paradigm of environmentally induced decoherence is collisional decoherence , where the system of interest is a tracer particle , possibly macroscopic in size , which experiences random collisions with particles of a thermal reservoir .",
    "the colliding particles can be molecules , much as in brownian motion , but one could also think of photons of the cosmic background radiation .",
    "several authors put forward increasingly complicated master equations for a tracer particle in a thermal gas , first for an infinitely heavy tracer particle @xcite , and later for a tracer particle with finite mass @xcite .",
    "the latter were used to study collisional decoherence by applying quantum trajectory methods @xcite .",
    "however , the validity of the single collision calculations used in the derivations of the respective master equations for tracer particle with finite mass was recently questioned @xcite , and a consensus is still missing .",
    "the mechanisms by which an environment can destroy measurable superpositions can roughly be divided into two categories .",
    "first , the environmental state can get entangled with the system state .",
    "this effectively delocalizes the relative phase of any superposition state of the system into the combined state of system and environment . after tracing out the environmental degrees of freedom",
    ", this leads to a reductions of the coherences of the system .",
    "we say , the environment _ measures _ the system ( see figure  [ fig ]  ( b ) ) . in the second process , sometimes called phase averaging , the interaction with the environment changes the relative phase of the superposition state .",
    "if this phase change is random and different for each run of an experiment , then the coherence of the superposition state can no longer be observed ( see figure  [ fig ]  ( c ) ) . in some sense , phase averaging does not fundamentally destroy the coherences , but rather makes the relative phase unpredictable and therefore unmeasurable .",
    "one should mention that neither mechanisms completely solves the problem of the quantum - classical transition because the _ measurement problem _ remains  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , both mechanisms can successfully describe the observed lack of coherences of macroscopic objects .",
    "however , it is the first decoherence mechanism which is mostly cited in connection with the quantum - classical transition , possibly because is appears to destroy coherences more fundamentally compared to phase averaging .",
    "this view is especially maintained within the topic of collisional decoherence @xcite .",
    "although a colliding gas particle certainly carries away some information about the state of the tracer particle , we show in this article that the decoherence due to this information exchange is negligible compared to phase averaging .",
    "the latter arises because a collision adds a relative phase to a spatial superposition state , which depends on the momentum of the colliding gas particle and is therefore random .",
    "this article hence aims at a fundamental change of the understanding of the collisional decoherence process .",
    "because we are interested in a general understanding of the collisional decoherence process , rather than in details depending on a particular interaction model , we use the simplest possible model .",
    "that is , we assume that the tracer particle as well as the gas particles only move in one dimension .",
    "further , the gas is in a thermal state using boltzmann statistics , and we apply the low density and high temperature limit . within this limit",
    ", each collision is an independent event and we can neglect three particle collisions .",
    "the gas particles do not interact with each other ( ideal gas ) , and their interaction potential with the tracer particle is of the hard core type , i.e.  @xmath0 where the index @xmath1 labels the gas particle .",
    "let us briefly review a single collision following reference  @xcite .",
    "the effect of a collision on the tracer particle depends on the state of the colliding gas particle .",
    "therefore , we start this discussion with a convenient convex decomposition of the thermal density operator of a gas particle .",
    "a particular useful convex decomposition was given by hornberger and sipe  @xcite in terms of gaussian minimum uncertainty wave packets @xmath2 with @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 label the mean position and momentum of the wave packet , respectively , and @xmath6 labels the position uncertainty .",
    "it was shown that the density operator can be written as @xmath7 here , @xmath8 is the maxwell - boltzmann distribution , @xmath9 is a normalization length which is taken to infinity , and @xmath10 .",
    "the reason for a lower temperature in the maxwell - boltzmann distribution in eq .",
    "( [ convex ] ) is that part of the thermal energy of the gas particle has been transferred to being a contribution to the momentum uncertainty of the states @xmath2 .    with eq .",
    "( [ convex ] ) at hand , we can assume that every gas particle is in a minimum uncertainty state with position uncertainty @xmath6 , while the probability density for a particular combination of @xmath4 and @xmath5 is given by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the particle density of the gas .",
    "for a complete collision of the gas particle wave packet with the tracer particle wave packet , it is required that the velocity uncertainty of the gas particle state @xmath2 is small compared to the relative velocity of the two colliding particles .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that this is the case ( at least for most gas particles ) if @xmath13 , and therefore we will choose @xmath6 sufficiently large and approximate @xmath14 by @xmath15 in the following . furthermore , to avoid the discussion of three particle collisions , we require @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , the position uncertainty has to satisfy @xmath17 which is generally possible in the high - temperature and low - density limit @xmath18 note that this limit must also be satisfied to use boltzmann statistics to describe an ideal gas .",
    "it was further shown in @xcite , that , under the additional assumption of a slow ( compared to the gas particles ) tracer particle , the collision rate is @xmath19    it is well understood that if the tracer particle is initially ( at time @xmath20 ) also in a minimum uncertainty state @xmath21 , but with a position uncertainty @xmath22 related to the gas particle s position uncertainty via their relative masses according to @xmath23 then a collision results in the remarkable simple product state  @xcite @xmath24 here , @xmath25 is some time after the collision , and @xmath26 is the free evolution operator of the single particle . the mean positions and momenta after the collision relate to the initial values according to @xmath27 which are precisely the same relations as in a collision of classical particles .",
    "the relative mass is denoted by @xmath28 .",
    "the final state ( [ gausstrafo ] ) was derived in  @xcite by two different methods , and can also easily be confirmed by using the scattering operator for a one dimensional hard core interaction , i.e.  @xmath29 .    the reader should note that at no time the position probability distribution of either particle changes discontinuously , as might be suggested incorrectly by eq .",
    "( [ gasrelation ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ tracerrelation ] ) .",
    "the actual position probability distribution of the state  ( [ gausstrafo ] ) also includes the free particle evolution operator , and in @xcite it was shown that the evolution of the tracer particle in position representation is completely continuous , as can be seen in figure  [ fig1 ]  ( a ) .",
    "is indicated in ( b ) . ]",
    "we should point out that in this work we neglect the possibility of incomplete collisions of the colliding wave packets .",
    "therefore , our work is valid on a coarse grained time scale @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the collision time defined in  @xcite and shown in figure  [ fig1 ]  ( b ) . for this very reason",
    ", we will use a finite time interval @xmath32 to study the decoherence process .",
    "coherences of a quantum state are often described by the off - diagonals of the density matrix .",
    "this leads to the question : _ what basis should we use to examine decoherence ? _ the two bases which first come to mind are the position basis and the momentum basis , and indeed , these are the bases usually used in the literature  @xcite . nevertheless , they are not without problems .",
    "if one uses e.g.  the momentum basis , one would be interested in how long a superposition of the form @xmath33 survives , or , equivalently , how fast the coherences @xmath34 decrease .",
    "there is a major problem in this sort of question : a momentum eigenstate ( or any state which is very localized in momentum ) is itself a coherent superposition of widely spread position eigenstates , and one should expect that these position coherences of each individual momentum eigenstate do vanish on the same time scale , or even faster , as the momentum coherences of interest ! the same reasoning applies to using the position basis .",
    "our reservations are clearly related to the concept of a pointer basis  @xcite .",
    "pointer basis states should be fairly robust to decoherence .",
    "that is , if the system is prepared in one of these pointer states it will stay there for some time , whereas if the system is in a superposition of two pointer states , then the coherences typically decrease rapidly in time .",
    "these properties makes a pointer basis the basis of choice to study decoherence effects . because a momentum eigenstate is highly unrobust to position decoherence , the momentum basis is not a good pointer basis .",
    "similarly , a position eigenstate is unrobust to momentum decoherence , and therefore also not an appropriate pointer state .    to add some weight to our concern",
    ", we have a brief look at the decoherence rate found by  @xcite for an initial superposition @xmath35 of momentum states , i.e. their equation  ( 67 ) . inserting the definitions  ( 27 , 31 , 32 ) of @xcite and assuming that the velocity of the tracer particle is small compared to an average gas particle , their equation  ( 67 ) leads to the decoherence rate @xmath36 , where we changed the notations according to ours , and @xmath22 is a constant scattering cross section .",
    "this formula strongly opposes physical intuition because it predicts a decrease of the decoherence rate upon increasing the temperature , despite the fact that an increase of the temperature leads to more powerful and more frequent collisions .",
    "could we possibly single out a pointer basis from a measurement interpretation of a single collision ? we showed in  @xcite that a colliding gas particle @xmath2 performs a smeared out measurement on the tracer particle in the basis @xmath37 , indicating that these states could be used as pointer basis . we know from  eq .",
    "( [ convex ] ) , that we have a choice in the width @xmath6 of the gas particle states .",
    "therefore , we can use minimum uncertainty states of any width @xmath38 as pointer basis , as long as @xmath6 satisfies relation  ( [ limitation ] ) , which was required for the treatment of a single collision .    as is stated in e.g.  @xcite , there are still many open questions about the emergence of a pointer basis from the coupling to an environment .",
    "nevertheless , because of the heuristic reasoning in the previous paragraph , and the lack of sensible alternatives , we will indeed discuss decoherence by using superpositions of gaussian states @xmath39 , commonly referred to as _ cat states _ in the literature .",
    "we should note , that  @xcite superimposed several momentum eigenstates to produce a state similar to a cat state to study decoherence using quantum trajectory theory .",
    "this study was limited to the situation where the gas particle mass equals the tracer particle mass , and each collision leads to a complete loss of decoherence .",
    "we will need the transformation of an initial ( unnormalized ) cat state @xmath39 of the tracer particle upon a collision with a gas particle in the state @xmath2 . by using the linearity of quantum mechanics as well as eqn .",
    "( [ gausstrafo])-([tracerrelation ] ) , and after tracing out the gas particle , we find for the density matrix of the tracer particle after a collision @xmath40 u^\\dag(t ) .",

    "( [ tracerrelation ] ) , as well as @xmath42 , \\label{cbar }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is smaller than one because of a reduction of coherences due to a _ measurement _ performed by the colliding gas particle , and",
    "@xmath43 is a phase shift induced by the collision .",
    "we further defined the average position @xmath44 and the position difference @xmath45 ( analogous for momenta ) of the two cohering wave packets .",
    "note that the phase shift @xmath46 depends on the state of the colliding gas particle .",
    "if this state is random as in a thermal gas , the phase shift leads to phase averaging and therefore to a loss of coherences .    rather than using a density operator representation in terms of gaussian states",
    ", we found a wigner function representation ( see e.g.  @xcite ) more graphic to display coherences of cat states .",
    "decoherence can then be discussed in terms of the vanishing of the oscillatory behavior of the wigner function . in particular",
    ", we will compare the wigner function without a collision , to the wigner function with a collision .",
    "this way , we will obtain the _ `",
    "decoherence per collision ' _ , which can be multiplied with the collision rate eq .",
    "( [ rate ] ) , to obtain the decoherence rate .",
    "we wish to mention that a wigner function description of quantum brownian motion was already put forward previously in a very heuristic derivation  @xcite , as well as in a more precise approach , but limited to states of the tracer particle which are close to a thermal state  @xcite .",
    "both articles are concerned with the general form of a partial differential equation for the wigner function , and do not study decoherence .",
    "we will need the wigner function corresponding to a density operator of the form @xmath47 here , @xmath48 is bound between zero and one and is a measure for the strength of the coherences between @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and @xmath51 determines the relative phase between these states . in particular , an incoming tracer particle state",
    "@xmath39 before a collision corresponds to @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "using standard methods  @xcite , the wigner function corresponding to the density matrix eq .",
    "( [ state1 ] ) is easily found to be @xmath54 \\exp\\!\\left [ -\\frac{\\sigma^2(p'-p_a)^2}{\\hbar^2 } \\right ] { \\nonumber}\\\\          & \\hspace{-26mm}+ & \\hspace{-13mm}\\frac1{\\pi\\hbar}\\exp\\!\\left [ -\\frac{(x'-x_b)^2}{\\sigma^2 } \\right ] \\exp\\!\\left [ -\\frac{\\sigma^2(p'-p_b)^2}{\\hbar^2 } \\right ] { \\nonumber}\\\\          & \\hspace{-26mm}+ & \\hspace{-13 mm } \\frac{2c}{\\pi\\hbar } \\exp\\!\\left [ -\\frac{(x'-x_a)^2}{\\sigma^2 } \\right ] \\exp\\!\\left [ -\\frac{\\sigma^2(p'-p_a)^2}{\\hbar^2 } \\right ] { \\nonumber}\\\\          & \\hspace{-26mm}\\times & \\hspace{-13 mm } \\cos\\!\\left[\\varphi + \\frac{x_ap_d - p_ax_d}{2\\hbar } + x_d\\frac{p_a - p'}{\\hbar } - p_d\\frac{x_a - x'}{\\hbar }   \\right]\\!. { \\nonumber}\\\\ \\label{wgeneral }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as is well known , the strength of the coherences , indicated by oscillatory behavior of the wigner function , does not change due to the unitary free evolution .",
    "therefore , in the following , we will mostly use the interaction picture   by @xmath55 in eq .",
    "( [ wgeneral ] ) . ] .",
    "we can then use the general formula eq .",
    "( [ wgeneral ] ) , with @xmath52 and @xmath53 , to plot the wigner function of a state @xmath56 without a collision in figure  [ wcompare ]  ( a ) .    according to eqs .",

    "( a ) , and of the state resulting from a collision with @xmath2  ( b ) .",
    "parameters are : @xmath61 and @xmath62 . ]",
    "it is quite astonishing , that , despite choosing a gas particle with only four percent of the mass of the tracer particle , and , despite using a superposition of very close gaussian wave functions , almost all coherences are lost after a single collision .",
    "if we had separated the initial gaussians only slightly more , or had chosen only a slightly heavier gas particle , the coherences would be not visible at all , because @xmath59 in eq .",
    "( [ cbar ] ) decreases exponentially with these parameters .",
    "this observation is independent of the initial momentum and position of the colliding gas particle , as well as whether the gaussian wave functions are separated predominantly in position or momentum .",
    "it is therefore fair to say , that , unless the gas particle is much lighter than the tracer particle , the decoherence rate equals the collision rate .",
    "this result becomes even more pronounced , if we average over different initial gas particle positions and momenta , and we will study this effect in the following section for extremely light gas particles , for which the decoherence per collision due to information exchange of the colliding particles , @xmath63 , will be small .",
    "in this section , we discuss the more interesting situation , when a collision only partially destroys the coherences , which is the case if the colliding gas particle is extremely light ( mass ratios much smaller than one percent , as we will see ) .",
    "then , we need a more quantitative measure of the decoherence process , which we will develop below .    , but with different parameters for the gas particle : @xmath64 and @xmath65 . ]",
    "figure  [ wcompare2 ] shows how the wigner function of a superposition state changes due to a collision with a light gas particle .",
    "the coherences after the collision are still well resolved .",
    "the reason is that the measurement performed by the colliding gas particle is so imprecise , that it can not distinguish between the two gaussian wave functions of the tracer particle  .",
    "the main effect of a collision with a light gas particle is a shift of the entire wigner function in phase space .",
    "of particular interest is that the oscillating part just shifts from @xmath66 to @xmath67 , without acquiring an additional phase shift ( i.e. , the relative heights of the oscillating peaks do not change ) .",
    "this feature can be explained by looking at the argument of the cosine in eq .",
    "( [ wgeneral ] ) .",
    "the sum of the first two terms does not change in a collision , because @xmath68 equals @xmath69 , with @xmath60 taken from eq .",
    "( [ varphibar ] ) . the third and forth term account for a phase shift corresponding to the shift of the gaussian , i.e.  @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "of course , if the gas particle state @xmath72 is taken from a thermal gas , we have to average over all gas particle momenta @xmath5 , weighted by the maxwell - boltzmann distribution @xmath73 , as well as over all the gas particle positions @xmath4 which can reach the tracer particle in a given time interval @xmath32 . because each possible combination of @xmath4 and @xmath5 results in a different shift of the wigner function in phase space , it is clear that this procedure strongly suppresses the oscillations .",
    "this is the decoherence effect we referred to as ` phase averaging ' in the introduction .",
    "it can suppress coherences quickly , even if the measurements which the gas particles perform are very weak .",
    "let us close this preliminary discussion with a note regarding the collision rate . in the limit of a small mass ratio @xmath74",
    ", the tracer particle will be very localized compared to the gas particles , in both , position and velocity , as is evident from eq .",
    "( [ sigmarel ] ) .",
    "therefore , we do not have to use the full rate operator formalism developed in  @xcite , but we can simply assume that the tracer particle is reasonably localized somewhere near the origin , and a gas particle collides with the tracer particle during a time interval @xmath32 exactly if @xmath75 is satisfied .",
    "to study position decoherence , we consider an initial tracer particle state @xmath76 .",
    "an example of the corresponding wigner function is plotted in figure  [ wpos ]  ( a ) . the wigner function after a collision with a gas particle state @xmath2 is obtained following section  [ medi ] , but to study the decoherence due to a thermal gas , we average over different initial positions @xmath4 and momenta @xmath5 of the gas particle .    , and @xmath77 , respectively .",

    "the dependence of the ` decoherence per collision ' for low temperatures and short times turns out to be linear in temperature and quadratic in time , as shown in  figure  [ wmom ]  ( b ) . as a result , it is not possible to define a time independent decoherence rate for momentum superpositions .",
    "we will provide a physical interpretation at the end of this subsection , and first give a mathematical explanation of these results .    for this purpose",
    ", we consider again the oscillating cosine within the wigner function eq .",
    "( [ wgeneral ] ) @xmath129\\ ! , \\label{tfcd }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at its maximum @xmath130 .",
    "as discussed before , a collision does not change the sum @xmath131 in the cosine , and we only have to consider the change of @xmath132 to @xmath133 in the last term of the cosine .",
    "therefore , we find the ` decoherence per collision ' by averaging over @xmath134 . here , we need the normalized probability distribution @xmath135 of the initial position of the colliding gas particle , which is obtained from the probability density @xmath97 by integration over all @xmath5 , for which a gas particle with position @xmath4 can reach the tracer particle ( i.e.  @xmath136 , where the upper sign is for positive @xmath4 ) @xmath137 the distribution is normalized either by integration over @xmath4 , or directly by dividing by the collision probability @xmath138 . after substituting @xmath139",
    "we find @xmath140 and therefore    @xmath141    because this function represents the coherences after one collision , we have to subtract it from unity to obtain the ` decoherence per collision ' @xmath142    the solid lines in figure  [ wmom ]  ( b ) are taken from eq .",
    "( [ kfur ] ) , and agree well with the data ( dots ) obtained from the numerical wigner functions directly .",
    "the approximation in eq .",
    "( [ kfur2 ] ) is valid if the ` decoherence per collision ' is small .",
    "similar to position decoherence , we see from eq .",
    "( [ kfur2 ] ) that momentum decoherence due to information exchange ( @xmath143 ) is negligible ( unless for temperatures and times so small , that relation  ( [ colltime ] ) is violated ) .",
    "hence , we established that also momentum decoherence is due to phase averaging .",
    "at first , the increase of the decoherence rate with the considered time interval seems to be at odds with the uniformity in time in the following sense : if we split a time interval @xmath32 into sub intervals @xmath144 , the decoherence rate of the entire interval should be the averaged decoherence rate of all the sub intervals . if we now assume that the decoherence rate for each sub interval is the same ( `` uniformity in time '' ) , we would be lead to the conclusion that the decoherence rate for the interval @xmath32 equals the decoherence rate for the subinterval @xmath145 , clearly contradicting eq .",
    "( [ kfur ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ kfur2 ] ) .    in the above argument",
    ", we made the following conceptual error : by assuming the same decoherence rate for each sub interval , we implied the same initial cat state at the beginning of each sub interval . but instead , by the time the @xmath146-th sub interval starts , the cat state evolved to @xmath147 , and acquired a position separation @xmath148 .",
    "therefore , we have to add position decoherence for all but the first sub intervals .    in the limit @xmath149",
    ", there is no momentum decoherence in the infinitely small sub intervals at all , but instead , a continuously increasing position decoherence according to eq .",
    "( [ surprise2 ] ) , with @xmath150 . indeed , substituting this time dependent position separation into eq .",
    "( [ surprise2 ] ) and averaging over all times @xmath151 , one exactly recovers eq .",
    "( [ kfur ] )  ) from eq .",
    "( [ surprise1 ] ) . ] .    in other words , the decoherence which an initial cat state @xmath152 experiences during a time interval @xmath32 is perfectly explained by position decoherence of the evolving state @xmath153 .",
    "this leads us to the physical interpretation that momentum decoherence is not a direct process , but results indirectly from position decoherence due to position separation which the tracer particle acquires over time .",
    "we showed previously  @xcite that in one dimensional collisional decoherence , the quantity measured by a colliding gas particle does not only depend on physical parameters like density and temperature , but also on the choice of decomposition eq .",
    "( [ convex ] ) of the density operator of a thermal gas particle .",
    "it is therefore reassuring to find in this article , that measurement effects as a source of decoherence are negligible in the high temperature and low density limit , where eq .",
    "( [ convex ] ) is valid .",
    "the reason is that measurement effects are small compared to phase averaging effects , which arise from a random relative phase added to a superposition state during the collision process .",
    "we further arrive at a neat interpretation of the decoherence process of a superposition of two gaussians wave packets .",
    "the decoherence due to a collision depends on the position separation of the two gaussian wave packets at the time of the collision .",
    "in contrast , there is no direct decoherence due to the momentum separation @xmath119 of the two coherent wave packets",
    ". instead , over time , the momentum separation changes the position separation according to @xmath154 .",
    "this leads to an indirect influence of @xmath119 on the decoherence rate , which , if there is no initial position separation , is described by eq .",
