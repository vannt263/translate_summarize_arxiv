    "inclusive hadron production from @xmath1 annihilations is very valuable for testing quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) can give quantitative analytical predictions based on the modified leading logarithmic approximation ( mlla )  @xcite under the assumption of local parton hadron duality ( lphd )  @xcite .",
    "many experimental results have been reported from high energy experiments  @xcite @xcite , which are in good agreement with pqcd predictions .",
    "however , hadron production has not been studied well at low energies due to insufficient data , particularly at the boundary region between pqcd and non - pqcd .",
    "it is therefore very interesting to test pqcd in this region with low energy @xmath1 data .",
    "here we study the inclusive momentum spectrum , the hadron multiplicity distribution , and the second binomial moment .",
    "the inclusive momentum spectrum is defined in terms of the variable @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the momentum of the charged particles and center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "energy respectively .",
    "the second binomial moment  @xcite , a measure of the strength of hadron - hadron correlations and a sensitive probe for higher order qcd or non - perturbative effects  @xcite , is defined as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the charged particle multiplicity .",
    "there has been a long standing discrepancy between the values of @xmath0 calculated to next to leading order ( nlo ) and those measured in @xmath1 experiments @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we report measurements of the inclusive momentum spectra and multiplicity distributions of charged particles obtained with the upgraded beijing spectrometer ( besii ) at the beijing electron - positron collider ( bepc ) with center - of - mass energies of 2.2 , 2.6 , 3.0 , 3.2 , 4.6 and 4.8 gev .",
    "results are compared with pqcd calculations , as well as those from high energy @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 experiments .",
    "the measurements were done using the data collected for the @xmath9 scan  @xcite with besii , a conventional solenoidal magnet detector that is described in detail in ref .",
    "a vertex chamber comprising 12 tracking layers surrounds a beryllium beam pipe and provides input to the trigger system , as well as coordinate information .",
    "the primary tracking device is the cylindrical main drift chamber ( mdc ) .",
    "it has 40 layers of sense wires and yields precise measurements of charged particle trajectories ; it also provides @xmath10 information which is used for charged particle identification . outside the mdc",
    ", there is a barrel time - of - flight system ( btof ) consisting of an array of 48 plastic scintillator counters that are read out at both ends by fine - mesh photomultiplier tubes .",
    "electron and photon showers are detected in a sampling barrel shower counter ( bsc ) that covers @xmath11 of the total solid angle .",
    "it consists of 24 layers of self - quenching streamer tubes interspersed with lead ; each layer has 560 tubes .",
    "the outermost component of besii is a muon identification system consisting of three double layers of proportional tubes interspersed in the iron flux return of the magnet .",
    "the triggers and the measurement of the trigger efficiencies for bhabha , dimuon and hadronic events are the same as those described in ref .",
    "the efficiencies are measured by comparing the responses to different trigger requirements in special runs taken at the peak of the @xmath12 resonance , and are determined to be 99.96% , 99.33% and 99.76% for bhabha , dimuon , and hadronic events , respectively .",
    "their uncertainties are about @xmath13 .",
    "the hadronic event samples are almost the same as those used for the measurement of @xmath9 values at these energies .",
    "sources of background are cosmic rays , pair produced leptons , two - photon processes , and single - beam associated processes .",
    "first , clear bhabha events are rejected from the sample .",
    "next , hadronic events are selected .",
    "special attention is paid to two - prong events , where cosmic ray and lepton pair backgrounds are especially severe , and additional requirements are imposed to provide extra background rejection  @xcite .",
    "the hadron selection proceeds by first selecting charged tracks and then selecting events . for the track - level selection ,",
    "we require the track polar angle satisfy @xmath14 , the track must not be identified as an electron or a muon , and the distances of closest approach to the beam in the transverse plane and along the beam axis should be less than 2.0 and 18 cm , respectively .",
    "the following criteria are also used to define `` good '' charged tracks :    * @xmath15 , where @xmath5 and @xmath16 are the momenta of the track and the beam energy , respectively , and @xmath17 is the momentum resolution for charged tracks at @xmath18 ; * @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the energy in the bsc that is associated with the track ; * @xmath21 ( in ns ) , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the time - of - flight for the track and a nominal time - of - flight calculated for the track assuming a proton hypothesis , and @xmath24 is the btof time resolution . * @xmath25 0.08gev , where @xmath26 is the transverse momentum .",
    "the event - level selection requires at least two charged tracks with at least one `` good '' track satisfying the above requirements , the total deposited energy in the bsc should be greater than @xmath27 , and the tracks selected should not all point along either the @xmath28 or @xmath29 direction .",
    "these criteria help reject background . for two - prong events ,",
    "cosmic - ray and lepton pair events are removed by requiring that tracks should not be back - to - back and that there should be at least two isolated neutral clusters with @xmath30 mev and with the differences in azimuthal angle with charged tracks more than @xmath31 .",
    "this last requirement rejects radiative bhabha events .",
    "the above selection procedures remove most backgrounds .",
    "backgrounds from two - photon processes are negligible after hadron selection .    residual background contributions from bhabha processes and tau pair production are subtracted using a monte carlo analysis , e.g. for bhabha events , the number of bhabhas in the hadronic events is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the number of bhabha events surviving hadronic event selection , @xmath34 is the total number of generated bhabha events , @xmath35 is the integrated luminosity at each energy point , and @xmath36 is the total bhabha cross - section calculated by the monte carlo program .",
    "a detailed comparison between data and monte carlo data shows that the maximum discrepancy in any momentum bin is 10% ; hence the error due to the monte carlo simulation of bhabha events and tau decays is less than 1% in any bin , far less than the 5 - 10% statistical uncertainty .",
    "the beam - associated background is treated by fitting the distribution of event vertices along the beam direction with a gaussian for real hadronic events and a second order polynomial for the background , as described in refs .",
    "table [ hadron ] summarizes the background contributions to the hadron samples from bhabhas , tau decays , and beam - associated events .",
    "the typical background is a few percent below @xmath37 threshold and about @xmath38 above .",
    "we do not subtract the contributions from the @xmath39 , @xmath40 , or the @xmath41 resonances to the high energy points . using the resonance parameters from the particle data group  @xcite and varying them within errors , the contribution to the 4.6 gev point",
    "is expected to be below 2.2 % , while that at the 4.8 gev point is less than 1 % .",

    "[ peakstar ] , we obtain @xmath46 mev . this value is consistent with the results from opal  @xcite , zeus  @xcite and cdf  @xcite , which are @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 mev , respectively .",

    "the six bes lorentz invariant , charged particle momentum spectra are plotted in fig .",
    "[ dnall ] , together with those measured by other experiments at higher energy , up to 130 gev .",
    "the tendency of the spectra to approximately converge at lower momenta is cited as evidence that hadron production at very small momentum @xmath62 gev is approximately energy independent .",
    "this behavior has been explained in ref .",
    "@xcite as the coherent emission of low energy ( i.e. long wavelength ) gluons by the total color current .",

    "the charged multiplicity distributions are obtained using a method which was first employed by tasso @xcite and modified by h1 @xcite .",
    "three steps are used to correct the measured unnormalized charged multiplicity distribution @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the number of observed tracks .",
    "the first step is to correct for detector effects and selection criteria .",
    "it is performed using monte carlo sample ii with its hadron level information . for each event , the number of observed tracks @xmath67 with distribution @xmath68 is compared to the number of generated @xmath69 tracks with distribution @xmath70 . denoting @xmath71 as the number of events generated with @xmath69 tracks when",
    "@xmath67 tracks are observed and @xmath72 as the number of observed events with @xmath67 tracks , the correction matrix @xmath73 is expressed as    @xmath74    this matrix relates @xmath68 to @xmath70 by    @xmath75    the second step is to correct for the presence of qed initial state radiation which results in a reduction of the nominal c.m .",
    "energy and thus changes the charged multiplicity .",
    "therefore another set of correction factors is calculated according to @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the normalized multiplicity distribution for events generated at fixed c.m .",
    "energy without detector simulation and @xmath78 is the distribution @xmath70 after normalization .",
    "finally , the corrected multiplicity distribution @xmath79 reads @xmath80    the final step is done to reduce bias that might be introduced by the monte carlo generator used @xcite .",
    "an iterative procedure is used where the predicted multiplicity at the hadron level is reweighted using the previously unfolded multiplicity .",
    "this is repeated until convergence is reached .",
    "the measured multiplicity distributions at different energies are shown in fig .",
    "[ comnch ] along with the monte carlo predictions .",
    "figure [ meannch ] shows the energy dependence of the mean multiplicity defined as @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the probability to have @xmath8 tracks .",
    "based on the measured multiplicity distributions , we obtain the second binomial moments @xmath0 , which are displayed in fig .  [ r2bes ] , together with both nlo calculations and published data at higher energies up to 100 gev from other @xmath1 experiments .",
    "our measured @xmath0 values , though with large errors , are consistent with other measurements at higher energies .",
    "the @xmath0 value predicted by leading order qcd is significantly higher than the measured data , and while the nlo calculation comes closer to the data , the remaining disagreement of about @xmath83 in @xmath0 may indicate that @xmath0 is a sensitive probe for higher order qcd or non - perturbative effects .        .",

    "the parameters @xmath85 and @xmath86 obtained by fitting the limiting spectra are compatible with those of the zeus , cdf , and opal experiments .",
    "however , the deviations become larger at energies below @xmath87 gev .",
    "the second binomial moment @xmath0 determined by the bes experiment , though with large errors , are lower than what is predicted to nlo .",
