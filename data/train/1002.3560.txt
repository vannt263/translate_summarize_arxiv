    "the physics of complex systems has proven to be a fertile arena of investigation in very diverse areas of natural sciences .",
    "the versatility of the techniques of analysis and the wide applicability of the main underlying ideas make this subject interdisciplinary : there are applications in physics , mathematics , statistics , cybernetics , chemistry , biology , as well as economics and social sciences , this list being far from complete",
    ".    the guiding principles in the study of complex systems are philosophically intriguing , and lie in the idea that one can learn simple lessons from complexity @xcite .",
    "this requires the definition of an appropriate level of description at which the main features of the system investigated can be described in terms of a given number of suitable variables .",
    "the very definition of these variables and their interactions design a convenient  minimal model , \" whose dynamics , equilibrium features and correlations can be investigated .",
    "spin glasses play an important role in this context @xcite .",
    "a spin glass can be thought of as an ensemble of interacting spins , whose bonds are randomly distributed .",
    "the magnetic ordering that emerges resembles the positional ordering of a physical glass and is characterized by frustrated interactions .",
    "like all complex systems , a spin glass is composed of interconnected parts ( spins ) and as a whole exhibits properties that are far from being obvious if one looks at the properties of the individual parts .    in this article",
    "we shall apply a spin glass model to study a financial system @xcite .",
    "we shall seek an appropriate level of description at which capital losses can be schematized as interacting dichotomic variables ( spins ) .",
    "we shall focus in particular on  operational risk \" ( or ) @xcite , defined by the the new basel capital accord ( basel ii ) @xcite as `` the risk of [ money ] loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes , people and systems or from external events '' . or management @xcite is a subcategory of risk management , that branch of economy whose purpose is the identification of the possible sources of money losses and eventually the definition of a strategy for avoiding them . according to the regulations set by the  basic indicator approach \" proposed in basel ii , banks have to set aside 15% of their total capital , in order to face operational losses : since this is a quenched capital , banks share a keen interest in order to keep this percentage as small as possible .",
    "basel ii also proposes a slightly refined approach ( the `` standardized approach '' ) that defines eight different  business lines \" on which losses can occur , by associating to each of them a constant risk coefficient that can vary between 12% and 18% , so that the total amount of money to be stored by a bank is obtained by a weighted sum .",
    "the basel accord gives to each bank the possibility to propose an internally developed `` advanced measurement approach '' to estimate the capital to set aside .",
    "let us point out that , while the basic indicator approach and the standardized approach are aimed only to the estimation of this capital , the advanced measurement approaches are particularly attractive for a bank because they may be oriented to the management of or .",
    "every advanced measurement approach is required to classify the operational losses in the 8 afore - mentioned business lines and in 7 `` event types . ''",
    "there are therefore 56 combinations ( 8 business lines @xmath0 7 event types ) to be implemented .",
    "the objective of our study is i ) to accurately characterize these different losses , in order to ii ) understand the main features of their dynamics and interactions , and if possible iii ) minimize them .    in order to analyze the distribution of these losses",
    ", we shall model them via @xmath1 interacting variables , as proposed by khn and neu @xcite and elaborated by several authors in refs .",
    "this sets the afore - mentioned level of description at which techniques of spin glasses and complex systems can be applied",
    ". an efficient performance of this model requires knowledge of the frequency and value of each loss in the @xmath2 different channels and a distribution of such events . because basel ii is a rather recent treaty , real data are often insufficient .",
    "for example , some of the @xmath3 channels are often completely empty , so that rare events can not be included .",
    "also , some business lines ( e.g.  retail banking ) are often very populated , so that they tend to  overwhelm \" other lines when a statistical analysis is performed .",
    "finally , the populations can be very different for different banks , and can show significant variations according to , e.g. , bank size and geographical location . to focus , say , only on large banks , would not be meaningful , because one could aim at offering a service to _ many _ small banks ( say , minimize below 15% the percentage of the total capital to be put aside ) , by taking into account their peculiarities and characteristics in a given local context . to add to these difficulties , banks are often reluctant to disclose the details of their losses , for obvious reasons .",
    "we shall therefore opt for a democratic approach , by setting the parameters of our model to reasonable values , valid for a rather wide range of banks , and checking that our results are stable against small variations of these parameters .",

    "an additional point of interest , also in view of potential applications , would be to work towards the optimization of some crucial parameters of the model , such as the supports .",
