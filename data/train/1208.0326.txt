    "in this work , we study reaction - diffusion pde systems @xmath0 as well as their discrete analogues ( `` compartmental - systems '' ) . here , @xmath1 @xmath2 is the laplacian operator on a suitable spatial domain @xmath3 , and no flux ( neumann ) boundary conditions are assumed . in biology , a pde system of this form describes individuals ( particles , chemical species , etc . ) of @xmath4 different types , with respective abundances @xmath5 at time @xmath6 and location @xmath7 , that can react instantaneously , guided by the interaction rules encoded into the vector field @xmath8 , and can diffuse due to random motion .",
    "reaction - diffusion pde s play a key role in modeling intracellular dynamics and protein localization in cell processes such as cell division and eukaryotic chemotaxis ( e.g. , @xcite ) as well as in the modeling of differentiation in multi - cellular organisms , through the diffusion of morphogens which control heterogeneity in gene expression in different cells ( e.g. @xcite ) . from a bioengineering perspective",
    ", reaction - diffusion models can be used to model artificial mechanisms for achieving cellular heterogeneity in tissue homeostasis ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the `` symmetry breaking '' phenomenon of diffusion - induced , or turing , instability refers to the case where a dynamic equilibrium @xmath9 of the non - diffusing ode system @xmath10 is stable , but , at least for some diagonal positive matrices @xmath11 , the corresponding uniform state @xmath12 is unstable for the pde system @xmath13 .",
    "this phenomenon has been studied at least since turing s seminal work on pattern formation in morphogenesis  @xcite , where he argued that chemicals might react and diffuse so as result in heterogeneous spatial patterns .",
    "subsequent work by gierer and meingardt  @xcite produced a molecularly plausible minimal model , using two substances that combine local autocatalysis and long - ranging inhibition .",
    "since that early work , a variety of processes in physics , chemistry , biology , and many other areas have been studied from the point of view of diffusive instabilities , and the mathematics of the process has been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "most past work has focused on local stability analysis , through the analysis of the instability of nonuniform spatial modes of the linearized pde .",
    "nonlinear , global , results are usually proved under strong constraints on diffusion constants as they compare to the growth of the reaction part . in this note",
    ", we are interested in conditions on the reaction part @xmath8 that guarantee that no diffusion instability will occur , no matter what is the size of the diffusion matrix @xmath11 . we show that if the reaction system is `` contractive '' in the sense that trajectories globally and exponentially converge to each other with respect to a diagonally weighted @xmath14 norm , then the same property is inherited by the pde . in particular ,",
    "if there is an equilibrium @xmath15 , it will follow that this equilibrium is globally exponentially stable for the pde system .",
    "a similar result is also established for a discrete analog , in which a set of ode systems are diffusively interconnected .",
    "we were motivated by the desire to understand the important biological systems described in @xcite for which , as we will show , contractivity holds for diagonally weighted @xmath16 norms , but not with respect to diagonally weighted @xmath14 norms , for any @xmath17 .",
    "closely related work in the literature has dealt with the synchronization problem , in which one is interested in the convergence of trajectories to their space averages in weighted @xmath18 norms , for appropriate diffusion coefficients and laplacian eigenvalues , specifically @xcite , which used passivity ideas from control theory for systems with special structures such as cyclic systems , @xcite which extended this approach to more general passive structures , and  @xcite which obtained a generalization involving a contraction - like diagonal stability condition .",
    "our work uses very different techniques , from nonlinear functional analysis for normed spaces , than the quadratic lyapunov function approaches , appropriate for hilbert spaces , followed in these references .",
    "we start by reviewing several useful concepts from nonlinear functional analysis , and proving certain technical properties for them .",
