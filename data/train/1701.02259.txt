    "understanding the interaction between molecules and light is an important challenge , not only in basic science but also for technological developments , because it could lead to the efficient utilization of light in photo - functional materials .",
    "when molecules are irradiated by photons , the molecules undergo various photochemical processes to relax from their electronic excited states.@xcite non - radiative deactivation is an example of a process that plays a vital role in photo - induced structural changes of molecules that are used as photochromic and photomechanical materials.@xcite non - radiative transitions also act as a competitive deactivation pathway in light emission devices,@xcite reducing the quantum yield of emission .",
    "these non - radiative transitions are induced by the derivative couplings [ also often referred to as nonadiabatic coupling matrix elements ( nacmes)],@xcite which are the couplings between the electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom .",
    "we will mathematically define the derivative couplings in the following .",
    "efficient computation of derivative couplings together with nuclear energy gradients enables on - the - fly dynamics simulations of photochemical processes.@xcite it also allows for locating conical intersections between potential energy surfaces,@xcite which are the set of geometries where two or more potential energy surfaces intersect with each other .",
    "since the computational costs of these applications are strongly dominated by the underlying computation of the derivative couplings and nuclear energy gradients , development of quantum chemical approaches for their efficient and accurate evaluation has the potential to significantly advance what is considered to be the state of the art method in computational photophysics and photochemistry .    to achieve efficient evaluation of derivative couplings ,",
    "analytical differentiation techniques have been explored in the last few decades .",
    "historically , analytical derivative couplings for multi - configurational methods were first studied [ such as the state - averaged complete active space self - consistent field ( sa - casscf)@xcite and uncontracted multireference configuration interaction ( unc - mrci ) methods.@xcite ] these two models nevertheless have disadvantages : sa - casscf is essentially a mean - field model with static correlation treatment , and does not describe dynamical correlation ; unc - mrci is computational very demanding and is often used without double excitations ( i.e. , mrcis that does not describe dynamical correlation).@xcite    more recently , the analytical evaluation of derivative couplings for single - reference theories has been extensively investigated , including those based on equation - of - motion coupled - cluster theory ( eom - cc),@xcite configuration interactions singles ( cis),@xcite time - dependent density functional theories ( tddft),@xcite and their spin - flip variants.@xcite standard single - reference methods are , however , known to incorrectly predict the dimensionality of the conical intersection spaces between the ground and excited states , because they do not compute the states on an equal footing.@xcite there have been attempts to resolve this problem.@xcite in addition , spin - flip single - reference methods that treat the ground and excited states equally have been successfully applied to the computation of the electronic structure around conical intersections,@xcite yielding conical intersection structures that are in agreement with those obtained with casscf or mrci .",
    "there have nevertheless been discrepancies in the energies of the conical intersections between sf - tddft and casscf computations.@xcite to assess these models , especially for large molecular systems , the development of efficient multi - reference electron correlation methods for calculating derivative couplings is warranted .",
    "we therefore turn our attention to one of the most successful multi - reference models , complete active space second order perturbation theory ( caspt2).@xcite the caspt2 method is a post - casscf method that describes dynamical correlation up to the second order .",
    "it uses so - called fully internally contracted basis functions to expand the first - order wave functions for efficiency .",
    "the electronic structure around conical intersections can be accurately described by its multistate variant ( ms - caspt2),@xcite which diagonalizes an effective hamiltonian formed from the state - specific caspt2 wave functions .",
    "the ms - caspt2 method has subsequently been improved by the ` extended ' variant ( xms - caspt2)@xcite to remedy the erratic behavior of ms - caspt2 potential energy surfaces when the mixing is strong.@xcite note that this extension was first proposed by granovsky for uncontracted multireference perturbation theory.@xcite very recently , one of the authors and co - workers developed an analytical nuclear gradient program for caspt2,@xcite which forms the basis for the work presented herein .    in this work ,",
    "we report the derivation and implementation of the analytical ms - caspt2 and xms - caspt2 derivative couplings .",
    "the computer program has been implemented as an extension of the aforementioned nuclear gradient program .",
    "we note in passing that the interstate couplings studied for ms - caspt2 ( with partial internal contraction@xcite ) by mori and kato@xcite are part of the derivative coupling , which is what we call the ms - mixing term ( see below ) . in the following ,",
    "we first present the definition of the derivative couplings for ms - caspt2 and xms - caspt2 wave functions , followed by the working equations for analytically evaluating the ( x)ms - caspt2 derivative couplings .",
    "we compare the minimum energy conical intersections ( mecis ) of ethylene optimized by xms - caspt2 with those of unc - mrci .",
    "in addition , the shapes of the potential energy surfaces near the mecis of a cationic retinal model chromophore ( psb3 ) are investigated .",
    "we then present the mecis of stilbene and an anionic gfp model chromophore ( _ p_-hbdi ) optimized by xms - caspt2 .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the previous work relevant to the development of the analytical ( x)ms - caspt2 derivative couplings .",
    "we first present the xms - caspt2 theory that is the basis of this work .",
    "the definition of the derivative coupling is then presented , followed by an algorithm for the analytical evaluation of the derivative couplings for sa - casscf .      xms - caspt2 is a quasi - degenerate second - order perturbation theory on the basis of the casscf reference functions .",
    "the casscf wave functions are a linear combination of the slater determinants , @xmath0 where @xmath1 are the configuration - interaction ( ci ) coefficients . in the following , @xmath2 and @xmath3 label slater determinants , and @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 label reference functions . in xms - caspt2 ,",
