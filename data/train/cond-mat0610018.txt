    "for the electronic and optical processes in semiconductors involving states near the bandgap , the @xmath0 technique has been the first resort for many researchers  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 method was introduced by bardeen  @xcite and seitz  @xcite .",
    "luttinger and kohn extended the technique to degenerate bands to govern the valence band edge structure of common group - iv elemental and iii - v compound semiconductors as described by a @xmath1 matrix  @xcite . in the case of direct bandgap semiconductors , appending the lowest conduction band as well as including the spin - orbit split - off within the valence band lead to a @xmath2 matrix which is also known as the kane s model  @xcite .",
    "soon afterwards pidgeon and brown extended this to @xmath3 matrix by including the spin for all bands in the presence of an external magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "these measures have enlarged the number of coupled bands and also improved the overall agreement of the band effective masses with the experimental values . on the other hand ,",
    "their validity spanned only about 15% of the full brillouin zone  @xcite which can be for instance sufficient for the description of not too small excitons .",
    "however , they fall short for applications involving the larger portion of the brillouin zone such as the optical absorption spectra or the high - field transport characteristics . the classical work in the direction to extend the multiband @xmath0 to full zone is due to cardona and pollak  @xcite which resulted in a @xmath4 @xmath0 hamiltonian .",
    "after this period of progress over the technique , researchers especially for device physics applications have routinely employed the 4-band and the 8-band variants of @xmath0 together with the envelope function approximation for incorporating the confinement effects  @xcite . wood and zunger have termed this combination as the  standard model \" and they have compared it with the empirical pseudopotential method ( epm )  @xcite . both qualitative and significant quantitative errors were identified mainly due to @xmath5 and @xmath6derived states which were not accounted by the 8-band @xmath0 approach  @xcite .",
    "the particular concerns on the use of the envelope functions were relieved by foreman  @xcite as well as by burt who also clarified the correct operator orderings  @xcite .    for the nanotechnology applications involving quantum dots and nanocrystals ,",
    "the device sizes are reduced in all three dimensions which results in the sampling of the _ full _ brillouin zone .",
    "once again there is the necessity to extend the multiband @xmath0 to full zone for technologically - important semiconductors .",
    "the increase of bands also results in the proliferation of the so - called luttinger - like parameters which can not be easily extracted from experiments as was the fortunate case for 3-bands where effective masses were directly related  @xcite .",
    "one possibility is to make use of the tight - binding model as done by jancu _",
    "_ who have systematically determined the 14-band @xmath0 parameters from the 40-band tight - binding band structure  @xcite .",
    "another route is to resort to the classical cardona - pollak methodology  @xcite where the empty lattice plane wave basis is used ; richard _ et al .",
    "_ followed this approach which lead to 30-bands taking into account the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "an even simpler alternative is to make use of the already existing epm band structure data to generate the multiband @xmath0 parameters  @xcite .",
    "it is this last choice that we pursue in this work to obtain the multiband @xmath0 band structure for group  iv indirect bandgap semiconductors : si , ge , diamond and sic of the 3c cubic form . our basic motivation behind this choice is that these semiconductors act as embedded core materials for nanocrystals where the confinement effects alleviate the poor luminescence properties of their bulk counterparts  @xcite .",
    "however , the bulk electronic structure is nevertheless inhereted to low - dimensions , with the further complication from the interface states .",
    "we believe that for certain nanotechnology applications , full zone @xmath0 band structure that can easily be extracted from epm as demonstrated in the following sections may still be a suitable choice compared to more demanding atomistic approaches .",
    "the bulk crystal hamiltonian described by a local one - electron effective crystal potential , @xmath7 is given by @xmath8\\psi_{n\\vec{k}}(\\vec{r})= e_n(\\vec{k})\\psi_{n\\vec{k}}(\\vec{r})\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the free - electron mass , @xmath11 is the band index , and @xmath12 is the crystal wavevector . inserting for the bloch wave functions @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the crystal volume , we obtain the well - known the @xmath0 expression @xmath15u_{n\\vec{k}}(\\vec{r})=\\left [ e_n(\\vec{k})- \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_0 } \\right ] u_{n\\vec{k}}(\\vec{r})\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath16 .",
    "note that the cell - periodic functions @xmath17 satisfy a sturm - liouville type eigenvalue equation with the eigenfunctions being complete when all ( i.e. , infinite ) bands are included at a fixed wavevector @xmath12 , say @xmath18 . based on this completeness at a chosen @xmath18",
    "we can expand an arbitrary cell - periodic function , @xmath19 as @xmath20 inserting this form into the bulk hamiltonian given by eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) leads to the following eigenvalue equation that becomes exact as @xmath21 : @xmath22   b_{j\\vec{k},m\\vec{k}_0}=0\\/ ,   \\ , n \\in [ 1,n_b]\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath23 \\delta_{nm}+ \\frac{\\hbar}{m_0}\\left ( \\vec{k}-\\vec{k}_0\\right)\\cdot\\vec{p}_{n\\vec{k}_0,m\\vec{k}_0}\\ , , \\ ] ] and @xmath24 corresponds to the momentum matrix element .",
    "for computations , obviously one can not include infinite bands , so it is more viable to build up an expansion set from a number of band and wavevector combinations chosen with a physical insight mainly reflecting the band extrema states .",
    "in other words , rather than using a fixed @xmath18 we form an expansion over various band and wavevector indices , @xmath25 as @xmath26 since the cell - periodic functions are not necessarily orthonormal at different wave vectors , we define their overlap as @xmath27 hence , the expansion coefficients @xmath28 satisfy the following equation @xmath29 + \\frac{\\hbar}{m_0}\\left ( \\vec{k}-\\vec{k}_i\\right)\\cdot\\vec{p}-\\left [ e_{j}(\\vec{k})- \\frac{\\hbar^2k^2}{2m_0 } \\right ] \\right\\ } b_{j\\vec{k } , m\\vec{k}_i } u_{m\\vec{k}_i}(\\vec{r})=0 \\ , .\\ ] ] projecting to @xmath30 results in a generalized eigenvalue equation for the expansion coefficients @xmath31   b_{j\\vec{k } , m\\vec{k}_i}=0 \\ , , \\",
    ", \\forall n,\\vec{k}_s \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath32 also belong to the same chosen expansion set as @xmath25 ; here @xmath33   \\delta_{{n\\vec{k}_s},{m\\vec{k}_i}}+\\frac{\\hbar}{m_0}\\left ( \\vec{k}-\\vec{k}_i\\right ) \\cdot\\vec{p}_{n\\vec{k}_s , m\\vec{k}_i}\\ , , \\ ] ] with @xmath34 corresponding to the generalized momentum matrix element linking indirect transitions .    in summary ,",
    "one solves eq .",
    "( [ eqc ] ) for the desired band @xmath35 and the wavevector @xmath12 with the only ingredients being the band energies , @xmath36 and the generalized momentum matrix elements , @xmath37 .",
    "these can easily be extracted from a local pseudopotential approach ; the cell - periodic functions can be expressed in the fourier representation as @xmath38 where @xmath39 correspond to reciprocal lattice vectors and @xmath40 is the volume of the primitive cell .",
    "hence the overlap ( eq .  ( [ delta ] ) ) and",
    "the generalized momentum matrix elements ( eq .  ( [ genmommat ] ) ) are given in terms of fourier coefficients @xmath41 of the cell - periodic functions as @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively .",
    "( red symbols ) band structure for si . ]",
    "we apply this basic idea to group  iv indirect bandgap semiconductors : si , ge , diamond and sic of the 3c cubic phase .",
    "their local epm form factors are taken from refs .",
    "@xcite for si and ge , respectively and from ref .",
    "@xcite for the diamond and sic .",
    "spin - orbit coupling effects are neglected which can actually become significant for the case of ge  @xcite .",
    "another important technical remark is about the epm cut off energies : we observed that even though the epm band energies ( i.e. , eigenvalues ) converge reasonably well with cut off energies as low as 5 - 10  ry , the corresponding bloch functions ( i.e. , eigenvectors ) require substantially higher values to converge .",
    "the results to follow are obtained using 14 , 16 , 33 , and 22  ry for si , ge , diamond and sic , respectively .    using silicon as a testbed",
    ", we demonstrate how to choose and improve the @xmath0 basis set .",
    "first , we start with the four - band @xmath0 which is known to yield reasonable results for direct bandgap semiconductors like gaas .",
    "these four states are taken to be the highest three valence band ( vb ) states at the @xmath44 point and the lowest conduction band ( cb ) state at one of the @xmath45 points , ( 1,0,0 ) .",
    "the resultant band structure displayed in figure  [ fig1 ] indicates that apart from the four band edge energies even the band curvatures turn out to be wrong .",
    "to improve this situation , the eight - band @xmath0 is generated by employing the highest four vb and the lowest four cb states , all from the @xmath44 point .",
    "the agreement with the epm band structure shown in figure  [ fig2 ] is once again not acceptable due to remarkable deviation away from the @xmath44 point .",
    "also note that the heavy hole band acquires the wrong curvature along both the @xmath46 and @xmath47 directions . to remedy these shortcomings , we form a set by including from the @xmath44 point the band indices 1 to 8 ( as in the previous case ) , from the @xmath45 point bands 3 to 6 , and from the @xmath48 point bands 3 and 4 , and finally from the @xmath49 point the fifth band making altogether 15 states . here",
    "the band index 4 corresponds to highest vb , and 5 to lowest cb .",
    "the band structure of this pseudopotential - based 15-band @xmath0 approach is shown in figure  [ fig3 ] where excellent agreement is observed over an energy window of about 20  ev .    using the same states for the 15-band @xmath0 approach for the other indirect bandgap semiconductors ge , diamond and sic , we reach the same performance with si as displayed in figs .  [ fig4]-[fig6 ] , respectively .",
    "for the diamond which is a wide bandgap semiconductor , the full zone agreement is observed to span an energy window of more than 40  ev .",
    "( red symbols ) band structure for si . ]",
    "( red symbols ) band structure for si . ]",
    "( red symbols ) band structure for ge . ]",
    "( red symbols ) band structure for diamond . ]",
    "( red symbols ) band structure for sic in 3c cubic phase . ]",
    "the multiband @xmath0 technique can be systematically improved by including more bands .",
    "this is particularly needed for indirect bandgap semiconductors where 4- and 8-band approaches fail .",
    "the band coupling parameters which are in the form of generalized momentum matrix elements and the associated band edge energies for the selected states can be extracted from epm .",
    "the technique can also benefit from _ ab initio _ local pseudopotential band structure provided that the bandgap shrinkage due to local density approximation is corrected  @xcite .",
    "we believe that for certain nanotechnology applications , full zone @xmath0 band structure that can easily be generated with the inputs from epm as demonstrated in this work may become the suitable choice compared to more demanding atomistic approaches .",
    "therefore , what remains to be done is to check the performance of the proposed 15-band @xmath0 framework on several low - dimensional applications and to see whether the `` farsightedness '' of the conventional @xmath0 approach with the small number of bands @xcite is cured .",
    "i would like to congratulate prof .",

    "former supervisor , for his @xmath50 birthday and acknowledge his lasting inspiration with deep respect .",
