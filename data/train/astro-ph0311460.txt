    "the central @xmath2100 pc around the galactic center is an extremely complex region containing a variety of astrophysical activities : i.e. , cold and warm molecular clouds , star clusters / formation , supernova remnants ( snrs ) , and hii regions , to name a few . earlier galactic plane surveys with the _ tenma _ and _ ginga _ satellites have discovered the highly ionized fe emission line at @xmath3 @xmath2 6.7 kev , which is strongly enhanced toward the galactic center region @xcite .",
    "_ asca _ and _ bepposax _ observations have confirmed the presence of the ionized fe emission line as well as detecting emission lines from other highly ionized elemental species of si , s , and ar @xcite .",
    "these results suggested that the difuse x - ray emission in the plane and the galactic center regions arises from thermal plasmas with multiple temperatures and ionization states , although the temperatures of the individual plasma components are inconclusive ( e.g. , koyama et al .",
    "1996 ; kaneda et al . 1997 ; valinia & marshall 1998 ; park & ebisawa 2001 ) . the origins of these hot plasmas have been suggested to be multiple supernova explosions and magnetic confinement of the interstellar medium ( ism ) ( e.g. , kaneda et al .",
    "1997 and references therein ) .    besides the apparent hot thermal components , the presence of giant molecular cloud complexes ( e.g. , sanders et al . 1984 ) , as well as a number of hard x - ray emitting point sources near the galactic center ( e.g. , skinner et al .",
    "1987 ) has led to the prediction that fluorescent x - ray emission should arise where the cold , dense ism is illuminated by external x - ray sources @xcite .",
    "this proposed new class of x - ray sources has been discovered with _",
    "asca _ by detecting low - ionization - state fe line emission ( fei @xmath4 fexvii ) in the galactic center region emerging at a characteristic energy of @xmath3  @xmath2  6.4 kev @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of this low ionization , or `` neutral '' 6.4 kev fe line emission toward the galactic giant molecular cloud sgr b2 has successfully described this fluorescent x - ray emission from the molecular cloud in terms of an x - ray reflection nebula ( xrn ) model @xcite .",
    "strong past activity of the supermassive galactic black hole candidate sgr a * was proposed to be the primary external illuminating source to produce the observed neutral fe line emission from sgr b2 .",
    "a similar xrn feature has also been detected in another galactic center molecular cloud , sgr c @xcite .",
    "alternatively , such neutral fe line emission may also be explained by the bombardment of energetic electrons on metal - rich sn ejecta fragments @xcite .",
    "massive stars appear to be forming at several sites in the central few hundred parsecs @xcite , so the proposed unresolved sn ejecta scenario for the origin of the observed neutral fe line emission is plausible as well .",
    "the x - ray line emission from the hot / cold ism is therefore a useful tool to probe the origins of the complex structure of the ism in the galactic center .",
    "the poor angular resolutions of previous detectors were , however , insufficient for such studies in complex regions of the galactic center . with the superb sub - arcsecond angular resolution and good sensitivity in the 0.3 @xmath4 8 kev band , the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ provides an excellent opportunity to investigate the nature of the diffuse x - ray emission in the galactic center regions .",
    "preliminary results from earlier _ chandra _ observations showed that the diffuse x - ray emission features in the galactic center appear to have a variety of spectral and morphological characteristics @xcite .",
    "the interpretations of these diffuse x - ray features have however been highly speculative primarily due to the limited photon statistics with previous data .",
    "recently , we have performed deep observations of the galactic center with _",
    "the exposure has reached @xmath2600 ks , which is an order of magnitude deeper than previous observations , so that these deep _ chandra _ observations represent an unprecedented wealth of x - ray data on the galactic center .",
    "in fact , these _ chandra _ data have resolved over @xmath22300 point sources within @xmath220 pc of the galactic center @xcite .",
    "besides these point sources , including the target object sgr a * , the _ chandra _ data show a complex structure of the diffuse x - ray emission within the 17@xmath0 @xmath1 17@xmath0 field of view ( fov ) .",

    "a summary is presented in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "for the last three years , the galactic supermassive black hole candidate sgr a * has been monitored , as part of guaranteed time observation ( gto ) and guest observer ( go ) programs , with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) @xcite on board the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ ( table [ tbl : tab1 ] ) . as of 2002 june , combining 11 _ chandra_/acis observations ( except for obsid 1561a , which was severely contaminated by a bright transient source within the fov ) ,",

    "figure [ fig : fig1 ] indeed demonstrates the presence of diffuse extended x - ray emission features on a variety of angular scales .",

    "the soft nature of these loop - like features is typical of thermal shocks interacting with the galactic ism . considering significant star - forming activities in the galactic center regions ,",
    "these red , soft x - ray features are perhaps caused by supernova blast waves or stellar winds / bubbles .",
    "we also detect a few hard x - ray knots and filaments .",

    "in order to examine the overall distributions of the diffuse emission line features around the galactic center region , we construct _ equivalent width _ ( ew ) images for the detected atomic emission lines , following the method described by park et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . after removing",
    "all detected point sources from the broadband image ( see muno et al .",
    "[ 2003a ] for the details of the point source detection ) , subband images for the line and continuum bandpasses were extracted for each spectral line of interest ( table [ tbl : tab2 ] ) .",
    "these subband images were adaptively smoothed to achieve a s / n ratio of 3 @xmath4 4 .",
    "the underlying continuum was calculated by logarithmically interpolating between images made from the higher and lower energy `` shoulders '' of each broad line .",
    "the estimated continuum flux was integrated over the selected line width and subtracted from the line emission .",
    "the continuum - subtracted line intensity was then divided by the estimated continuum on a pixel - by - pixel basis to generate the ew images for each element . in order to avoid noise in the ew maps caused by poor photon statistics near the ccd chip boundaries",
    ", we have set the ew values to zero where the estimated continuum flux is low .",
    "we also set the ew to zero where the integrated continuum flux is greater than the line flux .",
    "we present the ew images of the fe he@xmath12 ( @xmath3 @xmath2 6.7 kev ) , the neutral fe k@xmath11 ( @xmath3 @xmath2 6.4 kev ) , s he@xmath12 + ly@xmath12 ( @xmath3 @xmath2 2.5 kev ) and si he@xmath12 ( @xmath3",
    "@xmath2 1.8 kev ) line emission ( figure [ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "we note that cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) and the particle background ( pb ) , both of which have not been subtracted in the ew generation , could have contaminated our ew images to some extent .",
    "we found that the cxb contribution to the observed fluxes is negligible ( @xmath131% ; e.g. , muno et al .",
    "the pb contamination appears to be more significant than the cxb and may contribute up to @xmath220%@xmath430% of the estimated continuum emission where the surface brightness is low .",
    "the ew estimations are thus affected by the pb contamination by up to @xmath220% .",
    "this embedded contamination is not however critical for our purposes of the ew images : i.e. , we intended to utilize these ew images in order to qualitatively investigate overall variation and distribution of the bright x - ray line emission over the galactic center region .",
    "we do not use the estimated absolute ew values unless the actual regional spectal analysis has been performed .",
    "the adaptive smoothing also introduces some systematic uncertainties for the small - scale , faint ew features which we do not rely on for the analysis .",
    "the large - scale ( @xmath14arcmin ) , relatively bright ew features are , on the other hand , consistent with the actual spectral analysis and are reliable in the context with previous observations ( see the following discussions and sections ) . despite the embedded uncertainties , these ew images are therefore useful as first - order information in order to investigate the overall variation of the x - ray line emission within the fov and to qualitatively discuss some noticeable characteristics .",
    "we also note that the line flux maps as well as the ew maps might also be useful to understand the line emission distributions . since the line flux maps show the _ same _ overall intensity variations as the ew maps , we do not explicitly present the line flux maps although our discussion on the line features is in parts based on the line flux distribution in addition to the ew variations .",
    "the fe he@xmath12 line ew is generally enhanced along the plane .",
    "the enhancements in the fe he@xmath12 line ew of this galactic plane component are marginal ( roughly around @xmath2400 ev ) , which is consistent with the _ asca _ measurements of the hard galactic ridge x - ray emission ( grxe ) component ( @xmath3 @xmath2 8 kev ) @xcite .",
    "this marginal ew enhancements are also consistent with those from the detected point sources in the galactic center @xcite",
    ". a fraction of this fe he@xmath12 ew should thus originate from unresolved point sources .",
    "the substantial ew variations on arcmin scales , however , suggest that a bulk of this hot fe line emission has a diffuse origin arising from a hot ( @xmath3 @xmath2 5 @xmath4 10 kev ) plasma .",
    "sgr a east is a strong fe he@xmath12 line source @xcite , and is immediately recognized as an extremely bright source with an @xmath21@xmath153 diameter in the center of the fe he@xmath12 ew image ( figure [ fig : fig2]a ) .",
    "the estimated fe he@xmath12 line ew is @xmath22500 ev @xmath4 5000 ev within the central @xmath230@xmath16 diameter region of sgr a east , which is consistent with the results from the spectral analysis by maeda et al .",
    "this strong fe ew appears to be from hot fe - rich ejecta heated by the reverse shock of the snr sgr a east as posited by maeda et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "the neutral fe ew is largely distributed along the plane , and , in contrast to the he - like fe ew , is strongly enhanced in the northeast of sgr a * ( figure [ fig : fig2]b ) .",
    "the bright , hard fe knots in the northeast of sgr a * ( regions 1 , 2 , and 3 in figure [ fig : fig1 ] ) are featureless in the fe he@xmath12 ew image ( figure [ fig : fig2]a ) , but remarkably bright in the neutral fe ew image ( figure [ fig : fig2]b ) .",
    "the regions to the northeast of sgr a * are also bright in the si and s ew images ( figure  [ fig : fig2]c and figure  [ fig : fig2]d ) .",
    "the si and s maps represent high ionization states in hot thermal plasmas which are typically produced by snr and/or star - forming activity .",
    "the extinction toward the hot s and si emission in the northeast of sgr a * is consistent with that of typical column density toward the galactic center ( see  [ sec : spec ] , also muno et al .",
    "2003b ) , which indicates the galactic center origin of the hot gas rather than a nearby foreground component .",
    "it is interesting that these high - ionization - state hot s , si material and the low - ionization - state cold fe sources are in general coincident in the northeast of sgr a*. on the other hand , albeit that the angular resolution and the positional accuracy of the ew images are significantly degraded due to the adaptive smoothing of faint diffuse emission , the one - to - one correlations between the bright s / si ew and the neutral fe ew enhancements appear to be weak : i.e. , the locations of the strong enhancements of hot and cold gas are probably not `` exactly '' coincident .",
    "these cold , neutral fe line emitting gas and the hot , ionized s / si line emitting plasma also appear to have galactic center molecular cloud counterparts ( see  [ sec : mc ] ) .",
    "these features suggest that the high- and low - ionization - state line emission might be associated with the star - forming / sn activities nearby to the dense molecular cloud complexes in the northeast of sgr a*. both of s / si and neutral fe ews are weak in the southwest of sgr a * , which appears to be caused by intrinscally less activities there ( for more discussion , see  [ sec : mc ] and  [ sec : disc ] ) .",
    "we perform a spectral analysis of a few diffuse emission features , particularly those with strong neutral fe ews .",
    "the individual acis observations comprising our images utilized different roll - angles : i.e. , the first three observations have @xmath2270@xmath8 roll - angles and the remainder @xmath280@xmath8 .",
    "the fe knots have thus been detected on either acis - i0 or acis - i3 chips depending on the roll - angle . about @xmath285% of the total exposure",
    "was taken with roll - angles of @xmath280@xmath8 , however , so the bulk of the photons from these fe knots have been detected on the acis - i0 chip .",
    "we thus utilize the response matrices appropriate for acis - i0 .",
    "the fe knots 1 , 2 , and 3 contain @xmath212000 , @xmath224000 , and @xmath211000 photons , respectively , and we bin the data to contain a minimum of 60 @xmath4 200 counts per channel for the spectral fitting .",
    "these emission features are fairly bright and have well - confined structures , and so we estimate the background contamination by extracting spectra from nearby source - free regions after removing all detected point - like sources from the data . for the spectral analysis of our cti - corrected data , we utilize the response matrices appropriate for the spectral redistribution of the ccd , as generated by townsley et al .",
    "( 2002b ) .",
    "the low energy ( @xmath3 @xmath13 1 kev ) quantum efficiency ( qe ) of the acis has degraded because of the molecular contamination on the optical blocking filter . although effects from this qe degradation on our heavily absorbed spectra are most likely negligible , we correct this time - dependent qe degradation by modifying the ancillary response function ( arf ) for each extracted spectrum by utilizing the idl acisabs software .",
    "the x - ray spectral characteristics of knots 1 and 2 are similar to each other : i.e. , a strong 6.4 kev fe emission line with underlying power - law continuum of photon index @xmath17 @xmath2 2 @xmath4 3 ( figure [ fig : fig3]a and figure [ fig : fig3]b ) .",
    "both spectra are heavily absorbed ( @xmath18 @xmath2 3.5 @xmath1 10@xmath19 @xmath20 ) and the photon fluxes are insignificant below @xmath3 @xmath13 4 kev .",

    "the spatial distribution and spectral x - ray characteristics revealed by the data suggest that some of the diffuse x - ray emission features in the galactic center be associated with the cold , dense component of the ism and/or active star - forming regions .",

    "this cloud also appears to be spatially correlated with the most prominent emission in the ew images , and with knot 3 in particular .",
    "this correlation may be best demonstrated by the high angular resolution 98 ghz cs ( j=2@xmath41 ) data @xcite overlaid with the neutral fe line ew image ( see the lower - left corner inset in figure  [ fig : fig4]c ) .",
    "the line - of - sight locations of the negative velocity clouds remains undetermined . except for knot 1 ( see below ) , the molecular emission in the @xmath425 to @xmath45 km s@xmath36 range appears to be anti - correlated with the s and neutral fe ew maps in the northeast corner of the fov ( figure  [ fig : fig4]a and [ fig : fig4]b ) .",

    "this possibly accounts for the observed low intensities in the broadband surface brightness and for the soft x - ray line fluxes to the south of sgr a*. the relative lack of detected x - ray point sources toward this 20 km s@xmath36 cloud @xcite is consistent with a strong absorption effect .",
    "we also note that the si , s , and neutral fe line fluxes and the ews to the southwest of sgr a * where the negative velocity cloud is present , but where the 20 km s@xmath36 cloud is absent , are weak .",
    "this stands in contrast to the strong line emission in si , s , and neutral fe toward dense clouds in the northeast portion of the fov .",
    "the low line fluxes in this southwest region can not be caused by absorption in the 20 km s@xmath36 cloud simply because of the absence of this cloud in this direction .",
    "it is also unlikely to be caused by absorption in the negative velocity cloud because there is no evidence for substantial obscuration of the x - ray point sources in this southwest region toward the negative velocity cloud @xcite .",
    "thus , the weak x - ray line features to the southwest of sgr a * , where the 20 km s@xmath36 cloud is absent , appear to be intrinsic : that is , this region is lack of supernova activity , or perhaps of energetic star - forming activity compared to the northeast regions .",

    "[ sec : spec ] , we realize that the characteristics of the knot 3 spectrum are consistent with those of knot 1 , except for the low absorbing column density which reveals the soft thermal component .",
    "the column density toward knot 3 ( @xmath18 @xmath2 1.5 @xmath1 10@xmath19 @xmath20 ) is consistent with typical columns to the galactic center @xcite .",
    "knot 1 ( and 2 ) , on the other hand , has significantly higher column ( @xmath18 @xmath2 3.5 @xmath1 10@xmath19 @xmath20 ) .",
    "we speculate that the larger column for knot 1 ( and 2 ) might be attributable to the negative velocity molecular cloud in this direction .",
    "consistent with this hypothesis is the fact that sgra east , which has the same column as knot 3 @xcite , is not coincident with emission in the @xmath425 to @xmath45 km s@xmath36 cs map ( figure [ fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "the apparent angular size of the @xmath425 to @xmath45 km s@xmath36 cloud to the northeast of sgr a * is @xmath26@xmath0 , so the physical extent is @xmath215 pc . if the bulk of the excess column toward knot 1 ( @xmath18 @xmath2 2 @xmath1 10@xmath19 @xmath20 ) is attributed to this cloud , a cloud density of @xmath30 @xmath2 4 @xmath1 10@xmath39 @xmath33 is implied . assuming a simple spherical geometry for the cloud , the total mass of the cloud is @xmath40 @xmath2 2 @xmath1 10@xmath41 @xmath42 .",
    "albeit crude estimates , the derived density and mass of the cloud are not unreasonable compared with other giant molecular cloud complexes in the galactic center . based on these x - ray absorption features , we therefore propose that this cloud is in the `` foreground '' of fe knot 1 ( and 2 ) , although some portions appear to be associated with knot 1 itself .",
    "the soft x - ray emission to the northeast of sgr a * , as presented by the s ew images ( figure [ fig : fig4]b ) , is apparently anti - correlated with the negative velocity cs emission , which can be accounted for by the presence of this absorbing foreground cloud .",
    "the bright , hard x - ray filaments to the northeast of sgr a * stand out for having strong neutral fe emission .",
    "the spectral characteristics of knot 1 , for example , are consistent with those of the sgr b2 and sgr c clouds , both of which have been plausibly described by an xrn model illuminated by past activity of sgr a * @xcite .",
    "knot 1 has a cometary morphology , with the `` head '' in the north and extended south by @xmath21@xmath0 , along a minor ridge of the negative velocity cs cloud .",
    "the spectral features of the strong 6.4 kev fe k@xmath11 line , a weak 7.02 kev fe k@xmath21 line , and the underlying continuum with @xmath17 @xmath2 2 are typical for the proposed xrn model @xcite .",
    "while the fe k@xmath11 ew of @xmath141 kev is weaker than that from the sgr b2 xrn @xcite , it nonetheless suggests that the fe line emission is dominated by irradiation from external sources ( sunyaev & churazov 1998 and references therein ) . since the thomson cross - section is dependent on the scattering angle of the incident photon , while the fluorescent line emission is isotropic , the observed ew  the ratio of fluorescent line intensity to the scattered continuum  is inversely proportional to 1 + cos@xmath43@xmath44 , where @xmath44 is the angle subtended at the scatterer between the observer and the illuminating source .",
    "if we assume that sgr a * was the primary external illuminating source for knot 1 , the lower fe ew for the knot 1 spectrum , relative to that of sgr b2 , therefore suggests that @xmath44 is near 0 or @xmath45 and thus that the primary reflecting cloud toward knot 1 is located in front of or behind the plane between sgr a * and sgr b2 .",
    "( the ew may as well depend on other cloud parameters , such as the optical depth , abundances , and the ionization state .",
    "extensive studies of the determinants of the ew characteristics may thus require detailed xrn simulations , which are beyond the scope of the current work . )",
    "the fe k@xmath21 to k@xmath11 line flux ratio , @xmath20.15 , is consistent with the laboratory prediction for the xrn model @xcite .",
    "the sharp absorption edge at @xmath3 @xmath2 7.1 kev is also in good agreement with previously reported xrn interpretations @xcite .",
    "the strong neutral fe line emission from knot 1 is thus well described by the xrn model .",
    "knot 2 shares the overall spectral characteristics of knot 1 .",
    "however , the molecular counterpart is weak or absent for knot 2 , and the apparent absence of the fe k@xmath21 line in the knot 2 spectrum is problematical for the xrn model .",
    "the identification of knot 2 as an xrn might thus be inconclusive .",
    "the knot 3 spectrum shows similar features to the knot 1 spectrum in the hard band ( @xmath3 @xmath25 4 kev ) , but reveals a substantial contribution from a thermal component in the soft band ( @xmath3 @xmath26 4 kev ) . the implied electron temperature ( @xmath28 @xmath2 0.3 kev ) and",
    "likely high abundances might be suggestive of emission from sn ejecta heated by a blast wave reverse shock .",
    "this suggested contribution from snr(s ) to the observed knot 3 spectrum is not surprising because there are dense molecular cloud complexes in these regions of the galactic center , which may contain active star - forming regions .",
    "in fact , the cs maps indicate associations of dense clouds with the x - ray emitting material at the position of knot 3 ( figures  [ fig : fig4]c,[fig : fig4]d,[fig : fig4]e , and [ fig : fig4]f ) .",
    "based on the xrn model , a past state of dramatically enhanced activity of sgr a * , with an x - ray luminosity of @xmath46 @xmath14 10@xmath47 ergs s@xmath36 , has been proposed as the primary external illuminating source for the sgr b2 and sgr c clouds @xcite .",
    "the overall large - scale geometry of the neutral fe ew enhancements to the northeast of sgr a * is consistent with the fe emission lying predominantly within a conical region with an apex toward sgr a * ( figure [ fig : fig2]b ) .",
    "we thus consider that sgr a * might have also been the external irradiating source for the detected neutral fe knots . in the reflection models ,",
    "the luminosity of the irradiating external source can be derived in terms of the observed 6.4 kev photon flux , the distance to the reflecting cloud from the source , and the apparent angular size of the cloud as viewed from the source position @xcite .",
    "assuming a solar abundance for fe and a thomson scattering depth @xmath48@xmath49 @xmath2 0.1 ( @xmath18 @xmath2 10@xmath19 @xmath20 ) , we derive an irradiating luminosity from sgr a * , @xmath46 @xmath2 10@xmath50 ergs s@xmath36 for knot 1 and @xmath46 @xmath2 10@xmath51 ergs s@xmath36 for knot 3 .",
    "these luminosities are @xmath22 @xmath4 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of the quiescent state flux of sgr a * @xcite , but only @xmath260.1% of those which might have produced the xrne in sgr b2 and sgr c clouds .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of sgr a * from the recently detected @xmath23 hr flaring event ( @xmath46 @xmath2 10@xmath50 ergs s@xmath36 ; baganoff et al .",
    "[ 2001 ] ) is comparable to the derived irradiating luminosity . considering the physical sizes of these fe knots ( @xmath22 pc for the angular sizes of @xmath21@xmath0 at @xmath10 = 8 kpc ) ,",
    "however , the duration of the irradiating event must have been a few years or longer instead of on the order of @xmath2hours .",
    "the inferred sgr a * activity , if it was the irradiating source , should thus have been persistent much longer than the observed short flares .",
    "the inferred irradiating luminosities might have also been generated by galactic transient sources such as low mass x - ray binaries .",
    "there are likely a number of transient sources in active regions such as the galactic center .",
    "in fact , several transient x - ray sources have been detected near the galactic center with x - ray luminosities of @xmath46 @xmath2 10@xmath50 @xmath4 10@xmath52 ergs s@xmath36 ( e.g. , branduardi et al .",
    "1976 ; maeda et al . 1996",
    "; pavlinsky et al .",
    "although durations of x - ray transient outbursts can be as long as a decade , typical burst periods are relatively short on the order of months .",
    "( e.g. , wijnands 2001 ) .",
    "the nearby x - ray transient sources may thus not be completely ruled out as contributors to the observed neutral fe line emission , but unlikely . in terms of continuous irradiation sources , it is noteworthy that the derived irradiating fluxes are consistent with the x - ray luminosity of sgr a east @xcite .",
    "the sky position of sgr a east is between sgr a * and the fe knots , and so the steady emission from sgr a east might have also contributed the reflected neutral fe line emission at the positions of the observed fe knots . the measured temperatures for sgr a east , @xmath28 @xmath2 2 kev with _ chandra _ @xcite and @xmath28 @xmath2 4 kev with _ xmm - newton _",
    "@xcite , however , appear to be too soft to produce a strong fe line at @xmath3 = 6.4 kev . moreover , if sgr a east is a steady illuminating source capable of producing the observed xrn features , a strong 6.4 kev fe line feature would also have been expected from the nearby neutral ism , for example , the circumnuclear disk of sgr a * ( e.g. , latkoski et al .",
    "1999 and references therein ) , which is apparently not the case .",
    "steady emission from sgr a east is thus ruled out as a primary irradiating source .    alternatively , the characteristic 6.4 kev fe line emission may originate from unresolved sn ejecta . fast nonthermal particles accelerated by the fermi mechanism in collisionless magnetohydrodynamic shocks diffuse through cold , metal - rich ejecta knots , and produce low - ionization - state k@xmath11 line x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "this is most effective when the ejecta knot is propagating through dense clouds ( @xmath37 @xmath2 1000 @xmath33 ) @xcite .",
    "the model predicts an underlying , non - thermal bremsstrahlung continuum which is harder ( @xmath17 @xmath2 1.5 ) than that expected from the xrn model ( @xmath17 @xmath2 2 ) .",
    "x - ray line broadenings caused by the fast - moving unresolved sn ejecta are also expected .",
    "the presence of the soft thermal component , particularly in knot 3 , could be apparent evidence for such a contribution from unresolved sn ejecta .",
    "although the observed continuum of knot 3 appears to be softer than the typical prediction from the sn ejecta model , the large uncertainties on the best - fit photon index of the observed underlying continuum still make the ejecta model a plausible candidate to describe the spectum .",
    "although a soft thermal component is not detected from knot 1 and knot 2 , the neutral fe line characteristics are nearly identical for all of these knots .",
    "the absence of soft thermal component from knot 1 and knot 2 may thus be merely due to absorption , and then the supernova ejecta model can not be ruled out as a source of knot 1 and knot 2 as well .",
    "the estimated fe line luminosity ( @xmath46 @xmath2 10@xmath53 ergs s@xmath36 ) can be produced by fast - moving ejecta from a single sn explosion interacting with a dense molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "we note that large - scale correlations between the neutral fe line and the sio ( j=1@xmath40 ) emission in the galactic center regions have been observed @xcite .",
    "this gas phase sio emission due to grain processing by strong shocks , being spatially coincident with the 6.4 kev fe line features , may support the sn ejecta origin of the neutral fe line emission in the galactic center .",
    "one way to distinguish between the xrn and sn ejecta models is to make conclusive measurements of the fe line broadenings .",
    "the detector position of knot 3 is close to the ccd readout ( rows @xmath26 256 ) , so that the energy resolution is achieved down to the instrumental limit ( @xmath2150 ev fwhm ) @xcite .",
    "the measured line width of the 6.4 kev line is then @xmath24 = 10@xmath54 ev for the fitted gaussian line profile .",
    "this is only a weak detection of line width , yet suggests that the fe line width might have been resolved , thus indicating a line broadening in this region . if confirmed ( by follow - up observations ) , this line broadening would provide support for the contribution from unresolved sn ejecta to the observed neutral fe line emission .",
    "observations with instruments of good spectral resolution such as _ astro - e2 _ should be helpful for this purpose .",
    "better constraints on the photon index of the underlying continuum may also be helpful in order to understand the detailed nature of these features .",
    "follow - up deep observations with _ xmm - newton _ , by utilizing the high sensitivity compared to the _ chandra_/acis , would be useful for this purpose .",
    "the sn ejecta model also predicts strong infrared emission from the radiative shocks that accompany ejecta fragments @xcite , and so infrared line observations would help to discriminate models as well .",
    "although the sn ejecta contribution to the observed neutral fe line emission appears to be plausible , we note a caveat that non - thermal radio emission features have not been reported in the northeast regions of sgr a * within the acis fov .",
    "this absence of the non - thermal radio features is thus admittedly a difficult problem in terms of the snr interpretation .",
    "the presence of highly ionized elemental species , si , s , and fe indicates that thermal diffuse x - ray emission , as well as the nonthermal component , also prevails in the galactic center .",
    "these emission lines from the he - like species over the wide range of photon energies ( @xmath3 @xmath2 2 kev for si / s and @xmath3 @xmath2 7 kev for fe ) confirm the multiple - temperature origin for the diffuse thermal emission in the galactic center / plane as indicated by the _ asca",
    "_ data ( e.g. , kaneda et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the thermal components are , with some exceptions of bright features near sgr a * , relatively faint and large - scale features .",
    "the direct spectral analysis of this diffuse thermal emission thus requires substantially more careful treatment than the bright , well - confined , nonthermal neutral fe line features .",
    "we will present the extensive spectral analysis of the galactic center thermal diffuse x - ray emission in subsequent papers ( muno et al . 2003b ; morris et al .",
    "2003 , in preparation ) .",
    "we here qualitatively discuss the overall characteristics of the thermal emission based primarily on the image analysis .",
    "the si and s line ews trace enhancements of the soft component of the thermal emission , which is enhanced to the northeast of sgr a * ( figure [ fig : fig2]c and figure [ fig : fig2]d ) .",
    "these regions are close to the radio arc and the arches cluster , where the formation of massive stars has taken place in at least two episodes over the past 5 million years ( figer et al .",
    "1999 ; yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "massive galactic center molecular clouds are present in these regions ( c.f . ,   [ sec : mc ] ) , so the observed si and s line emission most likely arises from the hot ism heated by powerful stellar winds and/or supernova blast waves .",
    "as we have discussed in previous sections , the overall broadband x - ray surface brightness and the s / si ews are low in the southwest regions , which is uncorrelated with the absorption effect .",
    "this suggests that the active star forming processes are present _ only _ in the northeast of sgr a * and that such activity is not manifested in the southwest .",
    "knot 3 provides a sample spectrum of this soft thermal component .",
    "as presented in the previous section , this thermal spectrum shows characteristics typical of hot plasma produced by snrs .",
    "the _ asca _ observations of the grxe have successfully demonstrated that the soft component emission in the plane can be furnished by snrs with a sn rate of @xmath2one per century @xcite .",
    "for the case of knot 3 , the angular size of the emission region ( @xmath21@xmath0 ) corresponds to @xmath22 pc at a distance of 8 kpc , which is typical for young galactic snrs , but might also be of a relatively older age in a dense environment such as the galactic center .",
    "the hard thermal component is representd by the he - like fe line ew ( figure  [ fig : fig2]a ) . except for the brightest central feature of sgr a east , the highly ionized fe line emission is primarily distributed along the plane .",
    "in contrast to the other ews in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] , this hot fe emission shows no particular enhancements in the northeast of sgr a*. the _ asca _ data suggested that this hot component might not be adequately described by the snrs , because such a hot plasma may not be confined in the plane by the galactic gravity and/or by typical interstellar pressure @xcite . in order to maintain this hot plasma in the plane , a high sn rate and a low ionization state of the plasma",
    "are required @xcite .",
    "the electron temperature of the plasma required to produce the observed strong 6.7 kev fe line emission ( @xmath28 = 5 @xmath4 10 kev ) is also unusually high for typical snrs , although we do detect the 6.7 kev fe line from metal - rich ejecta in young snrs ( e.g. , hughes et al .",
    "2000 ; lewis et al .",
    "2003 ) . this hot gas with @xmath28 @xmath2 5@xmath410 kev might rather have been produced when cooler plasma is confined and compressed by strong galactic magnetic fields @xcite . the required magnetic field strength to achieve this is @xmath55 = 20@xmath430 @xmath56 g .",
    "the interstellar magnetic field in the galactic center ( @xmath55 @xmath21 mg , e.g. , yusef - zadeh & morris 1987 ; lang et al .",
    "1999 ) is sufficiently high for this model .",
    "this magnetic confinement model might not require recent massive star - forming activity or sn explosions in order to produce the observed hot plasma .",
    "the relatively uniform distribution of the he - like fe ew along the plane may also indicate this hot plasma s association with the strong magnetic field in the galactic center along the plane rather than with star - forming regions .",
    "deep _ chandra_/acis observations of the galactic center reveal a complex spatial and spectral structure of diffuse x - ray emission with significant photon statistics . the thermal ( e.g. , hot si and s ) and nonthermal ( e.g. , neutral fe ) x - ray line emission is generally enhanced in a region lying to the northeast of sgr a * , a region in which massive star - formation has been active over the past 5 million years ( e.g. , the arches cluster ) , and in which dense galactic center molecular clouds are currently present .",
    "the highly ionized line emission from si and s in these regions is therefore most likely associated with the hot ism heated by the shocks from sne and/or massive stellar winds , while shocks interacting with dense , cold ism may produce emission in the neutral fe line .",
    "curiously , we detect little or no enhancement of the emission lines to the south and southwest of sgr a*. this weak line emission to the south is apparently the result of an absence of activity there , in contrast to the northeast regions , and it is owed in part to the substantial absorption by the foreground 20 km s@xmath36 cloud .",
    "in contrast , the highly ionized he - like fe line emission shows a more uniform distribution along the plane , with no apparent enhancements to the northeast of sgr a*. this feature suggests that the young star - forming and/or sne activities have less effect on the he - like fe distribution than they do on the neutral fe line emission .",
    "the hot fe line emission might rather be caused by the hot ism trapped and then heated by the strong galactic center magnetic fields .",
    "the spectral characteristics of the strong neutral fe line emitting features to the northeast of sgr a * are plausibly described by the xrn model .",
    "we identify dense molecular counterparts for these fe knots , which is strong support for the hypothesized xrn origin . if past activity of sgr a * is the primary external illuminating source , the required luminosities are @xmath46 @xmath2 10@xmath50@xmath410@xmath51 ergs s@xmath36 with durations of at least a few years .",
    "alternatively , nonthermally - accelerated electrons by sn shocks penetrating back into dense , cold supernova ejecta may also explain the observed neutral fe line features .",
    "the presence of active star - forming regions and the dense molecular clouds near the neutral fe features are supportive of this scenario .",
    "unambiguous discriminations between these models are however difficult with the current data .",
    "follow - up observations with the current and upcoming observatories may be helpful for a detailed understanding of the origins for these features .",

    "<S> over the last three years , the galactic center region has been monitored with the _ chandra x - ray observatory_. besides the x - ray emission from the target object , sgr a * , diffuse x - ray emission was detected throughout most of the 17@xmath0 @xmath1 17@xmath0 field of view . with 11 </S>",
    "<S> _ chandra _ observations through 2002 june , the total effective exposure reaches @xmath2590 ks , providing significant photon statistics on much of the detailed structure within the faint , often filamentary , diffuse x - ray emission . </S>",

    "<S> the detected elemental species of the galactic center region demonstrate that the diffuse x - ray features have a broad range of spatio - spectral properties . </S>",
    "<S> enhancements of the low - ionization - state fe line emission ( @xmath3 @xmath2 6.4 kev ) to the northeast of sgr a * can be interpreted as fluorescence within the dense interstellar medium resulting from irradiation by hard , external x - ray sources . </S>",
    "<S> they may also be explained by emission induced by the bombardments by high energy particles on the ambient medium , such as may accompany unresolved supernova ejecta intruding into dense interstellar medium . </S>",
    "<S> the detection of molecular cloud counterparts to the 6.4 kev fe line emitting features indicates that these fe line features are associated with dense galactic center clouds and/or active star - forming regions , which strongly supports the proposed origins of the x - ray reflection and/or supernova ejecta for the fe line emission . </S>",
    "<S> we detect highly ionized s and si lines which are generally coincident with the low - ionization - state fe line emission and the dense molecular clouds in the northeast of sgr a*. these hot plasmas are then most likely produced by massive star - forming activities and/or supernova remnants in the galactic center . in contrast , we find that highly ionized he - like fe line emission ( @xmath3 @xmath2 6.7 kev ) is primarily distributed along the plane instead of being concentrated in the northeast of sgr a*. the implied high temperature and the relatively uniform , but , strong alignment along the plane are consistent with the magnetic confinement model , suggesting this hot gas component has been re - heated by the strong interstellar magnetic fields in the galactic center to produce the observed he - like fe line emission . </S>"
