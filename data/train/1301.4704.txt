    "anomalous diffusion is usually described within a framework of the continuous time random walk in which the probability densiy of finding a random walker at time @xmath6 at point @xmath7 , @xmath8 , depends on the probability density of the waiting time of the random walker to take its next step @xmath0 and the probability density of jump length @xmath9 .",
    "when @xmath0 and @xmath9 are independent then the probability density @xmath8 reads in terms of the laplace transform @xmath10 and the fourier transform @xmath11 @xcite @xmath12 as far as we know , an inverse transform of the above equation in the most general case has not been found yet , with the expection of a few very special cases .",

    "a subdiffusion equation which is obtained as a result of continuous time random walk formalism is a linear differential equation with a fractional time derivative .",

    "such a process qualitatively differs from subdiffusion and is usually called slow  subdiffusion .",
    "it is rather difficult to find an equation with fractional derivatives which describes such a process since an order of the derivative would be very close to zero .",

    "we arbitrarily chose the values of the parameters @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath5 . in order to match green functions for slow  subdiffusion and subdiffusion for all times",

    "we have encountered a similar situation when we have approximated the solution to nonlinear sundiffusion equations by the solution to the subdiffusion equation with a fractional time derivative with the subdiffusion coefficient depending on time .",
