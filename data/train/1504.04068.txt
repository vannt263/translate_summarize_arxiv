    "molecular clouds comprise the densest regions of the interstellar medium , and are the nurseries in which stars form . in order to determine how molecular clouds themselves form ,",
    "surveys of the three principal forms of carbon ( i.e.  c@xmath12 , c and co ) are needed to trace the gas in its ionised , atomic and molecular forms respectively .",
    "in particular , surveys along the galactic plane , where the great majority of molecular clouds lie , provide us with a picture of the molecular structure of our galaxy .",
    "the mopra southern galactic plane co survey is designed to map the distribution and dynamics of the carbon monoxide ( co ) molecule along the fourth quadrant of the galaxy , from @xmath13@xmath14 with @xmath2 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper i ) . using the mopra radio telescope ,",
    "the @xmath15 = 10 line of co at 2.6 mm is being mapped at 35arcsec spatial and 0.1kms@xmath6 spectral resolution , in order to determine where giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) lie in the galaxy and to explore the connection between molecular clouds and the ` missing ' gas inferred from gamma - ray observations .",
    "the co data will be combined with similar survey data collected of the sub - millimetre neutral carbon line ( c ) taken with the nanten2 telescope in chile , and the terahertz neutral and ionized carbon lines ( c and c@xmath12 ) from the balloon - borne stratospheric terahertz observatory 2 ( sto2 ) and the ice - bound high elevation antarctic telescope ( heat ) , both in antarctica . with these surveys",
    "it will be possible to determine the distribution and motion of the principal forms of carbon in the interstellar medium .",
    "data release 1 ( hereafter dr1 ) covers the first ten square degrees of the survey , from @xmath16@xmath1 with @xmath17 , along with an additional three half - square degrees over @xmath3@xmath1 , @xmath4@xmath5 ( see figures [ fig1-map ] & [ fig1-map2 ] ) .",
    "the g323 sightline has previously been published in paper i , however , it is discussed here because the g323 data was taken in the summer months and compares less favourably to the other data cubes , which were obtained in the austral winter .",
    "the improved atmospheric conditions make it possible to observe all four of the major co isotopologues ( @xmath8co , @xmath9co , c@xmath10o and c@xmath11o ) , although the c@xmath11o line is very weak and only detectable at a @xmath18 level at best , as measuring it typically requires longer integration times than our fast - mapping survey mode allows ( see paper i ) .",
    "the isotopologue ratios allow examination of the distribution of columns of molecular gas through gmcs @xcite , so that variance in the x@xmath19 factor , used to link the co intensity to the h@xmath20 column density in order to obtain molecular cloud masses , can be determined ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .            in section 2 of this paper ( paper ii )",
    "the data are described , along with the various metrics used to quantify the noise and data quality .",
    "section 3 will present some sample science results , however detailed science investigations are left for focussed studies , such as @xcite , which described a filamentary molecular cloud in the g328 sightline .",
    "the data are being made available at the survey website , and in the csiro - atnf data archive , as they are published .",
    "the data presented in this paper were taken in march 2011 , and over the austral winters of 20112013 .",
    "the observations performed in 2011 ( @xmath21@xmath1 , @xmath22 ) used the unsw digital filter bank ( the unsw  mops ) in its ` zoom ' mode , with @xmath23mhz dual - polarization bands ; in 2012 this was increased to 8 bands , so that the data from @xmath16@xmath24 , @xmath17 and @xmath25@xmath1 , @xmath4@xmath5 cover a larger spectral region . very little emission is observed in these extended bands away from the galactic centre , but it is possible that high velocity clouds could be detected .",
    "the full line parameters are given in table 1 of paper i ; the dr1 dataset has a spectral resolution of @xmath26kms@xmath6 over at least 4096 channels for each of the four co isotopologues .",
    "the angular resolution of the mopra beam at 115ghz is 33arcsec fwhm @xcite ; after the median filter convolution is applied during the data reduction process , the beam size is around 35arcsec in the final data set .",
    "the extended beam efficiency , used to convert brightness temperatures into line fluxes , is @xmath27 at 115ghz ( rather than the main beam efficiency @xmath28 ; * ? ? ?",
    "co ( left ) and @xmath9co data cubes , @xmath29 , as determined from the standard deviation in the continuum channels ( in @xmath30[k ] units ) for each pixel .",
    "the dotted distribution in each is the noise level in the @xmath31324@xmath32 field ( described in paper i ) , highlighting the effect of observing in the summer months.[sigma ] ]         there are a number of metrics used to assess the quality of dr1 .",
    "figure [ sigma ] shows histograms of the noise per channel , @xmath29 , as well as the previously - published distribution from the g323 sightline for both the @xmath8co and @xmath9co lines ( the c@xmath10o and c@xmath11o lines have similar noise characteristics to @xmath9co ) .",
    "these are calculated by finding the standard deviation of the channels outside of the range where line emission occurs , where @xmath33kms@xmath6 and @xmath34kms@xmath6 ( figure [ fig7c - moments ] shows that some emission exists where @xmath34kms@xmath6 , but it occurs in very few pixels and does not affect these statistics ) . although the g323 data were taken in the summer months",
    ", the noise distribution is not significantly different from those data obtained in winter . while the tails of the histograms are @xmath35k higher in the summer observations due to the poorer conditions , the mode values for @xmath8co and @xmath9co are 1.5 and 0.7k per 0.1kms@xmath6 velocity channel , in comparison to 1.3 and 0.5k per 0.1kms@xmath6 channel in winter .",
    "the @xmath8co line has higher noise than the @xmath9co line ( and those of the other isotopologues not shown here ) , as there is a molecular oxygen absorption line near 115ghz , making the atmosphere inherently worse than it is for the other isotopologues at 109112ghz .",
    "figure [ sigma - map ] shows the @xmath36 noise maps for the @xmath8co and @xmath9co data cubes , determined from the standard deviation of the continuum channels between @xmath37 and @xmath38kms@xmath6 in each pixel .",
    "the wider visible striping in these maps is an effect of the scans in the @xmath39 and @xmath40 directions being taken with a variety of different system temperatures and observing conditions .",
    "thinner stripes or spots of lower apparent noise occur where ` bad ' pixels , rows or columns were identified and interpolated over ( the lower noise is a result of interpolating over several nearby pixels ; see paper i ) . as in figure",
    "[ sigma ] , the higher noise occurring in the g323 field is a result of poorer conditions in the summer months .",
    "( in @xmath30 [ k ] units ) for @xmath8co and @xmath9co , in the data for each pixel , determined from the ambient temperature load paddle measurements .",
    "the dotted distribution in each is the @xmath41324@xmath32 field described in paper i ; the higher @xmath42 values highlight the effect of observing in the summer months.[tsys ] ]    the system temperature , @xmath42 , measures the level of the received signal from the source , sky , telescope and instrument .",
    "it is calibrated every 30 minutes with reference to an ambient temperature paddle that is placed in front of the beam .",
    "figure [ tsys ] shows histograms of the probability distribution of @xmath42 for @xmath8co and @xmath9co , alongside their counterparts for the g323 sightline .",
    "again , the @xmath8co line has @xmath42 about a factor of two higher than the values for the other lines due to the inferior conditions .",
    "maps of the system temperature for all four of the co isotopologues are shown in figure [ fig4b - tsys - map ] ; @xmath9co and c@xmath10o share the same @xmath42 map as these lines are in the same 2ghz band of the correlator .",
    "as before , the striping is a result of combining data from scans in both the @xmath39 and @xmath40 directions ( minimizing artefacts from poor sky conditions ) , while spots occur where the data cube has been thresholded to remove that data with excessive @xmath42 values ( see paper i for more details ) .",
    "scans with particularly high @xmath42 values were repeated ( these are also visible in figure [ sigma - map ] as wide stripes of lower noise ) .",
    "several of the data cubes were affected by contamination from faint molecular clouds in the sky reference beam ( of typical intensity @xmath43k in @xmath8co and @xmath44k in @xmath9co ; the other lines are generally too weak for sky emission to be visible ) .",
    "while tests of the sky reference positions were carried out prior to survey observations , these were quick observations and the faint sky signal was typically lost in the noise . in dr1",
    "this contamination has been removed by calculating the average spectra in a region of @xmath45 pixels where the sky contamination is uniform , such that there is no true emission within @xmath46kms@xmath6 of the negative emission profile .",
    "a gaussian template is fit to this contaminating profile and then subtracted from the individual spectrum at each pixel in the full square degree .",
    "the central velocity of the sky emission varies across each square degree , as the reduction process ( see paper i ) does not control for any variation relative to the local standard of rest in the sky spectrum ; this is compensated for by linearly varying the central velocity of the template spectrum in both longitude and latitude ( typically by @xmath47 km s@xmath6 in either direction ) .",
    "table [ tab - sky ] gives the position of the sky reference beam for each square degree , along with the intensity and central velocity of the contamination in the average spectrum for the square degree .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab - dht ]    figures [ fig6-mean_spectra ] and [ fig6-mean_spectra2 ] show the average @xmath8co and @xmath9co line profiles for each square degree cube in dr1 .",
    "the @xmath8co profiles from the lower spatial ( @xmath48 ) and spectral ( 1.3kms@xmath6 ) resolution survey of @xcite are overlaid on the plots , showing that the structure of the profiles match well , although the intensity of the mopra line peaks is @xmath49 times higher than the corresponding @xcite intensities ( see table [ tab - dht ] ) .",
    "the intensity ratio was determined using the average spectra for each square degree over the velocity range @xmath50$]kms@xmath6 where the majority of the emission lies , and has been found to be relatively consistent across dr1 .",
    "@xcite found the average of the mopra extended beam efficiency ( @xmath51 ) had a typical rms deviation of @xmath5210% over their eight observing seasons ( each about a month in duration ) , with much of the variation reflecting changes in the system temperature scale due to instrument modifications .",
    "their beam efficiencies were lower than those used to calculate @xmath53 in this paper ; using these would only increase the ratio of the mopra co fluxes to those of @xcite .",
    "the integrated intensity maps in figures [ fig7-moments][fig7c - moments ] highlight molecular clouds in the mopra @xmath8co and @xmath9co data cubes over each 10kms@xmath6 interval between @xmath54 and @xmath55kms@xmath6 in units of kkms@xmath6 , corrected for the beam efficiency @xmath56 .",
    "these have been calculated using the _ dilated mask _ code developed for the magma survey of the magellanic clouds in co @xcite .",
    "the dilated cprops mask @xcite is calculated by identifying regions of high significance ( @xmath57 ) and expanding these to connected regions of lower significance ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "masking the data in this way reduces the number of high noise artefacts in the intensity images , although some remain . in particular , the upper boundary of the main survey at @xmath0@xmath59 , @xmath60 is clearly visible as a series of high noise points in both the @xmath8co intensity map and the @xmath9co contours .        to aid interpretation of the data , figure [ fig5-rotationcurves ] shows derived relationships between the radial velocity and galactocentric radius ( @xmath61 , left ) and the distance from the sun ( @xmath62 , right ) for the central longitude of each square degree in dr1 .",
    "this is an expansion of fig .",
    "@xmath63 in paper i , now showing the variation across the whole ten degrees . as in that figure ,",
    "the right plot shows the near - far ambiguity for negative velocities between 0kms@xmath6 and the tangent velocity along each sightline ( decreasing with @xmath39 ) . from the intensity maps in figure [ fig7-moments ] , it is clear that a number of molecular clouds occur at ` forbidden ' velocities ( possessing velocities that are not possible under the assumption that the rotation curve holds , i.e.  @xmath64kms@xmath6 ) ; in this analysis any such velocities are assigned to the tangential distance .",
    "clouds with positive velocities have source distances greater than twice the tangent distance .",
    "figure [ fig8-pvplot ] shows a position - velocity slice of the @xmath8co emission averaged over the primary degree of latitude of the dr1 data cube , overlaid with model positions of the spiral arms in a four - arm spiral galaxy .",
    "the parameters of the model galaxy have been taken from @xcite and depict a four - arm spiral galaxy with a pitch angle of @xmath65 , a central bar length of 3kpc and sun - galactic centre distance of 8.0kpc .",
    "while the molecular clouds clearly lie in striped bands across the position - velocity diagram , the exact centre of the spiral arms is harder to determine .",
    "the meta - analysis of @xcite calculated the radius of the spiral arms to be near @xmath66pc from mid - arm to dust lane , which suggests that it is difficult to identify clearly the arm in which individual clouds reside , particularly in regions such as @xmath67@xmath1 , where the norma and scutum - crux arms are close in velocity space .",
    "the distribution of molecular clouds with latitude is illustrated in figure [ fig8b - extrapv ] , which shows the position - velocity distribution of @xmath8co emission vertically averaged over the 6 arcmin surrounding each of @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the differences between these images is striking , showing how discrete the molecular gas is even within the galactic plane .",
    "there is very little co located at the ` forbidden ' velocities indicated by figure [ fig5-rotationcurves ] at @xmath70 , while the fastest negative velocities occur at the higher latitudes .",
    "it is also worth noting that the vertical streaking , caused by high noise residuals in the data , occurs at different longitudes in the three position - velocity diagrams ; these suggest that the methods used to clean high - noise columns work well , although individual pixels with poor baselines may remain .",
    "figure [ masses ] shows the distribution of mass in dr1 , under the assumption that the clouds with negative velocities are located at the near distance ( providing a lower limit on the true molecular mass ) , and that the x - factor used to link the co intensity to the h@xmath20 column density is x@xmath71@xmath72(kkms@xmath6)@xmath6 .",
    "this value is adopted for @xmath73 using figure 11 of @xcite , and while it is larger than their value of x@xmath74@xmath72(kkms@xmath6)@xmath6 for @xmath75 , it is within the uncertainties recommended by @xcite in their meta - analysis of x - factor values from observational and theoretical studies of the milky way .",
    "these simplifications were also adopted in paper i to provide a lower limit on the molecular mass in g323 ; however it was also shown that one of the five features in the spectrum was likely mis - identified as being at the near distance rather than the far distance .",
    "this leads to an underestimate of the total mass of about one quarter , which is within the uncertainty of using a constant x - factor mass calibration .    the mass distribution in figure [ masses ] , while coarse , shows how the lower mass limit for each square degree varies over these @xmath76 in longitude .",
    "the contributions to the total mass per degree from clouds at positive ( far distances ) and negative ( nearer ) velocities can be related to features in the position - velocity diagram in figure [ fig8-pvplot ] .",
    "in particular , the lines of sight through @xmath77@xmath78 possess a large component of mass at positive velocities , arising from the clouds at @xmath79kms@xmath6 from the far sagittarius - carina arm ( see figure [ fig7c - moments ] ) , while the increase at @xmath80 is due to a large cloud at @xmath81$]kms@xmath6 , which can not be associated with a single spiral arm using only the co emission . the mass increases from a minimum at @xmath82 of @xmath83m@xmath84 to a maximum at @xmath85 of @xmath86m@xmath84 , with a total of @xmath87m@xmath84 within the @xmath76 main survey span , where @xmath88 .",
    "of this , approximately 15% is situated beyond the solar circle .",
    "co emission per square degree using x@xmath71@xmath72(kkms@xmath6)@xmath6 ( see text ) .",
    "the dotted line is the mass contribution from molecular clouds at negative velocities ( assumed to be at the near distance ) , the dashed line that from positive velocities ( sited beyond the solar circle ) , and the solid line is the total ( all in units of solar mass).[masses ] ]      the principal intention of this paper is to describe the co data cubes that make up dr1 .",
    "these may be used for a variety of applications , as they provide the distribution of the molecular gas along a substantive portion of the fourth quadrant of the galaxy , as well as its dynamical motions . from this ,",
    "column densities , optical depths and the three dimensional molecular mass distribution can be inferred , such as were outlined above .",
    "comparison with infrared to millimetre - wave continuum images , for instance , would allow star formation efficiencies to be determined , and the variation of the x@xmath19 conversion factor between co flux and h@xmath20 column density to be examined on a galactic scale .",
    "three sample science investigations that have been undertaken using the mopra co survey data are illustrated here .",
    "the first compares the co emission in the g328 region with that of [ ci ] 809ghz ( from the heat telescope in antarctica ) and hi 21 cm ( from the southern galactic plane survey ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) emission , discovering a cold , filamentary molecular cloud nearly @xmath89 in length but only @xmath90 across @xcite .",
    "the emission was confined to a narrow ( 2kms@xmath6 fwhm ) velocity range , with the hydrogen seen in self - absorption ( i.e.   hisa ) , apparently enveloping the molecular gas .",
    "the authors hypothesised that the formation of a molecular cloud was being witnessed , with the molecular material possibly condensing out of the atomic substrate .",
    "further analysis of the entire data cube , not just the narrow velocity range associated with this filament , is now being undertaken to investigate the variation of the [ ci ] to co ratio , and to search for evidence of ` dark ' molecular gas .",
    "this is molecular gas where its normal tracer ( co ) is weak , or absent ( i.e.  h@xmath20 without co ) , so that the molecular gas has not been detected , or at least the amount has been under - estimated",
    ". however if co is absent ( presumably due to photodissociation by far  uv photons ) , the carbon will be present as either c or c@xmath12 .",
    "these species emit in the thz spectral regime , where the heat telescope operates .",
    "analysis of the complete data set ( burton et al . 2015 , in preparation ) indicates that at the edges of the molecular clouds there is a tendency for the [ ci]/co ratio to rise , as the co itself falls , consistent with the existence of dark molecular gas .",
    "the second example relates the mopra co data to x - ray emission .",
    "a bright x - ray flare was observed from the binary star circinus x1 in late 2013 by three spacecraft ( _ swift , chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ ) . over a three month period four",
    "well - defined rings were seen in the x - rays , extending outwards with time to a distance of @xmath91 from the central source .",
    "this is in the g322 portion of our co survey .",
    "comparison of the mopra data with the images from the x - ray satellites showed that each of the x - ray peaks in the rings is correlated with corresponding emission in the molecular gas .",
    "however , each has a different velocity , ranging from @xmath92 to @xmath93kms@xmath6 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the x - rays are being scattered off clumps of dust associated with the molecular gas to produce the light echoes . using the distances to these clumps inferred from the galactic rotation curve , and the scattering geometry a direct kinematic distance",
    "could be determined for the source .",
    "this was found to be 9.4kpc , significantly greater than the previously estimated 4kpc .",
    "it implies that circinus x1 is a frequent super - eddington source , producing a narrow jet with a collimation angle of @xmath94 and a lorentz beaming factor of @xmath95 .",
    "the final example relates the mopra co data to an unidentified radio continuum source known as pmn 1452 - 5910 , thought possibly to be related to an snr evident at 843mhz from most data @xcite , as analysed by @xcite .",
    "three features are apparent in the mopra co spectrum towards this source , at @xmath96 and @xmath97kms@xmath6 .",
    "their morphology , however , in comparison to that of the radio continuum , suggests that it is the @xmath97kms@xmath6 co feature that is associated with the radio , so providing a distance to the source .",
    "this also identifies the source with an h@xmath20o maser at a similar velocity , and enables an interpretation of infrared images from the spitzer telescope to be made .",
    "jones & braiding concluded that the source is a previously - unidentified massive star forming region about 13kpc away .",
    "they then determine parameters for the region : @xmath98m@xmath84 of molecular gas with an average column of @xmath99@xmath72 , enclosing several uchii regions with emission measures @xmath100pc@xmath101 and electron densities @xmath102@xmath103 .",
    "three ob stars ( 2 of type b0 , 1 of o8 ) can account for the radio emission .",
    "in their forthcoming annual review of molecular clouds in the milky way , @xcite state : `` for further progress in [ molecular cloud census studies ] , surveys comparable to the galactic ring survey @xcite in resolution and sensitivity in the fourth quadrant are required . ''",
    "the first @xmath76 of such a survey have been presented here .",
    "the cherenkov telescope array will produce a new survey of the high energy gamma - ray sources in the galactic plane @xcite at a resolution approaching 1 arcminute @xcite .",
    "high resolution molecular gas surveys such as this will be required to properly identify these sources amongst the diffuse tev gamma - ray emission components cta will likely detect ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the mopra co survey of the southern galactic plane aims to address these community needs by observing the entirety of the fourth quadrant along the plane from @xmath104@xmath14 where @xmath105 , at a spatial resolution of 35 arcsec and a spectral resolution of 0.1kms@xmath6 , in the @xmath70 lines of @xmath8co , @xmath9co , c@xmath10o and c@xmath11o .",
    "this is a significant improvement over previous studies conducted of the fourth quadrant of the galaxy .",
    "data release 1 from the mopra co survey covers the 11.5 square degrees from @xmath16@xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3@xmath1 , @xmath4@xmath5 .",
    "included in this paper are a number of metrics describing the quality of the dataset , which has a typical rms noise of @xmath106k in the @xmath8co frequency band and @xmath107k in the other isotopologue frequency bands , and a discussion of the improvement in the data taken during the winter months compared to the initial square degree observed in summer that was published in paper i. the line intensities in the mopra co survey are @xmath108 times those of the @xcite survey , and our higher resolution co line profiles match those of their survey quite well .",
    "sample line profiles for each square degree are presented , as well as integrated intensity maps that show the filamentary nature and complexity of the molecular clouds in the survey .",
    "the primary @xmath109 strip of the galactic plane in dr1 has been found to contain @xmath87m@xmath84 of molecular gas .",
    "the mopra co survey is ongoing , with the intention of covering the entirety of the fourth quadrant of the galactic plane by the end of 2015 . the data are being made available at the survey website , and in the csiro - atnf data archive , as they are published .",
    "the mopra radio telescope is currently part of the australia telescope national facility .",
    "operations support was provided by the university of new south wales and the university of adelaide .",
    "many staff of the atnf have contributed to the success of the remote operations at mopra .",
