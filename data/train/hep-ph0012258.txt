    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle interactions contains one cp violating parameter , which is a complex phase in the quark sector of the sm .",
    "this phase appearing in the quark mixing matrix of the charged current is expected to account for the observed cp violations in the @xmath4-@xmath5 mixing , in the @xmath4 decays , as well as in the potential cp violation in the @xmath6-@xmath7 system .",
    "however , it is generally believed that new physics beyond the sm must exists .",
    "one of the major motivations for this is to understand the seemingly unnaturalness of the higgs mass at the electroweak scale in the sm , the so - called gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "in addition , due to the difficulties of the sm to account for the baryon asymmetry of the universe as well as to resolve the strong cp problem , it is widely accepted that new sources of cp violation are needed .",
    "the most popular extension of the sm that addresses the hierarchy problem is the supersymmetric standard model@xcite .",
    "the extension has many more new ( super-)particles and parameters compared to the sm . with all these new parameters , there are many possible new sources for cp violation .",
    "the phenomenology of cp violation caused by these new sources is rich and diverse .",
    "the effect of these new sources of cp violation may surface in the data before any super - particle is discovered .    even in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , which only augments superpartners of known particles in sm ,",
    "the higgs sector contains new sources of cp violation in its couplings to super - particles .",
    "when the @xmath8 term in the higgs superpotential and the soft - susy - breaking @xmath9 terms are complex , the tri - boson - couplings between the higgs bosons and the squarks can contain cp violation .",
    "in mssm with the simplest universal soft supersymmetry breaking@xcite , there are two new cp violating couplings which can be defined to be the phases of @xmath8 and @xmath9 terms in a convention that makes the others new couplings real .",
    "therefore , these new sources of cp violation are generic of any supersymmetric theories .",
    "in addition , they also have been used as one of the leading sources of cp violation in a scheme to use mssm to generate baryon number asymmetry of the universe in electroweak phase transition @xcite .",
    "therefore , it should be important to look for collider phenomenology that can check these mechanism .",
    "for example , these complex couplings lead to a complex phase in the mixing@xcite of stop states .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to investigate one consequence of this cp violating source in colliders .",
    "it is expected that the future colliders are able to produce cp violation signals@xcite in the sectors of heavy particles . in this article",
    "we study the cp asymmetry in the higgs decay into top pairs because the large top or stop coupling to the higgs particles can produce largest effect .    in mssm ,",
    "even with soft breaking terms and @xmath10 symmetry breaking terms , there is no tree level mixing between the scalar and the pseudoscalar bosons .",
    "therefore their couplings can be discussed separately",
    ". however , the scalar and the pseudoscalar bosons mix at one loop , and their effect has to be taken into account as we will show later .",
    "the source of cp violation that we investigate here is due to the mixing in the stop mass matrix .",

    "note that the nonvanishing of @xmath40 or @xmath41 is a sure sign of cp violation already ( similar to @xmath42 ) .",
    "however , if for some reason @xmath8 and @xmath43 happen to have the same phase , @xmath40 and @xmath41 will vanish because in this very special case the phase in the stop mass matrix and that in the pseudoscalar couplings can be removed simultaneously .",
    "the pseudoscalar higgs coupling to the top quark is given by the following lagrangian , @xmath44    the neutral scalar higgs sector is made up two scalar eigenstates , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
