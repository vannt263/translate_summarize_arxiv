    "semileptonic decays of the @xmath6 lepton into @xmath7 and @xmath8 final states provide a powerful probe of the strange sector of the weak charged current . recently",

    "e.g. _ by analyzing the invariant mass distribution and in particular angular distributions of the hadronic system as described below .",
    "in this paper we will discuss the scalar form factor in these @xmath6 decay modes .",
    "the hadronic matrix elements can be parametrized in terms of two form factors , the vector form factor @xmath9 and the scalar form factor @xmath10 .",
    "both decay modes are expected to be dominated by the @xmath2 vector resonance @xmath11 , and in fact in our previous paper @xcite we neglected the scalar form factor . a scalar resonance ( @xmath12 ) , however , can enhance the scalar form factor .",
    "a good candidate is the @xmath1 , and indeed there might be experimental evidence for an enhancement in the @xmath5 invariant mass spectrum around @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the situation , however , is more complicated in two ways .",
    "firstly , in this energy range , there is also a vector resonance @xmath3 .",
    "secondly , off - shell the @xmath2 can have a scalar component , which contributes to the scalar form factor .",
    "vector and scalar contributions can be disentangled experimentally in a model independent way by studying suitable angular distributions of the @xmath5 system @xcite . the relevant information in encoded in four structure functions .",
    "three of these structure functions ( @xmath14 ) can be measured even if the @xmath6 rest frame can not be reconstructed .",
    "of particular importance are the structure functions @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which arise from a nonvanishing spin - zero part of the hadronic matrix element .",
    "@xmath15 is essentially the spin - zero spectral function whereas @xmath16 arises from the interference of the spin - one part and the spin - zero part of the hadronic matrix element .",
    "we will show that a measurement of these structure functions allows to establish the @xmath1 contribution in a model independent way and might also yield interesting information about the off - shell behaviour of the @xmath17 propagator .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .  2",
    ", we discuss the general structure of the matrix element in terms of the vector and the scalar form factors .",
    "we discuss predictions from chiral perturbation theory for the low energy limit of the form factors and derive a model for the form factors based on a meson dominance model .",
    "the parameters of the model are then fixed by matching it to the chiral perturbation theory limit . in sec .  3",
    ", we define the structure functions , which determine the angular distributions and the decay rate . numerical results and our conclusions",

    "+ let us add two brief comments regarding the closely related decay modes @xmath50 and @xmath51 . first , the corresponding scalar form factors in these decay modes vanish in the isospin symmetry limit , because in this limit the vector current is exactly conserved ( cvc )",

    "such a violation could be tested by measuring the structure functions @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( see below ) .",

    "any nonvanishing contribution to @xmath15 or @xmath16 would be a clear signal of cvc violation .",

    "regarding @xmath15 , we find in fig .",
    "2a that the interference of the @xmath83 with the @xmath17 off - shell scalar projection from the propagator in eq .",
    "( [ eqnprop ] ) shifts the @xmath83 resonance peak to slightly smaller @xmath66 values .",
    "this effect appears to be probably too small to be established experimentally .",
    "another effect , however , of the scalar part of the @xmath17 off - shell propagator is the dip close to the @xmath17 resonance @xmath197 .",
    "an experimental confirmation of this dip would support the use of eq .",
    "( [ eqnprop ] ) for the @xmath17 propagator .",
    "of course , @xmath15 is very small in this mass region , and so only future high statistics experiment ( b or tau - charm factories ) could be sensitive enough to study this effect .",
    "as far as @xmath16 is concerned , there is some sensitivity to the choice of the off - shell propagator ( compare the solid and the dotted - dashed curve ) .",
    "however , there is no qualitative difference , and in view of the uncertainty in the precise value of @xmath76 , it does not seem to be possible to decide between the two forms of the @xmath17 propagator from @xmath16 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we display results for the three structure functions @xmath198 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , normalized to @xmath189 .",
    "we give results both with ( fig .",
    "3a , b ) and without ( fig .",
    "3c , d ) the @xmath83 and with ( a , c ) and without ( b , d ) the @xmath74 contributions .",
    "comparing figs .",
    "3a , b and fig .",
    "3c , d we find that the scalar resonance leads to a strong enhancement of @xmath199 above @xmath200 as expected from fig .",
    "2a . the large negative value for the ratio of @xmath201 in the range @xmath202 gev@xmath192 is also an effect of the @xmath83 scalar resonance .",
    "comparing the results in ( a , c ) and ( b , d ) , we find that the value of @xmath73 does not change the overall shapes of the @xmath203 very much .",
    "note that the nonvanishing contribution to @xmath199 and @xmath201 in fig .",
    "3c , d is entirely due to the interference of the scalar contribution from the off - shell @xmath17 with the vector part .",
    "the effect of the off - shell @xmath17 in the results shown in fig .",
    "3a , b is small .    finally , we present the @xmath66 distribution for the ratio of @xmath204 in fig .  4 .",
    "remember that @xmath195 measures the imaginary part of the form factors ( @xmath205 ) and requires nontrivial phases of the amplitudes .",
    "these strong interaction phases are essential for an observation of possible cp violation effects in the difference of @xmath195 for the @xmath206 and the @xmath207 decay @xcite .",
    "note however , that @xmath195 can only be measured in experiments where the @xmath6 direction in the laboratory frame can be determined as explained in sec .",
    "we have presented a meson dominance model for the the decay @xmath208 , which includes the vector resonances @xmath2 , @xmath3 and the scalar @xmath1 .",
    "we have estimated the size of the @xmath83 contribution by matching our model to the one loop prediction of chiral perturbation theory , which determines the amplitude at very small momentum transfers .    based on our model , we have calculated the vector and the scalar form factors , which determine the hadronic matrix element .",
    "the scalar form factor receives contributions both from the @xmath83 and from the off - shell spin-0 projection of the @xmath17 .",
    "we have presented predictions for the kaon - pion invariant mass spectrum . although some indication for or against a sizable @xmath83 contribution can be found in this spectrum , a clear disentanglement of the @xmath3 and the @xmath1 contributions is possible only by analyzing the hadronic structure functions .",
    "both @xmath15 , the purely scalar structure function , and @xmath16 , which measures vector - scalar interference , are interesting in this respect .",
    "a measurement of @xmath209 allows for a clear establishment of the @xmath83 contribution , while @xmath210 yields additional information about the scalar part , in particular its relative sign .",
    "we also studied the issue of the off - shell @xmath17 propagator .",
    "we used a propagator for massive vector mesons with a spin-0 component in the off - shell region , rather than a strictly transverse propagator .",
    "matching of the vector meson dominance model to chiral perturbation theory only works if this scalar component is included in the vector meson propagator .",
    "experimentally , this scalar component could best be studied by measuring @xmath209 close to the @xmath2 mass .",
    "an explicit experimental confirmation , however , is difficult and will require very high statistics .",
