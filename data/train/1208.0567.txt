    "due to its lattice structure and position of the fermi energy , the low energy electronic excitations of graphene are described by an effective field theory that is lorentz invariant  @xcite .",
    "unlike galilean invariant theories such as fermi liquids  @xcite whose main relevant parameter is the effective mass , lorentz invariant theories are characterized by an effective velocity . because of this , an increase of electron - electron interactions induces an increase of the fermi velocity , @xmath0 , in contrast to fermi liquids , where the opposite trend is true  @xcite . in the case of graphene ,",
    "when electron - electron interactions are weak  @xcite , @xmath0 is expected to be as low as 0.85@xmath210@xmath3  m / s , whereas , for the case of strong interactions  @xcite , @xmath0 is expected to be as high as 1.73@xmath210@xmath3  m / s .",
    "recently , fermi velocities as high as @xmath43@xmath210@xmath3  m / s  @xcite have been achieved in suspended graphene through a change of the carrier concentration @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "however , because this dependence is logarithmic , @xmath5 needs to be changed by two orders of magnitude in order to change the velocity by a factor of 3 .",
    "this implies that it is unpractical to use @xmath5 as a way to engineer @xmath0 , let alone the fact that one should first realize suspended graphene in the device  @xcite .",
    "several other routes have also been proposed to engineer @xmath0 in graphene via the electron - electron interaction , including modifications of : a ) curvature of the graphene sheet  @xcite ; b ) periodic potentials  @xcite ; c ) dielectric screening  @xcite .",
    "while the former two also substantially modify the starting material , the latter simply modifies the effective dielectric constant , @xmath6 , making it more appealing for device applications  @xcite . despite this advantage , no systematic study of how to engineer @xmath7 by changing @xmath6 exists to date .",
    "here we provide a new venue to control the fermi velocity of graphene using dielectrics , while keeping @xmath5 constant .",
    "we perform such a study using three single - layer graphene samples , which were prepared by chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) on cu , followed by an _ in situ _ dewetting of cu on quartz ( single crystal sio@xmath8 )  @xcite or a transfer onto hexagonal boron nitride ( bn )  @xcite , and by epitaxial growth on 4@xmath9-sic(000@xmath10 )  @xcite .",
    "figures  1_a _ and  1_b _ show angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) intensity maps measured near the brillouin zone ( bz ) corner k along the @xmath11-k direction for the two cvd grown samples , which constitute the first report on dirac quasiparticle mapping from these samples . following the maximum intensity",
    ", one can clearly observe almost linear energy spectra , characteristic of dirac electrons  @xcite .",
    "the momentum distribution curves ( mdc ) , intensity spectra taken at constant energy as a function of momentum , are shown in fig .",
    "1_c_. in addition to being proportional to the imaginary part of the electron self - energy , the mdc spectral width provides information on the sample quality . a clear increase of the width is observed by changing the substrate from sic(000@xmath10 ) via bn to quartz , a trend that is in overall agreement with the theoretical expectation that the electron self - energy should vary with the inverse square of the dielectric screening  @xcite , as later discussed .",
    "the quartz sample here used constitutes a substantial improvement over a previous experiment  @xcite on a similar substrate ( compare 0.19  @xmath12 ( red line ) versus @xmath40.7  @xmath12 ( gray - dashed line ) ) .",
    "the much improved data quality allows for a detailed self - energy analysis and consequent extraction of important parameters such as @xmath0 .     for graphene on sic(000@xmath10 )",

    ", we show the energy vs. momentum dispersions for graphene on three different substrates , sic(000@xmath10 ) , bn , and quartz , obtained by fitting the mdc spectra . the observed dispersions exhibit two distinctive features .",
    "first , the measured dispersions deviate from linearity with an increased slope around @xmath130.5 ev for all the samples ( compare experimental data to dashed gray lines in fig .",
    "2_a _ ) . as the substrate is changed from sic(000@xmath10 ) via bn to quartz , corresponding to a decrease of the dielectric screening , the departure from linearity at high energy becomes more pronounced .",
    "second , the direct comparison between experimental dispersions and _ ab initio _ calculations for the two extreme cases @xmath14  1  @xcite ( suspended graphene ) and @xmath15  @xcite shows another substrate - dependence ( fig .  2_b _ ) . upon changing the substrate",
    ", the slope increases approaching the dispersion for @xmath14  1 . the deviation from linearity and the enhancement of the slope result in a reshape of the typical conical dispersion , in a similar fashion as reported for other charge - neutral graphene samples  @xcite ( see cartoons in the inset of fig .",
    "2_a _ : from left to right ) .",
    "we note that the largest upturn for graphene / quartz can not be explained by : a ) resolution , which typically results in the deflection of mdc peaks near @xmath16 to lower momentum , and would involve a much smaller effect by an order of magnitude ( @xmath17a few tens mev )  @xcite ; b ) the presence of other bands with a different azimuthal orientation , which would cause instead an abrupt increase and a significant asymmetry of the mdc width at the upturn energy .    ) ( blue line ) , bn ( dark - yellow line ) , and quartz ( red line ) .",
    "the gray - dashed lines are guides to the eyes .",
    "the insets are cartoons for the electron band structure of graphene with weak ( left ) and strong ( right ) electron - electron interactions .",

    "to quantify the effect of dielectric substrates on the electron - electron interactions and @xmath0 , we adopt the standard self - energy analysis to extract self - consistently the strength of the electron - electron interactions and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "figure  3_a _ shows the difference between measured dispersions , @xmath19 ( from fig .",
    "2_a _ ) , and the theoretical dispersion for @xmath15 , @xmath20 ( shown in fig .",
    "assuming that electron - electron interactions are effectively screened for @xmath15 , the @xmath21 curve can be considered a good measurement of the difference between the self - energy and its value at @xmath16 . to fit these curves",
    ", we use the marginal fermi liquid self - energy function as previously reported  @xcite with an analytic form of @xmath22 ( dotted lines in fig .",
    "3_a _ ) . here",
    ", @xmath23 is a dimensionless fine - structure constant ( or the strength of electron - electron interactions ) defined as @xmath24  @xcite , @xmath25 the fermi velocity for @xmath15 , 0.85@xmath210@xmath26  m / s  @xcite , @xmath27 the momentum cut - off , 1.7  @xmath12 , and @xmath28 the fermi wave number .",
    "an overall good agreement with the experimental data is observed allowing to extract important parameters such as @xmath6 and @xmath23 for graphene on each substrate .",
    "for graphene on sic(000@xmath10 ) and bn , we obtain @xmath14  7.26@xmath290.02 ( @xmath30  0.35 ) and @xmath14  4.22@xmath290.01 ( @xmath30  0.61 ) , respectively . the extracted value for graphene on bn is in agreement with the standard approximation @xmath31  4.02 and 3.05 , where @xmath32  1 and @xmath33  7.04 ( for out - of - plane polarization ) and 5.09 ( for in - plane polarization ) in the low frequency limit ( static dielectric constant ) for hexagonal - bn  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the obtained value for graphene on sic(000@xmath10 ) is close to a previous report  @xcite .",
    "the apparent discrepancy with the latter ( compare @xmath14  7.26@xmath290.02 in this work with 6.4@xmath290.1 in reference  @xcite ) is due to the different choice of reference band ( or so - called bare band ) .",
    "specifically , in this work , @xmath34 is used as the bare band , whereas , in reference  @xcite , the bare band is approximated by a straight line . finally , for graphene / quartz",
    ", we obtain @xmath14  1.80@xmath290.02 ( @xmath30  1.43 ) , which is smaller than the expected value of @xmath14  2.45  @xcite , instead closer to the experimentally extracted value for suspended graphene ( @xmath42.2 )  @xcite .",
    "this observation , together with the similar energy - momentum dispersion relation at high binding energy to the theoretical one for suspended graphene ( fig .",
    "2_b _ ) , point to a very weak effect of the substrate .",
    "this is likely a consequence of the different sample preparation method adopted here ( see materials and methods section ) .        in fig .",
    "3_b _ , we show the measured @xmath0 as a function of the extracted @xmath6 ( see also table  1 ) .",
    "results from a suspended sample  @xcite and another graphene / sio@xmath8 sample  @xcite are also plotted for comparison . upon decreasing @xmath6 from @xmath35 to 7.26 and 4.22 ,",
    "@xmath0 is enhanced from its lda limit of 0.85@xmath210@xmath26  m / s ( cyan triangle in fig .",
    "3_b _ ) to 1.15@xmath290.02@xmath210@xmath26  m / s ( blue circle in fig .",
    "3_b _ ) and 1.49@xmath290.08@xmath210@xmath26  m / s ( dark - yellow circle in fig .",
    "3_b _ ) , by 35  % and 75  % , respectively .",
    "surprisingly , when @xmath6 is further decreased to 1.80 , a dramatic enhancement of @xmath0 up to 2.49@xmath290.30@xmath210@xmath26  m / s ( red circle in fig .",
    "3_b _ ) is observed .",
    "such enhancement corresponds to a 190  % increase from its bare value and represents the highest value reported for graphene on any substrate  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this velocity is comparable to the value measured for suspended graphene ( green square in fig .",
    "3_b _ )  @xcite .",
    "clearly , a @xmath36 dependence of @xmath0 is observed ( dashed line in fig .",
    "3_b _ ) in agreement with the theoretical prediction  @xcite .",
    "our result constitutes the first observation of a power law dependence of the fermi velocity on the dielectric constant at fixed @xmath5 .",
    "this power law dependence allows one to achieve , by a smart choice of dielectric , a high value of @xmath0 that can not be attained otherwise by changing @xmath5  @xcite .",
    ".fermi velocity ( @xmath0 ) , dielectric constant ( @xmath6 ) , and fine structure constant ( @xmath23 ) of graphene on each substrate [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we note that cvd graphene on quartz ( red circle in fig .",
    "3_b _ ) exhibits higher @xmath0 than exfoliated graphene on amorphous sio@xmath8 ( gray square in fig .",
    "3_b _ ) with the same stoichiometry as quartz .",
    "this is a consequence of different sample preparation process and is due to the larger presence of impurities in the exfoliated sample , as suggested by the extremely broad spectra ( see gray dashed line in fig .",
    "therefore , although , in theory , one should expect smaller @xmath0 due to screened electron - electron interactions from impurity  @xcite , one should be cautious in extracting meaningful parameters from these data .",
    "we also note that _ ab initio gw _",
    "calculations  @xcite ( magenta triangle in fig .",
    "3_b _ ) underestimate @xmath0 of suspended graphene",
    ". this may be due to the finite @xmath37-point sampling inherent in such calculations , or it could also be an indication of the need to add higher - order terms in the self - energy calculation by the _ gw_-approximation .    in fig .",
    "3_c _ , we plot the ratio between @xmath0 and @xmath38 , the expected fermi velocity in the fully screened case ( @xmath15 ) , as a function of @xmath23 . as the strength of electron - electron interactions",
    "is increased , @xmath0 is also enhanced .",
    "this is in striking difference with the standard fermi liquid picture , where @xmath0 is expected to decrease with increasing @xmath23  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the observed behavior is consistent with previous theoretical studies for graphene in the case of specific electron - electron interactions  @xcite ( dashed line in fig .",
    "3_c _ ) exhibiting the characteristic self - energy spectrum analogous to a marginal fermi liquid  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the departure from the fermi liquid picture becomes more important with increasing electron - electron interactions or decreasing dielectric screening ( see the relation between @xmath23 and @xmath6 in the inset of fig .",
    "additionally , the observation of @xmath23 values close to 1 ( neither @xmath39  1 nor @xmath40  1 ) for graphene / quartz may indicate that a full theoretical treatment beyond the random - phase approximation  @xcite may be required to understand this sample and/or suspended graphene  @xcite .    the very good agreement with theoretical predictions  @xcite for both @xmath0 versus @xmath6 ( fig .",
    "3_b _ ) and @xmath0 versus @xmath23 ( fig .",
    "3_c _ ) confirms that the dielectric constants obtained by the self - energy analysis are self - consistent .",
    "finally the experimentally determined @xmath6 can largely account for the relatively broad mdcs observed for graphene on quartz ( fig .",
    "1_c _ ) , as compared to graphene on bn and sic(000@xmath10 ) . for @xmath6 values of 1.80 , 4.22 , and 7.26 , for graphene on quartz , bn , and sic(000@xmath10 )",
    "respectively , the mdc widths , expected to vary with the inverse square of the dielectric screening  @xcite , should be roughly 16 and 5 times broader for graphene on quartz and bn than graphene on sic(000@xmath10 ) , in line with the experimental observation ( see , for example , fig .",
    "we stress that , contrary to a fermi liquid system , the broader mdc spectra observed for graphene / quartz do not necessarily imply decreased transport properties . on the contrary ,",
    "the enhanced @xmath23 , the primary cause of the broad spectra , give rise to an enhancement of fermi velocity , which is ultimately one of the most important parameters for device applications .    in conclusion",
    ", we have unveiled the crucial role of dielectric screening in graphene to control both fermi velocity and electron - electron interactions .",
    "additionally , we have shown that graphene , in its charge neutral state , departs from a standard fermi liquid not only in its logarithmic energy spectrum as previously discussed  @xcite , but also in the way that @xmath0 is modulated by the strength of electron - electron interactions .",
    "this dependence provides an alternative way to engineer fermi velocity for graphene on a substrate by modifying the dielectric substrate .",
    "this approach can also be applied to charge - doped graphene and other two - dimensional electron systems such as topological insulators  @xcite that can be grown or transferred to dielectric substrates .",
    "the arpes measurements and sample growth were supported by the director , office of science , office of basic energy sciences , materials sciences and engineering division , of the u.s .",
    "department of energy under contract no .",

    "graphene samples were prepared in three different ways : epitaxial growth on the surface of a 4@xmath9-sic(000@xmath10 ) substrate ; chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) growth on a cu film followed by a transfer onto the surface of boron nitride  @xcite ; and cvd growth followed by _ in situ _ dewetting of cu layer in between graphene and a single crystal sio@xmath8 ( namely quartz which is different from amorphous sio@xmath8 on an si substrate , the widely used substrate for exfoliated graphene  @xcite ) substrate  @xcite .",
    "the later procedure is clearly different from the standard method of exfoliating graphite followed by deposition onto the amorphous sio@xmath8 layer  @xcite .",
    "this results in a reduced effect of the substrate that is suggested by the enhanced height variation with respect to the substrate compared to the sample prepared by the exfoliation and deposition  @xcite .",
    "the resulting graphene is more decoupled from the substrate as supported by several features such as fermi velocity , dielectric constant , and the electron band at higher energies closer to suspended sample .    in order to remove any residue including cu and pmma , a precursor to grow cvd graphene and a polymer to transfer graphene , respectively , we heated the sample to 1000  @xmath41c in ultra - high vacuum .",
    "the removal of cu is confirmed by : ( a ) optical microscopy showing a cleaner image without residual cu once the sample has been heated ; ( b ) absence of related cu features in the arpes spectra such as 3@xmath42 electrons at 3.0  ev and 3.5  ev below fermi energy , and 4@xmath43 free - electron - like state with a band minimum at 0.25  ev below fermi energy  @xcite .",
