    "the advent of an era where two relativistic heavy ion physics colliders are running simultaneously at the lhc and at rhic is upon us .",
    "the rhic program has moved from its initial discovery phase into making detailed measurements to further understand the strongly - interacting quark - gluon plasma formed in @xmath2 collisions .",
    "the lhc heavy ion program provides an opportunity to perform complementary measurements at higher collision energy and to study the plasma with a different temperature and lifetime .",
    "together rhic and the lhc will be a focused , two - pronged attack on understanding qcd matter in extreme conditions .",
    "the rhic program has brought new insights on aspects of the entire collision evolution from the initial state parton distribution functions of the nuclei , through thermalization of the fireball , and the subsequent hadronization of the medium .",
    "questions about the role of saturation physics came to light with the first measurements of charged particle multiplicity@xcite .",
    "the large value of the measured elliptic flow , @xmath3 , for all particles up to and including heavy flavor mesons together with hydrodynamical calculations indicate that the matter produced is strongly interacting with a low shear viscosity - to - entropy density ratio , a perfect fluid , instead of a dilute gas of partons@xcite .",
    "@xmath4 suppression was observed at rhic .",
    "but the quantitatively similar suppression of sps and rhic data suggests that additional physics , such as recombination , which enhance the @xmath4 signal at rhic is required@xcite .",
    "jet quenching was discovered as a suppression of high-@xmath0 hadrons@xcite and confirmed by the away - side suppression from two - particle azimuthal correlations@xcite .",
    "novel structures , such as the `` shoulder''@xcite and the `` ridge''@xcite have been measured in heavy ion collisions . even with this large amount of data on jet energy loss and its effect on the medium , the exact nature of energy loss is poorly understood .",
    "single particle measurements ( @xmath5 ) are apparently insensitive to details of energy loss@xcite as are two - particle correlations , being predominatly due to punch - through and tangential emission@xcite .",
    "view of the different subdetectors of the atlas , all subdetectors cover the full 2@xmath6 in azimuth .",
    "tracking and muon detection extends to @xmath72.5 .",
    "both the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters cover @xmath7 5 and are longitudinally segmented with the typical @xmath8x@xmath9 segmentation indicated . ]    measurements at the lhc should elucidate these issues that are currently not well understood at rhic .",
    "`` day-1 '' measurements such as the charged particle multiplicity will provide key constraints to saturation physics . measurements of the collective flow of particles are crucial to determine if a perfect fluid state exists at the lhc .",
    "quarkonia measurements , both bottomonium and charmonium , will give more detailed insight on the effects contributing to quarkonium suppression .",
    "full jet reconstruction will reduce biases from energy loss , since the energy should be radiated predominantly close to the jet direction@xcite and be reconstructed with the jet energy .",
    "the atlas prospects of global physics measurements@xcite and quarkonia@xcite capabilites are detailed elsewhere in these proceedings .",
    "the focus of this contribution is on measurements of jets and photons , those that will utilize the strenghts of the atlas detector , in order to understand the details of energy loss of hard scattered partons in the medium .",
    "the atlas detector@xcite is poised to make important contributions to the lhc heavy ion program in the coming @xmath10 runs .",
    "although designed for high-@xmath11 measurements of @xmath1 collisions at 14 tev , the detector has been shown to be well suited to perform heavy ion measurements even at the extreme edge of currently predicted particle multiplicities ( @xmath12)@xcite . the atlas detector consists of inner tracking chambers followed by electromagnetic then hadronic calorimetery and finally a muon spectrometer .",
    "the atlas detector covers the full @xmath13 in azimuth and fig .",
    "[ fig : atlasacceptance ] shows the @xmath14 acceptance .",
    "the unique feature of the atlas detector is its calorimetry .",
    "it is both electromagnetic and hadronic and covers 10 units of @xmath14 , unprecedented coverage for relativistic heavy ion experiments .",
    "the notable feature of the calorimeter is its longitudinal segmentation with varying @xmath8x@xmath9 segment sizes indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : atlasacceptance ] . of particular importance is the first longitudinal electromagnetic segment .",
    "it is composed of strips in @xmath14 with a typical width of 0.003 units in @xmath14 and extends to @xmath15 2.5 units .",
    "it was designed to measure @xmath16 events and to reject di - jet events .",
    "the importance of this layer for photon measurements is discussed in section  [ sec : photons ] .",
    "jet performance in heavy ion events has been studied for two complementary jet reconstruction algorithms , the seeded cone algorithm and the fast-@xmath17 algorithm@xcite .",
    "these algorithms perform jet reconstruction on 0.1x0.1 @xmath8x@xmath9 towers built from energy sums of the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters . for the seeded cone algorithm ,",
    "the segment- and @xmath14-dependent @xmath18 is subtracted prior to jet reconstruction . for the fast-@xmath17 algorithm jet reconstruction",
    "is performed directly on the full energy calorimeter towers .",
    "a set of discriminant variables is used to distinguish real jets from background jets composed of underlying event energy .",
    "after discrimination , the background jets are used to determine the background energy to be subtracted from the real jets .",

    "@xmath28 is the longitudinal momentum fraction of a fragment with respect to the jet and @xmath27 is the transverse momentum of a fragment with respect to the jet .",

    "[ fig : jtdz ] .",
    "the open points are the pythia distributions and the closed points are the reconstructed distributions .",
    "the latter are corrected for the tracking efficiency and any difference between the truth and reconstructed distributions are due to jet position resolution .",
    "the measurement of direct photons is another important tool for understanding the mechanism of energy loss .",
    "direct photons can be used as a means to pin down the @xmath29 of the initial hard scattering process to study the medium modification of the single , recoil jet . unfortunately , direct photons are amongst a large background of photons from hadronic decays .",
    "an nlo pqcd calculation@xcite predicts a direct photon signal to decay photon background of 2 - 10% from 30 - 100 gev photons at @xmath30 = 5.52 tev . to measure direct photons , reconstructed electromagnetic clusters",
    "are subjected to shower shape cuts and to isolation criteria to suppress the substantial background from hadronic decays .",
    "the atlas calorimeter was uniquely designed specifically to perform such isolation and shape analysis for photons by rejecting di - jets for the purpose of higgs seaches , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath8 segmentation of the front longitudinal electromagnetic ( strip ) layer is typically about 0.003 units . with this segmentation photons from @xmath31 decays can be separated over a wide range of @xmath19 . also , because of the fine segmentation , the occupancy is quite small . in unquenched hijing events with @xmath21 = 2700",
    ", the background contributes only a few hundred mev to a cell whereas a few gev photon will contribute typically half of its energy to the cell in the strip layer .",
    "therefore , the efficiency of making identification cuts based on the information from the strip layer is only weakly dependent on centrality ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : looseid ] ) .",
    "a series of shape variables can be constructed based on the energy distribution in the strip layer .",
    "these cuts have been tuned separately for each of the different hijing multiplicity samples that have been simulated . the resulting efficiency and rejection of these tuned cuts for several multiplicities is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : looseid ] .",
    "this particular set of cuts is `` loose '' so as to keep the efficiency high at @xmath3290% with a resulting relative rejection of up to 3 .",
    "a set of `` tight '' cuts has also been tuned which results in 50% efficiency with rejection up to a factor of 6 .",
    "though these rejections are not enough to overcome the large background from hadronic decays , it should be sufficient to perform a statistical subtraction and extract the spectrum of non - decay photons within jets , which come from photon fragmentation and may be enhanced by jet - medium bremsstrahlung photons@xcite .",
    "isolation criteria based on calorimetric energy and track @xmath0 within various cone sizes centered on the photon have been explored to gain additional rejection .",
    "these isolation criteria are a strong function of centrality and have been tuned for different multiplicities by requiring the highest rejection with at least 50% efficiency . for example , for @xmath21 = 2700 ,",
    "the isolation requirment within a cone of @xmath33=0.2 is @xmath34 31 gev and no reconstructed track with @xmath35 2.5 gev .",
    "the rejection and efficiency of these cuts as a function of photon @xmath19 are shown in fig .",

    "the resulting direct photon signal to hadronic decay background is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gammaspectrum ] .",
    "the ratio , with unsuppressed hadrons ( @xmath36 ) , is @xmath321 at 70 gev increasing rapidly with @xmath19 .",
    "however , if a factor of 5 suppression of hadrons from energy loss is measured at the lhc ( @xmath37 ) , the ratio is @xmath321 at 30 gev . assuming 0.5 @xmath38 of data per lhc year and a reconstruction efficiency of 50% , 2x10@xmath39 direct photons are expected with @xmath23 30 gev where the signal - to - background ratio is @xmath40 1 .",
    "a full set of measurements are being planned to carry out the atlas heavy ion physics program .",
    "jets , photons , global observables@xcite , quarkonia@xcite and other heavy flavor physics are being explored .",
    "the uniquely designed calorimeter will make jet and photon measurements a key strength of the atlas heavy ion program . the large acceptance and longitudinal segmentation results in high efficiency , more than 70% for @xmath23 70 gev , and high energy resolution , better than 25% for @xmath23 70 gev , at the highest expected multiplicities .",
    "direct photons will be measured with good efficiency , above 50% , and large signal - to - background , s / b more than 1 for @xmath23 30 gev , because of the uniquely designed strip layer of the electromagnetic calorimeter . with these measurements atlas",
    "is capable of making key measurements which will elucidate the nature of energy loss in the qcd medium .",
    "the figures shown here were based on studies using modified versions of atlas production software .",
    "thus , they should be considered `` atlas preliminary '' . for completeness ,",
