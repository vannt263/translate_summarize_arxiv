    "the usual treatment of scattering from many particle systems assumes the initial beam to be represented by a plane wave and shows that the scattering cross section is proportional to the fourier transform of the correlation function of the density fluctuations . for inelastic ( energy changing ) scattering",
    "this is the van hove time dependent correlation function , in the case of elastic scattering it is the static pair distribution function @xcite .",
    "the usual treatment then integrates the cross section for monochromatic plane waves over the spread of momentum in the incident and scattered beams .    in this work",
    "we show that another approach is both possible and interesting .",
    "as we do the entire calculation in real space - time our approach sheds new light on the emergence of the fourier transform in the scattering cross section .",
    "a crucial feature of our approach is that the influence of beam preparation on the resolution of the measurement is expressed by the correlation volume of the incident beam , which in turn , is determined by the optical ( in the sense of normal @xcite and time dependent @xcite optics ) properties of the beam preparation elements , _ e.g. _ slits and choppers .",
    "we will see that the lateral width of the beam correlation volume determines the possible spatial extent of the correlations which can be observed in a given experiment , and is inversely proportional to the @xmath0 resolution , as in the conventional treatment .",
    "the longitudinal extent of the beam correlation volume or the correlation time of the incident beam likewise sets the limit to the system correlation times which can be observed .",
    "the correlation volume @xmath1 is the conjugate volume to the momentum space volume @xmath2 and @xmath3 .    in a previous work @xcite",
    "we have discussed the neutron spin echo spectrometer @xcite from a similar point of view .",
    "we have shown that in that case the equivalent correlation volume is split longitudinally by the spin echo time , @xmath4 , which can be much longer than the correlation time of the incident beam .",
    "this splitting of the correlation volume results in the fact that the spin echo spectrometer measures the time dependence of the scattering system correlation function directly .",
    "when the incoming beam correlation volume is continuous ( not split ) , then the scattered wave is an integral over all space - time separations falling within the correlation volume of the incident beam and the result is the fourier transform of the space - time correlation function of the scattering system as will be seen below .",
    "the concept of correlation ( coherence ) volume has been applied to visible light optics for more than 50 years including such problems as the effect of the illumination on the resolution of a microscope .",
    "the correlation properties of a beam as a result of the optical properties of its preparing devices are known as the van cittert - zernike theorem @xcite , @xcite and @xcite and we will see how this can be applied to both time -dependent and -independent scattering .",
    "a frequently used technique for deconvoluting the instrument resolution from the measured data is to use the fourier transform of the resolution function @xcite . in the present work",
    "we show the physical significance of that fourier transform and show how it is determined by the optical properties of the beam .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that this fourier transform may contain more information than _",
    "e.g. _ the width of the resolution function .",
    "in fact it is the correlation function at long distances and times that is often of the greatest importance .",
    "an additional feature of our treatment is that the instrumental resolution is seen as an integral part of the experiment not something that is put in _ ad hoc _ after the calculation .",
    "it is well known that scattering experiments depend only on the spectrum @xmath5 of the incident beam and hence can be considered as the incoherent superposition of the results of experiments done with plane waves distributed according to this spectrum .",
    "this is easily seen in the context of the present work where we show that the scattering cross section depends on the auto - correlation function of the incident beam .",
    "the fourier transform of this auto - correlation is @xmath6 .",
    "in addition it is usually assumed that sources produce chaotic beams , _",
    "i.e. _ beams with @xmath7 , @xcite , so that in any case it is only @xmath5 which is significant .",
    "this is the case for stationary beams where @xmath8 is independent of @xmath9 .",
    "these points , and the possibilities of measuring @xmath10 have been discussed in @xcite and the references therein , and have been emphasized by mezei @xcite . for these reasons",
    "we feel that it is more convenient to talk about correlation volumes rather than coherence volumes as has been the practice in optics @xcite since it seems reasonable to reserve the term coherence for those cases where @xmath11 plays an important role .",
    "the correlation length @xmath12 discussed here and in section [ elscatt ] has real physical meaning ( as of course does its equivalent the spectral width @xmath13 ) .",
    "this can be seen by considering that in order to observe the famous two slit interference pattern ( young ) it is necessary to illuminate the two slits with correlated radiation .",
    "this is normally produced by having the two slits located in the main peak of the diffraction pattern produced by a third slit up - stream from the pair producing the interference pattern .",
    "the van cittert- zernike theorem is the rigorous expression of this point .",
    "the two point correlation function can be measured with such a double slit experiment by measuring the modulation ( visibility ) of the interference pattern as a function of the slit separation .",
    "of course the physical situation can be described according to the spectral viewpoint , where the incident beam is considered as an incoherent superposition of different @xmath14 vectors , by considering that for increasing slit separations the interference patterns for the different incident @xmath14 vectors begin to cancel out .",
    "recent experiments involving mssbauer scattering of synchrotron radiation have been described in terms of the beam correlation volume @xcite .",
    "these experiments can also be interpreted in terms of @xmath15 .",
    "however the authors have shown that the concept of a coherence ( correlation ) length is very useful for understanding this exciting experiment .    in the following",
    "we shall see that these ideas have a rigorous basis .",
    "we have presented the main features of these ideas with some physical examples in @xcite .",
    "we now discuss two simple examples to show the magnitudes of the correlation lengths ( times ) introduced by the shaping of the wave fields produced by the optical elements of the apparatus . as formulated by marathay  .. the field from a non - coherent ( _ uncorrelated ) _ source acquires coherence ( _ a finite correlation length ) _ by the very process of propagation . ",
    "( see @xcite , p.105 . )",
    "this is nothing else than what occurs when a random white noise signal acquires a finite correlation time as a result of passing through a low pass filter , something which can easily be observed with an oscilloscope .    for elastic scattering ,",
    "a beam collimated with slits of width @xmath16 separated by a distance @xmath17 , will have an angular width of @xmath18 and a spread in momentum perpendicular to the beam of @xmath19 .",
    "this will result in an uncertainty in momentum transfer @xmath0 of @xmath20 .",
    "on the other hand , seen according to quantum mechanics , a beam going through a slit of width @xmath16 will have an uncertainty in momentum @xmath21 and this will result in a lateral spreading over a distance @xmath22 at a distance @xmath17 in the @xmath9 direction . we see that the correlation length @xmath23 so that both arguments will lead to the same resolution . in order to put the argument on a firmer footing we need to show that a wave acquires a correlation length @xmath24 on passing through a slit of width @xmath25 @xmath24 is the length associated with a fraunhofer diffraction pattern of a slit .",
    "the problem is then to show that this length can arise in the case of fresnel diffraction ( finite distance @xmath17 ) .",
    "this is the content of the van - cittert zernike theorem ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) mentioned above . in this way we can describe the scattering process in terms of diffraction at the defining slits and the correlation length of the incident beam",
    ". we will be able to describe the scattering in real space instead of in the fourier transform space defined by @xmath26 .    for a small angle scattering instrument with wavelength of @xmath27__angst .",
    "_ _  and collimating slits @xmath28 wide separated by @xmath29 the correlation width will be about @xmath30__angst . , _ _",
    "_ i.e. _ much larger than the wavelength but much smaller than the slit width",
    ". correlations over larger distances than this can not be observed with the assumed instrument .    applying the same argument to a chopper for massive particles",
    "we see that for a chopper opening @xmath31 and time of flight @xmath32 we will have @xmath33 by the usual classical arguments .",
    "quantum mechanically , according to the uncertainty principle , passing through a chopper of width @xmath31 will result in a spread of energy given by @xmath34 and this spread in energy will result in a spread in arrival times @xmath35 .",
    "thus we should expect a correlation time of @xmath36 .",
    "for a time of flight instrument with pulse width @xmath37 and a flight path of @xmath38 , neutron wavelength @xmath39__angst .",
    "we obtain @xmath40 and this is the limit to the correlation times which can be observed with such an instrument .",
    "we will now show how the effects discussed above are contained in a quantum - mechanical calculation of the scattering . following the usual treatment of scattering @xcite , sec .",
    "2.1 , @xcite the scattered wave is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the exact solution for the wave function at the position @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is the green s function for the unperturbed problem @xmath45 .",
    "the notation is explained in figs . 4 and 6 . as is usual in van hove scattering we make the born approximation by replacing @xmath46 by the incident wave at the position of the scattering sample , @xmath47 and take ( for the case of neutron scattering ) @xmath48    ( for coherent scattering ) , _",
    "i.e. _ the fermi pseudo potential where @xmath49 is the position of the @xmath50 nucleus , the sum is over all nuclei in the scattering system and @xmath51 as defined in ( [ vferm ] ) is the particle density of the scatterer .",
    "@xmath52    the integration is carried out over the sample volume and the time interval during which the sample is exposed to the beam .",
    "equation ( [ two ] ) describes the scattered wave as a superposition of waves produced by many scattering events each occurring at the different space time points @xmath53(fig .",
    "this is in contrast to the usual van hove treatment @xcite , where one begins with the fermi golden rule for time dependent perturbations and shows , replacing the energy conservation delta function by its fourier transform , that the probability of scattering is given by the space - time fourier transform of the correlation function of @xmath54 . in the appendix to @xcite",
    "we have shown how one can derive the van hove result in a more direct way .",
    "introducing @xmath55 , @xmath56 we have from ( [ two ] ) for the intensity at the detector , @xmath57 : @xmath58    substituting the fermi potential we find @xmath59    here @xmath60 is the ( van hove ) density - density correlation function and is independent of @xmath43 , @xmath61 for the usual case of a homogeneous system .",
    "the result depends on the pair correlation function ( [ gs ] ) due to the fact that the intensity is proportional to the square of the amplitude as can readily be seen in the above derivation . because we restrict ourselves to the born approximation the result is independent of higher order correlation functions .",
    "@xmath62 is the auto - correlation function of the incident beam ( see fig.2 for the time independent case . ) .",
    "the brackets @xmath63 and @xmath64 indicate statistical averages over the sample and incoming beam ensembles respectively .    @xmath65 will be seen to be responsible for the contributions of the incident beam to the resolution of the measurement , as , according to ( [ 24 ] ) , the intensity only depends on the correlation function @xmath66 at values of @xmath67 where @xmath68 is significant .",
    "the wave function incident on the sample @xmath69 , is given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the incident wave function at the entrance of the apparatus where @xmath72is a green s function satisfying the boundary condition @xmath73 on the surface of integration , and @xmath74 is the gradient in the direction of the surface normal @xcite,@xcite .",
    "however this only introduces a change in the prefactor .",
    "see the appendix for a complete treatment . ] .",
    "we then find @xmath75 where @xmath76 ; @xmath77 and we have made the assumption that the incident beam is completely uncorrelated , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath78 as is usual in the derivation of the van cittert - zernike theorem @xcite,@xcite and @xcite . by the wiener - khintchine theorem",
    "@xcite we see this is equivalent to @xmath79 , _",
    "i.e. _ the incident spectrum is broad compared to that selected by the instrument .    in a scattering experiment",
    "we measure the integral of @xmath80 over the entrance area of the detector and , in the case of a time of flight experiment , a definite time interval , @xmath81 . from (",
    "[ 24 ] ) the intensity at the detector , @xmath82 , is given by @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 , @xmath86 .",
    "although ( [ biggy ] ) contains an explicit dependence on only space and time variables , the dependence on the energy and momentum transfer will be seen to emerge from the variation of the phases of the @xmath44 functions .",
    "now we see there is a symmetry between the integral over the detector parameters , @xmath57 , of the product of green s functions depending on @xmath87 , @xmath88 , ( equ .",
    "[ rout ] ) and the integral over the input slit @xmath89 of the green s function product depending on @xmath90 , @xmath91 , ( equ .",
    "[ rin ] ) so that we only have to do the calculation of one of the pairs , say the latter .",
    "we then obtain the former integral by applying the symmetry rules : @xmath92    while functions such as @xmath93 are usually called correlation functions they really represent a loss of correlation as their arguments increase . in the present context it is instructive to keep this in mind by referring to them as (loss of ) correlation functions.    thus while @xmath94 represents the loss of correlation between pairs of rays starting at the entrance slit @xmath95 , propagating to neighboring space time points in the sample @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 represents the loss of correlation due to the difference in path lengths in propagating from two neighboring points in the sample @xmath53 , @xmath99 to the detector @xmath100 .",
    "@xmath101 is the loss of correlation between the points @xmath53 , @xmath102 due to the internal dynamics of the scattering system ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . implicit in the above discussion is the fact that the detector responds to the value of @xmath103 at a single point integrated over the detector area .",
    "the above discussion brings out the fact that the scattering process is intrinsically an interference phenomenon , the cross section being a measure of the loss of correlation between waves following paths separated by @xmath104 at the sample .    in this paper",
    "we limit ourselves to pure coherent scattering .",
    "the separation of the scattering into a coherent and an incoherent part can be carried out exactly as in the conventional treatment .",
    "@xcite , @xcite . also in the interests of simplicity we choose to work with a real hydrodynamic density function @xmath105 .",
    "replacement of this by @xmath106 yields results consistent with the conventional approach @xcite , ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in this section we specialize to the case of scattering from a static system",
    ". we will consider time dependent systems in the following sections .    using the known form of the green s function for the time independent schrdinger equation , @xmath107 we calculate the input product of green s functions @xmath108 by expanding @xmath109 which holds to first order in @xmath110 .",
    "@xmath111 is the location of the center of the sample and we rewrite @xmath112 where @xmath113 is now a small quantity ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . then @xmath114 where we have taken a one dimensional slit of width @xmath115 and @xmath116 @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "@xmath119 is the component of @xmath120 perpendicular to the incident beam ( see fig.4 ) .",
    "the result ( [ rinsas ] ) is known as the van cittert - zernike theorem , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and has the form of the fraunhofer formula .",
    "note that this formula is applicable to geometries where one would not normally observe a fraunhofer diffraction pattern , except in the case of a spherical wave converging on the point of observation . in applications",
    "to optics the phase factors in ( [ rinsas ] ) , depending on the position of the pair of points with respect to the center of the sample , as well as on the distance between them are often neglected so that the correlation functions can be considered as real functions depending only on the distance between the two points .",
    "however the phase factors play a crucial role in scattering , bringing in the influence of the sample size on the resolution and the dependence on the energy and momentum transfer , as shown below .",
    "by symmetry ( [ symrule ] ) we can write @xmath121 where @xmath122 represents the component of @xmath123 in the direction perpendicular to the direction of the scattered beam , @xmath124and @xmath125 is the width of the detector slit ( see fig .",
    "then writing the steady state form of ( [ biggy ] ) we have @xmath126    substituting ( [ rinsas ] ) and ( [ routsas ] ) in ( [ biggyss ] ) we have @xmath127 the term @xmath128 comes from the phase factor which is normally neglected in optics .",
    "( _ note that _",
    "@xmath129 , a point which will be discussed in the next section . ) in the present case this factor means that moving the location of the correlation regions defined by the two @xmath130 functions ( varying @xmath131 ) in ( [ 36 ] ) causes an additional difference in the two optical paths going from the entrance slit to the detector slit via the two points separated by @xmath120 , _",
    "i.e. _ the two paths in fig .",
    "4 . this optical path difference represents an additional loss in correlation as the pair of points separated by a constant @xmath120 move away from the optical axis and determines the influence of the sample slit width @xmath132 on the resolution .      for simplicity",
    "we will now consider the case of small angle scattering where the only significant component of @xmath120 is @xmath133 and @xmath134    performing the @xmath135 integration in ( [ 36 ] ) over a slit of width @xmath136 @xmath137 defining the sample size yields @xmath138   2b\\left [   \\frac{\\sin k\\frac{\\delta_{y}b}{r^{\\prime}}% } { k\\frac{\\delta_{y}b}{r^{\\prime}}}\\right ]   2a\\left [   \\frac{\\sin k\\frac { \\delta_{y}a}{r_{1}}}{k\\frac{\\delta_{y}a}{r_{1}}}\\right ]   \\label{xx}%\\ ] ] where we have neglected the extension of the sample in the @xmath139 direction .",
    "for @xmath140 small , corresponding to a high @xmath26 resolution , the functions in square brackets approach unity for the values of @xmath24 for which @xmath66 is significant , and we have the usual result @xmath141    the same result is obtained if we take the incident and outgoing states as plane waves .",
    "the result of an experiment for non - negligible @xmath140 must then be found by taking the convolution of ( [ norm ] ) with an instrumental resolution function . in the approach of ( [ xx ] ) however ,",
    "the resolution is contained in the ( loss of ) correlation functions in the square brackets .",
    "( [ xx ] ) clearly shows how correlations between points in the sample separated by larger values of @xmath24 contribute less to the intensity .",
    "however due to the nature of the @xmath130 functions there are some contributions to the scattering from these larger values , and some regions of @xmath24 contribute with a negative sign .",
    "these effects , at the 10% level , which do not appear if we approximate the @xmath130 functions by gaussians of an appropriate width as is often done in practice , become more important for measurements at poor resolution such as in quasi - elastic line broadening .",
    "we see that equ .",
    "( [ xx ] ) is the fourier transform with respect to @xmath120 of a product of @xmath142 with a function @xmath143 which is itself the product of three functions,@xmath144 , @xmath145and @xmath146 .",
    "thus the result ( [ xx ] ) is the convolution of the fourier transform of @xmath147 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath148 , with the fourier transform of @xmath149 .",

    "the convolution of two rectangular functions in @xmath160 @xmath161 and @xmath162 , yields a trapezoid with a base bounded by @xmath163 and a top bounded by @xmath164 just what is expected on geometrical grounds for a collimator consisting of two slits of width @xmath115 and @xmath136 separated by a distance @xmath9 as seen by a point @xmath165 away from the second slit ( see fig .",
    "the subsequent convolution with @xmath166 yields the effect of finite detector width . from ( [ xx ] )",
    "the correlation length of the input function @xmath167 is seen to be @xmath168 , while ( [ eta ] ) gives the width @xmath169 in @xmath0 , to be @xmath170 . hence @xmath171",
    "@xmath172 @xmath173 where the momentum width @xmath174 .",
    "thus our result ( [ xx ] ) is identical with the usual treatment which yields the convolution of @xmath148 with the resolution function but our view of the scattering is quite different .",
    "we see the scattering process as the interaction with the sample of a state whose wave function has a certain spatial auto - correlation function determined by the optical properties of the devices used to define the incoming beam .",
    "this has the effect that only pairs of scattering points whose separation is less than the correlation length of the incident beam contribute significantly to the scattered wave and pairs with different separations @xmath120 are weighted by the auto - correlation function of the incoming beam evaluated at @xmath120 .",
    "analogous statements apply to the outgoing beam .",
    "similar considerations have been used by many people ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) as a means of deconvoluting the instrument resolution from the measured data . however , in the work cited no mention is made of the physical significance of the fourier transform of the instrument resolution function ( our @xmath175 is called @xmath176 in ( @xcite ) ) as the ( loss of ) correlation functions of the incident and scattered wave functions . in the above treatment",
    "we see how the resolution function is the result of the optical properties of the devices defining the incident and scattered beams .",
    "in the previous section we have seen that the contribution to @xmath177 from the correlation function of the incident beam represents the effect on the resolution due to the collimation of the incident beam and the correlation function of the scattered beam results in that part of the resolution due to the angular resolution of the scattered beam .",
    "each element of the optical system defining the beam is seen to contribute a factor to the overall correlation function .    in the following we try to illustrate the relation between our treatment of the scattering problem and the conventional approach by concentrating on the contribution of the incident beam to the resolution .",
    "if we write @xmath178    then we have @xmath179    substituting this into ( [ biggyss ] ) and writing @xmath180 we obtain @xmath181    in this case we have taken @xmath182 and we obtain @xmath148 averaged over the momentum spectrum of the incident beam .    in the previous section we took @xmath183 , _",
    "i.e. _ the difference between the final wave vector , and the incoming wave vector . by this",
    "we mean the wave vector corresponding to a central ray of the incident or scattered beam .",
    "then , in that case , the distribution in @xmath184 or what contains the same information , the correlation function of the incident beam produced by the optical properties of the defining slits , gives the usual result of @xmath148 convoluted with an instrumental resolution function . on the other hand , in this section by taking @xmath185 we have assumed perfect knowledge of @xmath184 @xmath186 and we complete the calculation ( equ . [ squatty ] ) by integrating over all values of @xmath26 corresponding to the spread in @xmath187 values in the incident beam .",
    "this will of course yield the same results as the previous treatment .",
    "we will assume a cylindrical shaped sample ( radius @xmath188 ) with its axis perpendicular to the scattering plane and thus consider the problem as a two dimensional one .",
    "then the integral over the sample volume in ( [ 36 ] ) can be written as @xmath189 where @xmath190 represents the dimension of the sample perpendicular to the scattering plane .",
    "the final result is then @xmath191 where @xmath192 is the fourier transform of the resolution function .",

    "corresponding to the @xmath130 functions in one dimension the function @xmath194 in two dimensions represents a square shaped resolution in @xmath0 but in the latter case the resolution is a function of @xmath195 rather than a component of @xmath26 in the one dimensional cases .",
    "the term involving @xmath196 gives the influence of the width of the entrance slit @xmath197 on the resolution ; it depends on @xmath198 but not on @xmath199 .",
    "the term in @xmath200 gives the influence of the detector slit width @xmath201 on the resolution and depends on @xmath199 .",
    "the remaining term gives the influence of the sample size and depends on @xmath202 because an uncertainty in position at the sample effects the angular resolution in both arms .",
    "the argument of each term can be written as @xmath203 where the @xmath204 are correlation lengths corresponding to the size of the correlations that can be observed with a given installation . when any of the terms is small , so is the contribution to the total integral , so that the only significant contribution comes from values of @xmath120 for which each term in ( [ h ] ) is significant .",
    "thus the resolution is determined by the overlap of the different correlation volumes and the measurement can be optimized by choosing all regions as approximately equal .    equ .",
    "( [ qquutt ] ) has been derived for the case of a single incident energy .",
    "it is easy to see that if we took an incident spectrum constant in a region @xmath205 that the result will be an additional term @xmath130 with @xmath206 , where @xmath207 are the components of @xmath120 along the directions of @xmath208 respectively .",
    "a more detailed discussion including the influence of the scattering angle will be presented in a forthcoming paper .      in neutron spin echo for elastic scattering ,",

    "the opening times @xmath260 influence the resolution by an amount depending on @xmath261 respectively , while @xmath262 contributes to the uncertainty in the travel times in both arms and depends on a weighted combination of the two travel times .",

    "we see that the terms proportional to @xmath255 will give the energy resolution and those proportional to @xmath24 will give the @xmath0 resolution .",

    "modification of these elements can readily be accommodated as shown in the next section .",
    "if we wish we can follow the more usual procedure of replacing each term by a gaussian function with the appropriate width .",
    "this then allows an easy way to estimate the overall width of the @xmath311 resolution ( given by the convolution of the fourier transform of each term in @xmath310 ) as the square root of the sum of the squares of the widths of each term and shows that the optimum is when all the widths are equal .",
    "each factor in ( [ hehe ] ) is associated with a certain velocity in @xmath312 space so that the relevant correlation volumes can be considered as moving as a function of @xmath255 .",
    "for example the volume associated with @xmath304 is moving with a velocity @xmath313 , the nominal velocity of the scattered wave .",
    "thus we see that the coherence volume associated with the detector parameters can be considered as consisting of the region limited by @xmath314 in the @xmath122 direction and @xmath315 in the @xmath316 direction , moving ( as function of @xmath255 ) with velocity @xmath317 in the @xmath318 direction ( direction of the scattered beam ) .",
    "each of the other pairs of terms contributes a similar moving limit to the region of @xmath319 space .    in a forthcoming work",
    "we will present a detailed discussion of the shapes and behavior of these correlation volumes for a series of instruments .",
    "we now modify the above treatment to consider the more realistic case where the chopper slits move with finite speed .",
    "see @xcite for discussion of a related problem .",

    "the correlation function ( [ rnew ] ) is seen to have the correct normalization at @xmath329 , _",
    "i.e. _ at @xmath330 .",
    "the two terms have separated maxima occurring at @xmath331 where @xmath332 is the component of @xmath120 along the direction of the incident beam and @xmath119 its component in the perpendicular direction .",
    "thus for @xmath333 the maxima lie on the lines through the origin : @xmath334 where @xmath335 is the velocity of the slit boundary . for non - zero @xmath255",
    "the slope of the lines stays the same but the crossing point moves along the @xmath332 axis with a velocity @xmath336 .",
    "the correlation volume for the input beam , _",
    "i.e. _ the overlap region where the two factors in ( [ rnew ] ) are significant , is thus seen to be given by a complex interplay between the slopes of the lines and the widths of the @xmath130 functions which depend on the correlation lengths @xmath337 and the correlation time @xmath338 .",
    "this is a demonstration of some of the advantages of the present method , showing how a change of a component can be easily accommodated and how complex relationships between the energy and momentum resolution can be represented in a straight forward manner .",
    "starting with fermi s golden rule for perturbation theory and assuming the incident and final wave functions of the scattered particles to be plane waves , van hove @xcite showed that the scattering cross section is proportional to a function of the momentum and energy transfer , @xmath339 , which in turn is the fourier transform of the time and space dependent auto - correlation function of the density fluctuations of the scattering system .",
    "however since no experiment is ever done with perfect resolution , measurements yield the convolution of @xmath340 with an instrument resolution function .",
    "the determination of the resolution and its use in the interpretation of the data are left to the experimenters .    in this conventional approach a scattering experiment",
    "is divided up into two separate parts which are treated by two , different , mutually exclusive approximations .",
    "the scattering event in the sample is treated by assuming infinitely extended plane waves for the incident and scattered beams , while the beam is treated as consisting of classical point particles in order to describe its motion through the apparatus .",
    "this same , dual approach is also used to discuss multiple scattering : the scattering events are described as a scattering of plane wave states while the motion between two scattering points is treated as a classical trajectory .",
    "we hope to present a unified treatment of multiple scattering using the present approach in the near future .    in the present work ,",
    "the entire scattering experiment is described as a wave - optical phenomenon .",
    "this more general approach provides a rigorous justification for the usual dual approximation since , in most cases the correlation volumes are much smaller than the geometrical dimensions ( beam cross sections , chopper pulse lengths , etc . )",
    "however in some cases this is not true and the complete wave - optical description of the global system of instrument and scattering sample must be used .",
    "in addition to precision light scattering experiments such cases include perfect crystal neutron optics ( _ e.g. _ interferometry ) where the definition of the wave vector is so precise that the correlation lengths can be comparable to the geometrical dimensions .",
    "these cases are sometimes referred to as  spherical wave effects@xcite .",
    "in fact these effects are natural consequences of the full wave - optical analysis presented here .",
    "usual methods of determining the resolution include measurement of a known calibration sample , monte carlo calculations and estimates based on assuming a gaussian form for the separate contributions to the overall resolution so that the separate contributions can be combined using the sum of squares rule .    one method of carrying out the deconvolution is to divide the fourier transform of the measured data by the fourier transform of the resolution function .",
    "usually however a model form is assumed for @xmath341 and some parameters of the model are varied until the convolution with the resolution function gives agreement with the measured data .    in the present work",
    "we calculate the incoming wave function as it is shaped by transmission through the elements of the apparatus according to the laws of optics .",
    "for example on propagating through a slit and/or a chopper a wave acquires a correlation function with a finite width . after scattering , the individual waves scattered from a neighboring pair of points in the sample lose correlation on passing through the post - sample elements of the apparatus .",
    "we have shown that the probability of a scattered particle arriving at a detector at a given space - time location is proportional to the fourier transform of the density fluctuation auto - correlation function ( as shown by van hove ) but multiplied by a function @xmath342 which represents the resolution of the measurement and is the fourier transform of the instrument resolution as it is normally considered .",
    "this function is the product of a series of functions , each representing the effect of a single element of the apparatus on the measurement .",
    "changes in one element can be easily accommodated by changes in the appropriate function .",
    "the regions of @xmath343 space where each function is significant are the correlation volumes for the different elements of the apparatus .",
    "a measurement can be optimized by maximizing the region of overlap of all the correlation volumes .",
    "the fact that these volumes are seen to be moving as a function of the correlation time @xmath255 , is a reflection of the fact that the @xmath309 , and @xmath26 resolutions depend on each other to some extent and we have an analytic description of this dependence .",
    "the present analysis offers a graphical method of optimizing each measurement , with the influence of all parameters such as the scattering angle included . in a forthcoming work",
    "we will give detailed examples of how this can be carried out for various types of scattering measurements .",
    "in the main text we have neglected all prefactors and normalizing constants in the green s functions and incident wave function . in this appendix",
    "we will show how inclusion of these factors leads to the usual expression for the cross section and give a proper calculation of @xmath69 as mentioned in footnote 2 of section 2 .",
