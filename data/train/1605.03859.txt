    "driven diffusive systems ( dds ) evolve under local stochastic dynamics where by some conserved quantity such as mass , energy or charge is being driven through the system @xcite .",
    "compared to their equilibrium counterparts , these systems exhibit rich steady state behaviour @xcite including phase separation @xcite and condensation transition @xcite in one dimension , boundary layers @xcite , localized shocks @xcite and have found a wide range of applications such as transport in super - ionic conductors @xcite , protein synthesis in prokaryotic cells @xcite , traffic flow@xcite , biophysical transport @xcite etc . .",
    "recently , dds with two or more species have been studied @xcite ; some of these systems with more than one conserved quantities @xcite also exhibit phase transition even in one dimension .",
    "it is argued in @xcite that phase separation transition in dds is related to the condensation transition in a corresponding zero - range process ( zrp ) @xcite .",
    "driven diffusive systems show interesting steady state behavior when the constituting objects are extended @xcite in the sense that they occupy more than one lattice site and move together as a single object called @xmath0-mer , obeying hardcore constraints . in one dimension , a driven system involving monodispersed @xmath0-mers was studied to understand the physical mechanism of protein synthesis in prokaryotic cells @xcite .",
    "for such a system , the time evolution of the conditional probabilities of the site occupation , starting from a known initial configuration has been calculated @xcite , and phase diagram for such systems has also been reported @xcite .",
    "other works on such systems include studying hydrodynamic equations governing the local density evolution @xcite and the effect of inhomogeneities and defects @xcite . microscopic processes like reconstitution ,",
    "if present , can generate @xmath0-mers of arbitrary lengths and facilitates the possibility of phase separation .",
    "in a recent article @xcite we have shown that diffusing and reconstituting @xmath0-mers can be mapped to an interacting box - particle system with two species of particles .",
    "this mapping helps us in finding the exact phase boundaries of the phase separation transition in @xmath0-mer dynamics .",
    "depending on the rate of the re - constitution dynamics , one can obtain a macroscopic long polymer ( which corresponds to condensation of particles ) . at the same time , since the motion of @xmath0-mers depends on their size , the system might go to a phase where a large @xmath0-mer moves so slow that it generates a large number of vacancies in front of it - this would lead to condensation of the holes ( @xmath1s ) .",
    "of course , in special situations , one may encounter simultaneous condensation of particles and holes . in this article , we aim at calculating spatial correlation in reconstituting @xmath0-mer models .",
    "spatial correlation functions , up to now , has been calculated for models with monodispersity , i.e. when all @xmath0-mers are of equal size @xcite .",
    "it has been found that steady state of these models can be written in matrix product form and correlation function in these models oscillate in both space and time @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in the continuum limit , the scaling behavior of the spatial correlation is found to be same as obtained for a driven tonks gas @xcite .",
    "various polydispersed models consisting of particles of different sizes and hence as many conservation laws have also been studied @xcite .",
    "their phase behavior in general show strongly broken ergodicity and the dynamical critical behavior .",
    "the above mentioned matrix formulation for fixed size @xmath0-mers can not describe the polydispersed systems where the @xmath0 mers change their lengths dynamically . in a mono - dispersed system ,",
    "where all the @xmath0-mers are of equal length , the @xmath0-mer density automatically fixes the packing fraction of the lattice . in reconstituting @xmath0-mer models , however , the density of @xmath0-mers and packing fraction are unrelated and independently conserved .",
    "thus , configurations on a lattice , though contain only @xmath2s and @xmath1s , can not be expressed as before by matrix strings containing just @xmath3s ( for @xmath2s ) and @xmath4s ( for @xmath1s ) - an additional matrix must be introduced to identify each @xmath0-mer and to keep track of the conservation of @xmath0-mer density .",
    "it turns out that the additional conservation law plays an important role in determining the stationary and dynamical properties of reconstituting @xmath0-mer models . in this article",
    "we provide a formalism to write the stationary state of polydispersed @xmath0-mers in matrix product from and calculate the spatial correlation functions analytically .",
    "we show that when reconstitution occurs between @xmath0-mers of size @xmath5 and @xmath6 with rate @xmath7 one can _ always _ write an infinite dimensional representation of matrices in terms of the rate functions .",
    "however , some specific cases can be represented by finite dimensional matrices .",
    "one such example is the constant - rate reconstitution ( crr ) model where reconstitution occurs with constant rate and monomers diffuse with a rate different from the the other @xmath0-mers .",
    "we calculate spatial correlation functions of crr model explicitly and find that they show damped oscillations in some parameter regime and decay exponentially in other regimes .",
    "the disorder line that separates these regimes is also calculated .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we introduce the reconstituting @xmath0-mer models and develop the matrix formulation to calculate the steady state weights of configurations from representing string of matrices .",
    "in section [ sec : example ] , we introduce the crr model , which has a finite dimensional matrix representation , and calculate the spatial correlation functions and the disorder line explicitly for a given diffusion rate .",
    "also , in this section we show that the crr model in a special limit , exhibits phase coexistence similar to the one observed in asymmetric exclusion process with a single defect .",
    "finally , we conclude and summarize the results in section [ sec : conclude ] .",
    "let us consider a driven diffusive system of polydispersed @xmath0-mers on a one dimensional periodic lattice involving the directed diffusion and reconstitution dynamics . along with drift ,",
    "the @xmath0-mers change their size through exchange of monomer units .",
    "it is assumed that the reconstitution dynamics does not allow complete fusion of monomers and thus , not only the mass ( the total length of the @xmath0-mers ) but also the number of @xmath0-mers is conserved .",

    "engine of the @xmath0-mers are marked as orange .",
    "the rate of drift @xmath8 depends on the length of the corresponding @xmath0-mers .",
    "reconstitution occurs only among consecutive immobile @xmath0-mers with a rate @xmath9 which depends on their lengths .",

    "let us consider @xmath12 number of @xmath0-mers on on a one dimensional periodic lattice of @xmath13 sites labeled by the index @xmath14 the @xmath0-mers , each having different integer length , are also labeled sequentially as @xmath15    a @xmath0-mer is a hard extended object which occupies @xmath0 consecutive sites on a lattice , and can be denoted by a string of @xmath0 consecutive @xmath2s ( here represented by @xmath16 ) .",
    "thus , every configuration of the system can be represented by a binary sequence with each site @xmath17 carrying a variable @xmath18 or @xmath1 denoting respectively whether the lattice site is occupied by a @xmath0-mer or not .",

    ".    if we overlook these differences , the models are similar when @xmath291 thus one may speculate that a phase coexistence may occur when @xmath292 in reality , however , for dynamics ( [ 1dimera ] ) , phase coexistence occurs when @xmath293 this similarity is striking - particularly when the matrix representation for ( [ eq : defect ] ) is infinite dimensional whereas the same for ( [ 1dimera ] ) is much simpler , @xmath236 matrices .",
    "in this article we provide a general formulation to write the steady state weights of reconstituting @xmath0-mer models in matrix product form . in the matrix formulation ,",
    "we represent a vacancy by a matrix @xmath4 , the engine of a @xmath0-mer ( leading monomer unit from the left ) by @xmath62 and rest of the monomer units by @xmath3s . in these models ,",
    "the @xmath0-mers , which are extended objects of different sizes , move to neighboring vacant sites with a rate that depends on their size .",
    "reconstitution can occur among a pair of @xmath0-mers , when they are in contact , with a rate that depends on size of participating objects .",
    "reconstitution usually means transfer of a monomer from one @xmath0-mer to the other one ; we restrict such a transfer if length of the @xmath0-mer transferring a monomer , is unity .",
    "this keeps the number of @xmath0-mers conserved .",
    "these models can not be solved exactly for any arbitrary diffusion and reconstitution rates .",
    "some of them can be solved , under quite general conditions , using a mapping of @xmath0-mer models to a two species misanthrope process .",
    "these exactly solvable models , though simple , capture the different phases of the system and possible transitions among them @xcite quite well .",
    "however , calculating spatial correlation functions through this mapping is usually a formidable task , as the mapping does not keep track of the site - indices and the notion of distance .",
    "thus , rewriting the steady state weights in terms of a matrix product form is greatly useful .",
    "if @xmath0-mers are mono - dispersed , i.e. , each one has a fixed length @xmath0 , the matrix product form is relatively simple @xcite .",
    "this is because , the density of @xmath0-mers @xmath169 dictates the packing fraction @xmath294 , and one can get away with two matrices @xmath3 and @xmath4 representing whether the site is occupied or not .",
    "the fact , poly - dispersed systems studied here have _ two _ independent conserved quantities @xmath169 and @xmath168 , brings in additional complications . first , to write the steady state in matrix product form , we need an additional matrix @xmath62 ( along with @xmath295 ) to identify the @xmath0-mers and to keep track of the conserved @xmath0-mer number . next",
    ", additional care must be taken to ensure that every block of vacancies must end with @xmath62- in other words all configurations must be devoid of @xmath74    in summary , the reconstituting @xmath0-mer models for which the steady state weights can be obtained exactly through a two species misanthrope process , we device a matrix formulation to calculate spatial correlation functions explicitly . the required matrix algebra , and a generic representation that satisfies this algebra are also provided .",
    "specifically , we demonstrate the formulation for the constant - rate reconstitution ( crr ) model where reconstitution occurs with a constant rate @xmath91 and all @xmath0-mers except the monomer , move to its right neighbour ( if vacant ) with unit rate ; the rate for monomers is @xmath296 the two point spatial correlation functions of crr model show interesting behavior when @xmath0-mer density @xmath169 and packing fraction @xmath168 are tuned . in some density regime",
    "the spatial correlation functions show damped oscillation whereas in other regimes they decay exponentially .",
    "the boundary that separates these regimes in @xmath169-@xmath168 plane , conventionally known as the _ disorder line , _ is calculated analytically .    a special limit @xmath297 of the crr model is best represented by a system of monomers and a _ single _ dimer .",
    "the reconstitution process in this single dimer model is equivalent to exchange of a monomer with the dimer , when in contact .",
    "effectively , the dimer behaves like a defect in the system and exhibits a phase coexistence , similar to the one observed in asymmetric exclusion processes with a single defect . we must mention that , though both models capture the phase separation scenario , the single dimer model is represented by a set of simpler @xmath236 matrices in contrast to the infinite dimensional representation in exclusion processes with a defect .    in all through this article",
    "we have considered directed diffusion of @xmath0-mers .",
    "this provides a natural interpretation that reconstitution occurs among immobile @xmath0-mers .",
    "however , the steady state and thus physical properties of the model are invariant if we use , a symmetric diffusion of @xmath0-mers , and a reconstitution process that does not allow two particles of different species ( in corresponding two species misanthrope process ) to move out of a box simultaneously .    in this article",
    "we provide matrix product steady states for a class of @xmath0- mer models , by mapping them to a two species misanthrope process .",
    "in fact any two species misanthrope process can be mapped to a lattice containing extended objects - the steady state of such systems can _ always _ be be written in matrix product form .",
    "we believe that the matrix formulation developed here can be useful , in general , to explore spatial correlation functions in extended systems in one dimension .",
