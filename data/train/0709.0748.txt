    "geometric complexity theory ( gct ) is a plausible approach to the @xmath0 vs @xmath1 @xcite and related problems in complexity theory via algebraic geometry and representation theory .",
    "the goal of this paper is to give a high - level overview of its basic plan and the underlying principle called the _ flip _ , without assuming any background in algebraic geometry or representation theory . a detailed exposition for mathematicians will appear in @xcite",
    ". a brief proposal and announcement appeared earlier in cf.@xcite .",
    "the flip has been partially implemented in a series of papers @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this article , followed by @xcite , should provide an introduction to the overall structure of gct for computer scientists who wish to get a high - level picture before going any further .",
    "we assume a few elementary notions of algebraic geometry and representation theory in this introduction .",
    "they are described in full detail in section  [ sbasicdefn ] , which can be referred to if necessary . for the readers looking for a quick overview",
    ", the article @xcite , which gives a nontechnical synopsis of this paper , followed by just this introduction , which has been written to read as a short paper , should suffice .    in this article , the underlying field of computation",
    "is taken be @xmath2 . in @xcite , the problems that arise in the context of the flip over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic , or a finite field are discussed .",
    "the usual @xmath3 conjecture is over a finite field of which the one over @xmath2 is in a sense the crux and , being also a formal implication @xcite , has to be proved first anyway .",
    "the flip , in essence , `` reduces '' the negative hypotheses ( lower bound problems ) in complexity theory , such as the @xmath4 conjecture over @xmath2 , to positive hypotheses in complexity theory ( upper bound problems ) : specifically , to showing that a series of decision problems in representation theory and algebraic geometry belong to the complexity class @xmath0 .",
    "the `` reduction '' here is only `` in essence '' .",
    "it is not a formal turing machine reduction .",
    "if it were , it would be relativizable .",
    "it is described briefly in section  [ sreductionintro ] below , and in detail in section  [ sreduction ] later .",
    "this reduction basically constitutes a flip from _",
    "hard , nonexistence _ to _",
    "easy existence_. in @xcite , these complexity - theoretic positive hypotheses are further reduced to mathematical positivity hypotheses , supported by the theoretical and experimental evidence therein .",
    "the mathematical positivity hypotheses roughly say that certain nonnegative structural functions in algebraic geometry and representation theory have _ positive _ formulae  i.e . ,",
    "formulae without alternating signs  akin to the usual formula for the permanent ( in contrast , the usual formula for the determinant has alternating signs ) .",
    "it turns out that the validity of these mathematical positivity hypotheses is intimately linked to the riemann hypothesis over finite fields  proved in @xcite as a culmination of extensive effort in mathematics  and the related works in algebraic geometry and the theory of quantum groups @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a plan is suggested for proving them via the theory of quantum groups .",
    "generalizations of the standard quantum group @xcite needed for this purpose , which we call _ nonstandard quantum groups _ , are constructed in @xcite , with further conjectural extensions pointed out in @xcite .",
    "all papers of gct together suggest that if the riemann hypothesis over finite fields and the related works in the theory of standard quantum groups mentioned above can be systematically extended to the setting of the nonstandard quantum groups that arise in gct , then this may lead to the proof of the @xmath5 conjecture over @xmath2 .",
    "this basic plan of gct is summarized in figure  [ fbasicintro ] .",
    "question marks indicate the main open problems .",
    "@xmath6    the proof in characteristic zero may eventually extend to finite fields , as in the usual form of the conjecture , along the lines suggested in @xcite .",
    "thus the ultimate goal of the gct flip is to deduce the ultimate negative hypothesis of mathematics , the @xmath3 conjecture , in essence , from the ultimate positive hypotheses in mathematics , ( nonstandard ) riemann hypotheses , thereby giving the ultimate flip shown in figure  [ fgctultimate ] .",
    "@xmath7    in the rest of this introduction , we elaborate figure  [ fbasicintro ] further .",
    "the author is deeply grateful to madhav nori , who taught him algebraic geometry , milind sohoni , who collaborated in gct 1 - 4 , and manju the source of energy behind this work .",
    "the author is also grateful to a. razborov for pointing out the need for a high - level account .",
    "this article is essentially an elaboration of the answers to his questions .",
    "a part of this work was done while the author was visiting i.i.t .",
    "mumbai to which the author is grateful for its hospitality .",
    "it is also a pleasure to thank the graduate students who took the accompanying introductory course @xcite on gct for their feedback .",
    "we begin with the top arrow in figure  [ fbasicintro ] : the flip .",
    "it is motivated by the _",
    "classical flip_from the undecidable ( negative ) to the decidable ( positive)that occurs in gdel s incompleteness theorem . all known lower bound results ",
    "the hierarchy theorems in complexity theory or the lower bound results in the constant depth @xcite or the pram model without bit operations @xcite  depend on flips from lower bounds to upper bounds of some sort .",
    "but such variations of the classical flip can not work in the context of the @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 problem because they are either relativizable @xcite or naturalizable @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the flip here should be nonrelativizable and nonnaturalizable ( section  [ snatural ] ) .",
    "there are actually two flips within this flip : ( 1 ) from nonexistence to existence , and ( 2 ) from hard to easy . here",
    "hard means : the problem of deciding if a computational circuit of size @xmath8 exists for a given function @xmath9 is hard .",
    "accordingly , the flip from hard nonexistence to easy existence goes in two stages .",
    "the flip from nonexistence to existence is addressed in @xcite . here",
    "the nonexistence ( lower bound ) problem is reduced to an existence problem : specifically , to the problem of proving existence of _ obstructions _ , which serve as `` proofs '' or `` witnesses '' for nonexistence of an efficient computational circuit for the explicit hard function in the lower bound problem under consideration . just as existence of a forbidden kurotowoski minor in a graph serves as an obstruction , i.e. , a `` proof '' for nonexistence of a planar embedding .",
    "an obstruction in @xcite is intuitively defined as follows .",
    "first a specific ( co)-np - complete function @xmath10 , and a specific @xmath0-complete function @xmath11 are constructed in @xcite so as to have special properties that we shall describe in a moment .",
    "using @xmath12 , a projective algebraic variety @xmath13 , for every positive integer @xmath14 , is associated with the complexity class @xmath0 , called the _",
    "class variety _ associated with @xmath0 , or the simply the _ @xmath0-variety_. here , a projective algebraic variety means the zero set of a system of homogeneous polynomial equations ( cf .",
    "section  [ sbasicdefnalg ] ) .",
    "these are generalizations of the familar curves and surfaces .",
    "it will turn out that @xmath15 is a @xmath16-variety for @xmath17 , the group of invertible @xmath18 complex matrices .",
    "this means elements of @xmath16 act on this variety as its transformations ",
    "move its points around  just as @xmath16 acts on @xmath19 in the usual way .",
    "similarly , using @xmath20 , a projective variety @xmath21 , for every positive integer @xmath22 and @xmath23 , is associated with the complexity class @xmath1 .",
    "it is called the _",
    "class variety _ associated with @xmath1 , or simply the _ @xmath1-variety_. it will again be a @xmath16-variety .",
    "the functions @xmath20 and @xmath12 have been specially chosen so that these class varieties are exceptional and their algebraic geometry can be analyzed in depth .",
    "if @xmath20 can be computed by a circuit of size @xmath8 , then it would turn out that @xmath24 can be embedded in @xmath15 as a @xmath16-subvariety for @xmath25 .",
    "pictorially : @xmath26 we want to show that this embedding is impossible if @xmath27 , as @xmath28 .",
    "this would show that @xmath20 can not be computed by a circuit of @xmath27 size , and hence , @xmath3 over @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote the homogeneous coordinate rings of @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively . here by the coordinate ring of a variety , we mean the ring of polynomial `` functions '' ( of some kind ) on the variety as defined in section  [ sbasicdefnalg ] .",
    "these are akin to the ring of polynomial functions on @xmath19",
    ". since the class varieties are @xmath16-varieties , these homogeneous coordinate rings will be @xmath16-representations ( section  [ sbasicdefnrepr ] ) . by a @xmath16-representation we mean a vector space on which the elements of @xmath16 act as linear transformations , just as they do on @xmath19 .",
    "if the embedding ( [ eqembasic ] ) exists , then it would turn out that @xmath33 is a @xmath16-subrepresentation of @xmath34 .",
    "we say that an irreducible , i.e. , a minimal , nonzero representation @xmath35 of @xmath16 is an _ obstruction _ , for given @xmath22 and @xmath14 , if it occurs as a @xmath16-subrepresentation of @xmath33 , but not as a @xmath16-subrepresentation of @xmath34 .",
    "existence of such a @xmath35 , for given @xmath22 and @xmath14 , implies that @xmath33 can not be embedded as a @xmath16-subrepresentation of @xmath34 , and hence , the embedding ( [ eqembasic ] ) can not exist .",
    "thus an obstruction serves as a `` witness '' or a `` proof '' that the embedding ( [ eqembasic ] ) can not exist .",
    "we now reformulate this notion of obstruction using a few basic notions in representation theory described in section  [ sbasicdefnrepr ] .",
    "it is known that ( polynomial ) irreducible representations of @xmath16 are in one - to - one correspondence with the set of sequences , also called _ partitions _ , @xmath36 of positive integers of length @xmath37 .",
    "the irreducible representation of @xmath16 labelled by @xmath38 is called a _",
    "weyl - module _ , and is denoted by @xmath39 .",
    "it is also known that each finite dimensional representation @xmath40 of @xmath16 can be written as a direct sum of irreducible representations : @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the direct sum of @xmath43 copies of @xmath39 , and each @xmath43 , called the _ multiplicity _ of @xmath39 in @xmath40 , is uniquely defined .",
    "thus @xmath39 occurs in @xmath40 as a subrepresentation iff the multiplicity @xmath43 is nonzero .",
    "let @xmath44 and @xmath45 denote the subspaces in @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively , of forms of degree @xmath48 .",
    "let @xmath49 denote the multiplicity of @xmath39 in @xmath45 .",
    "let @xmath50 denote the multiplicity of @xmath39 in @xmath44 .",
    "then @xmath39 is an obstruction for given @xmath22 and @xmath14 iff for some @xmath48 @xmath50 is nonzero but @xmath49 is zero . here",
    "@xmath48 is uniquely determined by the size @xmath51 of @xmath38 .",
    "we also say that @xmath39 is an _ obstruction of degree @xmath48 _ , and by an abuse of language , also that the label @xmath38 is an obstruction of degree @xmath48 .",
    "the main algebro - geometric result of @xcite ( theorem  [ tweaksft ] ) indicates that such obstructions should exist in the context of the @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 problem , when @xmath27 , assuming that @xmath3 , as we expect .",
    "the goal then is to show that obstructions indeed exist , as expected , for all @xmath28 , assuming @xmath27 .",
    "the story is similar for other related lower bound problems .",
    "this addresses the easier half of the flip from nonexistence to existence .      but",
    "how should one prove that obstructions actually exist ?",
    "the main hypothesis governing the flip , which addresses this question , is the following one that constitutes the harder half of the flip : from hard to easy .    *",
    "( phflip1 ) * [ hphflipintro ] consider the @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 problem over @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath20 be the explicit function in @xcite mentioned above .",
    "then the following problems are `` easy '' ; i.e. , belong to @xmath0 .",
    "specifically ,    \\(a ) * verification of an obstruction * : given @xmath22 , @xmath14 and the partition @xmath38 , whether @xmath39 is an obstruction for given @xmath22 and @xmath14 can be decided in @xmath52 time , where @xmath53 denotes the bitlength of the specification of @xmath38 .",
    "\\(b ) * explicit construction of obstructions * : suppose @xmath54 ( say ) .",
    "then , for every @xmath28 , a label @xmath55 of an obstruction @xmath39 for @xmath22 and @xmath14 can be constructed explicitly in @xmath56 time , thereby proving existence of an obstruction for every such @xmath22 and @xmath14 .    in view of the definition of an obstruction ,",
    "the statement ( a ) for verification clearly follows from :    [ hdecisionintro ] * ( phflip2 ) * the following the decision problems are easy ; i.e. , belong to @xmath0 .",
    "specifically ,    \\(a ) given @xmath57 and a partition @xmath38 , whether @xmath50 is nonzero , i.e. , whether @xmath39 occurs as a @xmath16-subrepresentation of @xmath58 can be decided in @xmath59 time . here",
    "@xmath60 denotes the bitlength of @xmath48 .",
    "\\(b ) given @xmath61 and a partition @xmath38 , whether @xmath49 is nonzero , i.e. , whether @xmath39 occurs as a @xmath16-subrepresentation of @xmath62 can be decided in @xmath63 time .",
    "the decision problems in hypothesis  [ hdecisionintro ] are the crux of the matter .",
    "once easy algorithms for these decision problems are found , the goal is to prove existence of an obstruction for every @xmath64 , when @xmath54 ( say ) , by constructing such an obstruction _ explicitly _ , as per hypothesis  [ hphflipintro ] ( b ) .",
    "we shall discuss how this is to done in section  [ sreductionintro ] below .",
    "assuming for the moment that this transformation of easy algorithms for the decision problems in hypothesis  [ hdecisionintro ] into an easy procedure for _ explicit construction of obstructions _",
    "( hypothesis  [ hphflipintro](b ) ) for all @xmath28 , when @xmath54 , works , we get the `` reduction '' shown in the top arrow of figure  [ fbasicintro ] : from the original hard nonexistence ( lower bound ) problem to the basic upper bound problems in hypothesis  [ hdecisionintro ] .",
    "but , by divine justice , the task of showing that the problems in hypothesis  [ hdecisionintro ] are easy turned out to be extremely hard .",
    "thus , paradoxically , the hardest aspect of the flip is just to prove that the basic decision problems that arise in the construction of obstructions are actually _ easy _ ; i.e. , belong to @xmath0 . the best algorithms for these decision problems obtained using the general purpose algorithms in algebraic geometry and representation",
    "theory take space that is double exponential in @xmath8 and time that is triple exponential in @xmath8 .",
    "this means even verification of an obstruction , let alone its discovery , takes time that is triple exponential in @xmath8 if one were to use the general purpose techniques .    the gap between this triple exponential time bound and the polynomial time bound sought in hypothesis  [ hdecisionintro ] is so huge that , at the surface , this hypothesis may seem impossible .",
    "this was the main barrier , called the @xmath0-barrier ( section  [ seasybarrier ] ) , on this path towards the @xmath0 vs @xmath1 problem when the flip was briefly announced in @xcite .",
    "the article @xcite says that it can be crossed under reasonable mathematical assumptions .",
    "we now turn to a brief description of these results .    for",
    "that we need a few definitions .",
    "we say that a function @xmath65 , @xmath66 a nonnegative integer , is a _ quasi - polynomial _ if",
    "for some integer @xmath67 there exist polynomials @xmath68 , @xmath69 , such that @xmath70 if @xmath71 modulo @xmath14 . here",
    "@xmath14 is called the period of the quasi - polynomial .",
    "an important example of a quasi - polynomial is the _",
    "ehrhart quasi - polynomial _",
    "@xmath72 of a polytope @xmath0 . by definition",
    ", it is the number of integer points in the dilated polytope @xmath73 .",
    "this is known to be a quasi - polynomial @xcite .",
    "we say that a quasi - polynomial @xmath65 is _ positive _ , if the coefficients of all @xmath68 are nonnegative .",
    "we say that it is _ saturated _ if either @xmath74 is identically zero as a polynomial , or if not , @xmath75 .",
    "if @xmath65 is positive , it is clearly saturated .",
    "next , let us associate with the multiplicities @xmath49 and @xmath50 the following stretching functions :    @xmath76    and @xmath77    the following is the main algebro - geometric result in @xcite .",
    "theorem 3.4.11 in @xcite ) [ tmainquasipolyintro ]    ( rationality hypothesis ) : assume that the singularities of the class varieties @xmath78 and @xmath79 are `` nice '' ( rational ) .    then the stretching functions @xmath80 and @xmath81 are quasi - polynomials",
    ".    we do not need to know the exact definition of a rational singularity here , which can be found in @xcite .",
    "it just means that the singularities are nice .",
    "this depends on the exceptional nature of the class varieties ( cf .",
    "section  [ sclass ] ) and is supported by the algebro - geometric results and arguments in @xcite .    using theorem  [ tmainquasipolyintro ] , we can now formulate the conjectural mathematical positivity hypotheses mentioned in the third box from above in figure  [ fbasicintro ] .",
    "assume the rationality hypothesis above .",
    "[ hph1genintro ] * ( ph1 : ) * the structural constant @xmath49 can be expressed as the number of integer points in a polytope @xmath82 of @xmath83 dimension , whose ehrhart quasi - polynomial coincides with the stretching quasi - polynomial @xmath80 in theorem  [ tmainquasipolyintro ] .",

    "there exists a polytope @xmath84 for the structural constant @xmath50 with similar properties .",

    "ph1 and sh ( ph2 ) together say that each decision problem in hypothesis  [ hdecisionintro ] can be transformed in polynomial time into a special kind of an integer programming problem called _ saturated ( resp .",
    "positive ) integer programming problem _ ( section  [ sgct6satpgm ] ) .",
    "[ tgct6intro ] ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) the decision problems in hypothesis  [ hdecisionintro ] are indeed in @xmath0 , assuming ph1 and sh ( or more strongly ph2 ) above .",
    "this follows from a polynomial time algorithm in @xcite for saturated ( positive ) integer programming .",
    "this result reduces the positive complexity - theoretic hypotheses in hypothesis  [ hdecisionintro ] to the mathematical positivity hypotheses ph1 and sh , as shown in the middle arrow in figure  [ fbasicintro ] . the algorithms in theorem  [ tgct6intro ] are conceptually extremely simple .",
    "they just need linear programming @xcite and computation of smith normal forms @xcite .",
    "but their correctness depends on the positivity hypotheses ph1 and sh ( ph2 ) , whose validity , in turn , is intimately linked to deep phenomena in algebraic geometry and the theory of quantum groups as we shall soon see .",
    "an indication of such a link is already here .",
    "since the proof of theorem  [ tmainquasipolyintro ] , which is necessary to even formulate these hypotheses , needs a few fundamental results in algebraic geometry ; namely , @xcite ( which in turn is based on @xcite and other results ) , and @xcite .",
    "it should not then be surprising if the proofs the hypotheses need far more .",
    "indeed , the quantum - group - theoretic and algebro - geometric machinery is needed in gct essentially to prove these hypotheses , and hence , that these extremely simple algorithms are actually correct .      but first , we need to justify why these hypotheses should hold in the first place . for that , let us consider the simplest analogue of the decision problems in hypothesis  [ hdecisionintro ] in representation theory :    ( littlewood - richardson problem ) [ plittleintro ] given partitions @xmath88 and @xmath38 , decide if the littlewood - richardson coefficient @xmath89 ( cf .",

    "the analogous mathematical positivity hypotheses in this setting are as follows .",
    "define the stretching function @xmath91 which is obtained by stretching the littlewood - richardson coefficient by a factor of @xmath66 .",
    "it is known to be a polynomial @xcite",
    ". then    [ htlittleph1 ] * ( ph1 ) * the littlewood - richardson coefficient @xmath89 can be expressed as the number of integer points in a polytope @xmath92 of dimension polynomial in the total length of @xmath88 and @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , the ehrhart quasi - polynomial of @xmath0 coincides with the stretching polynomial @xmath93 and the membership function of @xmath0 is computable in time that is polynomial in the bit lengths of @xmath88 and @xmath38 .",
    "this is shown , for example , in @xcite .",

    "second , this easy algorithm for discovering an obstruction , or rather its structure and the underlying techniques have to be used to prove that an obstruction always exists for every @xmath28 , assuming @xmath54 , say .",

    ", we can not hope to use the ellipsoid algorithm for linear programming  which though simple is intricate  for a constructive proof of existence of obstructions .",

    "but in the context of the ph1 that we are finally interested in ( hypothesis  [ hph1genintro ] ) the full power of ph0 seems needed for the plan in @xcite to work .    a natural approach to prove ph0 in @xcite in the context of this ph1 is to somehow generalize the proof of ph0 in the theory of the standard quantum group .",
    "but the theory of standard quantum groups does not work , as expected , in this context .",
    "the reason is briefly as follows .",
    "one can associate a complexity class with each structural constant that arises in gct , which we call its _ index class_. roughly , if a structural constant is associated with a class variety for a complexity class @xmath99 , then its index class is defined to @xmath99 . for example , the index classes of the multiplicities @xmath49 and @xmath50 are @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( over @xmath2 ) , since they are associated with @xmath0- and @xmath1-varieties , respectively .",
    "similarly , the index class of the littlewood - richardson coefficient is the class of circuits ( of restricted kinds ) of depth two ; cf . section  [ slittlegct6 ] . the index class of the _ kronecker coefficient _ ( section  [ stensor ] ) , which is the analogue of the littlewood - richardson coefficient in the representation theory of the symmetric group , is @xmath100 , the class of problems that can be solved by circuits of @xmath101 depth and polynomial size .",
    "the littlewood - richardson coefficient as well as the kronecker coefficient are special cases of the plethysm constants ( section  [ splethysmproblem ] ) which we mentioned earlier .",
    "the generalized plethysm constant is not associated with any class variety , but it is qualitatively similar to , though much simpler than @xmath50 .",
    "hence , we define its index class to be @xmath1 , with the understanding that this is to be taken only in a rough sense",
    ". the index classes of the structural constants here are not be confused with their usual computational complexity classes : they are all ( conjecturally ) in @xmath85 by ph1 .",
    "the standard quantum group is the quantum group that occurs in the context of ph1 for littlewood - richardson coefficients ( hypothesis  [ htlittleph1 ] ) .",
    "hence , we define its _ index class _ to be the same as that of littlewood - richardson coefficients , i.e. , the class of circuits of depth two .",
    "thus the standard quantum group is the quantum group attached to constant - depth ( depth - two ) circuits .    given a big difference between the lower bound problems for constant and nonconstant depth circuits , it should not be a surprise if the standard quantum group can not be used in the context of ph1 for the structural constants that actually arise in gct ; cf .",
    "section  [ sriemann ] for an intuitive mathematical explanation for why this is so .",
    "what is needed then are quantum groups that can play the role of the standard quantum group in the context of the decision problems and positivity hypotheses for these structural constants .",
    "the main result in this context is the following :    [ tquantumintro ]    @xcite there exists a quantum group , which is qualitatively similar to the standard quantum group , that can play such a role in the context of the kronecker coefficients .",
    "@xcite more generally , there exists a ( possibly singular ) quantum group that can play such a role in the context of the generalized plethysm constants .",
    "a less informal statement will be given later ( theorem  [ tnonstdquantum ] ) .",
    "a conjectural scheme for generalizing these quantum groups to the ones that can play such a role in the context of @xmath102 and other structural constants in gct is suggested in @xcite .",
    "we shall call the new quantum groups in theorem  [ tquantumintro ] _ nonstandard _ , because , though they are qualitatively similar to the standard quantum group , they are also fundamentally different , as expected .",
    "thus , standard corresponds to constant depth and nonstandard to nonconstant depth circuits .",
    "the article @xcite gives a conjecturally correct algorithm to construct canonical bases of the irreducible representations and coordinate rings of the nonstandard quantum groups in @xcite with the required positivity properties ( ph0 ) .",
    "these are natural generalizations of the canonical basis due to kashiwara and lusztig @xcite mentioned above for the irreducible representations and the coordinate ring of the standard quantum group .",
    "@xcite also gives a conjecturally correct algorithm to construct canonical bases with similar positivity properties ( ph0 ) for the nonstandard deformations of the symmtric group algebra that are dually paired with the nonstandard quantum groups ",
    "these generalize the kazhdan - lusztig basis @xcite of the hecke algebra .",
    "it is also shown in @xcite that ph1 for the plethysm constants follows from ph0 and other conjectural properties of these nonstandard canonical bases and quantum objects .",
    "the story for the general constants @xmath50 and @xmath49 can be expected to be similar @xcite .    at present",
    "we can neither prove correctness of the algorithms in @xcite for constructing nonstandard canonical bases nor the required conjectural properties for the reasons that we shall describe in a moment .",
    "but a considerable evidence is given in @xcite in support of ph0 for the nonstandard quantum group in @xcite . in the standard case , ph1 follows from ph0 in a more or less rigid way @xcite .",
    "this means the polytope that occurs in ph1 for the littlewood - richardson coefficient ( hypothesis  [ htlittleph1 ] ) is more or less determined by the canonical basis for the standard quantum group  not completely , since there are a few choices for this polytope ; e.g. a hive polytope in @xcite , or a polytope in @xcite . but all these choices are intimately related .",
    "a common feature is that they all have extremely regular structures .",
    "the same can be expected for the polytopes that should arise in the nonstandard setting .",
    "this regularity is crucial for the final transformation of easy algorithms for the basic decision problems in hypothesis  [ hdecisionintro ] into easy algorithms for explicit construction of obstructions ; cf .",
    "sections  [ sreductionintro ] and [ sreduction ] .",
    "existence of nonstandard quantum groups of polylogarithmic @xcite and superpolynomial @xcite depth complexity , the conjecturally correct algorithm in @xcite for constructing canonical bases ( ph0 ) of their coordinate rings and irreducible representations , and the principle that is suggested by the theory of standard quantum groups ",
    "namely , once a canonical basis is there ( ph0 ) , everything else in the story more or less follows a rigid path  is the main reason why gct may be expected to deliver lower bounds for circuits of superpolynomial depth and size eventually .",
    "but for this plan to work , ph0 for the nonstandard quantum groups has to be proved .",
    "this brings us to the main open question in this story : how can we prove correctness of the algorithm in @xcite for constructing the canonical bases ( ph0 ) of the coordinate rings of the nonstandard quantum groups ?    there are two constructions of the canonical basis in the standard setting . an algebraic construction in @xcite , where it is called global crystal basis , and a topological construction in @xcite .",
    "both constructions give rise to the same basis @xcite .",
    "in fact , both constructions follow the same basic scheme .",
    "only the proofs of correctness of this basic scheme are different . the topological proof is based on the theory of perverse sheaves @xcite , which in turn , is based on riemann hypothesis over finite fields @xcite .",
    "in essence , ph0 is thus ultimately deduced in the topological proof from the riemann hypothesis over finite fields , which is again a deep positive statement . because its usual statement is , after all , a positive statement , and",
    "it can also be reformulated as stipulating positivity ( nonnegativity ) of some mathematical quantities ( cf . page 458 in @xcite ) .",
    "the topological proof also gives , as a side product , the only known proof of nonnegativity of the structural constants associated with the canonical basis in the standard setting .",
    "though this nonnegativity is not needed for proving ph1 for the littlewood - richardson coefficients , it is crucial in the nonstandard setting for the reasons given in @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the topological approach seems to be the only viable option in the nonstandard setting , as far as we can see .",
    "besides , the algebraic complexity of the nonstandard quantum groups is so huge  as to be expected in view of the huge gap between constant and nonconstant depth circuits  that a purely algebraic proof of correctness of the algorithm in @xcite for constructing canonical bases in the nonstandard setting seems difficult .",
    "but the standard riemann hypothesis over finite fields and the related techniques can not be expected to work in the the nonstandard setting for the reasons given in @xcite . again",
    "this should not be surprising given the big difference between constant and nonconstant depth circuits . hence what seem to be needed @xcite to make the topological approach work in the nonstandard setting are _ nonstandard extensions _ of the riemann hypothesis over finite fields and the related work on perverse sheaves . by nonstandard ,",
    "we mean the extensions that will work in the context of the nonstandard quantum groups .",
    "the author does not have the mathematical expertize to even formulate such hypotheses , let alone prove them .",
    "but the theoretical and experimental evidence in @xcite ( cf .",
    "section  [ sriemann ] ) suggests that such extensions exist , and that they ought to be provable by a systematic extension of the theory of standard quantum groups to the nonstandard setting .",
    "hence it is reasonable to hope that the experts would be able to do so eventually , leading to the proof of ph0 hypotheses along the topological lines , and finally , to the explicit construction of obstructions as outlined above , which would then imply that @xmath5 over @xmath2 .",
    "the whole picture is summarized in figure  [ fgct6 ] , which is an elaboration of the earlier figure  [ fbasicintro ] .",
    "the arrows with question marks are conjectural , the double arrows are unconditional .",
    "signs indicate the main open problems at the heart of this approach .",
    "the story over @xmath2 may eventually lift to the story over finite fields along lines suggested in @xcite .",
    "@xmath103      an initial motivation for going for explicit construction of obstructions as in figure  [ fgct6 ] was provided by explicit construction of expanders @xcite . as explained in section  [ sobsvsexp ] ,",
    "the obstructions in gct are in a certain sense generalizations of the expanders from constant depth to superpolynomial depth circuits .",
    "specifically , obstructions are to superpolynomial depth circuits what expanders are to constant depth , in fact , depth two circuits ; cf . figure  [ fobsvsexpintro ] . in view of this relationship",
    ", explicit construction of obstructions as in figure  [ fgct6 ] would be in the setting of superpolynomial depth circuits what explicit construction of expanders is in the setting of constant depth circuits . as we remarked earlier",
    ", the standard quantum group also corresponds to circuits of depth two .",
    "that is , expanders and the standard quantum group both correspond to the class of depth - two circuits .",
    "hence it does not seem to be a coincidence that the riemann hypothesis over finite fields , which enters in the theory of the standard quantum group , also enters in the theory of expanders @xcite .",
    "@xmath104    existence of expanders can be proved by a simple probabilistic method .",
    "in contrast , existence of expanders may not be provable by a probabilistic method .",
    "indeed , this is roughly the main content of @xcite , which says that a nonconstructive method , such as a probabilistic method , should not work in the context of the @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 problem under reasonable assumptions .",
    "this is why in gct we go for explicit construction of obstructions in the spirit of explicit construction of expanders .",
    "the @xmath105-naturalizability barrier in @xcite should not be applicable to such explicit , constructive proof techniques .",
    "this issue is addressed in more detail in section  [ snatural ] .",
    "finally , one may ask if the @xmath3 conjecture may be proved by a substantially simpler proof technique .",
    "this seems unlikely for the following reasons .",
    "the results in complexity theory such as @xcite suggest that explicit constructions may be more or less essential for derandomization . in conjunction with the hardness vs. randomness principle @xcite , this suggests that explicit constructions may also be more or less essential for ( the difficult ) lower bound problems as well .",
    "hence , the difficulty in any viable proof technique for the @xmath3 conjecture may be intimately linked to the difficulty ( complexity ) of the explicit construction of obstructions , i.e. , `` proofs of hardness '' as per that technique .",
    "this may be so regardless of whether the technique actually constructs such obstructions explicitly or not .",
    "because , as per the existence - vs - construction principle @xcite , the difficulty of deciding existence may be more or less the same as that of construction in natural problems . these and other considerations naturally lead to a notion of _ explicit construction complexity _ of an _ easy - to - verify _ proof technique towards the @xmath3 conjecture , where easy - to - verify formally means @xmath0-verifiable ; cf .",
    "section  [ spveri ] .",
    "the explicit construction ( depth ) complexity of expanders is o(1 ) , in fact , two , since they can be constructed by ( nonuniform ) depth - two algebraic circuits ( over a ring of integers modulo @xmath66 for some @xmath66 ) @xcite .",
    "whereas , as per hypothesis  [ hphflipintro ] , the explicit construction ( depth ) complexity of the obstructions in gct over @xmath2 is @xmath106 , @xmath107 ( say ) being the circuit size parameter in the lower bound problem ; cf .",
    "figure  [ fobsvsexpintro ] .",
    "the arguments in section  [ spveri ] suggest that this may be essentially the best explicit construction complexity that one can expect in any @xmath0-verifiable proof technique towards the @xmath3 conjecture . in other words , the massive @xmath108 gap between the explicit construction complexity of obstructions and the @xmath109 explicit construction complexity of expanders , as shown in figure  [ fobsvsexpintro ] , may be inevitable in any @xmath0-verifiable proof technique towards the @xmath3 conjecture .",

    "section  [ spbarrierintro ] ) , if @xmath0 is nonempty .",
    "we allow @xmath8 , the number of constraints , to be exponential in @xmath22 .",
    "hence , we can not assume that @xmath445 and @xmath447 are explicitly specified .",
    "rather , it is assumed that the polytope @xmath0 is specified in the form of a ( polynomial - time ) separation oracle as in @xcite .",
    "given a point @xmath450 , the separation oracle tells if @xmath451 , and if not , gives a hyperplane that separates @xmath452 from @xmath0 .",
    "the following is the main complexity - theoretic result in @xcite .",
    "[ tgct6sat ] a saturated , and hence positive , integer programming problem has an oracle - polynomial - time algorithm .",

    "it is essentially a variant of linear programming : it uses a generalization of the ellipsoid method @xcite for linear programming in @xcite , and a polynomial time algorithm for computing smith normal forms in @xcite .",
    "thus the saturated and positive integer programming paradigm , in essence , says that linear programming works for integer programming provided the saturation or the positivity property holds .",
    "theorem  [ tmaincomplexity ] follows from theorem  [ tmainquasipoly ] because ph1 and sh ( ph2 ) ( cf .",
    "hypotheses  [ hph1genintro]-[hshgenintro ] ) imply that the decision problems in hypothesis  [ hdecision ] can be transformed in polynomial time into saturated ( positive ) integer programming problems .",

    "for example , even to state ph1 , sh or ph2 , we need to show that the stretching functions used in their statements are quasi - polynomials , as shown in theorem  [ tmainquasipoly ] . without it , ph1 , sh and ph2 are meaningless .",
    "but the proof of theorem  [ tmainquasipoly ] already depends on nontrivial machinery in algebraic geometry ; e.g. the cohomology vanishing result in @xcite , and the result in @xcite , which , in turn , needs resolution of singularities in characteristic zero @xcite and other cohomology vanishing results .",
    "hence it should not be surprising if proving these positivity hypotheses needs far more .",
    "we shall describe the basic plan in @xcite for proving them later ( sections  [ snonstdquantum]-[sriemann ] ) .",
    "but , first , we have to explain why ph1 and ph2 should hold in the first place .",
    "this depends , as mentioned earlier , on the exceptional nature of @xmath12 and @xmath20 .",

    "let @xmath462 be the associated group triple .",

    "for the sake of simplicity , let us assume that the quasi - polynomials in theorem  [ tmainquasipoly ] are actually polynomials ; i.e. , their periods are one , though this is not expected . in that case , it can be shown that @xcite ph1 and sh imply that there exist polytopes @xmath505 and @xmath506 of @xmath56 dimensions such that an obstruction for @xmath386 and the pair @xmath388 exists iff the relative difference @xmath507 is nonempty , and furthermore , an explicit obstruction can also be constructed in polynomial time once we are given a rational point in @xmath508 .",

    "a polynomial time algorithm for their existence and construction may be designed along the lines we just described .",

    "let us imagine that @xmath509 is empty , so that @xmath512 is a polytope , and that it is the perfect - matching polytope of a bipartite graph @xmath513 .",
    "then @xmath508 is nonempty iff @xmath513 has a perfect matching , which can be thought of as an obstruction in this analogy .",
    "the analogous goal then is to show using the techniques and structure underlying the hungarian method that @xmath513 always has a perfect matching , as expected , when @xmath54 , and @xmath333 . in other words",
    ", we have to give a @xmath0-constructive proof for existence of a perfect matching in every such @xmath513 . in this analogy ,",
    "the technique underneath the hungarian method can be easily used to give a constructive proof of hall s marriage theorem ",
    "namely , that every bipartite graph @xmath254 in which every subset , on any side of the graph , has at least as many neighbours as the size of that subset has a perfect matching  which then has to be used to show that @xmath513 always has a perfect matching whenever @xmath54 , @xmath28 .    now in our setting @xmath508 is not a perfect matching polytope .",
    "but if it has a nice structure like the perfect matching polytope then it should be possible to prove structure theorems in the spirit of hall s marriage theorem for @xmath508 using the structure of the hungarian - type greedy algorithm for deciding nonemptyness of @xmath508 and then use it to prove nonemptyness of @xmath508 , for every @xmath28 , when @xmath54 .    for such a transformation of a polynomial time algorithm for discovery into a @xmath0-constructive proof of existence to work ,",
    "it is crucial that :    1 .",
    "the polyhedral set @xmath508 has a nice , regular structure like the perfect matching polytope .",
    "fortunately , the polytopes @xmath511 and @xmath514 that would arise in our setting should be even nicer than the perfect matching polytope .",
    "for example , in the simpler setting of the littlewood - richardson problem ( problem  [ plittle ] ) , @xmath511 and @xmath509 become littlewood - richardson cones @xcite , which have extremely regular structure with remarkable representation - theoretic and algebro - geometric properties @xcite . the same is expected to be the case for the actual @xmath511 and @xmath509 .",
    "the algorithm for discovery not only works in polynomial time , but also has a simple structure like the hungarian method .",
    "the hungarian - type greedy algorithms that we expect for the problems under consideration should have such structures .",
    "hence , it is reasonable to expect that an easy hungarian - type algorithm for deciding nonemptyness of @xmath508 can be transformed into the sought @xmath0-constructive proof of obstructions .",
    "the story is expected to be similar , albeit much harder , when the quasi - polynomials in theorem  [ tmainquasipoly ] have nontrivial periods ; cf @xcite .",
    "the above scheme for the transformation of an algorithm for discovery into a constructive proof of existence banks on the fact that the algorithm to be transformed is easy , i.e. , works in polynomial time , besides having a simple structure .",
    "the underlying informal principle , which can not be proved , is that the mathematical complexity of an algorithmic ( constructive ) proof is intimately linked to the computational complexity of the algorithm on which it is based ; see section  [ spveri ] for a detailed treatment of this issue .",
    "this is why there is no nontrivial result , comparable to hall s theorem , for hamiltonian paths . because the problem of finding such a path is np - complete .",
    "the reader may wonder why we are talking about explicit construction of obstructions , when , strictly speaking , we only need to know their existence .",
    "this is because the nature of obstructions in our case is such that their explicit construction , if they exist , can be done with only a little additional cost over the cost of deciding existence . to see this ,",
    "let us again assume , for the sake of simplicity , that the quasi - polynomials in theorem  [ tmaincomplexity ] are polynomials .",
    "then a technique that can decide nonemptiness of @xmath508 should also be able to compute a point in it , as a proof of nonemptiness , at only a little additional cost , just as in linear programming .",
    "in other words , the complexity of deciding existence of an obstruction should be more or less the same as that of constructing it , if it exists .",
    "this is why we mainly talk of explicit construction of obstructions though , in principle , just their existence would suffice .",
    "our discussion so far says that ph1 and sh ( ph2 ) are the crux of the matter .",
    "if they can be proved , and explicit descriptions of the polytopes therein become available , it should be possible to transform the easy algorithms in theorem  [ tmaincomplexity ] into an easy algorithm for explicit construction of obstructions as per hypothesis  [ hphflipformalnew ] ( b ) .",
    "now we proceed to the basic plan in @xcite for proving ph1 and sh .",

    "we describe that story in this section .    for this",
    "we need the notion of a standard quantum group , by which we mean the quantum group in @xcite .",
    "we can not formally define here this object , but we can at least give an intuitive idea .",

    "its precise description is given in @xcite .",
    "we do not need that here .",
    "let us just think of a quantum group as what a group becomes when the coordinates become noncommuting .",
    "let us now explain how quantum groups enter in the story of littlewood - richardson coefficients .",
    "this is because the most transparent proof of the littlewood - richardson rule came via the theory of quantum groups @xcite .",

    "this is essentially so .",
    "that is , it holds in a certain dual setting  this is the main result in @xcite .",
    "thus the theory of quantum group can be regarded as the theory of the quantization @xmath526 .    once this theory is developed sufficiently , the littlewood - richardson rule as well as ph1 for littlewood - richardson coefficients ( hypothesis  [ htlittleph1 ] ) turn out to be a consequence , in a nontrivial way , of a deep positivity result in the theory of the standard quantum groups @xcite : namely , their representations and coordinate rings have _ canonical _ bases , also called global crystal bases , whose structural constants , which determine their multiplicative and representation theoretic structure , are all nonnegative . for this reason , we say that the canonical bases are _ positive _ , and refer to existence of a canonical basis as a positivity property ( hypothesis ) ph0 .",

    "in other words , nonnegativity of the structural constants associated with @xmath524 is connected at a profound level with the lining up of the zeros of the zeta functions of some algebraic varieties on one axis .",

    ", from the circuits of height two that the littlewood - richardson problem corresponds to to the circuits of superpolynomial height that the decision problems in hypothesis  [ hdecision ] correspond to .",
    "roughly , it goes as follows :    \\(1 ) * quantization : * quantize the couples @xmath560 and the triples @xmath561 associated with the class varieties in a manner akin to the quantization ( [ eqdiagq ] ) of ( [ eqdiaglittle ] ) via standard quantum groups .",
    "\\(2 ) * ph0 for couples and triples : * prove that the coordinate rings and representations of the quantum groups that arise in this quantization have canonical bases akin to the canonical bases for the standard quantum groups whose structure constants , which determine their multiplicative and representation theoretic structure , are all nonnegative .",

    "let us begin with the first step of quantization .",
    "we shall only worry about the couples . to be concrete ,",
    "let @xmath563 be as in problem  [ pgct6subgroup ] , where @xmath254 is connected , reductive subgroup of @xmath16 .",
    "quantization of this couple is the crux of the problem .",
    "all other quantizations that are needed are hyped up versions of this , so we shall only concentrate on this .",
    "the standard theory of quantum groups can not be used for quantizing this couple , as expected .",
    "specifically , let @xmath535 be the standard quantum group associated with @xmath16 . in a similar fashion , one can associate @xcite a standard quantum group @xmath524 with @xmath254 . then",

    "this quantization step is addressed in the following result for the couples in problems  [ pgct6kronecker]-[pgct6plethysm ] , which are the main prototypes of the couples that arise in gct .",

    "@xmath254 can even be any connected classical reductive group .",
    "the nonstandard quantum group in @xcite is qualitatively similar to the standard quantum group in @xcite in the sense that it has a maximal quantum unitary subgroup just as in the the standard case .",
    "this , in conjunction with work in @xcite , allows the mathematical machinery related to unitariness  such as harmonic analysis , existence of orthonormal bases  to be transported to its theory .",
    "this is important in the context of ph0 .",
    "indeed , ph0 in the theory of standard quantum groups is intimately related to existence of unitary quantum subgroups . because the local crystal bases for representations of the standard quantum group @xcite , which were later globalized to canonical ( global crystal ) bases in @xcite , arose in the study of special orthonormal gelfand - tsetlin bases for representations of the standard quantum group .",
    "this is first main reason why ph0 is expected to hold for the nonstandard quantum group in @xcite .",
    "the general nonstandard quantum group @xcite can be singular , i.e. , its quantum determinant can vanish .",
    "hence , we can not define its quantum unitary subgroup in the sense of @xcite .",
    "fortunately , this is not matter , because analogues of the main required results in @xcite still hold ; cf .",
    "@xcite for a precise statement .",
    "hence ph0 is expected to hold for the general nonstandard quantum groups in @xcite as well .",
    "but at the same time these nonstandard quantum groups are fundamentally different from the standard quantum groups . hence the terminology nonstandard . for a detailed description of the differences between the standard and nonstandard quantum groups , see @xcite . here",
    "we only give a brief description from the complexity - theoretic perspective . towards this end , we associate a complexity level with each of these quantum groups .",

    "hence , the standard quantum group corresponds to the complexity class of problems that can be solved by circuits of depth two using only additions or multiplications by constants , just like expanders ( section  [ sobsvsexp ] ) .",
    "there is no lower bound problem here to speak of .",
    "that is why the standard quantum group can not be used for deriving any lower bound , again like expanders .",
    "the couple associated with the kronecker problem coincides with the primary couple @xmath572 associated with the @xmath304-class variety ; cf .",
    "( [ eqdetstab ] ) . not exactly .",
    "the primary couple associated with the @xmath304-variety is slightly different from this , but the difference is trivial , and can be ignored .",
    "theory of the nonstandard quantum group in theorem  [ tnonstdquantum ] ( a ) is the theory of quantization of this couple .",
    "hence , the complexity class of this nonstandard quantum group can be defined to be @xmath304 .",
    "the couple ( [ eqquantumpl ] ) that is quantized in @xcite is not a primary couple of any class variety .",
    "but it is qualitatively similar to the primary couple associated with the @xmath1-class - variety ( section  [ spvsnp ] ) . for this reason",
    ", the nonstandard quantum group in @xcite can be roughly taken to be of superpolynomial complexity .",
    "the article @xcite gives a conjecturally correct algorithm to construct canonical bases of the coordinate rings of the nonstandard quantum groups in @xcite .",
    "these are natural generalizations of the canonical basis in @xcite for the coordinate ring of the standard quantum group .",
    "further theoretical and experimental evidence in support of ph0 for the nonstandard quantum group in @xcite is also given .",
    "for the problems that have to be addressed in the context of the triples associated with the class varieties under consideration , see @xcite .",
    "since the group - theoretic class varieties are essentially determined by the associated group triples , once ph0 is proved for the triples , it should , in priciple , be possible to `` transport '' this knowledge from group theory to algebraic geometry , thereby proving ph0 for the class varieties . in @xcite",
    "is basic plan for this `` transport '' is suggested , with a description of the various mathematical problems that need to be resolved .",
    "a crucial bridge between group theory and algebraic geometry for this transport is provided by conjecture  [ csftclass ] , which has to be proved first .",
    "it may be remarked that quantum groups were indeed brought into gct precisely for the purpose of proving this conjecture , thereby extending the proof in @xcite for its weaker form ( theorem  [ tweaksft ] ) . a basic plan for this extension via nonstandard quantum groups",
    "is also suggested in @xcite .",
    "the journey from ph0 to ph1 in the nonstandard setting should be akin to the one in the standard setting ; cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in summary , the nonstandard quantum groups have to be used as a rope , as it were , to pull the proofs of the various mathematical positivity hypotheses from the constant depth ( of the standard quantum groups ) to superpolynomial depth .",
    "now we come to the final chapter of this story : how to prove ph0 , and specifically , correctness of the algorithm in @xcite for constructing canonical bases of the coordinate rings of the nonstandard quantum groups in @xcite and their required conjectural properties .    for the standard quantum group ,",
    "as we mentioned in section  [ sintro ] , the topological proof in @xcite depends on the riemann hypothesis over finite fields @xcite and the related work @xcite .",
    "the main open problem at the heart of gct is to extend this work , and use it to prove nonstandard ph0 .",
    "but the standard riemann hypothesis over finite fields is not expected to work in the nonstandard setting ; cf .",
    "@xcite . briefly this is because the relevant quantized noncommutative algebraic varieties in the nonstandard setting simply `` disappear '' when specialized at @xmath553 . specifically , unlike in the standard case , the hilbert function of these varieties at @xmath573 is different from the hilbert function of the corresponding classical varieties at @xmath553 .",
    "hence , they look very different from the classical algebraic varieties . this is why the riemann hypothesis over finite fields may not be used as in the standard case for proving ph0 .",
    "thus we seem to need nonstandard extensions of the riemann hypothesis over finite fields in the quantized noncommutative setting to prove the ph0 s under consideration .",
    "we can not even formulate such extensions .",
    "but we believe such nonstandard extensions exist .",
    "we now briefly explain why .    for this",
    ", we need to indicate the nature of the experimental evidence @xcite in support of ph0 for the most basic nonstandard quantum group for the kronecker problem in @xcite .",
    "specifically , around a thousand structural constants associated with a canonical basis for a certain dual of this quantum group were computed , each structural constant being a polynomial in @xmath547 of degree more than ten .",
    "all the coefficients of these structural polynomials turned out be nonnegative . in the standard case ,",
    "the cause for such nonnegativity was the riemann hypothesis over finite fields .",
    "there ought to be a similar theoretical cause for nonnegativity in the nonstandard setting .",
    "for , without a cause , the probability of over ten thousand coefficients being nonnegative would be absurdly small  naively @xmath574 .",
    "this estimate , being naive , should not be taken literally .",
    "but it does suggest that the experimental evidence for positivity should only be a shadow of the ultimate cause ",
    "nonstandard analogues of the riemann hypotheses over finite fields .",
    "this leads us to believe that nonstandard extensions of the riemann hypothesis over finite fields for the various nonstandard quantum groups that arise in gct exist , and now , having seen the shadow , we have to search for the ultimate cause whose shadow it is .",
    "if this search succeeds , then we can expect to pull the proofs of ph0 from the standard to the nonstandard setting , using the rope provided by the nonstandard quantum groups , and the power provided by nonstandard riemann hypotheses , thereby leading to the proof of @xmath5 conjecture in characteristic zero ; cf .",
    "figure  [ fgct6 ] .",
    "eventually , this whole story in characteristic zero , along with the nonstandard riemann hypotheses and the accompanying positivity hypotheses , may be lifted , as suggested in @xcite , to algebraically closed fields of positive characteristic , and finally , finite fields , thereby proving the @xmath3 conjecture in its usual form .",
    "this would then constitute the ultimate flip in figure  [ fgctultimate ] .",
    "we now explain the relationship between explicit construction of obstructions and explicit construction of expanders as shown in figure  [ fobsvsexpintro ] .    as per the hardness - vs - randomness principle @xcite , derandomization",
    "is intimately linked to lower bound problems . in particular , restricted kinds of lower bounds follow from existence of efficient pseudo - random generators . at present",
    ", we do not have pseudo - random generators based on expander - like structures that can yield a lower bound result for constant depth circuits .",
    "but for the sake of discussion , let us imagine that the expander in , say , @xcite can be generalized further to obtain a hypothetical structure , which we shall call a _",
    "strong expander _ , using which we can obtain an efficient pseudo - random generator , whose existence , in turn , implies separation of the class @xmath575 from @xmath576 . here",
    "@xmath575 is the class of problems that can be solved by circuits of logarithmic depth , and @xmath576 the class of problems that can be solved by circuits of constant depth .",
    "furthermore , let us also assume that the problem of constructing such a strong expander belongs to ( nonuniform , algebraic ) @xmath576 , as it does for the expander in @xcite .",
    "now the existence of such a family @xmath577 of strong expanders would imply that an explicit function in @xmath575 , depending on the pseudo - random generator , cannnot be computed by a circuit of constant depth .",
    "hence such strong expanders can be regarded as obstructions , i.e. proofs of hardness , for computation of an explicit @xmath575-function by constant - depth circuits . in this sense gct obstructions",
    "are to superpolynomial - depth circuits are what strong expanders are to constant - depth circuits .",
    "this is pictorially depicted in figure  [ fobsvsexp ] .",
    "@xmath578    the expander in @xcite can actually be constructed by a nonuniform algebraic circuit of depth two ( a basic ring operation is taken as unit cost ) .",
    "hence , it can be expected to serve as an obstruction for computation by a circuit of depth at most two  really , just one . because the depth of a circuit for computing an explicit structure whose existence separates @xmath304 from ( nonuniform ) @xmath579 ,",
    "the class of circuits of depth @xmath66 , should be at least @xmath66really higher than @xmath66 .",
    "so an expander , as against the hypothetical strong expander , actually belongs to depth - two circuits .",
    "but there is no nontrivial lower bound problem for circuits of depth one .",
    "this is why the expanders that we have at present can not be used in lower bound problems .",
    "now let us compare explicit construction of expanders with the suggested method for explicit construction of obstructions in figure  [ fgct6 ] .",
    "first , let us observe that , though the explicit construction of expanders @xcite is `` extremely easy '' ( nonuniform @xmath576 ) , its correctness is based on a nontrivial mathematical positivity hypothesis :    * phspectral : * the spectral gap of an expander is bounded below by a positive constant .    the mathematical positivity hypotheses ph1 and ph2 ( hypothesis  [ hph1genintro]-[hshgenintro ] ) can be regarded as nonspectral analogues of phspectral in the setting of superpolynomial depth circuits .",
    "second , the proof of phspectral in @xcite for expanders depends on the riemann hypothesis over finite fields ( for curves ) @xcite .",
    "it should not be a surprise then that what is needed to prove the positivity hypotheses ph1 , sh ( ph2 ) mentioned above is , in essence , an extension of the riemann hypothesis over finite fields and the results surrounding it . but given the big gap between constant depth and superpolynomial depth circuits it would have been a great surprise if the existing standard riemann hypothesis over finite field were to suffice .",
    "instead , what seems to be needed are nonstandard extensions of the riemann hypothesis over finite fields , and the related results ; cf .",
    "section  [ sriemann ] . in the case of expanders ,",
    "the riemann hypothesis over finite fields is not indispensible , since there are alternative constructions of expanders with proofs of correctness based on linear algebra @xcite .",
    "but , again given a big gap between constant depth and superpolynomial depth , it should not be surprising if nonstandard extensions of the riemann hypothesis turn out to be indispensible in the context of the @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 problem .",
    "in this section we point out why the flip should be nonrelativizable and non-@xmath105-naturalizable .",
    "we already mentioned one reason for why the flip should be nonrelativizable : namely , the `` reduction '' from hard nonexistence to easy existence is not a formal turing machine reduction .",
    "there is also another reason . for this , let us examine why the proof of @xmath580 result @xcite does not seem relativizable . mainly because it is based on the construction of an explicit low - degree polynomial",
    "this seems already enough to make it nonrelativizable , though the proof technique is not fully explicit .",
    "( because it makes use of estimates on the number of roots of a low degree polynomial .",
    "any technique based on counting or estimates is , by definition , not fully explicit ) .",
    "in contrast , the flip is to be implemented using explicit algebro - geometric and representation - theoretic constructions .",
    "this is why it should be nonrelativizable .",
    "now we turn to the @xmath105-naturalizability barrier @xcite . intuitively ,",
    "this too should be crossed simply because everything is to be done explicitly and constructively .",
    "recall that explicit construction of obstructions is for superpolynomial depth circuits what explicit construction of expanders is for depth - two circuits ( section  [ sobsvsexp ] ) .",
    "the usual probabilistic ( nonconstructive ) proof for existence of expanders may be considered to be @xmath105-naturalizable  as the probabilistic proofs @xcite of lower bounds for constant depth circuits  whereas the proof via explicit construction in @xcite may be considered non-@xmath105-naturalizable .",
    "this is only an analogy . strictly speaking ,",
    "there is no notion of @xmath105-naturalization for constant depth circuits .",
    "rather , this barrier lies between the circuits of constant depth to which the expanders correspond and the circuits of superpolynomial depth to which the obstructions correspond . but",
    "this analogy should intuitively explain why the flip should cross this barrier .",
    "now we turn to a more formal argument .",
    "we begin by recalling the notion of a @xmath105-naturalizable proof @xcite .",
    "we use the formal term @xmath105-naturalizable proof instead of the informal term natural proof , because otherwise gct , and hence , the algebro - geometric and quantum - group - theoretic techniques that enter into it would have to be called unnatural . that may seem paradoxical , especially since quantum groups arose in the study of natural phenomena in theoretical physics .",
    "let @xmath581 be the set of @xmath22-variable boolean functions . by a _ property _ of boolean functions , we mean a family of subsets @xmath582 for every @xmath22 .",

    "the article @xcite says that the @xmath3 conjecture would not have a @xmath105-naturalizable proof under reasonable assumptions .",
    "next , we translate this notion to the setting wherein the base field @xmath397 of computation is algebraically closed , as in this article .",
    "we assume that @xmath587 or @xmath588 , the algebraic closure of a finite field @xmath589 .",
    "let @xmath581 be the set of @xmath22-variable polynomials of degree @xmath590 for some fixed function @xmath591 .",

    "hence we let it play the role of the truth - table - size in what follows .",
    "this leads to the following straightforward generalization of the notion of a @xmath105-naturalizable proof over @xmath2 or @xmath595 .    by a property , we now mean a subset @xmath596 , for each @xmath22 .",
    "it is called useful if the circuit size over @xmath397 of any function @xmath597 is super - polynomial",

    "* largeness * : latexmath:[\\[\\label{eqlarge2 }     a proof technique based on a useful @xmath105-natural property is called @xmath105-naturalizable .",

    "but the constructivity and largeness constraints over algebraically closed fields here are natural extensions of the ones over finite field .",
    "hence , we shall assume in what follows that they are meaningful even over algebraically closed fields .",
    "it would be interesting to know if the techniques in @xcite can be lifted in some form to such fields .    in the context of the flip , we next formulate a property which is conjecturally useful and which should violate both the largeness and the constructivity constraints .",
    "this should be enough to cross the @xmath105-naturalizability barrier .",
    "let us follow the notation as in section  [ sclass ] .",

    "if the pseudo - random generator is based on an explicit structure in the spirit of an expander , then this structure too can be considered to be an obstruction .",
    "more generally , the hardness - vs - randomness principle @xcite suggests that proof techniques for difficult lower bounds may need more or less explicit constructions of some structures",
    ". these structures , which serve as witnesses for hardness , can then be taken as obstructions .    in the rest of this section ,",
    "we confine ourselves only to those techniques towards the @xmath3 conjecture which contain , explicitly or implicitly , the notion of an obstruction in this spirit  a witness for hardness  which admits a well - defined description that can be assigned bit length .",

    "specifically , takes time that is polynomial in @xmath620 and the bit length of the obstruction .",
    "the meaning of easy here is the most obvious and natural definition in the context of the @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 problem .",
    "thus , intuitively a @xmath0-verifiable proof technique is an _ easy - to - verify _ proof technique .",
    "that is , the problem of discovering a proof of hardness ( obstruction ) in the technique belongs to @xmath1 .",
    "the definition above makes sense over any base field @xmath397 of computation , with obvious modifications in the spirit of the ones in section  [ snatural ] .",
    "first , the usual experience in mathematics suggests that however hard the discovery of a proof may be its verification , once found , should be easy , and furthermore , the proofs that are found are usually reasonably short . in the definition of @xmath0-verifiability ,",
    "short and easy are given the most obvious and natural interpretations in the context of the @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 problem : description of polynomial size ( short ) , and can be done in polynomial time ( easy ) .",

    "a @xmath0-verifiable proof technique is better than it as per the most obvious complexity measures : ( 1 ) space ( short ) , and ( 2 ) time ( cost of verification ) .",
    "third , the article @xcite roughly says that a nonspecific approach that is applicable to a large fraction of hard functions should not work in the context of the @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 problem .",
    "thus approaches based on probabilistic methods or estimates of various kinds  such as bezout - type estimates in algebraic geometry , or estimates for discrepancies and deviations in analysis or number theory  should not work .",
    "proof of hardness as per any such approach  namely , the value of the measure or the estimate which is the cause of hardness  should be hard to verify .",
    "since to verify the value , we may have to compute it and see that it really tallies with what is given , and such computations should typically take time that is exponential in the bitlength of the value .",

    "one can ask if there exists a viable proof technique for the @xmath3 conjecture that is better than the trivial brute - force technique as per some measure of complexity other than the obvious ones  space and time .",
    "but since we can not think of any such nonobvious complexity measures which are also natural in the context of the @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 problem , we shall confine ourselves to only @xmath0-verifiable proof techniques in what follows .    by hypothesis  [ hphflipformalnew ] ( a ) , which is supported by the results that we described in this article ,",

    "this is easy to see when the base field @xmath397 is finite .",
    "then the length of any obstruction in the trivial brute - force technique mentioned in the beginning of this section is exponential .",

    "for a given @xmath22 , the set of functions over @xmath2 computable by circuits of size at most @xmath624 , height at most @xmath625 and degree at most @xmath626 is an algebraically _ constructible _ @xcite subset @xmath627 of the space @xmath40 of all forms in @xmath8 variables of degree @xmath590 .",

    "this means computation of the grbner basis of @xmath628 can take space that is exponential in the dimension of the ambient space @xmath40 , which in turn is exponential in @xmath8 .",
    "in other words , space that is double exponential in @xmath8 , and hence , time that is triple exponential in @xmath8 . given that the @xmath627 in our problem is really bad , this is the best that we can expect from any general purpose technique for verifying an obstruction that reasons about @xmath627 directly in this fashion .    for the technique to be @xmath0-verifiable , the huge gap between this triple exponential bound for a general purpose direct technique and the polynomial bound in definition  [ dpveri1 ] has to be bridged .",

    "the @xmath0-barrier  is exactly the same that we encountered in section  [ seasybarrier ] .    the triple exponential size of this gap when @xmath587 as against the exponential size over @xmath617 does not mean that the @xmath3 conjecture is easier when @xmath617 . in fact",
    ", it is the other way around .",
    "since the ( nonuniform ) @xmath3 conjecture in characteristic zero ( over @xmath149 ) is a weaker implication of the conjecture over finite field ( the usual case ) @xcite .",

    "it is a nice algebraic variety that contains @xmath627 , or rather its projectivization .",
    "so instead of trying to show that a given @xmath418 is not in @xmath627 , one strives to show that it is not in @xmath15 .",
    "since the algebraic geometry of @xmath15 is exceptional , this problem becomes easier  especially when @xmath418 is also exceptional , like @xmath20 .",
    "the quantum - group and algebro - geometric machinery is needed in gct just to cross the @xmath0-barrier for verification ( over @xmath2 ) .",
    "this suggests that mathematics required for any @xmath0-verifiable approach towards the @xmath3 conjecture may not be substantially simpler , or easier .",

    "thus a major part of the effort in the @xmath0-verifiable proofs above indeed seems to go towards developing a polynomial time or a better polynomial time algorithm for constructing a proof - certificate , as per the @xmath0-hypothesis ( c ) , though this goal may not be stated explicitly in the proofs . in the flip ,",
    "@xmath0-constructivity as a goal is explicitly spelled out right in the beginning , given the complexity - theoretic significance of the @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 problem .",
    "but just as in the examples above , it may not be necessary to prove phflip ( hypothesis  [ hphflipformalnew ] ) fully to prove @xmath3 over @xmath2 .",
    "that is , it may suffice to develop only a part of all ingradients needed to put the required problems in @xmath0 , and the remaining part can be left to posterity . in this context , the basic minimum that seems to be needed is ph1 ( more or less ) .      we will now try to formalize the intuition behind the @xmath0-hypothesis ( d ) . towards that end",
    "we wish to associate a measure of _ proof - complexity _ with a @xmath0-verifiable proof technique .",
    "this is quite different , for example , from kolmogrov proof - complexity .",
    "[ dexpcomplexity1 ] explicit construction complexity of a @xmath0-constructive technique is the computational complexity of the algorithm underlying that technique for explicit construction of a proof - certificate .    by computational complexity , we mean the usual measures such as depth and size of the corresponding computational circuit .",
    "if a @xmath0-verifiable technique is not explicitly @xmath0-constructive but naturally leads to an algorithm for construction of obstructions , with additional effort , we agree to take the computational complexity of this algorithm to be explicit construction complexity of the technique , albeit only a posteriori .",
    "\\(b ) explicit construction ( complexity ) class of a @xmath0-verifiable proof technique is the computational complexity class of the problem of explicit construction of a proof - certificate as per that technique .",
    "a computational complexity class here means an abstract computation complexity class such as @xmath0 , @xmath304 , @xmath652 , @xmath653 , @xmath654 etc .",
    "the verification and explicit construction classes of a @xmath0-verifiable technique are well defined regardless of whether the technique shows how to construct a proof - certificate explicitly or not .",
    "but what these classes are may become clear only a posteriori , possibly after extending the proof technique to a get an efficient algorithm for construction of a proof certificate therein .",
    "the complexity measures and classes above are meaningful only for @xmath0-verifiable proof techniques .",
    "they would not make any sense for nonconstructive or estimate - based techniques in analysis , number theory and so forth , unless it is possible to define a specification complexity @xmath638 and a proof - certificate that is polynomial time verifiable with this definition of @xmath638 naturally .      explicit construction complexity ( class ) of a @xmath0-verifiable theorem is the minimum explicit construction complexity ( class ) over all @xmath0-verifiable proofs of the theorem .",
    "verification complexity ( class ) is defined similarly .",
    "verification class here is @xmath653 ( constant depth circuits ) , since a perfect matching can be verified in constant depth . a perfect matching in a bipartite graph",
    "can be computed , if one exists , in @xmath655 time .",
    "this problem also belongs to @xmath656 @xcite .",
    "hence , the sequential explicit construction class of hall s theorem is @xmath657 .",
    "the parallel explicit construction class is @xmath656 ; possibly even @xmath304 .",
    "verification class here is @xmath653 .",
    "explicit construction complexity of the proof in @xcite is @xmath658 , whereas that of the proof in @xcite is @xmath659 @xcite .",
    "thus a proof technique with lower explicit construction complexity has indeed lower proof - complexity .",
    "the sequential explicit construction class of the four colour theorem is thus @xmath660 , or lower .",
    "the parallel explicit construction class is possibly @xmath304 , in view of the parallel algorithms for four colouring in special cases @xcite .",
    "verification class is ac .",
    "explicit construction complexity of the proof in @xcite is @xmath661 , where @xmath115 is an explicit function of the genus @xmath115 .",
    "the sequential explicit construction class of the forbidden minor theorem is thus @xmath662 ; it may be @xmath663 .",
    "the parallel explicit construction class may be @xmath304 , since planarity testing is in @xmath304 @xcite .",
    "verification class of the poincare conjecture is @xmath0 @xcite , assuming that the proof technique in @xcite is @xmath0-verifiable .",
    "it may be smaller .",
    ". explicit construction class may be @xmath0 , plausibly smaller .",
    "@xmath304 ?",
    "we now give a trivial example to illustrate why @xmath0-verifiability is essential for the complexity measures here to make sense .",
    "take a trivial mathematical theorem : that an integer @xmath22 has at most @xmath664 factors .",
    "an obvious proof - certificate , for a given @xmath22 , is the number of its factors , which shows that it is less than @xmath664 .",
    "but verification of this proof requires factoring and hence is hard .",
    "thus if @xmath22 is specified in binary , this theorem should not be @xmath0-verifiable .",
    "that is why explicit construction complexity of this proof - certificate says nothing of the actual ( trivial ) proof - complexity of the theorem .",
    "similarly , explicit construction complexity is not meaningful for estimate - centred proof techniques in mathematics .",
    "the article @xcite roughly says that such techniques are not expected to work in the context of the @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 problem since they tend to be applicable to a large fraction of functions .",
    "[ dexpcomplexity2 ] explicit construction complexity of a @xmath0-constructive technique for the @xmath3 conjecture is the computational complexity of the algorithm underlying that technique for explicit construction of a proof - certificate ( as per that technique ) .",
    "\\(a ) verification complexity class of a @xmath0-verifiable proof technique for the @xmath3 conjecture is the computational complexity class of the problem of verifying an obstruction as per that technique .",
    "again these classes are well - defined regardless of whether the technique shows how to construct an obstruction explicitly or not , once the notion of an obstruction in the proof technique is well - defined",
    ".    one may also define _ existential complexity class _ of a @xmath0-verifiable proof technique ( for the @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 problem ) : this is the computational complexity class of the problem of deciding if there exists an obstruction for a given @xmath22 and circuit size @xmath8 .",
    "the existence - vs - construction principle @xcite says that computational complexity of a construction problem is comparable to that of the associated existence problem under natural conditions .",
    "this means , under natural conditions , existential and explicit - construction complexity classes should coincide .",
    "hence , we shall not worry about existential complexity anymore .    it is illuminating to compare the verification complexity of the @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 problem with the other problems we considered . the verification complexity class of halls theorem , four colour theorem , or forbidden minor theorem is ac . for poincare s conjecture ,",
    "@xmath0-verifiability is quite nontrivial @xcite .",
    "but fortunately the proof is not very complex .",
    "now we ask if there is a @xmath0-verifiable proof technique towards the @xmath3 conjecture that is substantially `` easier '' than gct . by easier we mean , with lower verification and explicit construction complexity ( classes ) . since gct is @xmath0-verifiable and also @xmath0-constructive over @xmath2 as per hypothesis  [ hphflipformalnew ] , @xmath3 conjecture is conjecturally @xmath0-verifiable and also @xmath0-constructive over @xmath99 .",
    "the same can be conjectured over @xmath589 or @xmath595 as well @xcite . assuming this , it is meaningful to talk of its verification and explicit construction classes .",
    "so we can ask :      the best and the most natural answer that one can expect here is @xmath0",
    ". it would really be unsettling if the answer were , say , @xmath304 .",
    "specifically , the problems of verification and explicit construction of obstructions in any @xmath0-verifiable approach to the @xmath3 conjecture should be at least as hard as @xmath0-complete problems .",
