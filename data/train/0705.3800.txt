    "ngc6052 ( also known as mrk297 , arp209 , vv86 ) is an interacting system located at a distance of 70.4mpc and having an l@xmath3l@xmath4 @xcite , which puts it into the class of luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) .",
    "the peculiar morphology of the system has made it the subject of several multi - wavelength observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there is a general consensus that ngc6052 is a merger of two galaxies @xcite , although the exact morphological type of the galaxies involved is still unclear .",
    "h-@xmath5 imaging revealed a number of star formation regions throughout the system @xcite .",
    "@xcite identified the locations of forty - three different optical knots in ngc6052 , distributed along the central bar - like structure of the galaxy and on the spiral - arm / tidal feature which extends along the north - south direction .",
    "an extensive study of the infrared properties of the system was performed with the infrared space observatory ( iso ) involving both mir imaging with isocam and spectroscopy with phot - s and lws @xcite .",
    "seven mir knots were visible in the 14.3images of the system .",
    "the most luminous of these sources , identified as `` region-1 '' by @xcite , is approximately 8  to the north of the main bulge of the galaxy .",
    "this source contributes @xmath022% of the 15  flux of ngc6052 , yet the iso data indicated that it was faint optically .",
    "this suggested that it may be a more extreme example of the infrared - bright , optically - obscured `` overlap region '' region found between the two galactic nuclei of the antennae galaxies @xcite .",
    "the mir luminosity of the ngc6052 source is a factor of @xmath014 higher than that of the antennae source .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the source is an obscured active galactic nucleus , like ic694 @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis was tested by @xcite using infrared diagnostics , who concluded that an agn in the ngc6052 source would be deeply embedded and needed to be confirmed with hard x - ray observations .    in this paper , we present photometry and spectroscopy of the three brightest mir regions in ngc6052 and photometry of a fourth region , using the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) on board the spitzer space telescope .",
    "we present the observations and data reduction in  2 , the analysis in  3 , and discuss the implications of our observations in  4 .",
    "ngc6052 was observed in mapping mode with the spitzer / irs @xcite in both the short - low ( sl , 5.2 - 14.5 ) and long - low ( ll , 14.0 - 38.0 ) modules . the sl data were obtained on 15 july 2004 and the ll data on 4 march and 17 july 2004 , resulting in a map of the central area of the system over the whole 5.337  range .",
    "the total exposure time per irs slit was 44  sec for sl , and 20  sec for ll .",
    "target acquisition was performed using the irs blue ( 16 ) peak - up camera . as a result of the irs peak - up procedure ,",
    "a 16  image with a total exposure time of 201  sec centered on the brightest position of our target was obtained .",
    "the field of view of the image is 60@xmath672  and its scale is 1.8pixel@xmath7 .",
    "all the observations were processed by the _ spitzer _",
    "science center pipeline version 13.2 .",
    "the stability of spitzer s pointing enables the registration of the image on a world coordinate system ( wcs ) grid with an accuracy which is better than the pixel size of the peak - up array .",
    "the 16  contours along with 2mass contours are overlaid on the hst image in figure [ puimage ] .",
    "two different spectral extractions were performed .",
    "first , an integrated spectrum of ngc6052 was extracted using the spectral modeling , analysis , and reduction tool ( smart ver .",
    "5.5.1 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for all the sl and ll pointings of the spectral map .",
    "the 2d images were coadded together and a standard full slit extraction was performed on each coadded low resolution aperture .",
    "the resulting spectrum is shown in figure [ intspec ] .",
    "second , we extracted individual sources ( labeled a , b , and c in figure [ puimage ] ) in the sl module . sources",
    "a and c were located within the same slit , requiring the development of custom software to perform a gaussian model fit to the spatial profile of multiple sources within a slit .",
    "each source in the slit was traced using information about the location of each wavelength element on the array @xcite .",
    "we estimate the cross - contamination between sources a and c to be @xmath8% .",
    "the full - width at half - maximum of each curve fit was assumed to be the same as that of a stellar point - source , and therefore was allowed to vary with wavelength .",
    "source b was extracted in a likewise fashion , for one source within a slit .",
    "the spectral map does not cover source d.    we flux calibrated the data using observations of @xmath5 lac that were extracted in exactly the same manner as the object spectra .",
    "the extracted spectrum from the star was used in conjunction with a template to produce a relative spectral response function ( rsrf ) @xcite .",
    "the rsrf was applied to each extracted spectrum of ngc6052 .",
    "the spectra of sources a , b and c are shown in figure  [ multispec ] .",
    "we estimate our spectrophotometry to be better than 10% .",
    "the flux from the various polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) features was calculated using the fitted drude profiles from the spectral decompositions described in  [ sec : spectraldecomposition ] . the [ ne  ii]12.81  line flux",
    "was also measured using this fitting method since it is blended with the 12.7  pah feature in the sl module .",
    "all other atomic lines have a well defined continuum , so we calculated their total fluxes by simply summing the pixel values following a local continuum subtraction .",
    "our pah feature and line measurements are presented in table  [ tabflux ] .",
    "near - ir j , h , and k aperture photometry was performed on the 2mass images @xcite at the positions of sources a , b , c , and d. these measurements are included with the spectra in figure  [ multispec ] , as they are important to the spectral decompositions ( discussed in  [ sec : spectraldecomposition ] ) . to compare the overall optical morphology of the system to the thermal dust emission we use a v - band ( f555w ) hubble space telescope ( hst ) image of the galaxy from the hst archive ( figure  [ puimage ] ) .",
    "we also use archival broadband mir images of ngc6052 obtained with the infrared array camera ( irac ) instrument on spitzer @xcite .",
    "the images were obtained on march 27 , 2005 with the 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0  broadband filters and they were processed with the spitzer science center pipeline version 14.0 .",
    "the fwhm of the point spread function of the images varies between 1.6 and 2.0 for the different filters .",
    "the images have a pixel size of 1.2  @xmath61.2  and a field of view 5.2  @xmath6 5.2 .",
    "the total integration time per filter was 150s .",
    "the distribution of dust and star emission from ngc6052 is displayed in figure  [ puimage ] , where we overlay contours of the 16 blue peak - up ( bpu ) and 2mass k - band images onto the optical hst image .",
    "the regions marked a , b , c , and d align with optically visible hii regions , but none are associated with the two brightest optical regions , which are labeled by @xcite as the compact regions of the merged galaxies forming ngc6052 .",
    "see table  [ srcid ] for a comparison of our source identification to the mir regions from @xcite and the b - r color knots from @xcite .",
    "source alignment was based on the reconstructed pointing of spitzer and the astrometry of the 2mass image . with the better registration of spitzer and 2mass",
    ", we find that source a is shifted 4  north relative to the optical , compared to the iso data presented in @xcite , and is not as optically - obscured as was previously thought based on isocam data .",
    "the pointing accuracy of spitzer is a factor of two smaller than the 1.8  pixel size of the 16  image .",
    "we confirmed our astrometry using 2mass j , irac 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0 , and irs 16.0  images , as shown in the figure  [ astrometry ] mosaic .",
    "this mosaic best illustrates the centroid shifts of the sources .",
    "the location of the near - ir bulge of the galaxy is indicated by a white cross and we observe an obvious shift in the emission as wavelebgth changes from predominantly main sequence star light in the 2mass image , to pah and hot dust in the irac bands , to just dust at 16.0 .",
    "it is clear that the concentration of warm dust and pah emission as traced by the irac 5.8 and 8  bands lies to the north and east of the nir bulge , in regions a , b and c , and more faintly along the eastern tidal arm , where source d lies . at 16 , where more embedded star forming regions may be probed ,",
    "the spatial resolution is lower , but most of the emission originates from regions a and b.    the total mir flux of the galaxy at 16  is measured as 260 mjy @xmath9 @xmath0 12% ( see table  [ srcid ] for a complete list of flux densities ) .",
    "@xcite found a 15  flux density of 289 mjy @xmath9 @xmath0 15% .",
    "this flux density , as well as our 16  image , globally match the mir morphology presented by @xcite using isocam .",
    "@xcite showed that region a in ngc6052 contributes 22% of the total emission at 15 .",
    "in contrast , see table  [ srcid ] , we find that region a contributes only 18.5% of the total emission at 16 .",
    "this difference in flux density between the isocam measurements and the spitzer irs bpu measurements is equal to 18.5 mjy . a similar difference of 67 mjy between the isocam 7.7  and the irac 8  fluxes , where the isocam measurement is again higher than what we measure , is also noted .",
    "the reason for these differences is unclear .",
    "all of our flux measurements appear to be systematically lower than those given by @xcite .",
    "since radio emission is also an extinction - free tracer of star forming regions , we use the high resolution radio continuum map of @xcite to compare the radio morphology of the galaxy to our 16  image .",
    "the radio map gives evidence for a bright radio supernova located at the position of knot 14 in @xcite @xcite .",
    "knot 14 , which is unresolved in the mir , does not coincide with either regions a or c ( see figure  [ puimage ] ) , but it does fall within the sl slit . as a result it is possible that some of the emission from the source surrounding the radio supernova may contribute to the extracted irs spectra of sources a and c. @xcite notes that the flux from hecquet s knot 14 is either from sn 1982aa ( five years after the explosion ) or from an hii region . as is discussed by @xcite",
    "the most likely type for sn 1982aa is ib / c .",
    "the hst image of figure  [ puimage ] indicates that the position attributed to knot 14 of @xcite is a diffuse hii region .",
    "however , the supernova presumed to be associated with knot 14 is not visible in recent optical and near - ir images and the spectra of regions a and c do not greatly differ in spectral continuum slope or feature strength from that of region b ( see  [ sec : spitzerspectroscopy ] below ) . in other words ,",
    "we see no mir features associated with the supernova , and its hii region is unresolved .",
    "there is a region to the northeast of sn 1982aa in yin s radio continuum map which is associated with our region a. there is also diffuse radio emission associated with regions b and c. region d is not resolved in the radio continuum map .",
    "our spectrum , displayed in figure  [ intspec ] , is in overall agreement with the 611  spectrum obtained by iso / phot - s in @xcite .",
    "our spectrum displays strong emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.25 12.7 and 17.1 .",
    "several fine structure lines , including [ ne   ii ] , [ ar  iii ] , [ s  iv ] , and [ ne  iii ] , are also clearly visible in the spectrum , as well as the molecular hydrogen lines : s(3)@xmath109.66 ; and s(2)@xmath1012.27 .",
    "the ratio [ ne  iii]/[ne  ii]=0.84 @xmath90.16 while the [ s   iv]/[s  iii]=0.52 @xmath90.18 .",
    "this is similar to typical values ( @xmath01 and @xmath00.5 respectively ) found in other starburst galaxies @xcite and lower than those seen in blue compact dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "in addition , the narrow width of the irs sl slits ( 3.6 ) enable us to obtain 5.315  spectra for the three brightest mir regions in the galaxy .",
    "extending the spectrum of those regions to longer wavelengths was not possible since the individual regions are unresolved within the 9.7@xmath11 width of the irs 1537  ll slit .",
    "inspection of our irs spectra , displayed in figure  [ multispec ] , reveals that the mir spectra for all three regions are surprisingly similar .",
    "for instance , even though region a is brighter than regions b or c at 16 , lending to a marginally steeper mir slope , the pah spectrum shows few noticeable differences .",
    "of special note is the shallow 9.6  silicate absorption feature",
    ". we will elaborate on a possible physical explanation of these features in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .    table  [ tabflux ] lists the integrated line fluxes and major pah features for the whole system , as well as in the individual regions a , b , and c.      in order to characterize the properties of the emitting and obscuring dust ( including dust temperatures , optical depths , and pah feature strengths ) , we decompose the infrared spectral energy distribution of each spectrum into emission from : ( 1 ) multiple dust components at different characteristic temperatures ; ( 2 ) stellar photospheres ; ( 3 ) pahs ; and ( 4 ) atomic and molecular lines .",
    "the contribution from each dust component is calculated using a realistic dust model consisting of a distribution of thermally emitting carbonaceous and silicate grains .",
    "the model accounts for stochastic emission from pahs by fitting observationally derived pah templates to the spectra .",
    "details of the method are described in @xcite ( and see @xcite for additional applications ) .",
    "for the integrated spectrum of the galaxy we find that three dust components fit the data well , at temperatures of 25 , 57 , and 203 @xmath95 k. the @xmath12@xmath13 for the global spectrum was found to be 0.9 @xmath9 0.5 , where the uncertainty is due to statistics , as well as the dependence on model choice for the pah template and dust geometry .",
    "this number is far more than the optical depth computed by @xcite of @xmath12@xmath14 @xmath15 0.9 which corresponds to @xmath12@xmath13 @xmath00.1 using a standard extinction curve .",
    "@xcite derive their @xmath12@xmath14 from the modeled mass fraction of hydrogen and the mass fraction of stars .",
    "in contrast , our optical depth estimate is derived from the mir spectrum .",
    "the integrated pah luminosity of the system is @xmath06.5% @xmath9 0.5% of the total l@xmath16 , nearly 50% higher than the value found for the prototypical starburst galaxy ngc7714 @xcite .",
    "the sum of the 6.2  pah feature strengths from regions a , b , and c is @xmath019% of the total 6.2  pah feature strength from the integrated spectrum . in comparison ,",
    "the 14flux from regions a , b , and c totals to @xmath040% of the 14flux from the integrated spectrum .",
    "the pah emission in the galaxy is therefore dominated by the diffuse regions , not associated with the brightest mir sources .",
    "regions a , b , and c have derived warm dust temperatures of 187  k ( source a ) ; 179  k ( source b ) ; and 201  k ( source c ) , with statistical uncertainties from the fits of a few k. the lack of higher spatial resolution photometry beyond 15  for this system clearly limits our ability to trace the behavior of colder dust components for individual regions .",
    "the optical depths at 9.7  of the warm dust components are 0.76 , 0.58 , and 0.75 @xmath9 0.2 for regions a , b , and c , respectively .",
    "in addition , optical depths from the interstellar radiation field ( isrf , @xcite ) are 0.31 , 0.47 , and 0.24 @xmath9 0.2 for sources a , b , and c , respectively . generally speaking",
    ", each region has a similar optical depth at 9.7 , @xmath00.6 - 0.8 , and the isrf optical depth is about uniform for each region , @xmath00.3 - 0.4 .    to confirm our estimates for source extinction and age based on mir data , an independent assessment using broadband photometry from @xcite and a standard extinction curve @xcite was established . using the b - r colors published by @xcite and the ages derived in our starburst models ( see  [ sec : starburstmodeling ] ) we derived e(b - r ) for regions a , b , and c , and compared these values to the standard extinction curve .",
    "the @xmath12@xmath13 values for our three sources are 0.27 , 0.17 , and 0.16 , respectively .",
    "these values are a factor of two or three less than those derived from the mir spectra . the mir probes more deeply into dust - enshrouded regions than optical light , which tends to be dominated by emission from less - obscured stars",
    ". thus mir indicators of extinction tend to give higher values than optical .",
    "the atomic lines present in the single source spectra ( figure  [ multispec ] ) enable us to investigate the nature of the sources powering the mir in ngc6052 .",
    "[ ar  iii ] , [ ne  ii ] , and [ s  iv ] lines are detected in all three regions . by applying the measurements of these atomic lines to young stellar population models",
    ", we have estimated relative ages for the young stellar populations of sources a and c , and have established an upper limit for source b. we used starburst99 @xcite to model the radiation from the underlying stellar population , and mappings iii @xcite to estimate the flux from the photoionized regions .",
    "the stellar population models were used as input to the photoionization code .",
    "the age of the stellar population was allowed to vary and the models were run for several metallicities between z@xmath4/20 and 2z@xmath4 .",
    "the reason we varied the metallicity was also motivated by the fact that there is a scatter in the published values of the metallicity of mrk 297 .",
    "@xcite estimates [ o / h ] to be 8.34 . assuming solar abundance of 8.83 @xcite , this scales to @xmath0 @xmath17 .",
    "likewise , @xcite and @xcite found [ o / h ] = 8.61 and 8.65 respectively ( z @xmath18 @xmath19 ) .",
    "our best fit models are for solar metallicity .",
    "the imf is fixed at the standard salpeter values of @xmath20 2.35 , m@xmath21 1.0 m@xmath4 and m@xmath22 100 m@xmath4 , and the star formation mode was instantaneous . as such",
    ", the variation of the ionization parameter is only linked to the variation in age and metallicity of the stellar population .",
    "we find that the young stellar populations in source a is @xmath03 myr @xmath9 0.5 myr , while for source c it is @xmath05.5 @xmath9 0.5 myr . for source b though we can only place an upper limit of @xmath2 5 myr due to the fact that the models were degenerate for region b s atomic line ratios , which are consistent with ages of both @xmath01.5 and @xmath04 myr .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section and presented in figure [ multispec ] , there is a strong similarity in all three mir - bright region spectra in ngc6052 .",
    "starburst models have shown regions a , b , and c are nearly coeval , which suggests that some mechanism induced star formation across the galaxy simultaneously .",
    "this mechanism is most probably the collision of two galaxies as discussed in @xcite , though why the burst of star formation should come 150 myr after the two galaxies closest approach is unclear .",
    "the shallow 9.6  silicate absorption feature observed in all of our spectra ( indicative of low optical depths ) , in conjunction with the morphological properties discussed in  [ sec : globalmorphology ] lead us to believe ngc6052 has a nonuniform obscuring dust screen associated with it .",
    "the shallow 9.6  feature implies that the dominant sources of mir emission are not embedded dusty star forming regions but rather exposed in a manner where we can readily sample the mir contribution from the photodissociation regions .",
    "an embedded geometry would be proposed if the silicate feature were much deeper , as is seen in ulirgs @xcite , where hot dust temperatures suggest that the dust is very close to the hot , young stars heating it .",
    "this is clearly not the case in ngc6052 .",
    "dust temperatures in ngc6052 of around 200 k ( as opposed to the @xmath0700 k found in by @xcite or even the @xmath1 300 k dust temperatures implied in the overlap region of the antennae described by @xcite ) mean the dust is relatively far away from the heating source , likely in the form of a dust screen in front of the exciting sources .",
    "a non - embedded geometry would also explain why the continuum is not as steep as other embedded systems .",
    "however , we believe this screen to be nonuniform because the system is still in an early stage of interaction and has not reached the merger phase",
    ". there are no apparent symmetries visible in the mir morphology of the system ; the coincidence of concentrated mir flux with a select few hii regions appears arbitrary .    that ngc6052 is enshrouded nonuniformly by dust is in general agreement with other published indications of nonuniformity .",
    "@xcite found `` large residuals '' in their k - band model - subtracted image of the galaxy and concluded that ngc6052 has a `` thin diffuse patchy structure '' .",
    "the predicted morphology of the system based on dynamical modeling of the stellar component by @xcite demonstrated that when they can reproduce the overall morphology of the system ( see their figures 2 and 4 ) , one of the tidal tails extends to the north of the central bulge of the galaxy , across the location of regions a and c , while the other tidal tail extends eastward , across region b and including region d. based on this scenario it is thus conceivable that clumpy gas and dust associated with these tails are associated with the four distinct regions we see in the infrared .",
    "in  [ sec : globalmorphology ] we noted that region a , which emits most at 16 , contributes 18.5 % of the total flux .",
    "this fact begs comparison to the fluxes of the obscured regions of the antennae galaxies and ic694 , since both of these systems have off - nuclear sources which contribute largely to the mir emission .",
    "the hidden source in the antennae galaxy contributes 15 % of the total luminosity between 12.5  and 18  @xcite , and ic694 contributes @xmath0 26 % of the total flux between 12and 18 .",
    "however , neither of the hidden sources present such spectral similarities with other regions of their host galaxy as region a does to the other regions of ngc6052 ( cf .",
    "the spectra presented in @xcite ) . also , we now know that all of the mir - bright regions in ngc6052 are optically visible ( see table  [ srcid ] ) . for this reason , and because there is currently no evidence which allows region a to be considered an agn ( as is the case with the obscured source in ic694 ) , a comparison between ngc6052 and these two objects yields very little information about the physical properties of the mir - bright regions .    because all of the mir bright regions in ngc6052 lie within the dust trail or in one of the two tidal tails , we compare ngc6052 to other galaxies with bright sources existing in the tidal tails",
    ". one obvious comparison can be drawn with the mir - bright region in ngc2207 / ic2163 .",
    "this region ( called `` feature i '' ) contributes 12% of the total 24flux , and also dominates the h-@xmath5 and radio continuum emission @xcite .",
    "the implication of this finding is that `` feature i '' is a compact region of star formation .",
    "our region a also exhibits bright mir flux and corresponding radio emission ( see  [ sec : radiocontinuumemission ] and @xcite ) .",
    "tidal tail - induced star formation is also present in the arp82 system , where the brightest off - nuclear clump contributes @xmath0 7% of the total 24  flux @xcite .",
    "region d likewise contributes @xmath0 5% of the total 16  flux .",
    "we can also calculate the mir luminosities of the regions in ngc6052 and compare them with studies which include other interacting galaxy samples ( i.e. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for regions",
    "a , b and c we find that the 3.6  luminosities , which we treat as a proxy of the stellar mass content , are 1.34 , 1.38 and 1.77@xmath610@xmath23 ergs s@xmath7 respectively .",
    "the 8.0  luminosities , which probe the emission from pah molecules and thus are tracers of the star formation activity , are 7.46 , 7.13 and 8.30@xmath610@xmath23 ergs s@xmath7 for the same three regions .",
    "these values are very similar to values found in the spiral galaxy and the tidal feature samples of @xcite ( see their figs . 12 and 13 ) if one takes into account that there is an rms of @xmath00.5 in dex in the values of the smith et al . sample .",
    "when we examine region d in the tidal tail of ngc6052 we find that its 3.6 and 8.0  luminosities are 7.05@xmath610@xmath24 ergs s@xmath7 and 2.50@xmath610@xmath23 ergs s@xmath7 respectively .",
    "these luminosities are slightly higher than the mean value of the tidal features in the smith et al . sample . however , ngc6052 is also nearly 3 times more distant than the furthest source in the smith et al .",
    "survey , so in our photometry for all four regions of our galaxy we may be including other parts of the galaxy which would have likely been excluded by @xcite .",
    "this inherent error is likely biasing our luminosity measurements towards measurements made of entire galaxies , and away from small - scale tidal features .",
    "we have presented photometric and spectroscopic results of the ngc6052 system .",
    "the main conclusions of our analysis are as follow : ( 1 ) the brighteset mir region , labeled a , contributes @xmath0 18.5% of the total 16  flux , and resembles the brightest 24 source from ngc2207 / ic2163 photometrically , but is dissimilar spectroscopically from the hidden sources in the antennae galaxies and arp299 ; ( 2 ) the spectra of regions a , b , and c are all surprisingly similar , and are consistent with dust emission from nearly coeval young stellar populations ; ( 3 ) the geometry of this system includes a patchy dust screen of colder material in front of the young stellar clusters , and these clusters are not deeply embedded in dusty material ; and ( 4 ) region d has mir properties which are typical of those found in tidal tails .",
