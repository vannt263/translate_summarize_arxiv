    "the concept of odd - frequency pairing offers interesting symmetry aspects of nonuniform superconductivity and superfluidity.@xcite although the odd - frequency pairing state was originally proposed as a uniform superfluid state in bulk,@xcite it may also emerge in , e.g. , superconducting proximity structures .",
    "bergeret , volkov , and efetov pointed out , in their theoretical work on a ferromagnet - superconductor proximity structure , that triplet @xmath0-wave pairs are created in a ferromagnet attached to a conventional singlet @xmath0-wave superconductor.@xcite in the ferromagnet , spin - rotation symmetry is broken and the resulting singlet - triplet spin mixing generates the triplet pairs from the singlet pairs penetrating from the superconductor .",
    "the pauli principle requires that the triplet @xmath0-wave pair amplitude be an odd function of the matsubara frequency , and thus this pairing state belongs to the odd - frequency symmetry class .",
    "similar odd - frequency pairing takes place even in a normal metal when a superconductor is in contact with it through a spin - active interface.@xcite in proximity structures , broken translation symmetry resulting from the presence of the interface / surface provides another mechanism responsible for the emergence of odd - frequency states .",
    "the symmetry breaking in real space causes mixing of different orbital - parity states , so that admixtures of even- and odd - frequency states arise around the interface / surface .",
    "@xcite this creation mechanism works without any magnetism and suggests a ubiquitous existence of odd - frequency pairing states in nonuniform systems .",
    "recently , yokoyama , tanaka , and nagaosa examined the effect of odd - frequency pairing on the magnetic response of a normal metal  superconductor junction with a spin - active interface.@xcite on the basis of usadel s dirty - limit theory,@xcite it was shown that the proximity - induced odd - frequency pairing state exhibits _ paramagnetic _",
    "meissner response and gives rise to oscillation of the penetrating magnetic field .",
    "the origin of this anomalous phenomenon can be found in the dirty - limit formula for the superfluid fraction ( the ratio of the superfluid density @xmath1 to the total number density @xmath2),@xcite @xmath3   \\right ) ,   \\label{usadel - j - formula}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the transport mean free time , @xmath5 is the inverse temperature , @xmath6 is the matsubara frequency , and @xmath7 is an @xmath0-wave pair amplitude defined as a spin - space matrix .",

    "in contrast , odd - frequency @xmath0-wave pairing is characterized by @xmath13 .",
    "we then obtain the _ negative _ pair density @xmath14 from the same expression as above .",
    "this means that the odd - frequency pairs carry paramagnetic meissner current .",
    "the negative pair density causes not only the paramagnetic meissner effect but also an unusual behavior of surface impedance.@xcite    an anomaly resulting from odd - frequency pairing also manifests itself in pauli spin susceptibility @xmath15.@xcite it was predicted that odd - frequency ( @xmath16@xmath17@xmath18)-triplet pairing in nonuniform superfluid @xmath19he _ increases _ the susceptibility @xmath15 , contrary to the conventional wisdom that antiparallel spin pairing reduces @xmath15 in superfluids and superconductors .",
