    "in the standard @xmath0cdm cosmology with the hierarchical structure formation paradigm , dark matter halos not only play an important role in galaxy formation and evolution , but also compose large - scale structures in the universe .",
    "dark matter first collapses and forms a gravitationally bound system , then baryons fall into the pre - existing potential well of dark matter halo and form galaxies @xcite .",
    "small halos grow into larger systems with mergers or accretion , and thus galaxies residing in the halos naturally evolve with the halo growth . furthermore ,",
    "in the past decade , large galaxy survey projects such as the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; * ? ? ? * ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ? * ) and large volume simulations using supercomputers like the millennium simulation @xcite and the horizon runs @xcite have revealed the existence of large - scale structures .",
    "since @xcite and @xcite found that the cluster environment affects the galaxy color , there have been numerous studies verifying the relations between galaxy properties and their environments .",
    "however , most of them have investigated local environments , which can be classified into cluster , group , or field . while the local environments of galaxies are confined to the inner halo regions , large - scale structures , such as superclusters , filaments , and voids are super - halo scale environments .",
    "therefore , the large - scale environment should be distinguished from the local environments .",
    "@xcite predicted that massive halos are more likely to occupy denser regions in a large - scale distribution .",
    "moreover , @xcite depicted that the large - scale environmental dependence of the galaxy luminosity function can be explained by the mass dependence of the halo bias .",
    "galaxy properties mainly depend on the inner halo environment defined by halo mass , and the bias of halo mass in large - scale distribution can cause large - scale environmental dependence . however , using n - body simulations , @xcite showed that halos in denser regions form slightly earlier than those in less dense regions , when halo mass is fixed .",
    "in addition , many theoretical works have found that the formation time of small halos ( @xmath1 at @xmath2 ) depends on the large - scale environment , which is known as _ the assembly bias _ ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . in short , not only is the halo mass biased by the large - scale environment , but the assembly time of halos also depends on the large - scale environment .",
    "the large - scale environmental effects on galaxies have become an active research area with the advent of wide field surveys . @xcite and @xcite attempted to find a correlation between the large - scale environment and the central galaxy color in sdss galaxy groups ; however , they concluded that the large - scale environment does not have any considerable effects on the central galaxy color .",
    "meanwhile , @xcite found , from 2dfgrs data , that galaxy groups with passive central galaxies at a fixed halo mass are strongly clustered , and it was supported by @xcite using sdss galaxies .",
    "furthermore , @xcite studied the correlation between the halo assembly bias and galaxy clustering using a semi - analytic model @xcite and reached a conclusion similar to the observational study of @xcite .",
    "@xcite also pointed out that the star formation rate of compact group galaxies is mildly dependent on the large - scale environment , based on sdss data .",
    "currently , it seems that galaxy properties are correlated with the large - scale environment in addition to the mass of host halo . however , there is still no clear understanding of the physical origins of these large - scale environmental effects in the baryonic universe .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the effect of large - scale dependence of halo assembly time on the mass assembly of galaxies using a cosmological n - body simulation and a semi - analytic model .",
    "in addition to the previous study of @xcite , which investigates the effects of the halo assembly bias on galaxy clustering , we examine the effect of the halo assembly bias on the mass assembly of galaxies .",
    "we first measure the mass assembly of halos in different large - scale environments from halo merger trees , and trace the evolution of the central galaxies in those halos by using a semi - analytic model .",
    "this scheme allows us to study the direct connection between halos and their central galaxies according to the mass assembly history and to test the existence of any effects of the halo assembly bias on those galaxies .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe the details of our cosmological n - body simulation and the scheme by which we construct halo merger trees from n - body simulations . in section 3 , we explain the measurement of the large - scale environment of halos and the classification of our sample halos and galaxies .",
    "we study the mass assembly history of dark matter halos and their central galaxies in section 4 , and in the final section , we discuss and summarize our results .",
    "we performed a cosmological dark matter - only simulation using parameters of the standard concordance cold dark matter cosmology using a cosmological constant @xmath3 , a current matter density parameter @xmath4 , the normalization factor of the initial power spectrum @xmath5 , the spectral index @xmath6 , and the hubble constant @xmath7km@xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "these parameter values are based on the seven - year wlikinson microwave anisotropy probe observations ( wmap ; * ? ? ?",
    "the cosmological hydrodynamic code used in this work is gadget-2 @xcite . for the simulation ,",
    "a periodic box - size was chosen as @xmath10mpc with @xmath11 dark matter particles.the dark matter particle mass was @xmath12 , and the gravitational softening length was @xmath13kpc .",
    "the dark matter particle position and velocity information were stored for 117 time - steps between z=13 and z=0 .",
    "the initial condition of the simulation was produced using mpgrafics @xcite , which is a parallel version of grafic1 @xcite .      in order to trace the formation and the mass assembly history of halos",
    ", we built dark matter halo merger trees from an n - body simulation .",
    "our treebuilder , ysamtm , was implemented into the semi - analytic model ( ysam ; * ? ? ?",
    "the first step in building dark matter halo merger trees is structure detection .",
    "we used the structure finding code ahf @xcite in this work .",
    "we define the halo center as the position of the densest region in the halo , as the center of mass is not a proper position for halos undergoing mergers .",
    "the halos and subhalos in the simulation are supposed to have at least 20 particles .    from the results of structure detection , we constructed dark matter halo merger trees .",
    "figure [ fig : halo merger ] briefly describes the definition of dark matter halo mergers .",
    "we define the beginning of the halo mergers using the virial radius criterion . a detailed procedure for building halo merger trees",
    "can be explained as follows :    , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    1 .",
    "the shared mass between halos at two subsequent snapshots is calculated by tracing the particle transfer between those halos . at this step ,",
    "particle transfers between halos in two snapshots are tracked using particle indexes , and individual particles should be included in a single halo or subhalo ; particles in a subhalo are not listed in the main halo of the subhalo .",
    "+ in order to be applicable to semi - analytic models , we find the unique descendant halos of individual progenitor halos . for one progenitor halo ,",
    "the shared masses of its descendant halos are compared , and the descendant halo with the largest shared mass among those descendants is assigned as a unique descendant halo of the progenitor . however ,",
    "if another descendant halo receives the largest fraction of its mass from the same progenitor , we determine this descendant halo to be a unique descendant of the progenitor , even if the shared mass of the descendant is not the largest compared to the other descendants .",
    "this additional process is needed to avoid a situation in which the small descendant halo is considered to be otherwise newly born . thus far , one descendant halo can be connected to multiple progenitor halos , whereas a single progenitor must have a unique descendant .",
    "if one descendant halo has multiple progenitors , the main progenitor halo is determined by maximizing @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the shared mass between the descendant halo and the progenitor halo , and @xmath16 is the list index of the progenitor halo . in figure",
    "[ fig : halo merger ] , the black ( thin ) solid arrows indicate a unique descendant - progenitor relation .",
    "the end of the halo mergers is defined as the moment when two progenitor halos have an identical descendant halo at the next snapshot . in figure",
    "[ fig : halo merger ] , the main halo and its subhalo at z=0.02 have the same descendant halo at z=0 . in this case , we consider z=0 to be the epoch when a halo merger is complete .",
    "4 .   in order to do this ,",
    "the progenitors of both the primary main halo and its subhalo are tracked backward , starting from the end of merger . at every output ,",
    "the distance between the two progenitors is compared to the virial radius of the primary halo .",
    "the moment when the small halo crosses the virial radius of the main halo is considered to be the beginning of the halo merger .",
    "this is equivalent to the moment when the small halo merges with the larger halo and becomes its substructure .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : halo merger ] , the small halo becomes a subhalo between z=0.06 and z=0.04 , which defines the beginning of the halo merger .",
    "5 .   for each halo at z=0 ,",
    "the whole merger history is constructed by backwards tracking progenitor halos including all progenitors of the halos which have finally merged into the object halo .",
    "fly - by events between halos can significantly inflate the number of halo mergers by double counting @xcite . by considering only the subhalos that were supposed to be finally merged and by tracing backward",
    ", we avoided the overestimation of halo mergers caused by fly - bys .",
    "the goal of this study is to investigate the environmental effects in large scales ; therefore we need to define the large - scale environment of halos . in the literature , there are two ways to measure the large - scale environment .",
    "the first is to measure the local overdensity in a sphere of radius r centered at a halo ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the other is to measure the halo bias using the two - point correlation function ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although the two - point correlation function is widely used to study the relations between halo clustering and halo properties ( formation , merger , dynamical structure , etc . ) , the correlation function itself is only dependent on the number of halo pairs . on the other hand ,",
    "the local overdensity more directly reflects the matter distribution of both the internal and external regions of halos .",
    "therefore , we chose to use the former method .",
    "the definition of the local overdensity ( @xmath17 ) is the same as that in @xcite and can be calculated as follows : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the matter density in a sphere with radius @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the mean matter density in a simulation box .",
    "the contribution of the central halo mass is removed by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the mass of the central halo , and @xmath24 is the volume of the sphere .",
    "it is worth mentioning how we choose the sphere radius for measuring the local overdensity . in order to understand the impact of different sphere radii , we calculated the local overdensity with various values ( @xmath25mpc , @xmath26mpc , @xmath27mpc , and @xmath28mpc ) .",
    "the results did not differ significantly with different sphere radii , which is consistent with previous studies @xcite .",
    "however , similar to the results presented in @xcite , we also found that the centric distance of the farthest particle sometimes exceeded @xmath26mpc for massive halos .",
    "therefore , we used @xmath27mpc in this study .      in order to compare halos at a fixed mass in different large - scale environments",
    ", we classified the halos in the present universe into three mass bins : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "this range of halo mass roughly covers single galaxies to small clusters .",
    "we focused on halos with the mass range @xmath32 at @xmath2 because there were not enough massive halos ( @xmath33 ) to be statistically analyzed , and smaller halos ( @xmath34 ) were excluded due to the resolution limits of our simulation .",
    "the definitions of high density and low density in large - scale environments were selected to be the top @xmath35 and the bottom @xmath35 of the local overdensity distribution ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the spatial distribution of halos is only slightly dependent on halo mass ; the average mass of halos in high - density regions is slightly larger than that of the halos in low - density regions even at the same mass bin .",
    "for all identified halos with the mass range @xmath31 , the average mass of halos in denser regions ( the top 20% ) is @xmath37 , while that of halos in less dense regions ( the bottom 20% ) is @xmath38 . to minimize the effect of halo mass dependence , we selected the same number of halos for different density groups until the average masses of halos in those groups became virtually identical .",

    "the main purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of the halo assembly bias on real galaxies . for the purpose ,",
    "we used a semi - analytic model ( ysam ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the model ,",
    "the mass accretion and mergers of galaxies follow the evolution of each halo merger tree , and many processes of baryonic physics ( gas cooling , star formation , feedback processes , etc . )",
    "are calculated using simple prescriptions .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that their model is calibrated to reproduce recent empirical data , and @xcite showed that the merger history of galaxies predicted by the model is comparable to the observational results of the cluster galaxies in @xcite .",
    "to investigate the impact of various sam parameters on our results presented in the parer , we varied the efficiencies of agn and supernovae feedbacks , which are considered important mechanisms in galaxy growth , in a factor of two ranges : from half to twice of our fiducial values .",
    "these wide ranges of efficiencies made noticeable differences in the galaxy stellar mass function at z=0 .",
    "we confirmed , however , that our result is not sensitive at all to the variation of feedback efficiencies .",
    "we perform our test on _ central _ galaxies because our research focus is on the assembly bias of host halos reflecting the outer environments of those halos , and central galaxies directly follow the formation and the mass growth of their host halos .",
    "satellite galaxies , on the other hand , are more likely to be affected by their host halo environment .",
    "in the current galaxy formation theory , the gas accretion in galaxies is strongly affected by the assembly history of dark matter halos . in this section",

    "the dashed curve was calculated using halos in a high - density environment ( the top 20% ) , and the dotted curve was computed using those in a low - density environment ( the bottom 20% ) .",
    "the vertical arrows indicate the formation time of dark matter halos .    in the top row of figure",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , the average mass of the halos shows that halos form earlier in denser regions than in less dense regions , and the difference in the halo formation time is larger in lower - mass halos ( panel ( a ) ) .",
    "this is in agreements with the previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the case of gaseous components ,",
    "the growth trend of hot gas ( middle row ) is very similar to that of dark matter halos , and the cold gas component ( bottom row ) follows the trend of dark matter halos and hot gas . in the semi - analytic model ,",
    "the amount of hot gas accreted onto dark matter halos follows the global baryonic fraction , @xmath53 , and cold gas increases from the cooling of the hot gas component .",
    "thus , the mass growth of hot and cold gas is similar to that of dark matter halos .      .",

    "the x - axis indicates the cosmic expansion factor .",
    "[ fig : fig4],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    following the growth history of gaseous components , we investigate the star formation history and the mass growth of stellar mass in central galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig : fig4 ] shows the star formation rates ( sfrs ; upper row ) and the specific star formation rates ( ssfrs ; bottom ) in the same mass bins as in figure [ fig : fig3 ] .    in the top row ,",
    "the sfrs of central galaxies in smaller halos ( @xmath54 ) are slightly higher in denser regions than in less dense regions , although they are almost the same in the case of more massive halos .",
    "this is because the central galaxies in smaller halos have more cold gas in high - density regions than in low - density regions ( see panel ( g ) in figure [ fig : fig3 ] ) , and the sfr is strongly dependent on the amount of cold gas .    on the other hand , the ssfrs ,",
    "the normalized sfrs , shows the same feature in both high- and low - density environments in all of the mass bins ( the bottom panels in figure [ fig : fig4 ] ) , which indicates that the amount of the newly formed stars per unit stellar mass is almost the same .",
    "this is consistent with a previous observational study on the star formation history by @xcite who concluded that the ssfr minimally depends on environments larger than @xmath55mpc from a galaxy .",
    "this section describes the mass growth rates of both halos and their central galaxies in an attempt to more directly search for the evidence of the assembly bias in the baryonic universe . @xcite",
    "investigated halo mass growth using an n - body simulation and concluded that , at present , low - mass halos are more apt to accrete their mass in low - density regions than in high - density regions , because halos in high - density regions form earlier .",
    "this means that halos in denser regions ( e.g. , filaments ) grow faster than those in less dense region ( e.g. , voids ) when halos mass is fixed .",
    "as seen in the first row of figure [ fig : fig5 ] , we reconfirmed that smaller halos in high - density regions grow faster .",
    "however , based on the mass growth rates of central galaxies ( middle row ) , we can not find evidence of any considerable dependence on the large - scale environment in any mass bins .",
    "in particular , in low - mass halos where mass growth shows a stronger assembly bias , the difference between the mass growth rates becomes mostly diminished in galaxies ( panel ( d ) ) .    .",
    "the dashed curve was calculated using halos in a high - density environment ( the top 20% ) , and the dotted curve was computed using those in a low - density environment ( the bottom 20% ) .",
    "the vertical arrows indicate the time at which the stellar mass reaches half of the final stellar mass of central galaxies .",
    "the x - axis indicates the cosmic expansion factor .",
    "[ fig : fig5],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the panels in the bottom row show the stellar mass of central galaxies .",
    "the galaxy formation times ( vertical arrows ) are not sensitive to the large - scale environments , even in smaller halos , where halos show a relatively stronger bias for assembly time ( see panel ( a ) of figure [ fig : fig3 ] ) . however , as a consequence of the higher sfr in small halos , stellar mass is slightly larger in denser regions than in less dense regions ( panel ( g ) ) .",
    "this research attempted to address how the assembly bias by the outer environment of halos affects the mass assembly of their central galaxies .",
    "it seems that the assembly time of dark matter halos is affected by the surrounding large - scale environment in the case of small halos that mainly host isolated galaxies .",
    "since the galaxy properties are strongly governed by the mass assembly of halos , it is supposed that the assembly bias probably affects the galaxies in various ways .    in short ,",
    "we predict that the ssfr and the normalized growth rate of the stellar mass show no marked sign of the assembly bias for any mass range .",
    "meanwhile , the stellar masses of central galaxies in fixed mass halos are slightly affected by the assembly bias of the halos . however , this effect is perhaps too small to detect in real galaxies , in light of the fact that , in observational data , accurate measurement of the halo mass of galaxies is problematic @xcite .    in this paper , we investigated whether central galaxies show the bias of mass assembly due to large - scale environments when considering over the effect of halo mass using a cosmological simulation and a semi - analytic model .",
    "our study is based on a controlled sample of halos and galaxies , which minimizes the dependence of halo mass .",
    "the results can be summarized as follows :    1 .   using an n - body simulation , we found that the assembly time of smaller halos ( @xmath54 ) at a fixed mass depends on the large - scale environment .",
    "halos in denser regions tend to form slightly earlier than those in sparse regions , for a given halo mass .",
    "the ssfrs and the normalized growth rates of the stellar mass of central galaxies hardly depend on the large - scale environment for all mass bins . for example , according to our models , the average values of the stellar mass - weighted age of central galaxies in those small halos in high- and low - density regions are @xmath56gyr and @xmath57gyr , respectively .",
    "3 .   in the case of small halos ( @xmath58 )",
    ", the assembly bias of halos due to the large - scale environment mildly affects the sfrs and the stellar masses of central galaxies in those halos .",
    "the sfrs of central galaxies are slightly higher in denser regions than in less dense regions , and consequently , the stellar masses of central galaxies are larger in high - density regions .    even in the case of small halos ( @xmath29 ) , which show a relatively stronger assembly bias , we predict that the growth rate of the stellar mass will not easily show the assembly bias .",
    "this is comprehensible in the sense that , unlike the assembly history of halos , galaxies are affected by complex baryonic physics such as gas cooling , feedback processes , and cluster environmental effects .",
    "those baryonic physics operate differently in individual galaxies through cosmic time , which mostly erases the records of the differences in the halo formation time .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that the clustering of central galaxies depends on the ssfr by using two - point correlation function statistics ( see their figure 2 ) : low - ssfr galaxies being more strongly clustered . at first glance",
    ", it seemed to be in contradiction to our result , but in truth it is not .",
    "the discrepancy arises from the use of different approaches , and our result and theirs show the two sides of the same coin .",
    "@xcite picked high and low ssfr galaxies and compared their spatial correlations .",
    "it is generally believed that at a fixed stellar mass , lower ssfr galaxies at @xmath2 tend to have earlier formation times .",
    "thus , their ssfr - based classification is inherently based on _ galaxy assembly time_. we on the other hand classified galaxies by _ large - scale density environment_. in our approach , sample galaxies in the same density environment have a variety of star formation histories , and the galaxies showing a strong assembly bias account for a relatively small fraction . as a result of our approach ,",
    "the mean sfrs and final stellar masses of central galaxies in the different environments show up to a factor of two difference , which is clearly present but challengingly small to be detected in currently available observational data .",
    "future galaxy surveys such as the bigboss experiment @xcite and the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ; * ? ? ?",
