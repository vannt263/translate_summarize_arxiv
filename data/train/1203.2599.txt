    ". the effective thresholds @xmath74 and @xmath68 are parameters of the sum - rule method  related  to the specific realization of quark  hadron duality ; in general , they are _ not _ constant but depend on external kinematical variables @xcite .",
    "let us recall the important properties of the spectral densities on the right - hand sides of ( [ sr_p2 ] ) and ( [ 3pf ] ) : for  @xmath77 the ward identity relates the spectral densities @xmath58 and @xmath78 of two- and three - point functions  to  each  other : @xmath79 for @xmath12 and @xmath80 kept fixed , explicit calculations @xcite yield @xmath81 for the pion form factor @xmath0 on the left - hand side of ( [ sr_g4 ] ) two exact properties are known , namely , its normalization condition related to current conservation , requiring @xmath82 and the factorization theorem ( [ factorization ] ) .",
    "obviously , for @xmath83 the form factor @xmath0 extracted from the ld sum rule ( [ sr_g5 ] ) satisfies both of these rigorous constraints . at small  @xmath84",
    "we assume a freezing of @xmath85 at the level 0.3 , as is frequently done . at the intermediate @xmath5 , the effective threshold depends on @xmath5 and",
    "the pion form factor obtained from the ld sum rule depends on the details of @xmath39 .",
    "the `` conventional ld model '' _ assumes _ that reasonable predictions for the elastic form factor at not too small values of @xmath5 may be obtained by setting @xmath86 , see eq .",
    "( [ sld ] ) .",
    "although one has to invoke assumptions on behaviour of the effective threshold at the intermediate @xmath5 , some features of the pion form factor turn out to be largely independent of this assumption .",
    "so , let us look more carefully what is in fact conjectured in the ld sum rule and what may be predicted by this approach .    the sum rule ( [ sr_g5 ] ) for the pion form factor relies on two ingredients : first , on the _ rigorous calculation _ of the spectral densities of the perturbative - qcd diagrams ( recall that power corrections vanish in the ld limit @xmath26 ) ; second , on  the _ assumption _ of quark  hadron duality , which claims that the contributions of the hadronic continuum states may be well described by the diagrams of perturbation theory above some effective threshold @xmath68 .",
    "thus , the only  although really essential  unknown ingredient of the ld sum rule for the pion elastic from factor is this effective continuum threshold @xmath87 let us emphasize that , since the @xmath18 and @xmath37 contributions to the pion form factor are governed by one and the same effective threshold @xmath39 , the relative weights of these contributions may be _",
    "predicted_. their  ratio  @xmath88 turns out to be relatively stable with respect to @xmath68 and may therefore be calculated relatively accurately ( see fig .  [ plot:1d ] ) .",
    "ratio @xmath88 of @xmath18 and @xmath37 contributions to the pion elastic form factor vs.  @xmath5 for two reasonable  values of the  here by assumption constant  effective threshold @xmath68.,width=321 ]    quark  hadron duality implies that the effective threshold ( although being a function of @xmath5 ) always  i.e. ,  also for large @xmath5  stays in a region close to @xmath89 gev@xmath90 moreover , in order to satisfy the qcd factorization theorem for  the @xmath37 contribution to the form factor , the effective threshold should behave like @xmath91 for @xmath92 this requirement has immediate consequences for the large-@xmath5 behaviour of different contributions to the pion form factor :    \\1 .",
    "since @xmath39 is bounded from above , the @xmath18 contribution @xmath93 to the elastic form factor @xmath0 of  the  pion behaves like @xmath94 for @xmath92 we would like to emphasize that the decrease of the soft contribution to the pion elastic form factor like @xmath95 is a  direct consequence of perturbation theory and quark  hadron duality .",
    "\\2 . consequently , for large",
    "@xmath5 the pion elastic form factor @xmath0 is dominated by the @xmath37 contribution @xmath96    now , in the holographic models of @xcite merely the soft contribution is considered : it behaves like @xmath97 for large  @xmath5 .",
    "this is only possible if the effective threshold @xmath39 rises with @xmath70 however , this immediately leads to the violation of the factorization theorem for the @xmath37 contribution , which is governed by the same effective threshold .",
    "consequently , we would like to emphasize that the findings of @xcite would imply that the qcd factorization theorem is violated .",
    "we thus conclude that the predictions of @xcite for the pion form factor seem to us improbable . and the @xmath37 contributions to the pion form factor .",
    "this  seems , however , a rather artificial construction . ]",
    "let us now consider the amplitude of two - photon production from the vacuum induced by the axial - vector current  of nearly massless quarks of one flavour , @xmath100 , with @xmath101 denoting the photon polarization vectors : @xmath102 the amplitude @xmath103 is obtained from the vacuum expectation value of the @xmath104-product of two vector and one axial - vector currents and will be referred to as the @xmath98 amplitude .",
    "vector - current conservation yields the following relations : @xmath105 the general decomposition of the amplitude may be written as @xmath106 the form factor @xmath107 contains the contribution of the pseudoscalar meson of our interest @xcite such that @xmath108 we also consider the transition amplitude of the pseudoscalar current operator @xmath109 : @xmath110 the two - photon amplitude of the divergence of the axial current takes the form @xmath111 the case of our interest is @xmath112 , then the form factor @xmath113 does not contribute to the divergence . in perturbation theory ,",

    "the residue of this pole is again the axial - anomaly @xmath129 .",
    "notice however that the pole in the one - loop expression for @xmath107 disappears as soon as one of the photons is virtual @xcite .",
    "as is clear from ( [ 3.7 ] ) , the anomaly represents the integral of @xmath130 , the spectral density of the form factor @xmath107 .",
    "adler and bardeen @xcite tell us that the anomaly is non - renormalized by multiloop corrections .",
    "the easiest realization of this property would have been just the vanishing of multiloop contributions to the spectral density @xmath131 .",
    "an argument in favour of this possibility comes from explicit two - loop calculations @xcite which report the non - renormalizability of the full @xmath98 vertex to the two - loop accuracy .",
    "however , if so , the full form factor @xmath107 is given by its one - loop expression .",
    "then , this expression should develop the pion pole , known to be present in the full amplitude for any value of @xmath125 .",
    "but , obviously , this pole does not emerge in the one - loop expression for @xmath107 if @xmath132 !",
    "this requires that multiloop corrections to the form factor @xmath107 ( and , respectively , to its absorptive part @xmath131 ) do not vanish .",
    "then one may ask oneself how it may happen that the anomaly nevertheless remains non - renormalized by multiloop corrections ?",
    "the only possible answer we see @xcite is that the non - renormalization of the anomaly is reached due to some conspiral property of multiloop contributions to @xmath131 forcing their integral to vanish ( in fact , quite similar to the one - loop result : although the spectral density explicitly depends on @xmath124 and @xmath125 , its integral is an @xmath124- and @xmath125-independent constant ) .",
    "as is obvious from ( [ amp2 ] ) , the contribution of the light pseudoscalar constitutes a part of the form factor @xmath107 .",
    "the borel sum rule for the corresponding lorentz structure reads ( @xmath133 ) @xmath134 exploiting the concept of duality , the contribution of the excited states is assumed to be dual to the high - energy region of the diagrams of perturbation theory above an effective threshold @xmath68 .",
    "after that , setting the borel parameter @xmath26 we arrive at the ld sum rule for a pseudoscalar @xmath135-meson @xmath136 the spectral density @xmath130 to one - loop order is given by ( [ 1loop ] ) ; two - loop corrections were found to be absent @xcite .",
    "as discussed above , higher - loop corrections to @xmath130 can not vanish ; so the l.h.s . of ( [ ld1 ] )",
    "is known to @xmath137 accuracy .    in the chiral limit ,",
    "the ld expression for the form factor for the one - flavour case is particularly simple ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath138 we would like to emphasize that the effective threshold in ( [ ld ] ) depends on @xmath5 .",
    "apart from neglecting @xmath139 and higher - order corrections to the spectral density @xmath130 , no approximations have been done up to now : we have just considered the ld limit @xmath26 ; for an appropriate choice of @xmath39 the form factor may still be calculated exactly .",
    "approximations come into the game when we consider a model for @xmath39 .    independently of the behaviour of @xmath39 , the form factor at @xmath22",
    "is related to the axial anomaly : @xmath140 .",
    "qcd factorization requires @xmath141 for large @xmath5 .",
    "so , the simplest model compatible with this requirement is obtained by setting @xmath142 for _ all _ values of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this is the `` conventional ld model '' ( [ sld ] ) yielding for the neutral pion case the brodsky  lepage interpolating formula [ bl ] .",
    "form factor @xcite , the pseudoscalar meson is described by a set of distribution amplitudes of increasing twist which are treated as nonperturbative inputs . in our analysis , the deviation of the effective threshold @xmath39 from its asymptotic value @xmath143 corresponds to some extent to the contribution of higher - twist distribution amplitudes in the approach of @xcite . ]    as already pointed out above , the conventional ld model for the effective continuum threshold ( [ sld ] ) , defined by the  choice @xmath144 for all @xmath84 or a slightly more sophisticated approach of @xcite are approximations which do not account for subtle details of the confinement dynamics .",
    "consequently , it is important to understand the accuracy to be expected within this approach ; in other words , it is important to obtain some reliable estimate  of the expected deviations of the exact @xmath39 from its ld limit @xmath145 in the momentum region @xmath146@xmath147 gev@xmath4 . to this end , in the next section we take advantage of the fact that in quantum mechanics all the bound - state properties may be found  exactly  by solving the  schrdinger  equation . on the other hand , also in quantum mechanics we may construct ld sum rules .",
    "the relevance and the expected accuracy of the ld model may be tested in those cases where the form factor @xmath1 is known , i.e. , may be calculated by other theoretical approaches or measured experimentally .",
    "then , the exact effective  threshold may be reconstructed from ( [ ld ] ) , in this way probing the accuracy of the ld model .    to probe the accuracy of the ld model",
