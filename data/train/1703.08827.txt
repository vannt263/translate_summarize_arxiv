    "for convenience of the reader , we will first review several key facts from the theory of lvy processes , which will be required in our proof ( one may wish to consult the books @xcite and @xcite for more detailed information ) .",

    "we define a new process via @xmath105 the process @xmath106 is called a _ killed subordinator_. note that killed subordinators satisfy @xmath107 , thus the measures @xmath108 are sub - probability measures .",
    "any subordinator ( including killed ones ) can be described through an associated _ bernstein function _ @xmath109 via the identity @xmath110=\\int_{[0,\\infty ) } e^{-z x }",

    "the lvy - khintchine formula tells us that any bernstein function has an integral representation @xmath113 for some @xmath114 , @xmath115 and a positive measure @xmath116 , supported on @xmath117 , which satisfies the integrability condition @xmath118 .",
    "the constant @xmath119 is called _ the killing rate _ , @xmath120 is called _ the linear drift coefficient _ and the measure @xmath116 is called _ the lvy measure_. the lvy measure describes the distribution of jumps of the process @xmath100 .",
    "the killing rate and the drift can be recovered from the bernstein function as follows : @xmath121 see the excellent book @xcite for more information on bernstein functions .    in this paper we will only be working with a rather simple class of subordinators  the ones that have compound poisson jumps .",

    "the goal now is to use kendall s identity to find the distribution of @xmath137 .",
    "the calculation that follows will be very similar to the one performed in the proof proposition 3 in @xcite .",
    "first of all , we claim that for every @xmath140 the random variable @xmath137 has support on the set @xmath164 .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "if the spectrally negative process @xmath130 has no jumps before it hits level @xmath165 , then @xmath166 ; if @xmath136 has one jump of size @xmath167 before it hits the level @xmath165 , then @xmath168 ; if @xmath136 has two jumps of size @xmath167 and @xmath169 before it hits level @xmath165 , then @xmath170 , etc .",

    "our first goal is to extend this result to complex values of @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the key observation is that @xmath199 is a polynomial of @xmath200 whose roots are non - positive integers . writing this polynomial as a product of linear factors and applying the inequality @xmath201 ( with @xmath202 and @xmath203 ) to each linear factor , we deduce the upper bound @xmath204 and @xmath205 , it will converge uniformly for @xmath206 . from this fact",
