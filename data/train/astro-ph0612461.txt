    "recent estimates of the kerr parameters @xmath0 for two soft x - ray transients ( sxts ) @xcite , gro j1655@xmath140 ( nova sco ) and 4u 1543@xmath147 ( il lupi ) , facilitate a test of stellar evolution , in that the spins of the black holes in these binaries should be produced in common envelope evolution which begins with the evolving massive giant and companion donor , and ends up in helium - star ",
    "donor binary , the hydrogen envelope of the massive star having been stripped off and the helium having been burned .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter denoted as lbw ) assumed common envelope evolution to begin only after he core burning has been completed ; i.e. , case c mass transfer @xcite .",
    "otherwise the he envelope , if laid bare , would blow away to such an extent that the remaining core would not be sufficiently massive to evolve into a black hole @xcite .",
    "the black - hole - progenitor star , in which the helium core burning has been completed , is tidally locked with the donor ( secondary star ) so the spin period of the helium star is equal to the orbital period of the binary . in this tidal locking",
    ", lbw assumed uniform rotation of he star by assuming that the inner and outer parts of he are strongly connected due to the presence of a strong magnetic field .",
    "the c - o core of the helium star drops into a rapidly spinning black hole due to angular momentum conservation . in this process",
    ", the spin of the black hole depends chiefly on the mass of the donor because the orbital period chiefly depends on the donor mass as we explain later ( in section  [ sec - lmd2ham ] ) .",
    "lbw calculated this kerr parameter ( @xmath0 ) as a function of binary orbital period .",
    "the results are given in their fig .",
    "12 which we reproduce as fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] .",
    "the agreement of the natal kerr parameters with the @xcite measured ones means that only a small amount of angular momentum energy could have been lost after the formation of the black hole .",
    "the good agreement in this comparison supports the assumption of case c mass transfer and the tidal locking at the donor - he star stage assumed in the lbw calculations .    in the lbw calculation ,",
    "the @xmath0 for nova sco was slightly greater than for il lupi . combining this with observation",
    ", @xmath8 would be our best estimate for both binaries . in this report",
    "we also note that lbw predicted @xmath9 for 7 soft x - ray transient sources with main sequence companions and @xmath10 for xte j1550@xmath1564 and gs 2023@xmath11338 ( v404cygni ) with evolved companions .",
    "the maximum available energy in the blandford - znajek formalism for @xmath6 gives @xmath7ergs , orders of magnitude larger than observed in the grb and hypernova explosion .",
    "based on this observation , we interpret the soft x - ray transients to be relics of grbs and hypernovae .",
    "it should be noted that the way in which the hypernova explodes can be similar to the woosley collapsar model .",
    "the main advantage in our scenario is that the h envelope in our binary is removed by the donor and the rotational energy is naturally produced in the common envelope evolution .",
    "the necessity for case c mass transfer , given galactic metallicity , and the measured system velocity lock us into the kerr - parameter values we find .    in section  [ casec ]",
    "we elaborate on the determination of the kerr parameters of soft x - ray transient black - hole binaries discussed above , which could be read off the figures of lbw by a discussion of tidal locking , and the connection of tidal locking to case c mass transfer .",
    "we also discuss the energetics for grbs and hypernovae based on the black - hole spin . in section  [ sec - lmd2ham ] we show that the angular - momentum energy of the black - hole binary is determined mainly by the mass of the donor .",
    "we discuss 12 galactic transient sources with angular - momentum energies @xmath12ergs , so that all of these are relics of grbs and hypernovae .",
    "the energies of the grb and hypernova explosion powered by these , as we shall develop , should be subtracted from the natal rotational energies , to give the explosion energy .",
    "case c mass transfer implies that the mass transfer takes place late , after the he in the giant progenitor of the black hole has been burned .",
    "the proof of our scenario was given in the measured kerr parameters for nova sco and il lupi @xcite which agreed with the predictions of lbw .",
    "again , aside from the fact that we use the tidal coupling of the donor to spin of the black hole progenitor , the rest of our scenario , especially the collapse , is the same as in the woosley collapsar model .",
    "the grb and hypernova explosions are all of type @xmath13 , so that he lines do not appear . in the woosley collapsar model , he burning is not necessarily finished before explosion , but a ) the interacting he may fall into the black hole or , b ) the he may not mix with the @xmath14ni , so that in either case he lines would not be seen .",
    "we remark here that the explosion on which a record number ( 119 ) of astronomers concentrated their attention @xcite , sn2006aj was a @xmath15 explosion ; i.e. ( see additional information on @xcite ) convective carbon comes to an end just at the zams mass at which black holes begin to form , as explained in @xcite ( see fig.1 of that paper ) because the entropy loss by neutrino emission during convective carbon burning is shut off by the absence of carbon and the entropy that increases with zams mass must go into adding nucleons to the iron core of the star , before it collapses . the @xmath15 nature of the explosion identifies the central engine , therefore , as a black hole . in the 4 nature papers",
    "focussed on grb060218/sn2006aj the authors speculated on the central engine being a magnetar , but , in fact , it must have been a black hole and the grb and hypernova run by the blandford - znajek mechanism .",
    "otherwise there would have been carbon lines .",
    "in @xcite the black hole formation was described by a blaauw - boersma explosion , which should be sufficient for calculating the system velocity of the binary because conservation laws are respected .",
    "however , we believe the woosley collapsar model to give a more detailed description of the black hole formation and the hypernova explosion .",
    "the @xcite description includes magnetohydrodynamics in the form of the blandford - znajek mechanism",
    ". however , mass loss in the explosion and conservation laws are those of blaauw - boersma .",
    "lbw found that there are two classes of soft x - ray transients , those with main sequence companions ( denoted as aml ) , and others with evolved companions ( denoted as nu ) .",
    "due to the angular momentum loss , via gravitational wave radiation and magnetic braking , after black - hole formation the orbits of amls are shortened .",
    "based on this argument and the current observation , lbw traced back the orbital period at the time of black - hole formation in their fig .",
    "10 . by the tidal locking ,",
    "the estimated kerr parameters for amls are @xmath16 ( about half of them are @xmath17 ) .",
    "the maximum available energies for these system via the blandford - znajek formalism are @xmath18 ergs .",
    "so we believe that those black - hole binaries with main sequence companions are the relics of grbs and hypernovae .",
    "the evolution of nu s after black - hole formation is mainly controlled by the donor which is evolving beyond the main - sequence stage , and the orbit is widened due to the conservative mass transfer from the less massive donor to the black hole .",
    "we will discuss the possibilities of nu s as relics of grbs and hypernovae .",
    "we will be brief in reconstructing nova sco as a relic of grb and hypernova because this was constructed in considerable detail with assumed kerr parameter of @xmath19 in @xcite . with the smithsonian - harvard - mit measurement of @xmath20 we do nt need to change the brown et al .",
    "discussion by much .",
    "indeed , the smithsonian - harvard - mit @xmath21 gives its value after powering the grb and hypernova explosion , whereas the @xcite assumed value was before the explosion , so the two are not significantly different , since the explosion can be powered by the energy from an @xmath22 change in @xmath0 when @xmath0 is large .",
    "the hypernova aspect of the explosion in nova sco was clear by the accretion of @xmath23-particle nuclei onto the donor as a result of the hypernova explosion .",
    "@xcite found that o , mg , si and s have abundances on the f - star donor @xmath24 times solar .",
    "these nuclei were presumably absorbed by the donor , which acts as witness to the explosion .    due to the similarity in the orbital period between nova sco and il lupi as summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ( lbw ) , we argue that il lupi is also a relic of grb and hypernova .",
    "although the black hole masses are not known as well in xte j1550@xmath1564 and gs 2023@xmath11338 ( v404 cygni ) , it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] that using their reconstructed preexplosion periods they have a kerr parameter of @xmath25 , possibly somewhat less definite than the prediction of the @xmath21 for nova sco .",
    "the latter two binaries have black holes with nearly double the mass as the first two , and , therefore , larger accretion disks . from our arguments , in appendix  [ app2 ] , we believe that they may be able to accept more rotational energy , which could be checked by subtracting the measured kerr parameters from the natal ones .",
    "@xcite remarked that for nova sco _  after the first second the newly evolved black hole has @xmath26erg of rotational energy available to power these .",
    "the time scale for delivery of this energy depends ( inversely quadratically ) on the magnitude of the magnetic field in the neighborhood of the black hole , essentially that on the inner accretion disk .",
    "the developing supernova explosion disrupts the accretion disk ; this removes the magnetic fields anchored in the disk , and self - limits the energy the blandford - znajek mechanism can deliver . \"",
    "_ this , together with the total rate of creations of binaries of our type of @xmath27galaxy@xmath28yr@xmath28 estimated by @xcite will be shown in section  [ sec - pop ] to reproduce the population of subluminous bursts in nearby galaxies .",
    "it is clear that they are subluminous , at least in the cases of nova sco and il lupi because their kerr parameters measured by the smithsonian - harvard coalition are indistinguishable from the natal predicted @xmath29 within observational errors .",
    "the disruption of the black hole disk will be discussed in detail in appendix  [ app2 ] .",
    "our evolution of black hole binaries in our galaxy might appear to be irrelevant for the long ( high luminosity ) @xmath30-ray bursts because @xcite show that these come chiefly from low metallicity , very massive stars in galaxies of limited chemical evolution , quite unlike our milky way .",
    "however , we can construct a quantitative theory of the rotational energies of the black holes which power the central engine for the grbs and hypernovae in our galaxy because we can calculate the black hole kerr parameters . having this quantitative theory",
    "it is straightforward to apply it to explosions in low metallicity galaxies , the high luminosities resulting because the donors are more massive than those in our galaxy and can accept more rotational energy from the binary than the high metallicity binaries with low mass donors , although there may be some overlap of the high metallicity stars with the same mass donor as the low metallicity stars , as we shall discuss .",
    "we predict that this will be so with xte j1550 - 564 ( v383 normae ) , in which the kerr parameter will be measured ( j. mcclintock , private communication ) so that with our calculation presented here we will be able to obtain the energy used up in the explosion which should be nearly that of cosmological ( high luminosity ) grbs .",
    "recently the eclipsing massive black hole binary x@xmath17 has been discovered in the nearby spiral galaxy messier 33 @xcite .",
    "since the metallicity is @xmath31 solar , we believe it to mimic low metallicity stars which are more massive than the galactic ones .",
    "the donor has mass @xmath32 now , possibly @xmath33 earlier .",
    "we expect that this system may have gone through a dark explosion due to the high donor mass , which implies a low rotational energy as we discuss in next section .",
    "a highly relevant discussion for the v4641 sgr evolution , which will be a template of an earlier grs 1915@xmath11105 development was given by @xcite , for cyg x@xmath11 .",
    "they discussed the latter as if the donor and black hole were very nearly equal in mass which we shall show will happen in the future for cyg x@xmath11 , although its donor is now @xmath34 and black hole @xmath35 .",
    "the donor could have been substantially more massive when the black hole was born after common envelope evolution and lost mass by wind .",
    "the donor in @xcite had a stellar wind of @xmath36  yr@xmath28 @xcite throughout the evolution .",
    "once the mass of the donor became reduced to a mass comparable to the mass of the black hole , the donor established thermal equilibrium and filled its roche lobe transferring mass at the rate of @xmath37yr@xmath28 . because of the continuing wind loss the donor shrank significantly below its roche lobe and the system widened .",
    "the donor started to expand again after it had exhausted all of the hydrogen in the core and filled its roche lobe a second time .",
    "in this phase the mass transfer reached a second peak of @xmath38  yr@xmath28 , where mass transfer was driven by the evolution of the h - burning shell .",
    "the most interesting feature of this calculation was that the system became detached after the first initial time scale because of the stellar wind from the donor .",
    "since the donor is close to filling its roche lobe , such a wind may be focussed towards the accreting black hole , as is inferred from the tomographic analysis of the mass flow in cyg x-1 by @xcite .",
    "@xcite decompose the stellar wind of the supergiant into two moments , one representing the approximately spherically symmetrical part of the wind and the second representing the focussed enhancement of wind density in the direction of the black hole .",
    "the latter component of the wind transferred mass in an essentially conservative way ( although the former would bring about mass loss ) .",
    "we shall use the wind in both , v4641 sgr and grs 1915@xmath11105 , to accrete matter from the donor to the black hole later on .",
    "note that the wind , transferring matter at hypercritical ( much greater than eddington ) rate basically shuts off the initial roche lobe overflow , because it can transfer mass sufficiently by itself .",
    "the second period of roche lobe overflow transfer is driven by the evolution of the h - burning shell ; i.e. , by the secondary star going red giant .",
    "@xcite say that  irrespective of whether this particular model is applicable to cyg x@xmath11 , the calculation ... illustrates that it is generally more likely to observe a high - mass black - hole x - ray binary in the relatively long - lived wind mass - transfer phase following the initial thermal timescale phase which only lasts a few @xmath39 yr . in this example , the wind phase lasts a few @xmath40 yr , but it could last as long as a few @xmath41 yr if the secondary were initially less evolved . \"",
    "we believe the above scenario to apply not only to cyg x@xmath11 , v4641 sgr and grs 1915@xmath11105 , but also to lmc x@xmath13 and m33 x@xmath17 , binaries with donors more massive than the black - hole companion .",
    "we find that these all had dark explosions , as we develop below , basically because the donor had too high a mass at the time of the explosion to give an energetic grb .",
    "we suggest that the wind in these cases may resemble the tidal stream of @xcite . in the two - dimension system studied by these authors , they show that when @xmath42 becomes less than @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the distance between o - star and black hole and @xmath45 is the radius of the primary ( or accreting ) star , the tidally - enhanced - wind accretion exceeds bondi - hoyle accretion , a factor that increases to several as @xmath42 decreases .",
    "we are thus now able , given the evolution of @xcite , to describe in detail the crude mass transfer used in the evolution of grs 1915@xmath11105 by @xcite , as conservative mass transfer in wind .",
    "we disagree , however , with the procedure of @xcite to limit the accretion to eddington .",
    "obviously there is no surface in the black hole onto which the binding energy of the infalling matter can be accreted and then furnish photons etc . which will be emitted so as to impede the other infalling matter .",
    "in fact , once the matter goes across the event horizon it can no longer influence the matter that has not . in the case of 1915@xmath11105 , @xcite found the average mass transfer rate to be @xmath46yr@xmath28 , about 200 times eddington ( see @xcite p.355 ) .    none of the three binaries we consider had appreciable natal @xmath21 s because of the high masses of the donors ( secondary stars ) .",
    "thus , we can see that the high kerr parameter must come from mass accretion ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - a ] ) and that the accreted mass must be slightly greater than the natal mass in order to have such a high kerr parameter for grs 1915@xmath11105 . taking the final black hole mass to be @xmath47 we need a natal mass of @xmath48 .",
    "if v4641 sgr is to be a template for grs 1915@xmath11105 , then its black hole should have had a mass of @xmath48 when born , which would have evolved to its present value of @xmath49 by accretion by wind from the donor .",
    "thus , the present @xmath50 donor and @xmath49 black hole will have essentially interchanged masses from the time of the birth of the black hole until present , through mass exchange from the donor to the black hole .",
    "as outlined in lbw , v4641 sgr will transfer by wind another @xmath51 from donor to black hole to reach the present grs 1915@xmath11105 with black hole mass @xmath47 .",
    "thus , the total mass accreted by grs 1915@xmath11105 is estimated to be @xmath52 .",
    "the companion mass evolved in this way is @xmath53 , somewhat larger than the @xcite mass of @xmath54 .",
    "some mass is , however , lost in jets , which is not taken into account in our approximation of conservative mass transfer .",
    "our evolution of the black hole birth is similar to the second evolution version of @xcite which would give the right chemical abundances to the secondary star in v4641 sgr .",
    "these investigators suggested that the black hole mass at birth was @xmath55 , and to obtain the right surface abundances they proposed that the explosion was a dark one ; i.e. , one of low energy .",
    "@xcite suggest that the explosion in cyg x@xmath11 was a dark explosion , much less energetic than the one in nova sco .",
    "we shall see that the explosions are dark because the donors ( secondary stars ) have high masses .",
    "we will construct spin energies for the transient sources in the next section , but we want to make some general comments here .",
    "the question with grbs is whether there is enough angular momentum to power the grb and hypernova explosion . in the case of the widely accepted theory , woosley s collapsars",
    ", this question is unanswered , although one may take the point of view that we observe grbs and hypernova explosions , so there must be enough angular momentum , which is an integral part of the mechanism .",
    "none the less , @xcite say  when recent estimates of magnetic torques @xcite are added , however , the evolved cores spin an order of magnitude slower .",
    "this is still more angular momentum than observed in young pulsars , but too slow for the collapsar model for gamma - ray bursts . \"",
    "furthermore , the usual scenarios for the interactions of wolf - rayets with other stars is that they slow down the rotation .",
    "the above arguments in support of the binary model which was used in @xcite , were made in @xcite , and applied to galactic transient sources .",
    "the hypernova formed in 1998bw had @xmath56ergs in energy @xcite .",
    "in addition , the jet formation in the grb requires lifting all of the matter out of the way of the jet .",
    "@xcite estimates that this costs @xmath57ergs in kinetic energy . at early times the thermal and kinetic energies in supernova explosions are roughly equal , satisfying equipartition .",
    "we believe this to be at least roughly true in our explosions here , so that @xmath58ergs would be needed for 980425/sn1998bw and possibly morec@xmath59 would be @xmath60ergs .",
    "note that this energy is  invisible \" , and is not normally included in estimates of grb energies . ] , because @xcite describes 980425 as a  smothered \" explosion .",
    "as noted in appendix of brown , lee and moreno mndez , the blandford - znajek efficiency drops substantially as the kerr parameter decreases below @xmath61 .",
    "thus , the available rotational energy will decrease rapidly with increasing donor mass . in appendix",
    "[ app2 ] we will estimate that the highest rotational energy of @xmath58ergs can be accepted by a binary with a @xmath62 donor .",

    "the energy used up in the explosion was tiny compared with the initial rotational energy , but this must change as the initial rotational energy decreases , and black hole mass increases .",
    "we have shown that galactically there are 12 relics of grbs and hypernova explosions , and that 3 ( xte j1819@xmath1254 , grs 1915@xmath11105 , cyg x@xmath11 ) might have gone through a low - energy dark explosion , although the first two of these may have gone through grbs and hypernova explosions .",

    "it seems reasonable that the blandford - znajek mechanism is dismantled .",

    "the question then is , what is the latter ?",
    "we know that sn1998bw had a hypernova energy of @xmath169bethe . from the equipartition of energy , we would estimate the kinetic energy to clear out a path for the jet in the grb to be about equal to the thermal energy , which is roughly true in @xcite .",

    "however , the decrease in kerr parameter necessary to go from 300 to 240bethes is only @xmath172 from our natal @xmath61 , or @xmath173 , which requires an accurate measurement in kerr parameter , but is none the less much larger than the @xmath174 decrease estimated for nova sco .",
    "( note that for schwarzschild black holes , the rotational energy goes approximately as @xmath175 . ) on the other hand , this may be the minimal difference between natal and present angular momentum energies because no other model leaves the system spinning so rapidly .",
    "thus , if no difference is conclusively seen because observational errors are @xmath173 then this is also very interesting .",
    "suppose a decrease of more than @xmath176 is seen .",
    "then this means that we have underestimated the energy of the explosion , but our above estimates are as large as any proposed ones . in any case , the possibility that the system , following the explosion , is left rotating is a new and interesting one .",
    "we thus see that we can fit the @xcite condition for no high luminosity grbs in our high metallicity stars in it , because all of the donor masses of the grbs that received the highest rotational energies had companion masses of @xmath107 and the rotational energy furnished to them was so great that the accretion disks were dismantled .",
    "the result is that the grbs were subluminous , like the vast majority of grbs .",
    "the @xmath168 times larger surface area should be helpful in allowing xte 1550@xmath1564 to accept the rotational energy , but the amount is still tremendous .",
    "we do not have any donors of @xmath142 in our galaxy , but such a donor would bring the energy down by @xmath177 , since it goes inversely with donor mass , to @xmath170bethes , that we estimate for grb 980425 , which as noted has nearly galactic metallicity . although grb 980425 is essentially  smothered \" @xcite , @xmath178bethes is the highest energy anyone has attributed to the grb and hypernova explosion .",
    "thus , our estimates would say that donors of @xmath142 would give the most luminous grbs , and that xte 1550@xmath1564 may or may not have been able to accept @xmath170bethes , but since we view this as an upper limit , this binary should still be spinning furiously .",
    "we should enter a proviso here .",
    "our main thesis is that the black hole binary must have a donor sufficiently massive to slow it down enough so that the black hole can accept the strong magnetic coupling through its accretion disk without the rayleigh - taylor instability entering . by increasing the area of the accretion disk by a factor @xmath168 in going from the @xmath142 black hole in nova sco , to the @xmath35 black hole in xte 1550@xmath1564 the density of magnetic coupling",
    "is decreased by a factor @xmath168 . however , the donor in xte 1550@xmath1564 is only @xmath179 , about the same size as in nova sco . therefore , the grb in xte 1550@xmath1564 may still have been subluminous , but less so than nova sco because of the larger disk area .",
    "the donor masses at the time of common envelope evolution of xte 1819@xmath1254 and grs 1915@xmath11105 were @xmath180 .",
    "however they have only @xmath181 of the energy of the binary with @xmath62 donor , @xmath182bethes .",
    "these black holes accrete a lot of matter , more than doubling the black hole mass in the case of grs 1915@xmath11105 and , ultimately will double that mass in xte 1819@xmath1254 . such binaries with substantial mass exchange do not obey our simple scaling which is designed for natal angular momentum . they must be evolved in detail .",
    "we believe , that similar evolutionary arguments will apply to binaries with higher mass donors , and , anyway , the angular momentum energy will be cut down by the higher donor masses .",
    "thus we expect that only binaries with donor masses @xmath142 will give highly luminous grbs with rotational energy @xmath170bethes . in a very rough estimate , using a flat distribution of donors with mass up to @xmath141 we can estimate that the number of cosmological grbs , those with high luminosity will be @xmath183 of the total , not far from the ratio of grbs with high luminosity to subluminous ones found by @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "the commonly accepted estimates of the explosion energies in grbs are orders of magnitude less than the natal angular momentum energy in nova sco .",
    "the measured kerr parameter of @xmath151 @xcite has a present rotational energy indistinguishable from the natal one , within error bars .",
    "however , the dismantling of the accretion disk from the very high magnetic couplings should be less in xte j1550@xmath1564 and the rotational energy is somewhat less , the donor being about the mass of the he star in the woosley collapsar model , so we propose that xte j1550@xmath1564 can accept substantial rotation energy but probably less than the energy of a cosmological grb .",
