    "recent experimental progress in producing and controlling highly excited atomic and molecular aggregates have triggered a number of experimental and theoretical works on interacting rydberg systems.@xcite one of the most prominent phenomena observable in such systems is the dipole blockade , @xcite which is a consequence of effective interactions between atoms in rydberg states with principal quantum numbers @xmath2.@xcite the physical reason for the blockade can be summarized as follows : the large dipole moment of a rydberg atom induces sizeable energy level shifts in the atoms in its vicinity . as a result , atoms within a certain blockade radius @xmath3 can not be excited , even though they are subjected to the same electromagnetic field as the proper rydberg atoms .",
    "typical experiments are conducted on atom ensembles at ultralow temperatures and probe these systems on timescales during which almost no particle movement is possible .",
    "therefore , the cloud of atoms can be considered as ` frozen ' in a more or less disordered constellation.@xcite after the required fine - tuned electromagnetic fields are switched on , a number of atoms undergo a transition into the highly excited rydberg states .",
    "if @xmath3 is larger than the average interatomic distance , only a fraction of the atoms can be excited , while the rest remains in the ground state due to the blockade effect .",
    "the spatial arrangement of the rydberg atoms within the cloud has very interesting features . in ref .",
    "[ ] , the concept of a rydberg crystal was put forward .",
    "the blockade region formed around an excited atom can be modeled as an effective repulsive interaction between the rydberg atoms .",
    "it might be responsible for an emergent long - range order of the wigner crystal type@xcite .",
    "however , its detection is extremely difficult . the primary method for detecting long - range order is spectroscopy , which is difficult to reliably realize in experiments.@xcite other experiments benefit from the low ionization energy of the rydberg atoms by ( pulsed ) electric field ionization ( cf .",
    "e.g. [ ] ) . in this paper",
    "we propose a statistical method of detecting and analyzing the physical properties of the rydberg crystallization phenomenon and discuss its predictive power .",
    "the idea roots in the experimental procedure itself .",
    "a typical measurement cycle starts with the generation of an ultracold atomic cloud and the subsequent excitation of a fraction of the atoms to a rydberg state .",
    "afterwards , measurements are performed , during which the rydberg atoms are eventually de - excited .",
    "then , the system is ready for another preparation.@xcite an important point is that the experiments are performed with the same number of atoms and using the same electromagnetic fields in every cycle .",
    "however , since the arrangement of atoms varies between cycles , it is necessary to calculate statistical averages of the observables of interest .",
    "the simplest observable is the number of rydberg atoms @xmath1 in the cloud .",
    "the fact that for a given @xmath1 , a regular arrangement of the rydberg atoms on a lattice minimizes their interaction energy , should be visible in the probability distribution @xmath0 .",
    "as we shall show below there are indeed differences between the histograms for crystallized and random phases . however , the pair correlation function turns out to possess even higher predictive power .",
    "@xcite    this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we shall introduce the model and connect its parameters to possible experimental setups .",
    "we shall define the relevant observables and explain the details of our numerical implementation .",
    "the results of the calculation together with a thorough analysis of the arising features is contained in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "section [ sec : sumandcon ] is devoted to the summary of results .",
    "we assume that in every measurement cycle the system consists of @xmath4 atoms located at randomly chosen positions @xmath5 , uniformly distributed over the entire system volume . , which used a lattice .",
    "] we focus on the case of a frozen rydberg gas , where the kinetic energy is negligible .",
    "each of the atoms can either be excited to a rydberg state or stay in its ground state .",
    "since the electrostatic properties do not depend on the details of the rydberg states , each atom can be modeled as a two - level system , and we describe the ensemble as a set of @xmath4 randomly arranged , interacting spin-@xmath6 systems . hence , the hamiltonian reads@xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 denote the pauli matrices .",
    "this can be interpreted as a generalized spin-@xmath6 quantum ising model .",
    "@xmath9 is the frequency of the exciting laser and , in the spin language , represents a magnetic field perpendicular to the quantization axis , which we chose to be the @xmath10-axis .",
    "the detuning , i.e. , the difference between the laser frequency to the resonance frequency of the rydberg state , is denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "it corresponds to a magnetic field applied in @xmath10-direction .",
    "the third parameter , @xmath12 , indicates the strength of an effective interaction between excited atoms and causes the dipole blockade explained above.@xcite we note that we are only interested in the case @xmath13 , because otherwise it is energetically not favorable to excite atoms .",
    "this allows us to use @xmath11 as a basic energy scale .",
    "an adequate modeling of the system also requires geometrical constraints describing the trap potentials . in the following",
    "we shall consider different scenarios : ( i ) a 1d system with open boundaries , ( ii ) a 3d system with open boundaries , ( iii ) a 1d system with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "options ( i ) and ( ii ) are very natural models for realistic experiments , but make it difficult to extrapolate the presented numerical results towards realistic system sizes . option ( iii ) , on the other hand , is perfectly suitable for the calculation of correlation functions and is easily scalable to large system lengths .",
    "the crucial feature of our 1d model is a rather large `` coordination number '' , i.e. , the number of atoms which interact significantly with any given rydberg atom .",
    "this feature is shared by any generic 3d realization of the system up to some irrelevant spatial distribution parameter .",
    "that is why we believe that the physics in 3d is expected to be very similar to our 1d model .",
    "just as in the actual experiments we calculate averages over the large number of different , randomly sampled atom arrangements . in every cycle",
    "the effective model is a long - range quantum ising model with a set of coupling constants generated by the atom positions @xmath14 . for every such constellation ,",
    "we determine the ground state and evaluate the number of rydberg atoms @xmath1 ( which is equivalent to the magnetization in the ising model ) , the density profile and correlation functions .",
    "the most difficult task is finding the ground state .",
    "we use one method , numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix , in three different variations . for small atom numbers ( @xmath15 )",
    "the hamiltonian can be diagonalized exactly . for larger numbers of atoms ( @xmath16 ) ,",
    "we truncate the hilbert space in different ways in order to speed up the numerical diagonalization",
    ". on the one hand , this truncation can be done by only keeping states in which the number of rydberg atoms @xmath1 remains below a certain threshold @xmath17 .",
    "a different approach is to only use the basis states with the lowest energy expectation values to create an effective hamiltonian , which is then diagonalized .",
    "we checked the reliability of both procedures by changing the respective cutoff parameter .    to calculate the number of rydberg atoms and the correlation function we proceed as follows .",
    "for a given random distribution of atoms , the hamiltonian matrix is expressed in a basis consisting of states in which an integer number of atoms is in the rydberg state while the rest is in the ground state .",
    "the corresponding hilbert space is then truncated as explained above , and the smallest eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenvector ( the ground state @xmath18 ) are obtained numerically .",
    "the number of rydberg atoms in the ground state is now found from @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the dimension of the truncated hilbert space , @xmath21 the number of rydberg atoms in the basis state @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the overlap between @xmath22 and the ground state .",
    "one easy way of numbering the basis states is to assign a `` 1 '' to a rydberg atom and a `` 0 '' to a ground state atom . in this way",
    ", every basis state can be uniquely mapped to the binary representation of a number @xmath24 .",
    "furthermore , we calculate the pair correlation function @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the number of rydberg atoms in a volume element @xmath27 around the point @xmath28 .",
    "the first step is to divide the interval of possible distances between two atoms ( @xmath29 $ ] for periodic boundary conditions ) into @xmath30 subintervals of equal length .",
    "calculating the ground state @xmath18 for a given distribution of atoms yields the coefficients @xmath31 .",
    "now , we consider a single pair of atoms and measure their distance in the current distribution of atoms .",
    "this distance lies within one of the aforementioned subintervals . to the value which is already stored for this subinterval",
    "we now add the sum of all @xmath32 that correspond to a basis state in which both of the atoms of the considered pair are in the rydberg state . after repeating this procedure for every possible pair of atoms we start over by generating a new random distribution .",
    "the cumulative sum of all samples treated this way then gives the total correlation function for a given set of parameters .",
    "let us first discuss the simplest case of a noninteracting system , @xmath33 . in this case , the problem is exactly solvable and the number of rydberg atoms is given by    @xmath34    in the noninteracting limit , this value is independent of the positions @xmath14 of the atoms .",
    "therefore , the histogram @xmath0 becomes trivial , @xmath35 .",
    "the density distribution @xmath36 , averaged over many realizations , is uniform , and the pair correlation function @xmath37 is constant .",
    "the situation changes drastically for any nonzero @xmath12 .",
    "figure  [ fig : densitydistribution3dblue ] shows the data for the density distribution @xmath38 in 1d and 3d systems with open boundaries . while for weak interactions the rydberg atoms tend to populate the boundaries , in the case of strong interactions a sizeable fraction of the atoms is redistributed towards the system s bulk , indicating that long - range order is established in the system .",
    "as we are dealing with a system with long - range interactions , the numerical complexity is determined by the number of rydberg atoms and not by the precise geometry of the system . on the other hand ,",
    "going to higher dimensions at fixed atom number @xmath4 increases the surface / bulk ratio and thus makes the detection of long - range order more cumbersome .",
    "therefore we shall concentrate on ( quasi)-1d systems from now on .",
    "nonetheless , we have conducted a number of simulations on 3d systems and found comparable results , see e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : densitydistribution3dblue ] for the density profile of a 3d system .",
    "we also would like to remark that an experimentally realizable cigar - shaped confining potential ( with a typical radius smaller than @xmath3 ) can be very well be approximated by the ( quasi)-1d geometry considered here .     and",
