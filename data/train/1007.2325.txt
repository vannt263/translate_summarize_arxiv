    "after the discovery that the cosmic expansion is accelerating @xcite and the first cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) observations of a flat universe @xcite , the current standard model of cosmology implies the existence of dark energy which accounts for about 70% of the total energetic content of the universe , which according to the observations is spatially flat @xcite .",
    "the nature of the dark energy is still a mystery ( see for instance the review of @xcite ) .",
    "several models have been proposed to explain dark energy @xcite .",
    "an alternative consists to consider a phenomenological decaying dark energy density with continuous creation of photons @xcite or matter @xcite .",
    "the dark energy might decay slowly in the course of the cosmic evolution and thus provide the source term for matter and radiation .",
    "different such models have been discussed and strong constraints come from very accurate measurements of the cmb .",
    "cmb is the best evidence for an expanding universe starting from an initial high density state . within the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw )",
    "models of the universe the radiation after decoupling expands adiabatically and scales as @xmath5 , @xmath6 being the redshift . depending on the decay mechanism of the dark energy the created photons could lead to distortions in the planck spectrum of the cmb . if the dark energy is considered as a second fluid component transferring energy continuously to the material component , the second law of thermodynamics constrains the whole process in such a way that the temperature law , that is how the temperature of the cmb changes with time , can be determined .",
    "such a model has been discussed in detail by lima @xcite , who also established under which conditions the equilibrium relations are preserved .",
    "he also introduced the concept of an `` adiabatic '' vacuum decay . in a further paper lima et al .",
    "@xcite following the approach outlined in @xcite derived a temperature redshift relation law @xmath7 assuming a nonvanishing source term in the balance equation for particle number , which depends on a function @xmath8 assumed to be constant .",
    "this parameter can then be determined by fitting the temperature redshift relation to the data . however , being a purely phenomenological parameter it can not be related to more fundamental quantities such as for instance the effective equation of state of the dark fluid @xmath0 .    in this paper",
    "we follow the same approach by lima @xcite , we do not restrict to the case of a universe dominated by a radiation fluid as in @xcite , since we leave the adiabatic index @xmath1 ( which appears in the equation of state of the fluid including both matter and radiation ) free to vary and in particular we do not adopt their simplifying assumption of a constant @xmath8 and thus we derive a temperature redshift relation for cmb which depends on more fundamental quantities such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we compare our temperature redshift relation with the available data on the cmb temperature as a function of the redshift obtained from sunyaev - zeldovich observations and at higher redshift from quasar absorption line spectra .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in   [ sec : theory ] we will introduce the theoretical background for our model , deriving the main quantities of interest . in   [ sec : data ] the multi - redshift measurements of the cmb temperature are presented , while  [ sec : discussion ] and  [ sec : conclusions ] are devoted to the discussion of the results , conclusions and future prospects .",
    "we assume the usual friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmology and that the material medium of the universe contains three different components : a fluid , which includes radiation and matter ( both baryonic and dark matter ) as particular cases , for which we have the law    @xmath9    with @xmath1 in the interval [ 0 - 2 ] .",
    "further we assume a dark energy , quintessence - like @xmath10 component , with pressure @xmath11 and density @xmath12 and a bare cosmological constant @xmath13 . with these components we get for the einstein field equations    @xmath14    @xmath15    where a dot means time derivative . for the dark energy we assume the relation @xmath16 ( thus setting @xmath17 ) to hold .",
    "this is for instance the case for quintessence models in the limit where the scalar field does not depend on time and thus its time derivative vanishes . in the later stages of the universe",
    "the time dependence is possibly very weak so that @xmath17 holds up to small corrections , which we will neglect in the following , thus simplifying our calculations .",
    "this can be viewed as a first order approximation .",
    "furthermore , we assume that there is no curvature , thus @xmath18 , and take the sum of eqs .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) and ( [ 12 ] ) . this way we get    @xmath19    following the paper by lima et al .",
    "@xcite the energy conservation equation can be written as    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the hubble parameter and    @xmath22    is a term which depends on the dark fluid and acts as a source term for the @xmath1-fluid energy .",
    "evidently , if no interaction between the different fluids exists , then @xmath23 is null and the standard picture is recovered .",
    "@xmath23 can describe different physical situations such as for instance a thermogravitational quantum creation theory @xcite or a quintessence scalar field cosmology @xcite .",
    "assuming as mentioned above the relation @xmath16 and writing @xmath24 , we have @xmath25 on the other hand the equation for the particle number density is given by    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the particle number density and @xmath28 is the particle source term . using gibbs law and well - known thermodynamic identities , following the derivation given in the paper by lima et al .",

    "whereas to carry out the integration of the first term on the right hand side it is useful to perform a change of variable from @xmath46 to @xmath6 and accordingly @xmath47 .",
    "this way we get ( with @xmath48 corresponding to the time @xmath43 and @xmath49 corresponding to @xmath42 present time )    @xmath50    where @xmath51 denotes derivative with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "we now assume a power law model for the @xmath52 term , thus @xmath53 or @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is a constant , which is @xmath56 @xcite , if the `` bare '' cosmological constant @xmath13 vanishes .",
    "for such a model the hubble parameter as a function of @xmath57 can be computed @xcite and leads to    @xmath58^{1/2}~ , \\label{ma}\\ ] ]    where @xmath59 is related to the present value of the total matter density : @xmath60 , with @xmath61 . due to the negligible energy density accounted for by the radiation",
    ", this term has been neglected here .",
    "as next we insert @xmath62 and its derivative as taken from eq.([ma ] ) into eq.([16 ] ) and integrate it , to get ( setting @xmath63 )    @xmath64    where @xmath65~.\\label{ma2}\\ ] ]    we can also write eq.([ma1 ] ) as @xmath66 we inserted in the exponent of eq.([ma1 ] ) the explicit form of @xmath55 , thus getting as exponent in the above eq .",
    "notice that for @xmath68 : @xmath69 , whereas for @xmath70 the expression in the parenthesis is equal to 1 and thus @xmath71 , which for the canonical value of @xmath3 reduces to the standard expression . also for @xmath72 , although not a realistic value , the expression in the parenthesis is non - singular and equal to : @xmath73 .    since from the analysis by ma",
    "@xcite we expect @xmath57 to be small we give here an expression for @xmath74 , where we keep only the leading linear terms in the expansion in @xmath57 and neglect all terms of higher order .",
    "this way we get from eq .",
    "( [ ma3 ] )    @xmath75    if @xmath57 is positive , then the dark energy slowly decreases as a function of the cosmic time , whereas if @xmath57 is negative the inverse process happens .",
    "it is easy to calculate the equivalent effective dark energy equation of state @xmath76 with @xmath77 .",
    "if @xmath78 then we have @xmath79 , i.e. our model is quintessence - like @xcite , while we have a phantom - like @xcite model when @xmath57 is negative and @xmath80 .",
    "another interesting quantity is the deceleration parameter , which can be written as @xmath81 imposing that @xmath82 , we can determine the _ transition redshift _ , i.e. the redshift when the universe was changing from a deceleration to an acceleration phase , which is given by @xmath83 from this result we have that the larger @xmath57 is , the earlier the universe changes from deceleration to acceleration .",
    "to test the decaying @xmath52 model we will rely on the cmb temperatures derived from the absorption lines of high redshift systems and the ones from sunyaev - zeldovich effect in clusters of galaxies ( we will collectively quote as @xmath85 , hereafter ) .",
    "we can infer the cmb temperature at high redshift from the analysis of quasar absorption line spectra which give atomic or ionic fine structure levels excited by the photo - absorption of the cosmic microwave background radiation .",
    "detection of absorption from the ground states and excited of c@xmath86 in damped ly@xmath87 system towards quasars permits to estimate the population ratio of the excited fine - structure levels , and thus to derive the cmb temperature at the redshift of the damped ly@xmath87 system .",

    "@xcite detected absorption lines in an isolated gas cloud toward pks1232 + 0815 , with which they could get the following limits on the cmb temperature    @xmath89    and molaro et al .",
    "@xcite in the damped ly@xmath87 system toward qso 0347 - 3819 gave    @xmath90    the cosmic microwave background can also excite levels of molecular species , when the energy separation involved corresponds to the cmb peak frequency .",
    "we know that molecular gas is an important ingredient of star formation .",
    "damped ly@xmath87 absorbers ( i.e. dlas ) are generally taken as seeds of present - day galaxies , and for this reason dlas can be considered as an important gas reservoir for star formation .",
    "h@xmath91 , the most abundant molecules in the universe is a good candidate ( see puy et al .",
    "@xcite , galli & palla @xcite and stancil et al .",
    "the search of h@xmath91 in dlas can be carried out by observing the h@xmath91 absorption lines in the lyman x@xmath92@xmath93",

    "cui et al .",

    "we notice also that since the best fit value for @xmath57 is small , it implies that the dark energy variation with time is very slow ( at least when not considering too high @xmath6 values , where we expect our approximations to break down ) and thus our assumption on @xmath17 can be considered as justified a posteriori .",
