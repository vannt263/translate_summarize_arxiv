    "the goal of statistical mechanics is , starting from the microscopic natural rules ( classical , relativistic , quantum mechanics , chromodynamics ) and adequately using probability theory , to arrive to the thermodynamical relations . along these connections between the macro- and micro- worlds",
    ", the ultimate link is made through the fundamental concept of  _ entropy_.",
    "this finding , accomplished against a stream of criticism , surely is one of the most powerful and fruitful breakthroughs of the history of physical sciences .",
    "it was achieved by boltzmann in the last three decades of the nineteenth century .",
    "his result , currently known by every pure and applied scientist , and carved on his tombstone in vienna , namely , @xmath9 is the mathematical link between the microscopically fine description ( represented by  @xmath10 , the total number of accessible microscopic states of the system ) and the macroscopic measurable quantities ( represented by the entropy @xmath11 , the very same quantity introduced by clausius in order to complete thermodynamics ! ) .",
    "apparently , eq .   has been explicitly stated in this form for the first time by planck , but it was definitively known by boltzmann and is carved in his tombstone in vienna . the index  @xmath12 stands for gibbs , who put boltzmann s ideas forward and overspread the ( classical ) statistical mechanics concepts through his seminal book  @xcite .",
    "equation   is a particular instance of a more general one , namely @xmath13 when every microstate is equally probable , _",
    "i.e. _ , when @xmath14 , we recover eq . .",
    "evidently quantum mechanics was unknown to boltzmann and it was just birthing when gibbs book was published .",
    "it was left to von neumann to extend eq .   in order to encompass quantum systems .",
    "he showed that the entropy for a quantum system should be expressed by using the density matrix operator  @xmath15 , namely @xmath16 }   \\;\\;\\;(\\mathrm{tr}\\widehat{\\rho}=1 )     \\ , , \\label{eq : entropia_von_neumann}\\ ] ] sometimes referred to as the boltzmann - gibbs - von neumann entropy ( or just von neumann entropy ) .",
    "notice indeed that the above equation recovers eq .",
    "( [ sbg ] ) when @xmath15 is diagonal .",
    "the optimization of the entropy with appropriate constraints provides the thermal equilibrium distribution , namely the celebrated bg exponential distribution , whose consequences are consistent with classical thermodynamics . in",
    "what follows we shall , however , see that entropic functionals different from the bg one must be used in order to satisfy thermodynamics for complex systems which strongly violate the probabilistic independence ( or quasi - independence ) hypothesis on which the bg entropy is generically based .",
    "this is typically the case whenever there is breakdown of ergodicity .",
    "several dozens of non - bg entropic functionals have been studied along quite a few decades .",
    "we focus here on the following one ( introduced in @xcite with the aim to generalize the bg statistical mechanics ) : @xmath17 where @xmath18 , and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "we straightforwardly verify that @xmath21 .",
    "the inverse of the @xmath0-logarithmic function @xmath22 is the @xmath0-exponential function @xmath23^\\frac{1}{1-q}$ ] , if @xmath24 , and zero otherwise ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "an entropic functional @xmath26 is said _ additive _ if it satisfies@xcite , for any two _ probabilistically independent _ systems @xmath27 and @xmath28 , that @xmath29 ; otherwise it is said _",
    "nonadditive_. we easily verify that @xmath30 therefore @xmath11 is additive , and @xmath31 ( with @xmath4 ) is nonadditive .",
    "the generalization of the bg thermostatistical theory is currently referred to as nonextensive statistical mechanics @xcite ( see @xcite for a regularly updated bibliography .",
    "the entropy @xmath31 satisfies several interesting properties ; among them , the uniqueness theorems proved by santos@xcite and by abe@xcite , as well as the connection @xcite with the einstein likelihood factorization principle deserve a special mention .",
    "the natural , artificial and social complex systems to which @xmath31 and its associated statistical mechanics have been applied are very diverse .",
    "they include long - range interacting many - body hamiltonian systems ( see @xcite for an overview ) of various types and symmetries ( let us incidentally mention that long - range versions of the interesting types focused on in @xcite have not yet been handled ) , as well as non - hamiltonian ones @xcite , low - dimensional dynamical systems @xcite , cold atoms @xcite , plasmas @xcite , trapped atoms @xcite , spin - glasses@xcite , granular matter @xcite , high - energy particle collisions @xcite , black holes and cosmology @xcite , chemistry @xcite , economics @xcite , earthquakes @xcite , biology @xcite , solar wind @xcite , anomalous diffusion and central limit theorems@xcite , quantum entangled and nonentangled systems @xcite , quantum chaos @xcite , astronomical systems @xcite , signal and image processing @xcite , self - organized criticality @xcite , mathematical structures @xcite , scale - free networks @xcite , among others .",
    "the optimization of @xmath11 under appropriate constraints yields _ exponential _ forms for the probabilities , as well as for other relevant thermostatistical quantities ( relaxation behaviors and sensitivity to the initial conditions are typical dynamical ones ) .",
    "it happens , however , that virtually all those natural , artificial and social systems usually considered as complex violate this behavior .",
    "indeed they asymptotically present slower behaviors such as ( very frequently ) power - laws , and ( occasionally ) stretched exponentials , to only mention the most typical ones .",
    "in fact , no nonzero distribution of a real positive unbounded random continuous variable can exist with a single power law since it is non normalizable ; indeed , @xmath32 diverges for _ any _ real value of @xmath33 .",
    "the lvy , @xmath0-exponential , @xmath0-gaussian , @xmath34-stable distributions @xcite are all different .",
    "they constitute but a few among the infinitely many distributions which asymptotically behave as a power law .",
    "they exhibit nevertheless important differences for finite values of the random variable .",
    "it is therefore a severe misuse to plainly refer , as regretfully done very frequently in the literature , to ",
    "lvy distribution \" every time that in a log - log plot a straight line is observed along some decades . as said ,",
    "lvy distributions are only one case among infinitely many which asymptotically behave as power - laws ( for other similar misnames , see @xcite ) . ] .",
    "let introduce now the @xmath0-triplet along the lines of @xcite .",
    "we consider the following ordinary differential equation @xmath35 whose solution is given by @xmath36 we may think of it in at least three different physical manners , related respectively to the sensitivity @xmath37 to the initial conditions , to the relaxation in phase space ( of say the bg entropy towards its value at thermal equilibrium ) , and , if the system is hamiltonian , to the distribution of energies ( or analogous quantities such as the distribution of velocities ) at thermal equilibrium . in the first interpretation",
    "we refer to the exponential divergence with time of two trajectories in phase space with slightly different initial conditions . in the second interpretation ,",
    "we focus some relaxing relevant quantity @xmath38 where @xmath39 is some dynamical observable essentially related to the evolution of the system in phase space ( e.g. , the time evolution of entropy while the system approaches equilibrium ) .",
    "we typically expect @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the relaxation time ( depending on the physical property that we are focusing on , it might be @xmath42 or not , where @xmath43 is the maximal lyapunov exponent )",
    ". finally , in the third interpretation , we have @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the bg partition function .",
    "the various interpretations are summarized in table [ table5.1 ] .",
    ".three possible physical interpretations of eq .",
    "( [ 5.14 ] ) within @xmath46 statistical mechanics . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     a plethora of @xmath0-triplets have been found in solar plasma @xcite , the ozone layer @xcite , logistic map ( see @xcite ) , el nio / southern oscillation @xcite , geological faults @xcite , finance@xcite , dna sequence @xcite , and elsewhere @xcite .",
    "let us consider the following transformation : @xmath47 or , equivalently , @xmath48 we straightforwardly verify that @xmath49 ( _ additive duality _ ) and @xmath50 ( _ multiplicative duality _ ) @xcite . also , we generically verify _ selfduality",

    "[ selfduality ] .",
    "the duality is in fact the most general ratio of linear functions of @xmath0 which satisfies these two important properties ( selfduality and bg fixed point ) .",
    "it transforms biunivocally the interval @xmath53 into the interval @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "moreover , for @xmath55 and @xmath56 we recover respectively @xmath57 @xcite and @xmath58 @xcite .     as given by eq .",

( [ transform1 ] ) and ( [ transform2 ] ) . the particular choice @xmath91 yields the algebra introduced in @xcite . also , the particular choice @xmath107 within the transformation ( [ transform3 ] ) recovers the transformation @xmath108 , which plays a crucial role in the @xmath0-generalized central limit theorem @xcite .",
    "more generally , the relation @xmath109 recovers the @xmath110 case of eq .",
    "( 32 ) of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the data observed in @xcite for the solar wind are consistent with the @xmath0-triplet @xcite @xmath111 .    if we identify , in eq .",
    "( [ transform3 ] ) , @xmath112 we can verify that , for @xmath113 , the data are consistently recovered .",
    "moreover , if we use once again eq .",
    "( [ transform3 ] ) and @xmath113 , but identifying now @xmath114 , once again the data are consistently recovered .",
    "the particular case @xmath91 was first proposed in @xcite . in other words , it is possible to consider this @xmath0-triplet as having only one independent value , say @xmath115 ; from this value we can calculate @xmath116 by using eq .",
    "( [ transform3 ] ) ; and from @xmath116 we can calculate @xmath117 by using once again eq .",
    "( [ transform3 ] ) .",
    "this discussion can be summarized as follows : @xmath118 it is occasionally convenient to use the @xmath119-triplet defined as @xmath120 .",
    "let us mention that an amazing set of relations was found among these by @xcite , namely @xmath121 the emergence of the three pythagorean means in this specific @xmath0-triplet remains still today enigmatic .",
    "let us now focus on a different system , namely the well known logistic map at its edge of chaos ( also referred to as the feigenbaum point ) .",
    "the numerical data for this map yield the @xmath0-triplet @xmath122 @xcite .",
    "an heuristic relation has been found @xcite between these three values , namely ( using @xmath123 ) @xmath124 indeed , this relation straightforwardly implies @xmath125 through this relation we obtain @xmath126 which is perfectly compatible with @xmath127 . in the generalized algebra that we have developed here above",
    "we have three free parameters @xmath128 in addition to the integer numbers @xmath87 .",
    "it is therefore trivial to make analytical identifications with @xmath129 such that eq .",
    "( [ baella2 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "the real challenge , however , is to find a general theoretical frame within which such identifications ( and , through the freedom associated with @xmath87 , infinitely many more , related to physical quantities ) become established on a clear basis , and not only through conjectural possibilities .",
    "such a frame of systematic identifications remains up to now elusive and certainly constitutes a most interesting open question . along this line ,",
    "a connection that might reveal promising is that , if we assume that @xmath0 is a complex number ( see , for instance , @xcite ) , then eq . ( [ qdualitynew ] ) corresponds to nonsingular [ with @xmath130 moebius transformations , which form the moebius group , defining an automorphism of the riemann sphere .",
