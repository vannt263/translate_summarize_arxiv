    "it has been suggested that damped lyman @xmath1 absorption systems ( dlaas )  massive clouds of gas which produce saturated lyman @xmath1 absorption features in the spectra of background quasars  are the high - redshift progenitors of current disk galaxies ( wolfe 1993 ) .",
    "the properties of dlaas are therefore interesting in terms of the formation process of galaxies such as our own ( lanzetta et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "there is some evidence that the number or size of dlaas evolves over the redshift range @xmath6 ( white , kinney & becker 1993 ) , which implies the conversion of gas into stars at @xmath7 ; indeed , some dlaas at @xmath8 have metallicities of 1020 per cent solar ( pettini et al .",
    "1994 ) , and some contain sufficient dust to slightly redden their background quasars ( pei et al .",
    "although their interstellar medium has clearly been enriched , direct evidence of star formation has yet to be demonstrated ( hu et al .",
    "1993 ) .    if @xmath7 dlaas are protogalactic systems then they should have reservoirs of low - metallicity gas and high star - formation rates . in support of this ,",
    "frayer et al .  (",
    "1994 ) reported co(10 ) and ( more tentatively ) co(32 ) emission from a @xmath0 dlaas towards the quasar pc1643@xmath94631a ( schneider , schmidt & gunn 1991 ) ; their data were consistent with the gas being clumped , with dimensions similar to those of a galactic disk and a mass of around 10@xmath10m@xmath11 ( we assume @xmath12 , @xmath13kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2 throughout this paper ) .",
    "the co luminosity was estimated to be several orders of magnitude greater than that of the milky way .",
    "braine et al .  (",
    "1996 ) attempted to confirm the frayer et al .",
    "result using the iram interferometer , but concluded that the earlier co detections were spurious .",
    "they pointed out that an interferometer is less prone to distorted baselines than the conventional single - dish approach , and noted that its ideal application is the detection of broad , weak lines from sources smaller than the primary beam ( in this case , @xmath14 at 3 mm ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning , however , that weak sources spread over @xmath15 ( @xmath16kpc ) would be heavily resolved by the iram interferometer and hence very difficult to detect .",
    "the nrao 140-ft and 12-m dishes used by frayer et al .",
    "have hpbws of @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( @xmath19kpc ) , so the co detections of frayer et al .  can be understood ( in the context of the braine et al.data ) only if the molecular gas proves to be extended on scales an order of magnitude larger than the milky way .",
    "( co has also been reported towards pks0528@xmath20250 in a dlaas at @xmath21  brown & vanden bout 1992  and , again , the validity of the detection was disputed  wiklind & combes 1994 ) .    in a galactic environment",
    ", skins of atomic gas are thought to cover each clump of molecular gas , with the thickness of the skin determined by the abundance of dust , which provides protection from the global uv field for the co molecules within . in the atomic skin ,",
    "incident uv photons left over from dissociating and ionizing are absorbed by dust grains , which cool via far - ir continuum emission ; photoelectrons , ejected as a consequence of uv absorption by the grains , heat the atomic and molecular hydrogen .",
    "the c@xmath22 ions are then collisionally excited and emit the [ cii ] ( @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 ) fine - structure line ( hollenbach , takahashi & tielens 1991 ; mochizuki et al .",
    "the [ cii ] emission is an important cooling process in galaxies , accounting for up to 1 per cent of the far - ir luminosity ( stacey et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "our objective here was to search for [ cii ]  an unmistakable signature of star - formation activity  in a dlaas with a large column density of neutral hydrogen , @xmath26@xmath27 ( white et al .",
    "1993 ) , and where co had apparently been detected , and to thereby independently confirm that star formation is ongoing in that system and that enriched gas is present . demonstrating the potential of [ cii ] as a probe of metallicity , of dlaas star - formation history , and of the evolution of galaxies at these redshifts , would represent a major advance in our studies of the early universe .",
    "for nearby galaxies , the rest frequency of the [ cii ] transition ( 1.900537thz ) means that the line is inaccessible from the ground and , to date , all detections in the near universe have been made by the balloon - borne experiments ( mochizuchi et al .",
    "1994 ) , the kuiper airbourne observatory ( stacey et al .  1991 ) or the cosmic background explorer ( bennett et al .",
    "however , at high redshifts the [ cii ] line is shifted into windows observable from mauna kea with the 15-m jcmt ; specifically , for @xmath28 the line appears in the b window , and for @xmath29 it appears in the c window . to date , there have been no detections of highly redshifted [ cii ] ( e.g.  isaak et al .  1994 ) .",
    "the data reported here were obtained during excellent observing conditions in 1994 dec and 1995 jan , mostly as part of an experiment in flexibly scheduled service observing at the jcmt .",
    "we used the single - channel sis receiver , c2 , with a broad - band digital autocorrelation spectrometer ( das ) as the backend . the beam ( 11@xmath30 fwhm , or around 20kpc at @xmath0 )",
    "was nutated by 60@xmath30 in azimuth , at a rate of 1hz , with the telescope position - switching by the same distance every 30s to alternate the signal and reference beams .",
    "the maximum pointing offset during the observations was less than 4@xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 ranged from 1050 to 2300k , and the sky transparency was excellent .",
    "a total of 105min was spent on source , with a 175 per cent overhead for sky subtraction , position switching , calibration and pointing checks .",
    ".log of observations towards pc1643 + 4631a . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     the maximum bandwidth of the das ( 920mhz , or 600kms@xmath2  at 459.399807ghz ) is barely sufficient when searching for high - frequency lines , particularly when the target line is broad as was expected to be the case here .",
    "for this reason , four slightly overlapping spectra were obtained ( with band centres at 458.74362 , 459.39987 , 460.05612 and 460.71237ghz  see table  1 ) , giving a full velocity coverage of 1890kms@xmath2 .",
    "these were reduced , using specx v6.7 ( padman 1993 ) , baseline - subtracted ( zero order baselines ) and binned to give a velocity resolution of 40kms@xmath2 .",
    "the overlap regions were averaged .",
    "our conversion from atmosphere - corrected antenna temperatures , @xmath32 , to the @xmath33 scale assumes a forward spillover efficiency , @xmath34 , of 70 per cent , and is accurate to @xmath35 per cent .",
    "the conversion factor between the @xmath33 scale and flux density is @xmath36jy , which assumes an aperture efficiency of 42 per cent .",
    "the beam efficiency at 460ghz , measured on mars , was @xmath37 per cent , so @xmath38 , with an overall uncertainty of around 20 per cent .",
    "in fig .  1 we present our jcmt spectrum , together with the co data from frayer et al .  (",
    "the overall rms is @xmath39mk , or @xmath40mk if we limit ourselves to the central portion of the spectrum .",
    "the resulting upper limit on the integrated line intensity , calculated using the formulae derived by seaquist , ivison & hall ( 1995 ) , assuming a rectangular profile with fwhm 680kms@xmath2  ( similar that of the co(10 ) line reported by frayer et al .",
    "1994 ) , is @xmath3kkms@xmath2 .",
    "frayer et al.(1994 ) give @xmath41(co(10 ) ) = @xmath42kkms@xmath2 , or @xmath43jykms@xmath2 , or @xmath44wm@xmath45 , hence the measured [ cii]/co(10 ) intensity ratio is @xmath4 .",
    "braine et al .  (",
    "1996 ) reported an rms of 1.25mjy in channels of width 224kms@xmath2  for their observations of co(32 ) .",
    "this translates into a limit on the integrated line intensity of @xmath46jykms@xmath2  or @xmath47wm@xmath45 ( assuming a rectangular profile with fwhm 800kms@xmath2 , as reported by frayer et al .",
    "1994 )  a factor of 7.1 lower than the integrated co(32 ) line intensity ( @xmath48jykms@xmath2 ) reported by frayer et al .",
    "( 1994 ) . assuming that the co(10 ) has been similarly overestimated , this yields a [ cii]/co(10 ) intensity ratio of @xmath49 .",
    "( 80,142 ) ( 0,0 )    ( 80,105 ) ( 0,0 )    ( 0,0 )    fig .",
    "2 shows a graphic demonstration of the dangers of coadding overlapping spectra to improve velocity coverage . in this case , baselines were not subtracted from the individual segments .",
    "the effect of combining the poor baselines is to generate a very convincing emission feature ( still more so if we subtract a linear baseline at this stage  see the lower panel of fig .  2 ) .",
    "the apparent emission line is centred at @xmath50kms@xmath2  for @xmath0 and has a full width similar to that of the controversial co lines , though more gaussian in profile .",
    "the integrated intensity of the apparent line is @xmath51kkms@xmath2on the @xmath41 scale , which would have indicated a [ cii]/co(10 ) intensity ratio of 63000 .",
    "this would have led us to completely the wrong conclusion since this value is consistent with those of low - metallicity systems ( see the discussion that follows ) . moreover ,",
    "this would have been regarded as strong support for the validity of the co detections and as indicative of rapid ongoing star formation in the dlaas towards pc1643 + 4631a .",
    "offsets such as those seen in the upper panel of fig .",
    "2 are usually the result of incomplete sky subtraction , or poor instrumental stability .",
    "we suspect the former in this case , even though the spectra were obtained during excellent and seemingly quite stable conditions .",
    "it is possible that more frequent nodding between the signal and reference beams would have reduced the offsets , but such anomalies are a fact of life in the submillimetre regime and we can be grateful to some extent that the baselines produced rxc2 and das are such good approximations of zeroth order .",
    "there are no fool - proof methods of achieving perfect sky subtraction and if there is a lesson to be learned , it is that high - bandwidth receivers and spectrometers are extremely desirable in this field .",
    "in nearby starbursts , the photodissociated gas represents a substantial fraction ( 40 per cent ) of the total gas mass in the nuclei , and the line - intensity ratio of [ cii ] to co(10 ) is 4100 , with a very small scatter ( stacey et al .",
    "1991 ) . in the galactic plane ,",
    "the ratio is around 1300 ( nakagawa et al .",
    "1993 ) , whilst in low - metallicity regions such as 30  dor , or the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) in general , the ratio is high ( 77000 and 23000 for 30  dor and the lmc , respectively ) because there are few dust grains to shield the molecular gas .",
    "the uv therefore penetrates deep inside each clump , dissociating co and creating a thick skin of c@xmath22 ions ( mochizuki et al .",
    "note that although the metallicity is thought to have the dominant influence on the [ cii]/co(10 ) line intensity ratio , the global uv field strength is also expected to have some effect .",
    "given that dlaas at @xmath52 are expected to be low - metallicity systems , perhaps similar in many respects to the lmc , the data we have presented ( in particular the low limit on the [ cii]/co(10 ) intensity ratio , based on the claimed co(10 ) detection ) support the view that the co detections of frayer et al .",
    "( 1994 ) were spurious .",
    "there is , however , one proviso concerning the beams used to sample the emission region : the area of our beam ( 11@xmath30 fwhm ) was @xmath53 times smaller than those used by frayer et al . , and if the emission region proves to be an order of magnitude larger than the milky way then we would not only have missed the majority of the emitting gas , but we may well have been chopping onto some of it .",
    "we have searched for redshifted [ cii ] towards a @xmath0 damped ly@xmath1 absorption system that has a large neutral hydrogen column density and which was controversially reported to be a source of co emission , indicative of rapid star - formation .",
    "we find no sign of [ cii ] emission and have placed an upper limit of @xmath54kkms@xmath2  on the integrated line intensity .",
    "this places a useful constraint on the [ cii]/co(10 ) line - intensity ratio ( @xmath4 , based on the line intensity reported by frayer et al .",
    "1994 ) which is consistent with ratios measured in normal - metallicity systems in the present - day universe , but is significantly lower than the ratio found in systems with low metallicities such as we might expect to find in high - redshift damped lyman @xmath1 absorption systems .",
    "we interpret this as evidence against the reality of the co line detections towards this system , as long as the system is not significantly larger than present - day disk galaxies such as the milky way ( which would compromise our measured ratios on the basis of disparate beam sizes ) .",
    "we have also demonstated the dangers inherent in knitting together overlapping bands to increase velocity coverage .",
    "clearly , wide - band receivers and backends are urgently required if we are to generate a trustworthy database of co , [ cii ] , etc .",
