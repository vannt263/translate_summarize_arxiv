    "theory of quantum communication was initiated more than thirty years ago , in order to consider quantum nature of signal carrier in optical frequency domain . in this region , one faces quite different features from rf band communication , due to quantum noise of signal carrier itself .",
    "this theory was then developed in 1970 s revealing new aspects of information transmission and signal detection .",
    "it now attracts much attention since new fields such as quantum computation and cryptography emerged .",
    "being assisted by ideas and methods in these fields , significant progress was made in a basic and old issue on channel capacity .",
    "in particular , the theorem was established that the attainable maximum rate of asymptotically error free transmission for sending classical information by using a given source of quantum states ( letter states ) is precisely the holevo bound @xcite ( let us call it the quantum channel coding ( qcc ) theorem ) @xcite .",
    "this rate is the asymptotic rate at infinite block length , @xmath1 , and is especially called _ classical capacity _ of quantum channel .",
    "capacity _ of quantum channel is now used in various contexts of quantum information theory , including not only transmission of fixed classical alphabet but also sending intact quantum states . in this paper , we confine ourselves to transmission of classical information by use of a given letter - state ensemble , and hereafter the term _",
    "capacity _ is understood as _ classical capacity _ for this case .",
    "the qcc theorem guarantees existence of codes that have the above asymptotic property , but does not tell directly how to construct such codes from given letter states . for practical applications , simple and systematic coding - decoding methods at finite block length is required .",
    "such methods will immediately be applied to , for example , advanced schemes of satellite communication and ultra - fast optical fiber communication . in these cases ,",
    "signal power at receiving end might be very weak due to long distance transmission or limited power supply so that a main source to cause error will be nonorthogonality among letter states , which is just the situation covered by the above theorem .    the purpose of this paper is to give some insights into practical aspects of quantum channel coding . in quantum channel coding , block sequences",
    "are made as direct product states of the letter states , some of them are selected and transmitted as _ codeword states _ , and they are then detected quantum mechanically . a quantum channel made of the codeword states of length @xmath0 is called a @xmath0-product channel .",
    "there are two essential ingredients in using this @xmath0-product channel ; one is the suitable selection of codeword states from all the possible sequences made of the letter states , and the other is a _ collective decoding _ that detects each codeword state as a single state - vector rather than decoding the individual letter states separately .",
    "especially , the latter fully utilizes superposition states of the codeword states , and brings an inseparable structure among the letter states , which is often called _",
    "entanglement_. this remarkable feature can not be found in classical channel coding . as a consequence , the @xmath0-product channel can have a _ memory effect _ in the sense that the channel matrix can not be factorized into the channel matrices corresponding to each letter , i.e. , @xmath2 .",
    "this is even so if neither a source system emitting letter states nor a physical process of transmission has memory effect .",
    "this effect can be used to increase a reliability of information transmission . in fact , the codeword states are selected suitably , this effect makes it possible that more classical information can be sent through the @xmath0-product channel than @xmath0-times the amount that can be sent through a single use of the initial channel made merely of the letter states without any coding scheme .",
    "this so - called superadditivity in capacity is a generic nature of a quantum channel , and is indeed information theoretic quantum gain @xcite .",
    "so the first step toward finding the ultimate channel coding for the holevo bound might be to construct codes that attain this quantum gain .    in this paper , quantum channels that shows the superadditivity in capacity",
    "is described .",
    "we first consider optimization of decoding .",
    "the collective decoding used in the proof of the qcc theorem was the so - called _ square - root measurement _ @xcite .",
    "this allows one to derive an explicit decoding observable systematically from given codeword states .",
    "in addition , this has been known to be almost optimum when the quantum states to be distinguished are equally likely and almost orthogonal @xcite , which is the case for the typical sequences obtained at very long block length .",
    "therefore , it played a sufficient role to evaluate the upper bound of the decoding error .",
    "but this measurement is actually more than that . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , it will be pointed out that the square - root measurement becomes precisely optimum in terms of the average error probability in certain cases of pure and linearly independent quantum states that are even neither equiprobable nor almost orthogonal .",
    "the optimality of decoding strategy should be pursued in order to achieve performance as high as possible , especially in a practical channel coding of finite block length .",
    "when the square - root measurement is not optimum , there is a method to construct the optimum one by modifying it . for a practical purpose",
    ", we present a basic scheme of the optimum collective decoding of codeword states in the case of pure - state channel in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] . as for physical realizations of this scheme , the readers are referred to the subsequent paper .    in order to quantify the superadditivity in capacity ,",
    "the attainable maximum mutual information without any coding must be known .",
    "this quantity is usually denoted as @xmath3 .",
    "the optimum solutions of the prior probabilities and the decoding observable that maximize the mutual information have been known only in a few cases @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "the most basic case of binary and pure letter states is considered . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , we define a _ threshold point _ where all the sequences are used as the codeword states and the accessible information ( the maximum mutual information attained by optimizing the decoding observable with prior probabilities fixed ) at block length @xmath0 is exactly @xmath4 . at this point , the optimum decoding is not like a collective fashion but rather reduces to the separate measurement which detects each letter state individually , that is , there is no room for generating entanglement correlation among letter states .",
    "this threshold point will be a useful guide for quantitative discussions . sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "to begin with , we shall describe the conditions for optimality in a general decision problem of @xmath5-ary quantum states .",
    "an ensemble of quantum states @xmath6 is given with respective prior probabilities @xmath7 .",
    "decision process of these signal states @xmath6 can be described by a probability operator measure ( pom ) @xmath8 satisfying the resolution of the identity @xmath9 .",
    "the pom effecting the decision needs only @xmath5 components @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 which are usually called _ detection operators_. what we are seeking here are the optimum detection operators minimizing the average error probability . defining the risk operators @xmath14 and the lagrange operator @xmath15 , the optimum conditions are written as @xcite ,    * @xmath16 * @xmath17    the minimum average error probability is given by @xmath18    when the signal states are pure ( @xmath19 ) and linearly independent , the optimum detection operators can be given as the projection - valued measure ( pvm ) with rank 1 as @xmath20 .",

    "otherwise , one has to rely on numerical simulations like the bayes - cost - reduction algorithm @xcite .",
    "most tedious part in such a method is to check the second condition ii@xmath28 ) .",

    "now let us consider when the square - root measurement becomes optimum .",

    "because of the linearly independence of @xmath23 , @xmath56 is nonsingular and @xmath57 exists . then @xmath58 @xmath53    thus ,",
    "for linearly independent states , the set @xmath38 is always a complete orthogonal set in @xmath22 .",
    "so it can be connected via a unitary operator @xmath59 in @xmath22 with the optimum measurement states @xmath21 as @xmath60 .",
    "such an operator can be constructed , for example , as a series of 2-dim rotations by applying the bayes - cost - reduction algorithm @xcite .",
    "this algorithm consists of steps of solving a binary decision problem of a chosen pair of signal states @xmath61 on the plane spanned by the corresponding pair of basis vectors @xmath62 . at every step ,",
    "two basis vectors are revised , and the average error would decrease or , at worst , remain the same .",
    "these 2-dim rotations are continued till reaching the optimum point where the previous conditions i@xmath28 ) and ii@xmath28 ) are satisfied .",
    "the resulting series of their products is just the required unitary operator @xmath63 .",
    "deriving the analytic expression of the optimum measurement basis vectors @xmath21 is a difficult job , but these basis vectors can be constructed somehow as explained in the previous section , and at the same time the channel matrix can be obtained .",
    "thus only for evaluating performance , it is sufficient to derive these @xmath21 . from a practice point of view , however , the basis vectors @xmath21 hardly imply a corresponding physical process .",

    ", we present a useful scheme for realizing the optimum collective decoding . in the case that the letter states are binary",

    "the quantum gain @xmath243 reveals itself within such regions .",
    "the same tendency could be seen in other codes .",

    "suppose that @xmath5-ary codewords are used with equal prior probabilities .",
    "then the square - root measurement is again the optimum collective decoding for them .",

    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] , respectively .",
    "the @xmath251\\right]$ ] simplex code has higher distinguishability of the codewords than the @xmath252\\right]$ ] code so that the minimum average error is much smaller , while its mutual information is not necessarily larger than the latter .",
    "the former overcomes the latter only in the region @xmath253 . around this region ,",
    "the minimum average error probability is , again , larger than the one in the initial channel @xmath254 .",
    "this tendency may be understood as a result from the facts that in order to produce the quantum gain a quantum interference among the codeword states must occur to reduce certain components of the channel matrix , and that such a quantum interference occurs more drastically when the nonorthogonality of the codeword states is larger , hence in larger side of @xmath230 .",
    "on the other hand , the nonorthogonality causes the certain amount of decoding error as well .",
    "this decreases the amount of transmittable information , while the quantum gain may appear if the quantum interference reduces certain components of the channel matrix in a proper manner .",
    "thus at shorter block length , the quantum gain as the difference @xmath255 is likely to appear in larger side of @xmath230 being accompanied by a certain amount of decoding error .",
    "a rough guide in order to construct a channel attaining the quantum gain for a given @xmath230 , is as follows ; the ratio of the number of the message bits @xmath256 to the block length @xmath0 should be taken larger than @xmath160 at this @xmath230 first , and then codeword states should be selected being with distance as equally apart as possible . as @xmath230 becomes closer to the unity , it becomes more effective in obtaining the quantum gain to take the ratio @xmath257 small and to select the codeword states being distant .",
    "as an example , the simplex code @xmath258 $ ] is compared with the code @xmath259 $ ] in the region @xmath260 in fig .",
    "around at @xmath261 , the @xmath258 $ ] code ( solid line ) is more efficient in terms of the mutual information than the @xmath259 $ ] code ( dotted line ) . for constructing codes such that the decoding error can be as small as possible and the rate can reach the holevo bound",
    ", a larger block length at which the typical subspace can be well defined is necessary .",
    "practical methods for obtaining larger quantum gain must be studied in great detail along this direction .",
    "the initial channel considered in this paper is the binary symmetric pure - state channel which is the simplest quantum channel .",
    "when the binary letter states are orthogonal , the channel is error free , and there is no quantum regime , that is , @xmath0-th order capacity obviously satisfies the strict additivity @xmath262 .",
    "when they are nonorthogonal , i.e. @xmath263 , the strict _ superadditivity _ @xmath264 , in turn , reveals itself .",
    "what we have shown in this paper is a demonstration of @xmath265 that ensures the strict _",
    "superadditivity_.    the first part of this paper was devoted to the optimum collective decoding of the codeword states at the minimum average error probability .",
    "the scheme we proposed consists of the unitary transformation and the separate measurement .",
    "the unitary transformation generates appropriate superposition states among the codeword states such that the minimum average error is attained at the separate measurement .",
    "these output states are not separable into the letter states any more .",
    "minimization of decoding error is just a manifestation of the optimum use of quantum interference associated with this kind of superposition states .",
    "the required unitary transformation is essentially a conditional dynamics in a higher dimensional hilbert space , and is realized by a quantum circuit which is capable of manipulating each letter state in a conditional manner depending on the other letter states .",
    "thus our scheme suggests a state - of - the - art quantum decoder structure .",
    "quantum channels involving the above collective decoding has a _ memory effect _ ,",
    "i.e. @xmath2 .",
    "this inseparability of quantum channel is a direct origin of the quantum gain @xmath265 .",
    "only when codeword states are selected suitably , this inseparability leads to the quantum gain .",
    "we gave a heuristic approach to attain this gain for a given letter - state ensemble .",
    "our examples are always accompanied by a larger amount of decoding error than the minimum average error in the initial channel .",
    "as mention in the previous section , this dilemma is because both decoding error and the quantum gain are originated from the nonorthogonality of the letter states .",
    "although some basic aspects for realizing the quantum gain were clarified by this paper , practical codes that transmit classical alphabet faithfully at the maximum rate are still completely unknown . even in classical information theory , realization of such codes that achieve asymptotically error free transmission at the rate @xmath3",
    "is very difficult .",
    "it might be an interesting problem to consider an application of some conventional error correcting codes to the @xmath0-product quantum channels described in this paper .",
    "this will lead to realization of asymptotically error free transmission at the rate @xmath266 ( @xmath267 ) . for the ultimate quantum channel coding , typicality of the hilbert space spanned by the codeword states and sophisticated quantum error - correction",
