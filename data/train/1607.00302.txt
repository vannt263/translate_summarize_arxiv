    "our experiment realizes an all - optical , single - photon quantum cheshire cat . as predicted by both the weak - value and wave - function formalisms , whether the observed photon counts are sensitive to weak measurements of photon presence and circular polarization depends on the particular arm of the interferometer in which each measurement is carried out .",
    "we find that , on average and for the pre- and postselected states used in the experiment , photons passing through one of the arms are not appreciably affected by weak measurements of presence , while photons in the other arm are not appreciably affected by weak measurements of polarization .",
    "we explicitly confirm this result also when the two measurements are carried out simultaneously .",
    "this behavior is succinctly represented by the weak values for these two kinds of weak measurements : the theoretical prediction for the weak value in one of the arms is zero while it has unit magnitude in the other arm .",
    "we measured these weak values from the change in the observed photon counts when the weak measurements are introduced and found good agreement with the theoretical values .",
    "dominant sources of error in our experiment are imperfections in the preparation , manipulation , and postselection of the polarization states .",
    "the extent to which one considers a quantum cheshire cat to establish a paradoxical situation depends largely on how one interprets the physical meaning of weak values , and several such interpretations have been suggested @xcite .",
    "our experiment emphasizes that weak values are ensemble averages @xcite , because the weak values are measured from changes in the detected intensities and fringe visibilities , requiring accumulation of many photon events . as has been shown here and elsewhere @xcite , the observed measurement statistics for a quantum cheshire cat",
    "can also be understood as a consequence of ordinary quantum interference , without recourse to weak values .",
    "quantum cheshire cats highlight peculiar features of weak values , just as the first work on weak values did @xcite .",
    "our experiment provides a powerful and physically transparent implementation that illuminates these features and aids in the analysis and interpretation of the quantum cheshire cat .",
    "the authors are indebted to m.  beck for helpful conversations and crucial equipment advice .",
