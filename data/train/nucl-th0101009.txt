    "in a recent manuscript @xcite we developed a three - dimensional approach in momentum space for nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) scattering . the motivation is that for higher energies too many partial waves contribute and a direct solution seems more natural and economic . as relevant variables momentum vectors appear , specifically their magnitudes and the angles between them .",
    "the formulation in @xcite is based on a helicity representation with respect to the total spin of the two nucleon system .",
    "this representation is different from the often used helicity basis referring to the individual nucleons @xcite .",
    "a further important advantage of a three dimensional approach is that a sometimes tedious partial wave expansion of a complex nn force is no longer needed .",
    "instead one introduces a helicity representation of the nn force , which is perfectly adapted to the set of six operators completely describing the most general nn force compatible with general invariance principles .",
    "thus , for any nn force given in operator form this scheme is applicable .    the helicity representation developed for nn scattering",
    "can also be applied to the bound nn system .",
    "it may appear unnecessary to extend this particular formulation to study the nonrelativistic deuteron , which only contains @xmath0 and @xmath1 waves .",
    "however , the standard practice requires a partial wave representation of the nn force , which we avoid .",
    "it is straightforward to extend the helicity formulation developed for scattering to investigate the deuteron , calculate its binding energy , and wave function properties .",
    "this is the purpose of the present investigation .",
    "in addition we study the various wave function properties in momentum space in a three dimensional fashion .",
    "our numerical example is based on the bonn - b potential @xcite .",
    "a graphical study of similar character has been carried out in configuration space @xcite based on the av18 nuclear force @xcite .",
    "in addition we derive and display probability densities of various spin configurations for an overall polarized deuteron .",
    "these densities are based on analytical expressions , which we think are new .    in section ii we introduce the expansion of the deuteron state into helicity basis states as defined in @xcite .",
    "then we project the deuteron eigenvalue equation on these states . since the deuteron has spin 1 there are three possible values for the helicity projections , namely @xmath2 .",
    "symmetry properties allow to consider only @xmath3 .",
    "thus we obtain a set of two coupled equations in two variables , the magnitude @xmath4 of the relative momentum vector and the angle between @xmath5 and the arbitrarily chosen z - axis .",
    "this two dimensional form of the deuteron wave function is then connected to the standard partial wave representation .",
    "we demonstrate that this set of two coupled two dimensional equations can be readily solved and display various wave function properties .    in section iii",
    "we derive the deuteron wave function in ` operator form ' . in a configuration space representation",
    "such a form has been given before @xcite .",
    "for our purpose an ` operator form ' is an ideal starting point , since the spin degrees of freedom appear explicitly as spin operators , and thus fit perfectly into our helicity formulation .",
    "the projection of the wave function on the helicity basis leads to deuteron wave function components with an analytical angular behavior , which is different from the familiar one .",
    "the ` radial ' part of the wave function satisfies a set of two coupled ( @xmath3 ) , one dimensional eigenvalue equations in @xmath6 .",
    "based on this more analytical insight the connection to the standard @xmath0 and @xmath1 waves forms started in section ii can be finalized .",
    "there are various possibilities that the two nucleons in the deuteron have a specific orientation of their spins for an overall polarized deuteron .",
    "for instance , both nucleons can have their spins up , or one nucleon can have its spin up and the other down . in section",
    "iv we derive analytic expressions of the corresponding probabilities and display the results .",
    "this may have applications for electron scattering on the deuteron .",
    "finally we summarize in section v.",
    "let @xmath7 represent the deuteron state . here",
    "@xmath8 is the projection of the total angular momentum along a chosen axis , e.g. the z - axis .",
    "the deuteron state will now be represented in the helicity basis @xmath9 defined in @xcite . here",
    "@xmath10 stands for the relative momentum of the two nucleons , @xmath0 for the total spin , @xmath11 for its projection along @xmath12 , and @xmath13 for the total isospin .",
    "the index @xmath14 denotes the parity of the state , and @xmath15 indicates the state being antisymmetric .",
    "this results in @xmath16 here we took into account that for the deuteron @xmath17 , @xmath18 and the parity is even .",
    "the general form of the helicity eigenstate is given by @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the parity eigenvalue .",
    "using @xmath21 one verifies the following properties : @xmath22 with the above relations one obtains for the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq2.1 ] ) @xmath23 hence , eq .  ( [ eq2.1 ] ) simplifies to @xmath24 where we defined @xmath25    the azimuthal dependency of the amplitude defined in eq .",

    "the state @xmath26 is obtained by rotating the state @xmath27 from the z - axis into the direction of @xmath28 as @xmath29 where @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the operator of total angular momentum .",
    "it follows that @xmath32 thus , we can redefine @xmath33 such that the azimuthal dependency is factored out @xmath34 this leads to the final expression of the deuteron state in the helicity basis @xmath35    the normalization of the wave function components @xmath36 can be calculated as @xmath37 here we used that @xmath38    from the normalization calculated using eq .",
    "( [ eq2.1 ] ) we define a deuteron momentum density @xmath39 as @xmath40      the deuteron state @xmath41 satisfies the eigenvalue equation @xmath42 with @xmath43 being the deuteron binding energy and @xmath44 the nn potential .",
    "this eigenvalue equation is projected on the basis states @xmath45 introduced in the previous section .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ label2 ] ) for representing @xmath46 one obtains @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "thus , the eigenvalue equation for deuteron binding energy consists in the helicity basis of a set of two coupled integral equations . @xmath49 where the index @xmath50 corresponds to 1 or 0 . since the wave function components @xmath51 have no azimuthal dependence , the @xmath52-integral in eq .",
    "( [ label1 ] ) can be carried out independently .",
    "defining @xmath53 the coupled integral equations are actually only two - dimensional and their final form reads @xmath54    the eigenvalue equation , eq .",
    "( [ label20 ] ) , is consistent with our treatment of the nn continuum of ref .",
    "@xcite , where we derived coupled integral equations in two variables for the nn scattering equation .",
    "we would like to add the remark that it is not necessary to use any specific information about the the deuteron , namely spin , isospin and parity .",
    "the set of equations , eq .",
    "( [ label1 ] ) , is valid for arbitrary @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "any calculation based on a realistic nn potential will then reveal that a solution of the eigenvalue problem exists only for the well known quantum numbers .",
    "therefore , the scheme laid out above automatically provides full insight , no a - priori knowledge needs to be employed . at this level",
    "the question of total angular momentum of that bound state is undetermined and will be considered in section iii .      in this subsection",
    "we want to relate @xmath58 as given in eq .",
    "( [ label2 ] ) to the standard partial wave representation of the deuteron .",
    "the standard representation of the total angular momentum basis @xmath59 with the normalization @xmath60 is used for projecting the wave function @xmath61 .",
    "again , we use the fixed spin and isospin of the deuteron . the quantum numbers @xmath62 remain arbitrary , and we obtain @xmath63 recalling the explicit representation of the helicity state @xcite , @xmath64 and using eq .",
    "( [ label3 ] ) , the scalar product of partial wave and helicity basis can be worked out as @xmath65 here we used the relation @xmath66 together with an addition theorem for wigner s d - functions @xmath67 hence , the projection of the deuteron state on the partial wave basis as defined in eq .",
    "( [ label4 ] ) is given by @xmath68 this projection exists only for @xmath69 and even @xmath70 , as enforced by the even deuteron parity , and one obtains @xmath71 at this point the remaining properties for the projections @xmath72 can be found by explicit calculation .",
    "in other words the fact that @xmath70 has to be 0 and 2 , and consequently @xmath73=1 , has to be inferred numerically from the solution of eq .",
    "( [ label15 ] ) .",

    "as an object with internal structure it is tempting to investigate the deuteron properties three dimensionally . to that aim we study the deuteron properties in a representation based on the total helicity of the two - body system taken along the relative momentum of the two particles .",

    "we derived two sets of two coupled eigenvalue equations for deuteron wave functions .",

    "the two one - dimensional amplitude components are each linear combination of the standard @xmath0 and @xmath1 wave function components .",
    "the calculated deuteron binding energy determined in both ways agrees perfectly with the value determined in standard calculations based on partial wave representations of the deuteron eigenvalue equation .",
    "the newly defined helicity wave function components depend on wigner s d - function and the @xmath168 dependent part are linear combinations of the standard @xmath0 and @xmath1 waves of the deuteron .",
    "we display their properties for different projections of the total angular momentum @xmath160 .",
    "like for nn scattering we can connect the helicity amplitudes to the standard @xmath0 and @xmath1 waves and find perfect numerical agreement with the partial wave components determined in a standard manner .",
    "finally we evaluate various spin and momentum dependent probabilities in a fashion , which is exact with respect to the angular dependence .",
    "this is made possible by using the ` operator form ' of the deuteron state .",
    "it is conceivable that in quasi elastic electrodesintegration of the deuteron one may be able to see those momentum dependent spin distributions .",
    "summarizing , we extended a recently introduced helicity representation for nn scattering to the nn bound state .",
    "this formulation leads to new forms for deuteron wave function components , which can be determined by two coupled equations .",
