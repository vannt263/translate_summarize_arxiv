    "in systems of charged particles , the traditional continuum poisson - nernst - planck ( pnp ) model has been widely used for modeling and simulating a variety of interesting phenomena , such as ion distributions around charged particles@xcite , and flow of ions across channels@xcite and axons@xcite .",
    "a defect in the pnp model is the point charge treatment of ions which in fact have finite volumes .",
    "this may lead to unphysical concentration values in the neighborhood of biomolecules@xcite and hence can not properly capture the size effects which may play important role in ion permeation through ion channels .    a great deal of efforts",
    "have been devoted to remedy this disadvantage and improve the pnp model to provide reliable predictions through including ionic size effects and ion - ion correlations . in equilibrium and uniform",
    "ionic size , andelman et  al .",
    "have incorporated the ionic size effects into the traditional continuum model , and provided the explicit expressions of ion concentrations and the uniform size modified poisson - boltzmann ( smpb ) equation@xcite .",
    "this is derived by introducing an additional solvent entropy term , representing the unfavorable energy modeling the overpacking or crowding of ions and solvent molecules , into the free energy form .",
    "fenley s group has studied this smpb model explicitly through comparisons with the original poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) model , and investigations of the sensitivities to parameterization@xcite . by using a rigorous lattice gas method , chu et  al .",
    "extended this uniform smpb model to make it work for two different ion sizes and studied ion binding to dna duplexes which showed improved agreements with experimental data@xcite . in the case of three or more different sizes ,",
    "the rigorous lattice gas method is hard to apply to give an explicit smpb equation , but an alternative size modified poisson - nernst - planck ( smpnp ) model is derived in our previous work which can be considered as an implicit smpb model in equilibrium@xcite .",
    "li et  al . have provided some mathematical analysis on the energy functional for the smpb model@xcite . in recent work by liu and eisenberg@xcite ,",
    "they considered the size effects from all spherical ions , water molecules ( treated as polarizable spheres ) and interstitial voids , and derived an entropy form of those spheres of arbitrary diameter and voids . to further account for the correlation effect of ions , liu and",
    "eisenberg s work also included a high - order derivative term of potential in free energy functional derived by santangelo@xcite which has similar form to cahn - hilliard concentration - gradient expansions@xcite .",
    "the resulted fourth order poisson - fermi equation@xcite ( for equilibrium condition ) and poisson - nernst - planck - fermi equations ( for nonequilibrium condition)@xcite can account for the steric effect of ions and water molecules , the correlation effect of crowded ions , the screening effect of polar water , as well as the charge / space competition effect of ions and water molecules .",
    "these models were shown to be able to capture critical phenomena such as ion binding , blocking , and selective permeation of l - type calcium channels@xcite .",
    "apart from the above mean field modified models , coupling of density functional theory ( dft ) and pnp model has also been used to account for ion - ion interactions in solutions .",
    "the major description of dft lies in the construction of the excess helmholtz free energy@xcite .",
    "rosenfeld derived the fundamental measure theory ( fmt ) to express the excess helmholtz free energy for hard sphere mixtures@xcite , which contains four scalar and two vector weight functions , and has been widely used in many literatures@xcite .",
    "not long after that , he extended the original fmt , that works for three dimensional inhomogeneous fluids , to predict a freezing transition of the hard - sphere fluid into a solid@xcite .",
    "at the same time , lots of contributions have been made to improve the fmt .",
    "kierlik and rosinberg have proposed a simplified version of fmt , which requires only four scalar weight functions@xcite .",
    "roth et  al . and wu et  al .",
    "have independently , published the white - bear version@xcite or the modified fmt@xcite using the mansoori - carnahan - starling - leland bulk equation of state to make simulation results more accurate .",
    "for inhomogeneous fluids of nonspherical hard particles , mecke et  al .",
    "have derived a fundamental measure theory using the gauss - bonnet theorem@xcite . in numerical calculation , due to the complexity of fmt ,",
    "calculations are mostly reduced to 1d cases using geometric symmetry of the simulation systems@xcite .",
    "only a few literatures provided 3d results@xcite . when fmt is combined with the pnp model to include hard sphere repulsion for non - equilibrium transport studies ,",
    "the final integro - differential equations are more complex and computationally expensive , especially in the situation with biomolecular systems .",

    "have made some mathematical analysis on the pnp system for ion flow with density functional theory for hard sphere interaction in 1d situation@xcite .",
    "so far , most studies are restrained to 1d case@xcite .",
    "recently , gillespie et  al.@xcite and meng et  al.@xcite have reported simulations of 3d systems .",
    "the main difficulty is the calculation of the nonlocal components originated from the helmholtz free energy .    in this work ,",
    "we propose a 3d local hard sphere pnp ( lhspnp ) model for real biomolecular systems in ionic solutions . on one hand",
    ", 3d simulation can count for the irregular boundary of biomolecule which plays an essential role during biological processes , such as ionic flow across channel , protein modification or interaction with a protein or substrate molecule and cell signaling@xcite .",
    "these shape information is hard to be captured in 1d case resulted from the symmetric boundary simplifications . on the other hand , the local hard sphere ( lhs ) model",
    "largely simplifies the numerical calculations while it still partially maintains the effects of hard sphere repulsion .",
    "we improve the pnp model by considering the hard sphere repulsion from fmt .",
    "the excess helmholtz free energy of fmt is employed to generate the excess hard sphere chemical potential which is completely ignored in the pnp model . different from the ideal chemical potential , this excess component of a certain ion at a given point is determined by an integration about all ion concentrations in a region around the given point , rather than the certain ion concentration at the given point .",
    "this integration is in the form of convolution .",
    "gillespie et  al . have used fast fourier transform to deal with the convolution@xcite , while meng et  al .",
    "have used the definition of dirac delta function and change of variables to transform these 3d integrals into 2d integrals on spheres and remove the singularity in the integrands@xcite .",
    "though both algorithms can solve the integro - differential equations , they cost lots of computer memory and time during calculation .",
    "we aim to construct an excess chemical potential in a point to point way like the ideal component for 3d simulations of ionic solutions .",
    "liu et  al .",
    "have derived a lhs excess chemical potential in 1d case and made theoretical analysis on the model problem based on geometric singular perturbation theory@xcite . in our work ,",
    "we concentrate on the more complex 3d case and simplify the integration using an expansion of the integrand under small ionic diameters to obtain the final lhspnp model .",
    "it s found that the 3d lhspnp model is exactly the same as liu s when reduced to 1d case .",
    "we examine the effects of the lhs model both from a theoretical and a numerical point of view . for the case of one component homogeneous fluid",
    ", the virial coefficients are investigated through the equations of state from the fmt , our local approximation and the size modified model@xcite studied in former work . for fmt , the equation of state",
    "is known to be the percus - yevick compressibility equation , equivalent to scaled particle theory , which provides the first three virial coefficients exactly .",
    "frydel and levin have shown that the size modified model only predicts the first virial coefficient exactly@xcite .",
    "based on these discussions and the relations between bulk grand canonical potentials from the micro and macro views , we derive the virial coefficients for our local approximation .",
    "we find that the lhs model provides the first two virial coefficients exactly , which performs better than the size modified model .",
    "numerically , to investigate the effects of the hard sphere repulsion from lhs model , we make numerical comparisons for a spherical cavity case among the pnp , lhspnp , smpnp models and the monte carlo ( mc ) simulation . for the four parts of the local excess chemical potential in lhspnp",
    ", we notice that the first term is , to some extent , similar to the local excess chemical potential of the smpnp model , though lhspnp and smpnp are based on two different theoretical frameworks .",
    "we consider two counterion species in the solution , which helps us to understand competitions between them under the pnp , lhspnp and smpnp models .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the method section offers a detailed description about the derivation of the lhspnp model , its equation of state in one component uniform fluid , and the numerical method to solve the lhspnp equations .",
    "the result and discussion section provides numerical results of a spherical cavity in various bulk concentrations with the pnp , lhspnp , smpnp models and mc simulation and also some discussions about the observed phenomena .",

    "in addition to the ideal chemical potential considered in the original poisson - nernst - planck ( pnp ) equations , an excess chemical potential arising from hard sphere repulsion is incorporated to the equations to make the model more accurate . using the constitutive relations about the flux and the electrochemical potential , we have the following expression of ion flux @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the flux , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the mobility and concentration for the @xmath4th ion species respectively",

    "it s notable that the pb description for continuum model is equivalent to the steady state pnp equations at equilibrium state@xcite .",
    "the diameters of these two ion species required in lhspnp , smpnp and mc calculations are : @xmath94k@xmath95 and @xmath94cl@xmath96@xcite .",
    "these values are larger than pure ionic diameters because a hydration shell is considered around ions in solution .",
    "figure  [ cha1 ] and figure  [ cha4 ] illustrate the density profiles when bulk concentrations are 0.1 m ( upper panels ) and 0.5 m ( lower panels ) .",
    "it is worth noting that because of volume exclusion , the ion density in mc simulation vanishes in the region within an ion radius to the cavity surface . to make a clearer comparison ,",
    "the curves from mc data in both figures are shifted half the ion diameters towards the origin . as shown in the upper panel of figure  [ cha1 ] at low bulk concentration and low central charge ,",
    "the simulation results among the four methods are close to each other and the difference between the smpnp and lhspnp model is small . however ,",
    "when the central charge increases to -40@xmath97 shown in figure  [ cha4 ] , the concentration of k@xmath92 from the mc simulation is considerably larger than those from the smpnp and lhspnp calculations .",
    "this seems that the smpnp and lhspnp models overestimate the volume exclusion effects in the environment of strong electric field and condensed ionic density . while in mc simulation",
    ", the ion correlation effects that are missed in smpnp and lhspnp can enhance the condensation of counter ions in the situation .",
    "as shown in both figures  [ cha1 ] and [ cha4 ] , the lhspnp tends to result in a slightly higher counter ion concentration near the sphere than the smpnp model .    in order to investigate the competition among various kinds of counterions , two positive ion species , k@xmath92 and ca@xmath98 , and one negative ion species , cl@xmath93",
    "are added in the solution .",

    "if not specified , the bulk concentration of k@xmath92 is set to be @xmath99 m .",
    "only the bulk concentration of ca@xmath98 , @xmath100 is varied .",
    "the bulk concentration of cl@xmath93 , @xmath101 is then determined from the neutrality condition .",
    "three models , lhspnp , smpnp and pb models are used to simulate the spherical cavity in ionic solution , respectively .",
    "the concentration profiles of different ion species in the steady state are obtained from the numerical solutions of those models for comparison .",
    "the spherical cavity contains a central charge of -40@xmath97 and the diameter of ca@xmath98 is @xmath102@xcite . in the figures below ,",
    "solid curve is applied for k@xmath92 , and dashed curve for ca@xmath98 .",
    "figure  [ ca ] shows the concentration profiles of ca@xmath98 obtained from the three models at two different bulk values . in figure  [ ca](a ) , when the bulk concentration of ca@xmath98 is @xmath103 m , the pb predictions overestimate the concentrations compared with those of smpnp and lhspnp . and",
    "the concentration from pb decreases quickly to smaller values than the other two predictions in a narrow region within a distance of 0.4@xmath91 to the cavity surface . however , when @xmath104 m , the smpnp and lhs predictions are always higher than the pb , even near the spherical surface .",
    "this indicates pb model can also lead to underestimation of concentration for counterions when its bulk concentration is small enough .",
    "this may be explained as follows . according to the boltzmann distribution ,",
    "the following equations hold : @xmath105 eq .",
    "[ ckca ] can be reduced to @xmath106 , when @xmath107 and @xmath100 are 0.1 m and @xmath108 m , respectively .",
    "the reduced potential @xmath109 is about -6 under the given neutrality boundary conditions , resulting in the ratio @xmath110 larger than 2 .",
    "therefore , k@xmath111 plays a leading role in neutralizing the fixed negative charge , while the concentration of ca@xmath98 may be underestimated by the pb model .",
    "besides , it s easy to see that in both subfigures of figure  [ ca ] the predictions from pb model decrease faster than the others , which can be explained by eq .",
    "this heavily exponential decrease is resulted from the quick enhancement of the reduced potential @xmath112 in the vicinity of the spherical cavity .",
    "figure  [ k ] presents the predictions of k@xmath92 at the same bulk values mentioned above for figure  [ ca ] . according to the neutrality boundary condition ,",
    "the @xmath101 values are then 0.102 m and 0.1002 m , respectively .",
    "as is known , the counterion concentration predicted from the traditional pb model is unphysically high in the vicinity of the biomolecule@xcite .",
    "this is clearly shown in the two subfigures of figure  [ k ] .",
    "the concentration on the spherical surface can reach as high as 13.5 m when @xmath113 m .",
    "as the radical distance increases , the concentration decreases to the bulk value quickly . for smpnp and lhspnp models ,",
    "a stratification of k@xmath92 is observed , which is quite different from the monotonic phenomenon of the pb model . with the increasing of the radical distance , the concentration first increases to a highest value then decreases to the bulk value slowly . in smpnp ,",
    "ionic size effects are incorporated through adding an additional entropy term to the electrostatic energy , leading to an extra excess chemical potential . in lhspnp , hard sphere repulsion described by the fmt",
    "is added to the electrostatic energy and then the excess chemical potential is approximated locally .",
    "both models can capture the stratification of k@xmath92 through adding extra terms to the chemical potential .",
    "this change originates from the reasonable assumption that ions in solution are regarded as finite volumes rather than point charges .",
    "since ca@xmath98 carries one more positive elementary charge than k@xmath111 , huge accumulation of ca@xmath98 around the charged spherical cavity prevents the enhancement of k@xmath111 .",
    "nevertheless , as the radical distance becomes larger , the electric field strength becomes smaller and so does the concentration of ca@xmath98 .",
    "thus the repelling from the ca@xmath98 weakens and the concentration of k@xmath111 increases to a certain value in a finite distance . at further distance",
    ", the weakening of electric field makes the concentration of k@xmath111 decrease .",
    "this explains the stratification of k@xmath111 from results of smpnp and lhspnp models .",
    "next , we vary the @xmath100 value from @xmath108 m to @xmath114 m in which the ratio of @xmath115 can reach as high as @xmath116 , while the other conditions remain the same as aforementioned . under these circumstances ,",
    "figures  [ pb][lhs ] illustrate the concentration profiles of the two positive ion species resulted from the pb , smpnp and lhspnp models . in figure  [ pb ] , it s observed that both positive ion concentrations decrease as the radical distance increases and that the concentration of k@xmath92 is larger than that of ca@xmath98 under same conditions .",
    "these phenomena can be explained by the boltzmann concentrations defined in eq .",
    "[ cca ] and eq .",
    "similar explanations have been presented in above analysis for figure  [ ca ] and figure  [ k ] .",
    "in addition , with the decrease of the @xmath100 , the enhancement of @xmath117k@xmath118 is clear ( figure  [ pb](a ) ) , while @xmath117ca@xmath119 decreases accordingly ( figure  [ pb](b ) ) .",
    "this also occurs in the smpnp and lhspnp models as shown in figure  [ smpnp ] and figure  [ lhs ] .    in figure  [ smpnp](a ) and figure  [ lhs](a ) , the stratification of k@xmath92 disappears when the bulk concentration of ca@xmath98 is smaller than @xmath120 m .",
    "this is a straightforward result from the decrease of @xmath100 .",
    "though ca@xmath98 ions are much easier to be attracted to the spherical surface than k@xmath92 , the number of ca@xmath98 is so tiny that they have no significant influence on the accumulation of k@xmath92 .",
    "therefore , a great number of k@xmath92 can be attracted to the neighborhood of the spherical surface . as the radical distance increases , the concentration of k@xmath92 decreases gradually to the bulk values attributed to the weakening of the electric potential .",
    "in contrast to the stratification of k@xmath92 appeared at certain cases , the concentration of ca@xmath98 always decreases monotonically with the increasing of the radical distance , even when its bulk value is @xmath114 m .",
    "this means the bulk concentration is not the essential factor for ion stratification .",
    "for smpnp at given conditions , li et  al . have shown that the phenomenon depends on the ratio of ionic charge amount over its volume@xcite .",
    "for the similar spherical case with mixed ion species , the concentration of the ion with the largest or the smallest ratio changes monotonically as the radical distance increases , while the other ion species concentrations may appear with stratification phenomenon . in our settings ,",
    "the following relation holds : @xmath121 as a result , the change of ca@xmath98 is always monotonic , while the stratification occurs only for k@xmath92 . in figure  [ lhs ] ,",
    "the numerical results from lhs models also show these properties .",
    "however , difference between the smpnp and the lhspnp models is also observed in figure  [ smpnp ] and figure  [ lhs ] .",
    "when @xmath122 m , the stratification of k@xmath92 occurs in the smpnp model but not in the lhspnp model .",
    "furthermore , there is also a small difference between ca@xmath98 concentration profiles from smpnp ( figure  [ smpnp](b ) ) and lhspnp ( figure  [ lhs](b ) ) models .",
    "the ca@xmath98 concentration from lhspnp simulations is smaller than that from smpnp under the same boundary conditions .",
    "this indicates that the lhspnp model captures more about the exclusion effects of ca@xmath98 than the smpnp model . in smpnp , when the bulk concentration @xmath100 is @xmath120 m , ca@xmath98 is still much easier to be attracted than k@xmath92 .",
    "but for lhspnp model , the number of ca@xmath98 is not enough to prevent k@xmath92 from accumulation around the sphere .",
    "therefore , in lhspnp , the stratification of k@xmath92 does not happen under this condition .",
    "when @xmath100 is @xmath123 m or less , no stratification occurs in either smpnp or lhspnp modeling .",
    "we have proposed a local hard sphere pnp model to account for hard sphere repulsion in three dimensional ionic solutions .",
    "compared with the pnp model , the lhspnp model contains an extra local excess chemical potential , derived from the expansion of the variation of the excess helmholtz free energy ( excess chemical potential ) from fmt .",
    "this local expression avoids solving of integro - differential equations which requires much more computer memory and time .",
    "it is interesting to notice that one component of our local excess chemical potential is similar to the key part in smpnp model .",
    "this indicates that in some sense , the lhspnp model essentially contains the previous smpb / smpnp models@xcite , though these two models are from different backgrounds .",
    "the closeness between these two models under certain conditions are also demonstrated by numerical computations in this work .",
    "theoretical study on the equation of state of one component homogeneous fluid shows that the lhs model can predict exactly the first two virial coefficients , performing better than the size modified model which only provides the first coefficient accurately .",
    "numerical tests for an example of a spherical cavity in ionic solutions indicate the lhspnp model can avoid unphysical accumulation of counterions around biomolecular surface .",
    "but when the bulk concentration and the potential are high , the concentration results from lhspnp model are lower than those from the mc simulation . under certain bulk concentrations in mixed ionic solution , we find that the concentration of one counterion species in lhspnp equilibrium simulation is higher than that in pnp simulation .",
    "furthermore , the stratification of counterion is observed when two different counterion species are included in the solution system .",
    "these phenomena from lhspnp model are quite similar to those from smpnp .",
