    "various approaches inspired by a combination of statistical physics and kinetic theory have been proposed in recent years for the description of economic exchanges and market societies , see for example @xcite . in these approaches ,",
    "individuals trading with each other are identified as particles or gas molecules which undergo collisions .",
    "methods and tools based on physics have proved useful also in such socio - economic contexts to investigate the emergence of macroscopic features from a whole of microscopic interactions . with this perspective , some mathematically founded market economy models , characterized by the ability to also incorporate taxation and redistribution processes , have been proposed and studied in @xcite . in these papers ,",
    "society is equated to a system composed by a large number of heterogeneous individuals who exchange money through binary and other nonlinear interactions and are divided into a finite number @xmath3 of income classes .",
    "the models are expressed by a system of @xmath3 nonlinear ordinary differential equations of the kinetic - discretized boltzmann type , involving transition probabilities relative to the jumps of individuals from a class to another .",
    "the specification of these probabilities and of the parameters which define the trading rules , including the tax rates pertaining to different income classes and other properties of the system , determines the dynamics .",
    "collective features like the income profile and related indicators like the gini index - here , a measure of economic inequality - result from the interplay of a range of such interactions . due to the presence of the mentioned transition probabilities ,",
    "the process is stochastic @xcite but the differential equations governing the evolution of the fraction of individuals in the classes are deterministic .    in real world , however , the time evolution of an economic system is governed not only by fixed rules and parameters : it is subject to the effects of unpredictable perturbing factors as well .",
    "to consider the influence of these factors , we recently introduced a langevin - type kinetic model @xcite , incorporating an ito - type additive noise term into the set of dynamical equations .",
    "several numerical simulations provided evidence of the persistence of patterns already established in the deterministic problem @xcite , also in agreement with previously explored empirical results @xcite : in particular , they exhibited a negative correlation between economic inequality and social mobility .",
    "with reference to the case without income conservation they reported a positive correlation between the gini index and the total income .",
    "we regard this as a sign of reliability of the models .",
    "the noise additivity is a perceived drawback though , as it does not prevent uncontrollably large fluctuations from being compared to class populations , which is unrealistic .",
    "the goal of this paper is to overcome this limitation by considering instead a multiplicative noise term .",
    "this requires a more subtle procedure than that proposed in @xcite .",
    "attention is then focused on the sign of the correlations between income inequality , mobility and total income under different conditions as described in section [ section222 ] below .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the structure of the langevin - type kinetic model .",
    "different choices for the construction of the noise term of this structure allow to formulate different models . here , in particular , we define two of them : one , in the first subsection , for which only conservation of the total population holds true , and another , in a second subsection , for which both conservation of total population and total income hold true",
    ". the features of the evolution in time of the solutions of these two models are discussed in section [ section222 ] .",
    "if the total income @xmath1 is constant in time and not too large , the correlations between the gini index and an indicator quantifying social mobility is negative . the same negativity was obtained in @xcite in the presence of additive noise , the only difference being the absence of any restriction on the values of @xmath1 .",
    "when income conservation does not hold true , the sign of the correlation between the total income and the gini index can either be positive or negative , depending on the magnitude of @xmath1 , when the noise is multiplicative ( the case in the present paper ) .",
    "on the other hand , the correlation is positive when the noise is additive ( the case in @xcite ) .",
    "the conclusion summarizes these facts and some directions for future research .",
    "a simple model describing monetary exchanges between pairs of individuals in a society divided into @xmath3 income classes can be formulated through a system of differential equations of the form @xmath4 here , @xmath5 denotes the fraction of individuals which at time @xmath6 belong to the @xmath7-th class and the constant coefficients @xmath8 $ ] , such that @xmath9 for any fixed @xmath10 and @xmath11 , express the probability that an individual of the @xmath10-th class will belong to the @xmath7-th class after a direct interaction with an individual of the @xmath11-th class .",
    "the expression for these coefficients , valid for the case in which the average incomes are given by @xmath12 with @xmath13 , first derived in @xcite and then used e.g. also in @xcite , reads when written in compact form : @xmath14 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{s}{\\delta r } \\ , \\bigg [ \\delta_{h , i+1 } ( 1-\\delta_{kn})\\:p_{i+1,k }   + \\delta_{h , i-1}\\:(1-\\delta_{k1})\\:p_{k , i-1 } \\bigg ] \\label{cihk_eqn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath15 . here",
    ", @xmath16 denotes a unit of money , @xmath17 denotes the kronecker s delta , and @xmath18 expresses the probability that in an encounter between an individual of the @xmath10-th class and one of the @xmath11-th class , the one who pays is the former one .",
    "we take here @xmath19 and extend the values of @xmath18 in ( [ defofphk ] ) to allow the indices @xmath10 and @xmath11 to go from @xmath20 to @xmath21 through the definitions @xmath22 for any @xmath11 , and @xmath23 for any @xmath11 .",
    "we emphasize that the choice of the coefficients ( [ cihk_eqn ] ) is forced , if conservation of total income has to hold true for all @xmath24 once it holds true for @xmath25 ( see the proof of theorem 4.2 in @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , there is a certain degree of arbitrariness in the choice of @xmath26 .",
    "the specific formula ( [ defofphk ] ) corresponds to a choice made in @xcite , suggested by the observation that usually poor people pay and receive less than rich people .",
    "indeed , the @xmath18 in ( [ defofphk ] ) with indices @xmath10 and @xmath11 different from @xmath27 and @xmath3 are equal to @xmath28 ( and those with @xmath29 are equal to @xmath30 ) . the special treatment of the coefficients with indices @xmath31 or @xmath3 is due to the impossibility of moving from the first class to a poorer one and from the @xmath3-th class to a richer one .",
    "a langevin - type kinetic model @xcite can now be constructed as a system of stochastic equations of the form @xmath32 in which the first term on the r.h.s . in eq .",
    "( [ langevin ] ) represents the deterministic contribution and the second term corresponds to noise .",
    "the interpretation of equation ( [ langevin ] ) is as follows .",
    "the first term takes into account direct money exchanges , ruled by norms , and behavioral attitudes which are the same for individuals belonging to the same class .",
    "the second term represents uncertainties randomly occurring , which also affect the change in the population distribution .    in the following",
    "we take the operator @xmath33 as in ( [ kin - eq ] ) , @xmath34 i.e. we take @xmath33 to mimic that component of the models in @xcite which just describes the direct monetary exchanges without taxation and redistribution . as for the stochastic part ,",
    "the @xmath35 denote @xmath3 independent gaussian stochastic variables and @xmath36 denotes the noise amplitude .",
    "the form of the operator @xmath37 depends on the conservation requirements to which we want the model to obey .      enforcing total population conservation , we must get @xmath38 for any choice of @xmath39 . a way to fulfill condition ( [ pop - cons ] ) together with a proportionality condition between the random variations in the class populations and the population themselves is to define , starting from the random @xmath35 , new variations @xmath40 , or in matrix form @xmath41 with @xmath42}^{(2)}(x ) = \\left\\ { \\begin{array}{l } x_i\\left(1 - x_i \\right ) ,   { \\qquad \\rm {   if   } } \\qquad   i = j\\\\ - x_i   x_j ,    { \\qquad   \\qquad \\rm {   if   } } \\qquad   i \\ne j .",
    "\\end{array } \\right .   \\label{firstproposal}\\ ] ] the formula ( [ firstproposal ] ) provides an operator @xmath43}^{(2)}$ ] which allows to construct , starting from random variables , a multiplicative noise term compatible with the conservation of the total population ( pop - const ) .",
    "incidentally , we observe that in the following , as in @xcite , we normalize the total population to @xmath27 . on the contrary , we emphasize that allowing a variation of the total income related to stochastic noise amounts to consider for example a society which also interacts with the external world : capital inflow or outflow could occur due to import - export of goods , incoming - outgoing of tourism , investment and stock trading .      alternatively , we may consider a closed system for which we require conservation of the total income @xmath44 of the population , the total income coincides with the average income of the population itself . ] .",
    "we then point out that from now on we restrict attention on values of @xmath1 satisfying @xmath45 thanks to the inequalities ( [ constraintsonmu ] ) the possible occurrence can be excluded of situations in which all individuals belong to the poorest or to the richest income class .",
    "similar odd cases are not of interest if one wants to deal with realistic situations . in other words , taking @xmath1 as in ( [ constraintsonmu ] ) does not represent a strong assumption .",
    "in addition to ( [ pop - cons ] ) , a further condition has now to be imposed , i.e. @xmath46 for any choice of @xmath39 . in order to construct a diffusion matrix satisfying both",

    "we emphasize that a warning as discussed in the next lines is in order here .    at each step , say at each time @xmath102 with @xmath103 , a vector @xmath101 is picked whose components @xmath35 for @xmath63 are gaussian random numbers ranging from @xmath104 to @xmath27 . here",

    "+ by repeating , if necessary , the procedure here illustrated , one ends up with @xmath147 for all @xmath63 , for some @xmath148 .",
    "to investigate the stochastic processes of the two models designed in section [ section111 ] , we numerically solved the equations ( [ langevin ] ) and took the average of various quantities over a large number of stochastic realizations .",
    "of course , no equilibria have to be expected in the present case . to draw some conclusions , we need to recall the definition - more precisely , a variant of it , suitable for the present case - of an indicator of social mobility introduced in @xcite .",
    "this indicator , which expresses the collective probability of class advancement of all classes from the @xmath149-th to the @xmath150-th one , is given by @xmath151 we calculated the value of @xmath0 in a succession of equally spaced instants @xmath152 along the evolution in time of several solutions of eq .",

    "are reasonable in a realistic perspective ( see e.g. @xcite ) because they are compatible with a distribution of individuals in which most of the population belongs to the low - middle classes .",
    "the negativity of the correlation which we get is in agreement with a great deal of empirical data @xcite and provides evidence of some robustness against random perturbations of the corresponding property established for systems without noise in @xcite .",
    "a few samples of correlations @xmath158 ( gini and mobility index ) are given in table [ tab : tablergmconserved ] for the case with constant total income and in table [ tab : tablergmnonconserved ] for the case with varying total income .",
    "for our simulations , we considered the difference @xmath159 between class average incomes equal to @xmath160 and the noise amplitude @xmath36 equal to @xmath161 .",
    "the correlations were obtained as averages of @xmath162 realizations , each over @xmath163 integration steps . in these samples ,",
    "three initial conditions - the same in the tables [ tab : tablergmconserved ] and [ tab : tablergmnonconserved ] - compatible with values of the total income equal to @xmath164 , @xmath165 and @xmath166 respectively , are considered ( figure [ fig : asymptoticdeterministicsol ] displays the initial condition corresponding to the asymptotic stationary distribution for the system without noise ( [ kin - eq ] ) with @xmath167 ) . and for each of these initial conditions , three different average results are reported .",
    "we also stress here that the distributions we get after the @xmath163 integration steps remain in fact quite close to the distributions from which they evolve , which are equilibria if noise is absent .",
    "we measure the closeness by calculating in correspondence to each realization the difference between the average ( of the @xmath163 values attained during evolution ) @xmath168 of each component of the distribution and the corresponding initial value @xmath169 ; in addition , we calculate the standard deviation @xmath170 of each component @xmath124 .",
    "we find that the differences @xmath171 take values whose order of magnitude typically are between @xmath172 and @xmath173 , the @xmath170 take values whose order of magnitude typically oscillate between @xmath174 and @xmath175 , whereas the values of the relative standard variations @xmath176 typically are of the order of @xmath174 .    .correlations @xmath177 ( gini and mobility index ) computed in nine cases in which total income @xmath1 is conserved , with noise amplitude @xmath178 .",

    "since the values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 at equilibrium are mutually related , the correlations depend on @xmath2 . in order to further check this dependence ,",
    "we ran simulations over 100 cycles varying @xmath1 , the results of which are shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "@xmath1 is varied approximately between @xmath179 , corresponding for @xmath2 to @xmath180 .",
    "each simulation consists of 50 stochastic realizations , each over 5000 steps and starting from the same equilibrium configuration ; the solid circles in the plot represent the simulation data .",
    "figure [ fig3]a shows that the @xmath0-@xmath2 correlation is positive in the interval @xmath181 ; for @xmath182 , the aforementioned correlation becomes negative .",
    "therefore , according to our model , the great gatsby law , which states that the correlation between inequality and economic mobility is negative , strictly holds for @xmath182 .",
    "this is actually a range representing the pre - taxation values of @xmath2 that includes most industrialized countries .",
    "figure [ fig3]b shows that the @xmath1-@xmath2 correlation is positive in the interval @xmath183 but gets negative thereafter .",
    "we thus identify a window of values for @xmath2 for which the influx of wealth to the system contributes in decreasing inequality .",
    "finally , figure [ figrmum ] shows that the total income @xmath1 and mobility @xmath0 always have a strong positive correlation which shows a slow increase with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "this could be understood from an established thermodynamic allusion : in a canonical ensemble , for any reasonable definition of mobility , we expect a strong positive correlation between mobility and temperature ; and in turn temperature variations will be strongly correlated with the variations in the free energy ( corresponding to income in our case ) .",
    "in this article , we proposed two different models to analyze the time evolution of income distribution resulting from multiple economic exchanges , in the presence of a multiplicative noise ( abiding the ito formulation ) .",
    "the presence of noise causes a continuous dynamical adjustment of the income distribution , while still staying reasonably close to the large time steady state limit that it would have reached in the absence of noise .",
    "ensemble averaging over a large set of stochastic realizations , we observed the emergence of correlations between the gini inequality index @xmath2 and a suitably defined mobility index @xmath0 .",
    "the respective correlations between mobility @xmath0 with the gini index @xmath2 and that between total income @xmath1 with the gini index @xmath2 , for the time varying case as we consider here , depict association between these quantities . both the mobility @xmath0 and the total income @xmath1 show steady decrease with increasing @xmath2 , a reflection of the fact that an increasing inequality contributes to decreased social mobility ( figure [ fig3 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "an increasing inequality ( reflected by an increasing value of @xmath2 ) portrays the strength of interaction between the social mobility and total income which then shows a marginal steady increase ( figure [ figrmum ] ) .",
    "some relevant comparisons with results from an equivalent additive noise case are also drawn .",
    "probably , a more realistic model should involve a weighted combination of both additive and multiplicative stochastic perturbation .",
    "indeed , certain events act as additive noise , whereas others are more properly represented by multiplicative noise .",
    "while economics modeling is replete with examples of application of additive noise @xcite , implementation of multiplicative noise is also not unknown @xcite .",
    "correlated noise spectra , like ornstein - uhlenbeck , as used in other branches of material science @xcite , could be considered as well , which is one of our ongoing research projects .",
    "more complicated noise structures , resembling power - law scaling have found popular applications in cognition science @xcite , another possibility for future investigation .",
    "a further extension of the models developed in @xcite and here could involve studying the impact of the coefficients @xmath184 themselves changing with the income distribution .",
    "finally , it would be of great interest to investigate the dependence of the entire dynamical process , both on the amplitude as also on the nature of the noise distribution , as alluded to in some of the earlier references in other fields ."
