    "the recent discovery of the most distant quasar known , ulas j1120 + 0641 @xcite , with a redshift of 7.0842 @xmath4 0.0004 @xcite , provides a unique opportunity to probe the epoch of reionisation at a time when the process was potentially just ending . as noted by @xcite ,",
    "this object exhibits strong absorption on the blue side of its lyman-@xmath0  emission line .",
    "the red side of its lyman-@xmath0  line may also be somewhat weaker than expected based on the strength of its other emission lines , notably c  iv .",
    "these traits have jointly been interpreted as evidence for neutral gas in the vicinity of ulas j1120 + 0641 , with the weak lyman-@xmath0  line being due to damping wing absorption extending to @xmath5  . in a scenario where the neutral gas is intergalactic , models of the quasar s proximity zone",
    "suggest that the surrounding igm may be @xmath610 per cent neutral @xcite .",
    "the lack of intervening metal absorption lines further suggests that any neutral gas would have to be highly metal poor , particularly if it is confined to a discrete absorber @xcite .    the case for neutral gas in the vicinity of ulas",
    "j1120 + 0641 , whether localized or intergalactic , depends strongly on the reality of the damping wing absorption . a truncated proximity zone , while unusual , could be due to an optically thick ( @xmath7 ) absorber in the vicinity of the quasar , but a damping wing requires a large column density ( @xmath8 ) of neutral gas . a challenge in analysing such high - redshift quasars",
    ", however , is that their intrinsic spectra , including their lyman-@xmath0  emission lines , exhibit significant variation between objects .",
    "this combined with the fact that the blue side of lyman-@xmath0  is often strongly affected by lyman-@xmath0  forest absorption ( generally arising from ionized gas ) means that the intrinsic shape of lyman-@xmath0  is largely unknown a priori .",
    "this makes it difficult to estimate the extent to which the emission line flux has been absorbed , and in the case of ulas j1120 + 0641 , whether damping - wing absorption may be present .",
    "one approach to resolving this issue has been to estimate the intrinsic quasar spectrum near lyman-@xmath0  using either principal component analysis ( pca , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or composites made from lower - redshift objects ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the general approach is to find lower - redshift quasars whose spectra match the object of interest redward of lyman-@xmath0 .",
    "the spectra of the lower - redshift objects , which are less affected by lyman-@xmath0  forest absorption , can then be used to predict the unabsorbed continuum around the lyman-@xmath0  emission line and over the forest .",
    "this was the approach taken by recent studies of ulas j1120 + 0641 @xcite . in these cases",

    "the location of the composite quasar spectrum from @xcite is shown in light blue.,width=340 ]    the fidelity of a composite match will naturally depend on the availability of similar objects at lower redshifts .",
    "however , the c  iv line of quasars exhibits a source systematic velocity shift @xcite which is usually attributed to the presence of strong winds and jets associated with the quasar @xcite .",
    "in addition the equivalent width ( ew ) of the c  iv line is known to correlate with equivalent width of lyman-@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite match ulas j1120 + 0641 by selecting objects based on their c  iv ew and blueshift , but acknowledge that this is complicated by the fact that ulas j1120 + 0641 has a large c  iv blueshift and is matched by relatively few lower - z objects .",
    "the sparsity of suitable objects is aggravated by the need to restrict the selection to objects within the narrow redshift range 2.3 @xmath10 z @xmath102.6 chosen to minimize the impact of lyman-@xmath0  forest absorption .",
    "a compromise thus had to be made in order to obtain a large enough sample of objects , resulting in a small misalignment in c  iv blueshift between the composite and ulas j1120 + 0641 s spectrum . in this paper",
    "we examine whether the difference in blueshift , although small , might be having an unanticipated effect on the predicted strength of the lyman-@xmath0  emission line .",
    "we aim to predict the strength of the lyman-@xmath0  emission line without making use of a composite spectrum .",

    "one sample is designed to contain objects similar to ulas j1120 + 0641 in c  iv properties , except with a small blueshift mismatch ; the objects in the second sample are chosen to display no such offset .",

    "1 shows the resulting c  iv emission parameter space for 7025 sdss quasars over @xmath30 for which spectra with @xcite c  iii ] redshifts were available .",
    "as noted by @xcite , the ulas j1120 + 0641 c  iv emission line appears to be highly blueshifted compared to the general population of quasars .",
    "this makes it fall at the edge of the usual distribution of civ parameters .",
    "we proceeded to select one sample of objects located close to ulas j1120 + 0641 in c  iv parameter space , and another sample with the c  iv blueshift offset from the nominal value by @xmath33   ( @xmath3600 kms@xmath29 ) .",
    "this offset is chosen to mimic the apparent offset in c  iv between the ulas j1120 + 0641 spectrum and the composite fit of @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "the cuts we used are shown in table 1 .",
    "a cut of snr @xmath65 per pixel , measured by making use of the associated sdss error arrays over the wavelength range 1450 - 1500  , was also applied in the interest of measurement accuracy . for comparison",
    "the gnirs spectrum of ulas j1120 + 0641 has @xmath3114 per velocity bin over the same range .",
    "this initial cut yielded unrefined samples consisting of 204 c  iv - matched quasars and 709 offset quasars .",
    "due to the large uncertainties in the values of ew and blueshift for the objects in our sample , we expected the initial cuts to be inefficient at finding all of , and only , excellent matches for ulas j1120 + 0641 s c  iv emission .",
    "for this reason the initial selection boxes are large and a second , manual cut was necessary to refine the selection .",
    "next , each object s c  iv emission line was overlayed with ulas",
    "j1120 + 0641 s c  iv emission line and similarity was evaluated visually .",
    "objects which displayed too much or too little line asymmetry , as well as those whose c  iv emission peak was visually offset from ulas j1120 + 0641 s corresponding value , were rejected and excluded from the sample .",
    "this yielded a refined sample of 111 objects which closely matched ulas j1120 + 0641 s c  iv emission .",
    "the same process was repeated for the c  iv - offset sample , yielding a refined sample of 216 objects with a c  iv blueshift offset .",
    "the mean redshifts for the matched and offset selections were z=2.877 and z=2.912 respectively while the median values were z=2.898 and z=2.937 respectively .",
    "a two - sided ks test revealed no evidence that the two samples had been drawn from different distributions ( p@xmath20.10 ) .",
    "measuring the intrinsic lyman-@xmath0  flux is particularly difficult for our samples since they include quasars with redshifts as high as z=4 , for which lyman-@xmath0  forest absorption is a greater issue .",
    "this is further complicated by the complex shape of the lyman-@xmath0  emission line over this range , which includes contributions from asymmetric lyman-@xmath0  emission as well as nv . for these reasons the mean unabsorbed continuum in each object was estimated over the range 1216 - 1220  , which was chosen to maximize our sensitivity to the lyman-@xmath0  emission strength , while minimizing the impact of lyman-@xmath0  forest absorption . even in this wavelength range , however , lyman-@xmath0  and metal absorption lines can potentially obscure the intrinsic continuum , particularly at higher redshifts .",
    "we therefore inspect each object visually and estimate the continuum by eye , accounting for absorption lines to the extend possible .",
    "this will naturally be an imperfect process ; however , the errors in the continuum estimate arising from absorption lines are expected to impact both samples equally . to mitigate any bias caused by manual measurement",

    "the flux of each object was normalised by measuring the mean flux over the wavelength range 1450 - 1500   and the continuum emission was modeled by a power - law fitted iteratively over narrow , emission line free regions of the spectrum .",
    "these fitting windows spanned the rest wavelength ranges 1320 to 1350  , 1435 to 1480   and 1600 to 1700  .",
    "the range 2000 - 2050   was used in addition for z@xmath323 objects for which those wavelengths were present in the rest frame .",
    "the peak flux over c  iv was measured by the same method for all objects as well as ulas j1120 + 0641 to check that the c  iv emission was well matched by our selections and to ensure that direct comparison with the flux value over the lyman-@xmath0  red wing was meaningful .",
    "among the objects which matched the c  iv emission in shape and ew but which were offset in blueshift by @xmath3 600 kms@xmath29 , only three per cent of objects showed lyman-@xmath0  emission weaker than ulas j1120 + 0641 over the same range ( fig .",
    "this is consistent with the assessment by @xcite that ulas j1120 + 0641 is a @xmath32@xmath33 outlier from the composite they used .",
    "in contrast , among the selection which matched ulas j1120 + 0641 in c  iv emission , we find that 31 per cent have lyman-@xmath0  emission over the red wing weaker in magnitude than ulas j1120 + 0641 ( fig .",
    "4 ) . in addition",
    "our c  iv measurements are shown to demonstrate no residual correlation in these small samples ( r@xmath34 , r@xmath35 ) , demonstrating that the c  iv emission line of ulas j1120 + 0641 is typical among these samples .",
    "we therefore find no compelling evidence that the lyman-@xmath0  flux of ulas j1120 + 0641 is anomalously low .",
    "small sample size , low snr and scatter mean that our sample might not be suitable for making an appropriate composite fit to ulas j1120 + 0641 , and such",
    "an analysis is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "5 presents the average spectrum for both our selections ; those were made by interpolating the spectra onto a common wavelength array and taking the mean value pixel - by - pixel .",
    "the spectra were power - law corrected and normalised but absorption was not addressed .",
    "confirm the fact that a small mismatch in the c  iv emission line can have a significant effect on lyman-@xmath0  emission .",
    "although this effect is not large , it is sufficient to significantly impact the degree to which ulas j1120 + 0641 is an outlier .",
    "the amount by which the average spectra differ in c  iv blueshift is similar to the mismatch between ulas j1120 + 0641 and its composite fit as published in @xcite , condoning our use of the value of a @xmath3 600 kms@xmath29 c  iv blueshift mismatch .",
    "example objects matching ulas j1120 + 0641 s spectrum extremely well over its entire continuum and down to the onset of the lyman-@xmath0  forest at 1216  are shown in fig .",
    "6 along with their respective redshifts . using the strength of flux right of 1216  in a manner similar to ulas j1120 + 0641",
    ", one would thus falsely infer the presence of a damping wing in those objects .",
    "a large variety of lyman-@xmath0  peak shapes exists among the objects which match ulas j1120 + 0641 s c  iv line ; in particular the n  v emission line at 1240  overlaps with lyman-@xmath0  in a non - trivial way especially when the latter is weak .",
    "we make no attempt to constrain the n  v emission . the majority of objects in our sample display a visible si  ii emission line at 1260 , suggesting that the high - ionization lines c  iv , n  v and lyman-@xmath0  are blueshifted together while low - ionization lines si  ii , oi , cii are not .",
    "our findings are in agreement with richards et al .",
    "( 2011 ) who identify a link between a large nv / lyman-@xmath0  ratio in quasars with extreme c  iv blueshifts as well as a possible c  iv blueshift / lyman-@xmath0  blueshift correlation .",
    "this effect also helps to resolve the apparent mismatch of n  v in the @xcite composite .",
    "composites quasar spectra have been used in the past to study the igm around ulas j1120 + 0641 and hypothesize a large fraction of neutral gas or very metal - poor gas .",
    "those claims were based on ulas j1120 + 0641 s seemingly highly - absorbed lyman-@xmath0  emission ( @xcite using the quasar composite technique from @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however those authors acknowledge the difficulty of producing a composite fit to ulas j1120 + 0641 , due primarily to the rarity of suitable objects . as a result",
    ", composite fits have mismatched its c  iv emission line by @xmath3 600 kms@xmath29  or more in blueshift .",
    "@xcite suggested that this mismatch might have an impact on the existence of a lyman-@xmath0  damping wing .",
    "we have tested the effect of this small c  iv mismatch by selecting a sample of 111 sdss dr7 quasars at @xmath36 that more closely match ulas j1120 + 0641 s c  iv emission , and a second sample of 216 quasars whose c  iv emission lines match ulas j1120 + 0641 s in ew but are offset blueward by @xmath3600 kms@xmath29 ( @xmath33  in the rest frame ) .",
    "we find that among a population of quasars which match its c  iv emission in equivalent width and shape , but offset by @xmath3 600 kms@xmath29  from the correct c  iv line systematic blueshift , ulas j1120 + 0641 appears anomalous to a confidence of 97 per cent , in agreement with @xcite who find ulas j1120 + 0641 to be a 2@xmath33 outlier from their composite fit . when compared to a population of lower - redshift quasars which match its c  iv line emission , however , ulas j1120 + 0641 s lyman-@xmath0  flux anomalously weak .    in light of our results",
    "we suggest that the shape of the lyman-@xmath0  line in ulas j1120 + 0641 is not obviously due to a damping wing . from the evolution of the lyman-@xmath0  emission fraction in galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
