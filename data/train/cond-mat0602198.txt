    "the relevance and context of a hydrodynamic description for granular gases remains a controversial topic . at sufficiently low density the origin of hydrodynamics can be studied from boltzmann kinetic theory .",
    "@xcite to obtain hydrodynamics from the boltzmann kinetic equation the essential assumption is the existence of a `` normal '' solution , defined to be one for which all space and time dependence occurs through the macroscopic hydrodynamic fields .",
    "@xcite this solution , together with the macroscopic balance equations , leads to a closed set of hydrodynamic equations for these fields .",
    "the chapman ",
    "enskog method provides a constructive means to obtain an approximation to such a solution for states whose spatial gradients are not too large . in this general context , the study of hydrodynamics for granular gases is the same as that for normal gases .",
    "the details of the chapman ",
    "enskog method have been carried out for a one granular component gas to obtain the navier  stokes order hydrodynamic equations , together with exact integral equations determining the transport coefficients occurring in these equations .",
    "@xcite these integral equations have been solved approximately using sonine polynomial expansions and compared to both direct monte carlo simulation of the boltzmann equation and molecular dynamics simulation of the gas .",
    "@xcite good agreement is obtained even for relatively strong degrees of dissipation .",
    "the results support the formal theoretical analysis and the claim that hydrodynamics is not limited to the quasi - elastic limit .",
    "the analysis for multicomponent granular gases is much more complicated than for a one component gas .",
    "most of the previous attempts @xcite were made for _ nearly _ elastic spheres where the equipartition of energy can be considered as an acceptable assumption .",
    "in addition , according to this level of approximation , the inelasticity is only accounted for by the presence of a sink term in the energy balance equation , so that the expressions for the transport coefficients are the same as those obtained for normal fluids .",
    "@xcite however , the failure of energy equipartition in multicomponent granular gases @xcite has been also confirmed by computer simulations @xcite and even observed in real experiments . @xcite",
    "although the possibility of nonequipartition was already pointed out many years ago , @xcite it has not been until recently that a systematic study of the effect of nonequipartition on transport has been carefuly analyzed . in this context , garz and",
    "dufty @xcite have carried out a derivation of the navier  stokes hydrodynamic equations for a binary mixture at low - density that accounts for nonequipartition of granular energy .",
    "these equations and associated transport coefficients provide a somewhat more stringent test of the analysis since the parameter space is much larger .",
    "there are now many more transport coefficients , given as functions of the three independent coefficients of restitution , size ratio , mass ratio , and composition . as in the one component case ,",
    "explicit expressions for the transport coefficients requires also to consider sonine polynomial expansions .",
    "the accuracy of this approach has been confirmed by comparison with monte carlo simulations of the boltzmann equation in the cases of the shear viscosity @xcite and the tracer diffusion @xcite coefficients .",
    "exceptions to this agreement are extreme mass or size ratios and strong dissipation , although these discrepancies between theory and simulation diminish as one considers more terms in the sonine polynomial approximation .",
    "@xcite    since the dependence of the shear viscosity coefficient on the parameters of the mixture ( masses , sizes , concentration , coefficients of restitution ) has been widely studied in a previous work , @xcite a primary objective here is to demonstrate the variation of the six transport coefficients associated with the mass and heat flux in this parameter space , using the same sonine polynomial approximation as was found applicable for the one component gas . to set the context for these quantitative results two qualitative and potentially confusing issues",
    "are briefly noted at the outset .    there is some ambiguity regarding the hydrodynamic temperature in a mixture since",
    "temperatures for each species can be defined in addition to the global temperature . what should be the hydrodynamic fields ? for normal gases",
    "the answer is clear .",
    "these are set by the slow variables ( at large space and time scales ) associated with conserved quantities .",
    "in addition to species number and momentum , only the total kinetic energy is conserved , so only one global temperature occurs as a hydrodynamic field .",
    "the energy is no longer conserved for granular gases , but it remains a slow variable if the cooling rate is not too large .",
    "thus , in this case as well , only the global temperature should appear among the hydrodynamic fields .",
    "nevertheless , the species temperatures play a new and interesting secondary role . for a normal gas",
    ", there is a rapid velocity relaxation in each fluid cell to a local equilibrium state on the time scale of a few collisions .",
    "subsequently , the equilibration among cells occurs via the hydrodynamic equations . in each cell",
    "the species velocity distributions are characterized by the species temperatures .",
    "these are approximately the same due to equipartition , and the hydrodynamic relaxation occurs for the single common temperature .",
    "@xcite a similar rapid velocity relaxation occurs for granular gases in each small cell , but to a universal state different from local equilibrium and one for which equipartition no longer occurs .",
    "hence , the species temperatures @xmath0 are different from each other and from the overall temperature @xmath1 of the cell .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , the time dependence of all temperatures is the same in this and subsequent states , @xmath2 .",
    "this implies that the species temperatures do not provide any new dynamical degree of freedom .",
    "they still characterize the shape of the partial velocity distributions and affect the quantitative averages calculated with these distributions .",
    "the transport coefficients for granular mixtures therefore have new quantitative effects arising from the time independent temperature ratio @xmath3 for each species .",
    "@xcite this dependence is illustrated here as well .    in some earlier works , @xcite additional equations for each species temperature",
    "have been included among the hydrodynamic set .",
    "this is possible since the overall temperature is determined from these by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the concentration of species @xmath6 .",
    "however , this is an unnecessary complication , describing additional kinetics beyond hydrodynamics that is relevant only on the time scale of a few collisions .",
    "as described above ( and supported by molecular dynamics simulations @xcite ) the dynamics of all temperatures quickly reduces to that of @xmath7 .",
    "the remaining time independent determination of the @xmath3 follows directly from the condition that the cooling rates of all temperatures be the same .",
    "a second confusing issue is the context of the navier ",
    "stokes equations considered here .",
    "the derivation of the navier  stokes order transport coefficients does not limit their application to weak inelasticity .",
    "for this reason the results reported below include a domain of both weak and strong inelasticity , @xmath8 .",
    "the navier  stokes hydrodynamic equations themselves may or may not be limited with respect to inelasticity , depending on the particular states considered .",
    "the derivation of these equations by the chapman  enskog method assumes that relative changes in the hydrodynamic fields over distances of the order of a mean free path are small . for normal gases",
    "this can be controlled by the initial or boundary conditions .",
    "it is more complicated for granular gases . in some cases ( e.g. , steady states such as the simple shear flow problem @xcite )",
    "the boundary conditions imply a relationship between the coefficient of restitution and some hydrodynamic gradient  the two can not be chosen independently .",
    "consequently , there are examples for which the navier  stokes approximation is never valid or is restricted to the quasi - elastic limit .",
    "@xcite however , the transport coefficients characterizing the navier  stokes order hydrodynamic equations are well - defined functions of @xmath9 , regardless of the applicability of those equations ( e.g. , the coefficients of a taylor series for some function @xmath10 in powers of @xmath11 may be defined for all @xmath9 at each order , even when the series can not be truncated at that order ) .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "first , in sec .  [ sec2 ] the hydrodynamic equations and associated fluxes to navier  stokes order are recalled , and the expressions for the transport coefficients for heat and mass transport are given to leading sonine polynomial approximation .",
    "the elastic limit is discussed to aid in the interpretation of these expressions .",
    "next , in sec.[sec3 ] the results for these six coefficients are illustrated for a common coefficient of restitution and same size ratio as functions of @xmath12 at a composition @xmath13 for several values of the mass ratio . with the exception of thermal conductivity , the deviations from normal gas values are largest at small @xmath12 and large mass ratio .",
    "the usual onsager relations among these coefficients for normal gases is then noted and tested for the granular gas in sec .",
    "since the underlying basis for these relations ( time reversal symmetry ) no longer holds for granular systems , the expected violation is demonstrated as a function of @xmath12 for the same conditions .",
    "the stability of a special homogeneous solution to the mixture hydrodynamic equations is then studied , and some comments on the implications of the instability found are offered .",
    "finally , the results are summarized and discussed in the last section .",
    "we consider a binary mixture of _ inelastic _ , smooth , hard spheres of masses @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and diameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the inelasticity of collisions among all pairs is characterized by three independent constant coefficients of normal restitution @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the coefficient of restitution for collisions between particles of species @xmath6 and @xmath22 .",
    "it is assumed that the density of each species is sufficiently low that their velocity distribution functions are accurately described by the coupled set of _ inelastic _ boltzmann kinetic equations .",
    "the precise form of these equations is given in ref .   and will not be required here .",

    "for the two component mixture considered here there are six independent fields , @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 . to obtain a closed set of hydrodynamic equations ,",
    "expressions for @xmath39 , @xmath32 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 must be given in terms of these fields .",

    "@xmath43 @xmath37 @xmath38 , where @xmath44 is the composition of species @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is the hydrostatic pressure .",

    "this solution provides explicit expressions for the transport coefficients in terms of the coefficients of restitution and the parameters of the mixture ( masses , sizes , and composition ) .",
    "the above expressions for mass and heat fluxes can be defined in a variety of equivalent ways depending on the choice of driving forces used . for systems with elastic collisions ,",
    "the specific set of gradients contributing to each flux is restricted by fluid symmetry , onsager s relations ( time reversal invariance ) , and the form of entropy production .",
    "@xcite in this case , one usual representation leads to the mass and heat fluxes proportional to @xmath56 and @xmath57 , where @xmath58 ( defined below ) is the chemical potential per unit mass .",
    "however , for _ inelastic _ systems only fluid symmetry holds and so there is more flexibility in representing the fluxes and identifying the corresponding transport coefficients . in particular , a third contribution proportional to @xmath59 appears in both fluxes .",
    "some care is required in comparing transport coefficients in different representations using different independent gradients for the driving forces .    the cooling rate to lowest order in the gradients is @xmath60 .",

    "@xcite this confirms the relevant known limiting cases for the granular mixture results described here .",
    "the transport coefficients depend on many parameters : @xmath135 .",
    "this complexity exists in the elastic limit as well , so the primary new feature is the dependence on the coefficients of restitution @xmath136 being different from unity . to illustrate the differences between granular and normal gases the transport coefficients are normalized to their values in the elastic limit .",
    "then , the dependence on the overall temperature scales out .",
    "also , only the simplest case of a common coefficient of restitution ( @xmath137 ) and common size @xmath138 is considered .",
    "this reduces the parameter set to three quantities : @xmath139 .    in figs .",
    "[ fig1][fig6 ] , we plot the above transport coefficients as functions of the coefficient of restitution @xmath12 for @xmath13 , and several values of the mass ratio @xmath140 .",

    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the mutual diffusion coefficient as a function of @xmath143 for three mass ratios @xmath144 and @xmath145 . there is a monotonic increase of the coefficient with decreasing @xmath12 in all cases .",
    "moreover , that effect increases as the mass of the dilute species increases .",
    "this is consistent with an observed singular behavior in the extreme case of tracer diffusion for a massive particle .",
    "@xcite the velocity distributions in a granular gas are no longer maxwellian , @xcite and the difference is measured by the coefficients @xmath146 that appear in the expressions for the transport coefficients .",
    "@xcite the dashed curves in fig.[fig1 ] correspond to @xmath147 , the maxwell limit . in this case",
    "it is seen that the distortion of the maxwellian is not very important for this transport coefficient ( see however , discussion of fig .  [ fig4 ] below ) .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows that the pressure diffusion coefficient has a very similar behavior .",
    "the thermal diffusion coefficient vanishes in the elastic limit and remains small and slightly negative when the dilute species has small mass ratio , as illustrated in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "however as the mass ratio becomes large it becomes large and positive for strong dissipation .",
    "the effect of different species temperatures is also shown on this graph .",
    "the dashed curves correspond to setting @xmath148 .",
    "this is seen to yield large errors , particularly in the case of large mass ratio ( temperature differences are greater for mechanically different particles ) , indicating the real quantitative effect of two different species temperatures in granular gases .",
    "the thermal conductivity is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , with the same monotonic increase with increasing dissipation .",
    "the dashed lines ( @xmath149 ) indicate a significant effect of the distortion of the reference distribution function from its maxwellian form . presumably , this is due to the fact that the thermal conductivity @xmath150 depends on a higher velocity moment than the mutual diffusion coefficient @xmath67 and is more sensitive to the larger distortions at higher velocities .",
    "we also observe that there is little mass dependence when the dilute species is lighter .",
    "however , when the dilute species is more massive there is a significant decrease in the thermal conductivity , opposite to the case of diffusion .",
    "in contrast , the dufour coefficient does have a dependence on the mass ratio more like diffusion ( fig.[fig5 ] ) . finally , the coefficient @xmath151 is illustrated in figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "again there is weak dependence on the mass ratio until it becomes larger for the dilute species .    in summary ,",
    "the mass and heat flux transport coefficients for a granular mixture differ significantly from those for a normal gas mixture even at moderate dissipation . in most cases",
    "( thermal conductivity is an exception ) the differences increase with decreasing @xmath12 , depend weakly on the mass ratio when the dilute species ( @xmath152 ) is lighter than the excess species ( @xmath153 ) but increase significantly in the opposite case ( @xmath154 ) .",

    "the integral equations determining the transport coefficients have been solved by truncated expansions in sonine polynomials .",
    "this is expected to fail at extreme values of size or mass ratio , @xcite but the results are quite accurate otherwise .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations are the same as for a normal gas , except for a sink in the energy equation due to granular cooling , and additional transport coefficients in the mass and heat flux constitutive equations .",

    "for a normal gas the species temperatures rapidly approach the global temperature due to equipartition . for the granular gas",
