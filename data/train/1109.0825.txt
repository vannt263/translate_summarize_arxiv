    "sandpile model ( @xmath0 ) was introduced by bak , tang and weisenfeld @xcite as a paradigm to describe the self - organized criticality ( soc ) phenomenon in physics and has a variety of applications in physics , mathematics , economics , theoretical computer science @xcite .",
    "the simplest @xmath0 model is that the system starts from a single column configuration @xmath1 , then at each step , one column gives one grain to its right neighbor if it has more than at least two grains comparing to its right neighbor .",
    "it was proved @xcite that this model converges to only one configuration at which the evolution rule can not be applied at any column ( this configuration is called _ fixed point _ ) .",
    "furthermore , all _ reachable configurations _",
    "( which are obtained from the initial configuration @xmath1 by applying several times of the evolution rule ) are also well characterized and its configuration space is a lattice .",
    "the system @xmath0 has been modified and generalized in several aspects to satisfy each particular purpose . in the context of chip firing games , cellular automata and informatics systems , the @xmath0 model with parallel update scheme ( _ i.e. _ at each step",
    ", all applicable rules are applied in parallel ) received great attention @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", durand - lose showed that the transient time to reach a fixed point is linear in the total number of grains @xmath2 when the parallel updated scheme is used , whereas it is @xmath3 when the sequential one is used .    to make it closer to the real physical phenomenon , formenti _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and phan  @xcite , generalized @xmath0 so that grains are allowed to fall on both sides ( left and right ) .",
    "this generalized model is called _ symmetric sandpile model _ and denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "the model has no unique fixed point any more . while formenti _",
    "_ investigated the model by considering its configurations without caring its positions ( that is , they identify all configurations which are up - to a translation on a line ) , phan investigated the model in addition to its positions and showed the furthest position ( comparing to the position at which the initial column is situated ) .",
    "the authors characterized reachable configurations in  @xcite ( resp .",
    "forms of reachable configurations in  @xcite ) starting from a single column configuration . furthermore , they showed that the number of fixed - point forms of the model is exactly @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "in this paper , we study the @xmath4 model using a parallel update scheme . we denote this by @xmath6 for further ease of reference .",
    "we stress that unlike @xmath0 and @xmath7 , @xmath4 and @xmath6 can have multiple fixed points when starting from a given initial configuration ( as usual , we only consider single column configurations ) .",
    "it is also remarkable that in @xmath7 it is difficult to characterize all reachable configurations and so it is the same result in @xmath6 . in this paper , we concentrate on fixed points of the parallel scheme @xmath6 .",
    "it is straightforward that the set of fixed points of @xmath6 is contained in the set of fixed points of @xmath4 .",
    "we show as main result in this paper that although this containment is proper in general , the containment of their forms of fixed points is an equality .",
    "therefore , we can obtain all forms of fixed points of the sequential model by using the parallel update scheme with less than time .",
    "the proof is long and involved , and it has been divided into several subparts for better understanding .",
    "indeed , the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section 2 represents definitions and results about the characterizations of reachable configurations as well as the time of convergence for the three models : @xmath0 , @xmath7 and @xmath4 .",

    "first , we give a precise definition of @xmath6 .",
    "then , we introduce three procedures which are the building blocks for the proof of the main result ( theorem [ t : psspm1 ] ) .",
    "finally , in section 4 we draw the conclusion and present some perspectives for future research on the subject .",
    "in this section , we first give some basic definitions related to integer partitions and unimodal sequences . then we represent the results of the sandpile model ( @xmath0 ) and two generalizations ( @xmath7 and @xmath4 ) investigated in @xcite .",

    "now given a fixed - point form @xmath187 of @xmath4 , we put @xmath188 and @xmath189 we call @xmath190 the _ symmetric difference _ of @xmath59 .",

    "l : alp1]it is possible to implement @xmath227 steps of alternating procedure on @xmath234 .    on the contrary",
    "we assume that @xmath75 is the first step at which this does not hold and @xmath235 . by lemma [ l : atom1 ] and the definition of alternating procedure",
    ", we have the following facts @xmath236 for all @xmath237 . put @xmath238 .",
    "since we can not implement the alternating procedure on @xmath239 at the step @xmath75 , we must have @xmath240 and @xmath241 combining with the hypothesis of the contrary @xmath242 , we deduce for both cases that @xmath243 hence , either @xmath244 or @xmath245 .",
    "on the other hand , we have @xmath246 and @xmath247 , so that @xmath248 is even .",
    "thereby , @xmath244 if @xmath75 is even and @xmath245 if @xmath75 is odd .",
    "we consider these two cases _ case 1 .",
    "_ @xmath75 is even .",
    "we have @xmath249 and @xmath250 since there is no grain added on the left of @xmath251 at the step @xmath129 , we get @xmath252 it is remarkable that in the alternating procedure , the strict left and the strict right by @xmath64 sequentially fulfill the stairs before creating the new stairs of greater length .",
    "so that as from the step @xmath253 the strict left part is at least the stair @xmath254 .",
    "this is also true for the strict right part by @xmath64 since its weight is more than that of the strict left part .",
    "so during the evolutions of applying the transitions arbitrarily by the @xmath6 rule on @xmath23 , the column @xmath64 of @xmath23 never collapses again .",
    "therefore , at the end of these evolutions , we get fixed points having the same height @xmath255",
    ". we will show this is a contradiction .",
    "we assume that @xmath256 is a such fixed point .",
    "then @xmath257 and by theorem [ t : fmp1 ] , @xmath59 and @xmath256 are of representation as follows @xmath258 and @xmath259 since @xmath260 and @xmath261 , it implies that @xmath262 and @xmath263 . so that @xmath264 and @xmath59 contains at least 3 different plateaus of 4 following plateaus : @xmath265 of height @xmath266 , @xmath267 of height @xmath74 , @xmath268 of height @xmath74 and @xmath269 of height @xmath270 ( and @xmath271 ) .",
    "this contradicts the condition that @xmath59 is the form of a fixed point of @xmath272 .",
    "_ @xmath75 is odd .",
    "we have @xmath273 since there is no grain added on the right of @xmath274 at step @xmath129 , we have @xmath275 therefore , @xmath276 and @xmath277 this contradicts the condition that @xmath59 is one fixed point of @xmath44 and of height @xmath74 ( since @xmath278 corresponds to the configuration @xmath279 ) .    in summary",
    ", we conclude that starting from @xmath1 we can implement the pseudo - alternating procedure in @xmath223 steps then the alternating procedure in @xmath280 steps . as a result",
    "we obtain the unimodal sequence whose all columns are of height less than or equal to @xmath74 .",
    "[ l : fin]the procedure applying the transitions by @xmath6 rule on the configuration obtained after the processes @xmath281 and @xmath282 above is deterministic .",
    "moreover , it converges to @xmath59 .",
    "this is straightforward from the fact that all columns of the configuration obtained after two above processes are of the height less than @xmath74 .",
    "furthermore , the column @xmath64 of the configurations in the procedure is always of the height @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , there is no any columns collapsible on both sides and the procedure is deterministic . on the other hand , the left side part and the right side part by @xmath64",
    "evolve independently by @xmath40 ( so it is deterministic ) to reach their unique fixed points .",
    "the difference of two these parts always is @xmath71 .",
    "so at the end of the procedure we get @xmath59 .",
    "the three above lemmas have ended our proof of the theorem .",
    "figure [ wayfixed ] shows one way to obtain the fixed point @xmath283 ( of form @xmath284 ) from the single column configuration of @xmath285 grains .",
    "the dashed zone illustrates @xmath47 steps of pseudo - alternating procedure to obtain the @xmath286 ( which is @xmath287 ) .",
    "the dotted zone illustrates @xmath288 next steps of alternating procedure to obtain the configuration of height @xmath47 at column @xmath64 ( equal to the height of the given fixed point ) .",
    "last , it needs to apply @xmath289 steps of @xmath6 rule when there is no column collapsible on both sides to obtain the final fixed point .",
    "we also remarkable that the evaluations of inequalities in lemmas [ l : alt1 ] , [ l : alt2],[l : pse1 ] and specially lemma [ l : alp1 ] are very sensible .",
    "furthermore , our procedures we constructed above are not commutative each other in general , especially when the center column has not enough grains to distribute to its neighbors .",
    "so this may be easy to lead to another fixed - point form of @xmath4 not the one we expect .",
    "for instance , for the form @xmath290 we have @xmath291 and if we start from @xmath292 and implement the way shown in proof of theorem [ t : psspm1 ] then we get exactly @xmath59 .",
    "but if we first do the alternating procedure in @xmath47 steps ( which is equal to @xmath280 ) and next do the pseudo - alternating procedure , then we are able to implement this procedure only in @xmath289 steps not @xmath47 steps ( which is equal to @xmath223 ) . hence , we final get the form @xmath293 which is not @xmath294 .     to obtain the fixed point @xmath283 from @xmath295,width=453,height=151 ]    last",
    "we give a upper bounded for the shortest length of the ways to reach a fixed point in @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath296 be the shortest length to reach a fixed point in @xmath60",

    "hence , @xmath299 . from the way we constructed above",
    ", it takes @xmath225 transitions of applying pseudo - alternating procedure and alternating procedure ; then it takes at most @xmath74 transitions of applying the final procedure to reach a fixed point of @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , @xmath300 .",
    "we proved that beginning with a singleton column of sand grains , the sequential model and the parallel model produce the same fixed - point forms . to tackle the problem , for each fixed - point form of @xmath4",
    ", we construct an explicit way of @xmath6 evolution to obtain this fixed - point form . every configuration in this way",
    "has a `` smooth '' form , even it can be characterized by a formula on the time of the evolution , whereas it is difficult to capture the forms of general reachable configurations .    actually , the problem of finding a shortest way to reach a given fixed - point form of @xmath4 is interesting to explore . the way we constructed is not always a shortest way although it reveals many interesting properties to be possibly a shortest way .",

    "the fixed points of @xmath6 are not the same as those of @xmath4 .",
    "all the fixed points of @xmath6 might be fully characterized by the furthest fixed points ( the maximum and minimum fixed points with respect to the lexicographic order ) . a possible way to obtain the right - furthest fixed point",
    "is that at a current configuration , each column always collapses on the right if it is possible . by doing the experiments on computer ,",
    "it is surprising that when @xmath301 for some @xmath302 , the furthest fixed point has a nice pyramid - shape which has no plateau and the right - most grain is at distance @xmath303 .",
