    "a proper understanding of the solar surface convection has impact on many different areas of astrophysics .",
    "for example , ( a ) the solar metallicity is used as a universal reference , and it has been recently modified by fifty percent after considering realistic convective motions in the analysis @xcite , and ( b ) turbulent dynamo action can produce magnetic fields in many astrophysical environments ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , but its observational study is so far confined to the turbulent dynamo driven by the solar convective motions ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we have discovered small whirlpools in the sun , with a size similar to the terrestrial hurricanes .",
    "this discovery confirms a specific prediction of the current theory of solar convection that had remained elusive so far .",
    "the energy produced in the solar interior is transported to the surface firstly by radiation exchange and , during the last thirty percent of the way , by convective motions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the hot buoyant plasma rises , releases energy , and then falls down . according to the current theory , these convective motions are driven by strong highly localized downdrafts at the solar surface @xcite . the downdrafts are sinks where the cold plasma returns to the solar interior .",
    "since the matter has angular momentum with respect to the draining point , it must spin up when approaching the sink , giving rise to a whirl flow ( _ bathtub effect _ ) .",
    "although the vortex motions predicted by the theory have been repeatedly sought , they had not been found so far @xcite .",
    "( the exception in @xcite represents the same phenomenon at much larger scale . )",
    "we have detected these vortexes as proper motions of magnetic bright points ( bps ) , which follow spiral paths in the way to be engulfed by a downdraft .",
    "the bps are easily blurred by seeing @xcite , thus the unique 90  km spatial resolution provided by the swedish solar telescope at la palma turned out to be necessary @xcite .",
    "magnetic bps are present almost everywhere on the sun , also in the quiet internetwork regions @xcite .",
    "precisely looking for properties of these quiet sun bps , we found out that some of them spiral when heading towards the supposed location of a sink , which is the result reported in this letter .",
    "we note that the vortical motion of photospheric magnetic concentrations may have significant impact on its own , e.g. , on the heating of the solar corona @xcite .",
    "previous searches for photospheric vortexes were often motivated by this interest @xcite .",
    "a quiet sun internetwork target was observed near solar disk center with the swedish solar telescope ( sst ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . during observation",
    "seeing was fluctuating with minutes of excellence ( september 29 , 2007 ; from 9:13:57 to 9:45:55 ut ) .",
    "we used 12 bit kodak mega plus ii 2048  @xmath3  2048 cameras , which render an image scale of 0.034  pix@xmath4 . the field - of - view ( fov )",
    "includes various supergranules .",
    "we observe simultaneously in the g - band ( a 10.8    wide filter centered at 4305.6   ) , in ca  h line - core , and in the continuum close to ca  h. the images were reconstructed with multi - frame blind deconvolution @xcite to produce movies whose snapshots have an angular resolution close to the diffraction limit of the sst at the working wavelength ( @xmath501 ) .",
    "each snapshot results from combining 125 images , rendering a mean cadence of one snapshot every 15  s. a destretching algorithm allows us to remove residual image distortion left by the restoration process , and a subsonic filter suppresses p - modes and residual jitter stemming from destreching @xcite .",
    "our analysis is focused on the g - band images , where bps are easily observed even in the quietest sun .",
    "the g - band movie often shows bps swirling around intergranular points where several dark lanes converge .",
    "these motions are reminiscent of the bathtub vortex flows predicted by numerical simulations of convection , and which are driven by the granulation downdrafts (   [ introduction ] ) .",
    "since we have no other information but the proper motions of the bps , we can not proceed without assuming that these proper motions trace true plasma motions .",
    "we can not think of any other physical mechanism able to generate these _ very special _ trajectories , but it must be clear that treating the proper motions as plasma motions is a working hypothesis .",
    "we will discuss statistical properties of the whirlpools in ",
    "[ statistics ] .",
    "this section is focused on a particularly well defined event whose snapshots are shown in fig.[snapshots ] .",
    "( see also the animation provided as on - line material . )",
    "up to eight different bps move under the influence of this whirlpool during the 5  min duration of the event .",
    "their trajectories are shown in fig .",
    "[ todo ] , where we use a different symbol for each trajectory , i.e. , the set of positions of a single bp as time goes on .",
    "the positions have been determined as the centroid of the bp in successive snapshots .",
    "the identification of each particular bp has been carried out by eye , playing back and forth the movie with the fov of the event .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ todo]a that the bps swirl around a quite stable central point .",
    "only two bps follow straight trajectories ( see fig .  [",
    "todo]b ) , but this path coincides with the position of one of the intergranular lanes that feeds the whirlpool , and which channels the bp motion ( see also the top row of fig .  [ snapshots ] ) .    if the analogy with a bathtub vortex holds for the observed whirlpools , then a passive tracer should approximately follow a logarithmic spiral when heading to the sinkhole , i.e. , @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 stand for the radius and azimuth in polar coordinates with the draining point as origin",
    ". the symbol @xmath9 corresponds to the azimuth at the arbitrary radius @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is a constant of motion given by the ratio between the azimuthal velocity @xmath12 and the radial velocity @xmath13 .",
    "the parameter @xmath14 controls the shape of the spiral , which becomes a straight line for @xmath14 equals zero , and a circle for @xmath15 .",
    "equation  ( [ bathtub ] ) follows from the conservation of mass and angular momentum in a non - viscous incompressible fluid moving in a bathtub vortex ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these conditions are only loosely met by the solar plasma , however , the observed motions match quite well this approximate behavior .",
    "using a non - linear least squares procedure , we have fitted the trajectories of the bps in fig .  [ todo]a .",
    "we assume the whirlpool to be the same for all of them , i.e. , all trajectories share a common origin and the same @xmath14 .",
    "each bp trajectory has its own starting point parameterized by @xmath8 at @xmath10 , i.e. , by @xmath9 .",
    "the fitting is fairly robust and independent of the initial conditions , providing , @xmath16 where the mean value corresponds to the fit in fig .",
    "[ todo]a ( the solid lines ) , and the error bar indicates the standard deviation among the inferred values when each one of the bp trajectories is excluded from the fit .",
    "the area of the swirling region turns out to be of the order of 0.5@xmath30.5  mm@xmath17 .",
    "the size of the sinkhole ( i.e. , of the hypothetical downdraft ) has to be smaller than the radius of curvature of the smallest trajectory , which corresponds to the one marked by triangles in fig .",
    "its radius of curvature is of the order of 100 km , i.e. , the downdraft seems to be spatially unresolved to sst observations .",
    "bp proper motion velocities span from one to four km  s@xmath4 and , with some noise , they tend to increase towards the sinkhole .    .",
    "detailled visual inspection of the g - band movie shows the whirlpool motion described above to be quite common . in order to have a statistically significant description of the phenomenon",
    ", we carried out a careful visual analysis of the full time series looking for swirl motions . roughly speaking ,",
    "one finds two types of motions that we have identified as vortexes : ( 1 ) two or more bps move ( in the same or in opposite directions ) towards a point , where they rotate with respect to one another , and ( 2 ) the rotation also includes the diffuse bright borders of the sometimes fragmented granules surrounding the turning point . taking this vague definition in mind , we find 138 swirls ( fig .",
    "[ meso - super ] ) , 83% of which belong to type  1 , and the rest to type  2 .",
    "( the motion shown in fig .",
    "[ snapshots ] belongs to the second type . )",
    "our fov covers 49.7mm@xmath349.7 mm .",
    "the time series lasts 31.5  min .",
    "this corresponds to an space - and - time density equals to @xmath18 vortex mm@xmath19min@xmath4 .",
    "the lifetimes of the vortexes were also estimated .",
    "the starting time was defined as the time where the bps begin their swirling motions .",
    "these motions often end up producing a central still bp .",
    "then we take the end time as the moment when this bp starts fading away or fragmenting . if the central bp is not formed , our final time is the time when circular motions are no longer distinguished .",
    "the mean lifetime of the 138 whirlpools turns out to be @xmath20min , with the error bar representing the standard deviation among all single measurements . assuming that the number of swirls is stationary , at any given time one finds @xmath21 whirlpools on the solar surface , which corresponds to 0.90@xmath1 vortex mm@xmath19 .",
    "the lifetime estimates are only lower limits to the true lifetimes , since the vortexes should exist and last even if there are no magnetic bps that allow us to detect them . for the same reason the number of detected vortexes also represents a lower limit .",
    "there is the same probability of clockwise and counterclockwise motions .",
    "we find 50.4% of the whirls with counterclockwise rotation , and 49.3% with clockwise rotation ( fig .",
    "[ meso - super ] ) .",
    "the observed swirls are not uniformly distributed throughout the fov .",
    "they follow a pattern that closely resembles supergranulation and mesogranulation cells ( fig .",
    "[ meso - super ] ) .",
    "it is not clear whether this distribution reveals an intrinsic property of the vortexes .",
    "rather , it seems to be a selection effect we impose when using g - band bps as passive tracers of plasma motions .",
    "it is well known that bps trace supergranulation @xcite and mesogranulation @xcite .",
    "vortexes outside these areas lack of enough bps and they will not be detected .",
    "observing these convectively driven vortex flows has been elusive because of the size of the whirlpools .",
    "motions take place at sub - arcsec scales and , therefore , close to the best angular resolution achieved at present . in addition , the case analyzed in ",
    "[ whirlpool ] seems to be extreme in the sense that the ratio between the azimuthal velocity and the radial velocity is particularly large ( @xmath22 ) , which renders closed spiral paths and clear swirling motions . assuming that the velocity of the plasma that feeds the whirlpools has an important stochastic component set by the complex granular dynamics",
    ", then one should expect the azimuthal and the radial velocities to be similar , rendering @xmath23 . in this case",
    "the swirling motions are moderate and so easy to overlook .",
    "the bp trajectories corresponding to these more typical cases are hard to distinguish from straight lines within the angular resolution of the observations ( see fig .",
    "[ twocases ] ) .",
    "( the solid line , corresponding to @xmath24 ) , and what we expect to be the most probable case , with @xmath23 ( the dashed line ) .",
    "the swirling motions of the latter are difficult to detect since the deviations from straight lines are of the order of the angular resolution of the observation ( represented by the hashed disk at the core of the whirlpool ) .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    our work should be complemented with a spectroscopic confirmation of the vortex motions .",
    "it requires observing the whirlpools out of the disk center so that the horizontal circular motions have a component along the line - of - sight ( los ) .",
    "such spectroscopic observation is challenging . achieving",
    "the required spatial resolution is even more difficult in spectroscopy .",
    "moreover , one would like to maximize the velocity component along the los by observing well outside the solar disk center .",
    "however , the solar surface is corrugated and , outside the disk center , the granules protrude hiding the intergranular lanes that harbor the vortexes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
