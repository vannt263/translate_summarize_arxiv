    "the star - forming blue - cloud galaxies tend to have late - type morphologies , while the quiescent systems populating the red sequence are predominantly early - type .",
    "the origin of this bimodality remains unclear and has become one of the major conundrums in the field of extragalactic astronomy .",
    "as the stellar mass contained within the red sequence has doubled since @xmath4 , contrary to that of the blue cloud , it is thought that blue galaxies can migrate to the red sequence once their star formation has quenched @xcite .",
    "while several mechanisms responsible for the star - formation quenching have been studied @xcite , the emerging consensus is that the transformation between star - forming and quiescent galaxies can occur through either a fast or a slow channel .",
    "the slow mode involves the secular evolution of galaxies , without the presence of external triggering mechanisms , where star - formation fades gradually as the gas supply is used up @xcite .",
    "this work s focus is on the fast route , supported by the scarcity of galaxies in the ` green valley ' , stretching between the blue cloud and the red sequence in the colour - magnitude diagrams .",
    "fast quenching is commonly associated with an escalated gas consumption during a merger - induced starburst , followed by removal of the remaining gas supply by subsequent stellar and/or agn feedback @xcite .",
    "however , a recent study of local galaxies with signatures of a past starburst by @xcite has shown that they preserve substantial gas reservoirs which can potentially fuel star formation for an extended period of time , making the ` fast ' nature of this quenching scenario debatable .",
    "further study of the possible quenching mechanisms is required , and galaxies that show signatures of a recent starburst ( post - starburst galaxies ) as well as those that have undergone a recent merger ( post - merger galaxies ) may provide a unique insight to this ` fast ' transition phase between the star - forming and the quiescent mode of galaxy evolution @xcite .",
    "post - starburst ( psb ) galaxies ( also known as ` k+a ' galaxies ) have spectra featuring unusually strong balmer lines in absorption - an attribute of a stars .",
    "such features are thought to be a signature of a recent ( @xmath5 gyr ) truncation following either a short burst @xcite or normal - mode star formation activity within a galaxy @xcite .",
    "distinguishing between the two events requires careful modelling , which shows that very strong balmer lines are inconsistent with anything other than a recent starburst @xcite .",
    "first discovered over 30 years ago @xcite , psb galaxies are found in various regions of the universe : locally , they are rare and populate mainly the field and poor groups @xcite but their incidence increases at higher redshifts , where they seem to lie predominantly in clusters ( e.g. @xcite but see @xcite for a contradictory conclusion ) . whether psb galaxies are a link between the star - forming and quiescent phases of galaxy evolution is still an ongoing debate . results of some studies support this claim : at @xmath6 , the mass flux through the psb phase is comparable to the mass growth of the red sequence @xcite , and quenched psb galaxies tend to be early - type @xcite . however , other studies suggest the opposite : the incidence of psb galaxies at @xmath6 is inconsistent with a major channel for the red sequence growth in clusters @xcite , and the remaining gas reservoirs up to @xmath7 billion years after the starburst suggest a non - quenched state for local psb galaxies @xcite . the contradictory conclusions of the different studies may partially come from their differing selection techniques used to identify psb signatures in galaxies , as well as the different environments and redshifts that each study focuses on",
    ". clearly further study of this interesting class of galaxies is warranted .",
    "the origin of psb signatures in galaxies has not yet been constrained .",
    "a possible mechanism , favoured by numerical simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) , is gas - rich major mergers , which can induce starbursts strong enough to rapidly consume a significant amount of the galaxy s gas reservoir @xcite , and can transform late - type galaxies into early types both structurally and kinematically @xcite .",
    "mergers of galaxies have been observed for over 50 years @xcite and their connection with psb spectral signatures in galaxies has been investigated in some previous studies but with no definite conclusion so far .",
    "the fact that many local psb galaxies lie in the field and poor groups suggests that they could be merger remnants @xcite , and the signs of morphological disturbance found in many psb galaxies provides strong evidence supporting this claim ( @xcite ) .",
    "nonetheless , results reported by some other studies suggest otherwise , for example : not all psb galaxies show signs of an interaction @xcite and the redshift - evolution of the psb number density found by @xcite is @xmath8 times that of the major - merger rate estimated by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite argue that the relative incidence of starburst , post - starburst , passive and star - forming galaxies found in five rich clusters suggests that less disruptive events , like minor mergers and accretion , are at play .",
    "the role of galaxy mergers in quenching of star - formation in galaxies is not well understood and it remains challenging to constrain due to the large variability of merger signatures and the resulting difficulties in defining robust sample selection criteria .",
    "common methods include selection of close pairs ( i.e. pre - merger stages , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) or probing visual merger signatures in galactic structure",
    ". the latter approach can be done by means of either visual inspection or quantitative approach involving , for example : rotational asymmetry ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) or the recently introduced median - filtering of high - resolution images for detection of double nuclei @xcite .",
    "such measures are useful for identifying galaxies in early stages of a merger , particularly prior to the coalescence of the galaxy nuclei but , they are less suitable for tracing low surface - brightness post - merger signatures .",
    "while visual classification offers great reliability and have recently been extended to large galaxy samples ( the galaxy zoo project , @xcite ; see @xcite for merger morphology ) , the need for a more efficient , automated selection of galaxies in post - coalescence stages of a merger increases in today s era of extensive surveys .",
    "an automated approach also provides a more quantitative and easily reproducable description of galaxy morphology than visual classification .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a new morphological indicator designed to probe the asymmetric structures in the outskirts of galaxies in the late stages of a merger . through comparison with visual classification of galaxy images",
    ", we show that the indicator performs remarkably well in detecting faint signatures of tidal disruption in starburst and post - starburst galaxies .",
    "we use the new measure to identify post - merger ( or , in few cases , ongoing - merger ) candidates in a sample of 335 local galaxies with bulges , with strongest starburst and post - starburst signatures in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) , selected using a sophisticated technique introduced by @xcite , and to investigate the evolution of the morphological disturbance in these galaxies as a function of the starburst age .",
    "we also use several standard measures found in literature to characterise the structure of galaxies evolving through the starburst and post - starburst phase and compare them with those characteristic of galaxies residing on the present - day red sequence .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : section 2 contains a description of samples and their selection criteria ; section 3 - the methodology ; section 4 - calibration and testing ; section 5 - the results ; section 6 - a discussion ; section 7 - the summary of conclusions .",
    "we adopt a cosmology with @xmath10 = 0.30 , @xmath11 = 0.70 and h@xmath12 = 70kms@xmath13mpc@xmath13 .",
    "the following samples of galaxies were selected from the sdss dr7 spectroscopic catalogue .",
    "the test sample consists of 70 local galaxies at @xmath14 with sdss petrosian magnitude within the range : @xmath15 .",
    "the sample was selected to represent systems with various degrees of morphological disturbance , which was determined based on visual inspection of the galaxy images . to find galaxies with disrupted morphologies , we pre - selected galaxies with spectroscopic starburst and post - starburst signatures , as further described in section [ sec : psb_sample ] .",
    "we then visually examined their images in @xmath16-band as well as the sdss false colour images for the presence of morphological disturbance and tidal features , pointing to a past ( and in a few cases , still ongoing ) merger event .",
    "the final sample of test galaxies ( figures [ fig : morphsample1 ] and [ fig : morphsample2 ] ) contains : galaxies with highly disrupted morphologies , tidal features indicating a past major merger ( images 1 - 20 ) ; galaxies with moderate morphological disturbance , with no prominent tidal features but slight deviations from regular appearance ( images 21 - 30 ) ; galaxies with no signs of morphological disturbance ( images 31 - 40 ) .",
    "the notable fraction of ongoing mergers in the sample is a consequence of the selection criteria chosen for purposes of the method testing .",
    "the test sample is not representative of the entire population of local psb galaxies .",
    "finally , we include in the test sample a control subset of 30 normal galaxies ( selected using the above constraints on redshift and magnitude ) classified as early- ( images 41 - 50 , 61 - 65 ) and late - types ( images 51 - 60 , 66 - 70 ) based on the sdss _ fracdev _ parameter with threshold values of 0.99 and 0.1 , respectively .",
    "the _ fracdev _",
    "parameter describes the fraction of the total galaxy light fit by the de vaucouleurs profile ( with the total light being represented by the model magnitude , computed from a linear combination of de vaucouleurs and exponential fits to galaxy light profiles ) .",
    "we split the normal galaxies based on their inclination , into face - on ( @xmath17 , images 41 - 60 ) and edge - on ( @xmath18 , images 61 - 70 ) subsets .      in this work",
    "we are interested in the whole sequence from starburst to quiescence , and wish to observe the decline in post - merger features that might be expected following the starburst event .",
    "we therefore select an evolutionary sample of galaxies at different stages of the starburst / post - starburst phase , which we collectively refer to as the ` ( post-)starburst ' or ` sb / psb ' sample .",
    "the sample consists of 400 local galaxies which have undergone a strong recent starburst selected from a parent sample of 70,000 galaxies with @xmath14 and spectral snr / pixel greater than 8 in the @xmath19-band , from the spectroscopic sdss dr7 catalog .",
    "the galaxies within the parent sample were selected to be bulge dominated , with stellar surface mass density @xmath20 3 @xmath2110@xmath22m@xmath23 kpc@xmath24 . with @xmath16 being the physical size in kpc of the radius which contains @xmath25 of the sdss @xmath26-band petrosian flux and the stellar mass measured from the 5-band sdss photometry ( j. brinchmann , http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/sdss ) ]",
    "this is similar to imposing a stellar mass limit of @xmath27m@xmath23 @xcite .",
    "our reason for using this sample is that it has already been studied in @xcite to measure a @xmath28 myr offset between starburst and accretion onto the central supermassive black hole , and in @xcite to investigate the evolution of their dust and gas contents .",
    "the disadvantage of this pre - selection on stellar mass surface density is that galaxies with bulges may undergo stronger starbursts due to gravitational effects , and therefore not be representative of the full merging galaxy population .",
    "we intend on extending our analysis to further samples in later work .",
    "figure [ fig : vivplot ] shows the distribution of two spectral indices that describe the shape of the spectrum ( 4000  break and balmer break strength ) and balmer absorption line strength for all 70,000 bulge - dominated galaxies .",
    "these spectral features constrain the recent star formation history of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the indices are computed within the spectral region @xmath29-@xmath30  using a principal component analysis ( pca ) , which identifies and groups together features that vary simultaneously as the balance of stars in a spectrum changes @xcite . by combining multiple balmer absorption lines together with information from the shape of the stellar continuum the pca provides a much higher signal - to - noise ratio spectral index to identify an excess of a stars compared to the traditionally used h@xmath31 or h@xmath32 absorption lines . in figure",
    "[ fig : vivplot ] , a large majority of the galaxies are found on the right side of the plot with strong 4000  break ( pc1 ) , characteristic of the quiescent red - sequence galaxies .",
    "lower values of pc1 point to ongoing star formation , therefore the less numerous blue - cloud galaxies appear on the left side of the plot .",
    "starburst galaxies undergo brief episodes of enhanced star formation which reflect in extremely low values of pc1 as well as pc2 ( deficit of balmer absorption and weak 4000  breaks ) , due to their stellar populations being dominated by short - lived o / b stars .",
    "as the dominant stellar populations within these galaxies change with time elapsed from the starburst event , the galaxy moves to the post - starburst phase , and the balmer absorption features will increase in strength relative to the 4000  break @xcite .",
    "the peak at highest pc2 values is where we find old post - starburst galaxies with dominant populations of a stars and starburst age ( @xmath33 ) @xmath34 1gyr .    to select an evolutionary sample of ( post-)starburst galaxies , we selected galaxies from the extreme left of the pc1/2 distribution .",
    "these have undergone the strongest recent starburst in the sample , and therefore exhibit the most extreme spectral features .",
    "the starburst ages of those galaxies were estimated using bayesian fitting of @xcite stellar population synthesis models to the spectral indices .",
    "first , starburst ages for all galaxies with pc1@xmath35 or pc2@xmath36 were estimated from the median of the posterior distribution , assuming a star formation history comprising an old stellar population and recent starburst . to identify a statistically complete sample of the strongest ( post-)starburst galaxies we selected galaxies with the lowest pc1 value , such that we have 20 galaxies per 30myr time interval , up to a starburst age of 600myr .",
    "the reason for this age restriction is that , at older ages , there is a degeneracy between starburst age and burst strength using pc1 and pc2 alone ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the final sample of 400 sb / psb galaxies are plotted in figure [ fig : vivplot ] , with starburst age coded by colour .",
    "the key difference between this selection method and those used in previous studies of post - starburst galaxies is that we select purely on stellar continuum features and do not remove galaxies with identifiable nebular emission lines .",
    "traditionally galaxies are removed from the post - starburst samples if either h@xmath37 or [ o@xmath38 is visible , thereby ensuring that star - formation has completely shut off .",
    "we did not do this for two key reasons : ( i ) the traditional method actively selects against galaxies that host narrow line agn , which are more prevalent in post - starburst galaxies than galaxies with other star - formation histories , resulting in incomplete samples @xcite ; ( ii ) the traditional method only selects old post - starburst galaxies , as starbursts themselves are not instantaneous , but rather have a decay time of @xmath39 gyr @xcite . for further details of the sample selection , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "prior to the analysis , the final sample was reduced to 335 galaxies .",
    "this was done after visual inspection of the galaxy images ( sdss @xmath16-band ) which revealed that in case of 65 galaxies , the presence of bright field stars in the images could contaminate the measurements of the structural parameters . as a result , those galaxies were discarded .",
    "this does not affect the statistical property of our sample as the discarded galaxies were distributed evenly throughout all starburst age bins .      in order to relate the structure and morphology of galaxies evolving through the sb / psb phase to that of both star - forming and passively evolving galaxies , we also selected control samples of 49 and 53 galaxies from the blue - cloud and red - sequence regions of the pc1-pc2 spectral index space , respectively .",
    "for that purpose , we used the same bulge - dominated base sample as during the selection of the sb / psb galaxies .",
    "the control samples contain random selections of galaxies from the regions centred on the most populated parts of the blue cloud and the red sequence ( marked by the blue / red box in figure [ fig : vivplot ] ) . to eliminate potential biases due to varying galaxy structure with the stellar mass within both the blue cloud and the red sequence",
    ", we ensured that the stellar mass distributions of the galaxies within our control samples match that of the oldest ( 0.5 gyr@xmath400.6 gyr ) sb / psb galaxies in our main galaxy sample .",
    "to characterise the structure of the galaxies we applied a range of automated structural measures to the sky - subtracted @xmath16-band images of the ( post-)starburst galaxies .",
    "we first defined a binary ` detection mask ' containing the pixels to be included in the structure measurements ( section [ sec : method_mask ] ) .",
    "then , we computed the standard measures of galaxy structure used in the literature ( section [ sec : method_oldparams ] ) as well a new measure of morphology introduced in this work , designed for detecting asymmetric morphological features characteristic of post - mergers ( section [ sec : method_ashape ] ) .          to create the binary detection mask we employed an 8-connected structure detection algorithm , with 8-connected neighbours defined as all pixels touching one of the edges or corners of the central pixel .",
    "the algorithm searches for such neighbouring pixels with intensities above a threshold level defined as a function of the background sky level and its standard deviation .",
    "the algorithm is specifically designed to identify faint features in the outskirts of galaxies . to enhance the detectability of such features without significantly lowering the detection threshold and potentially dropping to the noise level",
    ", we passed the images through a @xmath41 running average ( mean ) filter prior to the detection process .",
    "this reduced the noise in the images by not only amplifying the signal from the regions with low surface - brightness but also diminishing the pixellation effect in those regions where individual pixels are too faint to be detected .",
    "then , starting from the central pixel as given by the sdss position , the detection mask was built by accepting all pixels that are 8-connected to previously accepted pixels and have intensities above the chosen threshold .",
    "after some experimentation we found the optimal threshold for a robust detection of faint tidal features is 1 standard deviation above the sky background level .",
    "for the sdss @xmath16-band images of the sb / psb sample , this corresponds to a mean limiting surface brightness of 24.7 mag / arcsec@xmath42 . in figure [ fig : masksradii ] we show examples of detection masks computed for sb / psb galaxies with different levels of morphological disturbance , as classified by visual inspection of the sdss @xmath16-band images ( the exact criteria of the visual classification are explained in detail in section [ sec : resultspsb_visclass ] ) . in the case of ongoing mergers , with double nuclei joined by a bridge ( figure [ fig : morphsample1 ] , obj . 7 , 9 , 13 , 17 )",
    ", the detection mask will include both components of the merging system .",
    "the computation of the binary detection mask relies on a good estimate of the sky background level in the images . for a self - contained analysis",
    ", we estimated our own sky background levels rather than using sdss values , although we find the two measurements agree well .",
    "we extracted pixels lying within a circular annulus with inner and outer radius of 20 and 40 times the full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of the light profile of each galaxy .",
    "this resulted in a large enough area and inner boundary sufficiently far from the central source to ensure a representative measurement of the sky background level @xcite .",
    "we estimated the sky background level by the mode of the flux histogram , clipped iteratively at 3@xmath43 @xcite until convergence of the mode ( typically after a few iterations ) .",
    "we defined the mode as 2.5@xmath21median - 1.5@xmath21mean @xcite .    from the binary detection masks we estimated the galaxy radius , @xmath44 , as the distance between the centre ( brightest pixel within the mask ) and the most distant pixel from that centre .",
    "we find that this definition of galaxy radius is an improvement for our purposes over the commonly used petrosian radius , @xmath45 @xcite , in the case of galaxies with significant morphological disturbance . in the second row of figure",
    "[ fig : masksradii ] apertures at the new radii ( black ) are compared to those at twice the petrosian radii ( red ) .",
    "the latter value is typically used to recover the majority of flux for galaxies with regular morphologies @xcite .",
    "the radii are similar for morphologically undisturbed galaxies but in the presence of significant morphological disturbance , @xmath44 includes the extended faint structures in the outskirts of galaxies , which can be excluded by @xmath46 . finally , we recomputed the sky background level within a circular annulus with inner and outer radius of one and two times @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "this final estimate of the sky background level was subtracted from the images prior to the measurement of the morphological parameters ( although it differs from the original one by no more than 3 digital counts per pixel , we note a drop in the standard deviation by as much as 50@xmath47 ) .",

    "the threshold was chosen empirically based on the fact that all galaxies with regular morphologies in the test sample have @xmath103 while @xmath104 is found only for galaxies with some level of morphological disturbance ( detected by visual inspection ) .",
    "the situation is similar for @xmath62 and @xmath66 , ( with an exception of one elliptical galaxy having a slightly higher @xmath66 ) .",
    "we compare the performance of the three measures of asymmetry by considering this threshold .",
    "figure [ fig : a_morph ] shows that the shape asymmetry performs significantly better at separating galaxies with highest degree of morphological disturbance from those with regular appearance , than the other two asymmetry measures .",

    "visual inspection of the single galaxy omitted by @xmath67 revealed that the features present in the galaxy s structure form an azimuthally symmetric pattern , explaining the corresponding low value of @xmath67 .",
    "we note that the new measure also recognises @xmath108 of galaxies with lower level of morphological disturbance ( violet symbols ) , while both the standard asymmetry parameter and the outer asymmetry fail to pick out any such objects .",
    "the ability of @xmath67 to detect galaxies with asymmetric tidal features comes from the independence of the measure of the flux distribution within the galaxies .",
    "in contrast , both @xmath62 and @xmath66 are flux - weighted measurements and therefore can become dominated by the brightest regions within galaxies , especially in the case of the former , where significant contribution to the measurement can come from multiple bright nuclei found in galaxies in pre - coalescence stages of a merger .",
    "visual inspection identifies 4/7 ( @xmath109 ) such galaxies in the test sample and all of them have @xmath110 ( figure [ fig : a_morph ] ) . in the case of @xmath66 ,",
    "the contribution from multiple bright nuclei will not be as significant as in the case of @xmath62 , as the inner aperture containing the brightest @xmath25 of the total light is omitted .",
    "the parameter should therefore be more sensitive to the low - surface brightness regions than @xmath62 ; however , as we show in figure [ fig : a_morph ] , it fails to identify more than half of the galaxies with highly disrupted morphologies .",
    "we also investigate outer asymmetries computed by cutting out inner apertures containing as much as 80@xmath47 and 90@xmath47 of the total flux , however , we find no significant improvement over @xmath66 with the inner @xmath25 cut out .",
    "this may stem from the differences in the light profiles of galaxies : while for some objects cutting out the inner circular aperture containing 50@xmath47 of the total light may be optimal for separating its asymmetric outer features , it may prove insufficient or excessive for other galaxies .",
    "it is therefore not obvious how to define the inner circular aperture that would yield the most robust result .",
    "we also investigate an alternative approach to outer asymmetry by considering a central region with its geometry defined by the distribution of pixels accounting for a given fraction of the total galaxy light .",
    "however , we find that the irregularity of the inner region defined in such a way artificially increases the value of @xmath66 .",
    "we conclude that the shape asymmetry is a much better indicator of the presence of asymmetric tidal features in galaxies than any of the standard structural parameters considered in this work , including the standard asymmetry parameter , @xmath62 , and its modifications designed to measure the asymmetry of galaxy outskirts ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "we note that the shape asymmetry is purely a measure of galaxy morphology rather than structure . in order to gain information about the asymmetry of the light distribution within galaxies ,",
    "the computation of the standard asymmetry parameter is a more suitable approach .      as shown in the study by @xcite ,",
    "while normal galaxies tend to show strong 180@xmath111-symmetry , their projected shapes can introduce significant asymmetry under a @xmath112-rotation ( @xmath113 ) , which can serve as a good approximation for the directly measured minor - to - major axes ratio for statistical galaxy samples .",
    "in particular , galaxies seen ` face - on ' show @xmath114 , while those observed at higher inclination angles tend to reveal higher values , with @xmath113 reaching around 0.8 for the edge - on systems .",
    "we applied the concept of asymmetry under a 90@xmath111-rotation to the binary detection masks of galaxies within the test sample .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : a_morph ] , spiral and elliptical galaxies are separated in @xmath115 according to their axial ratio : galaxies with @xmath116 tend to show higher asymmetries under a @xmath112 rotation .",
    "we find that @xmath115 is roughly correlated with @xmath117 for the morphologically disturbed galaxies , however the large scatter is caused by the variety of shapes of the tidal features . within the test sample ,",
    "galaxies with elongated tail - like features tend to have both higher @xmath117 and @xmath115 , while those with shell - like features show lower @xmath115 .",
    "further tests of this aspect of the shape asymmetry will involve samples of galaxies with representative tidal features of different types ( e.g. @xcite ) , galaxies in earlier stages of a merger ( e.g. @xcite ) , as well as simulated galaxy mergers @xcite ) .",

    "as the binary detection masks are created by assembling connected pixels above a specific threshold , the measurement of @xmath67 will depend on the choice of that threshold .",
    "therefore , the limiting surface brightness of the images used to create the detection masks will be the measurement s main limitation .    for the sdss @xmath16-band images ,",

    "figure [ fig : test_detthresh ] shows example results of tests of the dependence of @xmath67 on the limiting surface brightness of the galaxy images by increasing the detection threshold . upon inspection of the resulting binary masks and the corresponding values of the shape asymmetry",
    "we find that , unsurprisingly , the behaviour of @xmath67 with limiting magnitude depends on the geometry of the features in the outskirts of the galaxies , as well as on their brightness relative to the central regions . for objects showing significant morphological disturbance ,",
    "@xmath67 changes substantially and in general follows a decreasing trend with decreasing @xmath119 ( i.e. with decreasing image depth ) .",
    "conversely , in the case of galaxies with regular morphologies , this effect is much less pronounced and the measurement of @xmath67 shows stability against varying @xmath119 .    to summarise",

    "the sdss data used in this study are sufficiently deep in surface brightness to reveal faint structures in the outskirts of galaxies ; however , using images of higher limiting magnitude could disclose further even fainter features in their morphology , consequently influencing their measured values of @xmath67 .",

    "the visual inspection was carried out independently by five reviewers and involved examining images of the sb / psb galaxies as well as an additional sample of 300 continuously star - forming galaxies .",
    "the star - forming galaxies were selected from the blue cloud , using the same spectral indices as the sb / psb galaxies and within the same redshift and stellar mass range ( in this case , blue - cloud galaxies were more appropriate than red - sequence , because , due to their star formation activity , they are more likely to show disturbance in their structure than galaxies in which the star formation has already quenched ) .",
    "all images were randomised prior to inspection . each galaxy",

    "the distribution of light within the ( post-)starburst galaxies shows a high level of inequality , as measured by the gini index , ( particularly for those with youngest starbursts ) , and this inequality decreases with the starburst age .",

    "the declining trend in @xmath143 means that the agreement between visual and automated classification weakens with the starburst age .",
    "the reason for this is twofold : 1 ) the visual classification was computed by combining individual classifications obtained by different reviewers and is therefore affected by the differences in opinions between them ; 2 ) the automated approach is designed to measure the degree of asymmetry of the tidal features present in galaxies , while the visual approach classifies galaxies according to the presence / absence of such features only .",
    "the second statement is supported by the declining trend in @xmath67 as a function of the starburst age for the morphologically disturbed ( post-)starburst galaxies ( figure [ fig : bulge_distundist]a ) .      in this section",

    "we find that at least @xmath1 of the youngest starburst galaxies in our sample show disturbed morphological features , and that this fraction decreases with the starburst age to about @xmath144 at @xmath140 gyr ( left panel , figure [ fig : visauto ] ) .",
    "this latter fraction is consistent with the fraction of ordinary blue - sequence galaxies that are visually classified as being morphologically disturbed ( figure [ fig : visual ] ) , and therefore the morphological disturbance may not be directly related to the starburst event .",

    "this provides a qualitative fit to the galaxy merger picture emerging from numerical simulations where , after the coalescence of the two progenitors , the morphological disturbance of the system gradually fades away leading to formation of a morphologically undisturbed remnant ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    to investigate the role of galaxy mergers in inducing starburst events in massive star - forming galaxies , we must focus on galaxies which have experienced a very recent starburst , so that at the time of observations their tidal features have not begun to vanish .",
    "consequently , we consider the youngest age - bin in figure [ fig : visauto ] ( left panel ) to deduce that , based on the investigated sample , we can attribute at least 45% of the ( post-)starburst signatures to galaxy mergers .",
    "the remaining 55% could be a result of 1 ) either galaxy mergers / interactions under conditions that fail to produce tidal signatures in the remnants morphologies or , 2 ) some other internal processes .",
    "the fact that 30% of our control sample of blue - sequence galaxies are also visually identified as being morphologically disturbed , additionally indicates that either galaxy mergers in the local universe can cause significant morphological disturbance without inducing a central starburst , or morphological disturbance is not a good predictor of a past merger event .    in future work",

    "we will also aim to constrain the upper limit on the fraction of ( post-)starburst galaxies which have originated from a merger by considering galaxy mergers found in cosmological simulations .",
    "+   +   +      the values of @xmath72 obtained for galaxies with the youngest starbursts ( @xmath2 gyr ) are as high or even higher than those found for the continuously star - forming and quiescent galaxies , and they tend to decrease with the starburst age . in the previous section , we attributed this effect primarily to the decaying nuclear starburst but we also noted that contributions from faint tidal features in galaxies may increase the corresponding values of @xmath72 .",
    "although our analysis of the test sample suggests that the presence of faint tidal features should have a marginal effect on @xmath72 in ( post-)starburst galaxies , here , we address this concept again by investigating the behaviour of the gini index in the morphologically disturbed and undisturbed subsets of our ( post-)starburst sample separately .    in figure",
    "[ fig : bulge_distundist]b we present the evolution of @xmath72 for ( post-)starburst galaxies with regular morphologies as identified by visual inspection . in this case",
    ", we still observe a declining trend in @xmath72 with starburst age ( @xmath148 , @xmath137 ) , however slightly less pronounced than that found for the total sample ( @xmath149 , @xmath150 ) .",
    "this implies that the contribution from the tidal features is indeed not consequential and that the time - evolution of the inequality in the light distribution within ( post-)starburst galaxies is predominantly an effect of the decaying starburst .",
    "this is further supported by figure [ fig : bulge_distundist]c , where we consider the values of @xmath72 computed using images in the @xmath19-band . in this regime , there is more light from younger stars with shorter lifetimes than in the case of the @xmath16-band , and therefore , the effects of the decaying starburst should be more apparent .",
    "as expected , we find a stronger declining trend in @xmath72 as a function of the starburst age in the @xmath19-band ( @xmath151 , @xmath150 ) .",
    "the observed trends in the values of @xmath72 suggest that the photometric signatures of the most recent starburst , in both the @xmath16-band and the @xmath19-band , fade away after @xmath152 gyr since the starburst event .",
    "our analysis shows that the ( post-)starburst galaxies typically have structural properties characteristic of early - type disks ( reflected in the values of @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath76 ) , with values similar to those found for the star - forming blue - cloud galaxies and somewhat lower than those measured for the quiescent red - sequence galaxies in our control samples .",
    "the average structural properties of the sample are largely a result of our sample selection , where we only considered galaxies with high stellar surface mass densities .",
    "more interestingly , the lack of evolution in these structural parameters with starburst age , and in particular the values of @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath76 for the oldest ( post-)starbursts , leads us to conclude that the ( post-)starburst galaxies do not attain the highly concentrated structure typical for red - sequence galaxies within the first 0.6 gyr following a merger .",
    "this does not necessarily imply that they are not heading toward the red sequence ; perhaps further structural evolution is required for the final transition to occur .",
    "a similar conclusion was found in a recent study of a subset of the ( post-)starburst galaxies used in this work , by @xcite , who found a substantial amount of gas remaining in these galaxies , that could sustain star formation for at least 0.5 - 1 gyr after the starburst , suggesting that the post - starburst galaxies are not yet fully quenched .",
    "we note the following caveats in our conclusions .",
    "the galaxies in our control sample of red - sequence galaxies to which we compare , have not necessarily quenched their star formation recently and could have undergone some structural evolution while residing on the red sequence .",
    "furthermore , present - day red - sequence galaxies that experienced their star - formation quenching earlier in the history of the universe , when the physical conditions were significantly different to the present day , may not be representative of the ` future ' red - sequence which will form once the residual star - formation within the present - day ( post-)starburst galaxies have ceased .",
    "further study of ( post-)starburst galaxies at higher redshifts , including those with @xmath153 gyr , as well as a more extended sample of red - sequence galaxies , and a quantitative comparison with previous studies are underway .",
    "it is thought that the observed bimodality in galaxy properties could be a result of a transformation from gas - rich actively star - forming galaxies to passively evolving galaxies devoid of gas , following some star - formation quenching event ( e.g. bell et al .",
    "2004 , faber et al . 2007 ) . in this work , we focused on one of the possible quenching routes , involving a transition through a post - starburst phase subsequent to a gas - rich merger event ( e.g. sanders et al .",
    "1988 , wild et al .",
    "2009 , yesuf et al .",
    "our study involved the morphological and structural analysis of an evolutionary sample of 335 bulge - galaxies with the strongest ( post-)starburst signatures within the sdss dr7 , with equal number of galaxies per unit starburst age ( @xmath33 ) with @xmath154 gyr .",
    "the unique sample properties provided an opportunity for a statistical study of a sequence of galaxies evolving through the short - lasting phase following a nuclear starburst .",
    "for the analysis , we used standard measures of galaxy structure found in the literature as well as a newly introduced morphological indicator designed to trace faint asymmetric tidal features in the outskirts of the galaxies .",
    "below , we list the main results of our study and their implications .    *",
    "the new measure of morphological asymmetry introduced in this work provides a robust method for probing asymmetric tidal features in the outskirts of galaxies and allows for an effective detection of galaxies in late stages of a merger . within our test sample ,",
    "the shape asymmetry criterion @xmath155 identifies 95@xmath47 ( 19/20 ) of galaxies with faint tidal features and @xmath108 ( 6/10 ) of those with low / moderate morphological disturbance . applied to our ( post-)starburst sample",
    ", @xmath155 detects @xmath1 of the galaxies with the youngest starbursts ( @xmath2 gyr ) , a fraction which is in a remarkable agreement with that obtained by visual inspection of the images . * the fraction of ( post-)starburst galaxies which show features characteristic of post - mergers declines with the starburst age .",
    "for the morphologically disturbed ( post-)starburst galaxies , the measured values of @xmath67 decrease with the starburst age , with @xmath147 for most galaxies with starbursts older than 0.5 gyr.these trends fit qualitatively to the galaxy merger picture , where the morphological disturbance of the merger remnant gradually fades away as the remnant evolves through the dynamically - cold post - merger phase ( see e.g. @xcite ) . *",
    "assuming that morphological disturbance in galaxies is an indicator of a past merger , both visual classification and the automated approach ( using the shape asymmetry ) suggest that at least @xmath1 of the youngest ( post-)starburst galaxies in the sample ( @xmath2 gyr ) have originated in a merger . *",
    "the insignificant age - evolution of their central concentration , light profiles or the extent of the brightest regions , suggests that ( post-)starburst galaxies do not attain the structure of the fully - quenched galaxies within the first 0.6 gyr after the starburst .",
    "rather , their structure bears more resemblance to that of the continuously star - forming galaxies .",
    "further structural evolution is required before the post - starburst galaxies can become comparable to galaxies populating the present - day red sequence .",
