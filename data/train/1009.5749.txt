    "let @xmath0 be a sequence of measurable spaces . for every @xmath1",
    "we denote by @xmath2 the set of probability measures on @xmath3 .",
    "suppose we have a sequence of probability measures @xmath4 where @xmath5 is known and we have for @xmath6 the following nonlinear measure - valued equations @xmath7 for some mappings @xmath8 .",
    "except in some particular situations , these measure - valued equations do not admit an analytic solution .",
    "being able to solve these equations numerically has numerous applications in nonlinear filtering , global optimization , bayesian statistics and physics as it would allow us to approximate any sequence of fixed `` target '' probability distributions @xmath9 .",
    "for example , in a nonlinear filtering framework @xmath10 corresponds to the posterior distribution of the state of an unobserved dynamic model at time @xmath11 given the observations collected from time @xmath12 to time @xmath11 . in an optimization framework , @xmath10 could correspond to a sequence of annealed versions of a distribution @xmath13 that we are interested in maximizing . in both cases , @xmath14 is a feynman  kac transformation @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", there has been considerable interest in the development of interacting particle interpretations of measure - valued equations of the form ( [ phi ] ) which we briefly review here .",
    "the central idea of interacting particle methods is to construct a markov chain @xmath15 taking values in the product spaces @xmath16 so that the empirical measure @xmath17 approximates @xmath10 as @xmath18 . in the simpler version ,",
    "we construct inductively @xmath19 by sampling @xmath20 independent random variables with common law @xmath21 .",
    "the rationale behind this is that the resulting particle measure @xmath22 should be a good approximation of @xmath10 as long as @xmath23 is a good approximation of @xmath24 .",
    "more formally , @xmath25 is an @xmath26-valued markov chain with elementary transitions given by the following formula : @xmath27 where @xmath28 stands for an infinitesimal neighborhood of a point in the product space @xmath26 .    for feynman ",
    "kac transformations , these interacting particle models have been extensively studied and they are sometimes referred to as sequential monte carlo methods , particle filters and population monte carlo methods ; see @xcite for a review of the literature . in this context , the convergence analysis of these particle algorithms is now well understood .",
    "a variety of theoretical results are available , including sharp propagations of chaos properties , fluctuations and large deviations theorems , as well as uniform convergence results with respect to the level index @xmath11 .",
    "these interacting particle methods suffer from two serious limitations .",
    "first , when the mapping @xmath14 is complex , it may be impossible to generate independent draws from it .",
    "second , it is typically impossible to determine beforehand the number of particles necessary to achieve a fixed precision for a given application and users usually have to perform multiple runs for an increasing number of particles until stabilization of the monte carlo estimates is observed .",
    "markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) methods appear as a natural way to solve these two problems @xcite .",
    "however , standard mcmc methods do not apply in this context as we have a sequence of target distributions defined on different spaces and the normalizing constants of these distributions are typically unknown .",
    "we propose here a new class of interacting mcmc methods ( i - mcmc ) to solve these nonlinear measure - valued equations numerically .",
    "these i - mcmc methods can be described as adaptive and dynamic simulation algorithms which take advantage of the information carried by the past history to increase the quality of the next sequence of samples . moreover , in contrast to interacting particle methods , these stochastic algorithms can increase the precision and performance of the numerical approximations iteratively .",
    "the origins of i - mcmc methods can be traced back to a pair of articles @xcite presented by the first author in collaboration with laurent miclo .",
    "these studies are concerned with biology - inspired self - interacting markov chain ( simc ) models with applications to genetic type algorithms involving a competition between a reinforcement mechanism and a potential function @xcite .",
    "these ideas have been extended to the mcmc methodology in the joint articles of the authors with christophe andrieu and ajay jasra @xcite , as well as in the more recent article of the authors with anthony brockwell @xcite .",
    "related ideas have also appeared in computational chemistry @xcite and statistics @xcite .    in the present article , we design a new general class of i - mcmc methods . roughly speaking ,",
    "these algorithms proceed as follows . at level @xmath29 we run an mcmc algorithm to obtain a chain @xmath30 targeting @xmath5 .",
    "note that here the `` time '' index @xmath31 corresponds to the number of iterations of the i - mcmc algorithm .",
    "we use the occupation measure of the chain @xmath32 at time @xmath31 judiciously to design a second mcmc algorithm to generate @xmath33 at level 1 targeting @xmath34 which is typically more complex than @xmath5 .",
    "more precisely , the elementary transition @xmath35 of the chain @xmath36 at time @xmath31 depends on the occupation measure of @xmath37 .",
    "similarly we use the empirical measure of @xmath38 at level @xmath39 to `` feed '' an mcmc algorithm generating @xmath25 targeting @xmath10 at level @xmath11 .",
    "these i - mcmc samplers are simc in reference to the fact that the complete markov chain @xmath40 associated with a fixed series of @xmath41 levels evolves with elementary transitions @xmath42 that depend on the occupation measure of the whole system @xmath43 from time @xmath12 up to time @xmath44 .    from the pure mathematical point of view",
    ", the convergence analysis of simc is essentially based on the study of the stability properties of sophisticated markov chains with elementary transitions depending in a nonlinear way on the occupation measure of the chains .",
    "hence the theoretical analysis of simc is much more involved than the one of traditional markov chains .",
    "it also differs significantly from interacting particle methods developed in @xcite . besides the introduction of a new methodology",
    ", our main contribution is a refined theoretical analysis based on measure - valued processes and semigroup methods to analyze their asymptotic behavior as the time index @xmath31 tends to infinity .",
