    "<S> we show that the latter imposes strong bounds on the strength of the vector coupling in the model . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the commonly used on - shell treatment of the vector and axial mesons ( identified as poles at large timelike momenta ) fails to reproduce the behavior of the corresponding correlation functions at small spacelike momenta extracted from the physical spectral density . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters of the njl model fixed by the correlation functions at small spacelike momenta differ noticeably from those of the on - shell treatment .    </S>",

    "<S> 1#1 - 6pt/    = 0.4 cm    rub - tpii-19/94 + december , 94    the correlation functions of different colorless hadronic currents built of quarks and gluons offer a general tool to study the structure of the qcd vacuum and the hadron spectrum  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one can obtain information about the physical intermediate states from the pole structure of the correlation functions in the timelike region as well as from its behavior at spacelike momenta . </S>",
    "<S> for an exact theory both ways should lead to identical results . </S>",
    "<S> this , however , is not necessarily true for the effective models , which in the present lack of non - perturbative solution to qcd attract an increasing interest . among them , </S>",
    "<S> the nambu  jona - lasinio model , proposed  @xcite in early sixties in analogy with the bcs theory of superconductivity , plays an essential role . </S>",
    "<S> this model incorporates the basic symmetries of qcd and in particular , the chiral symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> it is able to manifest the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and , as a natural consequence , the appearance of the pseudoscalar mesons as goldstone particles . as such it offers a simple but quite successful working scheme to study the role of the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking mechanism in hadron physics ( for review see refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . however , the model suffers from two important drawbacks . </S>",
    "<S> first , it is not renormalizable and to make the theory finite one needs a finite cut off fixed in a consisitent way ( usually to reproduce the pion decay constant ) and the limit of large @xmath0 ( number of colors ) . </S>",
    "<S> the typical value of the cut off is about 1 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the second problem is the lack of confinement . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , these drawbacks make the so far used on - shell treatment of the ( axial ) vector mesons questionable  @xcite . in the present work </S>",
    "<S> we will show that the proper way to overcome this problem is to consider the corresponding current correlation function at small spacelike momenta . in this case </S>",
    "<S> we do not face the problem of the strong coupling to the @xmath1 continuum and we apply the model at small momentum region where it is designed for . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we make essentially use of the fact that the correlator at small spacelike momenta can be related via dispersion relations to well - established rich phenomenology without detailed knowledge of the dynamics at large timelike momenta . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that such a scheme allows to describe the vector modes in the meson sector of the njl model in a consistent way .    </S>",
    "<S> the simplest su(2 ) nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model is defined by lagrangean  @xcite : @xmath2 \\nonumber\\\\ & -&{g_v\\over 2 } \\ , [ ( \\bar \\psi\\gamma_\\mu \\vec\\tau \\psi ) ^2 + ( \\bar \\psi \\vec\\tau\\gamma_\\mu \\gamma_5 \\psi ) ^2\\ , ] \\,,\\label{njllag}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which contains chirally invariant local four - fermion interactions with scalar @xmath3 and vector @xmath4 couplings.the current quark mass @xmath5 stands for both @xmath6 and @xmath7 quarks ( assumed to be degenerated in mass ) .    applying the well - known bosonization procedure  @xcite we arrive at the model generating functional expressed as a functional integral over auxiliary boson fields @xmath8 : @xmath9\\bigr)+ i_m[s,{\\vec p},{\\vec v_\\mu},{\\vec a_\\mu}]}\\ , , \\label{genf}\\ ] ] where the quarks are already integrated out . to simplify our notations we adopt for @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 that @xmath13 etc . the euclidean dirac operator @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 and the trace over colors is explicitly done . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry breaking term is included in the boson part : @xmath16    in the large @xmath0 limit the integral in eq.([genf ] ) is given by its saddle point value . </S>",
    "<S> for the translational invariant case ( vacuum ) we have a non - trivial stationary meson configuration given by @xmath17 which means that the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken . </S>",
    "<S> the quarks acquire a constituent mass @xmath18 which is related to the scalar coupling constant @xmath3 via the stationary condition ( saddle point ) : @xmath19}\\bigr)+m_0=m_0-g_s < \\bar \\psi \\psi > \\ , . \\label{gap}\\ ] ] here @xmath20 is the chiral quark condensate . </S>",
    "<S> as it was mentioned the model is not renormalizable and in order to make the fermion determinant finite it must be regularized . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the model has four parameters , namely two coupling constants @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the current mass @xmath5 and the cut off @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> usually they are fixed reproducing the physical pion decay constant and the physical masses of pion and rho meson . </S>",
    "<S> it leaves one parameter free which is commonly chosen to be the constituent mass @xmath18 because with eq.([gap ] ) one can eliminate @xmath3 in favor of @xmath18 . in principle , one can use the empirical value for the quark condensate @xmath20 to constrain @xmath18 . however </S>",
    "<S> , being quadratically divergent @xmath20 is very sensitive to the details of the regularization scheme .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we suggest an alternative way of fixing the model parameters @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath21 . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we study the correlation functions of the pseudoscalar , vector and axial - vector currents : @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 in the njl model . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation functions are defined by the vacuum - to - vacuum matrix elements of the currents and can be expressed in terms of invariant functions as follows : @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 where as usual @xmath28 is defined as @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the vector current in the real world the axial - vector current is not conserved and the correlation function in the axial channel has an additional longitudinal part @xmath30 which vanishes in the chiral limit @xmath31 . in the njl model the matrix element of rhs of eqs.([pcrdeff]-[acrdeff ] ) can be expressed as a path integral using the model generating functional ( [ genf ] ) . in the leading order in @xmath0 only two diagrams ( shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figr1 ] ) contribute to the matrix elements . </S>",
    "<S> the first one is a simple one - quark loop whereas the second includes a boson line . for the pseudoscalar function </S>",
    "<S> we get the following result :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 function @xmath34 corresponds to the quark - loop diagram with two pseudoscalar - isovector vertices ( @xmath35 ) . as already mentioned , the model is not renormalizable and in order to make the quark loop finite we need a regularization . in our calculations </S>",
    "<S> we use the proper - time as well as the pauli - villars regularization scheme . both schemes </S>",
    "<S> preserve the symmetries of the model . </S>",
    "<S> here we present only the proper - time regularized expression for @xmath34  @xcite : @xmath36}\\ , , \\label{bpq}\\ ] ] and for the condensate : @xmath37 details as well as regularized expressions for the quark condensate and the function @xmath34 in the case of pauli - villars regularization can be found in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    in the chiral limit the pseudoscalar correlation function ( [ pq ] ) </S>",
    "<S> develops the expected goldstone pole at @xmath38 : @xmath39 where the pion decay constant @xmath40 is given by the residue of the pole : @xmath41    the non - zero current mass @xmath5 shifts the pion pole in eq.([pq0 ] ) to @xmath42 and one recovers the gell - mann - oakes - renner relation : @xmath43    in the vector channel the correlation function @xmath44 is given by @xmath45 where , similarly to @xmath34 , the function @xmath46 corresponds to the quark - loop diagram with two vector vertices ( @xmath47 ) ( lhs of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figr1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , in the proper - time scheme it has the following form : @xmath48}\\ , . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{bvq}\\ ] ]    for the transverse invariant function of the axial current correlator in the njl model we have : @xmath49 whereas the longitudinal one includes only a pion contribution : @xmath50    the correlation functions ( [ pvq2]),([ptaq0 ] ) possess ( at some model parameter values ) poles in the timelike region @xmath51 which is in fact the pole of the propagator of the auxiliary ( axial ) vector field . </S>",
    "<S> this is used in the so - called on - shell treatment @xcite where one fixes the vector coupling constant @xmath4 adjusting the position of the pole to the physical rho mass . </S>",
    "<S> the other model parameters , namely the cutoff @xmath21 and the current mass @xmath5 are fixed reproducing the physical pion mass and the physical pion decay constant from eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fpi]),([gmor ] ) , whereas the constituent quark mass is treated as a free parameter as usual . to illustrate the on - shell scheme we present in fig.[figr2 ] </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding parameter values ( index `` pole '' ) as a function of @xmath18 for the case of the the pauli - villars regularization . </S>",
    "<S> since the results with the proper - time regularization are almost identical with those of the proper - time ones we do not discuss them separately . as can be seen the behavior of the coupling constants and </S>",
    "<S> the cutoff as function of the constituent mass is not smooth  the value @xmath52 is a singular point where all curves show a kink . at @xmath53 </S>",
    "<S> the vector current correlation function has a real pole at @xmath54 which is an indication for a bound state in the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> however , because of lack of confinement a second peak in the @xmath1 continuum appears , which is not taken into account in the definition of the physical @xmath55 field . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , it is hard to relate the second peak to the excited @xmath56-resonance . at smaller values of @xmath57 in the vector channel </S>",
    "<S> a broad resonance appears in the @xmath1 continuum because the corresponding pole moves to the complex plane of @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> the position of the peak depends on the vector coupling constant @xmath4 . using this we determine @xmath4 fixing the position of the peak in the vector spectral function @xmath59 at the physical @xmath55 mass . </S>",
    "<S> however , as can be seen from fig.[figr2 ] it is not always possible to find a solution for @xmath4 : for @xmath18 between 230 and 260 mev in fact there is no such a solution . </S>",
    "<S> it should be also noted that at @xmath53 both @xmath4 and @xmath3 , as well as the cutoff @xmath21 show a stronger dependence on @xmath18 as @xmath4 is dominant ( @xmath60 . this changes for smaller values of @xmath18 where @xmath3 and @xmath21 stay almost constant whereas @xmath4 decreases . in the axial channel for the values of the constituent mass @xmath18 considered ( 200 - 450 mev ) the @xmath61 meson appears as a very broad peak being centered around 1 gev in the @xmath1 continuum . in fig.[figr2 ] we also show the parameter values ( index `` grad '' ) obtained by means of a gradient or heat - kernel expansion of the effective action  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure is frequently used to fix the vector coupling constant @xmath4 in njl model and in fact it is an approximation to the on - shell description of vector modes . </S>",
    "<S> as can be seen from fig.[figr2 ] this procedure provides a quite crude approximation to the on - shell values because of the large masses of the vector mesons . from the above discussion one </S>",
    "<S> concludes that the on - shell treatment is not able to provide a consistent description of the vector meson modes in njl model .    as a next step </S>",
    "<S> we suggest to make use of the fact that at spacelike momenta @xmath62 the vector and axial - vector current correlation functions can be related to the experimentally known spectral density via dispersion relations . in the vector channel </S>",
    "<S> the invariant function @xmath44 satisfies a dispersion relation with one subtraction : @xmath63 where the physical spectral density @xmath64 is experimentally accessible : @xmath65 for the rhs we use a simple ( @xmath55 + continuum ) parameterization  @xcite of the experimental data @xmath66 with the parameter values : @xmath67    eqs.([disprel ] ) and ( [ expspv ] ) provide an independent way to fix the vector coupling constant @xmath4 confronting the model with the experiment by equating the phenomenological dispersion integral and the model correlation function at low positive @xmath58 : @xmath68    the resulting @xmath4 as well as @xmath21 and @xmath3 as a function of @xmath18 , obtained by adjusting ( @xmath69-fit ) the lhs of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ phvq2 ] ) to the rhs with the physical spectral density ( [ expspv ] ) at low positive momenta ( we consider @xmath70 gev@xmath71 ) , are shown ( index `` corr '' ) in fig.[figr2 ] a ) and b ) . </S>",
    "<S> apparently the correlation function at spacelike momenta and the on - shell treatment yield rather different results . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the curves resulting from the on - shell scheme those of the correlation function have the advantage to behave smoothly as a function of @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> this , and the very fact that the njl model is designed for low - energy structures involving small momenta , makes the above correlation method preferable . with increasing @xmath18 larger values for @xmath4 are needed to fit the phenomenological side whereas the @xmath3 is slightly decreasing .    in the axial channel , </S>",
    "<S> since the longitudinal part of the axial correlation function is almost independent on the @xmath4 and @xmath18 , we will concentrate our further discussion on its transverse part @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> it obeys a dispersion relation with two subtractions : @xmath73 similar to the vector channel for @xmath74 we take a simplified ( @xmath61 + continuum ) parameterization  @xcite @xmath75 with parameters  @xcite : @xmath76    confronting the model @xmath61-correlation function  ( [ ptaq0 ] ) and the phenomenological expressions  ( [ pat ] ) ,  ( [ expspa ] ) one has another way to fix the vector coupling constant @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained vector coupling constant ( @xmath77 ) as a function of @xmath18 is shown in fig.[figr2 ] a ) in comparison with the results from fitting the @xmath55 phenomenology as well as from the on - shell @xmath55 treatment and the derivative expansion . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the vector channel the model axial function @xmath78 depends much stronger on the constituent mass and because of that the model is able to fit simultaneously both @xmath55- and @xmath61-channels only within a narrow window of values for the constituent quark mass @xmath18 around 240 mev . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that in this window the on - shell values are also very close to those obtained from the correlation functions . </S>",
    "<S> the particular value of @xmath18 depends on the parameter values ( [ vparam]),([aparam ] ) used for the ( resonance + continuum ) parameterizations . </S>",
    "<S> in fact the estimate of the constituent mass @xmath79 mev in the random instanton model  @xcite of qcd vacuum , applied successfully also to the meson correlation functions  @xcite , is not far from our numbers . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting vector coupling constant @xmath4 is of the same order as the scalar one @xmath3 . in this point </S>",
    "<S> we disagree with ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in which constraining the njl model via qcd sum rules it is concluded that @xmath4 should be almost zero or at least @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> it is due to the fact that in contrast to us in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the njl model is treated in a quite simplified approximate way ignoring the full @xmath58-dependence of the correlation functions as well as the relations between the model parameters fixed to reproduce the physical pion properties .    in our calculations </S>",
    "<S> so far we used simple parameterizations ( [ expspv]),([expspa ] ) for the experimental spectral densities in which the resonance widths are neglected . in order to check this approximation we repeated the calculations using a much more elaborated ( finite - width resonance+continuum ) parameterization  @xcite of the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained results follow qualitatively the picture of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figr2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the only difference is that the narrow window , where in both vector and axial channels the experimental low - energy behavior of the correlation functions can be reproduced simultaneously , is shifted to higher values of the constituent mass @xmath81 mev .    </S>",
    "<S> we also related the model with @xmath4 , fixed in the present scheme , to the chiral effective lagrangean of gasser and leutwyler  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> following ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we calculated the corresponding low - energy coefficients @xmath82 in the notation of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and low - energy pionic characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> as can be seen from table  [ tabl1 ] our theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the empirical values .    </S>",
    "<S> to summarize , in this letter we study the vector meson modes in the njl model in terms of current correlation functions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the on - shell treatment of the vector meson fails to reproduce the low - energy behavior of the correlation functions fixed by the experimentally known spectral density via dispersion relations . </S>",
    "<S> we offer a different scheme to fix the njl - model parameters based on the behavior of the correlation functions at small spacelike momenta . treating the vector coupling constant as a free parameter </S>",
    "<S> the model is able to reproduce the phenomenology in both the axial- and vector channels for the constituent mass only in a narrow window around 240 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the vector coupling constant is by no means zero and is of the same order as the scalar coupling constant . in principle , these two schemes , the on - shell treatment ( large timelike momenta ) and the one based on the behavior of the correlation function at small spacelike momenta , should provide identical results within an `` exact '' theory , which however is not the case for an effective model like njl . </S>",
    "<S> in the latter case the correlation function method appears to be preferable . </S>",
    "<S> one also should keep in mind that the present considerations are done in leading order in @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of @xmath83 quantum boson ( loop ) corrections could in principle change the present results . </S>"
