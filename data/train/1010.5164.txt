    "what drives the decline in sfr ?",
    "several scenarios have been proposed , including the depletion of cold gas due to continuous star formation and/or merger - driven bursts ( e.g. bekki & couch 2003 ) ; a decrease in the rate of galaxy - galaxy interactions that trigger star formation ( e.g. le fvre et  al . 2000 ; bridge et  al .",
    "2007 ; but see also lotz et  al . 2008 ) ; and the quenching of star formation in galaxies entering increasingly dense environments as structure forms in the universe ( e.g. larson et  al . 1980 ) .",
    "many of the mechanisms that fall within the above categories result not only in a decline in the global sfr , but also in an environmental dependence on sfr .",
    "indeed , it is well - established that the sfrs of galaxies in the local universe correlate with environment , in the sense that high - density environments have a lower fraction of star - forming galaxies than low - density environments ( e.g. hashimoto et  al . 1998 ; lewis et  al . 2002 ; g ' omez et  al .",
    "2003 ; balogh et  al .",
    "2004 ; kauffmann et  al . 2004 ; blanton & moustakas 2009 ) .",
    "large spectroscopic and photometric redshift surveys of the general field have allowed the study of the sfr - density relation out to @xmath13 .",
    "such studies have been undertaken in goods ( elbaz et  al . 2007 ) , deep2 ( gerke et  al . 2007 ; cooper et  al .",
    "2007 , 2008 ) , vvds ( cucciati et  al .",

    "the environmental dependence of star formation has been the detailed study of galaxy clusters .",
    "this method ensures the inclusion of large numbers of galaxies in high - density environments , which may be rare in field surveys .",
    "furthermore , cluster studies can help clarify how the global cluster environment influences galaxy properties relative to the local galaxy environment .",
    "the sfrs in clusters have been examined in various studies , including surveys of multiple clusters such as cnoc ( balogh et  al .",

    "2006 ) .",
    "a full understanding of the evolution of the environmental dependence of sfr has been impeded by at least two observational limitations .",
    "first , most of the above general field and targeted cluster studies were carried out in the rest - frame optical , which suffers from the effects of dust extinction . because they make use of sfrs that are computed from long - wavelength data that are less affected by dust , the goods and shades studies are notable exceptions among the above general field studies , as are the _ spitzer_/mips gto and smirc studies of clusters .",
    "second , the total number of clusters studied remains fairly small in the face of the large cluster - to - cluster variations observed ( e.g. finn et  al . 2005 ) .",
    "this paper is one in a series based on the eso distant cluster survey ( ediscs ; white et  al .",
    "2005 ; halliday et  al . 2004 ; poggianti et  al .",
    "2006 ; desai et  al .",
    "we address the above limitations by presenting _ spitzer_/mips observations of 16 intermediate - redshift ( @xmath14 ) ediscs clusters .",
    "not only does this triple the number of well - studied clusters at these redshifts , but the mips observations allow us to characterize the dust - obscured sfrs .",
    "these observations also have the advantage that they provide us with a sfr - limited sample of cluster galaxies .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe the cluster sample in  [ ediscs ] and the _ spitzer_/mips data in  [ data ] .",
    "we then describe the selection of the cluster members in  [ samples ] and the conversion from observed 24  flux to total ir luminosity in  [ lirtot ] . in  [ gems ] ,",

    "all magnitudes are relative to vega .",
    "the clusters targeted in this survey are drawn from ediscs ( white et  al .",
    "ediscs is an eso large programme that targeted 20 fields with vlt imaging and spectroscopy , and ntt near - ir imaging . in those fields ,",
    "26 structures ( groups and clusters ) have been identified ( halliday et  al . 2004 ; milvang - jensen et  al .",
    "one field contained no signficant structure , and the structure cl1103.7 - 1245 at @xmath19 does not contain many spectroscopically - confirmed members .",
    "the remaining 18 fields contain 17 primary structures and 7 secondary ones , where primary denotes the most massive structure in each field .",
    "these comprise the only sizable sample of low - mass clusters that has been studied in such detail at high redshift .",
    "mass estimates for the ediscs  clusters have been derived from weak lensing ( clowe et  al .",
    "2006 ) and velocity dispersions .",
    "we targeted only 16 primary clusters with @xmath20 ( we omit the primary structure in the cl1119.3 - 1129 field because of its low velocity dispersion ) .",
    "the redshift and velocity dispersions of the clusters are listed in table [ detect ] .",
    "all 16 clusters have extensive ground - based data that cover the same approximate area imaged by _ spitzer _ , including multiband photometry and spectroscopy .",
    "there are 30 - 50 spectroscopically - confirmed members per cluster .",
    "photometric redshifts , spectroscopic results , and ground - based morphologies are available for a 5@xmath215  region around each cluster . furthermore , derived - data products such as k - corrected absolute magnitudes and estimates of the total number of member galaxies ( pello et  al .",
    "2009 ; rudnick et  al .",
    "2009 ) are readily available .",
    "the velocity dispersions and redshifts of the ediscs  clusters are not correlated ( see table [ detect ] ) , an important point to demonstrate before looking for evolutionary trends within the sample .",
    "infrared observations of cluster galaxies by the _ infrared space observatory _ ( iso ; kessler et  al . 1996 )",
    "allowed the first look at obscured star - forming galaxies in distant clusters ( metcalfe et  al .",
    "however , systematic coverage of clusters could not be conducted with _",
    "iso _ given the time it would have required to obtain multi - positioned and heavily - overlapped rasters of such targets .",
    "the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "( werner et  al . 2004 ) provides not only the desired coverage of clusters , but with the improved sensitivity necessary to probe the infrared properties of cluster galaxies to lower masses and to larger redshifts , providing a unique opportunity to explore their evolution .",
    "we obtained images of the clusters at 24@xmath22 using the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ; rieke et  al .",
    "observations of the 16 clusters were taken during cycles 2 and 3 under guest observer programs 20009 and 30102 .",
    "we imaged the central 5@xmath215  of each cluster to match the areal coverage of the ground - based vlt data .",
    "this area corresponds to a projected size of 1.8@xmath211.8 mpc at z=0.5 and 2.3@xmath212.3 mpc at z=0.8 , which incorporates @xmath23% of the volume within the virial region at both epochs , assuming a typical comoving virial radius of 1  mpc .    to map the 5@xmath215  area , we use mips photometry in large field mode .",
    "we complete 10 cycles of 10 sec exposures for the @xmath24 clusters and 20 cycles of 10 sec exposures for the higher - redshift clusters .",
    "we use a 20  sky offset , which effectively doubles our on - source exposure time .      the post - basic calibration data images produced by the _",
    "science center ( ssc ) pipeline show large scale variations in the sky level that are not effectively corrected by the flat field .",
    "we therefore start our data reduction by applying an additional flatfield correction to the basic calibration data ( bcd ) images . to do this , we first run sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) on individual bcd images . using the source list from sextractor , we mask all pixels that lie within a 10-pixel radius of an object .",
    "we then average the masked bcd images using the iraf routine imcombine to create a flat .",
    "we use the mosaicker and point source extractor ( mopex ) routine _ mosaic.pl _ to create a mosaic of the flattened images , and we fit the point response function ( prf ) in each mosaiced image using the astronomical point source extraction ( apex ) routine _",
    "prf_estimate.pl_. we then use the apex routine _",
    "apex_1frame.pl _ to identify sources and extract aperture photometry .",
    "we use the total flux value calculated by mopex .    to test for systematics in our data reduction procedure",
    ", we compare the aperture fluxes from the mosaic made from mopex with a mosaic made using the mips instrument team s data analysis tool v. 3.06 ( dat ; gordon et  al .",
    "2005 ) for the cluster cl1216 .",
    "the average ratio of the dat to mopex aperture fluxes measured in an aperture with a 4-pixel ( 10.2 ) diameter is @xmath25 , so fluxes are consistent at the 10% level .",
    "the rms increases with aperture size ; the average ratio is @xmath26 using an aperture with a diameter of 6 pixels ( 15.3 ) .",
    "fluxes resulting from mopex and dat reductions are consistent , and we use the mopex reduction for the rest of the sample .",
    "we use the iraf artdata package to estimate our detection efficiency as a function of source brightness .",
    "the cluster galaxies that we are studying are smaller than the mips 24  psf , so we add point sources into the final mosaiced image .",
    "we add 1000 sources with fluxes ranging uniformly from 10@xmath27jy to 180@xmath27jy .",
    "the artificial sources are positioned randomly on each mosaiced image , avoiding edges and previously - placed artificial sources .",
    "we limit the number of artificial sources to 10 per image so that we do not significantly alter the source density and repeat the simulation 100 times per cluster image to accumulate 1000 artificial sources per cluster .",
    "we convolve the sources with a prf from the ssc derived from a mosaiced 24  image .",
    "we use this rather than the prf measured from each image because our measured prfs are frequently contaminated by nearby sources whereas the ssc prf is not .",
    "we then rerun _ apex_1frame.pl _ and determine the fraction of artificial sources detected as a function of source brightness .",
    "the results show that our 80% completeness limit ranges from 72@xmath27jy to 100@xmath27jy , with the 80% completeness flux level listed for individual clusters in table [ detect ] .",
    "although the alignment of the optical and 24  images is good , we find systematic offsets between the images that can be as large as 1.1 . to correct for this misalignment , we perform a first - pass match between the optical and ir sources . from the matched sources , we calculate the average offset between the optical and 24  positions and",
    "then adjust the 24  coordinates so that the average offset between the optical and ir positions is zero in both ra and dec .",
    "we then rematch the optical and ir sources using the shifted 24  coordinates .",
    "we find a total of 2337 24  sources in the 16 cluster images that have a signal - to - noise ratio greater than 2.5 .",
    "we are able to match 1911 of these ( @xmath28% ) to optical counterparts in the ediscs  source catalogs using a match radius of 2  between the 24  and optical source . when multiple sources lie within 2 , we select the optical counterpart that is closest to the 24  source .",
    "overall , 222 sources ( 9% ) have more than one optical match within 2 .",
    "we find 426 24  detections that are not matched to an object in the ediscs  catalog .",
    "some of these ir sources ( 79 ) are false detections , lying near the edge of the 24  image or associated with the airy ring of a bright 24  source .",
    "other ir sources ( 48 ) are unmatched because they overlap a bright , extended optical source , and thus any optical counterpart is undetectable in the optical image .",
    "the number of remaining unmatched 24  sources is 268 . of these ,",
    "125 sources ( 5% of the ir galaxies ) appear to be a blend of one or more optical sources ; these have an optical counterpart , it just is not clear which one is the counterpart .",
    "we consider the remaining 143 sources to be obscured sources ; 76 coincide with a faint optical source that is below the detection limit of the ediscs  catalog , and the remaining 67 sources have no optical counterpart in the ediscs  i - band image .",
    "these sources are likely to lie at redshifts beyond our clusters ( e.g. le floch et  al . 2005 ) .",
    "we calculate cluster membership in two complementary ways .",
    "we use spectroscopic redshifts to conclusively establish the membership when available . the majority of galaxies in each cluster , however",
    ", does not have spectroscopy , and we therefore use photometric redshifts to determine cluster membership for the galaxies with no spectroscopy . the ediscs spectroscopy is described in detail in halliday et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) and milvang - jensen et  al .",
    "( 2008 ) , and the photometric membership techniques are described in detail in pello et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) and rudnick et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) . here",
    "we provide a brief summary of the techniques used in this paper .",
    "spectroscopic members are those with velocities within @xmath29 from the cluster redshift .",
    "spectroscopic membership information supercedes all photometric information .",
    "the photometric redshifts have been computed from the full optical / nir photometry and have been calibrated from the extensive ediscs spectroscopy to cull non - members , while retaining @xmath30 of all confirmed cluster members independent of rest - frame color , down to the spectroscopic magnitude selection limit , which was @xmath31 depending on the cluster .",
    "the photometric redshifts only yield robust membership classifications when optical and nir data are present , and so we limit our sample to those areas of each field with adequate exposure in all bands .    to test the reliability of our photometric redshifts for the ir - selected galaxies in our sample , we compare the completeness and the contamination of the photometric membership for ir and non - ir detected galaxies using our extensive spectroscopy .",
    "we define the completeness as the number of spectroscopic members that are also photometric redshift members , divided by the number of spectroscopic members .",
    "we find a completeness of @xmath32 .",
    "for the subsample of spectroscopic members that are also 24@xmath33 sources , we find a completeness of @xmath34 .",
    "we define contamination as the number of spectroscopic non - members which are classified as photometric members , divided by the total number of spectroscopic members that are classified as photometric members .",
    "this yields a contamination of @xmath35 . for the subsample of spectroscopic members that are also 24@xmath33 sources ,",
    "we find a contamination of @xmath36 .",
    "thus , the completeness and contamination of the 24@xmath33 sources are entirely consistent with the optically selected cluster sample down to the spectroscopic magnitude limit .",
    "marcillac et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) also find that the accuracy of photometric redshifts for ir - selected galaxies in a @xmath37 cluster is the same as that for all cluster members .",
    "we use the dale & helou ( 2002 ) models to estimate total ir luminosity ( 3 - 1100 ) from 24  fluxes as a function of galaxy redshift . to first calculate the 24  luminosity , we multiply the 24  flux ( in jy ) by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the luminosity distance corresponding to the cluster redshift , and by @xmath40 , the central frequency of the 24  bandpass . we scale the 24  luminosity by the conversion found from the dale & helou ( 2002 ) templates corresponding to the cluster redshift to estimate l@xmath41 . according to the dale & helou ( 2002 ) templates ,",
    "the error associated with estimating the ir luminosity solely from the observed 24um flux varies with redshift ; for the redshift range spanned by the ediscs  clusters , the error ranges from a minimum of 5% at @xmath42 to a maximum of 22% at @xmath43 . finally , we divide l@xmath41  by the luminosity of the sun , where @xmath44 .",

    "furthermore , bell et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) estimate that @xmath45% of the total infrared luminosity density at @xmath46 is from sources with significant agn emission , and the contribution is likely much lower since the infrared luminosity in these galaxies may also arise from star formation ( see also robaina et  al .",
    "2009 for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "similarly , the bai et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) and marcillac et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) studies of clusters at similar redshifts to our sample find that only @xmath44 out of 66 ir - detected galaxies are unambiguously agn and argue that the rest of their galaxies are dominated by dusty starbursts . finally , geach et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) observe a sample of 12 galaxies that are members of a @xmath47 cluster with the infrared spectrograph ( irs ; houck et  al .",
    "the results of the irs analysis indicate that the mid - ir emission for 11 of 12 galaxies is powered by a starburst rather than agn . based on these results ,",
    "we conclude that contamination by agn is likely to be small .",
    "we use the relation from kennicutt ( 1998 ) to convert from l@xmath41   ( 8 - 1000 ) to sfr .",
    "there is a slight discrepancy between the definition of l@xmath41  used by the dale & helou ( 2002 ) models ( 3 - 1100 ) and that used in the kennicutt star - formation conversion ( 8 - 1000 ) , but this impacts the inferred sfr by less than 5% ( d. dale 2009 , private communication ) .",
    "when we translate the 80% completeness flux limits listed in table [ detect ] to ir luminosities , we find that we do not probe as deeply in the higher - redshift clusters .",
    "cl1216 and cl1353 have the highest 80% completeness luminosities of @xmath48 , which corresponds to an ir - derived sfr of @xmath49  @xmath50 .",
    "this is just slightly below the luminosity of luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ; @xmath51 ) ( sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "therefore , we are sampling the population of luminous infrared galaxies rather than normal star - forming galaxies uniformly across the redshift range .",
    "because our l@xmath41  limit is so close to the lirg limit and given the uncertainties in computing l@xmath41  solely from observed 24  flux , we refer to our ir galaxies as lirgs .",
    "discrimination among cluster - specific processes that might affect the gas content of member galaxies requires a comparison between the star - formation properties of cluster and field galaxies .",
    "the galaxy evolution from morphology and seds project ( gems ; rix et  al .",

    "in addition , the differences that we measure are detected with higher significance according to a k - s test ( @xmath90 versus @xmath91 ) .",
    "this is likely due to the larger sample size used in this study which we obtain by including the photometric cluster members as well as the spectroscopic cluster members .      to probe the spatial distribution of the ir galaxies , we calculate the fraction of 24-emitting members as a function of projected radius from the cluster center .",

    ", we characterize the star - forming activity of the clusters in three ways : the fraction of 24-emitting galaxies , the average l@xmath41  of the 24  galaxies , and the total l@xmath41  averaged over all cluster members .",
    "these quantities are shown in the top , middle , and bottom panels of figure [ fracirevol ] , respectively , versus cluster redshift ( left ) and velocity dispersion ( right ) .",
    "we calculate the number of ir galaxies and the total ir luminosity per cluster using only those galaxies with @xmath3 and @xmath61 , and we normalize by the total number of cluster galaxies with @xmath3 ( @xmath93 ) . note that we also calculate the various measures of star - formation activity using an evolving @xmath94 limit as done in poggianti et  al .",
    "( 2008 ) . specifically , we vary the @xmath94 cut from @xmath95 at @xmath43 to @xmath96 at @xmath97 to account for passive evolution .",
    "the results are not significantly impacted by the evolving magnitude cut , so we adopt a constant magnitude limit of @xmath3 .",
    "we limit the analysis to galaxies that have a projected cluster - centric radius less than @xmath9 , where @xmath9  is the radius inside which the enclosed density is 200 times the critical density and approximates the virial radius of the cluster .",
    "the relationship between @xmath9  and velocity dispersion is shown in equation [ rtwoeqn ] below   assumes the line - of - sight velocity dispersion is related to the circular velocity by @xmath98 rather than @xmath99 as one would expect if galaxies are orbiting isotropically in a single isothermal sphere ( finn et  al .",
    "nevertheless , we adopt this @xmath100 scaling between @xmath101 and @xmath102 for consistency with previous ediscs  publications and note that our value of @xmath9  is roughly 20% higher as a result . ] , and we refer the reader to finn et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) for a complete derivation of this relationship .",
    "we show the three measures of star - formation activity in figure [ fracirevol ] .",
    "the corresponding quantities for the gems galaxies ( gray triangles and lines ) are calculated using the same magnitude and l@xmath41  cuts that were applied to the cluster galaxies .",
    "one main result from this figure is that the fraction of ir cluster galaxies lies significantly below that of the field , consistent with previous studies ( e.g. , tran et  al .",
    "2009 ) ; the overall fraction of ir emitting galaxies is @xmath104% for the cluster sample and @xmath105% for the @xmath14 gems sample .",
    "furthermore , all three measures of star - formation activity show that the higher - redshift clusters have a higher level of star - formation activity than the lower - redshift clusters .",
    "the fraction of ir galaxies shows the most significant correlation ( @xmath106 ) versus redshift as indicated by a spearman rank test .",
    "the right panels of figure [ fracirevol ] show that lirg activity is not correlated with cluster velocity dispersion .",
    "note that we are probing only the most actively star - forming galaxies ; poggianti et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) find that star - formation properties of less active galaxies do depend on cluster mass .    if we split the cluster sample into two redshift bins , we are able to detect redshift - evolution with higher statistical significance . for example , the average fraction of lirgs within @xmath9  is @xmath107% for the @xmath66 clusters and @xmath108% for the @xmath65 clusters . if we split the field sample at @xmath64 , we find that the fraction of gems lirgs drops from @xmath109 to @xmath110% .",
    "the conclusion then is that the higher - redshift galaxies in all environments have a higher fraction of lirgs and the amount of obscured star formation declines significantly over the 2.4 gyr timeline spanned by the ediscs   clusters .",
    "in addition , the ir fraction declines by a factor of 2.25@xmath111 in the clusters and 2.25@xmath112 in the field .",
    "the cluster and field decline rates agree within the errors , and thus the rate at which the lirg population declines is not affected by the cluster environment .    in figure [ sffcolor ] , we compare the redshift - evolution of the lirg fraction of the blue and red galaxies separately . to calculate the fractions , we divide the number of blue lirgs by the total number of blue galaxies , and likewise for the red galaxies .",
    "the results for the blue galaxies are shown in the top panel . while a number of individual clusters ( small circles ) show a blue lirg fraction that exceeds the field value , when the data are binned to improve statistics , the resulting lirg fractions ( large circles ) among the blue cluster galaxies are consistent with the field values .",
    "the large cluster - to - cluster variations illustrate the need for large samples of clusters to accurately characterize star - formation activity in cluster environments ; observations of only one cluster might erroneously lead the observer to infer that clusters contain an excess of ir galaxies relative to the field .",
    "the evolution of the red lirg fraction is shown in the bottom panel , and the red cluster galaxies lies systematically below that of the field .",
    "the difference between the cluster and field red lirg fractions is large .",
    "the low fraction of red cluster lirgs is due in part to the higher overall fraction of red galaxies in clusters , meaning the number of red lirgs is normalized by a larger number of red galaxies .",
    "however , this does not fully account for the difference , and we will further investigate the differences in the red cluster / field populations in a future paper .",

    "while coma and abell 3266 are more massive than the ediscs  clusters and thus might not be a fair baseline because of this mass mismatch , we find no dependence of the lirg fraction on cluster velocity dispersion within the ediscs  sample , and so we proceed with the comparison . in figure [ sfrdecline ]",
    "we show the fraction of lirgs versus lookback time for the ediscs  and local clusters .",
    "the dashed line shows an exponential with an e - folding time of 2.2  gyr . while this is by no means a unique fit to the data ,",
    "it does show that the drop in lirg fraction is consistent with an exponential decline . in their study of eight massive @xmath114 clusters , saintonge et  al .",

    ", we show two curves with the field data that depict two different evolutionary scenarios .",
    "the first curve ( dot - dashed line ) is the same function as for the clusters , but the decline in the field is delayed by 0.9 gyr with respect to the clusters .",
    "the second curve ( dashed line ) shows the field lirg population declining at a faster rate than the cluster lirgs ; this model produces the same behavior over the epoch probed by the gems galaxies but predicts fewer lirgs in local field environments . a low - redshift baseline is needed to constrain the decline rate of field lirgs .",
    "comparison with previous ediscs  studies suggests that lirgs decline at a faster rate than normal star - forming galaxies . in a study comparing three @xmath66 ediscs  clusters to a large sample of sdss clusters , finn et  al .",

    ". 2007 , 2009 ) suggest that the fraction of lirgs has decreased by a factor of @xmath4100 during the same time period .",
    "this disparity in evolution rates is likely due to the systematic decline in star - formation activity of all star - forming galaxies .",
    "for example , if we assume that the ir luminosity of all galaxies is fading at the same rate , then the ir luminosity function will shift systematically to lower luminosities with decreasing redshift ( e.g. le floch et  al . 2005 ) .",
    "the most actively star - forming galaxies - the ones we detect in the ediscs  clusters with _ spitzer _ - will not be present at lower redshift .",
    "in contrast , the number density of galaxies at lower ir luminosities does not change as dramatically .",
    "we will explore the evolution of the cluster ir luminosity function in more detail in a future paper .",
    "the morphs collaboration first termed the spectral class e(a ) to denote galaxies that show an a - star spectrum with emission lines ( dressler et  al . 1999 ; poggianti et  al .",

    "furthermore , of the lirgs that have existing optical spectroscopy , roughly three - quarters exhibit e(a ) spectra .",
    "finally , e(a ) galaxies are found least frequently in the centers of clusters .",
    "again , this is entirely consistent with the environmental dependence we find for lirgs .",

    "the median ratio of sfrs derived 24  emission with dust - corrected sfrs derived from [ oii ] is 2.9 ( vulcani et  al . 2010 ) .",
    "the large ratio of ir to optical sfrs is not surprising given the high sfrs of the ir galaxies ( e.g. zheng et  al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "some galaxy evolution models predict a cluster - induced burst of star formation as a galaxy falls into a cluster for the first time and the interstellar medium is compressed by the intra - cluster medium ( e.g. , bekki & couch 2003 ) .",
    "we find no evidence that clusters contain an overabundance of lirgs relative to the field , at least within @xmath9 .",

    "( 2007 ) and bai et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) conclude that lirgs occur more frequently in clusters",
    ". however , these authors use the surface density of lirgs to quantify density without normalizing by the total number of cluster galaxies .",
    "thus , their inferred overdensity of lirgs relative to the field is likely due to the fact that the surface density of all galaxies is higher in the vicinity of the cluster .",
    "in addition , as shown in figure [ fracirevol ] , cluster - to - cluster variations are large , and thus large samples of clusters are needed to accurately quantify the star - formation properties of clusters .      the sfrs of both field and cluster galaxies have declined dramatically since @xmath118 , and we have yet to address the possible mechanisms that can shut off star formation in these galaxies .",
    "this brings us full - circle to the goals outlined in  [ intro ] .    before proceeding we note that different mechanisms may be responsible for the star - formation and morphological transformations in clusters .",
    "we know that between the epoch of the ediscs  clusters and the present universe , the fraction of cluster spirals declines while the population of s0s increases .",
    "desai et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) find no significant change in s0 fraction within ediscs  sample , but we observe a decline in sfrs .",
    "this implies sfrs are changing faster than morphologies , and in fact the sf and morphology evolution might be driven by two different mechanisms .",
    "this supports results of other cluster studies ( poggianti et  al .",
    "1999 , 2006 ; snchez - blzquez et  al . 2009",
    "; geach et  al .",
    "2009 ) . in the remainder of this subsection , we focus solely on the processes that may be affecting star - formation rates .    from our observations , we are able to place constraints on the mechanism(s ) responsible for the decline of luminous ir galaxies .",
    "we see a decline in the fraction of lirgs in both the cluster and field samples , and the rate of the decline is the same for both samples .",
    "furthermore , the l@xmath41  distribution is the same for the field and cluster galaxies , but the fraction of lirgs is lower in the clusters , similar to results for local clusters",
    "( e.g. balogh et  al . 2004 ; tanaka et  al . 2004 ; rines et  al .",
    "2005 ; finn et  al .",
    "2008 ) . finally , the stellar masses of the cluster lirgs are on average higher than their field counterparts .",
    "one possible mechanism that can account for the similar evolution of field and cluster galaxies is gas depletion , where galaxies are not able to replenish their disk gas and have slowly declining star formation histories from using their available gas .",
    "the cluster environment would then have a lower fraction of star - forming galaxies because the cluster galaxies are further evolved .",
    "figure [ sfrdecline ] shows one plausible scenario where the decline in field lirgs mirrors the decline in cluster lirgs , but the field evolution is delayed by @xmath119gyr .",
    "this scenario can also explain the higher stellar masses seen in the cluster lirgs .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ lirstellmassredblue ] shows that sfr and stellar mass are correlated in the sense that more massive galaxies have higher sfrs .",
    "as gas depletion progresses , the sfrs of all galaxies decrease , and lirg - levels of star - formation would remain only in the most massive galaxies . in our scenario ,",
    "gas depletion is more advanced in the cluster environment , and thus one would also expect the host galaxies of lirgs to be more massive .    there is evidence that clusters affect the sfrs of some in - falling galaxies .",
    "for example , poggianti et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) and poggianti et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) find an excess of post - starburst galaxies in the ediscs  clusters relative to the coeval field .",
    "these galaxies have had their star formation quenched abruptly within 1  gyr prior to observation , and their excess relative to the field indicates that cluster - specific processes are altering the star - formation properties of some infalling galaxies .",
    "the excess of post - starburst galaxies in clusters is small , and we do nt have a large enough sample to detect a small differential evolution between the cluster and field lirg fraction .",
    "rudnick et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) provide further evidence that clusters are actively altering infalling galaxies ; they find that the red sequence appears to build up more rapidly in clusters than in the field .",
    "in addition , de lucia et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) find that the rate at which the red sequence builds up depends weakly on cluster velocity dispersion , although the interpretation of the observational findings depends on assumptions regarding the nature of the underlying mass / luminosity function of galaxies in various environments .",
    "we present _ spitzer _ mips observations of 16 @xmath120 ediscs  clusters .",
    "this is the first large 24-survey of clusters at intermediate redshift and represents a significant increase in the census of star - formation rates in dense environments .",
    "the limits of the 24  imaging are such that we are sensitive to only the brightest ir galaxies , and so our sample contains mainly lirgs rather than normal star - forming galaxies .",
    "our major results are summarized below .",
    "* we calculate l@xmath41  for the clusters members and compare to a large sample of coeval field galaxies from the literature . while the clusters contain a lower fraction of ir - emitting galaxies , the distribution of l@xmath41  for the cluster galaxies is identical to that of the field galaxies .",
    "* the stellar masses of the ediscs  lirgs are systematically higher than the stellar masses of the gems galaxies .",
    "* approximately @xmath480% of the ir galaxies live in the blue cloud and the remaining 20% lie on the red sequence .",
    "* the majority of lirgs have optical spectra that are dominated by a - stars and show some signs of modest on - going star formation as determined by [ o  ii ] emission ( i.e. e(a ) ; poggianti et  al .",
    "1999 , 2008 ) .",
    "sfrs derived from ir emission are much greater than those inferred from optical emission , with a median @xmath121 of 2.9 ( vulcani et  al .",
    "* lirgs avoid the centers of clusters ; the fraction of ir galaxies is lowest near the cluster center ( @xmath122@xmath9 ) and remains below the field value at least out to @xmath123@xmath9 . *",
    "the fraction of ir galaxies decreases significantly over the 2.4  gyr interval spanned by our sample , and the rate of the decline is the same for the cluster and field populations .",

    "* star - formation rates are declining faster than morphologies are transforming , consistent with numerous previous studies . * the similar decline of field and cluster lirgs suggests that the mechanism driving the global decline of sfrs is the same in the cluster and field environments .",
