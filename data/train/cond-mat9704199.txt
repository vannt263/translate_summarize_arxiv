    "recent theoretical and experimental studies@xcite of large fluctuations in stochastic systems driven by white gaussian noise have shown that among the different fluctuation paths of the system , the most probable _ optimal _ fluctuation path plays a crucial role .",
    "this is true for large output fluctuations , since the probability of encountering such fluctuations peaks sharply at the deterministic optimal fluctuation trajectory driven by an optimal realization from the random noise bath .",
    "the most probable fluctuation path , which we will call the stationary optimal path ( sop ) , is the optimal trajectory @xmath0 that brings the system to a given point @xmath1 of the phase space at instant @xmath2 from the vicinity of the initial attractor @xmath3 , where the system has been fluctuating for a long period of time prior to reaching the point @xmath1.the concept of sop can be traced back to the work of onsager - machlup@xcite and has been further widely used ( see e.g. , ref.@xcite ) .    in particular , the sop determines the quasistationary probability density @xmath4 , referenced to the local equilibrium point @xmath3 , that system is located at point @xmath1 under the condition that it never left the region of attraction to @xmath3 .",
    "another quantity of interest is the transition probability density @xmath5 for the system to be at point @xmath1 at @xmath2 given that it was at @xmath6 at time @xmath7 .",
    "it follows that @xmath8 for @xmath9 provided @xmath6 belongs to the domain of attraction to @xmath3 .    the distribution of different paths for a nonlinear double well potential has been investigated@xcite through consideration of the so called _ prehistory _ probability density @xmath10 , that is a conditional probability that system will be brought to final point @xmath1 at @xmath2 from the vicinity of the equilibrium position @xmath3 via the point @xmath6 at intermediate instant @xmath7 .",
    "using the fact that the prehistory probability density reaches its maximum on the sop ending at @xmath1 , then @xmath11 has been represented as a power series with respect to the deviation of @xmath6 from the optimal path .",
    "the first term in this series is responsible for the gaussian behavior of the @xmath10 near its maximum .",
    "it is apparent that , the the validity of power series expansion requires that the deviation of @xmath6 from the sop be sufficiently small .",
    "until now there were no attempts to calculate the prehistory probability density outside of the gaussian domain .",
    "the region where one can observe the deviation of @xmath10 from the universal gaussian form is most interesting since it reflects the specificity of the particular system .    motivated by the fact that the deviation of @xmath10 from the gaussian form has been observed in experiments@xcite , in this paper we have performed an analysis of the prehistory probability density for a broad range of initial positions @xmath6 outside the vicinity of the sop .",
    "this approach is based on the calculation of `` nonstationary optimal paths '' , which we call the nonstationary optimal trajectories that maximize the value of the transition probability considered as a functional of different paths starting at point @xmath6 at time @xmath12 and ending at point @xmath1 at time @xmath13 .",
    "we will show below that the nonstationary optimal path formalism naturally allows for calculation of the highly non - gaussian tails of the prehistory probability density appearing in nonlinear systems .",
    "we will consider a one dimensional stochastic system as it has been the subject of modeling in analog experiments@xcite described by the equation ( dimensionless units )    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the deterministic force induced by the nonlinear double well potential    @xmath16    and @xmath17 is random gaussian white noise with the correlation function    @xmath18    in order to calculate the transition probabilities we make use of feynman s notion@xcite of relating the probability functional @xmath19 $ ] of the system output fluctuations and the probability functional @xmath20 $ ] of the input noise . for gaussian noise the probability functional @xmath20 $ ] is given by    @xmath21 \\propto \\exp[-{1 \\over 2 d } \\int_{t_0}^{t_f } dt f(t)^2 ]   \\label{eq : ns3}\\ ] ]    one can see from eq.([eq : ns3 ] ) that @xmath22 $ ] , and hence @xmath19 $ ] , reaches its maximum for the most probable _ optimal _ random field @xmath23 , introduced in ref.@xcite , which minimizes the integral @xmath24 under the constraint that the equation of motion , eq.([eq : ns1 ] ) , is satisfied and @xmath25 .",
    "such a constraint leads to a nonzero value of the optimal noise field @xmath26 which would be zero without constraints .",
    "we will assume that points @xmath6 and @xmath1 belong to the region of attraction of the same attractor including any small vicinity of the separatrix .",

    "the validity of eqs.([eq : ns6]),([eq : s ] ) corresponds to the limit of low noise intensity for which @xmath35 .",

    "note that in the general case with a nonlinear dependence of @xmath15 on @xmath47 , the solution of eq.([eq : ns7 ] ) can not be presented as a linear combination of the partial solutions .",
    "the nonstationary optimal paths for the potential given by eq.([eq : pot ] ) have been found by numerical integration of eq.([eq : ns7 ] ) subject to boundary conditions , eq.([eq : ns8 ] )",
    ". the two point boundary value problem has been reexpressed by considering the problem with initial conditions @xmath48 .",
    "a minimization procedure has been employed in order to find the best value of the initial velocity @xmath49 to reach the target point @xmath50 at @xmath2 . as a test for the calculations the energy conservation law in eq.([eq : h ] ) has been verified for each trajectory obtained .    in figs.1a and 2a",
    "we illustrate the typical nonstationary optimal paths corresponding to @xmath51 for different values of @xmath6 and @xmath52 . for comparison",
    "we show also the sop , given by eq.([eq : inst ] ) ( for @xmath51 the constant c=99 in eq.([eq : inst ] ) ) .",
    "as one can see from fig.2a , the essential feature of the nonstationary optimal trajectories starting at @xmath53 is the possibility of a sign change of the velocity @xmath54 at an intermediate point of the trajectory",
    ". for small values of @xmath55 nonstationary optimal trajectories deviate significantly from the sop , whereas for asymptotically large @xmath55 they rapidly approach the sop independently of the initial point @xmath6 .",
    "this behavior can also be understood from the exact solution of eq.([eq : ns7 ] ) for the harmonic potential presented in the next section .    with the use of eq.([eq : ns1 ] ) and the known temporal form of the nonstationary trajectories one can reproduce the corresponding values of the optimal noise field .",
    "the values of @xmath56 for the trajectories shown in figs.1a and 2a are presented in figs.1b and 2b .    in the next section the approach",
    "above will be used for the calculation of the prehistory probability density for a broad range of initial positions @xmath6 .",

    "thus we may write    @xmath62    and with eq.([eq : ns4 ] ) , eq.([eq : int1 ] ) we arrive at    @xmath63    the difference between @xmath10 and @xmath5 is that @xmath10 satisfies the normalization condition with respect to initial points @xmath6 ( @xmath64 ) whereas @xmath5 satisfies the analogous normalization condition with respect to final points @xmath1 .",
    "eq.([eq : ns4 ] ) shows that if @xmath6 belongs to the stationary optimal path ending at @xmath1 , then both integrals in eq.([eq : ns4 ] ) are equal and cancel meaning that @xmath65 reaches its maximum on the stationary optimal path @xcite .",

    "then the prehistory probability density should obey the backward kolmogorov equation and , in fact , does not depend on the prehistory .",
    "below we will illustrate this conclusion , which is a consequence of the chosen quasiequilibrium value of the initial distribution , on the model system with a quasiharmonic potential . in the general case",
    "the prehistory probability density does depend on prehistory in multistable stochastic systems .",
    "note also that being consistent with the concept of optimal fluctuation we assume that @xmath67 ( a particle is `` climbing uphill '' ) resulting in occasional fluctuations described by the prehistory probability density .",
    "in refs.@xcite the partial solution , eq.([eq : ns9 ] ) has been used for the evaluation of the prehistory probability density based on the iterative solution of eq.([eq : ns7 ] ) near the sop implying that the values of @xmath68 are not too large .",
    "we stress , however , that using the formalism above , the prehistory probability density as well as the transition probabilities can be evaluated without the limitation on the values of @xmath68 .    prior",
    "to concentrating on the results of numerical calculations for the case of the nonlinear potential , eq.([eq : pot ] ) , we will present for illustration the simple expressions for @xmath5 and @xmath10 with the quasiharmonic potential of the form    @xmath69    in this case the solution of eq.([eq : ns7 ] ) can be obtained analytically .",

    "note that the prehistory probability density given by eq.([eq : ns14 ] ) obeys the backward kolmogorov equation@xcite .",
    "the prehistory probability density for the nonlinear potential given by eq.([eq : pot ] ) has been calculated numerically with the use of eq.([eq : ns4 ] ) .",
    "precaution is required , however , since near the sop the exponent in eq.([eq : ns4 ] ) becomes the small difference of large numbers . in order to improve the accuracy of the calculations",
    "we may represent the exponent of @xmath10 in the form    @xmath79 +   \\int_{t_0}^{t_f } dt [ f_{opt}(t , x_0,x_f)^2 - f_{opt}^s(t , x_f)^2 ] \\label{eq : int2}\\ ] ]    one can see from eq.([eq : int2 ] ) that if @xmath6 belongs to the stationary optimal path ending at point @xmath1 at @xmath2 , then both integrands in eq.([eq : int2 ] vanish .",
    "the calculated values of @xmath80 are presented in fig.3 .",
    "it is seen that the parabolic character of the curves , and hence the gaussian character of prehistory probability density , takes place only in a small region in the vicinity of sop where the prehistory probability density reaches its maximum . in general , the function @xmath10 is highly asymmetrical , and that is the essential feature of the path distribution in nonlinear systems .",

    "the observed highly asymmetrical shape of the prehistory probability density is the essential feature of the fluctuations in nonlinear noise driven systems .",
