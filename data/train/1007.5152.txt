    "the existence of inflationary expansion era in the early universe is strongly motivated by cosmological observations  @xcite . on the other hand , supersymmetry ( susy )",

    "various inflation models based on susy or supergravity setup have been proposed so far , including hybrid inflation  @xcite , new inflation  @xcite and chaotic inflation  @xcite .",
    "another hint for the new physics beyond the standard model may be the smallness of the neutrino masses as measured by neutrino oscillation experiments and constrained cosmologically .",
    "the tiny neutrino masses are generated by integrating out heavy right - handed neutrinos through the see - saw mechanism  @xcite . in order to give heavy masses to right - handed neutrinos",
    ", we introduce the following superpotential @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the right - handed neutrino superfield with @xmath7 denoting the generation number @xmath8 , @xmath9 is a singlet under the standard model gauge group and @xmath10 is a coupling constant .",

    "if the scalar component of @xmath9 gets a large vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , the right - handed ( s)neutrinos obtain large masses , leading to tiny left - handed neutrino masses through the see - saw mechanism .",
    "the simplest superpotential for giving @xmath9 a large vev is the following , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a coupling constant , @xmath19 is a singlet field , and @xmath20 has a charge @xmath21 under @xmath11 . along with the @xmath22-term potential which enforces @xmath23 , the vacuum lies at @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and hence right - handed ( s)neutrinos obtain large masses .",
    "remarkably , the superpotential ( [ kspp ] ) exactly corresponds to that for hybrid inflation  @xcite , with @xmath19 identified as the inflaton and @xmath26 as the waterfall field .",
    "thus we are led to consider a susy hybrid inflation model . the hybrid inflation model in supergravity was studied in detail in refs .",

    "we reexamine the hybrid inflation model in various aspects and explore the parameter space where various constraints are satisfied , and discuss issues concerning fine - tuning of the initial condition for successful inflation . in particular , we focus on the effect of a constant term in the superpotential on the inflaton dynamics , which is required for making the cosmological constant zero . while earlier works  @xcite focused on the limited parameter range , we consider both minimal and non - minimal khler potentials with wide range of the gravitino mass",
    ". we also explicitly show which parameter regions suffer from the fine - tuning of the initial condition .",
    "moreover , we take into account the non - thermal gravitino production from inflaton decay  @xcite , which places an extremely tight constraint on the inflation model parameters for an unstable tev - scale gravitino , allowing only the gravitino mass either heavier than @xmath27tev or lighter than @xmath28gev .",
    "interestingly , as demonstrated in the following sections , the inclusion of the constant term in the superpotential gives tight and complementary constraints for the heavier gravitino , which , together with the gravitino constraint , gives a clear preference to a light gravitino .",

    "thus the required tuning on the initial position @xmath58 becomes weaker for large @xmath33 .",
    "* however , the heavy gravitino tends to induce larger angular motion of the inflaton , and it may drive the inflaton toward the local minimum lying at @xmath64 .",

    "importantly , the gravitino abundance is inversely proportional to the reheating temperature , in contrast to the thermal scattering ( [ thy ] ) .",
    "therefore , the non - thermal gravitino production gives a tight constraint on the inflation models , when combined with the thermal scattering production .",

    "we take @xmath153 for the sake of concreteness , but this choice does not much affect the results . as can be seen from the above expressions , more gravitinos are produced for a larger inflaton vev and a heavier inflaton mass . therefore a high - scale inflation model tends to be disfavored by the inflaton - induced gravitino problem .",

    "the initial angle of the inflaton is chosen to be @xmath168 so that the angular motion is not induced by the linear term .",
    "the meanings of lines are same as the top panels .",
    "the purple shaded region is excluded for @xmath170 , since inflation does not occur , i.e. , @xmath176 . for comparison ,",
    "we have also shown the region where inflation does not occur for the case of @xmath177 by the purple dotted line ; the region below the line is excluded .",
    "it should be noted that in the non - shaded region , some amount of fine - tuning concerning the initial position of the inflaton is necessary in the sense of sec .",
    "[ sec : tune ] ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : tune_1gev ] and [ fig : tune_1tev ] ) .",
    "there remains a consistent parameter region for relatively large @xmath181 for @xmath182  gev . around this region ,",
    "the scalar spectral index is close to 0.96 because of the @xmath69-term in the scalar potential , and hence the fit to the observation is better .",
    "let us focus on the two constraints : the gravitino problem and the effect of the linear term . as emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite , the gravitino problem , especially when non - thermal production is taken into account , excludes quite a few number of inflation models in the gravity mediation .",
    "so , the gravitino problem suggests that the gravitino mass is either heavy ( @xmath183tev ) or light ( @xmath184gev ) , for which the cosmological effect of the gravitino is mild . indeed , in the case of the hybrid inflation model , there are allowed regions for heavy or light gravitinos , where the inflaton mass is lighter than about @xmath185 .",
    "in other words , one could avoid the gravitino bound if @xmath18 and/or @xmath40 is small enough .",
    "however , the effect of the linear term was not taken into account in the above analysis .",
    "the linear term is more important for a heavier gravitino , as one can see from the figures that the gray shaded ( bottom - left corner ) regions become larger for a heavier gravitino . in particular , the black dashed lines ,",
    "on which the density perturbation of the right magnitude would be generated for @xmath186 , are significantly modified to the solid lines , especially for @xmath187tev .",
    "this is because , due to the additional tilt induced by the linear term , the inflation scale must be larger to generate the density perturbation with the same magnitude ( see eq .  ( [ norm ] ) ) .",
    "such modification of the parameters produce a tension with the gravitino problem especially for a heavy gravitino .",
    "thus , we conclude that , combining the gravitino problem and the effect of the linear term , a light gravitino is preferred in the hybrid inflation model .",
    "finally let us consider the possibility that the inflaton decays into right - handed neutrinos through the interaction ( [ pnn ] ) and subsequent decay of the right - handed neutrinos generates a lepton asymmetry , which is transformed into a baryon asymmetry through the sphaleron process  @xcite .",
    "the abundance of the right - handed neutrino , @xmath188 , produced non - thermally by the inflaton decay , is given by  , for simplicity .",
    "this can be justified by demanding @xmath189 and @xmath190 heavier than the inflaton and not produced by the inflaton decay . ]",
    "@xmath191 where @xmath192 is the branching ratio of the inflaton decay into @xmath188 pair .",
    "we assume the mass of @xmath188 is larger than the reheating temperature : @xmath193 . in this case",
    ", the right - handed neutrinos are not thermalized after inflation and we do not need to take account of the wash - out effects of the lepton asymmetry .",
    "the cp - asymmetric decay of @xmath188 produces net baryon number after sphaleron process , given by  @xcite @xmath194 where @xmath195 is an @xmath196 parameter which represents the effective cp phase .",
    "here we have assumed that the right - handed neutrino decays immediately after the inflaton decay . this",
    "is justified unless the right - handed neutrino is extremely lighter than the inflaton .    in the present model , @xmath156 and @xmath197 . in order for the inflaton decay into @xmath188 s to be kinematically accessible ,",
    "@xmath198 is imposed .",
    "we can always take @xmath199 to be not so far from @xmath18 , so that the produced baryon number is not suppressed ( eq .",
    "( [ baryon ] ) ) .",
    "after inflation , the scalar fields @xmath19 and @xmath200 have same masses @xmath156 and they are maximally mixed with each other @xcite .",
    "the decay rate of @xmath201 into two @xmath188 s is given by @xmath202 the decay rate of @xmath19 into sneutrinos , @xmath203 , is almost the same @xcite .",
    "assuming these are the dominant decay process of the inflaton ( @xmath204 ) , the reheating temperature is estimated as @xmath205 this can not be much larger because of the gravitino problem . on the other hand , as is clear from eq .",
    "( [ baryon ] ) , @xmath206  gev is required for reproducing the observed amount of baryon asymmetry of the universe even for @xmath207 .",
    "in the case of gauge mediation , thermal gravitino production implies @xmath208mev from @xmath209gev for successful leptogenesis .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig:1gev ] that there is a parameter region where the non - thermal leptogenesis works .",
    "for instance , in the case of the minimal khler potential , we find that @xmath210 , @xmath211gev and @xmath212 are viable parameter choice for @xmath111  gev ( see top panel of fig .  [ fig:1gev ] ) . in the case of gravity mediation where @xmath187gev @xmath213tev , the upper bound on the reheating temperature reads @xmath214  gev .",
    "thus we need @xmath207 for correct amount of baryon asymmetry ( [ baryon ] ) . comparing it with eq .",
    "( [ tr ] ) , smaller @xmath215 or @xmath216  gev ) is required , but this is not compatible with the density perturbation condition ( see the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:1tev ] ) . in the non - minimal khler case ,",
    "the situation becomes worse ( see the bottom panel of fig .  [ fig:1tev ] ) .    in the case of anomaly - mediation",
    "where @xmath217  tev , the upper bound on the reheating temperature is loosened as @xmath218  gev . on the other hand , rather large @xmath18 and @xmath40",
    "is needed for satisfying the density perturbation condition ( see the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:1000tev ] ) .",
    "for instance , in the case of the minimal khler potential , we find @xmath181 , @xmath219 and @xmath220 can satisfy the bound on the reheating temperature .",
    "the situation is similar in the non - minimal khler case ( see the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:1000tev ] ) .",
    "we have reexamined the hybrid inflation model in supergravity , and searched for a viable parameter region , particularly taking account of the non - thermal gravitino production and the effect of the linear term in the superpotential .",
    "we have found that the effect of the linear term on the inflaton dynamics as well as the fine - tuning of the initial condition becomes significant for a heavy gravitino mass , giving a clear preference to a light gravitino .",
    "importantly , this constraint disfavors a heavy gravitino ( @xmath221tev ) , which is otherwise allowed by the gravitino problem .",
    "remember that the non - thermal gravitino production restricts the inflation model parameters especially for unstable weak - scale gravitino , allowing for either heavy or light gravitino . in either case",
    ", it is likely that the predicted tension of the cosmic string is close to the present upper bound , and may be within the reach of future detection .",
    "we also confirmed that the non - thermal leptogenesis could work for @xmath222mev @xmath213gev , and @xmath223tev . for @xmath224ev  @xcite",
    ", there is no upper bound on the reheating temperature , and so , thermal leptogenesis is possible .    in order to avoid the above tight constraints on the heavy gravitino , we need some extension or non - trivial cosmological assumptions : entropy production to dilute the gravitino , curvaton for producing the density perturbation , etc .",
    "some comments are in order . in this paper",
    "we have concentrated on the hybrid inflation model in supergravity .",
    "one may wonder whether the constant term in the superpotential has drastic effects on inflationary dynamics or not in other inflation models . in the new inflation model with superpotential @xmath225  @xcite",
    "we do not need to add a constant term in the superpotential : it is automatically generated after inflation ends and the inflaton relaxes to the potential minimum . in the variant type of new inflation model like @xmath226  @xcite , where @xmath227 takes a roll of the inflaton",
    ", the constant term should be added in order to make sure that the cosmological constant is almost zero in the present universe . in this case , under a reasonable assumption , the @xmath58 field settles at the origin @xmath228 during inflation , and hence all the terms in the scalar potential which are included by the constant term are highly suppressed .",
    "hence we expect no drastic effect of the constant term in the superpotential . in the chaotic inflation model in ref .",
    "@xcite , a superpotential of @xmath229 is introduced , where @xmath58 denotes the inflaton and @xmath230 is another superfield .",
    "also in this case @xmath230 is settled to zero during inflation and the constant term in the superpotential does not have important effects .",
