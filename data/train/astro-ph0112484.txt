    "x - ray studies of millisecond pulsars ( msps ) can constrain fundamental properties of their emission regions and , when combined with radio timing studies , their underlying neutron stars ( nss ) . in globular clusters",
    "both msps and low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , their likely progenitors , are significantly enhanced ( per unit mass ) over their values in the galactic disk by stellar and binary interactions .",
    "the dense cluster ( core ) environment needed for their excess formation may also alter their evolution . thus cluster vs. field msps , as studied in x - rays and radio , can constrain intrinsic vs. extrinsic ( evolutionary ) properties of these oldest ns systems .",
    "we have conducted a deep _ chandra _",
    "survey for msps as well as quiescent lmxbs and cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) in the globular clusters 47  tuc ( grindlay et al . 2001a ; ghe01a ) and ngc  6397 ( grindlay et al . 2001b ; ghe01b ) .",
    "the full details of the msp survey are given in grindlay et al .",
    "( 2001c ; gch01 ) . here",
    "we present the highlights of this study , focusing on just the x - ray properties of the 16 msps with radio timing positions in 47  tuc ( freire et al .",
    "2001a , freire 2001 ) and the one in ngc  6397 ( damico et al .",
    "2001 ; dpm ) as well as their comparison with the field msp population ( cf . becker & trumper 1997 , 1999 ; bt97 , bt99 ) .",
    "we defer to the full paper the discussion of the total msp populations and spatial distributions , which probe cluster dynamics .",
    "the 47  tuc msps were found initially ( ghe01a ) to be soft sources . in gch01",
    "we give the detected counts in 3 bands : softcts ( 0.21kev ) , mediumcts ( 12kev ) and hardcts ( 28kev ) for each of the 14 resolved msps , with counts for 47  tuc - g and -i ( unresolved ) estimated . from these bands ,",
    "we form the hardness ratios hr1 = mediumcts / softcts and hr2 = hardcts / mediumcts and plot the msps , with counting statistics errors , in the color - color diagram shown in figure  1 ( left ) .",
    "the msp colors are clustered in a relatively narrow range of hr1 and hr2 with 47  tuc - j clearly harder , as was evident in the xcolor distributions in ghe01a .    using the pimms tool ,",
    "we construct values of hr1 and hr2 for 3 simple models : thermal bremsstrahlung ( tb ) , blackbody ( bb ) and power law ( pl ) , with index values ( kt or photon index ) given in the caption of figure  1 ( left ) .",
    "the observed range of hr1-hr2 is roughly consistent with tb spectra with kt 1kev , bb spectra with kt 0.20.3kev ( except for 47  tuc - j ) or pl spectra with photon index 3 .",
    "the weighted mean colors for all but 47  tuc - j are consistent with a bb spectrum with kt 0.22kev , giving x - ray luminosities ( 0.5 - 2.5kev ) 1 - 4 10@xmath0 erg  s^-1erg  s@xmath1 and thus mean bolometric l@xmath9 = 2.6 10@xmath0 erg  s^-1erg  s@xmath1 .",
    "the x - ray colors rule out tb models ( surrounding column densities inconsistent with the msp dispersion measures ; dm ) and pl fits ( spectral indices implausible ) .",
    "simple bb fits for l@xmath9 give emission radii of only 0.1 km whereas h ( or he)-atmosphere models ( rajagopal & romani 1996 ) typically give temperatures reduced ( from bb ) by a factor of 2 and thus radii increased to 0.4 km .",
    "either case suggests soft x - ray emission from a region smaller than the entire polar cap , as predicted in recent models of harding & muslimov ( 2001 ) for polar cap heating .",
    "although the 3.2s temporal resolution of _ chandra_-acis prevents a pulsation analysis , the small thermal emission area suggests the emission would be pulsed , with a sinusoidal pulse shape appropriate to the fractional visibility of the isotropically radiating thermal polar cap .",
    "in contrast , the narrower pulse duty cycles of 10% for some field msps ( and one in the globular cluster m28 ; bt99 ) are probably due to non - thermal beamed emission .",
    "a key question for this rich _ chandra _ dataset is the correlation of x - ray luminosity and pulsar spindown luminosity @xmath10 , which is found for field msps ( with much more uncertain distances ) to scale as ( 0.1 - 2.4kev ) 10@xmath7 ( bt97 ) and with a possibly steeper logarithmic slope ( 1.4 ) for in the 2 - 10kev band ( possenti et al .",
    "2001 ; pcc ) .",
    "we derive instrinsic period derivatives , @xmath11 , corrected for the cluster acceleration by estimating the 3d positions of each msp in the cluster from the observed dm value and the observed hot gas and thus electron density in the cluster ( freire et al .",
    "2001b ) and then subtracting the cluster acceleration using a king model with cluster parameters derived by meylan & mayor ( 1986 ) . using a standard ns moment of inertia @xmath12g@xmath13 , we then derive = @xmath14 for each msp and plot them vs. ( 0.5 - 2.5kev ) in figure  1 ( right ) .",
    "uncertainties in the values are typically 0.20.5 in the log but are not shown for clarity ; uncertainties in log(l@xmath15 ) are typically 0.2 , and extrapolating to the _ rosat _ band , 0.1 - 2.4kev , would increase log(l@xmath15 ) only by 0.1 . for comparison with 47  tuc",
    ", we plot the msp in ngc  6397 ( ghe01b ) , for which the uncertainty is small , and updated values ( cf .",
    "gch01 ) for the 10 field msps previously detected in x - rays as well as in the globular cluster m28 .",
    "whereas the msps in the field and m28 show ( figure 1 , right ) a correlation log(0.1 - 2.4kev ) = ( 1.13@xmath16)log- 7.5@xmath17 , the msps in 47  tuc appear to have a weaker dependence : log(0.5 - 2.5kev ) = ( @xmath18)log+ @xmath19 for the nominal cluster model with central velocity dispersion = 11.6kms@xmath1 , where the errors ( @xmath201@xmath21 ) in both correlations are due to just the scatter in the points .",
    "allowing for uncertainties in the cluster model and distance gives slope @xmath22 and intercept @xmath23 . including the errors for the values estimated for the 47  tuc msps , but with the approximation that unequal errors ( on @xmath10 ) are simply averaged ( which biases the slope to steeper values , since the unequal errors are much larger for smaller values of @xmath10 ) , increases the logarithmic slope to @xmath24 and offset to @xmath25 .",
    "the best ( median ) estimate for the 47  tuc msps alone is thus @xmath4 @xmath26 .",
    "apart from the uncertain detection of 47  tuc - c ( gch01 ) , the msps in 47  tuc have ( 0.52.5kev ) values within a factor of 4 despite a range of 25 in @xmath10 .",
    "figure 1 ( right ) shows that 6397-a , the msp in ngc  6397 , is consistent with the - correlation shown by the 47  tuc msps .",
    "including 6397-a in the fit yields @xmath27 ( scatter only ) or 0.55@xmath16 ( with averaged @xmath28 errors for the 47  tuc values ) .",
    "the smaller @xmath4 values for 47  tuc and ngc  6397 may be due to the different formation histories and possibly different physical parameters of their msps vs. the field objects . in figure  2 ( left )",
    "we plot vs. spindown ages , @xmath29 , for msps in the field ( and m28 ) vs. the 47  tuc and ngc  6397 sample .",
    "error bars on the age parameter are not shown , for clarity , but are typically @xmath30 in the log and primarily due to the 47  tuc acceleration model . despite the uncertainties ,",
    "the correlation is striking : the field msps show a declining with `` age , '' and the 47  tuc msps appear to fall on this trend but with a flatter vs. age slope .",
    "however , spindown ages correspond only approximately to actual ages , and while these estimates are consistent with the formation of most 47  tuc msps early in the cluster history , this would not by itself provide an explanation for the different vs. correlations found for msps in 47  tuc and ngc  6397 vs. the field .",
    "another possible physical difference between the 47  tuc and field msps might be magnetic field strength at the light cylinder ( at which the corotation speed equals @xmath31 ) , since this likely affects the relative importance of non - thermal ( magnetospheric ) emission . for an assumed dipole field , this is given by @xmath32 g , with @xmath33 in units of 10@xmath34 . in figure  2 ( right ) we plot vs. @xmath35 . again , considered as a homogeneous group , the msps in the field ( and m28 ) lie on a steeper slope than the 47  tuc msps . in support of the hypothesis that @xmath35 , rather than the field @xmath36 ( @xmath37)@xmath38 g at the ns surface , is more closely related to",
    "is the fact that the correlation of with @xmath39 is less defined and with larger scatter , and with logarithmic slopes differing even more : 0.05@xmath40 for the 47  tuc msps vs. 2.80@xmath41 for the field msps .",
    "we note that 3 out of the 4 msps with @xmath42 g display x - ray emission that is seemingly magnetospheric , with the nature of emission from the 4th ( the eclipsing msp b1957 + 20 ) indeterminate ( bt99 ; takahashi et al .",
    "conversely , field pulsars with @xmath43 g have x - ray emission that is typically either thermal or of indeterminate character ( bt99 ) .",
    "considering the small numbers of such pulsars studied , and that most of them have highly uncertain distances , it seems possible that field pulsars with @xmath44 g may show an l@xmath15@xmath35 trend that is fairly flat and roughly consistent with the better determined relation for the 47  tuc msps .",
    "however for this interpretation to hold , a few field msps with relatively well determined distances ( e.g. 0437@xmath454715 and 1744@xmath451134 ; cf .",
    "gch01 ) must be accounted for and the even larger deviations of 0751 + 1807 and 1024@xmath450719 from the 47  tuc correlation line would require factor 3 adjustments in these msp distances .",
    "the msps in 47  tuc are primarily very soft x - ray sources , consistent with thermal emission from the pulsar polar caps .",
    "the msps in both 47  tuc and ngc  6397 seem to have a less efficient conversion of rotational spindown energy ( @xmath10 ) into soft x - rays ( l@xmath15 ) than most field msps , even those with correspondingly low values of their magnetic field at the light cylinder . for @xmath2 @xmath3 ,",
    "the 47  tuc - ngc  6397 samples are fit by @xmath46 whereas the updated ( gch01 ) field ( and m28 ) sample are consistent with the value @xmath47 found previously ( bt97 ; pcc and references therein ) .",
    "the soft colors for the 47  tuc msps and the extended emission from 6397-a ( gch01 ) indicate a lack of beamed magnetospheric emission , which may suggest they have different @xmath35 values or configurations .",
    "we speculate their b fields may have a multipole field geometry ( and thus lower dipole component ) and be less efficient particle accelerators . unlike msps in the field , those in dense cluster cores have a possibility of being driven back into contact and an accretion phase , as a re - cycled lmxb ( from a msp ) !   renewed accretion ( and 6397-a is presently close to filling its roche lobe ; cf .",
    "dpm ) would likely continue the b - field burial process thought to be responsible ( e.g.  romani 1990 ) for field decay from the @xmath48 g fields at ns birth to the @xmath49 g values typical of msps .",
    "the 47  tuc msps have spent their @xmath50gyr lifetime in a dense ( @xmath51 ) cluster core , where they undergo scattering interactions with both single stars and other binaries .",
    "such scattering causes the binding energy @xmath52 of a hard binary to secularly increase .",
    "thus , while angular momentum transfer to the secondary acts to detach the binary , scattering events tend to drive it back toward contact .",
    "a complication in this picture is that since msps are extremely hard binaries , the secular increase in @xmath52 is largely the result of infrequent strong scattering events , which are likely to eject the binary from the cluster core or even the cluster .",
    "nevertheless , it appears plausible that a typical old ( @xmath50gyr ) msp in a _ dense _",
    "cluster core might undergo one or more msp - lmxb transformation cycles .",
    "thus a few percent of the msps at any one time may be in ( or near ) this recurrent lmxb phase .",
    "this might explain the puzzling luminous qlmxbs x5 and x7 ( ghe01a and heinke et al .",
    "2002 ) in 47  tuc : they might be recently ( @xmath53yr ) detached lmxbs , in which their underlying msp nature is hidden by their evaporating ( from msp - driven winds ? ) fossil disks , thus explaining their lack of any detectable low - level accretion signatures .",
    "the younger system in ngc  6397 has the advantages of having been recently scattered out of a still higher density ( 10@xmath54 pc@xmath7 ) core collapsed cluster core and possibly having exchanged its companion ( ferraro et al .",
    "2001 , ghe01b ) .",
    "either or both would likely have restored an accretion phase .",
    "thus 6397-a need not be just `` born , '' as suggested by ferraro et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ; it may instead have just been reborn .",
    "in contrast , the msp in m28 is both 10  younger , single and in a lower density core and so is unlikely to have gone through a renewed accretion phase ."
