    "monte carlo simulations are not only essential tools for the comparison of theory and experiment in physics , but also for the design and optimization of detectors . in these proceedings",
    ", we present preliminary simulation studies of time projection chambers ( tpcs ) , where the drift charge is amplified with gas electron multipliers ( gems ) and detected with pixel electronics .",
    "this tpc configuration is described in these proceedings of s. vahsen [ @xcite ] and also in [ @xcite ] .",
    "these technologies should allow improved gas - target detectors , where the ionization in the target gas is detected with low noise , good position and time resolution , and high efficiency .",
    "these features allow us to measure the momentum and energy of charged particles and indirectly of fast neutrons by measuring charged recoils procured when they scatter elastically off the nuclei of the gas - target .",
    "tpcs with gems and pixels may also allow dark matter searches with improved sensitivity and background rejection that exploit the predicted twelve - hour oscillation weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , which results from the earth s rotation [ @xcite,@xcite ] .",
    "we will present ongoing simulation studies , including first sensitivity - estimates for a directional dark matter detector ( d@xmath0 ) and a directional neutron observer ( dino ) based on these technologies .",
    "these proceedings are divided into four parts : the * simulation strategy * is introduced , the * preliminary simulation validation * of geant4 [ @xcite ] and of the wimp cross section limit code are discussed , the * design optimization * by varying the pressure and by using either the electron drift ( ed ) or the negative ion drift ( nid ) is presented , and finally the * preliminary results * are shown .",
    "the d@xmath0/dino monte carlo simulation toolkit is currently being assembled and will mostly rely on already available simulation programs : geant4 [ @xcite ] , srim [ @xcite ] and garfield [ @xcite ] ) .",
    "the flow chart in figure 1 shows the simulation steps expected , which will perform the following tasks :        * an event generator will simulate the signal and background sources . e.g. , for the wimp case : the predicted wimp velocity distribution for the signal and cosmic - ray - induced radiation and radiation emitted by detector material for the background . * an accurate geometry and materials description . * the interaction between the incoming particle and the target gas or / and detector materials",
    "will be modeled using either the geant4 [ @xcite ] physic classes , srim [ @xcite ] , or garfield [ @xcite ] , depending the particle type , which may lead to the creation of ionization along the trajectory of the incoming particle or / and along the recoil product of the incoming particle scattering off gas - nuclei .",
    "srim[@xcite ] and garfield[@xcite ] can model theses processes fairly well . *",
    "then the electrons [ @xcite ] ( or negative ions [ @xcite ] ) drift under the influence of the electric field .",
    "negative ions can be formed in the case the electrons from the ionization can attach themselves to the gas - molecule to form negative ions ) .",
    "garfield or a fast monte carlo simulation using the gas properties calculated by magboltz [ @xcite ] can simulate the drift of ionization ( electrons , or negative ions in the case of negative ion drift ) , towards the gems with a constant velocity in a homogeneous electric field .",
    "the gems which then amplify the signal . in an area of high field near the gems ,",
    "the electrons detach from the negative ion .",
    "therefore a normal avalanche occurs both in the case of electrons and negative ions .",
    "we plan to model the gems with a parameterized simulation .",

    "the probability of interaction between a neutron and the gas - target ( 50 cm length of iso - butane at 1 atm ) has been simulated as function of the neutron kinetic energy ( see figure 1 left ) with the transport code geant4 [ @xcite ] .",
    "this probability has also been calculated for 1-mev neutrons by using the low energy nuclear data ( lend ) [ @xcite ] .",
    "there is 0.11 @xmath1 per centimeter probability at 1 atm of 1-mev neutron interacting with a hydrogen atom belonging to the iso - butane - molecule .",
    "this analytical calculation is in good agreement with the geant4 [ @xcite ] calculation , which also uses the lend [ @xcite ] for the cross section values , and gives 0.114 @xmath1 per centimeter .",

    "a fair agreement is found , as illustrated by figure 2 ( right ) .",
    "the design optimization consists of finding the optimum pressure for a directional dark matter detector , d@xmath0 , when there is a good trade off between the target mass and track length so that the directional sensitivity is maximized .",
    "the volume is kept fixed by considering a detector with a one square meter readout plane and a maximum drift length of 33.33 cm .",
    "several conditions are imposed on the track to ensure that the projection of the track , with a length l , on the two - dimensionally segmented pixel chip readout plane can be exploited to extract the directionality :    * l @xmath2 3 @xmath3 where @xmath3 is the transverse diffusion * l @xmath2 3 @xmath4 gem holes spacing * energy threshold on the primary ionization energy of 1-kev that corresponds approximately to 40 electrons detected    an approximate quenching factor , estimated with srim , was also included .",

    "similarly , the townsend and attachment coefficients scale with the pressure . therefore if we decrease the pressure the transverse diffusion will get worse and the probability of being in a multiplication regime increases as well .",

    "if we decrease the pressure the track length increases .",
    "the figure of merit ( fom ) is given by the number of wimp recoils expected to result in a reconstructible track .",

    "the figure of merit can be written as :    @xmath13    where :    * @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the nucleus and the nucleon reduced mass , respectively * @xmath16 is the number of gas - molecules per cubic centimeter * v is the target gas volume * @xmath17 with @xmath18 the form factor as defined in [ @xcite ] and i = a@xmath6 for the spin independent case ( si ) or i @xmath19 j(j+1 ) for the spin dependent case ( sd ) * l is the track length and l@xmath20 is the track length `` threshold '' derived by the three conditions described above .",
    "l@xmath20 is not a constant and is changing for each pressure * p is the pressure * t@xmath21 is the kinetic energy of the recoil nucleus     ( left ) and cs@xmath5 ( right ) calculated respectively for 10 gev / c@xmath6 ( red , full line ) and 100 gev / c@xmath6 wimps ( black , dashed line which is scaled by factor 1350 for cf@xmath8 and 450 for cs@xmath5 ) . ]",
    "example distributions ( track length and recoil energy ) corresponding to the optimum pressures found for wimp masses of 10 gev / c@xmath6 and 100 gev / c@xmath6 , after the directionality conditions are applied , can be seen in figure 3 .",
    "figure 3 also shows the track length versus the drift distance and the angle between the incoming wimp and the recoil nucleus versus the recoil energy .",
    "for the 10 gev / c@xmath6 wimp mass case , the most probable track length and recoil energy are : 15 mm , 13 kev and 0.8 mm , 5.8 kev for respectively fluorine in cf@xmath8 and sulfurine in cs@xmath5 .",
    "as expected in the case of nid , the sulfurine recoil in cs@xmath5 have fairly short track at the optimum pressure .",
    "the cutoff at 0.7 mm in the track length distribution for cs@xmath5 corresponds to the gem holes spacing requirement .",
    "finally , figure 4 shows the resulting figure of merit for fluorine recoils in cf@xmath8 and sulfurine recoils in cs@xmath5 .",
    "the optimum pressures to detect a 10 gev / c@xmath6 wimp mass are 1 torr and 3 torr , respectively for cf@xmath8 and cs@xmath5 .",
    "it appears that only cs@xmath5 among all the gases tested is competitive and can run at such low pressure .",
    "for example , magboltz [ @xcite ] indicates that at 1 torr cf@xmath8 , one will be in a multiplication regime for an electric field of few 10 s v / cm , above 100 s v / cm at 1 torr one is far away the thermal limit .",
    "the gases with light nuclei can also run for the low pressure given by the fom but are not competitive . for a 100 gev / c@xmath6 wimp mass only cf@xmath8 and cs@xmath5 are competitive .    for cs@xmath5-nid , a very low transverse diffusion of 50 @xmath22 at 80 torr and an electric field of 1 kv / cm",
    "have been reported in [ @xcite ] and is expected to run also at very low pressure with an electric field of few 10 s v / cm according to [ @xcite ] . while for comparison cf@xmath8 has a transverse diffusion of 150 @xmath22 at 80 torr and an electric field of 2 kv / cm .",

    "the detector is divided into nine sub - detectors with a maximum drift length of 33.33 cm .",
    "the wimp velocity distribution used is maxwellian , the dark matter density is 0.3 gev / c@xmath6/cm@xmath0 , and the escape velocity is 530 km / s .    the sensitivity to low mass wimps is increased for low pressure as illustrated by the cs@xmath5 results which can be seen in figure 5 ( left ) . if the pressure is increased at the cost of directionality , the sensitivity is drastically improved as expected ( see d@xmath0-ed , p = 40 torr no directionality curve in figure 5 - left ) so that after only a month of exposure the reach will be already below he region suggested by dama / libra [ @xcite ] and cogent [ @xcite ] . in principle",
