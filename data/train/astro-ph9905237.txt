    "the properties , frequency , and origin of dwarf galaxies have important implications for galaxy formation and cosmology . with an eye toward these implications , gallagher & wyse ( 1994 ) , grebel ( 1997 ) , da costa ( 1998 ) , and mateo ( 1998 )",
    "recently have reviewed the dwarf galaxies of the local group .",
    "as an example of a property of this class of galaxy where our knowledge is far from complete , consider the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function .",
    "figure [ gal_lum_fun ] shows a luminosity function , based on table 4 of mateo ( 1998 ) , for all dwarf galaxies in the local group , with those dwarfs associated with the milky way , m31 , and the general local group indicated .",
    "note that the faintest dwarf galaxies appear to be more common around the milky way than in other parts of the local group .",
    "is this a real effect or , instead , due to increasing incompleteness for low - luminosity dwarf galaxies as one looks beyond the outer halo of the galaxy ?",
    "the only way to resolve this and related questions is through more sensitive searches for low - luminosity galaxies in the local group .    we have undertaken a survey for low surface brightness dwarf galaxies around m31 .",
    "our methodology is the application of digital filtering techniques to the second palomar sky survey ( poss - ii ; reid et al .",
    "1991 , reid & djorgovski 1993 ) .",
    "our survey seeks to cover a larger area around m31 and to reach a deeper limiting central surface brightness than the pioneering survey of van den bergh ( 1972 , 1974 ) , which revealed three m31 dwarf companions ( and i , ii & iii ) . in the first paper of this series ( armandroff , davies , & jacoby 1998b ; hereafter referred to as paper i ) , we described our methodology , discussed its application to 1550 deg@xmath5 of the sky survey , and announced the first discovery of this survey : the new dwarf galaxy and v. we also presented a color  magnitude diagram for and v which yields a distance to this galaxy that is equivalent , within the uncertainties , to that of m31 .",
    "the line - of - sight distance to and v and its projected distance from m31 suggest association with m31 .",
    "the color  magnitude diagram also implies a mean metal abundance for and v of [ fe / h ] @xmath11 1.5 and lacks bright blue stars .",
    "this absence of a young population in the color  magnitude diagram , the lack of h@xmath3 emission in the differencing of our deep h@xmath3 and @xmath12 images , and the non - detection of far - infrared emission all imply that and v is a dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxy , and not a dwarf irregular galaxy . and v thus joined m31 s three other dwarf spheroidal companions ( and i , ii & iii ) and three more luminous dwarf elliptical companions ( ngc 147 , 185 and 205 ) . ic 10 , a dwarf irregular , lgs 3 , a transition object between dwarf irregular and dwarf spheroidal , and m32 , a low - luminosity elliptical , complete the inventory of dwarf galaxies commonly accepted as associated with m31 .    in this paper , we discuss the next product of our survey : and vi .",
    "the newly discovered galaxy and vi is found to be another dwarf spheroidal companion to m31 ( see also karachentsev & karachentseva 1999 ; grebel & guhathakurta 1999 ; hopp et al .",
    "using the methodology of paper i , we found an excellent low surface brightness dwarf candidate at the following celestial coordinates : @xmath3 = 23@xmath1351@xmath1446.3@xmath15 , @xmath16 = + 24@xmath1734@xmath1857@xmath19 ( j2000.0 ) .",
    "these correspond to galactic coordinates of : @xmath20 = 106.0@xmath17 , @xmath21 = 36.3@xmath17 . anticipating the evidence presented below and following van den bergh ( 1972 ) , we will call this new galaxy andromeda vi .",
    "figure [ survey_map ] shows and vi s location on the sky relative to m31 , m31 s known companions , and our search area .",
    "figure [ and6dss ] displays and vi on the digitized poss - ii , raw and after our enhancement procedure .",
    "one sees a strong resemblance between and vi and the known m31 dwarf spheroidals and ii & iii on the raw and processed poss - ii images ( compare figure [ and6dss ] with figure 1 of armandroff et al .",
    "1998b ) . and vi is visible on the poss - ii @xmath0 and @xmath12 transparencies .",
    "and i , ii & iii are also visible on the poss - ii transparencies .",
    "there are three possible reasons why and vi was not recognized until recently .",
    "first , it is just outside the van den bergh ( 1972 , 1974 ) search area .",
    "second , and vi is located right next to a bright star , so it might have been thought to be a ghost reflection caused by that star .",
    "finally , examination of the poss - ii transparencies reveals diffuse galactic emission to be common in this region , so and vi could have been interpreted as part of this extended emission .",
    "as a first step toward clarifying its nature , and vi was imaged at the kitt peak national observatory 4-m telescope prime focus with the t2 kb ccd on 1998 january 23 ( u.t . )",
    ". only one @xmath1 exposure of 300 sec was obtained due to and vi s limited visibility in january .",
    "and vi resolved nicely into stars in this short @xmath1 image , suggesting that it is indeed a nearby dwarf galaxy .",
    "and vi was imaged more deeply using the wiyn 3.5-m telescope , the s2 kb ccd ( a 2048 @xmath22 2048 stis device ) mounted at the nasmyth focus , and the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 filters on several occasions during 1998 september and october .",
    "the scale was 0.197 arcsec / pixel , and each image covered 6.7@xmath226.7 arcmin .",
    "the exposure times , dates of observation , and the resulting image quality are listed in table [ obs_table ] .",
    "the deep images were taken during three nights when the seeing conditions were excellent ( 0.6  0.8 arcsec fwhm ) .",
    "these deep exposures were calibrated via images taken on a photometric night during which 13 landolt ( 1992 ) standards were observed .",
    "all images were overscan corrected , bias subtracted , and flat fielded in the standard manner .",
    "the @xmath2 images were defringed using the scaled combination of several dark - sky fringe frames .",
    "figure [ and6_ccd_image ] displays a color image of and vi made from the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 ccd images from wiyn .",
    "and vi resolves nicely into stars on the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 images .",
    "the and vi images exhibit a smooth stellar distribution and a resemblance with the other m31 dwarf spheroidals ( compare figure [ and6_ccd_image ] with figure 1 of armandroff et al .",
    "1993 and/or figure 4 of paper i ) . and",
    "vi does not look lumpy or show obvious regions of star formation that would suggest a dwarf irregular , as opposed to dwarf spheroidal , classification .",
    "no obvious globular clusters are seen in and vi , though none are expected for a low - luminosity dwarf spheroidal ( e.g. , sec .",
    "4.3 of da costa & armandroff 1995 ) .    in order to look for possible ionized gas , and vi was observed with the kpno 4-m telescope in h@xmath3 narrowband and @xmath12 on 1998 july 15 ( u.t . ) with the ccd mosaic imager ( armandroff et al .",
    "the h@xmath3 filter used has a central wavelength of 6569   and a width of 80   fwhm in the f/3.2 beam of the telescope .",
    "three narrowband exposures of 700 sec each and three @xmath12 exposures of 300 sec each were obtained .",
    "the average seeing was 1.2 arcsec fwhm , sampled at 0.26 arcsec / pixel .",
    "we computed scaling ratios between the combined h@xmath3 and @xmath12 images and performed the subtraction .",
    "figure [ and6halpha ] shows both the h@xmath3 image and the continuum - subtracted h@xmath3 image .",
    "no diffuse h@xmath3 emission or h ii regions are detected in the and vi continuum - subtracted image .",
    "the only features seen in this image are in the vicinity of the brighter stars , where residuals are caused by the slightly different behavior of the point spread function ( psf ) between @xmath12 and h@xmath3 . no diffuse h@xmath3 emission or h",
    "ii regions were found in and v either ( paper i ) .",
    "the lack of h@xmath3 emission in and vi rules out current high - mass star formation .",
    "almost all local group dwarf irregular galaxies are strongly detected in h@xmath3 ( e.g. , kennicutt 1994 ) .",
    "and vi s lack of h@xmath3 emission , coupled with its smooth , regular appearance on broadband images , suggests that it is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( rather than a dwarf irregular ) .",
    "we also examined the iras 12- , 25- , 60- , and 100-micron maps of the and vi region , using the fresco data product from ipac . and vi is not detected in any of the iras far - infrared bands .",
    "and i , ii , iii & v are not detected by iras either ( see paper i ) .",
    "far - infrared emission , as seen by iras , is the signature of warm dust .",
    "as discussed in paper i , some local group dwarf irregular galaxies are detected by iras",
    ". and vi s non - detection in the far infrared is consistent with and vi being a dsph galaxy . however , the non - detection by iras does not eliminate the possibility that and vi is a low - luminosity relatively quiescent dwarf irregular galaxy .",
    "the h@xmath3 data and the color  magnitude diagram provide stronger evidence on and vi s classification .",
    "the next step in our study of and vi is the construction of a color  magnitude diagram for its resolved stars in order to derive its distance and explore its stellar populations characteristics .",
    "instrumental magnitudes were measured on the deep and vi wiyn images using the iraf implementation of the daophot crowded - field photometry program ( stetson 1987 , stetson et al .",
    "the standard daophot procedure was used , culminating in multiple iterations of allstar .",
    "stars with anomalously large values of the daophot quality - of - fit indicator chi were deleted from the photometry lists .",
    "large - aperture photometry was performed for the 13 well - exposed landolt ( 1992 ) photometric standard stars . adopting mean",
    "atmospheric extinction coefficients for kitt peak , photometric transformation equations were derived .",
    "only a zeropoint and a linear color term of small size were needed to represent the transformation for each filter . for each of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , several stars that are well exposed on both the deep and vi images and the and vi images from the photometric calibration night",
    "were used to derive the magnitude offsets between the deep images and the standard system .",
    "the ( @xmath2,@xmath1@xmath2 ) color  magnitude diagram of and vi is shown in figure [ cmd_fiducial ] .",
    "we used the spatial distribution of the stars in the red - giant region of the color  magnitude diagram to determine a reasonably precise center for and vi .",
    "only stars within 370 pixels ( 73 arcsec ) of this center are plotted in figure [ cmd_fiducial ] .",
    "this radius was chosen in order to provide a reasonably large sample of and vi members while minimizing contamination by field stars and is similar to the core radius of 76 arcsec ( caldwell 1999 ) .",
    "our and vi color  magnitude diagram clearly shows a red giant branch .",
    "the contamination of the color  magnitude diagram by foreground stars appears rather minor ( see also below ) .    in order to interpret the color  magnitude diagram ,",
    "an estimate of the foreground reddening is necessary .",
    "note that different authors have adopted slightly different reddenings to the m31 companions .",
    "we adopt e(@xmath0@xmath1 ) = 0.06 @xmath6 0.01 for and vi based on the iras / dirbe results of schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) .",
    "this value is 0.02 mag larger than that adopted by grebel & guhathakurta ( 1999 ) because they applied a correction for the mean difference between the schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) e(@xmath0@xmath1 ) values and those of burstein & heiles ( 1982 ) .",
    "assuming @xmath23 = 3.2@xmath22e(@xmath0@xmath1 ) and the e(@xmath0@xmath1 ) to e(@xmath1@xmath2 ) conversion of dean , warren , & cousins ( 1978 ) , e(@xmath1@xmath2 ) = 0.08 @xmath6 0.01 and @xmath24 = 0.11 @xmath6 0.02 .    a distance can be derived for and vi using the @xmath2 magnitude of the tip of the red giant branch ( da costa & armandroff 1990 ; lee et al .",
    "1993a ) . figure [ and6_lf ] shows a cumulative luminosity function in @xmath2 for and vi ( again , for stars within 370 pixels [ 73 arcsec ] of the and vi center ) .",
    "color limits of 0.9 @xmath25 @xmath1@xmath2 @xmath25 2.2 have been used in constructing the luminosity function in order to maximize its sensitivity to and vi red giants and to minimize its dependence on foreground contamination .",
    "no correction for foreground contamination has been applied to the luminosity function for the following reasons . even in the corners of our and vi images ,",
    "the and vi giant branch is seen .",
    "thus we have no true foreground / background measurement .",
    "however , a color  magnitude diagram for the corners of our images ( distance from and vi s center @xmath26 191 arcsec ) that covers 2.8 times more area than represented in figures [ cmd_fiducial ] and [ and6_lf ] shows no stars with @xmath27 within the color limits used to calculate the luminosity function .",
    "therefore , over the magnitude and color intervals that we are identifying the red giant branch tip , figures [ cmd_fiducial ] and [ and6_lf ] are quite free of field contamination . based on the magnitude at which the luminosity function begins to rise strongly ( see figure [ and6_lf ] , especially the inset which shows the derivative of the cumulative luminosity function ) , the @xmath2 magnitude of the red giant branch tip in and vi is 20.56 @xmath6 0.10 .",
    "this value is supported by the apparent location of the red giant branch tip in the color  magnitude diagram ( see figure [ cmd_fiducial ] ) . for metal - poor systems such as and vi ( as demonstrated below ) , the red giant branch tip occurs at @xmath28 = 4.0 ( da costa & armandroff 1990 ; lee et al .",
    "this results in distance moduli of ( @xmath29@xmath30)@xmath31 = 24.56 and ( @xmath29@xmath30)@xmath32 = 24.45 @xmath6 0.10 , corresponding to a distance of 775 @xmath6 35 kpc .    as discussed in da costa",
    "( 1996 ) and paper i , the best available population ii distances for m31 ( on the same distance scale as the red giant branch tip calibration used above ) are : 760 @xmath6 45 kpc based on the red giant branch tip ( mould & kristian 1986 ) or rr lyrae stars ( pritchet & van den bergh 1988 ) in the m31 halo ; or 850 @xmath6 20 kpc from the horizontal branch magnitudes of eight m31 globular clusters ( fusi pecci et al .",
    "our distance for and vi is consistent , within the combined uncertainties , with both of these m31 distances .",
    "thus and vi is at approximately the same distance along the line of sight as m31 , suggesting an association between and vi and m31 .",
    "note also that our line - of - sight distance of 775 @xmath6 35 kpc for and vi is very similar to those of and i ( 810 @xmath6 30 kpc ; da costa et al .",

    "the galactic dwarf spheroidal leo i has a galactocentric distance of @xmath4250 kpc , comparable to and vi s projected distance from m31 .",
    "the above line - of - sight and projected distances strongly suggest that and vi is a member of m31 s satellite system .",
    "two other groups have recently published color ",

    "their distances for and vi based on the tip of the red giant branch , 830 @xmath6 80 kpc ( grebel & guhathakurta 1999 ) and 795 @xmath6 75 kpc ( hopp et al .",
    "1999 ) , are consistent with our value of 775 @xmath6 35 kpc .",
    "all three determinations adopt the same zeropoint for the tip of the red giant branch method and thus are on the same distance scale .    based on the ( @xmath1,@xmath0@xmath1 ) and ( @xmath2,@xmath1@xmath2 ) color  magnitude diagrams",

    "as discussed in paper i , the location of and v north of m31 lessens both of these asymmetries , and cas s location north of m31 reduces the asymmetries further ( see figure 2 ) . because and vi is south of m31 , it diminishes the asymmetry reduction provided by the cas dwarf .",
    "karachentsev ( 1996 ) called attention to the elongated shape of the distribution of m31 companions , with axis ratio 5:2:1 ( based on the galaxies labelled in figure [ survey_map ] that were known in 1996 plus the more distant galaxy ic 1613 , all of which he argues are associated with m31 ) . on the sky , this elongation occurs primarily along the north  south axis . as discussed in paper",
    "i , and v is located within this flattened spatial distribution .",
    "of all the m31 companions , and vi s location to the southeast of m31 places it the furthest from this elongated distribution , and nearly on the distribution s minor axis .",
    "the cas dwarf is the next most deviant companion from the elongated pattern .    with projected radii from the center of m31 of 112 , 271 and 224 kpc , respectively , and v , and vi and cas increase the mean projected radius of the m31 dwarf spheroidals from 86 kpc to 144 kpc .",
    "karachentsev ( 1996 ) also called attention to morphological segregation among the m31 companions , with the dwarf ellipticals and dwarf spheroidals located closer to m31 , and the spirals and irregulars on the periphery ( see also van den bergh 1994 regarding segregation among the galactic companions ) .",
    "the identification of and vi and cas extends the presence of dwarf spheroidals to galactocentric distances comparable to those of lgs 3 ( a transition object between dwarf irregular and dwarf spheroidal ) and ic 10 ( a dwarf irregular ) .",
    "thus , and vi and cas weaken the case for morphological segregation in the m31 satellite system .",
    "the discovery of dwarf galaxies like and vi , and v and cas augments the faint end of the luminosity function of the local group . because of the special way that nearby dwarf galaxies are selected , the local group is uniquely suited to the study of the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function ( e.g. , pritchet & van den bergh 1999 ) .",
    "accurate integrated @xmath1 magnitudes are now available for and vi , and v and cas from wide - field ccd imaging ( caldwell 1999 ) . when combined with the distance moduli ( this paper ; paper i ; grebel & guhathakurta 1999 ) , these yield @xmath33 values of -11.3 , -9.1 , and -12.0 for and vi , and v , and cas , respectively .",
    "luminosity functions for m31 s dwarf companions and for the entire local group that include and highlight these three new dwarf spheroidals are shown in figure [ new_gal_lum_fun ] . the local group and subgroup memberships and @xmath33 values for the galaxies besides and vi , and v , and cas are from mateo ( 1998 ) , except for the lmc and smc which are from westerlund ( 1997 ) . and",
    "vi , and v and cas increase the number of galaxies with -9.0 @xmath26 @xmath33 @xmath42 -12.0 that are m31 companions by 75% and in the entire local group by 19% .    from a survey of nine clusters of galaxies , trentham ( 1998 )",
    "derived a composite luminosity function that is steeper at the faint end than that of the local group ( see his figure 2 ) .",
    "he attributed the seeming shortfall at faint @xmath33 in the local group to poor counting statistics and/or incompleteness .",
    "the discovery of and vi , and v and cas reduces somewhat the difference between the local group luminosity function and trentham s ( 1998 ) function . to illustrate the difference ,",
    "we have plotted a version of the trentham luminosity function , transformed from @xmath0 to @xmath1 assuming ( @xmath0@xmath1)@xmath32 = 0.70 , in figure [ new_gal_lum_fun ] .",
    "the trentham function has been normalized to match the m31 and local group functions in the interval -16 @xmath26",
    "@xmath33 @xmath42 -18 .",
    "one sees that the luminosity function for clusters of galaxies contains many more galaxies for @xmath33 @xmath43 -13 than are known in the local group . despite the inclusion of the three newly discovered local group dwarf spheroidals , the difference between the trentham ( 1998 ) luminosity function and that of the local group remains significant at faint @xmath33 ( @xmath26 95% confidence level ) .",
    "pritchet & van den bergh ( 1999 ) reached the same conclusion using a somewhat different assemblage of local group data .",
    "provided that the trentham function is representative , we conclude that either faint dwarf galaxies are much less common in the local group than in richer clusters or that the local group sample is incomplete by @xmath410 to @xmath425 galaxies in the @xmath33 range 12 to 14 .",
    "one important issue remains regarding figure [ new_gal_lum_fun ] .",
    "is the peak of the histogram in the region -11 @xmath43 @xmath33 @xmath43 -12 , followed by a decline at fainter magnitudes , real or is it caused by incompleteness and small number statistics ?",
    "the luminosity function is expected to decline fainter than some @xmath33 because of the inability of sufficiently small proto - galactic gas clouds to collapse and form stars due to photoionization by ultraviolet background radiation ( e.g. , thoul & weinberg 1996 ) . our continuing search for faint dwarf galaxies in the vicinity of m31 and other local group searches should help resolve the issue of where this turnover occurs .    beyond the observational evidence for a deficit of dwarfs in the local group based on trentham s ( 1998 ) luminosity function ,",
    "similarly dramatic discrepancies ( factors of 15 or more ) are suggested by recent theoretical developments .",
    "klypin et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , for example , present simulations of the hierarchical formation of small groups like our local group in the currently favored @xmath44cdm universe .",
    "while @xmath440 local group galaxies are known , those authors predict that @xmath4500 galaxies should exist for which the vast majority are low luminosity dwarfs .",
    "that number doubles when the search radius extends from @xmath4300 to @xmath4600 kpc from the host galaxy .",
    "our continuing survey around m31 , especially when we extend it to larger radii , will provide a tight constraint on the true number of faint dwarf galaxies in the local group .",
    "the digitized sky surveys were produced at the space telescope science institute under u.s .",
    "government grant nag w-2166 .",
    "the survey images used here are based on photographic data obtained using the oschin schmidt telescope on palomar mountain .",
    "the second palomar observatory sky survey was made by the california institute of technology with funds from the national science foundation , the national geographic society , the sloan foundation , the samuel oschin foundation , and the eastman kodak corporation .",
