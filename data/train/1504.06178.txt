    "right after the process @xmath2 , the second most important decay channel of a neutral pion is the dalitz decay @xmath0 with a branching ratio @xmath3  @xcite .",

    "as one of the main results of their work the table of radiative corrections @xmath6 to the leading - order ( lo ) differential decay rate was presented .",
    "it turned out that such a table would be very useful for the monte carlo simulations in experiments covering @xmath7 decays , e.g.  the na48 experiment at cern  @xcite . in practice , for the table of values @xmath6 , which was published in ref .",
    "@xcite , an interpolation or extrapolation procedure needs to be used in order to get the radiative correction at any desired point of the dalitz plot .",

    "included also the muon loop contribution to the vacuum polarization insertion correction , our result can be in principle also applied to the other related processes .",

    "when an eta meson and its decays come into play , some peculiarities inevitably appear .",
    "we comment on this a little in the present work but postpone the details and the results of the radiative corrections for this case to the paper in preparation .",
    "nevertheless , we try to be as general as possible considering the presented results so one can utilize the formulas without modifications later on .    to proceed even further we have also included the one - loop one - photon - irreducible contribution , which was considered to be negligible in the original paper  @xcite due to its proportionality to the lepton mass .",
