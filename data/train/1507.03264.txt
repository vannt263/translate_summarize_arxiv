    "the discovery of the higgs boson at the large hadron collider(lhc)@xcite@xcite is a major step towards understanding the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) mechanism and marks a new era in particle physics . in order to ultimately establish the nature of the higgs , a precise measurement of the higgs couplings to fermions and gauge bosons as well as",
    "the higgs self - coupling is needed .",
    "these precision measurements will be some of the most important tasks for experiments at the lhc and the future colliders . according to the analyses of the atlas and cms collaborations ,",
    "the couplings of the higgs boson have been measured with an overall precision of about @xmath11 , which means that there still remains some room for the existence new physics . besides the higgs boson",
    ", the measurement of the top quark properties is also important .",
    "it is the heaviest known elementary particle which makes it an excellent candidate for new physics searches . to probe new physics through the higgs boson and top quark , the top - higgs yukawa couplings are of special interest since they are sensitive to new flavor dynamics beyond the standard model(sm )",
    "not too far above the electroweak scale .",
    "furthermore , top quark , as the heaviest sm fermion , it owns the strongest yukawa coupling . among the higgs couplings to quarks , the most promising place to reveal new physics at high energy colliders",
    "are processes involving top quarks .",
    "the mass of the top quark is heavier than that of the observed higgs boson , which makes the top quark flavor changing neutral current(fcnc ) processes @xmath12 kinematically accessible . in the sm ,",
    "processes that are induced by fcnc in top quark production or decay are extremely suppressed by the glashow - iliopoulos - maiani(g.i.m . )",
    "mechanism@xcite according to sm computation , with decay rates of the order of @xmath13 or below .",
    "however , new physics scenarios , such as the minimal supersymmetric model ( mssm ) with / without r - parity violating@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm ) @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , warped extra dimensions@xcite@xcite , alternative left - right symmetric models ( alrm)@xcite , little higgs with t parity ( lht)@xcite , etc , could enhance the fcnc rates by several orders of magnitude , thus making them detectable using current experimental data . therefore , studying the top - higgs fcnc interactions is important both from a theoretical as well as an experimental perspective .    up to now , the searches for @xmath14 have been investigated experimentally at the lhc which gives the strong limits on the top - higgs fcnc couplings . among them ,",
    "the most stringent constraint of @xmath15 , @xmath16 at @xmath17 confidence level ( c.l . ) was reported by the cms collaboration from a combination of the multilepton channel and the diphoton plus lepton channel@xcite . while an upper limit is set on the @xmath18 branching ratio of @xmath19 at the @xmath17 confidence level by the atlas collaboration@xcite@xcite . except for",
    "the widely studied @xmath14 decays , the importance of the single top higgs associated production has been also emphasized in the recent theoretical studies especially at the lhc @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . in our present paper ,",
    "we study the anomalous fcnc yukawa interactions between the top quark , the higgs boson , and either an up or charm quark ( @xmath20 ) at the large hadron electron collider(lhec ) .",
    "the lhec kinematic range exceeds hera s by a factor of about 20 , due to the combination of a 7 tev or higher proton beam from the lhc and a new 60 gev to 150 gev electron beam .",
    "its luminosity is projected to be as high as possibly @xmath21 , with a default design value of @xmath22 .",
    "this is almost a thousand times higher than hera s luminosity , which gives the lhec the potential of a precision measurement higgs production facility and enables a very large variety of new measurements and searches to be conducted .",
    "typically we choose two channels to study the anomalous fcnc yukawa interactions at the lhec .",
    "one is the channel @xmath1 with @xmath23 and the other is the channel @xmath2 .",
    "both channels are charged current ( cc ) interaction processes induced through @xmath3 collision at the lhec .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : we build the calculation framework in section 2 including a brief introduction to the anomalous flavor changing @xmath24 couplings and our selected production channels .",
    "section 3 is arranged to present the numerical results as well as the signal and background analysis .",
    "typically , the @xmath25 decay modes are taken into account . in section 4",
    "we present bounds on anomalous @xmath24 couplings at the future lhec .",
    "finally we summarize our conclusions in the last section .",
    "considering the fcnc yukawa interactions , the sm lagrangian can be extended simply by allowing the following terms , @xmath26 where the real parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote the flavor changing couplings of higgs to up - type quarks .",
    "now we have @xmath29 larger than @xmath30 .",
    "in addition to the usual top decay mode @xmath31 , the top quark can also decay into a charm or up quark associated with a higgs boson .",
    "therefore , the total decay width of the top - quark @xmath32 is @xmath33 the decay width of the dominant top quark decay mode @xmath34 at the lo and the nlo could be found in ref@xcite .",
    "it is given below @xmath35 \\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the lo decay width and @xmath37 is the velocity of the w boson in the top quark rest frame .",
    "@xmath38 is the fermi constant .",
    "the @xmath39 partial decay width is given as@xcite @xmath40 \\sqrt{1-(\\tau_{h}-\\tau_{u(c)})^2}\\sqrt{1-(\\tau_{h}+\\tau_{u(c)})^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "the leading order branching ration for @xmath43 is then given by @xmath44 here the higgs boson and the top quark masses are chosen to be @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively .",
    "similar to the top quark decay , the new interactions affect also the width of the higgs though the additional decay into an off - shell top that subsequently leads to a single @xmath47 decay of the higgs , namely @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes off - shell top quark .",
    "therefore we get @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the normal higgs decay width in sm . while other terms related to the higgs boson three - body decays are numerically estimated following ref@xcite .",
    "the stringent constraints on the anomalous fcnc couplings are set exploiting the experimental data of the cms and atlas collaborations@xcite@xcite@xcite . theoretically , many other phenomenological studies are performed based on these experimental data .",
    "the analysis of ref@xcite emphasizes the importance of anomalous single top plus higgs production at the lhc deriving the @xmath17 c.l .",
    "upper limits @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "ref@xcite studies the single top and higgs associated production @xmath54 in the presence of top - higgs fcnc couplings at the lhc , giving the upper limits as @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 with an integrated luminosity of 3000 @xmath9 at @xmath58 .",
    "ref@xcite quotes a @xmath17 c.l .",
    "limit sensitivity in the @xmath59 final state of @xmath60 with an integrated luminosity of 300(3000 ) @xmath9 at @xmath61 . as can be seen the upper limits on the flavour changing top quark decays can be significantly improved as expected at a high lumi(hl)-lhc .",
    "ref@xcite derives model - independent constraints on the tch and tuh couplings that arise from the bounds on hadronic electric dipole moments .",
    "refs@xcite and @xcite study the top quark decay into higgs boson , a light quark and top higgs associated production including the next - to - leading order qcd effects .",
    "other related publications can be found , for example , in refs@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , etc .",
    "now we turn to study the selected production processes where the effect of the flavor changing couplings could be significant .",
    "partonic feynman diagrams for @xmath62 with q = u , c. black blobs represent the anomalous @xmath24 couplings parameterized by eq.([lagrangian ] ) . ]    the first channel we will consider is @xmath62 production . the parton level signal process at the lhec can be expressed as @xmath63 with @xmath23 and @xmath64 are the four - momentum of initial and final particles , respectively .",
    "the feynman diagram for the partonic process is depicted in fig.[feynman1 ] .",
    "the flavor changing vertex proportional to the flavor changing coupling @xmath6 occurs via the single top production with its following decay to higgs plus u or c quark , where this single top quark is induced by the collision of b quark from the proton with the @xmath65 boson emission from the electron beam .",
    "we thus expect the cross sections for these processes to be proportional to @xmath66 where c is some related constants . the parent level signal process @xmath67 , the kinematic distributions and integrated cross sections",
    "can then be obtained by convoluting the parton level process with the parton distribution function ( pdf)@xcite of quark in the proton , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the center - of - mass(c.m . ) colliding energy and x is the momentum fraction of anti - b quark from proton .",
    "partonic feynman diagrams for @xmath2 .",
    "black blobs represent the anomalous @xmath24 couplings parameterized by eq.([lagrangian ] ) . ]",
    "the second channel we considered is @xmath70 production .",
    "the parton level signal process at the lhec can be expressed as @xmath71 the feynman diagram for the partonic process is depicted in fig.[feynman2 ] .",
    "the fcnc top - higgs yukawa couplings are deduced from the initial state u(c)-quarks from the proton collision with the anti - top quark from the @xmath72 coupling .",
    "similarly , the parent level signal process @xmath73 is present as @xmath74 where @xmath23 and @xmath75 is again the c.m . colliding energy at the lhec .      the two channels @xmath62 and",
    "@xmath70 that we have presented are charged current ( cc ) processes where the cc production leads to a top - beauty associated production through @xmath65 boson emission from the initial electron .",
    "in addition to cc production , the flavor changing yukawa couplings can also be produced through neutral current ( nc ) productions . in",
    "nc it gives rise to pair production of top - antitop quarks from a neutral photon / z boson emission from the initial electron .",
    "a comparison of the cross sections of these cc and nc production channels including the anomalous fcnc top - higgs yukawa couplings is presented in tab.[ccnc ] . here",
    "the input parameters and the very basic kinematical cuts will be presented in our following discussion .",
    "c c   + channels & @xmath76[fb ] + @xmath1 & 41.64 + @xmath77 & 1.987 + @xmath78 & 0.616 + @xmath79 & 0.901 +    from tab.[ccnc ] , we see that the largest production is cc @xmath1 production .",
    "for @xmath80 it is more than 10 times larger than the sum of the other channels .",
    "different from the cc production which leads to a top - beauty final state , the nc production gives rise to pair produced top - antitop quarks .",
    "the nc productions are small , but still sizeable at the lhec especially when the polarized electron beam is considered .",
    "furthermore , in sharp contrast to the lhc , the absence of pile - up and underlying event effects at the lhec , high rates of single anti - top production is expected to providing a better insight through these production channels .",
    "the rapidity distributions of the higgs boson through different channels are given in fig.[yh ] . in our paper",
    ", we only consider the cc interactions which dominate over all the other production mechanisms .",
    "this includes @xmath1 and @xmath81 channels .",
    "looking at tab.[ccnc ] , we also find that the cross section of the former channel is larger than that of the latter one by roughly a factor of 20 . at first sight",
    "this seems odd , because the transition @xmath82 involves an ( anti)bottom - quark pdf , while the transition of @xmath83 does not .",
    "one is therefore tempted to think that the cross section of @xmath84 is smaller than that of @xmath85 .",
    "however , this naive assertion is incorrect , because for @xmath1 the internal ( anti)top is exchanged in the s - channel , while in the case @xmath81 the top appears in a t - channel exchange .",
    "the pdf suppression is thus over compensated by an on - shell enhancement .",
    "we take the input parameters as @xcite @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , so we have @xmath89 and @xmath90 . for the strong coupling",
    "constant we take @xmath91 . throughout this paper",
    ", we set the quark masses as @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the top quark mass is set to @xmath46 with its width @xmath94 when @xmath80 .",
    "for the leptons , we keep @xmath95 , and @xmath96",
    ". we do not consider the contribution from small ckm matrix @xmath97 where q and @xmath98 are not the same generation .",
    "for the mass of the higgs boson , we take @xmath45 with the sm width to be @xmath99 .",
    "the partonic cross sections are convoluted with cteq6l1@xcite parton distribution functions ( pdf ) keeping factorization and renormalization scale @xmath100 . for the lhec colliding energy",
    ", we consider the future 14 tev proton at future lhc and an energetic new electron beam with the energies of 150 gev@xcite@xcite .",
    "the luminosity is taken to be a running parameter .",
    "the fcnc couplings are chosen to be @xmath80 and @xmath101 for simplicity .",
    "this set of parameters will be used as default unless being stated otherwise .",
    "the event reconstruction is still based on a parameterised , generic lhc - style detector .",
    "the general acceptance cuts in the lab frame for the events are : @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the separation in the rapidity - azimuth plane , @xmath104 are the transverse momentum of jets ( refer as j ) , leptons and photons while @xmath105 is the missing transverse momentum .",
    "we stress here that cuts in eq.([basiccuts ] ) are the very basic ones and might be changed later in our following discussion .",
    "lets first consider the @xmath7 channel with @xmath107 decay mode .",
    "the considered signal production can be written as @xmath108 with @xmath23 . since in our calculation",
    "we take the anomalous fcnc couplings to be @xmath80 and @xmath101 for simplicity , only @xmath109 contributes .",
    "higgs decays to pairs of photons are simulated using madgraph@xcite where the implementation of the effective @xmath110 interaction is adopted @xcite . for simplicity one can also multiply the production cross sections with the higgs branching ratio corresponding to the final state .",
    "as can be seen , in this case , the studied topology of our signal gives rise to the @xmath111 signature characterized by one jet , a missing transverse momentum ( @xmath112 ) from the undetected neutrino and a diphoton signal appearing as a narrow resonance centered around the higgs boson mass .",
    "the irreducible background comes from the sm process @xmath113 which yields the identical final states with the signal .",
    "these backgrounds mainly come from the production of w boson with double photon production through @xmath114 , @xmath115 couplings or through @xmath116 decay associated with jet emission .",
    "the others come from jet production associated with emission of photons . in order to obtain the anomalous fcnc tqh coupling effects",
    ", we need to simulate all the signal contributions precisely together with these irreducible backgrounds as well as their interference .",
    "the total cross section for these reactions thus can be split into three contributions @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the sm prediction , the term @xmath119 linear in @xmath27 arises from the interference between sm and the anomalous amplitudes , whereas the quadratic term @xmath120 is the self - interference of the anomalous amplitudes .",
    "potentially reducible backgrounds come from various other sm processes that yield different final states which are attributed to the @xmath111 signature due to a misidentification of one or more of the final state objects .",
    "for example , two light jets production with both jets faking a diphoton pair , one jet one photon associated production with one jet faking a photon or leptons faking photons , etc .",
    "the background arising from @xmath121 is smaller than 1 percent of signal after applying all cuts and taking rejection factors into account .",
    "we consider all these contributions and take the jet faking a photon rate to be 0.001 , the electron faking photon rate to be 0.062@xcite during data analysis .",
    "although the @xmath122 decay channel has a small branching ratio , it has the advantage of good resolution on the @xmath122 resonance and is also free from the large qcd backgrounds .",
    "typically , we use a narrow invariant mass window @xmath123 gev to further reduce the non - resonant backgrounds as well as the jet such that the invariant mass of @xmath124 system to be near mass of the top quark , say , @xmath125 belongs to the range @xmath126 $ ] gev .",
