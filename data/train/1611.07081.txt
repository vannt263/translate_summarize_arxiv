    "subdiffusion can occur in media , as gels or porous media , in which random walk of particles is significantly hindered by a complex structure of a medium @xcite . in a three dimensional system subdiffusion is often characterized by the relation @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the mean square displacement of a particle , @xmath13 is a subdiffusion coefficient and @xmath14 is a subdiffusion parameter , @xmath15 denotes the gamma function , @xmath16 .",
    "the case @xmath17 corresponds to normal diffusion .",
    "we consider subdiffusion with reaction in a system which consists of two homogeneous media joined together .",
    "we assume that static particles @xmath18 are homogeneously distributed in a first medium whereas static particles @xmath19 are homogeneously distributed in a second medium .",
    "a mobile particle @xmath1 can react with particles @xmath18 and @xmath19 according to the formula @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "the reactions can be interpreted as absorption of particles @xmath1 by static ` absorbing centres ' @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we mention here that normal diffusion and anomalous diffusion with absorption have been studied in zeolites @xcite and in clay materials such as bentonite @xcite and halloysite @xcite .",
    "the absorbing centers may be located on the surfaces of tubules inside the medium in which the diffusion takes place .",
    "we add that , as it is discussed in @xcite , presence of absorbing centers on walls bounding the system can change a character of diffusion .",
    "subdiffusion with reactions ( absorption ) is usually described by equations with fractional time derivative @xcite .",
    "when a particle @xmath1 meets @xmath22 the reaction can occur with probability controlled by reaction rates : @xmath23 in the first medium and @xmath24 in the second one .",
    "the situation is complicated when subdiffusion is considered in a composite system which consists of different media joined together . to solve equations describing subdiffusion ",
    "reaction process in a composite medium one needs two boundary conditions at the border between media . however , there are many examples that the determination of the boundary conditions at the points of system s discontinuity is ambiguous @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider subdiffusion in a composite system consisting of two media which can have different subdiffusion parameters and reaction rates , see fig .",

    "it means that a particle which makes a jump from one medium to another through the boundary between the media will come to a new medium .",
    "there are no obstacles such as partially permeable barrier between the media .",
    "an ` anomalous behavior ' of the particle in the border region can be created only by the difference of subdiffusion and reaction parameters of the media .",
    "the main aim is to derive the green s functions for the system under study . from the obtained functions we derive boundary conditions at the border between media . in order to derive the green s functions we will use a simple model of a random walk with reactions in a system with discrete time and spatial variables .",
    "next , we move to a system with continuous variables by means of the rules presented in this paper .",
    "the choice of such methodology is due to the fact that difference equations describing random walk of particle in a composite system are solvable .",
    "the behavior of the particle at the boundary between media is involved in discrete model in a ` naturaly way ' .",
    "similar models were previously used to derive the green s functions for various kinds of subdiffusion in a system with a thin membrane @xcite and to derive parabolic or hiperbolic subdiffusion ",
    "reaction equations @xcite . however , the procedure used here is significantly changed compared to the procedures used in the above cited papers .",
    "the reason is that when considering a system consisting of two different media , additional rules which enable to correctly set the reaction and subdiffusion parameters of both media in the obtained functions should be found .",

    "however , the equations describing diffusion - reaction in discrete system and in continuous system have different interpretations .",
    "a model based on discrete equations describes a process in which each jump of particle has the same length , and the absorption can only take place , with some probability , just prior to the next jump .",
    "the diffusion  reaction equation can also be obtained from the continuous time random walk model within the mean  field approximation @xcite .",
    "the interpretations of both models are similar when we suppose that the position @xmath44 in the discrete system represents the interval @xmath164 in the system with continuous space variable and the process is considered over very long time @xcite .",
    "if @xmath65 is assumed to be not too small , then fluctuations of particles concentration can be neglected as in the case of the mean field approximation .",
    "however , regardless of the interpretation of both models , discrete model can be treated as a useful tool to determine the green s functions and the boundary conditions at the border between media .",
    "the reason of such statement is that the discrete model leads to green s functions that are solutions to the subdiffusion",
    " reaction equations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "in addition , the discrete model has a simple physical interpretation , which gives credence to the boundary conditions derived by means of this model .",

    "( [ eq4 ] ) only when the probability of meeting of particles @xmath1 and @xmath2 just after the jump made by the particle @xmath1 is less than 1 .",
    "when the probability of particles meeting is equal to 1 , the reaction @xmath0 causes the same effect as the reaction @xmath165 @xcite .",
    "then the subdiffusion  reaction process can not be described by eq .",
