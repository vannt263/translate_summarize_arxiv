    "one of the unique features of the annihilation of stopped antiprotons in nuclei is the production of very fast moving baryons .",
    "it was suggested by armenteros and french  @xcite that the high momentum tail of the proton spectra in antiproton annihilation may be ascribed to the annihilation involving more than one nucleon . as was found by hernandes and oset  @xcite that a sizable increase of the fast moving nucleons are produced by the many - body annihilation mechanism .",
    "furthermore , cugnon et al .",
    "@xcite suggested that the production of fast moving strange baryons implies the two - body annihilation mechanism .",
    "however , a quite different mechanism of fast protons formation was suggested by kudryavtsev and tarasov  @xcite.they suggest that the fast protons are produced in antiproton - deuteron annihilations due to pion absorption on the recoiling nucleon .",
    "moreover the protons with very high momenta may be produced from the absorption and the emission of a meson by a baryon resonance .",
    "one of the traditional mechanisms of fast baryon production following the antiproton annihilation is the secondary interactions of the pions as well as the mesonic resonances in the nuclear environment .",
    "it was shown by sibirtsev  @xcite that the high momentum tail of the proton spectra from carbon and uranium targets can be reproduced with the rescattering and absorption of the annihilation mesons .",
    "fasano et al .",
    "@xcite found that the pion rescattering can explain the fast proton production in the reaction @xmath5 but strongly underestimates the proton spectrum from reaction @xmath6 .",
    "it is clear that an essential indication for the contribution of the meson rescattering is the excitation of the @xmath0-resonances .",
    "obviously the direct experimental evidence of secondary interactions of the mesons produced from annihilation is the observation of the isobar structure in the effective mass of the @xmath2-system .",
    "the search for isobar was performed in @xmath1 annihilation by kalogeropoulos et al .",
    "@xcite , but they found no @xmath0 influence in @xmath2-system .",
    "however as was later shown by voronov and kolybasov  @xcite analyzing the reaction @xmath7 that the structure of the isobar may be significantly smeared out due to the contribution from @xmath2-pairs in which the pion does not undergo rescattering .",
    "moreover it was suggested that the @xmath0-resonance can be observed only when the recoil nucleons are selected with momenta above 200 mev / c .",
    "recently the obelix collaboration from cern measured the annihilation of stopped antiprotons in a deutron target  @xcite",
    ". the invariant mass of protons with momenta larger than 400 mev / c and @xmath8-mesons indicates a clean peak from @xmath9-resonances , whereas the @xmath10-resonance in the @xmath4 system was not found .",
    "presently the isobar production in antiproton - deuteron annihilation is measured with respect to the different final channels  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we study the @xmath0-excitation in @xmath1 annihilation at rest . the dependence of the @xmath9-production on the pion multiplicity is analyzed and the invariant mass of the @xmath2-system for the reaction channels are predicted .",
    "similar to  @xcite we calculate the amplitude of the triangle diagram shown in fig.1 as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the amplitude of @xmath13 annihilation , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the pion and the proton energies in the final state , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the pion momenta before and after the interaction . here",
    "@xmath18 is the nucleon mass and @xmath19 is the deutron momentum .",
    "the deutron wave function @xmath20 for the bonn potential  @xcite was adopted .",
    "we use the annihilation probability from  @xcite as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the squared invariant mass of @xmath23 system and @xmath24 is the klen function .",
    "factor @xmath25 stands for the charge configuration of the final system of @xmath26-pions and was calculated with the statistical approach as  @xcite @xmath27^{-1 }   \\left [ \\sum_{\\beta } \\left(n_+ !",
    "\\right)_{\\beta}^{-1 } \\right]^{-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the numbers of positive , negative and neutral @xmath31-mesons for a final charge system of @xmath32 pions and the summation is performed over all reaction channels allowed for a given @xmath33 system .",
    "let us note , that the more complicated expression for @xmath25 suggested in  @xcite is quite similar to the statistical factor  ( [ stat ] ) .    in eq.([am1 ] ) the factor @xmath34 accounts for the phase space volume of @xmath26-pions with invariant mass @xmath35 and @xmath36 stands for the probability for the creation of @xmath26-pions in @xmath23 annihilation , which was taken as  @xcite @xmath37 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\nu = 2.65 + 1.78 lns , \\ \\ \\",
    "\\sigma=0.174 \\nu s^{0.2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which are different from @xmath38 and @xmath39 suggested in  @xcite for the annihilation at rest , but as we studied  @xcite do not change the results noticably .    accordingly to hernandez et al .",
    "@xcite the annihilation amplitude has a smooth momentum dependence and the momentum distribution of the pions are described by the @xmath26-body phase space .",
    "the @xmath40 amplitude accounts for the @xmath41 scattering in the @xmath0-isobar region and was calculated with the resonance model  @xcite .",
    "the cut - off parameter @xmath42 was fitted to the experimental data of the total cross section for the @xmath3 interaction  @xcite ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "the lines show our calculations with the resonance model and the parameters @xmath43=0.3 gev solid , 0.35 gev dashed , 0.4 gev dotted and 0.5 gev dashed - dotted line . in the futher calculations we use @xmath42=0.33 gev .    with fig.3",
    "we demonstrate how reasonable the resonance model reproduces the angular spectra of the @xmath31-mesons . here",
    "the dots show the experimental data on the differential cross sections of the reaction @xmath44 plotted as a function of the @xmath45 in the c.m.s .",
    "the squares show the results for @xmath46 gev@xmath47  @xcite , the triangles for 1.474  @xcite and the circles for 1.711  @xcite .",
    "the solid , dashed and dotted lines show our results calculated with the resonance model .",
    "the dashed - dotted line shows the function @xmath48 which is valid in the central @xmath0-resonance region .",
    "our results obtained with the resonance model are also in reasonable agreement with the legendre expansions of the differential cross sections calculated from the karlsruhe - helsinki partial wave solution .",
    "the invariant mass distribution of the @xmath3 system produced in the annihilation of antiprotons on the deuteron at rest in the reaction @xmath49 are shown in fig.4 .",
    "the experimental data were taken from  @xcite .",
    "similar as in ref .",
    "@xcite we select the protons with momenta above 400 mev / c .",
    "the dashed line shows the @xmath9-resonance , whereas the dotted line shows the combinatorial backround that comes from the pions which do not undergo interactions .",
    "the solid line is the sum and describes reasonably the experimental data .",
    "note that the isobar resonance is slightly shifted to a higher mass in our calculations , which is due to the selection of the fast protons with momenta above 400 mev / c .",
    "surprisingly this obvious feature was not observed in the experimental study  @xcite .",
    "the isobar structure is very clearly detected and reconstructed from the total invariant mass spectrum .    in fig.5",
    "we show the contribution from the isobar ( a ) and the bakground ( b ) calculated for the reaction @xmath49 for @xmath50 dotted , for @xmath51 dashed , for @xmath52 solid and for @xmath53 dashed - dotted line .",
    "it is clear that the dominant contribution comes from the reaction channels with one and two neutral pions in the final state .",
    "the contribution to the @xmath0-excitation in the reaction @xmath54 is negligible , because the pions created in the annihilation have momenta which lead with a nucleon the excitations above the @xmath0 resonance region .    a quite different situation exists for the @xmath4 invariant mass spectrum from the reaction @xmath49 , which is shown in fig.6 .",
    "the signal from the @xmath10 resonance is to weak to be extracted from strong combinatorial background .    with our model",
    "we can also predict the isobar structure in the reaction channels which are now under study at cern .",
    "fig.7a shows the @xmath3 invariant mass spectrum from the reaction @xmath55 .",
    "again we select protons with momenta above 400 mev / c .",
    "although the contribution from @xmath9 is strong , it might be a difficult problem to extract it from the total spectrum , shown as the solid line .",
    "in fig.7b we show the @xmath3 invariant mass spectrum from the reaction @xmath56 . the isobar structure can be clearly seen .",
    "the @xmath0-excitation in @xmath1 annihilation at rest was studied .",
    "we use the annihilation amplitude from the statistical model  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 amplitude was calculated with the resonance model accounting only for the @xmath57 resonance .",
    "we calculate the invariant mass of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 systems selecting the fast protons with momenta above 400 mev / c .",
    "we reasonably reproduce the new experimental data from the obelix collaboration at cern .",
    "we found that the @xmath10 structure can not be observed in the @xmath4 invariant mass spectrum because of the strong contribution from the combinatorial background , in which the pions do not undergo an interaction .",
    "most promising is to study the @xmath9 excitation in the reactions @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "we also predicted that the observation of the @xmath9 resonance in the reaction @xmath56 is significantly easier than with the reaction @xmath55 .",
