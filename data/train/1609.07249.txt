    "quantum systems in contact with an environment display a very rich physics including emergence of non - equilibrium phase transitions @xcite which can be used to engineer particularly interesting non - equilibrium steady states ( ness ) . moreover , also the relaxation towards an asymptotic or steady state can , for example , manifest a non - trivial dynamics , from power - law to stretched exponentials and even aging @xcite .",
    "a particularly important class of open quantum system is that of boundary driven systems , in which a current may be induced by the coupling , only at the extremities , of the system to the environment .",
    "this class of systems is of particular relevance in the study of quantum transport .",
    "the knowledge of analytical solutions for open quantum systems would allow to build a better intuition of the physics of these systems and to test numerical methods .",
    "the ness of a boundary driven heisenberg model can , in many regimes , be computed analytically using a matrix product ansatz as shown in @xcite ( for a review see @xcite ) . in @xcite an exact solution for a diffusive xx chain is presented using a cleverly designed ansatz . for a boundary driven bosonic non - interacting system , in @xcite the authors showed how to analytically compute the local densities and the current . in the seminal article @xcite , which is particularly relevant to our work , prosen showed that for a quadratic open fermionic model with @xmath0 sites , solving for the relaxation rates of the quantum lindblad equation , can be reduced to the diagonalization of a @xmath2 anti - symmetric matrix .    here",
    "we build on this strategy while focusing on a boundary dissipative driven quadratic bosonic system .",
    "we are able to reduce the problem to the diagonalization of a @xmath1 matrix which can thus be studied numerically more effectively . in the second part of this work we will consider the case of fermions . here",
    "we show that in many physically relevant cases the matrix to be diagonalized is a tridiagonal bordered toeplitz matrix for which analytical expressions for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are known .",
    "we also show an example for which we can explicitly write the relaxation rates ( rapidities ) of all the normal master modes of the lindblad master equation .",
    "this can be used , for example , to compute the relaxation gap , that is the rapidity of the slowest decaying normal master mode .",
    "last we use the framework developed to give an expression for the steady state .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : model ] we introduce the quadratic bosonic model we study . in section [ sec : diagonalization ] , we show how to diagonalize the lindblad master equation and obtain the normal master modes . in section [ sec : exact ] we show how to solve analytically the boundary driven bosonic chain and study the scaling of the relaxation gap . in section [ sec : algorithm ] , we introduce an efficient numerical algorithm to compute the quadratic observables such as currents and densities which we then use to study the relaxation gap of systems which present non - equilibrium phase transitions . in section [ sec : steady_state ] we analytically construct a similarity transformation which maps the vacuum state to the steady state of the system and in section [ sec : conclusion ] , we draw our conclusions .",
    "we consider an open quantum systems of @xmath0 sites with bosonic particles .",
    "its dynamics is described by the quantum lindblad master equation @xcite with lindbladian @xmath3 @xmath4 + \\mathcal{d}({\\hat{\\rho } } ) .",

    "the hamiltonian @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is an @xmath11 hermitian matrix , and @xmath12(@xmath13 ) creates(annihilates )",
    "one boson on site @xmath14 .",
    "the dissipative part is given by @xmath15,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are @xmath1 hermitian and non - negative matrices .",
    "we perform a one - to - one mapping the density operator basis elements @xmath18 to a state vector basis ( with @xmath19 sites ) @xmath20 ( see for example @xcite ) . from this ,",
    "the operator @xmath21 acting on site @xmath22 on the left of the density matrix is mapped to @xmath23 acting on the state vector on the @xmath22-th site , while the operator @xmath21 acting on the right of the density matrix is mapped to @xmath24 acting on the state vector .",
    "we denote the density operator to be @xmath25 in the new representation .",
    "@xmath3 in eq.([eq : first ] ) can thus be written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a @xmath28 matrix , @xmath29 here @xmath30 , where with @xmath31 we indicate the transpose of the matrix @xmath32 .",
    "we have also used the notation @xmath33 to denote the column vector made of operators @xmath34 and @xmath35 for the column vector made of @xmath36 , the same applies for @xmath37 and @xmath38 .      in general @xmath27",
    "is not hermitian and it can not always be diagonalized , however in the following we start from the assumption that we know a transformation which can diagonalize @xmath27 and preserves bosonic commutation relations . this assumption is a posteriori verified in all the cases we considered .",
    "this transformation is given by the matrices @xmath39 and @xmath40 as follows @xmath41 where as for @xmath42 and @xmath43 , @xmath44 means the column vector made of operators @xmath45 and @xmath46 means the column vector made of @xmath47 .",
    "again the same notation applies for @xmath48 and @xmath49 .    using this transformation we get @xmath50 the bosonic commutation relation",
    "can be written as @xmath51 = { \\bold{z}}_l,\\ ] ] and requiring for the bosonic commutation relation to apply also to the @xmath52 we get @xmath53 = { \\bold{z}}_l\\ ] ] and hence @xmath54 here we have used @xmath55 where we have denoted @xmath56 for an identity matrix of size @xmath57 . in the following",
    "we will also use the matrices @xmath58 and @xmath59 matrices in eqs.([eq : eqz ] , [ eq : eqx ] , [ eq : eqy ] ) , being given by a tensor product between pauli matrices and identity , satisfy the relations @xmath60    it follows that @xmath61 this implies that the problem of finding the normal modes of the system reduces to finding a @xmath39 such that @xmath62 can be diagonalized , that is , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a diagonal matrix with the elements of the vector @xmath65 on its diagonal .",
    "it would then be possible to write the following compact form for @xmath3 : @xmath66      here we will explicitly construct the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath62 . from eq.([eq : mm ] ) we note that the relation @xmath67 we find that if @xmath68 is a right eigenvector of @xmath69 with eigenvalue @xmath70 , then @xmath71 is a left eigenvector of @xmath69 with eigenvalue @xmath72 .",
    "in fact , using eq.([eq : xandz ] ) @xmath73 this implies , using eq.([eq : y ] ) , that @xmath74 , which means @xmath75 .",
    "thus it follows that @xmath76 i.e. @xmath77 is a left eigenvector of @xmath69 .    moreover",
    "if @xmath78 is a right eigenvector of @xmath69 with eigenvalue @xmath79 , and @xmath80 is a right eigenvector of @xmath81 with eigenvalue @xmath82 , then if @xmath83 it follows that @xmath84 .",
    "in fact @xmath85 then @xmath86    since the eigenvalues of @xmath62 always appear in pairs , we could list the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors of @xmath62 as @xmath87 , with the matrix @xmath39 composed in each column by the right eigenvectors @xmath88 . then following eq.([eq : lefteigen ] )",
    "we know that @xmath89 is the left eigenvector of @xmath62 correponds to @xmath90 , and @xmath91 is the left eigenvector corresponds to @xmath92 , for @xmath93",
    ". therefore the left eigenvectors of @xmath62 constitute the matrix @xmath94",
    ". we can now choose to renormalize the right eigenvectors as @xmath95 so that we have @xmath96    at this point we define a new @xmath11 matrix @xmath97 , which satisfies @xmath98 for which we assume to have the eigendecomposition @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are eigenvectors and eigenvalues .",
    "then we find that the @xmath102 matrix formed by @xmath103 constitutes @xmath0 right eigenvectors of @xmath62 , corresponding to @xmath101 , and the @xmath104 matrix @xmath105 constitutes @xmath0 left eigenvectors of @xmath62 , corresponding to @xmath106 .",
    "this can be shown from @xmath107 and @xmath108 hence by denoting the remaining @xmath0 right eigenvectors of @xmath62 as @xmath109 , where @xmath110 @xmath111 are @xmath11 matrices , we know that they form the right eigenvectors with eigenvalues @xmath106 , which are paired with the left eigenvectors @xmath112 . also @xmath113 will be the left eigenvectors corresponding the eigenvalues @xmath101 , which are paired with the right eigenvectors @xmath103 .",
    "therefore @xmath39 and @xmath40 can be written more explicitly as @xmath114 which means    @xmath115    [ eq : atob ]    and the inverse equation    @xmath116    [ eq : btoa ]    noticing that @xmath117/2 $ ] and since the @xmath118 correspond to @xmath119 , the eigenvalues of @xmath62 , we get the following identity @xmath120 which exactly cancels the last term in the expression of @xmath3 in eq.([eq : me_beta ] ) .    we can then write @xmath3 as @xmath121 the state @xmath122 which annihilates all the operator @xmath123 is the steady state because @xmath124 .",
    "the @xmath125 are the normal master modes of the lindblad master equation and the @xmath126 the rapidities .      to prove the eigenvalues of @xmath3 are non - positive , it is sufficient to prove that all the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath97 are non - positive .",
    "the proof is similar as in @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath127 , therefore @xmath128 , then we have @xmath129 where @xmath130 means the real part of @xmath70 .",
    "moreover @xmath131 hence all the eigenvalues of the matrix on the right - hand side have to be non - positive for the master equation to have a steady state .",
    "hence we can conclude that @xmath132 i.e. the real part of eigenvalues of the lindbladian is non - positive .",
    "we denote @xmath134 to be the state vector resulting from the mapping of an identity operator , and @xmath135 to be its transpose .",
    "computing the expectation value of observable @xmath136 on the steady state @xmath137 , which is @xmath138 , is equivalent to the expression @xmath139 where we have simply re - written the trace of an operator times the density operator in the enlarged space . of course the operator",
    "@xmath136 has also been mapped to the new space . in order to compute quadratic expectation values such as @xmath140",
    "it is convenient to rewrite the eigenequation eq.([eq : eigeneq ] ) in a different form .",
    "to do so we start from @xmath141 and using eq.([eq : w1 ] ) , we have @xmath142 where @xmath143 is a @xmath1 hermitian matrix .",
    "therefore @xmath39 can also be written as @xmath144 from eq.([eq : eigeneq ] ) , which can be written now as @xmath145 and using eq.([eq : w1sol ] ) , together with @xmath146 we have @xmath147 solving this equation for @xmath148 will prove very useful in the following .      using eqs.([eq : atob ] ) we get @xmath150 for @xmath151 . using this we can write @xmath152 we then show that @xmath135 is annihilated by all the operators @xmath153 .",
    "it is actually sufficient to prove it for all the @xmath154 because the @xmath155 have the same structure .",
    "taking @xmath156 , and using eq.([eq : btoa ] ) , we have @xmath157 hence , computing the trace of eq.([eq : aiaj ] ) we find that only the last term does not vanish and gives @xmath158 the observable matrix @xmath159 is then given by @xmath160",
    "here we apply our method to directly obtain the spectrum of eq.([eq : master ] ) for a class of linear chains ( lc ) which can then be solved analytically in the limit of a long chain .",

    "instead , for the line given by eq.([eq : totcurtransition ] ) the low energy spectrum is not qualitatively changed , instead a gap opens ( see @xcite ) .",
    "while the opening of the gap affects the total and chiral currents , it does not change the scaling of the relaxation gap . at the intersection point between the two transition lines",
    "the scaling is indeed @xmath275 .",
    "from eq.([eq : llambdap ] ) we understand that the steady state of the system is the vacuum of the operators @xmath276 , that is @xmath277 .",
    "this is related to the vacuum of the @xmath278 , @xmath279 , by a linear transformation .",
    "we can then write @xmath280    in the following we show how to compute @xmath281 from @xmath39 .",
    "first we write @xmath282 , where @xmath283 is @xmath284 where @xmath285 are @xmath11 matrix .",
    "hereafter we will write @xmath286 to calculate @xmath287 and @xmath288 , we use the relations @xmath289_m \\nonumber \\\\ & \\hat{f } : =   e^{\\hat{t}}{\\hat{a}}_{l+j } e^{-\\hat{t } } = \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{m!}\\left[{\\hat{t}},{\\hat{a}}_{l+j}\\right]_m   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the nested commutator is defined recursively as @xmath290_{m+1 } \\equiv [ \\hat{a},[\\hat{a},\\hat{b}]_{m } ] $ ] with @xmath290_0 \\equiv \\hat{b}$ ] . after a little algebra",
    "it is possible to show that @xmath291 similarly , we have @xmath292 we now denote @xmath293 , and we see that @xmath294 which allows us to write @xmath295 therefore we have that @xmath296 thus we see that if we set @xmath297 which means @xmath298 then following from eq.([eq : me_beta ] ) and the explicit construction of @xmath39 in sec.[sec : diagonalization ] , eq.([eq : sls ] ) can be simply written as @xmath299 it follows that the vacuum @xmath300 is the steady state of @xmath301 which implies that the steady state of @xmath3 is given by eq.([eq : steadystate ] ) .",
    "since @xmath39 is given by eq.([eq : logofeigenspace ] ) , we can also reconstruct @xmath283 from eq.([eq : top ] ) .",
    "we have shown how to map the problem of computing the relaxation rates and the normal master modes of a lindblad master equation for dissipatively boundary driven uniform non - interacting bosons chain , to the diagonalization of a tridiagonal bordered toeplitz matrix .",
    "this special structure of the matrix also allows to find explicit analytical solutions and we have shown an approximate solution for a large system . with",
    "the approach presented , for a system of size @xmath0 , the matrix to be diagonalized is only of size @xmath11 ( when considering hamiltonians which conserve the total number of particles , i.e. there are no terms of the type @xmath302 or @xmath303 ) . for more general hamiltonians",
    "our approach can be readily extended , however the matrix to be diagonalized would be a @xmath28 block bordered toeplitz matrix ( for uniform bulk hamiltonian with boundary dissipative driving ) which can not be diagonalized with the same analytical formulae .",
    "the method here presented can be useful to study both the time evolution ( since it gives access to all the normal master modes and rapidities ) and steady states for open bosonic systems far from equilibrium .",
    "due to its simplicity , this method allows one to find more analytically solvable solutions .",
    "we have also proposed a numerical algorithm which can efficiently compute observables of the type @xmath304 .",
    "we have then used this method to compute the relaxation gap of a boundary driven bosonic quadratic system which presents two different non - equilibrium phase transitions .",
    "a scaling analysis of the gap shows that the gap scale as @xmath215 in all the parameter space except at one of the two phase transitions , for which the relaxation gap scales as @xmath305 .",
    "this is due to the different behavior of the spectrum of the hamiltonian of the bulk of the system at the two transition points .",
