    "quantum turbulence @xcite consists of a disordered tangle of reconnecting quantized vortex filaments , each carrying one quantum of circulation @xmath3 .",
    "this form of turbulence is easily created by agitating superfluid liquid helium ( @xmath4he ) with propellers @xcite , forks@xcite , or grids @xcite , the same techniques which are used to create turbulence in ordinary fluids .",
    "there are also methods which are unique to superfluid liquid helium , for example heat flows @xcite and streams of ions @xcite .",
    "quantum turbulence is also studied in superfluid @xmath5he - b @xcite and , more recently , in atomic bose - einstein condensates@xcite . in the study of quantum turbulence , particular attention is devoted to the similarities with ordinary turbulence @xcite .",
    "recent progress has been boosted by the development of new flow visualization techniques , such as tracer particles@xcite , andreev scattering @xcite and laser - induced fluorescence@xcite .",
    "this article is concerned with numerical simulations of quantum turbulence .",
    "starting from the pioneering work of schwarz @xcite , numerical simulations have always played an important role in the field @xcite .",
    "the recent experimental progress , rather than reducing the need of numerical simulations , has highlighted their importance in interpreting visualization methods @xcite .    in superfluid",
    "@xmath4he , the vortex core radius ( @xmath6 ) is many orders of magnitude smaller than the average separation between vortex lines ( typically from @xmath7 to @xmath8 ) or any other relevant length scale in the flow .",
    "this feature was early recognised by schwarz@xcite , who proposed to model vortex lines as spaces curves @xmath9 of infinitesimal thickness , where @xmath10 is the time and @xmath11 is arc length .",
    "this vortex filament approach is also valid in @xmath5he - b , although to a lesser extent because the core size is larger ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the space curves are numerically discretized by a large , variable number of points @xmath13 ( @xmath14 , which hereafter we refer to as vortex points .    at temperatures low enough that the normal fluid and mutual friction is negligible , the governing equation of motion of the superfluid vortex lines is the biot - savart ( bs ) law @xcite    @xmath15    where the line integral extends over the entire vortex configuration @xmath16 .",
    "( [ eq : bs ] ) formulates the classical euler dynamics of vortex filaments in incompressible inviscid flows .",
    "the assumption of incompressibility is justified , as all relevant speeds , of the order of few cm / s , are much smaller than the speed of sound , which is approximately @xmath17 ( but see the discussion of reconnections and dissipation in section [ sec : algo ] ) . unlike vortex lines in classical inviscid euler flows , however",
    ", superfluid vortex lines can reconnect with each other when they come sufficiently close @xcite .",
    "this effect is captured by a more microscopic model , the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) for a bose - einstein condensate@xcite . in the context of the vortex filament approach",
    ", reconnections are modelled by supplementing eq .",
    "( [ eq : bs ] ) with an algorithmical reconnection procedure , as originally proposed by schwarz @xcite .",
    "two difficulties arise in seeking a numerical solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bs ] ) .",
    "firstly eq .",
    "( [ eq : bs ] ) is singular at @xmath18 . following schwarz @xcite , to circumvent this problem we split the velocity of the filament of the @xmath19 vortex point @xmath13 into a local contribution ( near the singularity ) and non - local contributions",
    ", writing    @xmath20    here a prime denotes a derivative with respect to arc length ( hence @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the arclengths of the curves between points @xmath25 and @xmath13 and between @xmath13 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the original vortex configuration @xmath16 without the section between @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and @xmath28 is a cutoff parameter . for simplicity",
    ", hereafter we assume that the cutoff parameter is equal to the vortex core radius , @xmath29 .    to numerically calculate the nonlocal term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bs_desing ] ) , we must perform further manipulations .",
    "we follow @xcite and split the integral into discrete parts , which account for the contribution of the vortex between points along @xmath27 . assuming a straight line between vortex points , the contribution to the nonlocal term due to the vortex segment between points @xmath30 and @xmath31 is given by , @xmath32\\mathbf{p } \\times \\mathbf{q}.\\ ] ] where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 . the total nonlocal contribution",
    "is then found by summing over all @xmath38 .",
    "the second difficulty , which we address in this paper , is the computational cost of the bs law .",
    "it is apparent from eq .",
    "( [ eq : bs ] ) that the velocity at one vortex point depends on an integral over all other @xmath39 points , so the cpu time required to evolve the vortex configuration in time scales as @xmath40 . because of this cost , it has been difficult to numerically calculate vortex tangles with vortex line density @xmath41 ( vortex length per unit volume ) comparable to what is achieved in experiments .",
    "similarly , it has been difficult to perform sufficiently long numerical calculations which are needed , for example , to saturate the initial vortex configuration to a steady state tangle , or to produce long time series suitable for spectral analysis , or to study the decay of quantum turbulence .",
    "schwarz @xcite proposed the local induction approximation ( lia ) @xcite as a practical alternative to the exact ( but cpu - intensive ) bs law . neglecting the second non - local term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bs_desing ] ) , we have simply    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is a constant of order unity and @xmath44 is the mean radius of curvature of the vortex filament .",
    "the lia greatly increases the efficiency of the numerical code because its computational cost scales with @xmath2 , as opposed to @xmath1 for the bs law .",
    "moreover the lia offers insight into vortex dynamics . using lia ,",
    "it is easy to show that , in the first approximation , the motion of a point on the vortex filament is along the direction which is binormal to the filament at that point , with speed which is inversely proportional to the local radius of curvature @xmath45 .",
    "moreover the lia describes well the translational motion of a circular vortex ring and the rotation of a small amplitude kelvin wave .",
    "unfortunately , the lia does not capture the interaction between two vortex filaments , and the interaction which different parts of the same vortex have on each other .",
    "for example , two circular vortex rings , set coaxially close to each other , move in a leapfrogging fashion , but the effect is ignored by the lia . other limitations of the lia have been discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "clearly the lia is not the best tool to study important properties of turbulence which arise from the vortex interaction , such as how the energy is distributed over the length scales ( the kolmogorov spectrum ) .    in a recent paper @xcite we presented the spectrum of vortex density fluctuations in superfluid turbulence and",
    "compared it to experiments .",
    "this calculation was possible because we used a tree algorithm , which retains the long - range interaction of the bs law , but sensibly approximate it , so that its computational cost scaled as @xmath0 rather than @xmath1 .",
    "the difference between @xmath1 and @xmath0 can not be overstated : it is the same improvement of the fast fourier transform .",
    "for example , in the work reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , the typical number of vortex points which we used was of the order of @xmath46 .",
    "tree algorithms are popular in astrophysical n - body simulations @xcite .",
    "the numerical solution of the gravitational interaction of @xmath2 bodies , in fact , has the same difficulty of the bs law : the motion of one body depends on the other @xmath39 bodies , hence the computational cost scales as @xmath1 , as for vortex points .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present a detailed description of a tree algorithm tailored to vortex dynamics , provide quantitative error estimates associated with the method , and compare results with methods used in the literature .",
    "in particular we show that the tree method provides huge computational savings but without the inherent errors associated with the lia .",
    "the structure of the article is as follows .",
    "section [ sec : tree ] outlines the algorithms and methods required to create a tree structure for a set of points embedded in three - dimensional space .",
    "we pay careful attention to how this tree structure can be efficiently used to compute the velocity at a particular vortex point . in section [ sec : algo ] we provide further details on the algorithms required to apply the vortex filament method to the study of quantised turbulence .",
    "section [ sec : tree_test ] contains the results of numerical tests of the tree algorithm .",
    "we show that the @xmath1 scaling inherent in the evaluation of the bs integral can be approximated , with a tolerable loss of accuracy , by a tree method which exhibits an improved @xmath47 scaling .",
    "a recent , and very detailed , numerical study of counterflow turbulence by adachi _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite as again demonstrated that the lia is unsuitable for the study of quantum turbulence . in section [ sec : counterflow ] we verify that the tree method does not exhibit the same deficiencies of the lia .    in all simulations",
    "presented , here we use parameters which refer to superfluid @xmath4he : circulation @xmath48 and vortex core radius @xmath49 .",
    "all our results and methods , however , can be generalised to vortex systems in low temperature @xmath5he - b .",

    "the points ( blue dots ) are enclosed in the root cell ( a ) , which is divided into four cells of half size ( b ) , until ( c , d ) there is only one point per cell.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    building on the pioneering work of barnes and hut @xcite , the majority of astrophysical and cosmological n - body simulations have made use of tree algorithms to enhance the efficiency of the simulation with a relatively small loss in accuracy @xcite .",
    "the advantages of these methods are two - fold .",
    "firstly they have been shown to scale as @xmath50 , where @xmath2 is the number of particles used in the simulation .",
    "secondly there are now openly available parallel implementations of the tree algorithm , which have been used to compute simulations with up to 10 billion particles @xcite .",
    "our implementation of the tree algorithm for vortex dynamics is limited to a serial program , however the development of a parallel scheme is one of our future aims .",
    "we are not the first to apply tree methods to quantised vortex simulations .",
    "kivotedes @xcite used a tree method to enhance a vortex filament simulation , but did not provide any description , testing and evaluation of the performance of the method .",
    "kozik and svistunov @xcite introduced an interesting method to speed up the simulation of the kelvin wave cascade along quantised vortices using a scale separation scheme . whilst this is a significant improvement over the full bs integral the problem discussed in @xcite is inherently one - dimensional and it is not clear if there is an efficient implementation of the scheme that would enhance the speed of a three dimensional simulation",
    ".    detailed descriptions of the tree algorithm can be found in a number of works @xcite , but their focus is on astrophysical simulations . in this paper",
    "we provide a detailed description of the method which is accessible to the fluid dynamics and the quantum turbulence community .            at each time - step",
    "we have a set of orientated vortex points which represent the current position and direction of the vortex filaments .",
    "we first group the vortex points into a hierarchy of cubes which is arranged in a three - dimensional octree structure .",
    "the octree can be either be constructed top down or bottom up .",
    "we think that it is conceptually easier to work from the top down , repeatedly dividing the domain . to achieve this aim",
    ", we first divide the full computational box , the root cell , into eight cubes , and then continue to divide each cube into eight smaller ` children ' cubes , until either a cube is empty or contains only one vortex point .",
    "the numerical code , qvort we have developed is written in fortran 2003 and employs linked lists @xcite to efficiently create the tree structure . in the code",
    "each cell in the tree is a node which , using pointers , links to the 8 children within the domain of the parent node .",
    "the main node is set to the full computational box , we then repeatedly call a recursive subroutine to allocate the points in this box to the main nodes child cells",
    ". this process is then repeated dividing the main nodes child cells until the hierarchical tree structure is created .     a cartoon of the calculation of the centre of circulation ( green ) triangle and the total circulation bold gray arrow .",
    "the ( red ) circles mark the position of the vortex points within a tree cell and the black line gives a representation of the vortex filament.,scaledwidth=50.0%,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    as we create the tree , we calculate the total circulation contained within each cube and the ` center of circulation ' using the points that the cube contains .",
    "we denote the number of points the cube contains as @xmath51 , then the total circulation is given by @xmath52 likewise the center of circulation is calculated as , @xmath53 a schematic diagram for these quantities is displayed in fig [ fig : circ_cent ] .    the time required for constructing the tree scales as @xmath54 , so it feasible ( and essential ) to `",
    "redraw ' the tree at each time - step .",
    "[ fig : treecartoon ] illustrates this procedure in two dimensions for clarity .",
    "[ fig : octree ] shows the complex nature of the octree required for a single vortex ring in a three - dimensional calculation .",
    "the enhanced speed of the tree method appears when we calculate the induced velocity at each vortex point @xmath13 . as opposed to the bs method , we only take the full contribution of points near to the vortex point in question .",
    "the induced velocity from far vortex points is an average contribution , hence the number of evaluations required per point is significantly smaller than @xmath39 .",
    "therefore for each point we must ` walk ' the tree , and decide if a cell in the octree is sufficiently far .",
    "this is done using the concept of the opening angle @xmath55 . in their original work @xcite , barnes & hut calculated @xmath55 by evaluating the distance of the center of vorticity from @xmath13 , which we denote as @xmath56 . since each cube in the octree has a known width @xmath57 , then the opening angle is @xmath58 .",
    "we then must define a critical ( or maximum ) opening angle @xmath59 .",
    "if @xmath60 we accept the cube , and its contribution is used in computing the nonlocal contribution to the velocity via eq .",
    "( [ eq : bs_schwarz_nl ] ) .",
    "the crucial difference between the full bs law and the tree approximation is that the vectors @xmath61 and @xmath62 must be redefined as @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "if @xmath65 then each cell contains one point at the most , and it is clear that @xmath66 , @xmath67 and we recover @xmath61 and @xmath62 used in the full bs integral as one would expect .",
    "if @xmath68 , then we open the cube ( assuming it contains more that one vortex point ) and repeat the test on each of the child cubes that it contains . as a link list is used , from a programming point of view , it is relatively easy to start at the main node and follow the separate branches of the tree , at each stage evaluating whether the cells contribution can be used .",
    "the tree - walk ends when the contributions of all cubes have been evaluated .",
    "we note that the adjacent points are exempt from this walk , and their contribution is taken as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bs_desing ] ) so as to avoid the singularity .",
    "a correction to this method was proposed by barnes@xcite to avoid errors which would arise if the center of vorticity is near the edge of the cube .",
    "this requires the calculation of the distance from the center of vorticity and the geometrical center of the cube , which we denote as @xmath69 .",
    "the test criteria then becomes @xmath70 . in section [ sec : tree_test ] we evaluate the improvement caused by this new criterion .",
    "whatever opening criterion is used , it is crucial to have a reasonable choice for @xmath59 . if @xmath59 is too large , the discrepancy between the full bs integral and the tree approximation will damage to the accuracy of the simulation . in section [ sec : tree_test ]",
    "we shall also show how the errors in the calculation of the velocity at the vortex points depends on @xmath59 .    in the next section",
    "we describe other necessary details of the vortex filament method which we used .",
    "the numerical simulations presented here use a @xmath71 order adams  bashforth scheme .",
    "given an evolution equation of the form @xmath72 , the recursion formula is    @xmath73    where @xmath74 is the time - step and the superscript @xmath75 refers to the time @xmath76 @xmath77 .",
    "lower order schemes are used for the initial steps of the calculations , when older velocity values are not available .    as the vortex points move , the separation between neighbours along the same filament is not constant . in general",
    "this is not a problem , as we can use finite - difference schemes which work with an adaptive mesh size .",
    "however the distance between points sets the resolution of the calculation , therefore we must set some upper - bound on the distance between vortex points before we re - mesh the filaments by introducing new vortex points .",
    "our criterion is the following : if the separation between two vortex points , @xmath78 and @xmath26 , becomes greater than some threshold quantity @xmath79 ( which we call the minimum resolution ) , we introduce a new vortex point at position @xmath80 given by    @xmath81    where @xmath82 . in this way",
    "@xmath83 , that is to say the insertion of new vortex points preserves the curvature .",
    "this property is desirable , as the curvature of the filament directly affects the velocity field via eq .",
    "( [ eq : bs_desing ] ) .",
    "our procedure is thus superior to simpler linear interpolation .",
    "conversely , vortex points are removed if their separation becomes less than @xmath84 , ensuring that the shortest length - scale of the calculation remains fixed .",
    "this property is important , as the maximum time - step which can be used is related to this length - scale . in the long - wavelength approximation ( @xmath85 ) , the angular frequency of a kelvin wave , along a straight vortex is @xmath86,\\ ] ] where",
    "@xmath87 is euler s constant .",
    "hence the timescale for the fastest motions , with a maximum wavenumber @xmath88 , is @xmath89 thus a reasonable maximum time - step that can be used is given by @xmath90 we note that at finite temperatures this condition may be relaxed as mutual friction will tend to dampen kelvin waves .",
    "setting a consistent minimum separation between vortex points makes the numerical resolution of the calculation transparent , and prevents the creation of too short length - scales which would considerably slow down the calculation .    in order to model any turbulent system",
    "we must pay particular attention to the dissipation of kinetic energy . even at very low temperatures , in the absence of mutual friction with the normal fluid , there are still mechanisms which dissipate the kinetic energy of quantised vortices : reconnections , decay of very small vortex loops and direct phonon emission .    using the gpe condensate model , leadbeater & al @xcite showed that , at vortex reconnection events , a small amount of kinetic energy is transformed into acoustic energy of a rarefaction pulse which moves away .",
    "since our model neglects sound waves and it would be impractical to determine with accuracy very small changes of kinetic energy , we interpret this dissipation of kinetic energy as a reduction of vortex length , essentially using length as a proxy for energy .",
    "we model reconnection events algorithmically in the following way .",
    "if two discretization points , which are not neighbours , become closer to each other than the local discretization distance , a numerical algorithm reconnects the two filaments by simply switching flags for the vortex points in front and behind the filament , subject to the criterion that the total length decreases .",
    "self - reconnections ( which can arise if a vortex filament has twisted and coiled by a large amount ) are treated in the same way .",
    "since reconnections involve only anti - parallel filaments , prior to reconnection we form local ( unit ) tangent vectors @xmath91 , and , using the inner product , we check that the two filaments are not parallel .",
    "clearly , testing for possible reconnections requires a distance evaluation between a vortex point and the vortex points in the vicinity . the most efficient way to do",
    "this is within the tree - walk itself , creating a linked list of all vortex points within a radius of @xmath84 from a vortex point in question .",
    "this avoids the need to re - loop over all discretization points , which would involve approximately @xmath1 operations .",
    "we distinguish two kinds of phonon emissions .",
    "the condensate model shows that very small vortex loops , of radius of the order of @xmath92 , which move at speed close to the speed of sound , are unstable and decay into sound@xcite .",
    "it would not be practical to mesh vortex filaments down to this atomic scale , so we remove any small vortex loop with less than five discretization points .",
    "phonon emission can also be induced by very short kelvin waves which rotate rapidly @xcite . again , since we do not mesh filaments down to this scale , we remove vortex points if the local wavelength is smaller than a specified value @xcite . since our smallest length - scale is maintained at @xmath84 ,",
    "the maximum curvature is of the order of @xmath93 .",
    "we proceed in this way : at each time - step we compute the local curvature @xmath94 at each vortex point .",
    "if , at some location along a vortex filament , the local curvature exceeds the critical value @xmath95 ( @xmath96 of the maximum value @xmath93 ) , this vortex point is removed , smoothing the vortex filament locally .",
    "this loss of length as a proxy of energy is our model of phonon emission in the low temperature limit .",
    "we approximate all spatial derivatives using @xmath97 order finite difference schemes which account for varying mesh sizes along the vortex filaments @xcite .",
    "a high - order scheme is desirable as the spatial derivatives enter into the equation of motion via , eq .",
    "( [ eq : bs_desing ] ) .",
    "let @xmath13 be the @xmath98 point on the vortex filament ; the two points behind have positions @xmath99 and @xmath25 , and the two points in front have positions @xmath26 and @xmath100 .",

    "the computational domain was a cube .",
    "if a vortex point leaves the domain , then it is simply re - inserted at the opposite side of the cube .",
    "the presence of periodic boundary conditions affects the calculation of the distance between two vortex points ( two vortex points point at the opposite end of the domain may be actually close to each other ) .",
    "we must also use periodic ` wrapping ' to ensure that the velocity field is periodic ; in theory we should wrap the cube with an infinite number of copies in all directions . in practice , we only apply a single layer of wrapping , which still requires a very large amount of numerical evaluations .",
    "if we used the bs law , a single layer of wrapping would require @xmath130 evaluations per time - step .",
    "fortunately again the tree method eases the amount of numerical work , as the computational domain is wrapped with copies of the octree we have already computed . walking each of these trees , as well as the tree for the main domain , does not require a significant increase of cpu time",
    "we now test the error associated with the use of the tree approximation , and show that , with an appropriate choice of @xmath59 , the discrepancy between using the tree algorithm and the full bs law is very small .",
