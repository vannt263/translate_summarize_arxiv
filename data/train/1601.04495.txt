    "this chapter is dedicated to superfluidity , and its relation to bose - einstein condensation , a topic with a long history .",
    "many reviews of the concepts of condensation and superfluidity in thermal equilibrium can be found , see for example  refs .",
    "the focus of this chapter is on how these concepts apply ( or fail to apply ) to driven dissipative condensates  systems of bosons with a finite lifetime , in which loss is balanced by continuous pumping .",
    "we focus entirely on the steady state of such systems , neglecting transient , time dependent behaviour .",
    "experimentally , the most studied example of a driven dissipative condensate has been microcavity polaritons ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and chapters ... of this book ) .",
    "however similar issues can arise in many other systems , most obviously photon condensates  @xcite , magnon condensates  @xcite and potentially exciton condensates ( although typical exciton lifetimes are much longer than for polaritons ) .",
    "even experiments on cold atoms could be driven into a regime in which such physics occurs , when considering continuous loading of atoms balancing three - body losses  @xcite or atom laser setups @xcite .",
    "experiments on polaritons are two dimensional , and in two dimensions it is particularly important to clearly distinguish three concepts often erroneously treated as equivalent : superfluidity , condensation , and phase coherence .",
    "this is because no true bose - einstein condensate exists in a homogeneous two - dimensional system . before addressing superfluidity and phase coherence in the steady state of a driven dissipative system , we review in section  [ keeling_sec : superfl - phase - coher ] the essential ideas of condensation , superfluidity and phase coherence for systems in thermal equilibrium . in section  [ keeling_sec : driv - diss - syst ]",
    "we set up a generic microscopic model for weakly interacting driven dissipative bose gases , and make precise the sense in which these systems are non - equilibrium .",
    "section  [ keeling_sec : phase - coher - driv ] reviews the connection of these driven dissipative systems to the kardar - parisi - zhang equation , and explains the absence , for isotropic systems , of algebraic order at large distances based on this mapping . we also show that algebraic order is possible in the strongly anisotropic case .",
    "we frame this discussion in the context of current experiments , which have all been done in the weakly anisotropic regime . in section  [ keeling_sec : superfl - resp - funct ]",
    "we discuss the meaning of superfluidity in a driven , number non - conserving setup and discuss experimental probes .",
    "section  [ keeling_sec : vort - driv - diss ] gives a brief account of vortices in such open systems .",
    "conclusions and challenges for future research are given in section  [ keeling_sec : future - direct - open ] .",
    "bose - einstein condensation for a gas of weakly interacting bosons is a phase transition associated with the appearance of off - diagonal long range order ( odlro )  @xcite .",
    "this means that correlation functions such as @xmath0 remain non - zero even between distant points , @xmath1 .",
    "these correlations indicate the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the @xmath2 phase of the condensate wavefunction , i.e. writing @xmath3 , odlro corresponds to the phase @xmath4 being correlated at distant points .",
    "in such a symmetry broken phase there is a `` phase stiffness '' , i.e. there is an energy cost , @xmath5 = ( k_s/2 ) \\int d^2{\\mathbf{r } } ( \\nabla \\theta)^2 $ ] for phase twists of the condensate .    a gedanken experiment to determine this phase stiffness is to measure the change of energy as one imposes a phase twist between the boundaries of the system .",
    "alternatively , since phase gradients correspond to currents , a more practical way to measure the phase stiffness is to apply a force that tries to drive a current , and observe the condensate s response .",
    "the behaviour of a condensate in a rotating container illustrates the role of the phase stiffness very clearly  @xcite .",
    "the condensate can not be made to rotate except by creating quantised vortices , and these cost energy due to the phase stiffness .",
    "thus , for slow rotation , the condensate fails to rotate .",
    "similar behaviour can be seen in a ring trap , where the core of a vortex can be located outside the condensate .",
    "this is the hess - fairbank  @xcite effect , and is a defining property of a superfluid .",
    "i.e. , when a condensate has non - zero phase stiffness , it becomes superfluid , as seen by its reduced response to rotation .",
    "however , superfluidity is not equivalent to bose - einstein condensation ; as discussed below , in two dimensions , bose - einstein condensation and odlro do not exist , yet superfluidity persists .",
    "it is therefore useful to be able to define superfluidity directly without reference to condensation .",
    "this can be done , by defining a superfluid density as the part of the system that fails to respond to slow rotations .",
    "this definition also clarifies another important point : except at zero temperature , a system will have both superfluid and normal components , as thermally excited quasiparticles can respond normally to rotations . to identify the superfluid density we must consider the response function @xmath6 , which relates the current @xmath7 to the force that induces it , @xmath8 : @xmath9 where @xmath10 refer to cartesian components .",
    "the operator @xmath11 appearing here is the standard particle current written in momentum space ; @xmath12 we consider systems in which this current is conserved , i.e. @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the particle density .",
    "according to noether s theorem , current conservation corresponds to the existence of a @xmath2 phase symmetry in the hamiltonian  this is the same symmetry which is spontaneously broken on bose - einstein condensation .",
    "considering static ( i.e. @xmath15 ) long - wavelength ( i.e. @xmath16 ) currents , the most general response function possible for an isotropic system is : @xmath17 these terms @xmath18 describe the response to longitudinal and transverse forces , i.e. @xmath19 , which occurs for a potential force , and @xmath20 , which occurs for rotational or magnetic forces .",
    "current conservation can be shown to mean that @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the single particle green s function , so that indeed @xmath23 is related to the total particle number .",
    "the transverse part of @xmath24 describes the response to rotations ; therefore superfluidity corresponds to a reduction of @xmath25 . in a non - superfluid ,",
    "current is parallel to force , which means @xmath26 .",
    "the superfluid fraction of a system is therefore given by @xmath27 , and the normal fraction by @xmath28 .",
    "the above definition of superfluidity depends on the _ equilibrium _ effect that a system in true thermal equilibrium has a reduced response to rotational forces .",
    "this effect is conceptually distinct from the _ metastable _ persistent flow that can also be seen in a non - simply connected ( e.g. annular ) geometry  @xcite .",
    "metastable persistent flow occurs if one first sets the fluid in motion by rotating the container while above the critical temperature , and then cools the fluid until it becomes superfluid .",
    "if the container then stops rotating the fluid remains in motion , as the lifetime for the current to decay is exponentially large .",
    "it is also important to note that the superfluid density defined above is a static property of the system ; if excited dynamically , it is always possible to create excitations out of the condensate . because the elementary spectrum of an interacting bose gas has a linearly dispersing bogoliubov sound mode , this sound velocity @xmath29 acts as a critical velocity  @xcite : for a defect moving at a lower velocity , no excitations can be created beyond the condensed component .",
    "however , at non - zero temperatures , thermally excited quasi - particles can respond to flow at any velocity , and a normal component will occur , as discussed above . in equilibrium",
    "there is a fundamental connection between the existence of a non - zero sound velocity and the presence of a non - zero superfluid fraction : as discussed by  @xcite , the finite frequency response function @xmath6 has the same poles as the single particle green s function , and so the finite frequency generalisation of the superfluid part of eq .",
    "( [ keeling_eq:2 ] ) is @xmath30 .",
    "the fact that this is finite at @xmath31 is thus connected to the form of the dispersion and the existence of a non - zero sound velocity .      in two dimensions , the distinction between superfluidity and bec becomes even more important , since an homogeneous two dimensional system is unable to show true long - range order due to the mermin - wagner theorem  @xcite .",
    "this can be seen by considering the correlation function @xmath32 \\rangle$ ] .",
    "even for a system with a non - zero phase stiffness , @xmath5 = ( k_s/2 ) \\int d^2{\\mathbf{r } } ( \\nabla \\theta)^2 $ ] , the vanishing energy cost of long wavelength phase twists leads to a thermal expectation which , at long distances , takes the form @xmath33 which vanishes algebraically as @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , there is no odlro , and so no single mode is macroscopically occupied ; i.e. , there is no bec .",
    "nonetheless , superfluidity can survive , because the phase stiffness @xmath35 implies a resistance to rotation of the low energy modes of the condensate .",
    "in fact , either by directly comparing the calculation of phase stiffness and superfluid density  @xcite , or by calculating the current - current response function from the parametrisation and energy functional above  @xcite , one finds that the phase stiffness ( and thus the power law decay ) is directly related to the superfluid stiffness : specifically , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the quasiparticle mass .",
    "in addition to the distinct nature of the low temperature phase in two dimensions , the transition to this phase is also unusual .",
    "as noted above , a superfluid can be made to rotate by creating quantised vortices , in which the phase winds by @xmath38 around a point , and the density of the condensate vanishes at that point . as discussed by kosterlitz and thouless  @xcite and berezhinskii  @xcite ,",
    "the transition out of the superfluid phase occurs through the proliferation of these vortices .",
    "the phase boundary can be found by a renormalisation group approach  @xcite , which predicts that if @xmath39 , vortices proliferate and correlations decay exponentially , whereas for @xmath40 , vortices are irrelevant at large scales and correlations decay algebraically . as a result , the exponent for the algebraic decay , eq .",
    "( [ keeling_eq:3 ] ) takes the universal value @xmath41 at the phase boundary , and the superfluid density undergoes a universal jump  @xcite .",
    "a driven dissipative system is by definition one that is coupled to more than one environment , or is driven by a time dependent pumping field .",
    "one can therefore no longer apply equilibrium concepts , such as minimising free energy , or the fluctuation - dissipation theorem . for",
    "a given system , such as a weakly interacting dilute bose gas , there are many different types of driving and dissipation .",
    "some of these conserve particle number ; others do not . in this chapter we consider the latter case , motivated by systems such as microcavity polaritons ( for a review see  @xcite and chapters xx of this book ) .",
    "microcavity polaritons are superpositions of excitons and photons , and the photon part can leak out through the mirrors . to reach a steady state this loss",
    "must be replenished by a compensating pump .",
    "several models can be written to describe this , with varying descriptions of the reservoir that replenishes the condensate  @xcite .",
    "all such models lead to the same essential differences between the equilibrium and driven dissipative cases .",
    "we consider the model starting from the weakly interacting dilute bose gas , @xmath42 and consider loss terms described by the quantum master equation @xmath43    + \\int d^dr \\left (      \\frac{\\kappa}{2 } \\mathcal{l}[\\hat \\psi(r),\\rho ]      +      \\frac{\\gamma}{2 } \\mathcal{l}[\\hat \\psi^\\dagger(r),\\rho ]      +      \\frac{\\gamma}{4 } \\mathcal{l}[\\hat \\psi^2(r),\\rho ]    \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath44 = 2 \\hat{x } \\rho \\hat{x}^\\dagger - [ \\hat{x}^\\dagger \\hat{x } , \\rho]_+$ ] is the usual lindblad operator .",
    "the terms in eq .",
    "describe single particle loss , single particle incoherent pump , and two - particle losses at rates @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , respectively .      the role of the dissipative terms in eq .",
    "( [ keeling_eq:5 ] ) can be seen by considering the corresponding mean - field equation of motion , found by replacing @xmath47 , and decoupling all correlators .",
    "this gives : @xmath48 \\varphi,\\ ] ] which is a modified gross ",

    "the nonlinear term with coefficient @xmath46 describes gain saturation , or feedback between the condensate and the reservoir , which prevents the particle density from diverging . for small fluctuations around the steady state , @xmath49",
    ", one finds the fluctuations have a complex spectrum @xmath50 of the form : @xmath51 the quantity @xmath52 reduces to the equilibrium bogoliubov excitation spectrum in the limit @xmath53 . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ keeling_sec : superfl - phase - coher ] , @xmath54 has a linear dispersion , @xmath55 at low momentum , where @xmath56 . in contrast",
    ", @xmath50 is diffusive at low momentum , @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",
    "this modified dispersion would appear to mean that the critical velocity vanishes .",
    "nonetheless , signatures of a non - vanishing critical velocity can survive in static correlation functions  albeit washed out by dissipation . to see this",
    "one may calculate theoretically the drag force on a defect immersed in a steady flow pattern around the defect potential @xmath59 .",
    "the static drag force on the defect is given by  @xcite @xmath60 .",
    "for a perfect superfluid below the critical velocity , the flow pattern is symmetric , so that the effects of pressure ahead of and behind the defect cancel : i.e. `` dalembert s paradox '' occurs , that an irrotational flow produces no drag .",
    "the gpe , with @xmath61 describes such a perfect superfluid , and would thus normally predict zero drag , however , if one calculates the drag using the complex gpe given above , a finite drag force exists at all velocities  @xcite",
    ". there does however remain a marked threshold at @xmath62 above which the drag increases more rapidly with velocity .",
    "this behaviour is similar to an equilibrium superfluid at finite temperature , however calculating the finite temperature drag for an equilibrium superfluid requires including fluctuations beyond the mean - field theory .",
    "the modified dispersion also has effects on the linear - response calculation of phase correlations  @xcite , however as discussed below , a more dramatic change arises because a linearised theory becomes inadequate in calculating correlations of the driven dissipative bose gas in two dimensions .      in order to calculate correlations and response functions ,",
    "the mean - field description is not sufficient .",
    "various methods for dealing with driven dissipative systems such as eq .",

    "remarkably , this equation can be upgraded to a full description of the problem by means of the martin - siggia - rose construction  @xcite .",
    "this shows that the functional integral eq .   in the semiclassical limit",

    "the action   in the semiclassical limit or the dsgpe allow us to state precisely the sense in which the driven dissipative system is a genuinely non - equilibrium situation .",

    "note , however , that the value of @xmath92 is adjustable by a gauge transformation @xmath93 such that @xmath94 . it can be shown  @xcite that if the system is to relax to thermodynamic equilibrium ( if the steady state of eq .",
    "( [ keeling_eq:12 ] ) is to be described by a gibbs distribution ) , then the coherent and dissipative hamiltonians must be proportional to each other ; that is , @xmath95 where @xmath96 is a constant .",
    "this requirement is in general not satisfied for a driven dissipative system because the microscopic origins of reversible and irreversible dynamics are independent .",
    "for example , in the microscopic description of eq .",
    "the rates can be tuned independently from the hamiltonian parameters , as they have completely different physical origins .",
    "we have thus far made two important observations pertaining to a driven condensate .",
    "one is that , in spite of particle number non - conservation , the equations of motion describing an incoherently driven condensate enjoy a @xmath2 phase symmetry .",
    "the second observation is that the steady state can not be in general described by an equilibrium ensemble .",
    "so , while a condensation transition involving spontaneous symmetry breaking is possible , the nature of the transition and the conditions under - which such a condensate would be indeed a stable fixed point of the dynamics may be different from the equilibrium case .",
    "the question concerning the nature of the condensation transition in three dimensional driven condensates was addressed in refs .",
    "@xcite . one main result of this analysis was that the equilibrium symmetry , @xmath97 is emergent in the low frequency limit even though it is not present microscopically .",
    "hence the _ correlation _ functions correspond to an effective equilibrium description with a well defined emergent temperature .",
    "nevertheless , the drive conditions affect the long wavelength dynamical _ response _ functions , guaranteed by the existence of a new and independent critical exponent .    in two dimensions ,",
    "as we will show next , the long wavelength behaviour is changed much more dramatically : in isotropic systems , the slow algebraic decay of correlation functions that occurs in equilibrium is replaced by far faster exponential or stretched exponential decay . only for sufficiently anisotropic systems",
    "can the quasi - long - ranged algebraic decay found in equilibrium be recovered .      as discussed in sec .",
    "[ keeling_sec : superfl - phase - coher ] , the mermin - wagner theorem states that a homogeneous equilibrium system with a continuous symmetry can not show long - range order that breaks that continuous symmetry in two or fewer dimensions .",
    "rather , in two dimensions , long - wavelength phase fluctuations lead to algebraic decay of order parameter correlations .",
    "naturally the question arises whether this statement remains true out of equilibrium .",
    "the answer to this question proves to depend on both dimensionality , and anisotropy . in three dimensions , the deviation from effective equilibrium , which is encoded in the difference between the ratios @xmath98 and @xmath99 ( cf .",

    "there is , however , a loophole : a spatially _ anisotropic _ system can support an algebraically ordered phase .",

    "is rather involved , two simple conclusions can be drawn without reference to these details . the most important conclusion stemming from the above formalism is that ( as long as the linearised theory is valid ) , a superfluid fraction will exist , due to the form of the first five diagrams shown in fig .",

    "this feature ( along with the structure of the diagrams ) ensures a superfluid contribution to the response function .",
    "the second important conclusion comes from the contribution of the last diagram , giving the normal fraction .",
    "this gives an expression : @xmath215,\\ ] ] which can be evaluated , and shown not to vanish unless the loss terms vanish .",
    "this has a simple physical interpretation : the noise associated with pumping and dissipation leads to the excitation of quasiparticles , and thus the creation of a normal fraction in all cases .",
    "as emphasised in the preceding sections , the superfluid density calculated above is a measure of the difference in how a system responds to transverse ( rotational ) vs longitudinal forces . as such , measurement of this superfluid response requires measuring the response to a rotational perturbation of some kind . for superfluid helium ,",
    "the classic experiment is that of andronikashvilli , using a torsional oscillator formed of parallel discs , and studying the changing inertia of the fluid as the temperature varies .",
    "for polaritons , several issues arise : the particles are quasiparticles , which do not strongly couple to a rotating inertial frame , they live inside a semiconductor , and so applying a stirring force is challenging , and their rotation does not provide any measurable contribution to the mechanical angular momentum .",
    "what is therefore required is a way to engineer an effective rotating frame _ as seen by the polaritons _ , and to measure the response of the polaritons to this .    engineering a rotating frame for polaritons",
    "can be achieved in the same spirit as proposed for cold atoms  @xcite , namely manufacturing a real space berry curvature arising from spatially varying spin structure of polariton eigenstates .",
    "the essence of such a synthetic rotation is to use the two - component spinor structure of the polariton to construct a spatially varying ground state @xmath216 such that the berry connection @xmath217 takes the form @xmath218 , corresponding to a synthetic rotating frame .",
    "such a configuration arises from the ground state of the spin hamiltonian @xmath219 $ ] , where @xmath220 are in - plane polar coordinates , and @xmath221 are pauli matrices for the spinor basis .",
    "the term @xmath222 corresponds to a zeeman splitting induced by an external field .",
    "the other term requires either an induced strain , a strong radial magnetic field ( i.e. diverging in the plane of the polariton system ) .",
    "this leads to an angular velocity peaking at @xmath223 around @xmath224 .",
    "measuring the response to such a field is in principle possible in a variety of ways , since an advantage of the polariton system is the ability to directly probe polariton correlation functions in both real and momentum space . in particular , it is in principle possible to measure correlations such as @xmath225 as a function of @xmath226 by taking the interference between two momentum - space images of the condensate , displaced in real space , with a variable phase delay , i.e. calculating @xmath227 , and mapping the fringe visibility as one varies @xmath228 .",
    "real space displaced fringe visibility maps are routinely measured , see e.g.  @xcite ; the equivalent momentum space tomography would allow access to the current induced by a given force , and thus reconstruction of the response function @xmath229 .",
    "existing experiments probing aspects of superfluidity in polaritons are still far from this limit .",
    "indeed what has been observed thus far is suppression of drag , rather than the difference between transverse and longitudinal response .",
    "in addition , such experiments to date have included measurements of the suppression of scattering from defects , as a function of velocity and intensity of a coherently driven condensate  @xcite .      as discussed in section  [ keeling_sec : superfl - phase - coher ]",
    ", the appearance of quantised vortices demonstrates the existence of short range coherence in a system , and is closely related to metastable persistent flow in a non - simply - connected geometry .",
    "we review here how these features are modified in a dissipative condensate .",
    "it is notable that the structure of vortices changes in the presence of drive and dissipation .",
    "because the dissipation depends on density , the `` continuity '' equation derived from eq .",
    "( [ keeling_eq:5 ] ) takes the form : @xmath230 this has the consequence that near the core of a vortex , where density is depleted , there is net gain , and so there must be a current with non - vanishing divergence .",
    "given that current can be rewritten as @xmath231 $ ] , this diverging current implies that vortices in a driven dissipative system must have a spiral structure , with radial as well as angular variation of phase .",
    "such spiral vortices have been discussed in the context of nonlinear optics  @xcite .",
    "the existence of a spiral structure can modify the force between a pair of vortices , and so may modify the nature of the vortex binding / unbinding at the kt transition .",
    "this provides a further complication  in addition to that provided by the strong nonlinearity of the kpz equation  in understanding the kt transition in a driven dissipative system .",
    "there can also be cases in which combinations of spatial variation of drive , dissipation , and potential trapping destabilise the vortex free configuration , and instead stabilise configurations such as vortex lattices  @xcite .",
    "however , understanding whether such configurations occur in practice requires analysis of the normal state , going beyond the scope of the complex gpe  @xcite .    because of the photon component of a polariton condensate , it is also possible to directly imprint vortices on the condensate , by using a coherent gauss - laguerre beam .",
    "calculations using stochastic classical field methods have shown  @xcite how such pulses can create metastable vortex states in both simply and non - simply - connected geometries .",
    "the additional noise associated with pumping and decay means that the timescale for a vortex to move out of such a condensate can be relatively short : rather than quantum tunnelling , it can diffuse across a small annulus , driven by noise from the pump and decay terms .",
    "vortices have been clearly observed in polariton condensates  @xcite , however since most images of polariton condensates require long integration times , vortices can only be seen if they are either stationary ( pinned on disorder ) , or if they move along a repeatable path  @xcite ( so that averages over many realisations recover the same trajectory ) . as such , indirect methods of imaging vortices",
    "may be necessary , such as interference measurements with angular offsets  @xcite , or , for vortex lattices , energy resolved and interference images  @xcite .",
    "the most profound open question is how the kpz roughening interacts with the fact that phase is a compact variable and can thus support topological defects .",
    "as discussed previously two scenarios seem possible",
    ". it may be that as the kpz equation flows to strong nonlinearity , the destruction of algebraic order also destroys any resistance to vortex proliferation . in this case , correlations are always exponential , there is no ordered phase , no superfluidity , and no phase transition . in this scenario ,",
    "all experiments on polariton condensates would be finite size effects , although potentially exceptionally large system sizes needed before the `` true '' behaviour becomes visible .",
    "the other possible scenario is that the strong nonlinearity is compatible with vortex binding . in this case",
    ", there would be a phase transition between a high temperature phase showing exponential decay of correlations , and a low temperature phase with stretched exponential decay .",
    "if this scenario holds then despite the absence of algebraic order , there can be a non - zero superfluid stiffness  @xcite .",
    "if such a phase transition exists , it could potentially require a new universality class , distinct from the equilibrium kt universality class .    while the above questions concern the fundamental physics of the thermodynamic limit , a second set of questions concern the signatures of this behaviour visible in finite experimental systems .",
    "physical  @xcite and numerical  @xcite experiments have observed power law correlations , but with surprising values of the power law exponent ; understanding the physical origin of this behaviour may help understand the nature of the driven dissipative system .",
    "finally , experiments directly probing the superfluid response function  i.e. measuring the superfluid fraction  of a driven dissipative condensate have yet to be realised . even in the context of cold atom systems , direct measurements of the superfluid fraction",
    "remain challenging  @xcite .",
