    "the current cosmological concordance model that is well supported by the latest microwave background and supernova type ia observations , includes both a large repulsive cosmological term and a cold dark matter ( cdm ) component .",
    "the nature and origin of these components is yet unknown , leaving room for novel theoretical explanations and new cosmological scenarios . in the standard cosmological scenario the cosmological term , @xmath0 ,",
    "is a true constant but , as is already suggested by the plethora of papers devoted to the subject , this need not to be the case . in addition , the difficulty of explaining the existence and value of the cosmological constant from fundamental physics , leaves plenty of room and motivation for phenomenological proposals .    instead of having a universe with a non - zero @xmath0 , one can study cosmological models that , within the observational boundaries , imitate the evolution of a universe with a cosmological constant and cold dark matter , the model .",
    "such models can have be the result of a modified friedmann equation or contain a new type of matter with positive energy density and negative pressure . among these models are the large class of quintessence models ( see e.g. @xcite ) , the brane inspired models @xcite , cardassian models @xcite and recently the chaplygin gas models @xcite .    the general chaplygin gas ( gcg ) models are characterized by a perfect fluid with a non - standard equation of state p_g=-_g^ where @xmath1 is a positive ( dimensionfull ) constant .",
    "it is useful to define a dimensionless constant , @xmath2 ( also often denoted as @xmath3 ) , by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the present day density of the cgg .",
    "the original chaplygin gas model @xcite corresponds to the choice @xmath6 .",
    "such an equation of state can be the result of a scalar field with a non - standard kinetic term , the string theory motivated tachyon field @xcite .",
    "the generalization of the original chaplygin gas , to cases where @xmath7 , was done in @xcite . since the original chaplygin gas scenario is reached as a special case of the general chaplygin gas , we will concentrate on the latter .",
    "the cosmological behavior of the gcg is between a dark matter and a cosmological constant . at large densities",
    ", it behaves as pressureless dust where as at small densities , presently , it acts as a cosmological constant . as such , one can hope to have a unified dark matter candidate , one that can play both the role of cold dark matter and of the cosmological constant @xcite . taking a more conservative view",
    ", one can also consider a universe with both significant cdm and gcg components .",
    "the different cosmological models that include a ( generalized ) chaplygin gas component can then be divided into two classes : models with and without a significant cdm component .",
    "models that do not include a specific cdm component are often called unified dark matter ( cdm ) models .",
    "the unified dark matter models with a ( generalized ) chaplygin gas have been studied in various works in view of cosmological observations .",
    "cosmological perturbations of the gcg - fluid have been considered in @xcite,@xcite-@xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was claimed that the matter power spectrum strongly constrains the parameter space of unified dark matter models , essentially ruling them out .",
    "this result does not include the effect of the baryons , however , and is hence questionable@xcite .",
    "also , as it was pointed out in @xcite , the restriction due to the matter power spectrum may be avoided by allowing for entropy perturbations . to complicate the matter further , in @xcite",
    "it was shown that one must be careful in using linear theory to study the perturbations as linear theory may break down sooner than expected .",
    "other observational measures of universes with a gcg - component include the snia constraints @xcite , constraints coming from the cmb @xcite and other astrophysical data @xcite .",
    "a significant fraction of the work so far has concentrated on the unified dark matter proposal . in this letter",
    "we concentrate on the more general case where there is in addition to the gcg - component , a significant cold dark matter fraction .",
    "the gcg plays the role of dark energy , from this point of view this model can be seen as a quintessence model with a dynamical equation of state .",
    "gcg as dark energy has been studied in recent works @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in @xcite it was found by using snia data that a universe dominated with a chaplygin gas was favored over a mixed model . on the other hand , in @xcite",
    "it was concluded that a model is preferred .",
    "also in @xcite , using wmap data it was showed that a cdm model is disfavored and a mixed model , with a -like behavior , was preferred .",
    "the current bounds on the parameters are varied , depending on the type observational data .",
    "using globular clusters to determine the age of the universe , in @xcite it was found that @xmath8 ( @xmath6 ) , where as for the lensing statistics the bounds are somewhat looser @xmath9 . using the wmap data , in @xcite",
    "the parameter bounds were found to be @xmath10 and the original chaplygin gas is ruled out . in @xcite ,",
    "x - rays from galaxy clusters , hst data and snia data were used to obtain @xmath11 . using only snia data ,",
    "it was found in @xcite for the original cg - model that @xmath12 .    in this work",
    "we study the mixed scenario , with cdm and gcg , from the point of view of large structure growth .",
    "we take a quintessence - like approach to the chaplygin gas , only the cdm component is assumed to collapse and form structures . the chaplygin gas acts only as dark energy and is visible , from the point of structure growth , only through the friedmann equation .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the unified dark matter scenario where the cg is also responsible for the growth of structures .",
    "the scenario considered here may be seen as a universe dominated by a scalar field with a non - standard kinetic term arising from string theory .",
    "similar considerations for quintessence scenarios have been presented in @xcite , where large scale structure is used to test different quintessence models .    by studying large scale structure growth from the point of view of gravitational collapse",
    "we probe the significance of the gcg dark energy component throughout the epoch during which large scale structures grow .",
    "the linear and non - linear growth can be related to observations and hence lead to observational constraints like galaxy number counts ( see @xcite ) .",

    "( [ gcggrow ] ) we see that for @xmath70 , linear growth will be suppressed relative to the @xmath71 scenario , and to a universe which follows the eds - solution until late times .",
    "we can see in fig .",
    "[ linfig ] that any small deviations of the gcg parameters from the values ( @xmath6 and @xmath46 ) produced substantial suppression of linear growth .",
    "for example , even the case @xmath72 produces a much higher amplitude of fluctuations at decoupling ( @xmath73 ) than the cosmology ( when normalized at @xmath60 ) .",
    "such differences in normalization are hard to reconcile with our current understanding of cmb anisotropies ( see eg @xcite ) . the final numbers dependent on the adopted model for cmb transfer function and matter content ,",
    "but it is already apparent that we will need to tune the gcg parameters very close to the model . as an independent test we have also presented the predictions of the gcg model for the isw effect ,",
    "see fig.[fdotfig ] and the skewness of the density field , see eq.([s3new ] ) .",
    "again , the isw effect is much larger even for @xmath72 compared to a universe .",
    "it should be stressed that in the scenario considered here , the gcg only acts through the background evolution and does not undergo gravitational collapse .",
    "hence , these parameter constraints do not apply to the unified dark matter models with a gcg component .",
    "observations seem to favor values of the gcg parameter which makes it equivalent in practice to a cosmological constant .",
    "we conclude therefore that using the gcg as a form of dark energy does not seem to provide any apparent advantage over the more simple model , which has fewer parameters .",
    "it is nevertheless clear that future observations will be able to provide tighter constraints on the quantities we have studied here . if the model fails to match such observations , the gcg models could be an useful alternative to consider .",
