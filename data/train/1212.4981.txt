    "* calibration of energy barrier :  * to calibrate the energy barrier we followed a procedure similar to that used previously for continuous electron sources  @xcite . in brief",
    ", we applied a source bias @xmath56 behind one of the electron pump gates , which is set to a voltage similar to that used in pump operation .",
    "the pump , side and collector terminals are connected together via ammeters , as in the single electron experiment .",
    "we then increase @xmath56 until this marginally exceeds the barrier threshold and a continuous current of hot electrons flows into the central channel .",
    "we assume that the electrons are essentially emitted with an energy corresponding to the source drain bias .",
    "we then scan the energy detector barrier which , as in the single electron case , serves to block or permit the electron current into the collector @xmath5 .",
    "such data is shown in fig .",
    "the horizontal dashed line indicates the minimum bias voltage required for current to be driven across the source barrier .",
    "the slight slope is because of a small capacitive coupling to the detector barrier gate .",
    "the tilted line represents the threshold to block the injected hot electrons .",
    "this edge is most sharply defined when the input current is small , near @xmath57  mv boundary , and becomes more broad at larger @xmath58 where the current is larger ( in the white region in the bottom right hand corner the current is out of range of this color scale . by finding the values of @xmath9 and @xmath56 at which the collector current is blocked , we identify that @xmath59 at the energies where we are operating .",
    "the features of our pump data which we ascribe to phonon emission ( corresponding to an interval of @xmath036  mev ) are consistent with this relative calibration . to fix an absolute energy scale we consider that for @xmath60  mv , the blocking threshold is @xmath61  v. near this point we use this as an approximate linear calibration @xmath62 in units of ev .",
    "while this is satisfactory for the energy range of our electron pump emission , deviations from linearity occur at lower energy due to screening effects .",
    "for example , a certain voltage is required before the detector gate depletes the 2deg enough to cut off transport at the fermi energy @xmath63v . for measurements in this range",
    "a different calibration would be required.x      * calculation of inelastic scattering length :  * we estimate the scattering length by assuming that the fraction of pumped electrons @xmath66 in the main step in @xmath5 ( rather than that in the phonon side peaks or any current detected in the side channel ) are those that have not suffered any inelastic scattering in the distance @xmath67 m between source and detector . for @xmath12  t , where the phonon side peaks are weak @xmath68 . assuming a constant scattering rate , giving an exponential scattering length , this gives @xmath69 m .      to calculate the collector current for a certain distribution of electron energy and arrival time we model a time and energy dependent transmission probability , convolved with a 2d gaussian distribution in electron energy and arrival time .",
    "the transmission function is based on a model detector response and consists of a broadened step - like transmission as a function of energy .",
    "@xmath70^{-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the broadening .",
    "the threshold position is controlled by the relative barrier height , @xmath72 , where @xmath28 is determined by the voltages applied to the detector barrier voltage , both continuous and oscillating . the net barrier height",
    "is then given by @xmath73 + v_{\\rm ct}(t)\\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath74 converts the values into potential at the 2deg , rather than gate voltage .",
    "the variable delay @xmath30 is controlled by the programmable delay line .",
    "the fixed ( but unknown ) effective delay @xmath36 is due to differences in cable length and other differences in the signal paths of the two lines . for the calculations this",
    "is set to reproduce the location of the origin of @xmath30 ( this simply shifts the origin ) .",
    "the pick up signal @xmath75 originates in cross talk from the pump ( see below ) .",
    "the average current for these conditions was calculated by sampling @xmath76 with a normalised gaussian kernel @xmath77 numerically on a finite energy and time mesh indexed by @xmath78,giving @xmath79 as we are modeling data where the pump source parameters are fixed , the peak energy , @xmath23 , and time @xmath39 are fixed , along with the widths of the distribution @xmath80 and @xmath81 . the transmission probability is controlled via the detector parameters , @xmath9 , @xmath30 and @xmath32 .",
    "experimental values of the energy threshold @xmath82  v and modulation up to @xmath83  v are used ( the latter can be directly measured e.g. from fig . 2c ) .",
    "the baseline level of broadening due to the finite electron energy distribution and the barrier function ( these individual contributions are difficult to separate ) is @xmath84  mv with a static barrier .",
    "peaks in additional broadening occur when the detector changes height most rapidly , in either direction , but size of the effect will be asymmetric , as observed experimentally , in the presence of any other time dependent signals that partly cancel or reinforce this . from the experimental data we find that @xmath85mv / ns at @xmath86 would explain the mismatch , and allow the estimation of the time width of @xmath87ps as in the main text .",
    "we have detected a clear cross - talk signal from the pump in separate experiments , namely measuring the detector conductance while modulating the pump barrier ( with the electron pump configured to a non - pumping regime ) . the value of @xmath9 required to block conduction at the fermi energy shifts to more negative voltage due to a reduced barrier height , induced due to the coupling of the pump barrier to the detector gate and the surrounding 2deg .",
    "this is almost identical to the shifting up and down of the single - electron threshold ( see fig .",
    "1b ) and is visible in the shape of the off - scale dc current in fig .",
    "2c and fig . 3b .",
    "* contributions to line - broadening :  * in addition to the contribution from the finite electron arrival time distribution , we identify and quantify several other processes which could potentially give a broadening of the electronic distribution . _",
    "quantum broadening : _",
    "firstly , the minimum emission broadening is dictated by the finite coupling energy during electron emission , corresponding to an energy spread of @xmath88mev for a 100  ps emission window .",
    "_ changes in pump energy level during emission : _ previous calculations @xcite indicate that the energy level in the dot is not strictly constant during the pumping process , potentially leading to a smearing of the energy output",
    ". this would not have any particular dependence on @xmath30 , but would give an approximately constant contribution to the broadening",
    ". we can estimate the contribution from the size of the rf voltage applied to the primary pumping gate , which is by far the fastest changing scale in the problem .",
    "the power applied to this gate corresponds to a voltage excursion of approximately @xmath89 around the constant value @xmath90  v. the maximum variation in the voltage applied to this gate is then @xmath91  v / s . to estimate an energy distribution we have to estimate likely changes in dot energy from this change in gate voltage considering several factors",
    "firstly , the actual barrier potential will be smaller by a factor similar to that found in the detector calibration described above .",
    "secondly , this barrier height only changes the dot energy level indirectly ; this is not a direct ` plunger ' gate .",
    "this is particularly true as the barrier becomes very tall near the point of particle ejection .",
    "finally , the entrance barrier potential is near its most negative value when electrons are emitted , so the rate of change of this barrier height is slowed near the moment of particle ejection .",
    "we estimate that these factors give an energy spread attributable to the pump modulation of @xmath92  mv , much smaller than the values seen experimentally .",
    "_ back action of the energy barrier on the pump : _ we have found that when strongly modulating the detector barrier this has a small but detectable effect on the operating point of the electron pump .",
    "the main observation is that the boundaries of the pump current plateaux as a function of @xmath8 move by up to @xmath93  mv , varying sinusoidally as the detector modulation delay @xmath36 is varied .",
    "this is a small shift compared to the width of the plateaux ( @xmath030 - 40  mv ) , and is only visible when the detector barrier is being modulated most strongly . using the observed linear relationship between the peak position in @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( fig .",
    "1c ) this can be translated into a variation in emission energy of up to @xmath94  mev for the largest detector modulations that we have applied .",
    "this effect on the source energy is essentially disguised by the much bigger effect ( 15 times bigger ) that modulation has on the detector threshold ( fig .",
    "we can estimate how much the time dependence of this effect might give an apparent energy broadening . at the value of @xmath30 that would create the fastest perturbation to the emission energy , and using our arrival time distribution time as an upper limit on the emission time",
    ", we expect a line broadening of 0.6  mv .",
    "this is about ten times smaller than the overall values seen in fig .",
    "2d , but might plausibly distort certain features of the data when operating at high modulation , for instance , introducing a weak ( @xmath010% ) sinusoidal modulation to the broadening , on top of the double peak structure . while the overall structure of the data are dominated by the time broadening effect , this introduces an uncertainty of @xmath95 into the exact value of the arrival time distribution .",
    "this is comparable with other contributions , like the detailed choice of the shape of the barrier function and assumptions about the arrival time distribution ."

    "<S> we conclude that the time of arrival distribution width is @xmath51  ps , less than 1% of the cycle time . </S>",
    "<S> this short distribution is due to a combination of the fast emission allowed by the strong variations in barrier height in our single - electron source and near - linear dispersion of landau levels at high energy . </S>",
    "<S> in other cases , the emission distribution is likely to be even smaller than this , for example at higher operation frequencies the ejection process is necessarily faster and hence a shorter arrival time distribution is expected  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this time - domain technique , which is effectively high bandwidth charge detection , can be used to measure these electron emission times or used to track the dispersion of single electron wavepackets over long distances .    </S>",
    "<S> the narrow emission energy range and short wavepacket time also allow us to explore new techniques for controlling electron beams consisting of multiple electrons . in our pump , </S>",

    "<S> the other ( labelled @xmath24 ) abruptly ends when @xmath8 crosses the boundary to one - electron pumping . </S>",
    "<S> this second peak corresponds to the emission of one of the two electrons captured by the dot , leaving the other electron ( @xmath23 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> using our modulated barrier technique we have found that this splitting of the energy spectrum is due to both differences in emission energy , and a relative delay in arrival of the two electrons at the detector . </S>",
    "<S> this means that for @xmath9 values between these peaks one of the emitted electrons crosses the detector and the other is reflected into the side channel .    under strong modulation of the detector barrier , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath23 and @xmath24 thresholds oscillate with @xmath30 , as in the one - electron case ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the presence of a shift on the @xmath54 axis of  350  ps indicates that the electrons do not actually arrive at the detector at the same time , and hence encounter different barrier heights . </S>",
    "<S> the splitting in the measured spectrum does not depend solely on the emission energy , but also on delays in electron arrival . </S>",
    "<S> figure  3(c ) shows a model of the time and energy distribution of the two incoming electrons to illustrate this effect .    </S>",
    "<S> the order in which the electrons are blocked as the barrier is raised can be reversed depending on the time dependence of the barrier height . </S>",
    "<S> this is the origin of the crossing of the two threshold lines ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) ) . in this regime ( @xmath55  ns ) @xmath15 and @xmath18 ( see fig </S>",
    "<S> .  </S>",

    "<S> 3(d ) ) appears ` flipped ' with respect to that in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) because the allocation of the first / second electron to collector / side channel has been reversed , in essence directing electrons according to order of arrival . </S>",
    "<S> this gives us a means of splitting a two - electron beam into two output channels in any combination we choose , with a known time delay between emission . </S>",
    "<S> this may be a useful technique for dividing electrons that are initially in a quantum superposition in the pump into two separate arms of a quantum device . </S>",
    "<S> the timing information is also critical for synchronising electron arrival , for instance in an electronic form of a hong ou mandel interferometer  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we have presented a way of controlling / conditioning single - electron wavepackets emission both in time and energy domains , and characterising their ballistic transport through a channel in the solid state . </S>",
    "<S> information that can be gleaned from this technique is not only the energy spectrum and scattering rate of the emitted electrons , but detailed time domain information that would be very difficult to obtain any other way . </S>",
    "<S> the ability to trap multiple electrons in a single confined system , then subsequently re - emit these on demand into multiple controlled output channels represents a possible new resource for the creation of experimental probes of entanglement in electronic systems .    </S>",
    "<S> we would like to acknowledge useful conversations with stefan ludwig and heung - sun sim . </S>",
