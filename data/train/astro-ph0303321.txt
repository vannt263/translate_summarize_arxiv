    "the discovery of a tight relation between the masses of the stellar bulges of galaxies and the masses of their central black holes @xcite has reemphasized the importance of high redshift active galactic nuclei ( agns ) as probes of galaxy formation .",
    "they are therefore the target of many studies of starformation in their host galaxies .",
    "since a large proportion of the optical and uv emission from a starburst is absorbed and reprocessed by dust to restframe far - ir wavelengths , a good way to investigate the roles of dust and star formation in these distant galaxies is to measure their continuum emission .",
    "another advantage of observing at those wavelengths is that dimming due to cosmological distance is compensated for as the peak in the dust emission is redshifted into the observed passband ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* )    the formation of massive elliptical galaxies may be best studied by tracing the evolution of powerful radio galaxies .",
    "they require the presence of an actively - accreting super massive black hole ( @xmath1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , are very extended and luminous at many wavelenghts allowing detailed studies , and their selection at radio wavelengths is not affected by the presence of dust .",
    "@xcite have conducted a submillimeter survey of 47 radio galaxies over an interval of @xmath2 .",
    "they found a substantial increase in 850  detection rate with redshift and that the average 850  luminosity @xmath3 rises at a rate @xmath4 out to @xmath5 . while it is true that a buried agn could be responsible for heating the dust , there are strong indications that starbursts ( sfr @xmath6 ) are the dominating mechanism : ( i ) there is no strong correlation between radio power and submillimeter luminosity @xcite , ( ii ) for all hyperluminous infrared galaxies the starburst outshines the agn at rest - frame wavelengths longwards of 50 @xcite , and ( iii ) the extent ( up to 30kpc ) of the co and dust - emission found in 3 hzrgs@xcite is not readily explained by a central process .    until recently only few hzrgs at @xmath0 were known , hampering statistical studies",
    "however , using radio and near - ir selection we have significantly increased the sample of @xmath0 hzrgs  at keck ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "here we present submillimeter observations of these .",
    "additionally , we have observed an intriguing class of hzrg - candidates for which no spectroscopic redshift could be determined .",
    "one of these candidates had been studied before in detail ( wn  j0305 + 3525 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and was found to be very submillimeter luminous .",
    "we have selected all known hzrgs  with redshifts @xmath0 without prior scuba observations .",
    "we aimed to observe a significant sample of hzrgs  to complement the observations of @xcite and obtain better statistical info at the highest redshifts .",
    "the sample is the result of an ongoing effort by our group and others ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to find distant radio galaxies based on ultra steep radio spectrum ( uss ) and near - ir identification selection criteria .",
    "also 10  hzrg - candidates have been observed that did not show optical emission lines in deep spectroscopic observations at keck .",
    "the observations have been carried out over 4 semesters in 4 years ( august 1999 @xmath7 january 2002 ) with scuba @xcite at the james clerk maxwell telescope .",
    "we observed at 450  and 850  wavelengths in photometry mode .",
    "the optical depth @xmath8 varied between 0.14 and 0.38 with an average value of 0.26 .",
    "the data were reduced following standard procedures outlined in the scuba photometry cookbook .",
    "in the course of our program we observed 23  hzrgs , of which 12 were detected with a signal - to - noise ratio larger than 3 . adding these data to the sample of @xcite increases the number of 3@xmath9-detections at @xmath0 from 5 to 16 .",
    "there was no attempt to correct for a contribution to the submillimeter continuum from the non - thermal radio emission , since most sources were selected using an uss criterion .",
    "moreover , extrapolation from the radio regime to submillimeter wavelengths is very uncertain at best , and is likely to result in an overestimate of the non - thermal flux density due to steepening of the radio spectrum .",
    "for this reason ( and following * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we have chosen to use the `` un - corrected '' values from @xcite .",
    "figure [ dethist ] shows two histograms representing the number of hzrgsthat were observed at each redshift and the number of hzrgs  that were actually detected given a 2@xmath9 or 3@xmath9 detection criterion .",
    "regardless of the actual detection limit used , a marked increase in the fractional detection rate from @xmath10 at @xmath11 to @xmath12 at @xmath13 is apparent , confirming the result found by @xcite .",
    "we have correlated the inferred submillimeter luminosities with radio power to search for signs of significant heating by the agn .",
    "no strong correlation is apparent ( fig .",
    "[ l151d ] ) .",
    "recently , it was found that the size of the radio source and @xmath3 are correlated for a sample of radio - loud qsos at @xmath14 , with smaller ( i.e. younger ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) sources being more luminous @xcite .",
    "this effect was attributed to a possible relation between the jet - triggering event and a short - lived starburst or quasar - heated dust in qsos .",
    "the effect was not found for a matched sample of radio galaxies at @xmath15 .",
    "we have checked whether there is a correlation between @xmath3 and radio source size ( age ) in our larger sample .",
    "figure [ l151d ] shows that they are not strongly correlated .",
    "however , size of the radio source depends not only on age but also on jet - power and enviroment which is hard to correct for in our heterogeneous sample .",
    "therefore we can not exclude that @xmath3 and age of the radio source are correlated .",
    "the ( sub-)millimeter emission of starbursts should be largely indepent of viewing angle .",
    "unification schemes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) therefore suggest that we can combine observations of hzrgs  with those of qsos , allowing us to study the evolution of starformation in their host galaxies over a larger redshift range .",
    "figure [ avgs850 ] shows the average observed millimeter fluxdensity as a function of redshift for mostly radio - quiet qso samples @xcite and hzrgs .",
    "reassuringly , the trends mimic each other and they indicate that the average observed flux density rises to redshifts of @xmath16 after which it declines .      during our search for hzrgs  among uss sources , we found that 33% of the selected canditates were at redshifts @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however we also found that @xmath18 , mostly with a compact radio morphology , do not show clear signs of emission lines and that a significant fraction ( @xmath19 of the entire sample ) does not even show continuum emission .",
    "possible explanations for this may be that ( i ) these are galaxies in the `` redshift desert '' ( @xmath20 ) where only weak emission lines fall in the optical window , ( ii ) they are pulsars , ( iii ) they are extremely obscured agn ( iv ) or at such high redshift ( @xmath21 ) that  is shifted out of the optical passband .",
    "figure [ 0305 ] shows one of these objects , wn  j0305 + 3525 , which was studied in detail @xcite .",
    "it is a strong detection with @xmath22 = @xmath23mjy and @xmath24 = @xmath25 mjy , and appears associated with a number of faint @xmath26mag and @xmath27mag objects .",
    "the radio morphology is compact ( @xmath28 ) , as is typical of the other candidates .",
    "based on circumstantial evidence like the near - ir magnitudes and morphology , the ( sub-)millimeter ratios and compact radio source morphology it was argued that wn  j0305 + 3525 is a highly obscured hzrg  possibly at a redshift @xmath29 in a young stage of its evolution @xcite .",
    "we have detected 3 more of these hzrg - candidates with flux densities of @xmath30mjy resulting in a detection rate of 4 out of 10 , very similar to what is found for the confirmed hzrgs .",
    "this further supports the idea that they may be young , extremely obscured hzrgs .",
    "* submillimeter detection rate appears to be primarily a function of redshift .",
    "if this is interpreted as being due to a change in the intrinsic far - ir luminosity , it would be consistent with a scenario in which the bulk of the stellar population of radio galaxies forms rapidly around redshifts of @xmath31 after which they are more passively evolving .",
    "* a significant fraction ( 10% ) of uss sources may be very obscured radio galaxies .",
    "the obscuration may be related to their young evolutionary stage . *",
    "in contrast to the submillimeter sources , hzrgs  have accurately determined redshifts and host identifications .",
    "even with the advent of sirtf this is not likely to change .",
    "therefore , hzrgsare a key population for studies of galaxy formation in the early universe , allowing detailed follow - up mm - interferometry observations to study their dust and gas content .",
