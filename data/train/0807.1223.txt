    "with a mass of 172.6 gev the top - quark is by far the heaviest elementary fermion in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "its mass is more than 30 times larger than the mass of the next heaviest fermion , the bottom - quark .",
    "the large mass has lead to various speculations whether the top - quark behaves as a normal quark or whether it plays a special role .",
    "in particular , the fact that the top - quark mass is close to the scale of electroweak symmety breaking  or equivalently , that the yukawa coupling to the higgs is very close to one  has motivated different scenarios in which the top - quark drives the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "for a recent overview we refer the interested reader to . in the context of the sm",
    "the top - quark interactions are completely determined through the gauge structure .",
    "the only free parameter appearing in top - quark physics is the top - quark mass . once this parameter is measured all remaining properties are predicted .",
    "an important task for the ongoing tevatron collider and the upcoming lhc is the precise measurement of the top - quark properties . in this context",
    "the production of a top - quark pair togehter with an additional jet is an important reaction .",
    "this becomes already clear from the simple observation that a substantial number of events in the inclusive top - quark sample is accompanied by an additional jet .",
    "depending on the energy of the additional jet the fraction of events with an additional jet can easily be of the order of 1030% . for a more precise understanding of the topology of top - quark events it is thus important to have also an improved understanding of top - quark pair production together with a jet .",
    "recently it has been argued that the inclusive top - quark pair cross section can be measured at the lhc with an experimental uncertainty of about 5% .",
    "the available theoretical predictions at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) togehter with resummation lead to a theoretical uncertainty of more than 10% @xcite .",
    "the dominant uncertainy comes from the residual scale dependence , while the uncertainties due to the parton distribution functions are comparably small . in parts of the full next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo )",
    "were derived from general arguments .",
    "it has been shown that an nnlo calculation will reduce the theoretical uncertainty down to 5% .",
    "apart from the two - loop corrections ( where progress has been made recently @xcite ) one important ingredient in going to nnlo are the one - loop corrections to @xmath0 production .",
    "apart from its significance as signal process it turns out that @xmath1 production is also an important background to various new physics searches .",
    "a prominent example is higgs production via vector - boson fusion .",
    "this reaction represents an important discovery channel for a sm higgs boson in the mass range of 120180  gev . the major background to",
    "this reaction is due to @xmath2 @xcite , again underlining the need for precise theoretical predictions for this process .",
    "it is well known that predictions at leading - order ( lo ) in the coupling constant of qcd are plagued by large uncertainties . in many cases the lo predictions in qcd",
    "give only a rough estimate .",
    "only by including nlo corrections a quantitative reliable prediction can be obtained .",
    "given that the conceptual problems of doing such calculations are solved since quite some time , one might think that doing the required calculations should be a straightforward task .",
    "unfortunately it turns out that this is not the case .",
    "the calculation of qcd corrections for @xmath3 and @xmath4 reactions is still a highly non - trivial task  not speaking about reactions with an even higher multiplicity . in general the problem",
    "can be attributed to the fact that the corrsponding matrix elements are complex functions of many variables so that an analytic treatment is no longer feasible due to the large size of the expressions . a solution to",
    "this problem is to resort to numerical methods .",
    "while in principle fine one is in many cases plagued by numerical instabilities and the long runtime .",
    "in particular , the reduction of one - loop tensor integrals to scalar one - loop integrals is in general difficult to do in a numerically stable way . in that context",
    "the calculation of the one - loop corrections to top - quark pair production with an additional jet is also interesting as a benchmark process for the developement of new methods . in the present article",
    "we will briefly comment on the calculation of the nlo corrections .",
    "in addition we will show results for integrated quantities as well as for differential distributions .",
    "in born approximation the partonic reactions are @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "the last three reactions are related by crossing . in born approximation various well - tested approaches to calculate the required matrix elements exist .",
    "we used recurrence relation  la berends and giele @xcite and a feynman - diagram - based approach . in both cases",
    "four - dimensional helicity methods were employed .",
    "in addition we also used _ madgraph _",
    "@xcite for checking .",
    "we found complete agreement of the different methods .",
    "the explicit lo calculation shows indeed the large scale dependence as expected . without going into details",
    "we just mention that in lo the importance of the individual partonic channels does not follow the pattern known from inclusive top - quark pair production .",
    "while at the tevatron the situation @xmath2 production is similar to the inclusive reaction , that is the total cross section is dominated by the quark  anti - quark channel followed by the gluon - fusion process , the situation at the lhc is different from inclusive production .",
    "the most important channel is gluon fusion , but in contrast to inclusive production the second important channel is the @xmath9-channel .",
    "this is due to the large parton luminosity for this channel and due to a sizeable partonic cross section .",
    "the virtual corrections consist of the one - loop corrections to the lo reactions .",
    "one can classify the corrections into self - energy corrections , vertex corrections , box - type corrections , and pentagon - type corrections where all the external legs are connected to one loop thus forming a pentagon .",
    "the latter are the most complicated ones owing to their complexity and the involved tensor integrals .",
    "the challenging step in this context is the numerically fast and stable reduction of the tensor integrals to scalar one - loop integrals . to ensure the correctness of our results we did two independent calculations of the virtual corrections using as far as possible different methods and also different tools . in one calculation",
    "the virtual corrections are essentially obtained following the procedure described in , where @xmath10 production at hadron colliders was considered .",
    "feynman diagrams and amplitudes have been generated with the _ feynarts _ package @xcite and further processed with in - house _",
    "mathematica _ routines , which automatically create an output in _",
    "fortran_. the ir ( soft and collinear ) singularities are analytically separated from the finite remainder as described in .",
    "the tensor integrals appearing in the pentagon diagrams are directly reduced to box integrals following .",
    "this method does not introduce inverse gram determinants in this step , thereby avoiding notorious numerical instabilities in regions where these determinants become small .",
    "box and lower - point integrals are reduced  la passarino ",
    "veltman @xcite to scalar integrals , which are either calculated analytically or using the results of .",
    "sufficient numerical stability is already achieved in this way .",
    "nevertheless the integral evaluation is currently further refined by employing the more sophisticated methods described in in order to numerically stabilize the tensor integrals in exceptional phase - space regions .    in the second calculation",
    "the evaluation of loop diagrams starts with the generation of diagrams and amplitudes via _ qgraf _",
    "@xcite , which are then further manipulated with _ form _",
    "@xcite and automatically translated into _",
    "c++ _ code .",
    "the reduction of the 5-point tensor integrals to scalar integrals is performed with an extension of the method described in . in this procedure",
    "also inverse gram determinants of four four - momenta are avoided .",
    "the lower - point tensor integrals are reduced using an independent implementation of the passarino ",
    "veltman procedure .",
    "the ir - finite scalar integrals are evaluated using the _",
    "package @xcite .",
    "the matrix elements for the real corrections are given by @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the various partonic processes are obtained from these matrix elements by all possible crossings of light particles into the initial state .",
    "the evaluation of the real - emission amplitudes is again performed in two independent ways .",
    "both evaluations employ the dipole subtraction formalism @xcite for the extraction of ir singularities and for their combination with the virtual corrections",
    ".    one calculation of the real corrections results from a fully automated calculation based on helicity amplitudes , as described in .",
    "individual helicity amplitudes are computed with the help of berends ",
    "giele recurrence relations @xcite . the evaluation of color factors and the generation of subtraction terms is automated .",
    "for the channel @xmath15 a dedicated soft - insertion routine @xcite is used for the generation of the phase space .",
    "the second calculation uses for the lo @xmath3 processes and the @xmath15 process optimized code obtained from a feynman diagrammatic approach . as in the calculation described before standard techniques like color decomposition and the use of helicity amplitudes",
    "are employed . for",
    "the @xmath4 processes including light quarks , _ madgraph _",
    "@xcite has been used .",
    "the subtraction terms according to are obtained in a semi - automatized manner based on an in - house library written in _",
    "in the following we consistently use the cteq6 @xcite set of parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) . in detail , we take cteq6l1 pdfs with a 1-loop running @xmath16 in lo and cteq6 m pdfs with a 2-loop running @xmath16 in nlo .",
    "the number of active flavours is @xmath17 , and the respective qcd parameters are @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "note that the top - quark loop in the gluon self - energy is subtracted at zero momentum . in this scheme",
    "the running of @xmath16 is generated solely by the contributions of the light quark and gluon loops .",
    "the top - quark mass is renormalized in the on - shell scheme , as numerical value we take @xmath20 .",
    "we apply the jet algorithm of with @xmath21 for the definition of the tagged hard jet . unless stated otherwise we require a transverse momentum of @xmath22 for the hardest jet .",
    "the outgoing ( anti-)top - quarks are neither affected by the jet algorithm nor by the phase - space cut .",
    "note that the lo prediction and the virtual corrections are not influenced by the jet algorithm , but the real corrections are .",
    "-1      in the scale dependence of the nlo cross sections is shown .",
    "for comparison , the lo results are included as well .",
    "varying the scale in the usual range that is a factor 2 up and down around a central scale we observe a reduction of the scale dependence of a factor 3 at tevatron and about a factor 6 at the lhc . from the absolute values of the cross sections",
    "one concludes that indeed a significant contribution to the inclusive top - quark pair cross section comes from @xmath0 . for reasonable scale choices one can also observe that the nlo corrections are of moderate size . in particular around @xmath23",
    "the corrections are small . the interference of @xmath24-odd contributions of the amplitude with @xmath24-even parts , where @xmath24 denotes the charge conjugation , produces a forward  backward charge asymmetry at the tevatron .",
    "for the inclusive top - quark pair sample , where this asymmetry is an nlo effect , this has been studied in . in the case of @xmath0",
    "this asymmetry appears already in lo . in lo",
    "the asymmetry is defined by @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the rapidity of the top - quark .",
    "cross - section contributions @xmath27 @xmath28 correspond to top - quarks in the forward or backward hemispheres , respectively , where incoming protons fly into the forward direction by definition . denoting the corresponding nlo contributions to the cross sections by @xmath29",
    ", we define the asymmetry at nlo by @xmath30 i.e.  via a consistent expansion in @xmath16 .",
    "note , however , that the lo cross sections in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nloasym ] ) are evaluated in the nlo setup ( pdfs , @xmath16 ) .",
    "the results for the asymmetry for different scale choices are shown in . at lo",
    "we find an asymmetry of about @xmath33% .",
    "the scale dependence is rather small .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that @xmath34 cancels exactly between the numerator and the denominator .",
    "in addition the residual factorization scale dependence also cancels to a large extent in the ratio . at nlo",
    "we find a large correction compared to the lo result .",
    "the asymmetry is almost washed out at nlo .",
    "the scale dependence is increased in nlo which seems natural given the small dependence in lo .",
    "to investigate the origin of the large nlo corrections to the asymmetry we studied the dependence on @xmath35 , the minimal @xmath36 used to resolve the additional jet .",
    "the results are shown in . a strong dependence of the cross section on @xmath35 is observed . for all @xmath35 values",
    "we find that the nlo corrections to the cross section are of moderate size .",
    "while the cross section evidently has a large sensitivity on @xmath35 , the dependence of the asymmetry on @xmath35 is slightly less pronounced . on the other hand",
    "we find , independent of the chosen @xmath35 , a significant difference between lo and nlo for the asymmetry indicating that the definition of the asymmetry is not stable with respect to higher - order corrections independent of the @xmath35 value .        in the rapidity distribution for the top - quark",
    "one can easily observe the asymmetry of the lo distribution leading to the aforementioned @xmath33% for the integrated asymmetry .",
    "the nlo corrections are different in shape compared to lo .",
    "they are larger in the forward direction than in the backward direction .",
    "the result is that the asymmetry is washed out by the nlo correction . in the lower plot of the @xmath38-factor and the scale dependence",
    "the corrections are between @xmath3920 and @xmath3940% .",
    "the large scale dependence of the lo result is again significantly improved when the nlo corrections are taken into account . in the @xmath36-distribution of the top - quark",
    "now for the lhc . for not too large @xmath36 the corrections are of moderate size .",
    "starting with @xmath3930 % for small @xmath36 and reaching @xmath4050 % at @xmath41 , indicating that the @xmath38-factor is strongly phase - space dependent .",
    "up to a @xmath36 of about 450 we also find an important improvement of the scale uncertainty .",
    "* conclusions : * predictions for @xmath42jet production at hadron colliders have been reviewed at nlo qcd . for the cross section",
    "the nlo corrections drastically reduce the scale dependence of the lo predictions , which is of the order of 100% .",
    "the charge asymmetry of the top - quarks , which is measured at the tevatron , is significantly decreased at nlo and is almost washed out by the residual scale dependence . in addition",
    "we have studied the @xmath35-dependence of the asymmetry in nlo .",
    "further refinements of the precise definition of the charge asymmetry are required to stabilize the predictions with respect to higher - order corrections .",
    "first results for differential distributions have been presented .",
    "the corrections are well under control over a large phase - space region and the scale uncertainty is again improved compared to the lo results .",
