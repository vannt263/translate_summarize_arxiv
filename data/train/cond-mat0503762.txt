    "the minority game ( mg ) and related models allowed to elucidate many aspects of the critical behavior of systems of heterogeneous inductive agents , with special emphasis on financial markets , by addressing directly the interplay between microscopic behavior and macroscopic properties  including fluctuations , market impact , predictability and efficiency  in rather elementary and often exactly solvable settings @xcite . besides providing a surprisingly rich description of the phase structure of an idealized speculative market @xcite ,",
    "mg - based models are also able to reproduce to some extent the empirical price statistics ( the so - called ` stylized facts ' @xcite ) of financial markets @xcite .",
    "however , the emergence of the peculiar dynamical regimes characterizing real systems , with intermittent fluctuation outbursts ( volatility clustering ) and the formation and destruction of trends , is only partially captured by standard mgs .",
    "this is in part due to the fact that the critical window where empirical phenomenology is observed typically shrinks as the system size increases , indicating that stylized facts would require a significant amount of fine tuning of the parameters and ultimately marginal efficiency @xcite . moreover , the dynamics of these models usually displays a strong dependence on both the disorder sample and the initial conditions @xcite",
    ". it would therefore be desirable to devise a simple microscopic mechanism that is able to generate a realistic dynamical structure in a robust way while preserving the fundamental physical content of mgs .",
    "several studies in financial market microstructure suggest that these peculiarities emerge from the coexistence of different types of traders , and point the attention especially on ` fundamentalists ' and ` chartists ' @xcite . the former trade on the spread between the actual and the expected price ( the ` fundamental ' ) trying to profit from fluctuations ; the latter look for trends in the price history and follow the expected drift",
    ". the common picture has it that in market phases dominated by fundamentalists the price follows the fundamental , whereas when chartist pressure prevails trends deviating from the fundamental ( bubbles ) occur .",
    "moreover , switches between the two phases , during which agents revise their expectations over a certain time span , are possibly accompanied by activity outbursts .",
    "the expectations of agents in mgs are implicitly encoded in the reinforcement term of the learning dynamics .",
    "they are usually fixed : agents behave as fundamentalists in mgs and as chartists in majority games @xcite . to implement the mechanism discussed above means therefore to modify the learning process so as to allow agents to change their expectations , and hence their character , in time according to the market conditions they perceive .",
    "one possible way to do this was introduced in @xcite . in a nutshell ,",
    "the idea is that when price movements are small agents should try to look for profit opportunities in emerging trends while when large price changes occur they should perceive a greater risk as the market behaves more chaotically , and return to a more cautious conduct .",
    "the passage from one attitude to the other is provided by a parameter that tunes the agents risk - sensitivity  or the trade - off between expected profit and perceived risk  so that when price movements exceed a given threshold the risk perceived by agents is large and they play a mg ( that is , they select strategies that effectively try to follow the fundamental ) preferentially . when coupled to a random external information structure , this mechanism was shown to lead to the formation of ` heavy tails ' in the distribution of returns in a large ` critical ' window where a crossover from a fundamentalist - dominated to a trend - followers dominated market takes place .    here",
    "we discuss this setting further by considering a somewhat simpler but more transparent model in order to address the role of the information structure , particularly on the system dynamics .",
    "this is an especially crucial point in analyzing the interaction between trend - followers and contrarians , since trend - following behavior is expected to introduce a strong bias in the endogenous information dynamics .",
    "we will indeed see that a small trend - following attitude is sufficient to drastically change both the typical stationary - state macroscopic properties and the single - sample dynamical properties with respect to the random information case .",
    "we will proceed by adding increasingly complex information structures to the simplest possible model ( without information ) , which is introduced in section 2 . in section 3 the case of random external information",
    "is considered while in section 4 we address the case of ` real ' endogenous information .",
    "finally , we formulate some concluding remarks in section 5 .",
    "let us consider the following setup .",
    "each of @xmath0 agents ( @xmath1 ) must decide whether to buy ( @xmath2 ) or sell ( @xmath3 ) at each time step @xmath4 .",
    "the success of agent @xmath5 at time @xmath6 is measured by the payoff function @xmath7\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the aggregate bid ( or ` excess demand ' , which serves as a proxy for price movements ) . the function @xmath9 encodes the type of game being played and , implicitly , the agents expectations .",
    "if @xmath9 is a constant , agents are either playing a majority game ( for @xmath10 , @xmath11 if @xmath5 acts according to the majority ) or a minority game ( for @xmath12 , @xmath11 if @xmath5 acts according to the minority ) .",
    "agents thus behave as trend - followers in the former case and as fundamentalists in the latter .",
    "we want to address a more general case in which agents are able to modify their character depending on the size of market fluctuations .",
    "we assume that they behave as trend - followers ( resp . fundamentalists ) when price movements are small ( resp .",
    "large ) and the perceived risk is small ( resp .",
    "the simplest function for our scope is perhaps @xmath13 where @xmath14 if @xmath15 is true ( and @xmath16 otherwise ) and @xmath17 is a threshold , so that then @xmath18 agents perceive the game as a majority game , whereas for @xmath19 they revert to a minority game . for the sake of simplicity , in what follows",
    "we assume that @xmath20 .",
    "we imagine that in order to make their decisions agents employ the following iterated probabilistic rule ( @xmath21 ) : @xmath22/n\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is a constant ( the ` learning rate ' of agents ) and @xmath24 are independent , identically distributed quenched random variables with zero mean and variance 1 for @xmath1   and @xmath25 and the function @xmath9 itself could be different for different agents .",
    "we however drop this source of heterogeneity in order to focus on the effects induced by risk sensitivity . on the other hand ,",
    "it is obvious that the heterogeneity of initial conditions @xmath24 can not be dropped , since @xmath26 is independent on @xmath5 for all @xmath6 and the dynamics would be completely trivial if the starting point was the same for everybody . ] , and consider the properties of the steady state of the dynamics .",
    "we will see that , in spite of its extreme simplicity , this model is sufficient to capture one of the key features induced by this scheme .",
    "let us see , for a start , the behavior of the time average of the excess demand @xmath27 ( where the average is taken in the steady state of the dynamics ) . in a majority game ( @xmath28 or @xmath29 )",
    "one finds @xmath30 , implying that one of the two possible actions is systematically preferred ( a trend ) , while @xmath31 in a pure mg ( @xmath32 or @xmath33 ) .",
    "intuition suggests that for a sufficiently small @xmath17 the latter scenario will dominate , since agents will be extremely risk - sensitive . on the other hand , for a sufficiently large @xmath17 agents will be more risk - prone and a majority - game scenario is expected .",
    "the crossover between these two regimes is displayed in fig .",

    "it is also instructive to look at the crossover in the second moment @xmath39 , recalling that in a majority game , @xmath39 is of order @xmath40 for any @xmath25 , while in a pure mg ( see also insets in fig . [ one ] ) @xmath39 is of order @xmath0 for small @xmath25 and becomes of order @xmath40 for large enough @xmath25 .",
    "finally , a deeper insight may be obtained from the correlation function @xmath41 ( see fig . [ two ] ) .",

    "the former regime is characteristic of minority games , where price increments are one - step anti - correlated because agents effectively act so as to compensate price increments in one direction with subsequent increments in the other direction .",
    "the latter regime is instead typical of trends and majority games .",
    "this coexistence of mg - like and of majority - game - like features is at odds with mixed models in which each agent is either a fundamentalist or a chartist and is not allowed to pass from one group to the other @xcite . in that case , the macroscopic properties are essentially determined by the larger group ( be it fundamentalists or trend - followers ) , whose expectations are fulfilled . here",
    ", the risk sensitivity determines which group of traders dominates and mixed phenomenology occurs in a range of values of the learning rate @xmath25 .",
    "while the detailed physical picture becomes more articulate , this conclusion actually extends to models endowed with more complicated information structure .",
    "let us move over to the usual mg setting , namely a system of @xmath0 agents who at each time step @xmath6 must formulate a binary bid ( buy / sell ) based on some public information pattern @xmath47 .",
    "one such pattern is given to agents at every time step ; it is assumed that the number of possible patterns is @xmath48 and that @xmath48 scales linearly with @xmath0 .",
    "the relevant control parameter is indeed the relative number of information patterns @xmath49 . in order to translate informations into bids each agent",
    "disposes of @xmath50 strategies , each one predicting the outcomes @xmath51 ( @xmath1 ; @xmath52 ; @xmath53 ) , and aims at selecting , at each time step , the one that delivers him the highest expected profit .",
    "if we denote this optimal strategy as @xmath54 , the agent s bid at time @xmath6 is then given by @xmath55 .",
    "as usual , we assume that strategies have quenched random components drawn independently from @xmath56 with equal probability . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the case @xmath57 .",
    "the single - agent dynamics is defined by the following rules : @xmath58\\nonumber\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where each @xmath59 , called the ` score ' in mg jargon , measures the performance of strategy @xmath60 of agent @xmath5 . at each time step",
    ", every agent chooses his best - performing strategy as the one with the highest score and formulates the corresponding bid .",
    "subsequently , bids are aggregated into the excess demand @xmath61 , that we have now normalized for future convenience , and scores are updated .",
    "it is assumed here that scores are initialized at time @xmath62 in such a way that @xmath63 for all @xmath5 and @xmath60 ( ` unbiased ' or ` flat ' initial conditions ) .",
    "we will not address here the important and subtle issues of if and how the steady state changes when a non - zero initial bias is used .    in this section ,",
    "the information structure is assumed to correspond to the random external case : @xmath47 is an integer drawn randomly and independently at each time step from @xmath64 with uniform probability @xcite . in this case",
    "the model is markovian and the information dynamics covers uniformly the state space @xmath64 . as for @xmath9 , we can borrow the recipe employed in the previous section and set : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a tunable constant ( notice that @xmath61 is of order @xmath67 in this case ) .",
    "different choices are also possible . for example , linearizing ( [ nostra2 ] ) one obtains @xmath68 which is equally well suited for our purposes . the main difference with the piecewise constant case lies in the fact that payoffs ( which , we remind , are proportional to @xmath69 $ ] ) are a non - linear function of the aggregate bid . such non - linear choices ,",
    "one of which was considered in @xcite , lead to the emergence of a clear non - gaussian statistics for @xmath61 at small values of @xmath70 . here",
    "we wish to concentrate on the role of information structures and therefore we may restrict ourselves to the somewhat simpler form ( [ nostra2 ] ) .",
    "we will analyze the macroscopic properties in the steady state using @xmath70 and @xmath71 as control parameters .",
    "our attention will be mostly focused on : ( a ) the volatility @xmath72 measuring the magnitude of global fluctuations ( notice that @xmath31 by construction ) ; ( b ) the ` predictability ' @xmath73 where @xmath74 stands for the time average of @xmath75 conditioned on the occurrence of the pattern @xmath76 , quantifying the presence of exploitable information ( if @xmath77 the minority action can be statistically predicted on the basis of the information pattern alone at least for some @xmath76 ) ; and finally ( c ) the ( normalized ) one - step autocorrelation function @xmath78 , which indicates the dominating component of the market ( if @xmath79 returns are positively correlated and trend - followers dominate ) .",

    "<S> the minority game framework was recently generalized to account for the possibility that agents adapt not only through strategy selection but also by diversifying their response according to the kind of dynamical regime , or the risk , they perceive . here </S>",
    "<S> we study the effects of this mechanism in different information structures . </S>",
    "<S> we show that both the stationary macroscopic properties and the dynamical features depend strongly on whether the information supplied to the system is exogenous ( ` random ' ) or endogenous ( ` real ' ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , in the latter case one observes that a small amount of herding tendency suffices to alter the collective behavior dramatically . in such cases , </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics is characterized by the creation and destruction of trends , accompanied by intermittent features like volatility clustering .    ,    and    minority games , risk , trend - followers , contrarians , volatility clustering </S>"
