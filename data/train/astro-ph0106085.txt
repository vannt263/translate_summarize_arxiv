    "this was attributed to local inhomogeneities in the interstellar medium ( ism ) . in the present work",

    "the present study is purely phenomenological and confined to @xmath11}<-1 $ ] where type ia supernovae ( snia , an fe source ) and low mass agb stars ( the dominant @xmath10-process source ) would not contribute significantly to the ism . as pointed out by truran ( 1981 ) , abundances of neutron - capture elements ( e.g. , ba ) at low [ fe / h ] are dominated by @xmath0-process contributions from snii .",

    "we will present the abundances resulting from production by the first generations of stars formed after the big bang and yields for two hypothesized types of snii .",
    "these results will be inferred from the observational data and not from theoretical models for the first generations of stars or for @xmath0-process production by snii .",
    "the @xmath0-process abundances ( @xmath0-abundances ) calculated from our model for ump and mp stars will be compared with the observational data .",
    "more specifically , the @xmath0-abundance of an element that represents the total abundance of all @xmath0-process isotopes of the element is calculated for comparison with observations as there are no data on isotopic @xmath0-abundances in stars other than the sun .",
    "when referring to @xmath0-process nuclei , we consider both those that are the direct products of a rapid neutron capture scenario and those that may be produced by other processes closely related to the @xmath0-process in the same snii event .",
    "the latter would include many nuclei with atomic masses of @xmath12 that would be made in the @xmath13-process ( woosley & hoffman 1992 ) .",
    "if a sufficient neutron abundance existed at the end of the @xmath13-process , the nuclei with @xmath12 would become the seed nuclei to capture the neutrons during the subsequent @xmath0-process .",
    "otherwise , these nuclei would experience no further processing and be a part of the snii ejecta .",
    "the @xmath13-process could be the dominant source of sr , y and zr .",
    "it is assumed here that snii are the source of @xmath0-process nuclei ( @xmath0-nuclei ) .",
    "the abundances of the @xmath0-nuclei @xmath14hf and @xmath15i in the early solar system are well established .",
    "these data require that the snii responsible for @xmath14hf not produce any significant amounts of @xmath15i [ wasserburg , busso , & gallino 1996 ( wbg ) ] .",
    "the frequency of this type of snii was argued to be @xmath16 for a standard reference mass of hydrogen ( see  [ model2 ] ) .",
    "the nuclide @xmath15i was attributed to a different type of snii with a frequency of @xmath17 .",
    "these hypothetical snii types are called @xmath3 and @xmath4 events for the `` high '' and `` low '' frequency types , respectively .",
    "this approach assigns the dominant production of nuclei with @xmath6 ( `` heavy '' @xmath0-nuclei ) to the @xmath3 events and the nuclei with @xmath7 ( `` light '' @xmath0-nuclei ) to the @xmath4 events .",
    "qian , vogel , & wasserburg ( 1998 ) developed a simple @xmath0-process model involving neutrinos to examine the different conditions in @xmath3 and @xmath4 events that are needed to provide a split between the production of heavy and light @xmath0-nuclei at @xmath18 . due to their much higher frequency",
    ", the @xmath3 events were expected to be likely the first snii to inject @xmath0-nuclei into the ism ( wbg ) .",

    "this clearly indicates that heavy @xmath0-elements , including the chronometer th , are produced without any significant coproduction of fe , thus requiring that heavy @xmath0-elements and fe be produced in different types of snii .",

    "1995 ; mcwilliam 1998 ) .",
    "wasserburg & qian [ 2000 ( wq ) ] inferred that the large dispersion in eu and ba abundances at [ fe / h]@xmath21 was caused by @xmath3 events adding heavy @xmath0-elements but no fe to a pre - existing inventory of elements in the ism .",
    "this pre - existing inventory of fe and associated elements was called the initial or prompt ( hereafter @xmath22 ) inventory and attributed to the first generations of very massive ( @xmath23 ) stars formed from big bang debris .",

    "this inferred abundance ( upper cross ) is within @xmath28  dex of the preliminary ba data on cs 31082 - 001 ( lower cross ) reported by hill et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . as discussed above , the large scatter in ba abundance at @xmath29}<-2.5 $ ] shown in figure [ ba ]",
    "is attributed to the rapid occurrence of @xmath3 events shortly after the onset of normal star formation .",
    "the scenario adopted here for the evolution of @xmath0-process related elements over galactic history is schematically shown in table [ epoch ] .",
    "some time after the big bang , baryonic matter condenses in dark matter potential wells .",
    "only very massive stars can form from big bang debris .",
    "these stars explode and contribute newly - synthesized material . the number of such events is not known but many such disrupting events may be required to give [ fe / h ]  @xmath9 in an average parcel of the ism or igm ( intergalactic medium ) .",
    "the ism or igm now has a changed chemical composition compared with big bang debris .",
    "when some of this material cools , there is condensation of gas to form a more or less normal stellar population that includes the progenitors for snii @xmath3 and @xmath4 events and lower mass stars .",
    "this state of condensation can be achieved when the abundance of all metals in the ism or igm reaches or surpasses some critical value .",
    "a nominal value of [ fe / h ]  @xmath9 for the critical `` metallicity '' was inferred by wq from the observational data on ump stars .",
    "this appears to be supported by the recent results of bromm et al .",
    "( 2001 ) who have simulated the collapse and fragmentation of gas clouds with different metallicities .",
    "the nominal value [ fe / h ]  @xmath9 will be used below for the @xmath22-inventory of fe although the onset of `` normal '' astration may correspond to a possible range of @xmath30 } < -2.7 $ ] .",
    "the first snii to contribute @xmath0-elements to the ism are the most frequent and most probable @xmath3 events . on a timescale of @xmath31  yr",
    ", the relative contributions of @xmath3 and @xmath4 events should approach well - defined values that are determined by the average frequency ratio of @xmath32 and the yields of these events . from then on the evolution of @xmath0-elements and fe",
    "would progress as if there were only one type of snii with small statistical deviations ( see the evolution of ba abundance relative to fe at [ fe / h ]  @xmath33 indicated by the dot - dashed line in figure [ ba ] ) . at [ fe / h ]",
    "@xmath34 , snia begin to contribute and dominate the fe production , as inferred from the o data ( e.g. , timmes et al . 1995 ; qian & wasserburg 2001a ) .",
    "this approach sharply separates heavy element production in the earliest epochs [ ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) in table [ epoch ] ] from later production by snii [ ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) ] and from even later production by snia and contributions of evolved normal low - mass stars .",
    "the numbers of @xmath3 and especially @xmath4 events through epochs ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) are not very large ( see  [ nhl ] ) so that a discrete model is required .    for simplicity it is assumed that each @xmath3 or @xmath4 event has a fixed relative abundance pattern for the elements produced in each case and that the yields are constant for each @xmath3 or @xmath4 event .",
    "the average frequencies of these events are also assumed to be constant for a standard reference mass of hydrogen .",
    "the main results of the model only depend on the assumption of fixed yield patterns for @xmath3 and @xmath4 events ( see   [ model2][nhl ] ) .",
    "the key parameters of the model that must be determined by consideration of the observational data are the yields of @xmath3 and @xmath4 events for pertinent elements and the @xmath22-inventory composition that defines the baseline to which the contributions of @xmath3 and @xmath4 events are added .",
    "as we are concerned with the addition of elements to the ism or igm whose hydrogen mass fraction is essentially not altered during galactic chemical evolution , we will typically use a representation where the abundances are given relative to hydrogen .",
    "this is the standard spectroscopic notation @xmath35 for element e where e is also used to represent the number of e atoms .",
    "the common notation [ e / fe ] complicates the discussion and is avoided here as ranges in [ e / fe ] may result from addition of either element e or fe .",
    "consider a homogeneous system of gas with a time - dependent total number h of hydrogen atoms .",
    "the rate of change in the total number e of e atoms in this gas may be written as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the total rate for injection of element e into the gas after production by its sources , and the last term accounts for the removal of matter from the gas by either astration or fragmentation ( @xmath38 for both cases ) .",
    "the above equation may be rewritten as @xmath39 thus , if snii @xmath3 and @xmath4 events are the only sources under consideration for element e and the snii frequencies are proportional to the amount of hydrogen in the gas , then equation ( [ dehdt ] ) reduces to the following for a homogeneous mass of gas : @xmath40 or in the spectroscopic notation , @xmath41 in equation ( [ eh ] ) , ( e / h)@xmath42 is the @xmath22-inventory , ( e / h)@xmath43 or ( e / h)@xmath44 is the number of e atoms produced per hydrogen atom in the gas phase by each @xmath3 or @xmath4 event for a standard reference mass of hydrogen that is assumed here to mix with the ejecta in each case , and @xmath45 or @xmath46 is the number of @xmath3 or @xmath4 events that have occurred in this reference mass .    now consider the mixture of two different gas systems ( with subscripts `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' ) that have different nucleosynthetic histories . for fixed values of ( e / h)@xmath42 , ( e / h)@xmath43 , and ( e / h)@xmath44 , the abundance of element e in the mixture of two gas masses",
    "can be written as @xmath47 where    @xmath48    it can be seen that a mixture of two gas systems with different nucleosynthetic histories will result in a new system with effective values of @xmath49 and @xmath50 corresponding to the weighted averages of the contributing systems . as a result ,",
    "all that mixing will do is change the values of @xmath45 and @xmath46 but still produce abundance patterns congruent to those resulting from @xmath3 and @xmath4 events .",
    "if the absolute yields of @xmath3 and @xmath4 events were to shift but the relative yields of one element to the other be maintained in each type of event , then the only result of this shift would again be to change @xmath45 and @xmath46 but the same congruence of abundance patterns would be maintained .",
    "it follows that a wide range of removal by astration and mixing of matter with different chemical evolution lead to a result that is indistinguishable from a simple history if the @xmath22-inventory composition and the basic relative yield templates of @xmath3 and @xmath4 events are fixed as assumed in this model .",
    "thus complex mixing and transport models are not required to pursue the approach used here but are effectively represented by the @xmath45 and @xmath46 values for a star .",
    "if the model assumptions are correct , then they provide a full basis for quantitatively determining the @xmath0-abundances in ump and mp stars .",
    "the frequencies of @xmath3 and @xmath4 events inferred from the abundances of @xmath14hf and @xmath15i in the early solar system , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively , correspond to a reference mass of hydrogen of @xmath53 for a total snii rate of @xmath54 and a total gas mass of @xmath55 in the present galaxy ( qian & wasserburg 2001a ) .",
    "this reference mass is also the total amount of ism typically swept by an snii remnant ( e.g. , thornton et al .",
    "we take this as the standard reference mass of hydrogen to mix with the nucleosynthetic products of an snii @xmath3 or @xmath4 event .",
    "we will use equation ( [ eps ] ) with fixed parameters @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 to discuss abundances in ump and mp stars .",
    "all quantities in this equation will be calculated for the above reference mass of hydrogen .",
    "the absolute yield of element e in units of mass for an @xmath3 or @xmath4 event , @xmath59 or @xmath60 , can be estimated from the relationships :    @xmath61    where @xmath62 or @xmath63 is the average atomic mass for the e isotopes produced in an @xmath3 or @xmath4 event .    in discussing the stellar observations , we consider that the observed stars formed from the immediate precursor ism with the homogenized @xmath0-abundances of that local region . these @xmath0-abundances are not considered to have been altered by the subsequent evolution of the star .",
    "if the surface of a star is contaminated by some form of mass transfer from a companion ( or nearby ) snii , then the observed abundance pattern should represent the products of that snii ( an @xmath3 or @xmath4 event ) , but the abundances would be greatly enhanced from those with which the star formed .",
    "for example , the extremely high ba abundances in cs 31082 - 001 ( crosses linked by a line ) and cs 22892 - 052 ( open circle ) shown in figure [ ba ] may have resulted from surface contamination by the snii explosion ( of the @xmath3 type ) of their respective binary companions ( qw ) .",
    "the issue of what level of @xmath0-process enrichment is so large that an snii companion ( or neighbor ) appears to be required has been discussed by qw and will be considered below ( see  [ syzbump ] ) .      given the @xmath22-inventory , @xmath56 , and the yields of @xmath3 and @xmath4 events , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , the abundance of element e in a star , @xmath64 , can be calculated from equation ( [ eps ] ) .",
    "the numbers of contributing @xmath3 and @xmath4 events for the star , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , are required for this calculation .",
    "if a certain element is exclusively produced by @xmath3 or @xmath4 events , then @xmath45 or @xmath46 can be simply obtained from the observed abundance of this element in the star by using the yield of an @xmath3 or @xmath4 event for this element .",
    "data on ba ( @xmath65 ) at @xmath66<-3 $ ] ( mcwilliam et al . 1995 ; mcwilliam 1998 ) indicate that the @xmath22-inventory of heavy @xmath0-elements is negligible ( wq ; see figure [ ba ] ) .",
    "observations also show that the abundances of ba and above in ump stars very closely follow the solar @xmath0-abundance pattern ( sneden et al .",
    "1996 , 2000 ; westin et al .",
    "we consider that @xmath3 events are the exclusive source for the heavy @xmath0-elements above ba ( possibly including ba ) with a yield pattern identical to the corresponding part of the solar @xmath0-abundance pattern ( see   [ phcomp ] and [ heavy ] ) .",
    "then the @xmath3-yield of any heavy @xmath0-element above ba can be used to calculate the value @xmath45 for a star .",
    "we use eu ( @xmath67 ) for this purpose as it is typically observed in ump and mp stars and its solar inventory is dominated by @xmath0-process contributions .",
    "specifically , the solar @xmath0-abundance of eu , @xmath68 ( arlandini et al . 1999 ) , was contributed by @xmath69 @xmath3 events for a frequency of @xmath70 over a period of @xmath71  yr prior to solar system formation ( ssf ; see  [ nhlsun ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath72 . the value @xmath45 for a star",
    "is then : @xmath73    as little or no fe is produced in @xmath3 events ( see  [ model1 ] ) , we consider that the fe abundance at @xmath74<-1 $ ] results from contributions of @xmath4 events being added to the @xmath22-inventory : @xmath75 as snia were the dominant fe source at [ fe / h ]  @xmath76 , only a fraction @xmath77 of the solar fe inventory @xmath78 ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) was contributed by snii @xmath4 events . for @xmath79 ( e.g. , timmes et al . 1995 ; qian & wasserburg 2001a ) and with @xmath80 contributing @xmath4 events for a frequency of @xmath81 over a period of @xmath71  yr prior to ssf ( see  [ nhlsun ] ) , @xmath82 corresponding to [ fe / h]@xmath83 .",
    "we take @xmath84 corresponding to [ fe / h]@xmath85 .",
    "the @xmath22-inventory of fe is overwhelmed by fe addition from a few @xmath4 events .",

    "for @xmath4 events a similar expression applies : @xmath93 the variances of the distributions in equations ( [ pnht ] ) and ( [ pnlt ] ) are @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "the square root of the variance , @xmath96 or @xmath97 , can be used as a measure of the variation in @xmath45 or @xmath46 at time @xmath89 : @xmath98 or @xmath99 . at @xmath100  yr ,",

    "the abundances of heavy @xmath0-elements ( e.g. , eu ) are a better measure of time because of the higher frequency of @xmath3 events , and hence much lower dispersion in @xmath45 .",
    "thus it follows that there is a substantial dispersion in [ fe / h ] for a rather fixed abundance of any heavy @xmath0-element at any given time in the range @xmath114  yr .",
    "conversely , a given [ fe / h ] value may correspond to a significant range of possible times .",

    "the dispersion and mean trends for abundances of heavy and light @xmath0-elements in ump and mp stars have been discussed in some detail by qian ( 2001 ) based on the same approach .    as discussed in  1.2 , the complex history of mixing and transport of elements in the ism from which a star formed is represented by @xmath45 and @xmath46 for the star .",
    "it is shown above that these numbers can be calculated from the observed eu and fe abundances in the star by using the @xmath3-yield of eu and the @xmath4-yield of fe . substituting the expressions for @xmath45 ( eq . [ [ eu ] ] ) and @xmath46 ( eq . [ [ epsfe ] ] or [ [ fe ] ] ) into the expression for the abundance of element e ( eq . [ [ eh ] ] or [ [ eps ] ] )",

    "thus the fundamental problem in our approach to understand abundances in ump and mp stars is to establish the @xmath22-inventory composition and the yield templates of @xmath3 and @xmath4 events that underlie the observations .",

    "we assume here that the solar abundances are representative of an average parcel of the ism at the time of ssf .",
    "we use the values @xmath122 and @xmath123 to account for the part of the solar inventory that was contributed by snii over a total uniform production time of @xmath124  yr prior to ssf .",

    "[ model2 ] , this frequency can be explained by considering the galactic snii rate per unit mass of gas and the total amount of ism typically swept up by an snii remnant .",
    "although there may be a range of possible values for @xmath128 , the observed abundances of heavy @xmath0-elements in ump and mp stars appear to be well represented by the @xmath3-yields of these elements calculated by using @xmath69 .",
    "for example , the lowest eu abundances observed in such stars ( e.g. , mcwilliam et al .",
    "1995 ; burris et al .",
    "2000 ) are remarkably close to the eu yield of a single @xmath3 event [ @xmath129 calculated from the solar @xmath0-inventory of eu for @xmath69 . in any case , a change in @xmath130 causes only a uniform shift in the @xmath3-yields of the relevant elements as the yield template is assumed here to be fixed .",
    "such a shift will not affect the basic results presented here ( see   [ model2][nhl ] ) .",
    "the timescale for replenishment of fresh @xmath15i in an average parcel of the ism required by the meteoritic data is much longer than its lifetime and corresponds to a frequency of @xmath131 for @xmath4 events .",
    "a decrease in the replenishment timescale ( corresponding to an increase in @xmath88 ) would cause an exponential increase in the abundance of @xmath15i in the early solar system ( ess ) .",

    "a decrease in @xmath137 by a factor of 2 gives [ fe / h]@xmath138 , which means that there would be a lack of stars between [ fe / h ]  @xmath9 and @xmath139 .",

    "the @xmath157 values cited above and adopted for our initial calculations will be shown to result in a mismatch between the calculated sr , y , zr , and ba abundances and the observational data on mp stars .",
    "it is widely recognized in the field that the abundances of sr , y and zr are problematic , particularly at low metallicities , relative to any current nucleosynthetic models ( m. busso & r. gallino , personal communication ) . while we also explore other explanations for the mismatch between our model results and data ( see  [ dis ] ) , we feel that it is reasonable to consider the uncertainties in the solar @xmath10-component for sr , y , zr , and ba .",
    "it is possible that the same uncertainties may also affect other elements whose @xmath157 values are not small .",
    "the @xmath22-inventory and @xmath3 and @xmath4 yields are the key input to our model .",

    "2000 ) correspond to @xmath161 , 7 , and 36 ( see table [ syzph ] ) .",
    "the abundances of element e other than eu in two ump stars with different @xmath45 provide a pair of equations in the form of equation ( [ ump ] ) with two unknown parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",

    "recently , bromm et al . (",
    "2001 ) have shown that a gas cloud with a baryon mass of @xmath169 and @xmath170 fails to undergo continued collapse and fragmentation whereas for @xmath171 the cloud can collapse and undergo vigorous fragmentation , leading to a large relative population of low mass clumps compared with the case of @xmath172 ( big bang debris ) .",
    "the phenomenological and dynamical views thus appear to be in accord for the moment .",

    "we have chosen a nominal value of [ fe / h]@xmath85 in the above calculation of the @xmath22-component .",

    "however , elements such as sr , y , and zr associated with the @xmath22-inventory are directly related to the prompt fe production .",
    "it follows that @xmath175 for these elements will be shifted with @xmath176 depending on the precise value of [ fe / h ] at which normal astration began . in comparing the @xmath22-components of element e for ump stars , it is therefore necessary to correct to a standard value of [ fe / h ] in order to obtain the @xmath22-inventory of element e relative to fe .",
