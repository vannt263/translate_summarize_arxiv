    "issues of quantum measurement in mesoscopic systems have recently garnered considerable interest , both because of their relevance to attempts at quantum computation @xcite and quantum - limited amplifiers @xcite .",
    "a general consequence of any quantum measurement is that it must induce decoherence in the system variable conjugate to that being measured .",
    "this basic fact naturally leads to the issue of measurement efficiency : what conditions must a particular detector satisfy so that it induces the _ absolute minimum _ amount of dephasing required by quantum mechanics ?",
    "this minimum dephasing rate is identical to the measurement rate @xmath0 , the rate at which information is extracted during the measurement process ; thus , the measurement efficiency ratio @xmath1 is defined by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the measurement - induced dephasing rate .",
    "besides being of great conceptual interest , near - ideal measurement schemes are necessary to detect signatures of coherent qubit oscillations in the output noise of a detector @xcite , and are essential if one wishes to construct a quantum limited amplifier ( i.e.  an amplifier whose noise energy is the minimum allowed by quantum mechanics ) @xcite .",
    "while the question of measurement efficiency has received attention in the context of general measurement theory @xcite , it is only recently that it has been considered in the context of solid state detectors .",
    "averin @xcite has considered the status of the quantum limit in a number of solid state detectors , while recently pilgram and bttiker @xcite considered the quantum limit for a system in which a mesoscopic conductor acts as a detector .    in this paper , we formulate general conditions which are needed for an arbitrary detector in the linear - response regime to reach the quantum limit of detection , where @xmath4 .",
    "these general conditions are valid for both interacting and non - interacting systems , and can be given a direct physical interpretation .",
    "we also discuss the quantum limit in terms of a simple concept from quantum information theory , the accessible information . to make these considerations more concrete ,",
    "we apply them to a mesoscopic scattering detector similar to that considered in ref . , identifying precise conditions and symmetries needed to reach the quantum limit .",
    "we find that the required symmetries are most easily understood if one considers the scattering detector in terms of information ; these symmetries are not the same as those usually considered in mesoscopic systems .",
    "for example , we find that time reversal symmetry is not necessary for reaching the quantum limit .",
    "we also find that , surprisingly , an adiabatic point contact @xcite system remains a quantum limited detector even for voltages large enough that several channels contribute to transport and that the energy dependence of scattering is important ; previous studies @xcite have only shown that the quantum limit is achieved in the small voltage regime .",
    "our results for the mesoscopic scattering detector are complementary to those obtained in ref . .",
    "we start by considering a generic system consisting of a qubit ( i.e.  a two - level system described as a spin @xmath5 ) coupled to an arbitrary detector .",
    "the system hamiltonian is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and we leave @xmath9 unspecified .",
    "@xmath10 is the detector ",

    "we work in the weak - coupling regime ( @xmath13 ) , and can thus use linear response theory to describe the output of detector . taking @xmath14 to be the detector observable that is measured ( i.e.  the  output \" operator ) , one has to lowest order in @xmath11 : @xmath15 where the zero - frequency linear - response coefficient ( or  forward gain \" ) @xmath16 is given by @xmath17                  \\rangle_{\\rho_0 } \\\\          & = &          \\frac{2}{\\hbar } \\textrm{im } \\int^\\infty_{0 } d",

    "we have assumed that the qubit splitting frequency @xmath20 is much smaller than the rate which characterizes the detector , which allows us to approximate the detector s response to the qubit as instantaneous .",
    "alternatively , one can restrict attention to the case where the qubit is in a @xmath21 eigenstate , and thus @xmath22 is time independent .",
    "the operators on the rhs in the above equation evolve in the heisenberg picture generated by @xmath23 .",
    "next , we connect the detector noise in the output operator @xmath14 and input operator @xmath10 to , respectively , the measurement rate @xmath0 and the dephasing rate @xmath3 . defining the fluctuating part of an operator @xmath11 as @xmath24 , the required zero - frequency noise correlators are given by : [ corrs ] @xmath25 here , we use the short hand @xmath26 , where @xmath27,@xmath28 are eigenstates of @xmath29 with energies @xmath30 .",
    "the probability @xmath31 is defined as @xmath32 ; we assume that @xmath18 is diagonal in the basis of eigenstates . taking the detector noise to be gaussian ,",
    "the standard expressions for the dephasing rate @xmath3 and measurement rate @xmath0 are given by : @xcite @xmath33    we briefly review the origin of eqs .",
    "( [ rates ] ) .",
    "the dephasing rate describes the measurement - induced decay of the off - diagonal elements of the qubit density matrix .",
    "it can be derived by looking at the decay at long times of the phase correlator @xmath34 , where @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) is the spin raising ( lowering ) operator : @xmath37      \\big\\rangle \\label{firstdepheq } \\\\      & \\simeq & e^{-i \\widetilde{\\omega }   t } \\exp \\left (          \\frac{-2 a^2}{\\hbar^2 } \\int_0^t dt_1 \\int_0^t dt_2 \\langle          \\widetilde{q}(t_1 ) \\widetilde{q}(t_2 ) \\rangle \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\          & \\ra & e^{-i \\widetilde{\\omega } t }          e^{-\\gamma_{\\varphi } t}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath38 .",
    "the measurement rate describes how long the measurement must be on before the signal associated with the two qubit states can be distinguished from the noise in @xmath14 .",

    "( [ sispect])-([siq ] ) implicitly define an inner product ( i.e. , interpret the matrix elements @xmath51 and @xmath52 as defining vectors ) .",
    "the schwartz inequality then immediately yields : @xmath53 where we have introduced the reciprocal response coefficient ( or  backwards gain \" ) @xmath54 : @xmath55 @xmath54 would describes the response of @xmath56 to a perturbation which couples to the operator @xmath14 .",
    "note that as @xmath16 and @xmath54 are defined in terms of commutators , we may substitute @xmath57 , @xmath58 in their definitions .",

    "similar derivations of the quantum limit are presented in refs . and .    the inequality of eq .",
    "( [ finalineq ] ) is in many ways intuitively reasonable .",
    "both dephasing and measurement involve entangling the state of the qubit with states in the detector . in principle , there may be degrees of freedom in the detector which become entangled with the qubit _ without _ providing any detectable information in a measurement of @xmath61 ; any such entanglement would lead to @xmath62 .",
    "more precisely , imagine that when the measurement is initially turned on , the system is in a product state : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the initial state of the detector , and @xmath65,@xmath66 denote qubit @xmath21 eigenstates . at some later time",
    "@xmath67 , the state of the system may be written as : @xmath68 to say that we have measured the state of the system implies that the states @xmath69 and @xmath70 are distinguishable ; to say that the qubit has been dephased only implies that the detector states @xmath69 and @xmath71 are orthogonal .",
    "while distinguishability implies orthogonality , the opposite is not true ; thus , in general , @xmath72 .",
    "note that in this formulation , the dephasing rate will be related to the overlap between the two detector states : @xmath73      we have thus seen that on a heuristic level , reaching the quantum limit requires that the detector have no  extraneous \" degrees of freedom which couple to the qubit .",
    "equivalently , all information on the state of the qubit residing in the detector should be accessible in a measurement of @xmath61 .",
    "the virtue of the derivation presented in the last subsection is that these statements can be given a precise meaning .",
    "one sees that three conditions are necessary to reach the quantum limit : ( i ) the schwartz inequality of eq .",
    "( [ schwartzi ] ) must be optimized , ( ii ) the cross - correlator @xmath74 must vanish , and ( iii ) the backwards gain @xmath54 must vanish .",
    "conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) can be succinctly re - expressed as a single condition , leading to the following necessary and sufficient requirements : @xmath75 @xmath76 here , @xmath77 is a real number which is independent of the detector eigenstates @xmath78 and @xmath28 .",
    "( [ bigcondition ] ) and ( [ gaincondition ] ) are central results of this paper .",
    "the first of these equations expresses the fact that to reach the quantum limit , there must be a close similarity between the detector s input and output operators as far as the zero - frequency noise correlators are concerned , _ the operators @xmath14 and @xmath10 must be proportional to one another_. this required similarity between the detector input and output is a formal expression of the intuitive idea that a quantum limited detector has no  extraneous \" internal degrees of freedom . the second condition , eq .",
    "( [ gaincondition ] ) , expresses the fact that a quantum - limited detector must have a strong intrinsic directionality which discriminates between the input and output .",
    "the output operator is influenced by behaviour at the input , but not vice - versa .",
    "this requirement is consistent with our tacit assumption that the quantity @xmath61 can be measured without problems . to measure @xmath14",

    "this would clearly be sufficient to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ gaincondition ] ) .",
    "more generally , the vanishing of @xmath54 only requires the weaker condition of eq .",
    "( [ weakcausal ] ) .",
    "we close this section by formalizing the connection between the quantum limit and information .",
    "a deviation from the quantum limit ( i.e.  @xmath90 ) implies the existence in the detector of  missing information \" regarding the state of the qubit , information which is not revealed in a measurement of @xmath91 .",

    "we thus see that if the transmissions fluctuate , mode - mixing ( e.g.  the non - conservation of transverse energy ) also prevents one from reaching the quantum limit of detection .",

    "if the @xmath223 matrices are not purely diagonal , information about the qubit could be gained by looking at changes in how electrons incident in a given mode are partitioned into outgoing modes .",

    "note that the matrices @xmath216 and @xmath217 appearing in the polar decomposition of @xmath118 ( eq .  ( [ polar ] ) )",
    "are irrelevant to reaching the quantum limit .",
    "as each transverse mode is equally populated with incoming waves in the state @xmath27 , there is no information associated with the preferred mode structure for incoming waves ( i.e. the eigenvectors of @xmath216 and @xmath217 ) .",
