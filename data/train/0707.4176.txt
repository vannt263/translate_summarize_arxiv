    "one long - standing problem in the study of nuclear activity in galaxies is to understand how mass is transferred from galactic scales down to nuclear scales to feed the supermassive black hole ( hereafter smbh ) inside .",

    "nuclear spirals , in particular , are estimated to reside in more than half of active galaxies ( martini et al .",
    "martini & pogge ( 1999 ) have shown that nuclear spirals are not self - gravitating , and that they are likely to be shocks in nuclear gas disks .",
    "simulations by maciejewski ( 2004a , b ) demonstrated that , if a central smbh is present , spiral shocks can extend all the way to the smbh vicinity and generate gas inflow consistent with the accretion rates inferred in local agn .",
    "the above studies support the hypothesis that nuclear spirals are a mechanism for fueling the nuclear smbh , transporting gas from kiloparsec scales down to a few tens of parsecs of the active nucleus ( knapen et al .",

    "2006 ) in the specific case of the liner / seyfert 1 galaxy ngc1097 . using integral field spectroscopy at the gemini telescope we mapped the velocity field of the ionized gas and detected streaming motions towards the nucleus along nuclear spiral arms .",
    "ngc1097 is the only case so far in which streaming motions along nuclear spiral arms have been mapped . in order to verify",
    "if such spirals are always associated with inward streaming motions it is necessary to map the gas kinematics in more galaxies . with this goal in mind ,",
    "we have obtained gemini integral field spectroscopic observations of a few more active galaxies with nuclear spirals observed in hst images .",
    "the sample was selected from nearby galaxies ( z@xmath80.005 ) with intermediate inclinations , to facilitate study of the gas kinematics on linear distance scales of tens of parsecs .    in the present paper",
    "we report the results for ngc6951 , a galaxy with hubble type sab(rs)bc , at a distance of 24mpc ( tully 1988 ) , such that 1 arcsec corresponds to 96pc at the galaxy .",
    "originally it was argued that ngc6951 has a liner type nucleus ( filippenko & sargent 1985 ) , but more recently it has been suggested that actually its activity is intermediate between liner and seyfert ( prez et al .",
    "ngc6951 hosts a large scale bar ( with total extent of @xmath44kpc ) , and at about 5  ( 480pc ) from the nucleus , there is a conspicuous star - forming ring , previously observed in h@xmath0 ( mrquez & moles 1993 ; prez et al . 2000 ) and showing also strong co and hcn emission ( kohno et al . 1999 , garcia - burillo et al .",

    "continuum radio emission has also been observed from the nucleus and star - forming ring by saikia et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , while a higher resolution radio image can be found in ho & ulvestad ( 2001 ) .",
    "our ifu measurements show that , similarly to ngc1097 , the gas kinematics inside the nuclear ring of ngc6951 , although dominated by circular rotation , shows deviations in the measured radial velocities which can be interpreted as at least partially due to streaming inward motions along nuclear spiral arms .",
    "our results strenghten the case that nuclear spirals are indeed channels to feed the supermassive black hole in active galaxies .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the observations and reductions . in section 3",
    "we present the flux and kinematic measurements . in section 4",
    "we discuss the results and in section 5 we present our conclusions .",
    "the observations were obtained with the integral field unit of the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos - ifu , allington - smith et al .",
    "2002 ) at the gemini north telescope , on the nights of august 31 and september 1 , 2006 .",
    "the observations consisted of three adjacent ifu fields ( covering @xmath9 each ) resulting in a total angular coverage of @xmath10 around the nucleus .",
    "three exposures of 500s were obtained for each of the 3 ifu fields , slightly shifted in order to correct for detector defects .",
    "observations of the three ifu fields were obtained consecutively on the same night .",
    "the fluxes in adjacent ifu pixels from neighbouring fields were found to be consistent within 10% .",
    "therefore , no shifts or scaling were applied when combining the three fields to obtain the final mosaic .",
    "the longest extent of the three adjacent ifu fields was oriented along position angle ( hereafter pa ) 140@xmath11 , selected to approximately coincide with the major axis of the galaxy , ( pa=138  according to mrquez & moles 1993 ) , while the large scale bar is oriented approximately along e  w .",
    "each ifu fiber has a diameter which corresponds to 0.2  in the sky , while the seeing during the observations ranged between 0.4 and 0.5 , corresponding to a spatial resolution at the galaxy of @xmath1240pc .",
    "the selected wavelength range was 56007000 , in order to cover the h@xmath0+[nii]@xmath26548,84 and [ sii]@xmath26716,31 emission lines , observed with the grating gmos r400-g5325 ( set to central wavelength @xmath12 6300  ) , with an instrumental fwhm of 2.9 , corresponding to a spectral resolution of r@xmath13 ( @xmath14kms@xmath7 ) .",
    "the data reduction was performed using the specific tasks developed for gmos data in the gemini.gmos package as well as generic tasks in iraf .",
    "the reduction process comprised bias subtraction , flat - fielding , trimming , wavelength calibration , sky subtraction , relative flux calibration , building of the data cubes at a sampling of 0.1@xmath15@xmath30.1@xmath15 , and finally the alignment and combination of the 9 data cubes .",
    "as we have obtained only relative flux calibration ( what is called in gemini `` baseline calibrations '' ) , we have normalized the flux levels using the h@xmath0 nuclear flux reported by perez et al .",
    "in figure  [ image ] we show the acquisition image with the location of the three ifu fields , together with an image obtained from the ifu data in the continuum adjacent to the h@xmath0 emission - line .",

    "we show a sample of spectra : one from the nucleus , one from the star - forming ring and two from locations between the nucleus and the ring .",
    "the emission - lines present in most spectra are h@xmath0 , [ nii]@xmath26548,84 and [ sii]@xmath26717,31 .",
    "the lines [ oi]@xmath26300,63 were marginally detected only in a few spectra , and were not considered in our analysis due to the poor signal - to - noise ratio ( in these lines ) .",
    "the emission - line spectrum from the nucleus is liner - like ( [ nii]@xmath16584 stronger than h@xmath0 ) , as already known from previous works ( e.g. filippenko & sargent 1985 ) .",
    "more recently , ho , fillipenko & sargent ( 1997 ) have argued that the nuclear activity is better classified as seyfert 2 , after an analysis of the nuclear spectrum taking into account the effect of the underlying stellar absorption in the fluxes of the balmer lines .",
    "prez et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , after a similar analysis , conclude that the nuclear activity of ngc6951 is intermediate between liner and seyfert 2 .",
    "our data are consistent with all these classifications , as our restricted wavelength coverage does not allow the observation of additional line ratios necessary to distinguish between the different types of activity .",
    "the emission - line ratios in the star - forming ring are typical of hii regions , while in the regions between the nucleus and the ring , the line - ratios are also mostly liner - like , turning to `` hii - like '' as the star - forming ring is approached .",
    "the line fluxes , radial velocities and velocity dispersions were obtained by fitting gaussians to the emission - lines , which accurately represent the observed line profiles . the h@xmath0 image , obtained from the integrated h@xmath0 flux is shown in fig .  [ flux_ratios ] , together with the image in the adjacent continuum .",
    "most spectra have signal - to - noise ratios in the h@xmath0 and [ nii ] emission lines larger than 50 .",
    "the star - forming ring is clearly seen in the h@xmath0 image , formed by several hii regions which appear as emission - line knots along the ring .",
    "the ring is more extended along the major axis of the galaxy ( pa@xmath4140 ) , where it reaches @xmath12 4.5  from the nucleus ( 430pc at the galaxy ) , while in the perpendicular direction it reaches only @xmath12 2.5 .",

    "prior to the construction of the map [ nii]/h@xmath0 we have corrected the h@xmath0 line fluxes by an average underlying absorption due to the stellar population with an equivalenth width of 0.75 .",
    "this procedure is necessary in order to avoid unphysical very high ratios of [ nii]/h@xmath0 and is supported by the inspection of a few spectra which reveal that where h@xmath0 emission is very faint the line is indeed obviously filling an absorption .",
    "the average value of 0.75  was adopted from the work of prez et al .",
    "( 2000 ) who estimated an absorption equivalent width of h@xmath0 of 1  at the nucleus and 0.5  at the ring on the basis of the analysis of the stellar population .",
    "we thus decided to adopt an average value between that of the nucleus and that of the ring , as the resulting corrected fluxes did not change by more than @xmath420% at the nucleus and @xmath410% at the ring if we change the underlying absorption by 0.25 .",
    "the highest [ nii]/h@xmath0 line ratios reach values of 4 - 5 within a @xmath121  radius from the nucleus , decreasing to 2 - 3 between 1  and 2  and down to @xmath120.3 at the circumnuclear ring .",

    ", the low - density limit value of 1.4 ( @xmath8100@xmath17 ) is reached . in most locations between the nucleus and the ring , the signal - to - noise ratio was too low to get a reliable value for the [ sii ] ratio . in many location where it could be measured , it was in the low - density limit . in order to investigate this further",
    ", we have binned 9 spectra together ( which corresponds to 0.3@xmath30.3arcsec@xmath18 , and thus approximately to the angular resolution of the data ) in several locations and got ratios in the range 1.2@xmath8[sii]6717/6731@xmath81.4 , thus somewhat above the low - density limit , implying ionized gas densities of @xmath4100@xmath17 , which we will adopt as the typical value for this region .",
    "the central wavelengths of the gaussian curves fitted to the emission - lines were used to obtain the gas radial velocities , while the full widths at half maxima ( fwhm ) were used to obtain the gas velocity dispersions ( @xmath19fwhm/2.355 ) .",

    "there are , nevertheless , clear deviations from simple rotation in the radial velocity field . in order to isolate these deviations ,",
    "we have fitted an exponential thin disk kinematic model to the h@xmath0 radial velocity data , assuming that the density profile is exponential and its kinematics is circular rotation ( freeman 1970 ; binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "the procedure is similar to the one we have adopted in modelling the circumnuclear gas kinematics of ngc1097 ( fathi et al . 2005 ; fathi et al . 2006 ) .",

    "we have adopted a disk inclination of @xmath21 , a value derived from photometry ( mrquez & moles 1993 ) , because the inclination is not well constrained in our multi - parameter space fitting procedure .",
    "a comparison between the measured radial velocity field and the disk model reveals deviations from simple rotation .",
    "these deviations are observed along the star - forming ring as well as inside the ring , where , in particular , we have identified two features resembling partial spiral arms marked by two white curved lines with arrows in fig .",
    "[ radial_vel ] . in order to investigate",
    "if these deviations correspond to real features in the galaxy , we have constructed a structure map ( pogge & martini 2002 ) using an hst image of the nuclear region of ngc6951 obtained through the filter f606w ( hst proposal 8597 , pi m. regan ) .",
    "the structure map is useful to enhance the contrast in the images , thus showing more clearly both dark structures ",

    "the structure map is shown in the bottom left panel of fig .",
    "[ radial_vel ] , where we have drawn the same white lines of the top left panel , showing that the partial spiral arms follow the dusty spiral structure seen in the structure map .",
    "although there are more spiral arms in the structure map than the two we see in the velocity residual map , this difference can be understood as due to the poorer angular resolution of the ifu data ( @xmath120.4 ) compared to that of the hst ( 0.05 ) , which precludes us from establishing a more detailed correspondence . in the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ radial_vel ] we show the residuals between the observed and the model velocity field , where the white lines correspond again to the partial arm structures .",
    "the top arm ( hereafter called w arm ) corresponds to a blueshifted region in the residual map , while the bottom arm ( hereafter e arm ) corresponds to a redshifted region .",

    "the instrumental @xmath22 is @xmath1250kms@xmath7 , thus it can be concluded that many values , particularly for h@xmath0 , are at the resolution limit of the instrument .",
    "the low values obtained for h@xmath0 in some regions are due to the fact that , in the region between the nucleus and the star - forming ring h@xmath0 emission is strongly affected by the underlying stellar absorption ( discussed above ) , which makes the observed emission line weaker and narrower . on the other hand , the [ nii ] profile provides a reliable measure of @xmath22 because it is free of the contamination by stellar absorption .",

    ".    what could be the origin of these enhancements in @xmath22 ?",
    "our experience with previous ifu observations ( of other targets ; e.g. riffel et al . 2006 ; barbosa et al . 2007 ) , reveal that increases in @xmath22 in the gas surrounding agn are usually related to the presence of a passing radio jet .",

    "notice that the extent and orientation of this radio structure coincide with those of a bright similarly elongated nuclear structure seen in the structure map ( bottom left panel of fig.[radial_vel ] ) .",
    "as the f606w filter used to obtain the hst image includes h@xmath0 , this coincidence suggests that we are resolving enhanced h@xmath0 emission associated with the radio structure in this image .",

    "the presence of shocks in the vicinity of the nucleus is particularly evident in fig.[sigma ] , where we have shown that two regions which have the highest observed @xmath22 values are located at the ends of the nuclear radio structure , and can be interpreted as gas from the interstellar medium of the galaxy shocked by a radio jet .",

    "a possible interpretation is that we are seeing two parts of a spiral arm : a more external one , traced by h@xmath0 emission , and a more internal one , seen only in molecular gas emission , probably due to the absence  or faintness  of ionized gas emission .",
    "the rotation pattern in the h@xmath0 radial velocity field ( fig.[radial_vel ] ) shows that the se side of the galaxy is receding while the nw side is approaching . under the assumption that the spiral arms are trailing , and that the approaching side of the bar piles up the dust in front of it , it can be concluded that the near side of the galaxy is the sw , and the far side is the ne . the deviations from circular rotation along the two partial spiral arms in the inner 23  from the nucleus ",
    "blueshifted residuals along the w arm and redshifted residuals along the e arm  can thus be interpreted as streaming motions along nuclear spiral arms towards the nucleus .",
    "nevertheless , the residuals in this inner region extend beyond the region covered by the e and w arms drawn in fig.[radial_vel ] : in particular , there are additional blueshifts observed to the s  se of the nucleus and redshifts observed to the n  nw , which seem to be a continuation of the e and w arms .",
    "nevertheless , at @xmath41n  nw and s  se of the nucleus , they are not consistent with streaming motions towards the nucleus . we conclude that these residuals are in fact outflows due to the interaction of the radio source at the nucleus ( saikia et al .",
    "2002 ) with the circumnuclear ism of the galaxy .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the increase in the velocity dispersion of the gas from 70kms@xmath7 to 140kms@xmath7 along the position angle of the radio structure ( pa=156 ) , approximately within a region delineated by two white lines representing the borders of a bi - cone in fig.[sigma ] . from the location of this bi - cone in fig.[radial_vel ] , we conclude that the residual blueshifts at @xmath121n - nw and redshifts at @xmath121s - se of the nucleus are observed in the regions corresponding to those with enhanced @xmath22 and can be interpreted as outflows related to the radio source .",
    "the residuals from circular motion in the inner 3  thus include two components : ( 1 ) streaming motions towards the nucleus along spiral arms and ( 2 ) an outflow due to the interaction of a radio source with the circumnuclear ism of the galaxy . from the relative intensity of the continuum observed in the structure map in the location of the radio structure , which is brighter to the side to which the residuals are blueshifts , we suggest that the near side of the jet is projected against the near side of the galaxy , which is possible only if its angle relative to the galaxy plane is smaller than 48 , for the adopted inclination of the galaxy of 42 .    in the regions corresponding to the ring , there are also radial velocity residuals relative to the circular rotation which could be due to outflows from the starbursts along the ring and/or deviations due to the accumulation of the gas in the inner lindblad ressonance .",
    "the kinematics we have obtained for the nuclear region of ngc6951 can be compared with that obtained in previous works , in particular by p00 , who have studied the large scale kinematics from long - slit spectroscopy along three position angles ( over a radius of up to 100  from the nucleus ) : one along the photometric major axis ( 138 ) , one along the perpendicular direction ( 48 ) and one along pa=84 . on the basis of the kinematics along these three pas ,",

    "our data , with a complete 2d coverage , favors best the nuclear outflow hypothesis , but in combination with streaming motions along nuclear spirals .",
    "gb05 have used near - ir hst images of the nuclear region  where they found a stellar oval  in combination with the co observations , in order to estimate whether torques produced by the non - axisymmetric stellar potential would be efficient enough to drain the gas angular momentum allowing its inflow to the nuclear region .",
    "gb05 conclude that the inflow is efficient only down to the star forming ring , approximately . inside the ring ,",
    "the torques are positive and can not drive gas inflow . as molecular gas is observed much closer to the nucleus , gb05 conclude that , inside the ring , other mechanisms should be responsible to drive the agn fueling , such as viscous torques .",
    "englmaier & shlosman ( 2000 ) have used 2d numerical simulations to show that nuclear gaseous spirals are generated as as result of the gas response to the gravitational potential of a galactic disk with a large scale stellar bar .",
    "both ngc6951 and ngc1097 ( fathi et al .",
    "2006 ) present similar large scale stellar bars , which could thus play a role in the formation of the nuclear spirals .    more recently ,",
    "maciejewski ( 2004 ) has considered the effect of a smbh in nuclear gaseous spirals .",
    "the fact that the smbh does play a role is supported by the ubiquitous presence of nuclear spirals in seyfert galaxies ( martini & pogge 1999 ; pogge & martini 2002 ) , and , in particular , by the strong correlation of their presence with the nuclear activity ( lopes et al .",
    "maciejewski concludes that , if the asymmetry is strong , spiral shocks are produced , and the central smbh can allow the spiral shocks to extend all the way to its immediate vicinity , generating gas inflow of up to 0.03m@xmath6yr@xmath7 . the cases of ngc6951 presented here and ngc1097 presented by fathi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) seem to support the models of maciejewski ( 2004a , b ) .",
    "we can use the residual velocities observed along the nuclear spiral to estimate the rate of mass flowing to the nucleus . in order to do that ,",
    "we assume that the mass flows along two nuclear spiral arms .",
    "the cross section of these arms can be estimated assuming an opening angle of 20  subtended by the spiral arms at 100pc from the nucleus .",
    "this opening angle corresponds to a radius for an assumed circular cross section of the spiral arm calculated as :    @xmath35     + the flux of matter crossing the circular cross section can be calculated as : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the electron density , @xmath38 is the streaming velocity of the gas towards the nucleus , @xmath39 is the number of spiral arms , @xmath40 is the mass of the proton , and @xmath41 is the filling factor .",
    "the filling factor was estimated from :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the h@xmath0 luminosity emitted by a volume @xmath44 and @xmath453.534@xmath46erg@xmath17s@xmath7 ( osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "in the region covered by the partial spiral arms we obtain an average flux per pixel ( of angular size 0.1@xmath30.1 ) of 4.8@xmath47erg@xmath48s@xmath7 . in order to calculate the h@xmath0 luminosity in the region covered by a partial arm",
    ", we adopt an area of 2@xmath31 which corresponds to 200 pixels .",

    ", we obtain @xmath550.004 .",
    "the velocity residuals in the region of the partial nuclear arms , which we have interpreted as streaming motions , range from @xmath1220kms@xmath7 to @xmath1250kms@xmath7 ( fig.[radial_vel ] ) . assuming that these streaming motions occur in the plane of the galaxy , we need to correct these values for the inclination of the galaxy @xmath21 .",
    "the resulting average velocity for the streaming motions is @xmath56=40kms@xmath7 . for @xmath57@xmath17 ( fig.[flux_ratios ] ) ,",
    "@xmath58kms@xmath7 and @xmath59 , we obtain the value for the flux of matter along the nuclear spirals of @xmath60gs@xmath7@xmath30.004@xmath128@xmath61m@xmath62yr@xmath7 .",
    "we note that the above calculation is only a rough estimate , as it depends on uncertain parameters , such as the geometry of the flow . under the assumption that the gas moving along the spiral is reaching the nucleus",
    ", we can compare the above calculated rate of ionized gas flow to the accretion rate necessary to reproduce the luminosity of the liner nucleus of ngc6951 , calculated as follows .",
    "the nuclear luminosity can be estimated from the h@xmath0 luminosity of l(h@xmath0)@xmath63ergs@xmath7 ( from the nuclear flux and reddening quoted by p00 ) using the approximation that the bolometric luminosity is @xmath64 100@xmath65(h@xmath66ergs@xmath7 ( ho 1999 ; ho et al .",
    "this estimate is consistent also with the upper limit on the x - ray luminosity of this galaxy , @xmath67ergs@xmath7 ( fabbiano et al .",
    "1992 ; ho 1999 ) .",
    "the mass accretion rate can then be estimated as :    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the efficiency of conversion of the rest mass energy of the accreted material into radiation . for a `` standard '' geometrically thin , optically thick accretion disk , @xmath700.1 ( e.g. frank et al .",
    "2002 ) , but for liners it has been concluded that the accretion disk is geometrically thick , and optically thin ( ho 2005 ; nemmen et al .",
    "2006 , yuan 2007 ) .",
    "this kind of accretion flow is known as riaf ( radiatively inefficient accretion flow ; narayan 2005 ) , and has a typical value for @xmath700.01 .",
    "we use this value to derive an accretion rate of @xmath71gs@xmath7 , or 2.8@xmath72m@xmath73yr@xmath7 . comparing this accretion rate @xmath74 with the mass flow of ionized gas along the nuclear spirals derived above @xmath75",
    ", we conclude that @xmath76 3@xmath74 .",
    "thus the flow of ionized gas along the spiral arms is of the order of the one necessary to feed the agn in ngc6951 .",
    "we should nevertheless point out that this flow is most probably a lower limit to the actual inward flow of matter , as we are observing only the ionized gas , which may be just the `` tip of the iceberg '' .",
    "neutral and molecular gas may also be flowing in , as suggested by the @xmath7710@xmath78m@xmath6 of molecular gas mass detected at the nucleus by gb05 and krips et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "we now compare the above results obtained for ngc6951 with those obtained for ngc1097 .",
    "storchi - bergmann ( 2007 ) has calculated the mass flow rate along the nuclear spirals of ngc1097 on the basis of similar ifu observations , but for a filling factor f=1 . if we adopt a more realistic value of @xmath4 10@xmath79 , it can be concluded that the mass flow rate of ionized gas is again similar to the accretion rate necessary to power the liner nucleus of ngc1097 .",
    "similarly to the case of ngc6951 , the total mass flow is probably larger , and could include neutral and molecular gas",
    ". a larger mass flow rate would be consistent with the presence of a young starburst ( age@xmath410@xmath80yr ) with mass 10@xmath80m@xmath62 discovered in the nuclear hst - stis uv nuclear spectrum of ngc1097 and estimated to be closer than 9pc from the nucleus ( storchi - bergmann et al .",
    "the gas flowing to the nuclear region is thus not only feeding the nucleus but has also accumulated enough mass to give origin to a circumnuclear starburst in the last 10@xmath80yrs .",
    "the association of recent star - formation with nuclear activity has been claimed in many recent studies ( e.g. cid fernandes et al .",
    "2001 , storchi - bergmann et al . 2001 ) and its association in particular with dust structures in early - type galaxies has been also supported by the recent work of ferrarese et al .",
    "we have presented ifu - gmos observations of the ionized gas in the inner region of the galaxy ngc6951 which evidence the presence of streaming motions along nuclear spiral arms towards its liner nucleus .",
    "the streaming motions are observed over an extent of @xmath12200pc along two partial spiral arms down to @xmath12100pc from the nucleus .",
    "this is so far only the second galaxy in which such streaming motions have been mapped , the first being ngc1097 also by our group ( fathi et al .",
    "the relevance of this result stems from the fact that the presence of dusty nuclear structures correlates strongly with nuclear activity ( lopes et al .",
    "2007 ) , what suggests that these structures are associated with the actual fuel on its way in to feed the nuclear smbh .",
    "nevertheless , until recently , there were no kinematic measurements which showed that these spirals do carry gas inwards .",
    "such kinematic measurements are difficult to obtain due to the fact that the gas kinematics of the nuclear region of active galaxies is usually dominated by outflows from the narrow - line region .",
    "most kinematic studies do reveal outflows and no inflows ( e.g. crenshaw & kraemer 2007 and references therein ) .    in order to observe colder gas that can fall inwards",
    "it is necessary to obtain gas kinematics around nuclei with low levels of activity , such that the outflows are small , if present .",
    "this seems to be the case of ngc6951 : a liner nucleus , with a small jet , such that it was possible to disentangle the outlow related to the jet from streaming motions along nuclear spirals .",
    "additional observational constraints to observe such motions around a galaxy nucleus include a favorable orientation of the galaxy to allow the measurement of the kinematics and strong enough gas emission to allow such measurements up to several hundred parsecs from the nucleus , so that we can constrain the disk rotation and on top of it measure the residuals from circular motion .    with the present results for ngc6951 we can now say that there are two galaxies with confirmed inward streaming motions along nuclear spirals  ngc1097 and ngc6951  giving strong support to the hypothesis that these spirals are indeed channels through which the matter flows inwards to feed the smbh .",
    "the kinematic measurements and an estimated geometry derived from the observations has allowed us to estimate the ionized gas mass flow rate along the nuclear spirals of ngc1097 and ngc6951 .",
    "we obtain values which are similar to the accretion rate necessary to power the agn .",
    "the total mass flow rate is most probably larger , including neutral and molecular gas . in the case of ngc6951 ,",
    "molecular gas has been recently observed both at the star forming ring and inside the ring . in the case of ngc1097 , the young nuclear starburst found by storchi - bergmann et al .",
    "( 2005 ) supports also a larger flow of matter to the nucleus in the last 10@xmath80yrs .",
    "thus it may be that the inflows observed along nuclear spiral arms not only feed nuclear smbh but at the same time contribute to the growth of the bulge via star formation . as a result ,",
    "both the stellar component of the galaxy and its smbh at the nucleus grow after each activity cycle , in agreement with the scenario implied by the m@xmath81 relation ( e.g. tremaine et al .",
