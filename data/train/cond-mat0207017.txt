    "during the past two decades , considerable attention has been focused on heavy - fermion ( hf ) systems.@xcite generally speaking , hf systems are a class of intermetallic compounds which contain a periodic array of magnetic kondo ions , involving rare earth ( 4@xmath0 ) or actinide ( 5@xmath0 ) elements . at higher temperatures than the kondo temperature @xmath1 , the localized magnetic moments behave essentially as independent impurities and each @xmath0 electron becomes the scattering center in the kondo effect . in this temperature region , the characters of the @xmath0 electrons are similar to those in dilute alloys . at low temperatures , the coherent heavy fermion ( or fermi liquid ) behaviors",
    "are observed , the @xmath0 electrons form a coherent kondo lattice .",
    "the specific - heat coefficient @xmath2 is of order @xmath3 larger than that of normal metals , and the density of states near fermi level , deduced from @xmath2 , is enhanced enormously .",
    "it is widely accepted that the large specific - heat coefficient is caused by kondo effect at each kondo ion site.@xcite    from the ensuing experimental and theoretical works , it is clear that hfmaterials such as ceal@xmath4,@xcite cecu@xmath5,@xcite ube@xmath6,@xcite and cecu@xmath7si@xmath7,@xcite display many of the characteristics of metallic kondo lattice ( kl ) , where a lattice of localized magnetic moments coexists with a conduction band.@xcite instead of a kondo resonance ( single - peak ) structure in the impurity case , the density of states of @xmath0 electrons ( @xmath0-dos ) has a pseudogap ( two - peak ) structure near fermi level in the kl case , due to the periodic coherence between kondo ions in the lattice . in order to get information on the development of coherence in hf systems ,",
    "many experiments have been performed to study the alloying effects in doped hf systems , such as ce@xmath8la@xmath9cu@xmath7si@xmath7,@xcite ce@xmath8la@xmath9al@xmath4,@xcite ce@xmath8la@xmath9be@xmath6,@xcite ce@xmath8la@xmath9cu@xmath5,@xcite and so on .",
    "it is shown that , with the increasing of the concentration of kondo ions ( ce - like ions ) , an hf alloy system undergoes a crossover from kondo impurity state to kl state . that is , doping kondo ions presents a consecutive approach to the coherent kondo state efficiently .",
    "meanwhile , the electrical resistivity @xmath10 follows the quadratic law on temperature @xmath11 in kl case , which is one of the characteristic features of coherence , corresponding to the fermi liquid behavior .",
    "additionally , a shift of the peak in the specific - heat coefficient @xmath2 is observed to finite temperature with increasing of the concentration @xmath12,@xcite while the kondo temperature @xmath1 is independent of @xmath12 from experiments.@xcite theoretically , a dispersion term of @xmath0 electron band is introduced to the anderson lattice model ( alm ) by yoshimori and kasai to get a metallic kl system in the case of half - filling.@xcite under the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) , they calculate the electrical resistivity of hf alloys , and some excellent results are obtained , in agreement with experiments very well .",
    "furthermore , li and qiu@xcite extent the method of yoshimori and kasai , and tried to present a reasonable picture for heavy - fermion alloys by the application of the slave - boson mean - field approximation .",
    "they calculated the density of states , the thermoelectric power , the specific - heat coefficient , and the residual resistivity .",
    "the results themselves look meaningful and the obtained kondo temperature @xmath1 is indeed independent of the alloy concentration . while the slave - boson parameter has not been calculated out over the whole range of the concentration @xmath13 , their results seem artificial and more careful study is necessary to be performed even for the alloying effects of hf systems .    on the other hand , it is also possible to study systematically the development of the hf behaviors through the application of pressure . from the pressure - dependent measurements on ceal@xmath4,@xcite cecu@xmath5,@xcite ube@xmath6,@xcite ceincu@xmath7,@xcite ybcu@xmath7si@xmath7,@xcite ybcual,@xcite etc .",
    ", it is clear that , for ce - based and u - based hf systems , the specific - heat coefficient is depressed and the temperature @xmath14 , at which the electronic resistivity gets the maximum , shifts to higher temperature under pressure .",
    "furthermore , pressure tends to expand the temperature region of the quadratic law and to enhance the coherence of the system .",
    "while for yb - based hf systems , just the opposite effects appear under pressure .",
    "more generally , pressure qualitatively acts as a _ mirror _ between ce - based , u - based compounds and yb - based compounds.@xcite from experiments , pressure destabilizes the larger ion . in the case of @xmath0 electron systems , pressure will stabilize the @xmath15 configuration relative to @xmath16.@xcite for ce - based compounds , the nonmagnetic @xmath17 configuration would be favored rather than @xmath18 under pressure.@xcite while for yb - based compounds , the magnetic @xmath19 configuration would be favored under pressure rather than @xmath20.@xcite moreover , pressure tends to induce a crossover from a localized @xmath0-electron states to an itinerant or coherent one for ce - based compounds,@xcite and the opposing effect is also expected for yb - based compounds.@xcite although these important results stated above have been obtained from experiments for a long time , to the best of our knowledge , few works have been performed for the pressure effects on the hf systems theoretically . among various possible approaches to study the pressure effects ,",
    "the kondo collapse ( kc ) is considered as a reasonable mechanism .",
    "it can be used to explain such fact that the hybridization @xmath21 is very exponentially sensitive to pressure .",
    "but the kc theory also indicates that the volume decrease results in a large increase in the kondo temperature.@xcite it is true for the ce - based@xcite and u - based@xcite compounds , but not true for the yb - based compounds where the volume decrease results in a decrease in the kondo temperature.@xcite so such a mechanism , the kc , is still controversial , and it seems not so efficient to think that the mirror effect between ce - based , u - based compounds and yb - based compounds can be explained within the framework of the kc .",
    "the essential of the problem is how pressure influences the development of coherence , in which the system displays typical hf features .",
    "taking into account the valence fluctuation of @xmath0 ions between the singlet and magnetic multiplet configurations , the pressure - dependent behaviors may arise from the cell - volume difference between @xmath0 configurations .",
    "pressure favors the @xmath0 configuration with a smaller volume.@xcite on this basis , we would like to develop a theory of pressure on hf alloys involving effects of doping and effects of pressure simultaneously . following li and qiu,@xcite the alloying effects of hf systems",
    "are studied within the yoshimori - kasai ( yk ) model by using the slave - boson mean - field approximation ( sbmfa ) , but the main results are calcultated again over the whole range of the concentration @xmath13 carefully in order to promote the credit of the method . the aim of the paper is to present a unified picture of pressure effects for both ce - based , u - based and yb - based systems .",
    "the rest of the paper is prepared as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we formulate the disorder scattering within the mean - field approximation of yk model and introduce the volume variable to describe the pressure influence via the @xmath0 valence fluctuation , originating from the hybridization between @xmath0 electrons and conduction electrons ( @xmath22 electrons )",
    ". then the spectral function of single - particle green s function ( gf ) is obtained using cpa method and a set of self - consistent equations is also addressed .",
    "based on these , the @xmath0-dos is performed numerically in sec .",
    "iii , while the specific - heat coefficient and the electrical resistivity are discussed in detail in sec .",
    "iv , where we attempt to explain and compare the contrasting effects of pressure on ce - based , u - based and yb - based systems in a unified theory .",
    "finally , our results are summarized and discussed in sec .",
    "in the alloy systems such as ce@xmath8la@xmath9cu@xmath7si@xmath7 , and ce@xmath8la@xmath23al@xmath4 , there exists two kinds of rare earth atoms @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath24 ( ce - like ) is a magnetic atom with @xmath0 electrons and @xmath25 ( la - like ) a nonmagnetic atom without @xmath0 electrons .",

    "the coefficient @xmath24 ( fig . 7 ) and the temperature @xmath14 ( fig .",
    "8) are strongly affected by the application of pressure . for the @xmath67-type hf systems ,",
    "pressure increases the temperature @xmath14 but decreases the coefficient @xmath24 and expands the temperature region in which the quadratic law appears . because the larger presence of the quadratic term in the temperature dependence of the resistivity accompanies the stronger coherence ,",
    "these results indicate that pressure studies on the @xmath67-type hf systems provide a means of tuning the onset of kondo coherence into the experimental temperature range without the introduction of disorder which accompanies doping.@xcite for the @xmath68-type hf systems , pressure decreases @xmath14 but increases the coefficient @xmath24 and shrinks the temperature range for the quadratic law .",
    "again , pressure acts as a mirror and leads to the contrasting effects on resistivity between the @xmath67-type hf systems as ube@xmath6,@xcite cecu@xmath5,@xcite cecu@xmath7si@xmath7,@xcite ceal@xmath174,@xcite and ceincu@xmath7,@xcite and the @xmath68-type hf systems as ybagcu@xmath171,@xcite ybcual,@xcite and ybcu@xmath7si@xmath7.@xcite",
    "in this paper , the pressure effects on hf alloys are studied by the application of cpa in the framework of yoshimori - kasai ( yk ) model . following li and qiu ,",
    "the alloying effects of hf systems are studied by using the sbmfa .",
    "the density of states of @xmath0 electrons ( @xmath0-dos ) , the kondo temperature @xmath1 , the specific - heat coefficient @xmath2 , and the electrical resistivity @xmath10 are obtained in our cpa formalism for both the @xmath67-type hf alloys and the @xmath68-type hf alloys .",
    "it is found that with the increasing of the @xmath0 ion concentration , as pointed out by li and qiu,@xcite the system transforms from a kondo impurity with single - peak structure into a coherent kondo lattice ( kl ) with two - peak pseudogap structure . accompanying this transformation",
    ", a peak appears in the specific - heat coefficient @xmath2 , and it shifts to higher temperature by increasing doping . on the other hand , pressure tends to enhance the itinerance and coherence of the system in the @xmath67-type hf alloys , while , to support the localization and the incoherent state in the @xmath68-type hf alloys .",
    "the application of pressure increases the kondo temperature and suppresses the specific - heat coefficient for the @xmath67-type hf systems . accompanying these effects",
    ", pressure increases the temperature @xmath14 and expands the temperature region for the quadratic law .",
    "conversely , pressure decreases the kondo temperature , enhances the specific - heat coefficient and shrinks the temperature interval for the quadratic law in the @xmath68-type case .",
    "our theoretical results on the hf systems can be looked as a unified interpretation on the opposite pressure - dependent effects , observed in ube@xmath175 , cecu@xmath5 , cecu@xmath7si@xmath7 , ceal@xmath4 , and ceincu@xmath7 ( the @xmath67-type hf systems ) and ybagcu@xmath171 , ybcual , and ybcu@xmath7si@xmath7 ( the @xmath68-type hf systems ) .",
    "although , it is widely accepted that pressure acts qualitatively as a mirror between ce - based , u - based compounds and yb - based compounds,@xcite further experiments are required to determine to what intensity and to what extent the @xmath68-type hf systems are mirror images of their @xmath67-type counterparts .",
