    "the heavy - ion collision program aims to identify and characterize the properties of deconfined quark matter at high temperatures .",
    "many valuable probes of the properties of the medium produced in a heavy - ion collision are available , which include jets , electromagnetic signals and heavy quarkonia states ( @xmath4 )  @xcite .",
    "in particular much work has been devoted to understand how the presence of deconfined quarks and gluons may affect the binding of quarkonia  @xcite .",
    "the analyses of the binding energies of mesonic states as a function of the temperature have been carried out by various authors using potential models , with interaction potentials extracted from lattice qcd calculations  @xcite .",
    "these analyses show that quarkonia dissociate at temperatures close to the critical temperature of qcd , @xmath5 .",
    "analogous results have been obtained by studying the correlation functions of charmonia above deconfinement  @xcite .    in the present study",
    "@xcite we are interested in determining how the decay widths for the leptonic , hadronic and radiative channels are influenced by the presence of the thermal medium . in order to determine the decay widths we first evaluate the radial wave function of the pertinent charmonia states employing the non - relativistic scrhdinger equation ( and for comparison the relativistic salpeter equation ) with interaction potential extracted from thermal lattice qcd simulations .",
    "the remarkable result of our analysis is that some decay widths change drastically close to @xmath5 . in the transition region",
    "we find that the decay widths of the @xmath1 that depend on the value of the wave function at the origin change by approximately a factor @xmath6 with respect to the corresponding values in vacuum .",
    "we also investigate the properties of the @xmath7 meson and in particular of the @xmath8 transition .",
    "this radiative decay contributes to the total inclusive @xmath1 production by a fraction of about @xmath9 , as determined in proton proton and @xmath10 @xmath11 data  @xcite .",
    "we find that this @xmath1 production mechanism is enhanced close to the critical temperature by approximately a factor @xmath3 with respect to the value in vacuum .",
    "potential models have been quite successful in describing the properties of heavy quark bound states in vacuum ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "our key assumption is that at any temperature @xmath12 , the interaction between heavy quarks can be approximated by an instantaneous potential , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the radial coordinate .",
    "we shall study bound states of heavy quarks by using the non relativistic schrdinger equation @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the constituent mass of the heavy quark ; @xmath17 and @xmath18 represent the wave function and the mass of the corresponding @xmath19 state , respectively . comparing the results of this analysis with those obtained using the salpeter equation for the @xmath20wave states @xmath21 we find excellent agreement between the outcomes of the two methods , meaning that for these mesonic states relativistic corrections are small .",
    "there are some controversies about how to extract the potential @xmath22 from the color - singlet free - energy @xmath23 ( see @xcite ) . in principle",
    ", the internal energy @xmath24 is obtained subtracting the entropy contribution from the free - energy @xmath25    however , this subtraction procedure has been put to question , one of the reasons being that around the critical temperature , the potential @xmath24 is more attractive than the potential at zero temperature .",
    "one possible interpretation of this result is that at non - vanishing temperatures there can be additional interactions between the two static quarks  @xcite . below @xmath5",
    "this effect should be due to hadrons and could be related to the string  flip - flop \" interaction  @xcite ; above @xmath5 it should be related to the antiscreening properties of qcd . in the following and in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite we shall use the internal energy in eq .",
    "( [ u1 ] ) as the interaction potential and show the results obtained using the free - energy only for comparison .",
    "as we shall see , using @xmath24 , we obtain dissociation temperatures for charmonia consistent with lattice results obtained with the maximum entropy method  @xcite . employing the free - energy as",
    "interaction potential gives much smaller dissociation temperatures .",
    "we shall consider the free - energy proposed in  @xcite employing the formalism of the debye - hckel theory , with the parameterization of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath26-\\frac{\\alpha}{r}(\\exp(-x)+x ) \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the modified bessel function , @xmath28 , while the functions @xmath29 and @xmath30 are determined by fitting the lattice data .",
    "once these two functions are fixed , this parameterization of the free - energy is in excellent agreement with lattice data for @xmath31 . at short distances",
    "the static quark - antiquark free - energy is normalized in such a way that it reproduces the free - energy at zero temperature @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the string tension and @xmath34 is the coulomb coupling constant .",
    "the values of these two parameters can be phenomenologically fixed ; we shall take @xmath35 gev@xmath36 , @xmath37 and with @xmath38 gev one obtains @xmath39 gev and @xmath40 gev .",
    "in order to determine the decay widths it is necessary to compute the wave function and the mass of the charmonia states . for @xmath41 states , they are determined solving both the schrdinger equation and the salpeter equation through the multhopp method while for @xmath42wave states we only solve the schrdinger equation .",
    "we have considered various decay processes .",
    "annihilation processes of charmonia can be viewed as two - stage factorized processes .",
    "the first process consists in @xmath43 annihilation into gauge bosons .",
    "the annihilation takes place at the characteristic distance @xmath14 of order @xmath44 , so for a non - relativistic pair @xmath45 and the annihilation amplitude is proportional to the wave function at the origin .",
    "then , the produced gauge boson decays or fragments into leptons and hadrons . in vacuum",
    "it is assumed that the inclusive probability of the latter process is equal to one . at finite temperature",
    "we assume that such a factorization persists .",
    "therefore , the width of hadronic and leptonic decays will depend on temperature exclusively through the radial wave function at the origin and the mass of the meson  @xcite and can be expressed as @xmath46 we also consider the radiative transitions @xmath8 from the @xmath47 levels to the @xmath48 state with rate @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the overlap integral between the radial wave functions of the corresponding states .        using the free - energy as interaction potential , the @xmath51 dissociates at temperatures close to @xmath52 , while the @xmath7 dissociate at about @xmath53 . using the internal energy as potential",
    "we find that the @xmath51 dissociates at approximately @xmath54 , while the @xmath7 dissociates at about @xmath55 . using the internal energy one obtains higher dissociation temperatures in agreement with the fact that @xmath56 is more attractive than @xmath57 . in fig .",
    "[ jpsi - origin ] we report the values of the decay width for the process in eq .",
    "( [ width1 ] ) , left panel , and for the process in eq .",
    "( [ width2 ] ) , right panel , as a function of the temperature . employing @xmath57 one",
    "finds a monotonic decrease of the width that can be viewed as due to a decrease of the screening length of the potential . on the other hand , when using @xmath56 we find that across the transition region both decay widths become large . for the decays in eq .",
    "( [ width1 ] ) the width is about a factor @xmath6 larger than in vacuum . for the radiative decay in eq .",
    "( [ width2 ] ) , the ratio between the width in the thermal medium and in vacuum reaches a factor @xmath3 across the transition region .",
    "this effect is not due to the screening of the potential , but is rather connected with the  cloud - cloud \" interaction  @xcite .    in order to have a rough estimate of the effect ,",
    "let us suppose that the @xmath7 is produced in the early stage of the heavy - ion collision and then travels for about @xmath58 fm in the thermally equilibrated medium",
    ". if the temperature is sufficiently low , so that the decay width is approximately the same as in vacuum , one has that less than @xmath59 of @xmath7 decay . on the other hand , for temperatures close to @xmath60",
    ", one should observe that about @xmath61 of @xmath7 decay .",
    "since for temperatures close to @xmath5 one can neglect interactions of charmonia with in - medium hadrons and gluons  @xcite the radiative decay process should give a sizable contribution to the total decay width of the @xmath7 .",
    "as regard the inclusive width of the @xmath1 , one should consider that at temperatures below @xmath5 , the process in eq .",
    "( [ width1 ] ) gives approximately the inclusive width .",
    "however , at larger temperatures the dominant contribution should be due to the interaction with in - medium partons  @xcite .",
    "the largest uncertainty in our calculations resides in the extraction of the potential from lattice qcd calculations and pertinent parametrizations to numerically evaluate the entropy . in order to test the robustness of our results",
    "one can employ a different parametrizations of the internal energy . using the expression of @xmath62 reported in ref .",
    "@xcite we find approximately the same results reported here .",
    "the analysis reported here can easily be extended to bottomia , moreover it would be of some interest to include @xmath63-mesons .",
