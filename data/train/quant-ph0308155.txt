    "investigation of the nonlinear medium response to coherent radiation is a powerful tool to analyze microscopic properties of matter and ultrafast processes taking place therein .",
    "moreover , detailed study of resonant light - matter interaction enables the development of new techniques of active control of processes under investigation .",
    "optically dense media attract significant attention , since they provide information about phenomena taking place in macroscopic ensembles of resonant particles . on the other hand ,",
    "a dense medium represents a rather complicated object , because it can strongly modify characteristics of probing radiation by coherent absorption and reemission of photons .",
    "these processes lead to appearance of the medium reaction field , which plays an essential role and becomes comparable to the field of an external radiation source . thus , the coupled electromagnetic field and optically dense matter should be considered self - consistently as a single system with specific characteristics and evolution .    in the limit , where the reemission field is negligible in comparison to the strong , externally applied one , the model of single driven - atom",
    "is usually used .",
    "atomic variables can be calculated on the basis of bloch equations without taking into account maxwell equations .",
    "thus , the spectral features of the process are fully determined by the strong external field , but not by the density of the medium . in this context ,",
    "phenomena such as rabi - sideband generation due to the stationary probe - pump mollow - boyd effect @xcite or to transient rabi flopping @xcite can be mentioned .",
    "the main peculiarity of the coherent interaction between light and optically dense media is related to collective behavior of resonant particles due to their interaction through the reemission field .",
    "this behavior can significantly modify the mutual light - matter dynamics , which can not be described in the framework of the single - atom model . in the case , where the high density of resonant medium enables the atomic system to coherently absorb and reradiate a considerable part of the energy of the external electromagnetic field , the fast excitation interchanges between field and matter appear , which is analogous to polariton beats in the solid - state optics .",
    "the frequency of such collective oscillations is determined by the density - dependent field - matter coupling coefficient and exceeds the relaxation rates of a medium . under the cavity interaction , this `` strong - coupling regime '' results in vacuum rabi - oscillations @xcite . in the field of cavity qed , nonclassical properties of the strong - coupling regime ( photon antibunching and sub - poissonian statistics @xcite , squeezing @xcite , and application for entanglement @xcite )",
    "have been discussed . under the free - space pulse propagation",
    ", the strong - coupling regime leads to the formation of the collective optical ringing @xcite .",
    "the generation of such a signal may appear even under the weak - field excitation , without essential changes in the population difference of a medium .",
    "this fact is different from the case of the resonant pulse breakup into @xmath0 solitons of self - induced transparency @xcite , where the incident pulse is strong enough to invert a part of a medium ( the area of the external field should be at least greater than @xmath1 ) . in this context ,",
    "the optical ringing represents a nonsolitonic solution in the form of a @xmath2 pulse .    in this paper",
    ", we present a study of coherent free - space interaction between two ( probe and pump ) short laser pulses propagating in a two - level extended medium under the conditions of the strong - coupling regime .",
    "we center our discussion on the question , how the collective oscillatory response of an optically dense medium , excited by a short pump pulse , affects the transmission spectrum of the probe field .",
    "since the optical ringing originates from the linear response of a dense resonant medium , we consider the case of a weak pump field , which does not invert atoms .",
    "hence , all obtained transformations of the probe pulse , particularly its amplification , take place in a medium without population inversion .",
    "the optical ringing represents an essentially transient phenomenon and can be observed in a time scale shorter than the relaxation times of a medium . due to its general character",
    ", such oscillating response accompanies a variety of coherent phenomena taking place under the short pulse propagation @xcite in dense media , and should be taken into account in analysis of experimental data . having a superradiant character , it was studied in the contexts of the so - called `` polarium model '' @xcite and oscillatory regime of dicke superradiance @xcite .",
    "its influence on the quantum coherent control and pulse shaping techniques was mentioned in refs .",
    "the works @xcite were devoted to the determination of relaxation times of homogeneously and inhomogeneously broadened spectral lines of molecular substances in the presence of the optical ringing . in refs .",
    "@xcite , different aspects of the coherent interaction of ultrashort laser pulses with extended multilevel atomic media , particularly two - photon absorption , were considered .",
    "the existence of ultrafast collective oscillations were demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , where not only the external laser pulse , but also the optical ringing itself belonged to the femtosecond time scale .    besides the atomic and molecular media ,",
    "the optical ringing was also rediscovered for the case of solid state exciton - polaritons @xcite .",
    "it was treated as quantum beats between two branches of polariton dispersion curve corresponding to a single medium resonance , contrasting to the case of usual quantum beats between different optical transitions .",
    "moreover , the transition from the strong - field regime of rabi flopping to the weak - field optical ringing under the strong - coupling regime was recently observed in ref .",
    "the femtosecond ringing was obtained for the cases of both bulk crystals @xcite and multiple quantum well structures @xcite .    in the presence of the optical ringing , the interaction of two intersected probe and pump beams ( this configuration is also used in the present work )",
    "was considered for the cases of atomic media @xcite and solids @xcite .",
    "most of the results of these studies are related to the time - integrated and time - resolved properties of the diffracted four - wave mixing signal .",
    "in contrast , our discussion is centered on the modification of the probe field , and particularly , on its spectral properties . in our previous works @xcite , we have studied both theoretically and experimentally interaction of broadband polychromatic pulses of a multimode dye - laser without mode locking in an optically dense resonant medium ( metastable neon atoms in gas discharges ) .",
    "different spectral types of probe amplification were obtained and analyzed .",
    "our present paper is devoted to the interaction of short transform - limited pulses , since fundamentals of the phenomena have been considered arise from the coherent interaction between short pulses and a dense medium .",

    "ii , the main equations of the theoretical model are obtained . in sec .",
    "iii , we outline some specific features of the collective optical ringing originating from the dispersion of a dense resonant medium . the numerical results and discussion of the probe - field propagation in the presence of a pump pulse are presented in sec .",
    "main results of the paper are summarized in sec .  v.",
    "the theory of transient processes of interaction between electromagnetic field and resonant media is based on the joint solution of the semiclassical maxwell - bloch equations @xcite .",
    "we restrict our study to the two - level system approximation assuming that interaction between the field and neighboring atomic transitions is negligibly small .",
    "the electric field @xmath3 and the polarization of the medium @xmath4 can be written in the form    @xmath5    introducing the complex amplitudes @xmath6 and @xmath7 slowly varying in time but having arbitrary spatial dependence . here , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the electric dipole moment and the resonance frequency of the atomic transition , @xmath10 is the density of atoms .",
    "the amplitude @xmath6 is expressed in the units of the rabi frequency of the electric field .    using the rotating wave approximation ,",
    "the system of bloch equations can be written as    [ 1 ] @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the population difference of an atom , @xmath13 is the value of @xmath12 in the absence of external field ( the value @xmath14 corresponds to an atom in the ground state ) , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the relaxation rates .    the problem of the interaction between two intersected plane linearly polarized waves is considered . in the case of nearly copropagating pulses , the amplitude of the field is given by    @xmath17    with @xmath18 and @xmath19 slowly varying in space .",
    "the field @xmath18 with the wave vector @xmath20 , which is parallel to @xmath21 axis , corresponds to the strong pump wave , whereas @xmath19 with @xmath22 wave vector is assumed to be a weak probe field propagating at the small angle @xmath23 with respect to @xmath21 direction .",
    "nonlinear interaction of the intersected waves leads to the appearance of spatial polarization harmonics with the wave vectors @xmath24 ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) and harmonics of the population difference with @xmath27 wave vectors :    [ 3 ] @xmath28    the emission of @xmath29 and @xmath30 polarizations corresponds to the pump and probe fields , respectively .",
    "the emission of higher harmonics is considered to be suppressed in a thick medium , due to mismatch in dispersion relation . substituting the expansions ( [ 2 ] ) and",
    "( [ 3 ] ) into bloch equations ( [ 1 ] ) , adding maxwell equations , and using the first - order perturbation theory in respect of the small amplitude of the probe field , one can get the coupled maxwell - bloch system , describing propagation of the strong pump field ,    [ 4 ] @xmath31    and a weak probe ,    [ 5 ] @xmath32    where    @xmath33    is the cooperative frequency of the medium , which plays a role of the coupling coefficient between field and matter .",
    "we will present the numerical results of our work in the dimensionless form in the units of @xmath34 .    if the functions @xmath35 are real ( exactly resonant interaction without phase modulation of input pulses ) , the areas of the pulses , defined as    @xmath36    are very important parameters characterizing coherent propagation of short laser pulses . in the case of complex functions",
    "@xmath35 , the definition of the area does not have a general form .",
    "contrasting to the case of nonlinear pulse breakup into @xmath0 solitons @xcite , the origin of collective oscillations can be traced to the linear light - matter interaction . in this section ,",
    "we outline main features of this phenomenon , considering the propagation of the single ( pump ) field described by eqs .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) . in the linear limit of a weak ( small area ) field , where the atoms are assumed to be in the ground state with @xmath37 , eqs . ( [ 4a ] ) and ( [ 4b ] ) can be written as a single second - order differential equation    @xmath38    describing oscillations of the laser field , which propagates in a medium with high cooperative frequency @xmath34 ( [ 6 ] ) . in this section , considering the propagation of a single beam , we have omitted the subscript of the field amplitude .",
    "the problem of the free - space propagation of a short laser pulse entering an initially unperturbed medium can be solved taking the time fourier transform of eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) .",
    "the inverse fourier transform then gives the solution in the following form ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the spectrum of the laser pulse at the input of the medium at @xmath41 .",
    "the spatial evolution of spectral components is determined by the wave vector @xmath42 :    @xmath43    here , the frequency @xmath44 and the wave vector @xmath45 are defined as detunings from the resonant values @xmath9 and @xmath46 , respectively . the real part of @xmath42 determines dispersive characteristics of propagating field , whereas its imaginary part determines the absorption .",
    "depending on the relation between the field - matter coupling coefficient @xmath34 and the rate of incoherent relaxation @xmath16 , two qualitatively different frequency dependencies of the real part of @xmath42 are possible , which is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "if the relaxation rate exceeds the cooperative frequency , only one value of the frequency @xmath44 corresponds to each wave vector @xmath45 ( curve a ) . in the opposite case , where    @xmath47    there may exist three frequencies , that correspond to the same value of @xmath45 ( curve b ) .",
    "the central frequency falls to the region of the anomalous dispersion with strong absorption of the field , whereas two other solutions appear at the wings of the spectral line , where absorption may be very small .",
    "the existence of photons of equal wave vectors , but of different frequencies is a characteristic property of the resonant light - matter interaction in optically dense coherent media .",
    "this phenomenon can be treated as a density - dependent splitting of normal modes in the system of strongly coupled field - matter oscillators ( polaritons ) . in the limiting case of purely coherent interaction ( @xmath48 ) ,",
    "the polariton dispersion is represented by two separated anticrossing branches , displayed by the curve c in fig .  [ fig1](a ) .",
    "the coherent beating between normal modes of these kind can be observed , if the spatial spectrum of the field is fixed , for example , by initial conditions or by the presence of a cavity . in this context , effects such as cavity collective vacuum rabi - oscillations @xcite and oscillatory regime of superradiance under side - excitation of a sample @xcite can be mentioned . in these cases ,",
    "fixing of wave vectors leads to the appearance of a characteristic doublet in the field spectrum , which corresponds to the normal modes and manifests the existence of the `` strong - coupling regime '' determined by eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "in the situation under analysis ( [ 7 ] ) , ( [ 8 ] ) , where a laser pulse propagates in an initially unperturbed medium , the frequency content of the output field is entirely determined by the spectrum of the external source @xmath40 . due to the linearity of interaction , the absolute value of the output spectrum does not vary during the propagation , except for the trivial appearance of the absorption line .",
    "thus , in this case , contrary to collective vacuum rabi - oscillations , no coherent density - dependent spectral features can be extracted from spectral measurements . at the same time",
    ", coherent oscillations can be observed under analysis of the temporal behavior .    using the theorem about fourier transform of a product ,",
    "the solution ( [ 8 ] ) can be rewritten in the following form ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) :    @xmath49    for @xmath50 , and @xmath51 for @xmath52 . here",
    "@xmath53 , @xmath54 is the complex amplitude of the electric field at the input of the medium , and @xmath55 is the first - order bessel function .",
    "the integral kernel represents the oscillatory response of the atomic ensemble to the short delta - pulse [ @xmath56 , and thus represents the green function of the problem .",
    "the optical ringing , which is described by the bessel function in eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) , corresponds to oscillations with frequency varying in time and space .",
    "this fact reveals the principal role of propagation effects in the formation of the optical ringing . in a cross - section of the medium with the coordinate @xmath21",
    ", the inverse duration of the first short pulse , which was reradiated by the medium , is proportional to the quantity    @xmath57    the frequency of subsequent oscillations decreases in time and at the tail of the ringing is given by @xmath58 .",
    "hence , to observe at least the initial stage of the the coherent optical ringing , the following criterion should be fulfilled :    @xmath59    the frequency of the optical ringing in its initial stage increases with propagation distance @xmath21 and the medium density @xmath10 .",
    "thus , it is proportional to the number of atoms interacting via the reemission field ( here , only propagation in the forward direction is considered ) .",
    "such a dependence directly demonstrates the collective character of the field reemission by the atomic ensemble . the quantity @xmath60 ( [ 12 ] ) is a well - known parameter in the theory of dicke superradiance @xcite . unlike a single superradiant pulse , which is considered as fast collective relaxation of atoms to the ground state , the optical ringing represents fast collective oscillations that nevertheless remain coherent in a time scale of @xmath61 , which may be much longer than the duration of a single pulse of superradiance .",
    "the condition of the appearance of the optical ringing ( [ 13 ] ) is different from that of the collective vacuum rabi - oscillations ( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the relation between the field - matter coupling coefficient @xmath34 ( [ 6 ] ) and the rate of incoherent relaxation of the medium is very important for both types of collective oscillations .",
    "the relaxation rates included in our model may account for radiative and collisional broadening of a spectral line , while the inhomogeneous doppler broadening is not taken into account .",
    "nevertheless , if the processes of interest are much faster than the relaxation and the detailed shape of a narrow absorption contour is not of importance , the doppler broadening may be also approximately included in the relaxation rates considered @xcite .",
    "the expressions ( [ 10 ] ) and ( [ 13 ] ) can be considered as conditions determining a threshold value for the atomic density , which should be exceeded to obtain collective oscillations .",
    "it is important to stress , that these conditions are essentially weaker than the one necessary for other density - dependent phenomena in resonant media , such as total backward reflection @xcite and local field effects @xcite leading to the lorentz - lorenz frequency shift and intrinsic optical bistability .",
    "this fact substantiates our model presented in sec .",
    "ii , which does not take into account the latter high - density effects .    the statement , that the initial optical ringing frequency ( [ 12 ] ) displays the unlimited increase during the propagation , is valid only for the idealized situation of an input pulse having an infinitely broad spectrum . to describe more realistic conditions , we will present a simple analytical expression giving the relation between temporal behavior of the field and the spectrum of the input pulse .    for this purpose",

    "the field amplitude is determined by the spectral components lying farther and farther from the resonance .",
    "thus , the increase of the ringing frequency is limited by the frequency of non - negligible spectral components farthest from the resonance .    on the other hand , in a fixed cross - section of the medium , the time evolution of the field",

    "in contrast to collective vacuum rabi - oscillations , which are explained by the beating between two monochromatic waves of equal wave vectors [ see fig .",

    "the width of the oscillating structure obtained in this experiments was about 40  ghz .",
    "this kind of spectral features enables the analysis of the free - space optical ringing by spectral methods .",
    "the features can be obtained even in the case of linear interference with participation of the optical ringing in an optically dense resonant medium . particularly in the case , where a short laser pulse , which have passed through a medium , interferes at the output with a similar pulse , which have travelled the same distance in vacuum and having additional arbitrary time delay @xmath140 .",

    "the function ( [ 19 ] ) has an infinite number of extrema , whose frequency increases when the detuning approaches the zero . if the relaxation is taken into account , the number of oscillations is limited , and the oscillations are absent in the region of the absorption .",
    "so , the characteristic spectral oscillations can be made visible in the spectrum of the optical ringing by the change of the phase in the linear solution ( [ 8 ] ) , particularly , due to the presence of another pulse .",
    "moreover , it is the nonlinearity of the medium that can bring a specific phase shift to the interaction process . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the appearance of the spectral oscillations can be treated as interference of the quasilinear optical ringing with nonlinar solutions ( particularly , solitons ) , which have specific time delays due to the nonlinearity of interaction . in the case of pump - probe interaction",
    "presented here , it is the pump pulse that changes the propagation conditions of the probe . unlike the works @xcite , in our study , the spectral structure is obtained in the weak amplified probe field intersected with the pump .",
    "the input pump - pulse may have the area less than @xmath105 .",
    "moreover , contrary to refs .",
    "@xcite , the amplitude of the input spectrum may be negligibly small in the vicinity of the resonance and hence produces no spectral background for the observation of the specific output features .",
    "thus , the pulsed pump - probe interaction may be significantly affected by the generation of the optical ringing signal , and it is the dynamic peculiarities of the collective reemission of a resonant medium that play a key role in the processes considered .",
    "the efficiency of collective dynamics increases with the increase of the propagation distance and density of a medium . on the other hand ,",
    "the efficiency of two - beam interaction may be limited by those parameters , since under the increase of the oscillation frequency , the amplitude of the field and population difference modulation decreases .",
    "this fact reduces parametric coupling of two fields and leads to their linear propagation .",
    "we have presented the theoretical investigation of transient pump - probe interaction between short laser pulses in an optically dense resonant medium .",
    "a high value of the field - matter coupling coefficient , which is determined by the medium density , and relatively weak intensities of the external pulses give rise to the collective oscillating response of a medium in the form of the coherent optical ringing .",
    "the long ringing response , which exists in the time - scale of the order of relaxation times , provides the interaction of light fields with a medium to be much longer than the duration of short input pulses .",
    "the analytical expression obtained gives the relation between the temporal behavior of the ringing and the spectrum of the input laser - pulse .",
    "it describes the limitation of oscillation - frequency growth and the reduction of the ringing efficiency under the increasing detuning from the resonance .",
    "moreover , it supports the treatment of the optical ringing as successive coherent beats between light wave - packets of different group velocities , which in the case of a dense coherent medium , can significantly vary over the broad spectrum of the pulse .",
    "the collective dynamics of the medium is shown to essentially affect the propagation and amplification of a probe pulse under its nonlinear interaction with the pump field . in the transmission spectrum , either characteristic doublet - like structure or broad dip appears in the vicinity of the resonant frequency , depending on the time delay between the probe and pump pulses . in accordance with the spatiotemporal behavior of the optical ringing",
