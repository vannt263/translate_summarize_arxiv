    "trapped ion and atom mixtures enable us to investigate exciting physics ranging from , a single trapped ion inside a bose - einstein condensate ( bec )  @xcite and magneto - optical trap ( mot ) atoms superimposed with laser cooled ions  @xcite , to mixtures where the ions are only cooled in collision with the atoms  @xcite .",

    "this loss is measured by sweeping the ion resonance frequency or by extracting the trapped ions to charge particle detectors  @xcite . however , in mixed ion - atom trapping experiments in which the ions are optically dark , the cold trapped atoms interacting with ions can be directly measured in situ , by atomic fluorescence , without affecting the trapped ions . in this article , we develop a method to measure ion - atom collision rate coefficient in such a hybrid system using atom fluorescence as a probe .    in the experiment",
    "reported here , we trap the optically dark rubidium ( @xmath1rb@xmath0 ) ions , derived from the laser cooled @xmath1rb atoms in a mot .",
    "the ions are created and accumulated at the center of the ion trap , which overlaps with the mot .",
    "such a system evolves into a mixture with constant numbers of trapped atoms and ions in steady state .",
    "the ionization of the mot atoms and the subsequent trapped ion interaction with the atoms results in a depletion of the atoms from the mot .",
    "the consequent drop in mot fluorescence is utilized to develop the framework for the measurement of the collision rate coefficient for ion - atom interactions , as described below .    in what follows ,",
    "we construct the method for the determination of the collision rate coefficient .",
    "we first present a brief description of the experimental setup , followed by a simple , analytical rate equation model , where we systematically consider loading and loss processes of the mot atoms . here",
    "we model in a calibrated manner the change in the trapped atom number when each ion related process is turned on .",
    "this culminates with the simultaneous trapping of ions and atoms in steady state .",
    "the experimental data is then presented in a sequence consistent with the processes modeled .",
    "combining the measurements with the derived analytical expressions allows the determination of the rate of atom loss due to ion - atom interactions , and hence the collision rate coefficient for ions and atoms .",
    "we end with a discussion of some features of such measurements .",
    "the experimental arrangement ( fig .",
    "[ fig : chamber ] ) , techniques and characterization have been described in detail in previous work  @xcite . here",
    "we include a brief description for making the experimental discussion comprehensible .",
    "rb atom vapor is created from a dispenser and @xmath1rb atoms are laser cooled and trapped in a six - beam mot of size = 0.35 mm ( standard deviation ) and temperature = 166(@xmath2 28 ) @xmath3k .",
    "the cooling laser is red detuned by @xmath4 mhz with respect to the @xmath5 transition , and the laser power is 3.5 mw , per beam . a magnetic gradient field of 12 gauss / cm is utilized for the mot .",
    "the intersection point of the mot laser intensity maxima and magnetic field zero coincides with the center of a linear paul trap , built around the capture volume of the mot .",
    "this ensures that the trapped ions and laser cooled atoms are optimally overlapped  @xcite .",
    "ions are created from cold atoms using a blue light source ( bls ) which along with the cooling light results in two photon ionization of the rb mot atoms .",
    "the ion trap is made up of four parallel rods in the quadrupole configuration , where a time varying radio - frequency ( rf ) voltage is applied to one diagonal set , and an opposite phase rf voltage to the complementary diagonal set .",
    "this generates a two dimensional quadrupole field for the radial trapping of ions .",
    "two end cap ring electrodes at a positive dc voltage confine the positive ions along the trap axis .",
    "atoms are detected by observing the fluorescence from the mot on a photo - multiplier tube ( pmt ) and imaged using two ccd cameras .",
    "the mot fluorescence is measured by the pmt , where a spatial filtering arrangement is used to reduce background light signal .",
    "the ions are optically dark and are therefore detected either indirectly by a change in atomic fluorescence of the mot or destructively by extraction onto a channel electron multiplier ( cem ) and measuring the ion counts , either by pulse counting or by measurement of the proportional extracted ion signal .",
    "the ion extraction to the cem is affected by switching the ion trap end cap electrode from @xmath6 v to @xmath7 v , while the rf field is still on .",
    "we now present the rate equation framework which describes the evolution of the ion atom system as we add the various ingredients of the above experiment one at a time . the total number of atoms in the mot ( @xmath8 ) at any given time , is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the atom numbers in the ground and excited states respectively .",
    "the time dependence of @xmath8 can be written as @xmath12 with @xmath13 , the loading rate of the atoms from the background vapor into the mot and @xmath14 , the loss rate of the mot atoms , which is primarily collisional  @xcite .",
    "the time dependent solution of eqn  ( [ eq : mot_rate ] ) with initial condition @xmath15 is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the steady state atom number in the mot , in the limit of large time .",
    "the fraction of atoms in the excited state @xmath18 is determined from the photon scattering rate from an atom and can be written as  @xcite @xmath19 where , @xmath20 mhz is the rabi frequency and @xmath21 mhz is the decay rate of the excited atomic state .      the ionization of atoms in our experiment is accomplished by excitation of the atoms in the @xmath22 state to the ionization continuum using the bls . the central wavelength the bls is at @xmath23 nm , which is sufficient to ionize the excited rb atoms  @xcite .",
    "the intensity of the bls light incident on the mot is denoted by @xmath24 . for photo ionization energy @xmath25",
    ", the ionization cross - section is denoted by @xmath26 .",
    "the photon energy which is in excess of the ionization energy is carried away by the ejected electron , with the resulting ion suffering the recoil .",
    "the loading rate of the mot remains unchanged when the bls is switched on for photo ionization , as the population of the background atoms remains unchanged with operation of the bls .",
    "the maximum intensity of the bls used is 1.33 mw/@xmath27 .",
    "the rate equation for the mot , when the bls is on is modified to @xmath28 where a new loss rate @xmath29 adds to the losses inherent to the operation of the isolated mot to give a total loss rate of @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "here we assume that since the ion trap is switched off during photo ionization , the ions and electrons created from the mot atoms immediately leave the system and play no further role in determining the number of trapped atoms .",
    "the ionization rate of the excited rb atoms by radiation from the bls can be written as  @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "the corresponding time dependence of @xmath8 with initial condition @xmath15 and the inclusion of the ionizing process can then be written as @xmath33      once the ion trap is switched on , then a fraction of the created ions load into the ion trap which overlaps the mot . since the ion and atom traps are optimally overlapped , the ions created from the mot have negligible velocity upon creation .",
    "these ions gain in kinetic energy as they evolve in the field of the ion trap .",
    "as the number of ions loaded in the ion trap grows , the spatial distribution of the trapped ions increases outward from the trap centers . since the mot volume is much smaller than the volume of the trapped ion spatial distribution , therefore long before the total number of trapped ions equilibrates , the number of ions at any instant overlapped with the mot stabilizes .",
    "therefore the collisions rate between the trapped ions and the mot atoms also stabilizes rapidly , allowing the definition of a time independent binary ion - atom interaction rate , @xmath34 for the constituents of the ion - atom mixture .",
    "since atoms are weakly trapped with respect to ions , they can gain sufficient energy in collision with trapped ions to exit the mot .",
    "this is a new loss channel for the atoms trapped in a mot , which can be written as , @xmath35 the resulting time evolution for @xmath8 with initial condition @xmath15 therefore becomes , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the total loss rate of mot atoms , when the ion and atom traps are operated simultaneously as described in the experimental section above .",
    "we note that while the ion density overlapping with mot volume stabilizes rapidly , the number and the velocity distribution of the trapped ions evolve continuously till the ion trap is filled to its limit . thus the rate of ion loss from the ion trap and the evolution of @xmath8 are linked .",
    "the ion trap is loaded to the minimum of the secular trap potential , by photoionization of the overlapping mot atoms .",
    "the number of trapped ions as a function of time , for a given photo - ionizing intensity @xmath24 , can be described as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the ion trap loss rate .",
    "since ions have much higher velocities than the mot capture velocity for the atoms , ion - atom collisions will lead to loss of atoms from the mot .",
    "this allows the number of mot atoms lost due to trapped ions @xmath40 , to be written as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is saturation number of atom loss due to ion - atom interaction , and @xmath34 is the loss rate of the mot atoms due to ion - atom interactions .",

    "therefore , number of trapped ions as a function of t is expressed as , @xmath45 the number of trapped ions also depends on @xmath24 but can not increase indefinitely with @xmath24 due to finite trap depth and volume .",
    "therefore an intensity loss coefficient of trapped ions must be introduced . in the same spirit as the above discussion , to construct a general form of @xmath46 , we write @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the intensity loss coefficient and has the unit of inverse intensity .",

    "the present work relies on two important and reasonable premises , which need to be emphasized .",
    "the first is that ion - atom collisions are two body processes .",
    "this is reasonable because of several conditions that exist in the experiment .",
    "the atoms in the mot are non - interacting to a good approximation . because the ions are hot , they have large velocities and in this regime the binary ion - atom cross section is small .",
    "this is enough to make the presence of another ion in the vicinity of the collision , such that it affects the details of the ion - atom collision , highly improbable .",
    "it should be noted though that the experiment and the model are in good agreement , and since the model only incorporates two particle ion - atom collision , it is fair to argue that any more complex process is absorbed within the errors quoted in the present result .",
    "the second premise is that ion - atom collisions knock out a mot atom . in the experiment ,",
    "the only cooling mechanism for the ions is by collision with the cold atoms  @xcite .",
    "the ions are also subject to significant continuous rf heating as their numbers are large and @xmath140 , while the cooling is most effective only at the center of the mot .",
    "thus the ions are quite hot and therefore possess large velocities . under such circumstances , even a glancing ion - atom collision ,",
    "whether elastic or resonant charge exchange , will transfer sufficient energy to the laser cooled atom such that it exceeds the capture velocity of the mot and gets ejected from the mot .",
    "this then forms the basis for equating the mot loss rate with the ion - atom collision rate as described above .",
    "since the majority of ion - atom combination experiments use visible , laser cooled ions , we provide a brief discussion of some major differences . in such cases , since ion temperatures are easily in the mk levels , the ion - atom cross sections are much higher .",
    "the ions then would be crystallized and have a velocity distribution that would be well characterized . how atoms interact with such crystallized ions and what part the long range order of the ions plays in the measurement of the binary ion - atom interaction needs to be carefully understood .",
    "a possible problem is that an ion - atom collision at these energies may not result in the ejection of the colliding atom from the mot and would therefore require eq .",
    "( [ eq : collrateia ] ) to be written with a proportionality constant .",
    "however if such an equation can be written , the cross - section could be directly determined because of the well characterized velocity and density distributions of the ions .",
    "obviously , the rate equations constructed above would need to be modified according to the specifics of such a system .",
    "in a trapped ion and atom mixture , where the atoms are laser cooled and contained in a mot and the ions are trapped within a paul trap , we have developed a technique which measures the rate coefficient of ion atom collisions , even when the ions are optically dark .",

    "<S> we measure the collision rate coefficient between laser cooled rubidium ( rb ) atoms in a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) and optically dark rb@xmath0 ions in an overlapping paul trap . </S>",
    "<S> in such a mixture , the ions are created from the mot atoms and allowed to accumulate in the ion trap , which results in a significant reduction in the number of steady state mot atoms . a theoretical rate equation model is developed to describe the evolution of the mot atom number , due to ionization and ion - atom collision , and derive an expression for the ion - atom collision rate coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> the loss of mot atoms is studied systematically , by sequentially switching on the various mechanisms in the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> combining the measurements with the model allows the direct determination of the ion - atom collision rate coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> finally the scope of the experimental technique developed here is discussed . </S>"
