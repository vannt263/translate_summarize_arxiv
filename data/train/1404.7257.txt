    "the east process is a one - dimensional spin system introduced in the physics literature by jckle and eisinger  @xcite in 1991 to model the behavior of cooled liquids near the glass transition point , specializing a class of models that goes back to  @xcite .",
    "each site @xmath9 carries a @xmath10-value ( vacant / occupied ) denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "the process attempts to update @xmath11 to @xmath12 at rate @xmath13 ( a parameter ) and to @xmath14 at rate @xmath15 , only accepting the proposed update if @xmath16 ( a `` kinetic constraint '' ) .",
    "since the constraint at site @xmath7 does not depend on the spin at @xmath7 it is straightforward to verify that the product bernoulli(@xmath17 ) measure is a reversible measure .    despite of its apparent simplicity ,",
    "the east model has attracted much attention both in the physical and in the mathematical community ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "it in fact features a surprisingly rich behavior , particularly when @xmath18 which corresponds to a low temperature setting in the physical interpretation , with a host of phenomena like mixing time cutoff and front propagation @xcite , hierarchical coalescence and universality @xcite and dynamical heterogeneity @xcite , one of the main signatures of glassy dynamics .",
    "dynamical heterogeneity is strongly associated to a _ broad spectrum _ of relaxation time scales which emerges as the result of a subtle _ energy - entropy _ competition .",
    "isolated vacancies with e.g. a block of @xmath19 particles to their left , can not in fact update unless the system injects enough additional vacancies in a cooperative way in order to unblock the target one .",
    "finding the correct time scale on which this unblocking process occurs requires a highly non - trivial analysis to correctly measure the energy contribution ( how many extra vacancies are needed ) and the entropic one ( in how many ways the unblocking process may occur ) .",
    "the final outcome is a very non trivial dependence of the corresponding characteristic time scale on the equilibrium vacancy density @xmath20 and on the block length @xmath19 ( cf .",
    "@xcite*theorems 2 and 5 ) .",
    "mathematically the east model poses very challenging and interesting problems because of the hardness of the constraint and the fact that it is not attractive .",
    "it also has interesting ramifications in combinatorics @xcite , coalescence processes @xcite and random walks on triangular matrices @xcite .",
    "moreover some of the mathematical tools developed for the analysis of its relaxation time scales proved to be quite powerful also in other contexts such as card shuffling problems @xcite and random evolution of surfaces @xcite .",
    "finally it is worth mentioning that some attractive conjectures which appeared in the physical literature on the basis of numerical simulations , had to be thoroughly revised after a sharp mathematical analysis @xcite .    motivated by a series of non - rigorous contributions on _ realistic _ models of glass formers ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , in this paper we examine for the first time a natural generalization of the east process to the higher dimensional lattice @xmath0 , @xmath21 , in the sequel referred to as the _ east - like _ process . in one dimension",
    "the east - like process coincides with the east process . in @xmath22",
    "the process evolves similarly to the east process but now the kinetic constraint requires that the south _ or _",
    "west neighbor of the updating vertex contains _ at least _",
    "one vacancy .",
    "analogously in higher dimensions .",
    "an easy comparison argument with the one dimensional case shows that the east - like process is always ergodic , with a relaxation time @xmath23 which is bounded from above by @xmath24 requires that _ both _ the west _ and _ the south neighbor of @xmath7 contains a vacancy has a ergodicity breaking transition when @xmath25 crosses the oriented critical percolation value . ] . however , massive numerical simulations @xcite suggest that @xmath23 is much smaller than @xmath24 and that , as @xmath5 , it scales as @xmath26 , where the @xmath6-root is a signature of several different effects on the cooperative dynamics of the sparse vacancies : the entropy associated with the number of `` oriented '' paths over which a vacancy typically sends a wave of influence and the energetic cost of creating the required number of vacancies .    our first result ( cf . theorem",
    "[ th : main1 ] below ) confirms the above conjecture by a novel combination of renormalization group ideas and block dynamics on one hand and an algorithmically built bottleneck using capacity methods on the other .",
    "our second result analyses the relaxation time in a finite box . in this case , in order to guarantee the irreducibility of the chain , some boundary conditions must be introduced by declaring _",
    "unconstrained _ the spins belonging to certain subsets of the boundary of @xmath27 .",
    "for example in two dimensions one could imagine to freeze to the value @xmath14 all the spins belonging to the south - west ( external ) boundary of the box . in this case",
    "we say that we have _ maximal _ boundary conditions .",
    "if instead all the spins belonging to the south - west ( external ) boundary are frozen to be @xmath12 with the exception of one spin adjacent to the south - west corner then we say that we have _ minimal _ boundary conditions . in theorem",
    "[ th : main2 ] we compute the precise asymptotic as @xmath5 of the relaxation time with maximal and minimal boundary conditions and show that there is a dramatic difference between the two .",
    "the result extends also to mixing times .",
    "the third result concerns another time scale which is genuinely associated with the out - of - equilibrium behavior . for simplicity consider the process on @xmath4 and , starting from the configuration with a single vacancy at the origin , let @xmath28 be the mean hitting time of the set @xmath29 where @xmath7 is some vertex in the first quadrant . in other words it is the mean time that it takes for the initial vacancy at the origin to create a vacancy at @xmath7 . here",
    "the main outcome is a strong dependence of @xmath28 as @xmath5 not only on the @xmath8-norm @xmath30 but also on the _ direction _ of @xmath7 ( cf .",
    "theorem [ th : main3 ] and figure [ fig:1bis ] ) .",
    "when @xmath31 the process proceeds much faster ( on a logarithmic scale ) along the diagonal direction than along the coordinate axes . if instead @xmath32 as @xmath5 , then the asymptotic behavior of @xmath28 is essentially dictated by @xmath30",
    "this crossover phenomenon is yet another instance of the key role played by the energy - entropy competition in low temperature kinetically constrained models .",
    "finally in the appendix we have collected some results on the exponential rate of decay of the _ persistence function _ @xmath33 , the probability for the stationary infinite volume east - like process that the spin at the origin does not flip before time @xmath34 .",
    "such a rate of decay is often used by physicists as a proxy for the inverse relaxation time .",
    "for the east model we indeed prove that the latter assumption is correct . in higher dimension",
    "we show that the above rate of decay coincides with that of the time auto - correlation of the spin at the origin .",
    "our results are quite similar to those obtained years ago for the ising model by different methods @xcite .",
    "given the @xmath35-dimensional lattice @xmath0 we let @xmath36 . given @xmath37 and @xmath38 ,",
