    "any permutation of the source variables @xmath510 is part of an automorphism of @xmath25 .",

    "therefore , @xmath25 takes a neighborhood of @xmath13 into an irreducible complex subvariety contained in @xmath46 . after a change of coordinates on the target side we can assume that @xmath531 and the complex variety inside @xmath46 that contains the image of @xmath25 is given by @xmath532",
    "we immediately get that @xmath25 is q - equivalent to the map @xmath533 for some cr function @xmath26 .",
