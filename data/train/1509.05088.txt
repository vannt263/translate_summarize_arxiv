    "<S> it is very controversial whether radio  x - ray correlation as defined in low - hard state of x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) can extend to quiescent state ( e.g. , x - ray luminosity less than a critical value of @xmath0 ) or not . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we collect a sample of xrbs and low luminosity active galactic nuclei ( llagns ) with wide distribution of eddington ratios ( @xmath1 ) to reexplore the fundamental plane between 5 ghz radio luminosity , @xmath2 , 2 - 10 kev x - ray luminosity , @xmath3 , and black hole ( bh ) mass , @xmath4 , namely @xmath5 . for the whole sample , </S>",
    "<S> we confirm the former fundamental plane of merloni et al . and falcke et al . that @xmath6 and @xmath7 even after including more quiescent bhs </S>",
    "<S> the quiescent bhs follow the fundamental plane very well , and , however , fr i radio galaxies follow a steeper track comparing other bh sources . after excluding fr is </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the fundamental plane for bhs in quiescent state with @xmath8 and sub - eddington bhs with @xmath9 respectively , and both subsamples have a similar slope , @xmath10 , which support that quiescent bhs may behave similar to those in low - hard state . </S>",
    "<S> we further select two subsamples of agns with bh mass in a narrow range ( fr is with @xmath11 and other llagns with @xmath12 ) to simulate the behavior of a single supermassive bh evolving from sub - eddington to quiescent state . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the highly sub - eddington sources with @xmath13 still roughly stay on the extension of radio  x - ray correlation as defined by other sub - eddington bhs . </S>",
    "<S> our results are consistent with several recent observations in xrbs that the radio  x - ray correlation as defined in low - hard state can extend to highly sub - eddington quiescent state .    </S>",
