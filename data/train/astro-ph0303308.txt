    "additionally , the observation that not all absorbers found in one sight line have corresponding absorption in the other sight line implies that these are elongated structures rather than enormous spherical halos if the structures are `` contiguous . ''",

    "while this is only a single incidence , a size limit of @xmath72 225 h@xmath11 kpc ( the distance between these two sightlines at this redshift ) supports the collisionally - ionized model for this absorber advocated by t2002 , because a photoionized model for this absorber requires a very large physical size ; i.e. , we would expect a very large photoionized absorber to be more uniform over these two sight lines . as shown by examples in tripp et al .",

    "therefore , despite the better stis resolution and sensitivity , the @xmath108v @xmath109 criterion for absorber coincidences still seems reasonable over such large separations . while line pair matches within 150  suggest a relationship between these absorber pairs , the velocities , equivalent widths , and profile shapes are not so well correlated as to require `` contiguous '' structures stretching across these two sight lines ( see e.g. rauch et al . 2001 examination of sub - kpc separated sight lines at high-@xmath13 ) .",
    "however , we can not rule out the existence of a low column density ( @xmath110 @xmath111 ) contiguous structure , augmented at specific locations by higher column density gas ; e.g. , galaxy halos or winds embedded in a large - scale gaseous filament . the presence of a galaxy at similar velocity to the 1586  absorber and at a small impact parameter from 3c  273 ( t2002 and penton et al .",
    "2002 ) may be evidence for this interpretation .",
    "the small number of absorbers found in these two sight lines and the possible `` special conditions '' of the virgo cluster make statistical inference based upon this one sight line pair insecure .",

    "the combination of hst stis echelle and fuse spectroscopy are insufficient to provide similarly tight constraints .",
    "the fuse spectrum is sufficient to rule out column densities as low as 10@xmath112 2  and set a probable lower limit of = 10@xmath27 2  for each absorber due to significant detections of ly-@xmath113 and ly-@xmath114 in both components and possible detections of ly-@xmath26 , ly-@xmath25 and ly-@xmath35 in at least one component . additionally , the low @xmath6-values that would be required to fit  rule out column densities above = 17.0 2 .",
    "we use the available stis echelle and fuse data to infer the physical conditions of these absorbers .",
    "the metal line ratios ( n(c  iv)/n(c  ii ) and n(si  iv)/n(si  ii ) ) constrain the ionization parameter ( -2.85@xmath4log @xmath115 - 2.60 ) for our best - guess model , assuming the gas is photoionized . assuming a standard value for the extragalactic ionizing radiation intensity",
    ", we can translate this to limits on the density of the gas .",
    "if we knew the metallicity of these structures , this would constrain the hydrogen column density and thus the absorber size along our line - of - sight . by assuming the same metallicity for these absorbers as for the 3c  273 absorber located some 35070  kpc away and column densities of = 16  17 , consistent with constraints from the stis and fuse data , we calculate line - of - sight sizes of 10  30 kpc . since these metallicities and column densities are similar to those obtained by t2002 , the larger physical sizes obtained here are due to the higher ionization ( lower density ) of the rx j1230.8 + 0115 absorbers ( c  iv is detected here , but not in 3c  273 ) . the blended absorbers studied here have inferred line - of - sight sizes a factor of 7  300 times less than the minimum transverse size based upon detecting absorption in both sight lines at comparable redshifts , while the 1586  absorber in 3c  273 has a size that is a factor of @xmath04300 smaller than the minimum transverse size .",
    "this much larger inferred transverse size is more suggestive of objects associated with large scale structure than with individual galaxies , while the smaller line - of - sight sizes are more consistent with structures related to individual galaxies ( e.g. , very extended halos or outflowing winds ) .",

    "the fact that the dwarf galaxy 7170  kpc from 3c  273 was missed by @xcite provides a warning that the rx j1230.8 + 0115 region may not have been surveyed sufficiently well to conclude that there are no galaxies of similar luminosity near these blended absorbers , although there have been a number of relatively deep , independent surveys of this region .",
    "if another faint galaxy is found close to rx j1230.8 + 0115 at @xmath1231700 , then the model of outflowing winds from dwarf galaxies @xcite is an exceptional fit for both the 3c  273 and rx j1230.8 + 0115 @xmath1231700  absorbers @xcite . the higher than average galaxy density ( @xmath124 times the average ) in this region at the southern edge of the virgo cluster make this a reasonable possibility .",

    "one possible scenario is that while these absorbers have small thicknesses , they could be quite extended on the sky if the metal enriched gas is in the form of a thin shell surrounding a galaxy , perhaps driven by a wind . in this case",
    ", the area on the sky would be substantially larger than the thickness derived from photoionization ; e.g. , the radius of the shell could extend 50 ",
    "100h@xmath11 kpc from the galaxy if the distance to the galaxy near the 3c  273 absorber is indicative of the size of these shells ( impact parameter @xmath128 kpc ;  4 and stocke et al .",
    "2003 ) . in this case",
    ", only a few ( @xmath04 ) gaseous shells would be required to have the covering fraction of unity necessitated by the 3c  273/rx  j1230.8 + 0115 observations . in the shell scenario , it would also be quite natural to find two absorbers closely spaced in velocity along a single sight line ( e.g. , rx  j1230.8 + 0115 ) due to the interception of both sides of the expanding shell of gas .",
    "for a 75 kpc radius shell with an expansion velocity of 18  ( the separation between the rx  j1230.8 + 0115 metal lines ) the epoch of star formation would have occured @xmath0 @xmath129 yrs ago expelling @xmath130  of gas ( given the average rx  j1230.8 + 0115 gas density and shell thickness ) .",
    "thus , the galaxy putatively associated with the enriched gas in these absorbers does not need to be currently forming stars .",
    "this is the case for the dwarf near the 3c  273 absorber @xcite , which would have had to expel @xmath131  of gas in this scenario .",
    "this scenario requires large masses of gas to have been expelled from galaxies , but may be compelling if another galaxy is found near rx  j1230.8 + 0115 . given the significant amount of optical spectroscopy already expended on this region , it may be more likely that the column density of the absorber is on the high end of our range , making the metallicity significantly smaller . in this lower metallicity scenario , these systems could represent more primordial overdensities expected to be associated with large scale structure @xcite .",
    "given the proximity of these absorbers to us , this region is the best available laboratory with which to test this hypothesis so we are presently surveying the region at the 21 cm line of h  i to look for gas - rich galaxies as well as continuing our optical spectroscopy to answer this question definitively .",
