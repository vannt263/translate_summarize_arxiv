    "we first follow the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite about a separation of relevant time scales in rest frame of target nucleus .    in rest frame of target nucleus at fixed target experiments , the interaction time when proton scatters off nucleus",

    "then , one finds @xmath21 . in this respect , at forward rapidity (",

    "in other words , the @xmath13 pair is produced coherently in p@xmath1 collision at high energy .",
    "indeed , the coherent interaction between the @xmath13 and a large number of gluons in the target nucleus can reflect important information on the gluon saturation .",
    "the time scale of @xmath10 formation can be estimated as @xmath24 with @xmath25 mass of @xmath10 and @xmath26 mass of @xmath27 . since the binding energy of quarkonium is much smaller than @xmath15",
