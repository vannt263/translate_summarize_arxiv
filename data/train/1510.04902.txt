    "several important materials , such as iron - based high critical temperature superconductors ( fesc),@xcite nickelates,@xcite cobaltites,@xcite manganites,@xcite and many others , have several active orbitals . if electronic correlation effects are important , then multiorbital hubbard models must be employed for their analysis . however , these models are difficult to study in two ( 2d ) or three ( 3d ) dimensions due to their complexity . while at particular electronic densities , such as integer fillings , zero temperature mean field ( mf ) approximations are often reliable , the phase diagrams of multiorbital hubbard models varying _ temperature _ @xmath3 are basically unknown .",
    "this is because thermal mean - field approximations provide qualitatively incorrect results at robust hubbard repulsion @xmath2 and intermediate temperature since they can not generate local moments with short - range magnetic order because of the absence of spatial fluctuations .",
    "moreover , `` sign problems '' complicate the application of quantum monte carlo ( mc ) when several orbitals are active.@xcite since not only @xmath2 but also the hund coupling @xmath4 are important , it is imperative to apply alternative computational tools , even if crude , to study multiorbital models at intermediate temperatures because the potential for new states in these systems is considerable .",
    "recently,@xcite the `` monte carlo - mean field '' ( mc - mf ) technique that mixes the mc and mf approximations was tested using the half - filled one - orbital hubbard model .",
    "the method captured all qualitative features of this model known from quantum monte carlo , including the non - monotonic behavior of the nel temperature @xmath5 with increasing @xmath2 , and it was even quantitatively accurate with errors of only @xmath620% in @xmath5.@xcite this method was applied before to the bec - bcs crossover in the cold atom context and to other problems.@xcite early studies within the spin - fermion model context showed that this type of techniques are also reliable in studies of superconductors.@xcite    the new method relies on the hubbard - stratonovich decomposition of the interacting problem via auxiliary fields ( auxf )  @xcite ( in the hartree channel in our study , but could be in other channels as well ) . neglecting the auxf s imaginary - time dependence but retaining their spatial fluctuations leads to a hamiltonian with quantum fermions coupled to classical degrees of freedom , similarly as in double - exchange models for manganites.@xcite classical monte carlo is used for the auxf at any temperature , while the fermionic sector is treated via the traveling cluster approximation ( tca ) that allows access to large lattices.@xcite    in this publication , the mc - mf technique is applied for the first time to a 2d two - orbital hubbard model , varying temperature @xmath3 and repulsion @xmath2 .",
    "the unveiled phase diagram is rich , including a narrow nematic phase above @xmath5.@xcite even more importantly , here we report an unexpected novel regime , dubbed orbital selective directional conductor ( osdc ) , where a remarkable anisotropy in transport is observed , with one direction insulating and the other conducting , leading to a dimensional reduction from 2d to 1d .",
    "this dimensional reduction is different from that in tl@xmath7ru@xmath7o@xmath8 and bacusi@xmath7o@xmath9 because they are insulating in all directions ,  @xcite and different from layered sr@xmath10ru@xmath7o@xmath8 because it requires a high magnetic field .",
    "@xcite our results are also different from layered oxides that are metallic in - plane but insulating out - of - plane,@xcite because their crystal structure already establishes an asymmetry . on the contrary ,",
    "our two - dimensional model is fully symmetric between the @xmath11 and @xmath12 directions but _ spontaneously _ becomes insulating in one direction and metallic in the other , without the help of the lattice , magnetic fields , or impurities .",
    "although five orbitals are needed for a faithful electronic description of iron superconductors , below for simplicity we will focus on the two most important orbitals @xmath0 and @xmath1.@xcite the two - orbital hubbard model studied here is defined as :    @xmath13 where @xmath14 creates an electron at site @xmath15 , orbital @xmath16 ( either @xmath17 or @xmath18 ) , and with spin projection @xmath19 .",
    "the number operator is @xmath20 , @xmath21=@xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",

    "the usual constraints @xmath26 and @xmath27 are assumed . in the hund term",
    "only the ising portion is used because the expected magnetic order is collinear , most materials have an easy - axis , and it is technically simpler for this first study .",
    "the hopping parameters reproduce the fermi surface of the undoped fesc,@xcite but our conclusions could be realized as well in other materials with local tetragonal symmetry .",
    "the crystal location of the se , as , or p atoms , used by electrons to tunnel from fe to fe , justify that both nearest- ( nn ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) hoppings are needed .",
    "the explicit hopping amplitudes are in previous publications .",

    "these previous @xmath3=@xmath40 studies and others  @xcite showed that @xmath43 is relevant for fesc , and we will fix @xmath44 in all the results below . since fesc materials vary substantially in their degree of electronic correlation , results will be presented varying the ratio @xmath41 .",
    "our main focus are the temperature effects since their influence on model eq .",

    "the tca traveling cluster  @xcite is @xmath46 . via the parallelized version of tca,@xcite lattices as large as @xmath47 were reached .",
    "the mean - field approach was chosen to be the hartree approximation that works well for the half - filled one - orbital model.@xcite",
    "our main results are in the phase diagram of model eq.(1 ) at @xmath39 ( fig .",
    "[ rf-1 ] ) .",
    "it was constructed based on data for the two spin structure factors of relevance , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , the spin nematic order parameter @xmath50,@xcite their temperature derivatives , and the resistivity and density of states ( dos ) .",
    "we also monitored local moment formation at intermediate temperature and large @xmath41.@xcite this phase diagram is surprisingly rich because it contains _ three _ regimes with @xmath51 long - range magnetic order [ degenerate with @xmath52 .",
    "the insulator at large @xmath41 is induced by the robust @xmath4 that produces @xmath53=1 local spins interacting via a frustrated heisenberg model known to have @xmath51-@xmath54 magnetic order .",
    "the other two states at intermediate couplings are more subtle .",
    "intuitively , their magnetic order can be considered as arising from fermi surface nesting effects .",
    "however , the presence of @xmath55 , instead of one , regions is unexpected .",
    "the first one , dubbed af - m ( antiferromagnetic metallic ) , is metallic in both directions , albeit anisotropic , as observed in fesc experiments.@xcite but the second region , the osdc , is metallic along the spin staggered direction but insulating along the spin uniform direction , leading to a surprising dimensional reduction at intermediate couplings .",
    "a typical magnetic order parameter ( @xmath56 ) displays a negative curvature increasing temperature(fig .",
    "[ rf-2]a ) , with a diverging slope at the critical temperature @xmath57 in the bulk limit .",
    "thus , for a finite system the temperature where the first derivative d@xmath56/d@xmath3 is maximized , or where the associated susceptibility maximizes , provides an estimation of @xmath57 ( here @xmath5 and @xmath58)(fig .",
    "[ rf-2]b ) .",
    "in addition , upon cooling @xmath58 can also be estimated from the temperature @xmath59 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 split . while for a finite system @xmath58 and @xmath59 may be different , they should merge in the bulk limit .",
    "typical results are in fig .",
    "[ rf-2 ] for a @xmath45 lattice , at a fixed ratio @xmath41 .",
    "our mc statistics and lattice sizes are sufficient to observe a robust order parameter behavior for @xmath48 and @xmath50 : nonzero at @xmath60 and decreasing with increasing temperature with a negative curvature , with the exception of a small temperature window where the curvature is positive due to size effects .",
    "although very close in temperature , systematically for all the couplings @xmath41 with long range spin order at @xmath60 and for all lattices , we find @xmath58 slightly larger than @xmath5 suggesting a small region of nematicity .",
    "in general , we also found that @xmath59 tends to be larger than @xmath58 .",
    "the observed narrow window of nematicity in fact appears to survive a finite - size scaling analysis ( fig .",
    "[ rf-4](a ) ) , at least for the investigated coupling @xmath61 where information for lattices as large as @xmath47 were gathered ( since these simulations are very time consuming the scaling analysis could be done only for one coupling ) .",
    "remarkably , within the error bars the bulk limit extrapolated @xmath58 and @xmath59 seem to lead to the same nematic critical temperature .",
    "more specifically , our results unveil a small nematic window of @xmath62 at @xmath61 .",
    "the narrowness of this nematic regime is likely exaggerated by the z(2 ) nature of the ising approximation used here for the hund term .",
    "such a fragile nematic phase , reported here for the first time in a hubbard model , is compatible with previous studies using spin models,@xcite spin - fermion models,@xcite and with experiments,@xcite that have also reported very narrow nematic temperature windows .",
    "as explained before it is surprising that there are three distinct regions below @xmath5 : two metals ( af - m and osdc ) and one insulator ( af - i ) . the distinction between the two metals and the insulator can be understood via the density - of - states in figs .",
    "[ rf-4](b , c ) .",
    "panel ( c ) displays a canonical insulating behavior : in the temperature range shown , a pseudogap ( pg ) is observed in the local moments regime,@xcite transforming into a full gap when the magnetic order develops at @xmath5 .",
    "this is the af - i state ( fig .",
    "[ rf-1 ] ) . in panel",
    "( b ) , upon cooling toward @xmath5 a pseudogap opens probably because of fermi surface nesting effects .",
    "but even at low temperatures , and independently analyzing the zero - temperature hartree equations , in both metallic regions the total dos has a finite weight at the fermi energy @xmath63 .",
    "what is then the difference between af - m and osdc ?",
    "their physical distinction is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ rf-5 ]  ( a ) where the resistivity @xmath64 vs. @xmath3 is presented at three values of @xmath41 , corresponding to the three low - temperature regions of fig .",
    "@xmath64 is calculated from the optical conductivity @xmath65 , integrating in a narrow range near @xmath66 and then inverting.@xcite at @xmath67 , @xmath64 in the @xmath12 spin uniform direction is larger than in the @xmath11 spin staggered direction , as in previous calculations  @xcite and experiments.@xcite this is understood from the orbital resolved dos of fig .",
    "[ rf-4](d ) : in the magnetic @xmath51 state that breaks rotational invariance , near @xmath63 the orbital @xmath1 , related to conduction in the spin uniform direction , is more suppressed than @xmath0 , related to conduction in the spin staggered direction .",
    "but since both orbitals have a sizable dos weight at the @xmath63 , both directions are metallic . at large @xmath68 , the dos fig .",
    "[ rf-4](c ) displays a sharp gap at low temperature , and both directions must be insulating .",
    "note that experiments affected primarily by the vicinity of @xmath63 may suggest strong orbital order , but the @xmath69-integral of the orbital - resolved dos , i.e. the orbital population @xmath70 and @xmath71 , is only different by 0.5% ( fig .",
    "[ rf-4 ]  ( f)).@xcite for completeness , we also monitored @xmath72 vs. temperature .",
    "the results ( not shown ) indicate that upon cooling from high @xmath3 , @xmath73 remains smaller than 0.001 at @xmath41=@xmath74 until @xmath58 is reached , eventually converging , as @xmath3 is further reduced , to the results derived from fig .",
    "[ rf-4 ]  ( f ) . within our mc accuracy",
    "we conclude that in our model there is no additional orbital - order critical temperature above @xmath58 .",
    "the interpolation between small and large @xmath41 unveils a surprise : at intermediate couplings such as @xmath75 the spin staggered direction remains metallic , but the spin uniform direction becomes @xmath76 ( fig .",
    "[ rf-5 ]  ( a ) ) . intuitively , this is because the interpolation between the density - of - states of fig .",
    "[ rf-4](d ) , where both orbitals have nonzero weight at @xmath63 , and ( c ) , where both orbitals have negligible weight at @xmath63 , is not smooth . instead",
    ", there is an intermediate coupling range where the @xmath1 weight at @xmath63 is almost negligible while that of @xmath0 is still finite ( fig .",
    "[ rf-4](e ) ) .",
    "the @xmath1 weight is very small but not zero , even at @xmath60 , because of the broadening used for density of states .",
    "therefore , strictly speaking it can not be used as a sharp order parameter : af - m and osdc are likely analytically connected because they break the same symmetries .",
    "however , our study shows that the orbital population difference at @xmath63 in the osdc is sufficiently large to induce one - dimensional transport .",
    "results for the full @xmath65 ( see fig .",
    "[ rf-5 ]  ( b ) and appendix ) show that at @xmath77 only one orbital dominates . moreover , from @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( fig .",
    "[ rf-4 ]  ( f ) ) note that at large @xmath41 both orbital populations converge to one since @xmath4 is large , while in the pm - m regime they are also one by symmetry .",
    "however , in the osdc region _ both _ @xmath70 and @xmath71 are different from one ( and different among themselves because @xmath78 is spontaneously broken ) : the osdc regime is not the same as an orbital selective mott phase  @xcite where one orbital has population exactly one .",
    "another interesting observation is that for both af - m and osdc there is an insulating region @xmath79 in both directions immediately above @xmath5 due to the opening of the pseudogap in the local moments region and concomitant coexisting patches of ( @xmath80,0 ) and ( 0,@xmath80 ) order,@xcite in agreement with spin fermion studies  @xcite and experiments.@xcite      the analysis presented in fig .",
    "[ rf-2 ] and fig .",
    "[ rf-4](a ) are just examples of the vast computational study carried out at various values of @xmath41 and used to construct the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ rf-1 ] . for completeness , in fig .  [ srf-1 ] this substantial effort",
    "is illustrated further by providing data corresponding to other lattice sizes at @xmath61 .",

    "the phase diagram of a layered two - orbitals hubbard model was studied with emphasis on temperature effects .",
    "we report a novel intermediate coupling @xmath2 region , called the osdc , that is conducting in one direction via the @xmath0 orbitals , but insulating in the other because the associated @xmath1 orbitals have nearly vanishing weight at @xmath63 .",
    "although our low temperature calculations do not include quantum fluctuations , the osdc starts at relatively high temperatures @xmath81 and for this reason our approach emphasizing thermal effects should be sufficient .",
    "moreover , we tested that using other hoppings,@xcite the osdc is also found .",
    "experimentally , materials of the family of iron superconductors are the most likely to realize the osdc ( in fact , indications of osdc are already present in ref .   for the case of doped materials ) , and a mixing in the chemical formula of as , associated with weak coupling , and se , associated with strong coupling , may be needed .",
    "but the osdc could be realized in other layered materials where a transition metal atom m is coordinated with four ligand atoms x , establishing mx@xmath82 tetrahedral cages with near degenerate @xmath0 and @xmath1 orbitals , and where a magnetic state that breaks lattice rotational invariance is stabilized .",

    ", the double occupation has to be below a cutoff for the system to have local moments.@xcite this is of particular importance at small @xmath2 values because @xmath115 can have a considerable contribution from the electronic delocalization and in this regime it can not be used to track local moment formation .      the many - body technique used in this publication",
    "was already introduced and tested in previous efforts.@xcite however , since an easy axis is present in most materials and considering that empirically the monte carlo convergence is improved under such circumstances ( colloquially , ising is easier than heisenberg ) , in this project it was decided to use the ising approximation in the hund term . in the language of the one - orbital hubbard model that corresponds to using the hartree approximation instead of the hartree - fock approximation employed before .",
    "this requires , then , a test of the hartree assumption for the three - dimensional one - orbital standard hubbard model at half - filling .",
