    "<S> the application of the quasi - steady - state approximation to the michaelis - menten reaction embedded in large open chemical reaction networks is a popular model reduction technique in deterministic and stochastic simulations of biochemical reactions inside cells . </S>",
    "<S> it is frequently assumed that the predictions of the reduced master equations obtained using the stochastic quasi - steady - state approach are in very good agreement with the predictions of the full master equations , provided the conditions for the validity of the deterministic quasi - steady - state approximation are fulfilled . </S>",
    "<S> we here use the linear - noise approximation to show that this assumption is not generally justified for the michaelis - menten reaction with substrate input , the simplest example of an open embedded enzyme reaction . </S>",
    "<S> the reduced master equation approach is found to considerably overestimate the size of intrinsic noise at low copy numbers of molecules . </S>",
    "<S> a simple formula is obtained for the relative error between the predictions of the reduced and full master equations for the variance of the substrate concentration fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum error is reached when modeling moderately or highly efficient enzymes , in which case the error is approximately @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical predictions are validated by stochastic simulations using experimental parameter values for enzymes involved in proteolysis , gluconeogenesis and fermentation .    </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that whenever transients in the concentration of a substrate species decay over a much slower timescale than those of the enzyme species , one can invoke the quasi - steady - state approximation ( qssa ) to considerably simplify the deterministic ( macroscopic ) rate equations.@xcite the study by rao and arkin@xcite pioneered the use of the same approximation but on a mesoscopic level , i.e. , applying a stochastic version of the approximation to obtain reduced chemical master equations . </S>",
    "<S> this approximation has since become ubiquitous in stochastic simulations of large biochemical reaction networks inside cells ( see , for example , refs .  ) </S>",

    "<S> a plausible hypothesis is that the stochastic qssa is valid in the same regions of parameter space where the deterministic qssa is known to be valid . a handful of numerical studies @xcite have shown that for some choices of rate constants which are compatible with the deterministic qssa , the differences between the reduced and full master equation approaches are practically negligible . </S>",
    "<S> however , none of these studies exclude the possibility that there exist regions of parameter space where the deterministic qssa is valid but the stochastic qssa exhibits large systematic errors in its predictions . in particular , one is interested in knowing how accurate are the predictions of the stochastic qssa for the size of intrinsic noise , i.e. , the size of fluctuations in concentrations , since such noise is known to play important functional roles in biochemical circuits.@xcite numerical approaches can not easily answer such questions because the stochastic simulation algorithm , the standard method which exactly samples the trajectories of master equations,@xcite is computationally expensive.@xcite    in this communication , we seek to develop a theoretical approach to answer the following question : given that the rate constants are chosen such that the deterministic qssa is valid , what are the differences between the predictions of the reduced and full master equations for the variance of the fluctuations about the mean concentrations ? </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a formula estimating the size of these differences for the simplest biochemical circuit which embeds the michaelis - menten reaction and confirm its accuracy using stochastic simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we find , using physiological parameter values , that the reduced master equation approach can overestimate the variance of the fluctuations by as much as @xmath1 .    </S>",

    "<S> the reaction can be described as follows . </S>",
    "<S> substrate molecules ( species @xmath6 ) are pumped into some compartment at a constant rate , they bind to free enzyme molecules ( species @xmath7 ) to form substrate - enzyme complexes ( species @xmath8 ) which then either decay back to the original substrate and free enzyme molecules or else decay into free enzyme and product molecules ( species @xmath9 ) . the first reaction in ( [ eqn : mmreaction ] ) could equally represent the production of substrate by a first - order chemical reaction provided the species transforming into substrate exists in concentrations large enough such that fluctuations in its concentration can be ignored . </S>",
    "<S> the sum of the concentrations of free enzyme and complex is a constant since the enzyme can only be in one of these two forms . </S>",
    "<S> hence , all mathematical descriptions of the michaelis - menten reaction can be expressed in terms of just complex and substrate variables . on the macroscopic level , </S>",
    "<S> the qssa proceeds by considering the case in which transients in the complex concentration decay much faster than those of the substrate . </S>",
    "<S> this condition of timescale separation is imposed by setting the time derivative of the macroscopic complex concentration to zero , solving for the steady - state complex concentration and substituting the latter into the rate equation for the substrate concentration which leads to the new rate equation @xmath10 = k_{in } - \\frac{k_2 [ e_t ] [ x_s(t)]}{k_m + [ x_s(t ) ] } , \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 $ ] is the substrate concentration at time @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the michaelis - menten constant , and @xmath14 $ ] is the total enzyme concentration , i.e. , the sum of the concentration of free enzyme , @xmath15 $ ] , and of the concentration of complex , @xmath16 $ ] , which is a constant as previously mentioned . </S>",

    "<S> note that while the first reaction is elementary , the second is clearly not , since it can clearly be broken down into a set of more fundamental constituent reactions . </S>",

    "<S> also note that the maximum error in all cases is reached at @xmath77 , namely , when the enzyme is half saturated with substrate which occurs when the substrate concentrations are equal to the michaelis - menten constant @xmath57 ( this is the case for most enzymes of the glycolytic pathway @xcite ) ; for substrate concentrations much smaller or larger than @xmath57 , the error is negligible .    </S>",

    "<S> our study has focused on the most common type of stochastic qssa in the literature which is heuristic in nature and hence the question regarding its validity . </S>",
    "<S> there are a class of alternative model reduction techniques @xcite based on singular - perturbation analysis ( sqspa and sqspa-@xmath28 ) which are rigorous and whose validity is not under question . for the michaelis - menten reaction without substrate input , these methods lead to a reduced master equation of the same form as the heuristic stochastic qssa whenever the free enzyme or complex concentrations are very small ( see table ii of ref .  ) . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that for such conditions the error in the predictions of the stochastic qssa should be zero , a result which is also reproduced by our method . </S>",
    "<S> however , note that though these concentration conditions can be compatible with the deterministic qssa they are not synonymous with it . </S>",
    "<S> the sqspa methods do not lead to a reduced master equation for parameters consistent with the deterministic qssa and hence can not make statements regarding the accuracy of the heuristic stochastic qssa in such conditions . </S>",

    "<S> _ @xcite also studied the reaction system ( [ eqn : mmreaction ] ) using numerical simulations and found little difference between the predictions of the stochastic qssa and the full master equation . </S>",
    "<S> the study used values of @xmath82 ( see table @xmath83 in ref .  ) and hence in the light of our results , it is clear why they observed high accuracy of the stochastic qssa . </S>",
    "<S> however , as we have shown , this is not the general case : many enzymes have large @xmath54 and hence discrepancies of the order of few tens of percent between the predictions of the reduced and full approaches will be visible whenever substrate concentrations are approximately equal to the michaelis - menten constant .    ohphs l.  a.  segel and m.  slemrod , siam rev . * </S>",
