    "experimental and theoretical studies of iron based sulphides have been of considerable interest in the last few decades , in the geophysical context , in view of their occurrence in marine systems and surface of earth as well as other planetary systems@xcite .",
    "these compounds exhibit a wide range of interesting structural characteristics such as epitaxial inter - and over - growth of their polymorphic phases at lower temperatures .",
    "also , they are found to exist in a variety of iron or sulphur deficient forms , which has implications on their mining and geochemical processing @xcite . among the iron based sulphides",
    ", fes@xmath0 is the most abundant natural mineral , and it is available in two closely related polymorphic structures , _",
    "viz._,marcasite and pyrite .",
    "marcasite fes@xmath0 is the commonly available mineral in hydrothermal systems and in sedimentary rocks , whereas pyrite fes@xmath0 is the most abundant mineral on the earth s surface .",
    "several works have been reported in the past to investigate the similarities and differences between marcasite and pyrite crystal structures @xcite . in both the structures ,",
    "the fe atoms are octahedrally coordinated with six s atoms and the s atoms are in tetrahedral coordination with three fe atoms and one s atom . in detail ,",
    "marcasite fes@xmath0 crystallizes in the orthorhombic structure ( space group @xmath2 , z=2 ) with wyckoff position @xmath3 for fe , and @xmath4 for s. the sulphur octahedra , with which the fe atoms are octahedrally coordinated , share the @xmath5 $ ] edges- see the crystal structure as shown in fig",
    "on the other hand , pyrite fes@xmath0 crystallizes in cubic structure ( space group @xmath6 , z=4 ) with wyckoff position @xmath7 for fe and @xmath8 for s. thus in the pyrite structure , the fe atoms are situated at the corners and face centers , whereas the s atoms are placed in the form of s - s dumbbells oriented along @xmath9 directions with their centers at the body center and edge centers of the cube .",
    "a number of experiments have been performed on bulk pyrite and also on surfaces aiming to study the spectroscopic properties due to their potential applications in photo - voltaic industry @xcite .",
    "jagadessh and seehra performed electrical resistivity measurements on natural marcasite and its energy gap was found to be 0.34 ev @xcite .",
    "the dynamical properties of these compounds have been measured by different experimental and theoretical methods @xcite .",
    "apart from these experiments , several theoretical studies have also been carried out to explore the structural properties of fes@xmath0 using combinations of density functional theory ( dft ) , gaussian / plane - wave basis sets and all - electron / pseudopotential approaches .",
    "the mechanical properties of pyrite fes@xmath0 have been explored at different pressures using classical inter - atomic potentials and marcasite is predicted to react in a manner similar to pyrite when compressed @xcite .",
    "the electronic structure calculations for fes@xmath0 were performed using non empirical atomic orbital method and the band gaps are reported for pyrite and marcasite forms of fes@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "et al _ @xcite has given a detailed discussion about the interband transitions in pyrite fes@xmath0 through optical properties .",
    "@xcite performed both experimental and theoretical investigations and concluded that cubic symmetry exists under high pressure conditions .",
    "albeit availability of numerous studies that analyze pyrite and marcasite from various perspectives , a precise study on both the polymorphic forms of fes@xmath0 is needed to explain the phase stability of fes@xmath0 at ambient conditions . in the present work",
    ", we have studied both the polymorphic forms of fes@xmath0 and have accounted for the first order phase transition between marcasite and pyrite at high pressure and at zero temperature accompanied by a reasonable volume collapse which was not shown in any of the earlier studies and we have also speculated on the reasons driving the transition .",
    "ruoshi sun _",
    "et al _ @xcite have also studied the relative stability of fes@xmath0 with the aim to explore the photo - voltaic performance of fes@xmath0 .",
    "similarly , it is also interesting to note that fes@xmath0 possesses a fairly good thermopower@xcite , which has not been addressed theoretically till now .",
    "thermoelectric materials ( te ) find potential applications including power generation , refrigeration , and had been a thrust area of research for the experimentalists and theoreticians for the past few decades , provoking their thoughts in search of a material with better performance . te materials can convert waste heat into electric power and",
    "hence they can play a vital role in meeting the present energy crisis and environment pollution @xcite .",
    "the performance of a te material is quantified by the dimensionless figure of merit zt which is given by zt = s@xmath10@xmath11t/@xmath12 , where s , @xmath11 , t , @xmath12 are the seebeck coefficient , electrical conductivity , absolute temperature and the thermal conductivity ( which includes both the electronic @xmath12@xmath13 and lattice contribution @xmath12@xmath14 .",
    "_ i.e. _ @xmath12=@xmath12@xmath13+@xmath12@xmath14 ) respectively .",
    "it is clear that the value of zt can be increased by making the values of thermo power and electrical conductivity high while keeping the value of thermal conductivity low . assuming that the value of @xmath12 can be reduced to the amorphous limit",
    ", a way of maximizing zt is to maximize @xmath15 .",
    "we have calculated the thermoelectric properties of fes@xmath0 in both the polymorphic phases for the first time in this perspective .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we describe the method used for the theoretical calculations and structural properties are presented in section iii . in section iv , we discuss the electronic structure and thermoelectric properties are presented in section v and conclusions are given in section vi .",
    "all the total energy calculations were performed using plane wave self - consistent field ( pwscf ) program based on density functional theory , plane wave basis set and pseudo potential method @xcite . the total energies are obtained by solving the kohn - sham equation self consistently within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) of perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) potential @xcite . a plane wave kinetic energy cut off of 50 ry is used and the first brillouin zone is sampled according to the monkhorst - pack scheme @xcite by means of a @xmath16 k - mesh in order to ensure well converged results .",
    "the electron - ion interactions are described by vanderbilt type ultrasoft pseudo potentials @xcite and the pseudo potentials are treated with nonlinear core corrections with the following basis set fe : 3s@xmath10 3p@xmath17 3d@xmath17 4s@xmath10 and s : 3s@xmath10 3p@xmath18 as valence states .",
    "the variable - cell structural optimization has been performed using broyden - fletcher - goldfarb - shanno ( bfgs ) algorithm as implemented in pwscf . in order to obtain information about the relative phase stability of marcasite and pyrite phases as a function of pressure",
    ", we have calculated the cohesive energy of both the phases at pressures ranging from -3 gpa ( expansion ) to 9 gpa ( compression ) with a step size of 0.5 gpa . for each pressure ,",
    "structural optimization of the unit cell has been carried out by relaxing positions of all the atoms together with the necessary changes in the shape and volume .",
    "the threshold criteria of @xmath19 ry for total energies , @xmath20 ry / bohr for the maximum force and 0.002 gpa for total stress were used for the structural relaxation .",
    "the phonon dispersion calculations are performed within the frame work of density functional perturbation theory ( dfpt ) .",
    "dynamical matrices were setup and diagonalized for phonon wavevectors corresponding to a monkhorst - pack grid of @xmath21 . in order to calculate the elastic properties of fes@xmath0",
    ", we have used castep package @xcite which is also based on the plane wave pseudopotential method . to obtain well converged parameters ,",
    "we have used a plane wave cut off of 800 ev and monkhorst - pack @xcite grid with a minimum spacing of 0.025 @xmath22 using gga - pbe exchange correlation functional with ultrasoft pseudopotential .",
    "the elastic constants can be computed by calculating the elastic energy as a function of elastic strain .",
    "more specifically , the curvature of the elastic energy as a function of value of a particular type of elastic strain gives the value of a particular combination of elastic constants . by repeating the calculations for adequate number of independent strains ,",
    "we can obtain the required number of independent equations for the elastic constants which can be solved to obtain the values of the independent elastic constants .",
    "for each strain , the coordinates of the ions are fully relaxed keeping the shape of the unit cell corresponding to the given strain intact . after obtaining the single crystal elastic constants , we have calculated polycrystalline properties such as the bulk modulus , shear modulus , sound velocities and debye temperature using the voigt - ruess - hill ( vrh ) @xcite approximation-",
    "see ravindran _",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion on these calculations .    to study the electronic properties , we have used full - potential linear augmented plane wave ( fp - lapw ) method based on first - principles density functional calculations as implemented in the wien2k @xcite .",
    "as it is well known , for the semiconductors and insulators , the electronic band gap calculated using dft with the standard exchange - correlation functionals such as lda and gga is usually about 30 to 40% less when compared to experiments due to self - interaction and lack of the derivative discontinuities of the exchange correction potential with respect to occupation number@xcite . in the present work , we have used a modified gga , known as tran and blaha modified becke johnson potential ( tb - mbj)@xcite , which is found to be quite successful in reproducing the experimental band gaps as compared to standard gga @xcite .",
    "here we have used @xmath23 and @xmath24 monkhorst - pack k - meshes for the self - consistent calculations , resulting in 175 and 176 k - points in the irreducible part of the brillouin zone , respectively for the marcasite and pyrite phases .",
    "spin - orbit coupling has been incorporated in our calculations .",
    "all our calculations are performed using the optimized parameters from the pwscf calculation with an energy convergence up to 10@xmath25 ry per unit cell between the successive iterations .",
    "further , we have calculated the thermopower ( s ) , and @xmath26 using boltztrap@xcite code with well converged ( using as many as 100000 k - points in the brillouin zone ) using the self - consistent calculation , with in the rigid band approximation ( rba ) @xcite and the constant scattering time ( @xmath27 ) approximation ( csta ) . according to the rba approximation , doping",
    "a system does not vary its band structure but varies only the chemical potential , and it is a good approximation for doped semiconductors to calculate the transport properties theoretically when doping level is not very high @xcite . according to csta , the scattering time of the electron is independent of energy and depends on concentration and temperature . the detailed explanation about the csta is given in ref . and the references therein .",
    "it is evident that csta had been quite successful in predicting the thermoelectric properties of many materials in the past @xcite .",
    "the structural phase stability of the marcasite and pyrite phases of fes@xmath0 has been studied to find the ground state of fes@xmath0 at various pressures . as a first step ,",
    "we have performed total energy calculations as a function of volume for both marcasite and pyrite fes@xmath0 structures by varying pressures from -3 gpa to 9 gpa . here , the negative and positive pressures represent respectively expansion and compression of the unit cell . as shown in fig .",
    "2 , the total energy curves clearly show marcasite to be energetically favorable than pyrite with an energy difference of @xmath280.03 ry / atom .",
    "a similar result has been obtained by a recent study on fes@xmath0 using a different numerical implementation @xcite .",
    "even though similar studies exist in the literature , none of them clearly identified marcasite as the ground state of the polymorphic fes@xmath0 . from fig .",
    "2 , we found a possible structural phase transition from marcasite to pyrite fes@xmath0 @xmath280.98 of v / v@xmath29 where v is the theoretical volume and v@xmath29 is the experimental volume . to obtain the transition pressure ,",
    "we have also plotted the enthalpy difference versus pressure which is presented in fig .",
    "3 ( a ) . from this ,",
    "the pressure for marcasite to pyrite phase transition is determined to be 3.7 gpa . as shown in fig .",
    "3 ( b ) , there is a volume collapse @xmath30 which indicates the first order character of the phase transition from marcasite to pyrite structure . in the present study",
    "we specifically address the ground state as well as high pressure properties of marcasite fes@xmath0 which was not reported previously .",
    "it is interesting to note that there are no conspicuous signatures of the marcasite to pyrite transition in the phonon dispersion , raman or ir spectra of marcasite fes@xmath0 at ambient as well as high pressures .",
    "we shall discuss this in more detail in later sections .",
    "the calculated structural properties such as lattice constants , volume , internal parameters ( u and v ) of sulphur and bond lengths of fe - fe , fe - s and s - s for marcasite fes@xmath0 are compared with experiments and other theoretical reports and are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the calculated lattice parameters and volume are in reasonable agreement with the calculations of spagnoli _ et al _ @xcite and sithole _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "the minor differences found when compared with the results of sithole _",
    "et al _ @xcite are due to different parameterizations of the exchange - correlation functional used in their calculations .",
    ".ground state properties of marcasite fes@xmath0 at ambient pressure combined with other experimental and theoretical reports .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the calculated density of states ( dos ) along with the l - projected dos for both the structures are shown in fig .",
    "8(a ) and 8(b ) . in fig .",
    "8(b ) , it is clearly seen that there is a sudden increase in dos at the vbm ( e@xmath31 ) , and this is also quite evident from the low dispersion seen in the band structure ( fig .",
    "7(b ) ) . in the case of marcasite ( fig .",
    "8(a ) ) we find an increase in the dos of valence band upto -0.2 ev , then it dips a little near -0.2 ev , and then increases again .",
    "we find a similar increasing trend in the dos in case of conduction band for both the structures with a small variation in the marcasite .",
    "it is also evident from the above band structure and dos that p - type doping is more favorable for obtaining better thermoelectric properties than n - type doping .",
    "optimized doping level and transport properties are discussed in the succeeding section .",
    "the recent experimental study of lu _ et al _ @xcite reveals that natural minerals are good candidate materials for achieving high thermoelectric efficiency . in view of this",
    ", we have attempted to calculate the thermoelectric properties of both marcasite and pyrite phases of fes@xmath0 . towards this end",
    ", we have calculated the thermopower and electrical conductivity / scattering time ( @xmath11/@xmath27 ) , as a function of carrier concentration and temperature , using the boltzmann transport equation approach as implemented in boltztrap@xcite code .",
    "these properties were calculated at ambient pressure for the marcasite phase and at high pressure for the pyrite phase .",
    "the results are discussed in the following sections .",
    "the thermopower plays a vital role in deciding the performance of the thermoelectric material , the reason being the direct proportionality of the figure of merit to the square of the thermopower ( zt = s@xmath10@xmath11t/@xmath12 ) .",
    "the thermopower calculated using the electronic structure data depends on the carrier concentration and temperature . in view of the constant scattering time approximation that is employed ,",
    "energy dependence of @xmath27 is ignored .",
    "the calculated thermopower as a function of hole and electron concentrations at different temperatures are shown in fig .",
    "9(a ) and 9(b ) . here",
    "we have given the results for 300 k , 400 k and 500 k for marcasite and 700 k , 800 k and 900 k for the pyrite , as marcasite is reported to be stable only till 573 k ( 300 @xmath32c ) , found to exist in mixed state between 573 - 673 k ( 300 - 400 @xmath32c ) and completely transformed to pyrite above 673 k ( 400 @xmath32c ) @xcite .",
    "we observe the thermopower to increase with decreasing carrier concentration for both electron and hole doping which implies absence of bipolar conduction in the optimum concentration region . at low carrier concentrations ( hole concentration of @xmath33 @xmath34 at 900 k for pyrite )",
    ", we can see a decrease in the thermopower which indicates onset of bipolar conduction at those regions .",
    "we also found the pisarenko behavior ( _ i.e. _ logarithmic variation ) in the thermopower , in the range of 10@xmath35 - 10@xmath36 @xmath34 which is an optimum working region for any good thermoelectric material . in this region",
    ", we find the thermopower of marcasite with a hole concentration of 1x10@xmath35 @xmath34 to vary between 550 - 610 @xmath37 v / k for the temperature range 300 k-500 k. in case of the pyrite , the thermopower is higher @xmath38v / k up to temperature @xmath28 800 k , followed by a reduction at @xmath28 900 k due to the bipolar conduction .",
    "the difference between the thermopower values of marcasite and pyrite may be due to difference in effective masses of the carriers near the fermi level of both the structures ( see fig .",
    "7(a ) and 7(b ) ) .",
    "hole doping leads to larger thermopower as compared to electron doping in both the structures .",
    "the computed range of thermopower is in good agreement with the earlier experimental investigation of maria telkes @xcite for both the structures .",
    "this indicates that the marcasite and pyrite phases of fes@xmath0 are good thermoelectric materials with both hole and electron doping , but hole doping is preferred over electron doping .",
    "this is also evident from the fig .",
    "8(b ) as discussed earlier .",
    "apart from this , we can also see that marcasite is favourable for the low temperature(upto 500 k ) thermoelectric applications and pyrite is favorable for the high temperature(upto 900 k ) thermoelectric applications .",
    "the other important factor which influences the thermoelectric figure of merit is the electrical conductivity @xmath11 .",
    "while @xmath11/@xmath27 is an intrinsic property of any material , the relaxation time @xmath27 also depends on the nuances of material preparation . therefore , we first consider variation of @xmath11/@xmath27 with carrier concentration and temperature .",
    "results of our calculation of @xmath39 , as a function of both the electron and hole concentrations for both the structures are shown in fig .",
    "10(a ) and 10(b ) .",
    "we found that there is no significant change in @xmath39 with temperature in the temperature range of our interest when the carrier concentration is varied in the range @xmath40 for both the structures .",
    "we also observe that @xmath39 varies from @xmath41-@xmath42 _ @xmath43 _ for marcasite and from @xmath44-@xmath42 _ @xmath43 _ for the pyrite for the optimum hole concentration at the investigated temperatures .",
    "since no general method exists to calculate microstructure dependent relaxation times of electrons , we are not in a position calculate @xmath45 from first principles .",
    "however , we have attempted to estimate the relaxation times of electrons at a fixed temperature and carrier concentration of the pyrite phase from the limited experimental data available on naturally occurring pyrite@xcite .",
    "we have then used the same relaxation time for the marcasite structure as well , since these two polymorphic phases are closely related . for the naturally occurring pyrite with an electron concentration of 3.3@xmath46 10@xmath47 @xmath34 , the resistivity and thermal conductivity of natural pyrite was found to be of the order of 2.17@xmath46 10@xmath48 _",
    "@xmath49 m@xmath22 _ and 24.89 _ w / m k _ respectively at a temperature of 578 _ k_@xcite .",
    "the corresponding relaxation time @xmath27 is estimated to be 101.1 @xmath46 10@xmath50so that the computed resistivity matches the experimental value . using this relaxation time",
    ", @xmath11 is calculated for various carrier concentrations .",
    "the value of zt thus computed is found to be 0.32 for a concentration 3 @xmath46 10@xmath35 at a temperature of 700k .",
    "similarly we found a zt value of 0.14 for marcasite at a temperature of 300 _ k_. the value of zt can be increased further by reducing the thermal conductivity by resorting to nano - structuring technique@xcite as well as by improving @xmath11 by using phase pure materials .",
    "our theoretical calculations give the guidelines for further experimental investigation in this regard .",
    "in summary , we have reported a theoretical description of the structural transition of natural mineral fes@xmath0 . from this study",
    ", we conclude that the ground state of fes@xmath0 is the marcasite structure under ambient conditions , and it transforms to the pyrite structure at high pressures .",
    "the calculated structural properties such as lattice parameters , internal coordinates of sulphur atoms , bond lengths and bulk modulus at ambient conditions are in good agreement with available experiments and other theoretical reports .",
    "we have also predicted the single crystal and polycrystalline elastic properties and confirm that marcasite fes@xmath0 is mechanically stable at ambient conditions .",
    "our calculations using pressure coefficients of three lattice parameters and single crystal elastic constants confirmed that the marcasite phase is least compressible along the @xmath51- axis .",
    "furthermore , the dynamical stability of marcasite fes@xmath0 is studied by phonon dispersion and the calculated zone centered frequencies at ambient and high pressure are in good agreement with the earlier experiments and theoretical results .",
    "it is interesting to note that the calculated zone centered frequencies and the phonon dispersion up to 5 gpa along different directions do not show any softening under pressure , reflecting the dynamical stability of marcasite fes@xmath0 up to 5 gpa .",
    "a discussion of marcasite to pyrite structural transition is presented based on a detailed comparison of the geometry and energetics of the two structures .",
    "we have also calculated the electronic band gap using semi - local exchange correlation functional tb - mbj and found that both polymorphic structures are indirect band gap semiconductors .",
    "finally , we have calculated thermoelectric properties and find that the thermopower for the high pressure phase is relatively higher compared to the ambient phase .",
    "we also predict that marcasite can be used for low temperature thermoelectric applications , whereas pyrite can be used for the high temperature applications .",
    "we hope that our work on the transport properties will further stimulate the experimentalists for a detailed study of the thermoelectric properties of this interesting mineral .",
