    "we have developed@xcite two simple models for the @xmath0 gluon plasma equation of state , both based on the use of the eigenvalues of the polyakov loop @xmath7 as the natural order parameters of the deconfinement transition in pure gauge theories @xcite .",
    "the first model is obtained by adding a mass @xmath8 to the gauge bosons , and working with the high temperature expansion of the resultant free energy to order @xmath9 .",
    "the result is @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are simple functions of @xmath7@xcite .",
    "the first term , @xmath13 , is precisely the one - loop perturbative result .",
    "our second model is obtained by supposing that there is a natural scale @xmath14 in position space over which color neutrality is enforced .",
    "this leads to @xmath15\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the jacobian associated with haar measure on @xmath0 . in both models , the @xmath17 term , which favors the deconfined phase , dominates for large @xmath18 .",
    "the other term , which favors the confined phase , dominates for small t. confinement is naturally obtained from a uniform distribution of eigenvalues around the unit circle , constrained by the unitary of @xmath7 . in a pure gauge theory , below the deconfinement temperature @xmath19 ,",
    "the eigenvalues are frozen in this uniform distribution .",
    "the deconfinement phase transition results from a conflict between the two terms .",
    "in both models , the deconfining transition is second order for @xmath21 and first order for @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "both models appear to quickly approach a large-@xmath25 limit .",
    "figures 1 - 2 show the pressure @xmath26 and the dimensionless interaction measure @xmath27 for the case of @xmath22 compared with results from lattice simulations@xcite .",
    "since both models involve only a single dimensional parameter , these graphs have no free parameters .",
    "using a transition temperature of @xmath28 for pure @xmath22 gauge theory gives the plausible values @xmath29 and @xmath30fermi .",
    "it is clear that by allowing the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath31 to depend on the temperature , a better fit to lattice data can be obtained at the cost of introducing additional phenomenological parameters .",
    "both models show power law behavior in @xmath32 for sufficiently large @xmath18 , consistent with @xmath33 , compatible with @xmath22 lattice data . in comparison , the bag model@xcite ,",
    "predicts a @xmath34 behavior for @xmath32 , which is ruled out by lattice results . using the information contained in the free energy as a function of @xmath7 , non - equilibrium as well as equilibrium behavior can be explored .",
    "for example , in @xmath22 , the range of temperatures over which metastable behavior occurs can be easily determined .",
