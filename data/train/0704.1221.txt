    "the tippe top is a spinning top , consisting of a section of a sphere fitted with a short , cylindrical rod ( _ the stem _ ) .",
    "one typically sets off the top by making it spin with the stem upwards , which we call , from now on the _ initial spin _ of the top .",
    "when the top is spun on a table , it will turn the stem down towards the table .",
    "when the stem touches the table , the top overturns and starts spinning on the stem .",
    "the overturning motion as we shall see is a transition from an unstable ( relative ) equilibrium to a stable one .",
    "experimentally , it is known that such a transition only occurs when the spin speed exceeds a certain critical value .",
    "let us make things more precise and first describe in some detail the model used throughout this paper .",
    "the tippe top is assumed to be a spherical rigid body with its center of mass @xmath0 off the geometrical center of the sphere with radius @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , we assume that this eccentric sphere has a mass distribution which is axially symmetric about the axis through the center of mass @xmath2 and the geometrical center @xmath3 of the sphere .",
    "the tippe top is subject to a holonomic constraint since we only consider motions of the tippe top on a horizontal plane .",
    "an important observation is that the system has an integral of motion , regardless of the model of the friction force that is used .",
    "this integral is called the _ jellet _ @xmath4 and is proportional to the initial spin @xmath5 ( equation  ) . for the sake of completeness we mention here that a nonholonomic model ( rolling without slipping ) for the tippe top is not appropriate , since the equations of motion then allow two more integrals of motion ( the energy and the routh - integral ) that prohibit the typical turning motion , cf .",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "we will choose the friction force to be linearly dependent on the slip velocity of the contact point @xmath6 of the top and the horizontal plane .    in earlier works @xcite conditions of stability for asymptotic states of the tippe top",
    "were retrieved by the lyapunov function method starting with the newton equations of motion .",
    "we take a different approach to the problem .",
    "our goal is to describe the behaviour of the tippe top in terms of lagrangian variables and thereby classify its asymptotic motions as function of non - dimensional ( physical ) parameters @xmath7 , the _ inertia ratio _ and @xmath8 , the _ eccentricity _ of the sphere and of the value the jellet @xmath4 . as main novelty , we show that by ignoring the translational velocity of the center of mass in the friction law , the lagrangian formulation of the dynamics of the tippe top allows a restriction to a system on @xmath9 which is amenable to routhian reduction  @xcite .",
    "the reduced system allows a rather simple stability analysis of the relative equilibria based on the relationship of the value of the jellet s integral @xmath4 and the tumbling angle @xmath10 , see below . through the routhian reduction we retrieve a simple stability criterium which leads to the same conclusions as in @xcite .",
    "the hypothesis of neglecting translational effects is similar to the one made by bou - rabee et al .",
    "@xcite . they motivated it by reasoning that for all possible asymptotic states ( the relative equilibria of the system ) the velocity of the center of mass is zero @xcite , and , for this reason , in a neighborhood of these solutions the translational friction can be neglected . in  @xcite the dynamics of the spherical tippe top with small friction",
    "has been studied without such an approximation and a full analysis of the asymptotic long term dynamics of the system is given in terms of the jellet and the eccentricity of the sphere and inertia ratio .",
    "remarkable is the fact that the stability results obtained by means of the routhian reduction procedure fully coincides with the results of  @xcite .",
    "this justifies a - posteriori the approximation assumption in the friction force and shows that it accurately describes the behavior of the tippe top .",
    "the main result of this paper is summarized in the following theorem , also compare with @xcite .",
    "[ mainthm ] in the approximation of negligible translational effects , a spinning eccentric sphere on an horizontal ( perfectly hard ) surface subject to a sliding friction is reducible with a routhian reduction procedure  @xcite .",
    "the relative equilibria of the reduced system are precisely the steady states of the original system .",
    "they are purely rolling solutions and except for the trivial state of rest , they are of three types :    * ( non - inverted ) vertically spinning top with center of mass straight below the geometric center ; * ( inverted ) vertically spinning top with center of mass straight above the geometric center ; * intermediate spinning top , the top precesses about a vertical while spinning about its axle and rolling over the plane without gliding .",
    "the existence and stability type of these relative equilibria only depend on the inertia ratio @xmath11 , the eccentricity of the sphere @xmath12 and the jellet invariant @xmath4 .",

    "as it was pointed out before , the tippe top is constrained to move on a horizontal plane .",
    "this holonomic constraint is expressed by @xmath44 .",

    "the eccentric sphere model does not accurately model the contact effects of the tippe top stem .",
    "however , it does describe the fundamental phenomenon of the over - turning . for the sake of completeness we remark that as soon as the top rises to spin on its stem , it behaves as a ` normal ' spinning top with rounded peg",

    "note that our model also does not describe the peculiar ` hycaro ' tippe tops by prof .",
    "t.  tokieda  , which need a non - axisymmetric asymmetric mass distribution .",
    "these tippe tops have a ` preferred direction ' meaning that the top would flip over only if spun in the preferred direction with a certain initial spin , and , no matter what the initial spin is , it would just continue rotating around the rest position when spun the other way round .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for a detailed analysis when elasticity properties of the horizontal surface and tippe top are taken into account .",
    "their model allows for jumps of the tippe top on the horizontal surface ( that we assumed to be rigid ) .",
    "finally , we mention that we do not debate over the issue of whether transitions sliding - rolling and rolling - sliding occur in the motion of an eccentric sphere on a flat surface .",
    "we chose to concentrate on the sliding model only , because we were interested in capturing the ` overturning ' phenomenon which can not occur under the non - holonomic constraint of pure rolling .",
    "we refer the interested reader to @xcite for a discussion of the topic and to @xcite for an analysis of the motion of the rolling eccentric sphere also called the routh s sphere .",
    "it was first shown by jellet  @xcite by an approximate argument , and later proved by routh  @xcite that the system , even if dissipative , has a conserved quantity : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the angular momentum of the tippe top about the center of mass .",
    "we prove this by using euler equations which govern the evolution of the angular momentum @xmath79 the total time derivative of @xmath4 then becomes : @xmath80 straightforward calculations show that jellet s constant can be written as @xmath81 we emphasize once more that the jellet s constant is an exact constant of motion for the tippe top whether or not there is slipping and independent of the expression for @xmath82 .",
    "as we will explain later , it is this constant that to some extent controls the motion of the spinning top .",
    "indeed , it allows a routhian reduction procedure ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : routhreduction ] ) , resulting in relatively simple reduced equations from which we are able to recover in full detail the stability properties of the steady states . in the specific case that @xmath13 , the jellet is proportional to @xmath83 , the spin about the @xmath34-axis . since one typically sets off the tippe top at an angle @xmath84 , one can say that the jellet is proportional to the initial spin @xmath5 .",
    "note that the spin at @xmath14 has an opposite sign to the initial spin @xmath5 , meaning that , relative to a body fixed frame , the spin is reversed when the tippe top fulfills a complete inversion .",
    "there is a rotational symmetry for which the jellet is the associated first integral .",
    "the action of @xmath85 on @xmath86 can be defined as a simultaneous rotation about @xmath87 over the angle @xmath88 and about @xmath89 over the angle @xmath90 , where @xmath91 ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "noether s theorem is applicable in this situation since the work of the friction force at the point of contact vanishes under this action .",
    "note that the total energy of the spinning top is @xmath92 is in general not conserved . here",
    "@xmath93 is the kinetic energy with its rotational and translational part , @xmath94 is the potential energy .",

    "it follows that dissipation is due to friction .",
    "it turns out that , if we consider an approximation of the friction law , the resulting generalized force moments assume a form that allows us to apply a routhian reduction procedure , see  @xcite and appendix  [ app : routh ] . in turn , using the reduced equations we are able to study in full detail the stability properties of the tippe top which confirm the results obtained in  @xcite , and also recover those of  @xcite .",
    "we now ignore translational effects in the friction force , i.e. we assume that all terms in @xmath100 containing @xmath101 and @xmath102 are neglected .",
    "typically this approximation is justified by noting that for all steady states the velocity of the center of mass is zero , and that in a neighborhood of the steady states it can be neglected . in our situation , it allows to restrict ourselves to a system on @xmath9 which is reducible using routh s procedure .",
    "it is easily seen that within this approximation , if we study the lagrangian system on @xmath9 determined by @xmath103 with @xmath104 , then we essentially study the entire approximated system .",
    "indeed , any solution @xmath105 to this lagrangian system will determine the remaining unknowns @xmath106 as solutions to the following system of time - dependent second order differential equations : @xmath107 our next step in the reduction procedure is to consider the lagrangian system @xmath108 on @xmath9 with generalized force form @xmath109 and perform a simple coordinate transformation , determined by @xmath110 the lagrangian @xmath108 and the force @xmath109 then become @xmath111 where it is understood that @xmath112 is a function of @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the main reason for writing @xmath108 and @xmath109 in this form is the fact that @xmath115 is a cyclic coordinate and that @xmath116 .",
    "indeed , recall that jellet integral was associated to the symmetry determined by the vector field @xmath117 , or in the above introduced coordinate system by the vector field @xmath118 .",
    "in particular , we have made the symmetry generator into a coordinate vector field , and this ensures that we can apply the routhian reduction procedure  ( @xcite and appendix  [ app : routh ] ) , provided the coefficients of @xmath109 do not depend on @xmath115 .",
    "this is the case since we neglected the terms in the velocity of the center of mass .",
    "the conserved quantity associated with the cyclic coordinate is precisely the jellet integral : @xmath119 the latter equality implies that @xmath120 the routhian reduction procedure defines a lagrangian system @xmath121 with two degrees of freedom @xmath122 ( here every instance of @xmath114 in @xmath123 is replaced using  ) .",
    "the reduced equations of motion are then given by @xmath124 where it is understood that   is used to eliminate @xmath114 in @xmath112 .",
