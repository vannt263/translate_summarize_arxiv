    "type  ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) have a well - established history as standardized candles for cosmological distance measurements . in the late 1990s ,",
    "studies of high - redshift type  ia supernovae led to the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe  a remarkable and paradigm - shifting discovery @xcite . before standardization is applied , among `` normal '' sne  ia there exists a dispersion of approximately 40% @xcite .",
    "the physical source of this variation is not fully understood , but a number of methods have been developed to reduce this natural dispersion @xcite .",
    "the most established approach uses the light curve width and color as standardization parameters .",
    "sne  ia with broader light curves tend to be brighter @xcite . to some degree",
    ", the color correction seems able to account for extrinsic reddening due to dust and intrinsic color differences ( presumably arising from differences in the physics of the supernova explosion ) . with these corrections ,",
    "the variation in brightness drops to @xmath2% , allowing precision cosmology measurements using large samples of sne  ia .    since the discovery of the accelerating expansion , many large type  ia supernova programs have been undertaken , resulting in sufficiently large data sets that statistical errors have become subdominant to systematic errors @xcite .",
    "much of the effort in reducing systematic errors has focused on the flux calibration of sne  ia at low - redshift relative to those at high redshift since this error is relatively large and there are clear , though technically challenging , means of addressing it @xcite .",
    "if the remaining dispersion of 15% were due to a statistically homogeneous process , then correction of flux calibration issues would clear the way for more large sn surveys using conventional light curve width and color standardization . however , there is ample evidence that the remaining dispersion is not statistically homogeneous .",
    "only relatively recently have significant biases correlated with host galaxy environment been uncovered , and the physical explanation for these observed correlations is still under debate @xcite .",
    "the size of these environmental biases is @xmath3% , quite large relative to the standardized brightness dispersion , yet correction for these biases still leaves a significant dispersion ( e.g. , @xmath3% in @xcite ) that might hide additional astrophysical biases .",
    "the diversity of sne  ia spectral features , which have been ascribed to subpopulations of otherwise normal sne  ia , also contributes significant systematic errors that are also reflected in the standardize brightness dispersion @xcite .",
    "dust correction could also introduce systematic errors .",
    "there is not only evidence for a variety in the extinction curves of the dust itself ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , but also for a strong interplay between sn spectral features and the lightcurve `` color '' appropriate for applying extinction corrections @xcite .",
    "suppression of such astrophysical systematics requires separation of intrinsic supernova explosion differences from those of dust .",
    "however , disentangling the two has proven a major challenge due to the lack of a clearly identifiable set of observational indicators .",
    "thus , while decreasing the dispersion in standardized brightnesses has a clear statistical payoff , its more important impact is in the _ implicit _ suppression of systematic errors .",
    "techniques to decrease the brightness dispersion continue to be developed .",
    "various spectral metrics have been tried , mostly using spectra near maximum light .",
    "for instance , @xcite were able to achieve a @xmath4  mag dispersion using a one - parameter spectral correction .",
    "this is notable in that this one parameter seems to have captured much of the variation from dust , intrinsic color , and whatever physics is encoded in the lightcurve width ( likely total mass ; @xcite ) .",
    "another approach has been to attempt to evade dust extinction altogether and to therefore focus on restframe nir wavelengths .",
    "theoretical modeling suggests that the restframe nir also may have less intrinsic brightness variation @xcite .",
    "recent filter - photometry results demonstrate standardization as good as @xmath5  mag for nearby sne  ia ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these types of studies still do not resolve the fact that some of the observed color arises from dust while some is intrinsic color from the specifics of the explosion .    using new more detailed measurements of type  ia supernova time series obtained by the nearby supernova factory ( snfactory ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we are able to go further in exploring standardization techniques using spectra across all phases .",
    "a time series of spectrophotometric observations offers a look at the physics of the explosion through the expanding photosphere .",
    "each phase observation is a snapshot of the elements visible at that stage of the expansion , and their absorption - weighted velocities .",
    "if two time series were to match in flux at all wavelengths and times , they would presumably represent the same physical explosion process .",
    "use of such differential techniques is a well - established experimental method for reducing systematics and increasing sensitivity .",
    "we call two such time series `` twin supernovae '' .    a distinct advantage of this twin supernova methodology is the ability to separately account for color arising from dust extinction . the relative amount of dust extinction affecting two spectrophotometric time series can be fit and removed .",
    "any remaining color difference can be ascribed to intrinsic color differences ( minus any intrinsic color behavior that happens to exactly mimic the dust color - extinction relation )",
    ". two objects that are true twins would have the same intrinsic color and the same spectral features at all times . for pairs of supernovae",
    "that are twins , we expect a very small brightness difference , as they represent the same explosion physics .",
    "if this is indeed the case , cosmology analyses could treat twin sne  ia as true standard candles , with no lightcurve width or intrinsic color corrections necessary .    for this analysis",
    ", we use spectrophotometric time series with host - galaxy subtractions that are unique to the snfactory .",
    "much of this dataset is from untargeted searches in the hubble flow , and thus not only mimics the subtypes of type  ia supernovae that are found in high - redshift searches , but also is in the redshift regime where host - galaxy peculiar velocity uncertainties are substantially less than the existing dispersion in standardized sne  ia brightnesses .",
    "ideally , a dataset designed for a twin supernova analysis would consist of frequent observations , to ensure that the analysis captures relevant spectral feature changes .",
    "the snfactory dataset typically has spectrophotometric observations every 2 to 3 nights .",
    "section  [ sec : data ] describes the snfactory sample used for the twins analysis reported here .",
    "since measurement of dispersion is highly dependent on the tails of the residual distribution , we were careful to finalize the sample selection criteria and analysis methodology before examining the brightness scatter in order to remove the possibility that analysis choices would artificially suppress the dispersion .",
    "section  [ sec : interp ] then introduces the techniques we developed to directly compare the supernovae observations to each other .",
    "the analysis is discussed in section  [ sec : rank ] ; we discuss both a near - maximum analysis , and a weighted full time series analysis . in section  [ sec : deltam ] the resulting dispersions for each of these analyses is determined . in section",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we compare the results to other standardization techniques , and discuss the application of the twins method to new high - redshift sne  ia , before presenting our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "here we describe the data set used for this analysis . we include details of the observations , a short discussion of the time series interpolation method since it enters into the selection process , and the criteria and outcome of the final sample selection .",
    "steps needed to prepare the data for analysis are also described .",
    "the spectrophotometric time series used in this study were obtained by the nearby supernova factory using the supernova integral field spectrograph ( snifs , * ? ? ?",
    "snifs consists of a high - throughput wide - band pure - lenslet integral field spectrograph ( ifs ,   la tiger ;  * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a photometric channel to image the field in the vicinity of the ifs for atmospheric transmission monitoring simultaneous with spectroscopy , and an acquisition / guiding channel .",
    "the ifs possesses a fully - filled @xmath6 spectroscopic field of view subdivided into a grid of @xmath7 spatial elements , a dual - channel spectrograph covering 32005200    and 510010000    simultaneously , and an internal calibration unit ( continuum and arc lamps ) .",
    "snifs is mounted on the south bent cassegrain port of the university of hawaii 2.2  m telescope on mauna kea , and is operated remotely .",
    "observations primarily targeted sne  ia that , at the time , were expected to be at or before maximum light and in the redshift range @xmath8 , with a nominal cadence of 23 nights .",
    "for spectra near maximum , the median signal - to - noise over all sne and restframe wavelengths 33008600   is @xmath9 per 1000  km  s@xmath10 interval . by comparison , this signal - to - noise is @xmath11 for spectra between 2025 days after maximum . for a typical near - maximum spectrum , this",
    "signal - to - noise varies from @xmath3 near the wavelength extremes of the two spectrograph channels to @xmath12 near their central wavelengths .",
    "multiple spectrophotometric standard stars were regularly observed each night in order to measure the instrument calibration and atmospheric extinction .",
    "parallel imaging was obtained so that it could be employed to remove dimming due to clouds on nights that proved to be non - photometric . roughly a year or more after the nominal date of maximum ,",
    "final reference observations were obtained in order to subtract the host galaxy and sn signal .",
    "spectra of all targets were reduced using the dedicated snfactory data reduction pipeline , similar to that presented in   4 of @xcite .",
    "a brief discussion of the software pipeline is presented in @xcite and is updated in @xcite .",
    "detailed discussions of the flux calibration and host - galaxy subtraction are provided in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "other spectral and lightcurve results from these data have been presented in @xcite .",
    "for the twins analysis it is necessary to compare candidate twin supernovae at the same phases .",
    "realistic observing programs are unable to generate an observation of each sn on every night , so such a comparison requires an estimated spectrum using data at other phases .",
    "the quality of such an interpolation affects which spectral time series are appropriate for this study .",
    "here we briefly discuss the method we have implemented .",
    "we have chosen to use gaussian process regression @xcite to predict sn time series at desired phases .",
    "to take advantage of all the available data , in comparing sn@xmath13 to sn@xmath14 , we first predict sn@xmath13 at the phases of sn@xmath14 and then vice versa . each pair is given a ranking ( discussed in section  [ sec : nearmaxtwinness ] ) by combining the results of both directions .    a gaussian process ( gp ) gives a non - parametric reconstruction of a function from data .",
    "it requires the selection of a mean function , which is an initial estimate of the average supernova flux at all phases and wavelengths .",
    "we use the spectral template of @xcite for our mean function .",
    "the end result is not highly dependent on the choice of this mean function , so long as a reasonable function is used , and the gaps in data are not large compared to the typical length scale of the gp mean function .",
    "the gaussian process uses a kernel to specify the correlation lengths in wavelength and time . for the current analysis , the parameters of the kernel , called hyperparameters",
    ", are optimized separately for each sn time series .",
    "once these hyperparameters are found , both the predicted sn flux and an estimate of the flux uncertainty can be generated for any phase of interest .",
    "appendix [ sec : gp_params ] details the kernel and hyperparameters used in this analysis .",
    "the gp prediction for two supernovae is shown in figure  [ fig : loo ] . in this figure ,",
    "the upper panels show the wavelength - averaged flux for each phase ( which is close to the bolometric lightcurve ) .",
    "the lower left panel shows an example of a successful series of predictions : for each sn , we remove each epoch in turn and redo the gp model and predictions . the removed spectrum , in black , is compared to the gp prediction for its date , in color .",
    "( we call this a `` leave - one - out test . '' ) the fact that the removed spectra can all be faithfully reproduced indicates that the gp is able to predict this supernova s spectra at any phase accurately .",
    "this was the case for the vast majority ( @xmath1583% ) of the supernovae .",
    "the rarer exceptions , as shown in the right panels , are discussed in the following section .",
    "lll initial sample & 80 & 833 + phase @xmath16 & 80 & 683 + first phase @xmath17 days & 70 & - + phase gap @xmath18 days & 67 & - + @xmath19 spectra & 66 & 591 + gp prediction quality & 55 & 468 + full time series & 55 & 468 + near - maximum & 49 & 420 +      demonstration of a reduction in dispersion of the standardized peak magnitudes of sne  ia requires a sufficient number of sne  ia to measure that dispersion with an uncertainty of @xmath150.01  mag .",
    "this would require at least @xmath20  sne  ia , if the dispersion is @xmath21 0.1   mag , as seen for the best standardization techniques discussed above , and if the accuracy on the dispersion scales as @xmath22 .",
    "thus we commenced this analysis as soon as the available nearby supernova factory sample reached this approximate size . once the sample was selected , it was frozen and no further supernovae were added to the sample , as required for a blind analysis . here",
    "we present the details of the sample selection .    as the goal of this study is to measure a dispersion that we anticipate",
    "could be much smaller than the canonical @xmath2% , it is important to only include sne  ia having sufficient sensitivity . broadly speaking ,",
    "this requires good signal - to - noise , accurate flux calibration and host galaxy subtraction , and temporal sampling sufficient to avoid gp prediction errors .",
    "host galaxy peculiar velocities must be a small fraction of the hubble expansion velocities so that redshift is a reliable indicator of relative distances .",
    "in general , we apply the types of cuts typical of sn cosmology analyses using lightcurve - based standardization since these are what we will be comparing to .",
    "the bulk of the snfactory dataset is in the range @xmath8 .",
    "comparison of two sne  ia at @xmath23 having peculiar velocities of 300  km / s will result in a uncertainty on their relative brightnesses of 14% , so we must exclude the handful of sne  ia below this redshift .",
    "we also set an upper limit of @xmath24 since the few sne above this redshift were observed with much lower s / n than the main program .",
    "next , we require spectra to have high - quality flux calibration , as described in @xcite .",
    "this calibration is provided by observations of multiple spectrophotometric standard stars during the night , and on non - photometric nights , a measurement of the loss due to clouds using the snifs parallel imaging channel .",
    "at least two photometric nights per spectral time series were required in order to ensure adequate reference brightnesses from the parallel imager .",
    "we also required final reference datacubes taken under conditions of good seeing , and sufficient for the host galaxy subtraction method presented in @xcite to converge to a proper solution over the entire portion of sky and host galaxy sampled by each spectral time series . at the time of the start of this analysis , 80 of our sne  ia satisfied these requirements .    for cosmological analyses where lightcurves are fit using templates or a model ,",
    "it is typical to require at least 5 lightcurve points , with the first starting no later than 6  nights after @xmath25-band maximum light ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "such lenient requirements are possible because the templates and models are very stiff and so do not require that all phases be strongly constrained . because we do not rely on templates or models , and must produce gp predicted spectra for epochs other than those directly observed , our coverage cuts must be more stringent .",
    "we perform initial fits with the salt2.4 lightcurve fitter @xcite to bvr photometry synthesized from the spectrophotometry in order to determine the phases for our observations , and then require that the first spectrum be no later than 2.5  nights after maximum .",
    "this requirement results in only very small extrapolation to maximum for sne  ia whose coverage begins after maximum .",
    "we restrict our study to spectra taken before 25  nights after maximum ; after this phase snfactory switched to a much less frequent follow - up cadence .",
    "the final cut on coverage is that there can be no gap in coverage greater than 10  nights .",
    "though the nominal snfactory cadence was 23  nights prior to a phase of 25 days , occasionally bad weather , proximity to the moon , or instrument or telescope operational issues would conspire to create significant gaps .",
    "we require a minimum of 5 epochs passing these cuts .",
    "after these cuts on coverage , 66 sne  ia remain .",
    "the above coverage cuts are sufficient for eliminating cases where gp prediction would be strongly suspect , however in a blind analysis we would not be able to further reject sne traced to bad gp predictions after unblinding , so we deemed it prudent to inspect the predictions more closely while still blinded .",
    "first , we examined the gp predictions for visual quality .",
    "we required that the wavelength - averaged gp predictions ( the upper panels of figure  [ fig : loo ] ) be smooth as a function of phase .",
    "we also performed a leave - one - out test as described in section  [ sec : interp ] .",
    "for supernovae that fail the leave - one - out test , we drop the problematic epoch .",
    "if it is not possible to drop the epoch and pass both the leave - one - out test and previous requirements , we drop the supernova all together .",
    "two cases fell below the minimum epoch requirement after this procedure , demonstrating that the temporal distribution is important when there is a small numbers of epochs .",
    "six cases had gp hyperparameters that were not stable under the leave - one - out test , while three others were on the edge of acceptability but rejected as a precaution .",
    "figure  [ fig : loo ] shows an example of one supernova that passes these cuts , and an example of another one with similar coverage that fails .",
    "we are left with a final sample of 55 sne after this last gp prediction robustness check . for the near - maximum analysis discussed in section",
    "[ sec : nearmaxtwinness ] , we require a spectrum within 2.5  nights of maximum in addition to the previous data quality cuts . for that analysis , this leaves a final sample of 49 sne .",
    "the median signal - to - noise of the final sample is @xmath26 per 1000  km  s@xmath10 interval for spectra near maximum ( calculated as in section [ sec : obs ] ) , and decreases to a median of @xmath2 per 1000  km  s@xmath10 interval for spectra at 2025 days after maximum .",
    "note that all of these criteria are applied to properties of the observations , not of the supernovae themselves , so this does not bias the selection towards any particular subpopulation of sne . additionally , in order to avoid inadvertent bias , the sn selection methodology was decided upon and implemented before the analysis results were unblinded .",
    "the number of supernovae and spectra remaining after each stage of cuts is summarized in table  [ tab : cuts ] .",
    "the resulting sample of supernovae has properties that are typical of sne  ia used in cosmology analyses .",
    "the salt2.4 @xmath27 and @xmath28 distributions for both of these final datasets are shown in figure  [ fig : salt_dist ] .",
    "the @xmath27 distribution is roughly gaussian with the unit dispersion expected from the @xmath27 definition .",
    "the color distribution is a positively - skewed gaussian , as expected  the result of both intrinsic and foreground dust contributions .      as a further safeguard against inadvertent bias ,",
    "the dataset has been divided into training and validation subsamples .",
    "the training and validation subsamples were constructed to have similar distributions in lightcurve parameters and host - galaxy properties .",
    "we performed all of the initial exploration only on the training sample .",
    "when the analysis was finalized , it was applied to the validation sample to act as an independent test and ensure the result was not simply tuned to the training sample .",
    "of the 55 sne that pass the cuts , 28 are in the training sample , while 27 are in the validation sample . for the near - maximum analysis , 24 are in the training sample , while 25 are in the validation sample . for the full sample ,",
    "there are 1309 independent pairs of sne matching our requirements in the full time series sample and 1009 pairs in the near - maximum sample .",
    "prior to analysis all spectra are first corrected for galactic extinction based on the @xcite dust map , as provided by the nasa extragalactic database . because the snfactory program specifically avoided sne with large galactic extinction ,",
    "these corrections are small and the uncertainties associated with this correction are negligible .",
    "next , in order to compare spectra , we shift the spectra of all sne to a common arbitrary redshift in both brightness and wavelength .",
    "the redshifts used for this purpose are taken from @xcite .",
    "brightnesses are brought to a common system assuming a @xmath29cdm cosmology with @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the specific choice of cosmology is not important since we are working at low redshift where the expansion is linear . along with this shift to a common redshift",
    ", we bin the spectra into 1000 km / s bins from 3300 to 8600 .",
    "this gives a total of 288 bins per spectrum ( a resolution of r  @xmath32 ) .",
    "with our selection of supernovae completed , we develop a method for pairing the supernovae and ranking those pairings , from good twins to non - twins .",
    "this method is developed on the training half of the sample before unblinding the results , and then applied to the full sample .",
    "for the first analysis in this paper , we calculate the twinness using only the spectrum with phase closest to maximum for each sn . for each sn in the near - maximum sample",
    ", we compare this spectrum with the gp prediction of every other supernova at that spectrum s phase .",
    "the goal in comparing supernovae to each other is to find pairs that are spectroscopically similar .",
    "any such pairs would be considered `` twins . '' for our definition of twinness , we choose to use what is effectively a @xmath33 fit with an error floor .",
    "we fit for extrinsic differences between the two supernovae being compared , and call the resulting pseudo-@xmath33 the `` twinness '' .",
    "mathematically , we define twinness as follows : @xmath34 ^ 2}{\\sigma^2_a(p_i , \\lambda_j)+ \\alpha^2(\\lambda_j)~\\sigma^2_b(p_i , \\lambda_j ) + ( \\gamma~f_a(p_i , \\lambda_j))^2 } \\label{eqn : xi}\\ ] ]    where @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) are the data flux ( variance ) of sn@xmath13 and @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) are the gp - predicted flux ( variance ) of sn@xmath14 .",
    "@xmath39 is the number of degrees of freedom , which is equal to 286 for this analysis ( 288 wavelength bins with 2 fit parameters ) .",
    "this equation is only defined for a single phase @xmath40 . @xmath41",
    "represent the different wavelength bins , and the sum is over all bins .",
    "a definition of twinness should be made independent of extrinsic dust reddening since it is not a property of the supernova itself .",
    "to take dust extinction into account we use the parameter @xmath42 , which is defined as follows : @xmath43 where the scale factor @xmath44 captures any remaining overall brightness difference .",
    "@xmath45 captures a cardelli - like color difference , with @xmath46 and @xmath47 defined in @xcite .",
    "@xmath48 is fixed to 3.1 for the initial analysis , and 2.8 is used for a later analysis variant .    for each pair of supernovae , @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    "are free parameters fit by minimizing the twinness , @xmath49 .",
    "twinness fits are performed in both directions , with the gp - prediction of sn@xmath14 at the phase of sn@xmath13 and then the gp prediction of sn@xmath13 at the phase of sn@xmath14 .",
    "we perform the fits separately because the different phase sampling of the two lightcurves will result in different gp predictions depending on the direction of the comparison .",
    "we find that the two values of @xmath49 rarely differ by more than @xmath50 . for each sn pair , the two values of @xmath49 and the two values of @xmath45 are each averaged .",
    "similarly a single value for @xmath44 is derived as the geometric mean : @xmath51    the remaining parameter in equation  [ eqn : xi ] is @xmath52 , representing an empirically - determined error floor . without this term , the definition of @xmath49 will favor pairs of lower signal - to - noise sne and disfavor high signal - to - noise sne having even minor spectral differences . @xmath44 and @xmath45 are initially fit for each pair with @xmath53 .",
    "we then introduce a finite @xmath52 in the final twinness fit so that different pairs can be compared to each other without a strong dependence on their signal - to - noise .",
    "we tested the addition of error floors from @xmath54 to 0.20 in steps of 0.02 on the training sample .",
    "we found that @xmath55 produced a ranking of pairs for which the best 50 pairs had a signal - to - noise distribution most similar ( evaluated using a kolmogorov - smirnov test ) to that of the full training set .",
    "these @xmath56 values give an order to the pairs from `` best pairs '' to `` worst pairs '' .",
    "figure  [ fig : twin ] shows both a randomly chosen pair out of the best 10% of ordered pairs and a randomly chosen pair out of the worst 50% of ordered pairs .",
    "the level of spectral agreement for the good pair , shown in the left panel , is impressive , much better than current theoretical models of supernova explosions are able to achieve ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the bad twin example illustrates the lack of spectral agreement in the non - twins regime .",
    "note that , while we show the data at all phases , for the near - maximum analysis the twinness value was calculated using only the spectra closest to maximum .",
    "since our data are spectrophotometric , @xmath44 represents the ratio of the absolute brightnesses of the two supernovae .",
    "@xmath44 corresponds to a magnitude difference of : @xmath57 if @xmath44 is 1 , the supernovae have a magnitude difference of zero . the @xmath56 , @xmath58 and @xmath45 values for each pairing of these supernovae are shown in appendix  [ sec : full_data ] . the @xmath45 values are consistent with differences between salt2 colors , shown in figure [ fig : salt_dist ] , with a pearson correlation coefficient of 0.90 .      as a variant of this analysis",
    ", we also define and calculate values for a twinness metric that operates on the full spectral time series , rather than just the spectrum closest to maximum light .",
    "unfortunately , implementation errors were found in this full time series analysis after unblinding that had to be fixed after unblinding .",
    "although we ran this method with only those specific errors fixed , we nevertheless do not consider our results on the full spectral time series to be blinded .",
    "since the implementation errors are unrelated to any properties of sne , this portion of the analysis is unlikely to be biased despite not being blind .    in order to make the most of the information from different phases ,",
    "it is necessary to determine the best relative weights for each phase .",
    "the full covariance matrix between all measurements in both phase and wavelength would be ideal for this purpose , but we do not have a way to measure this covariance matrix directly . as an approximation",
    ", we estimate @xmath58 at each phase using the method described for the near - maximum sample , and we calculate the covariance matrix @xmath59 between these estimates of @xmath58 .",
    "we then take a mean of the pseudo-@xmath33 values from equation  [ eqn : xi ] weighted by this covariance matrix to generate an overall pseudo-@xmath33 function , as follows : @xmath60 which we then minimize .",
    "here @xmath61 is the same as in equation  [ eqn : xi ] , but without the @xmath39 term ( the @xmath39 term in equation [ eqn : upweighting ] is now @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the number of phases used , 288 is the number of wavelength bins and 2 is the number of fit parameters ) .",
    "@xmath59 represents the covariance of the dispersion in brightness between phases @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "application of this equation relies on the ability to calculate the matrix , @xmath59 , which is actually a two dimensional function since all of the different supernovae were measured at different phases .",
    "thus , it is necessary to evaluate this function for arbitrary @xmath40 and @xmath66 .",
    "the details of estimating this matrix are somewhat technical , and can be found in appendix  [ sec : weightcov ] . from the methodology given there , @xmath59 is calculated and used to execute fits to minimize @xmath56 in each direction and thereby obtain a single value of @xmath44 and @xmath45 per pairing , as before .",
    "having completed the ordering of supernova pairs , we can assess the extent to which more twin - like pairs ( those with low @xmath56 ) have more similar brightnesses . in this section",
    "we describe the measurement of relative brightnesses and the results for the near - maximum and full spectral time series cases .",
    "we then describe consistency checks that were performed to validate and better understand the results .",
    "recall that when comparing one supernova to another we fit for a scale factor , @xmath44 , which we convert into a brightness difference @xmath58 . the uncertainty on this brightness difference",
    "is determined from the uncertainty on the fit of @xmath44 , and external uncertainties due to both the host - galaxy peculiar velocities ( we assume a 300 km / s uncertainty ) , and the per - spectrum random gray calibration inferred from standard star measurements @xcite : @xmath67    where @xmath68 note that even with the low redshift cut - off we have imposed , the fit uncertainties ( @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) are subdominant to the peculiar velocity uncertainties , which comprise roughly 80% of the measurement error budget .     near - maximum @xmath56 distribution for @xmath71 . due to the long tail of the @xmath56 distribution , we work with the percentile in @xmath56 instead of the raw value itself . left : conversion between @xmath56 and @xmath56 percentile .",
    "right : histogram of the near - maximum @xmath56 twinness values . , scaledwidth=75.0% ]      with these considerations in mind , the distribution of near - maximum twinness values @xmath56 for @xmath71 is shown in figure  [ fig : f3022 ] .",
