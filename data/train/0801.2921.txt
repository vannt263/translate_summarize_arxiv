    "it is impossible to maintain the slope under the physical requirements that @xmath66 increases and @xmath64 decrease simultaneously with increasing @xmath16 because all of the three parameters work in the same direction - decrease the slope .",

    "the dashed line shows that the excess resistance grows approximately as @xmath96 in this case .",
    "the abrupt appearance of the excess qp resistance is a mere reflection of the abrupt opening of the superconducting gap at @xmath5 .",

    "has caused a considerable confusion , a large part of which has been caused by a series of publications by v.zavaritsky @xcite , in which he `` explained '' the non - linearity of intrinsic tunneling characteristics by assuming that there is no intrinsic tunneling .",
    "the irrelevance of this model to our subject was discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "a certain confusion might be also caused by a large spread in @xmath69 , reported by different groups @xcite .",
    "for the sake of clarity it should be emphasized that those measurements were made on samples of different geometries .",
    "it is clear that @xmath69 depends strongly on the geometry @xcite , e.g. , @xmath69 can be much larger in suspended junctions with poor thermal link to the substrate @xcite than in the case when both top and bottom surfaces of the junctions are well thermally anchored to the heat bath @xcite . for mesa structures similar to those used in this study ( a few @xmath99 in - plane size , containing @xmath100 ijj ) ,",

    "data from ref.@xcite , width=364 ]    how self - heating _ can _ distort the ivc s of josephson junctions is obvious : since self - heating rises the effective @xmath16 it may affect the ivc only via @xmath3dependent parameters . there are three such parameters : the quasiparticle resistance , the superconducting switching @xcite current and the superconducting gap",
    ". they will affect the ivc s of bi-2212 mesas , containing several stacked josephson junctions , in the following manner :    the consecutive increase of @xmath16 upon sequential switching of ijj s from the superconducting to the resistive state will distort the periodicity of quasiparticle branches . each consecutive qp branch will have a smaller qp resistance ( smaller @xmath70 at given @xmath45 ) and smaller switching current , see the discussion in refs . @xcite .",

    "the robustness of the measured gap with respect to self - heating is caused by a flat @xmath3dependence of the superconducting gap at @xmath110 .",
    "if self - heating reaches @xmath5 at the sum - gap knee , an acute back - bending appears in the ivc s , however even this does not cause principle changes in the `` measured '' @xmath92 . in experiments on large mesas @xcite or suspended structures @xcite , in which acute self - heating was reported , no clear ohmic tunneling resistance could be observed at high bias , in stark contrast to our mesas , see fig .",
    "m1a , and refs.@xcite .",
    "simulations as in fig .",
    "s9 clearly show that irrespective of self - heating the `` measured '' gap vanishes at @xmath7 , i.e. , simultaneously with the true gap .",
    "thus trivial self - heating simply can not `` hide '' the qualitative @xmath92 dependence .",
    "for example , there is no way in which one can get the vanishing `` measured '' ( self - heating affected ) gap if the true gap is @xmath3independent . therefore , the discrepancy in the measured strong @xmath3dependence of the gap at @xmath5 in intrinsic tunneling ( and recent arpes @xcite ) , or complete @xmath3independence in stm measurements @xcite can not be attributed to self - heating .",
    "to quantitatively analyze the significance of self - heating in our mesas , we provide values of the dissipation power @xmath98 for the studied mesas : for the near - op bi(y)-2212 mesa at @xmath111 dissipation at the sum - gap peak is @xmath112 . from the previous analysis of the size dependence of @xmath71 for similar mesas",

    "all of them exhibit perfect periodicity of quasiparticle branches @xcite and none of them exhibit back - bending at any @xmath16 , which according to fig .",

    "m3 b - d ) and m4 is free from self - heating because it was obtained at zero bias .    finally , it is important to emphasize that the concept of heat diffusion is inapplicable for small bi-2212 mesas containing only few atomic layers .",
    "the phonon transport in this case is ballistic @xcite and the energy flow from the mesa is determined not by collisions between the tunneled non - equilibrium qp with thermal phonons , but by spontaneous emission of a phonon upon relaxation of the non - equilibrium qp @xcite .",
    "this process is not hindered at @xmath120 .",
    "therefore , the effective @xmath69 ( and self - heating ) can be much smaller because it is not limited by poor thermal conductivity at @xmath120 , but is determined by the fast , almost @xmath3independent , non - equilibrium qp relaxation time .",

    "<S> a progressive decrease of the excess qp resistance at @xmath4 with decreasing doping is obvious .    </S>",
    "<S> we start discussion of the observed phenomena by recollecting the expected @xmath3 variation for conventional single qp tunneling characteristics . as discussed in sec . </S>",
    "<S> i of the supplementary information , provided the physical requirement that @xmath6 and the quasiparticle lifetime increase with decreasing @xmath16 , all single qp tunneling characteristics ( including @xmath51wave ) exhibit the following universal @xmath3dependence :    \\a ) opening of the superconducting gap at @xmath4 leads to appearance of the large excess qp resistance due to rapid freezing out of qp s upon their condensation into cooper pairs ( see inset in fig . </S>",
    "<S> s7 @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> \\b ) @xmath50 continues to grow with decreasing @xmath16 both due to freezing - out of thermal qp s and due to growth of the qp lifetime , which decreases the number of available sub - gap qp states . </S>",
    "<S> all this leads to a progressive growth of the slope of @xmath12 characteristics with decreasing @xmath16 .    </S>",
    "<S> the sudden appearance of excess resistance at @xmath4 in od mesas indicates that the superconducting transition here is conventional , in a sense that it is accompanied by opening of the superconducting gap , and is also consistent with single qp tunneling mechanism of interlayer transport .    however , the superconducting transition in underdoped mesas is clearly abnormal . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize again that appearance of the negative excess resistance and the crossover to @xmath3independent slope reflect the same phenomenon at zero and finite bias , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , any explanation of the observed unusual @xmath3dependence must account for both zero and finite bias behavior .    </S>",
    "<S> at the first glance , the lack of excess resistance at @xmath4 in ud mesas could be consistent with the precursor superconductivity scenario of the pseudogap @xcite , according to which the gap does not open and qp s do not start to pair at @xmath5 , but at much higher @xmath61 </S>",
    "<S> . then one could argue that the lack of excess resistance reflects simply the lack of dramatic changes in the qp spectrum upon establishing of the global phase coherence at @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the same argument would make it difficult to explain the abrupt crossover to @xmath3independent slope . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , as we noted above , the slope of @xmath12 should continue to increase with decreasing @xmath16 for single qp tunneling . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the observed crossover to constant slope can hardly be explained in terms of single qp tunneling @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion brings us to one possible interpretation of the observed phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> if the @xmath8axis transport in ud mesas is not solely due to single qp s , it must also involve pairs . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding multi - particle tunneling @xcite and the multiple andreev reflection @xcite processes are well studied for conventional low@xmath62 junctions . </S>",
    "<S> both processes are similar @xcite and are almost @xmath3 independent , because they do not rely on the presence of thermally excited qp s , but directly involve cooper pairs from the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> the multi - particle current occurs via elastic conversion ( dissociation or recombination ) of cooper pairs into qp s ; while the multiple andreev reflection process is due to transmutation of a quasielectron into a quasihole with creation of a cooper pair and can be universally described in terms of inelastic tunneling in the presence of time - dependent phase difference due to the ac - josephson effect @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the multi - particle processes result in almost @xmath3independent and @xmath63exponential subgap current @xcite , which essentially coincides with the description of the observed crossover , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the abruptness of the crossover at @xmath5 , points towards the coherent multiple andreev reflection mechanism of the interlayer current , because it requires the time - periodic ac - josephson effect @xcite and , consequently , abruptly disappears simultaneously with phase coherence at @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we may further speculate why the multiparticle processes become progressively more important with underdoping . </S>",
    "<S> the multiparticle current decrease much faster than the single qp current with decreasing the interface transparency @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the single qp dominates over multiparticle current , unless there are micro - shots in the tunnel barrier @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the required micro - shots in underdoped bi-2212 could arise from doping - dependent nano - scale inhomogeneity , observed at the surface of bi-2212 @xcite , which in this case should persists also in the bulk of bi-2212 crystals .    </S>",
    "<S> such interpretation implies that not only the electronic structure , but also the @xmath8axis _ transport mechanism _ changes with underdoping : from coherent and directional @xcite _ single _ qp tunneling in overdoped , to progressively increasing _ pair _ contribution in underdoped bi-2212 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is apparent only in the phase coherent state at @xmath4 , is almost @xmath3independent , and is consistent with multiple andreev reflection mechanism of the interlayer transport .    </S>",
    "<S> finally we note that the reported amazingly trivial thermal activation behavior in the whole normal state region , puts strong constrains on the nature of the @xmath8axis pseudogap . </S>",
    "<S> even though , the similar ta - behavior can be ascribed to several processes ( e.g. , inelastic tunneling via the impurity @xcite , or elastic tunneling via a resonant @xcite state in the tunnel barrier , or coulomb blocking of tunneling @xcite ) , it does not involve any gap , nor angular dependence in the qp spectrum , but assumes instead that there is some constant blocking barrier for interlayer hoping @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this may indicate that the `` large '' @xmath8axis pseudogap is not a pairing gap , which would naturally explain it s indifference to such classical depairing factors as temperature and magnetic field @xcite .    </S>",
