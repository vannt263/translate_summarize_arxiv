    "in the present  day analysis of various physical processes the complexity of the problem often makes it impossible to find a complete mathematical description of the experimentally measured or observed quantities . in order to proceed one",
    "usually simplifies the mathematical model which describes the bulk of the phenomena .",
    "the more delicate effects are accounted for through an expansion in terms of a small parameter which has to be defined such that one retains full quantitative control in the analysis .",
    "the art of a physicist consists in splitting the whole analysis into a main part and into small corrections to the main part for which one develops a perturbative expansion .",
    "one may quote one of the greatest physicists of the last century , l.d .",
    "landau , who used to say that physics starts when a small parameter of the problem has been found .",
    "the usefulness and power of such an approach has been proven over and over for many years .",
    "an example that comes into mind are the first accurate calculations analyzing high precision data from celestial mechanics in terms of newton s law of gravitation .",
    "when observational data on the motion of the planets became more accurate it was no longer sufficient to take into account only their gravitational interaction with the sun but it was necessary also to include the small corrections arising from the mutual gravitational interactions between the planets themselves .",
    "this was done through perturbation theory since the full equations for the planetary movements with mutual interaction fully taken into account are too difficult to treat analytically even within standard classical mechanics .",
    "a remarkable fact is that these corrections are very small but still have to be taken into account since the data are extremely precise .",
    "this is well illustrated by a historical example taken from astronomy which was the most precise scientific discipline in the past : the planets of the solar system close to earth were directly observed while an eighth planet ",
    "neptune  was first introduced in order to explain slight perturbations in the orbit of uranus .",
    "the orbit of neptune was theoretically calculated with high precision and the planet was directly observed later at the predicted place .",
    "let us now turn to high energy physics .",
    "the main interest of fundamental research in high energy physics is to find new physical phenomena and to place them into a consistent logical picture of the natural world which mankind inhabits .",
    "it is generally believed that the structure of fundamental interactions ( except gravity ) is qualitatively understood at the energies available at present accelerators .",
    "basically there are two trends for the search of new physics .",
    "one is aiming at a direct discovery of new physical phenomena and fundamental constituents of matter ( elementary particles ) by moving to higher and higher energies .",
    "this requires ever more powerful accelerating facilities while the precision of the experimental detection and theoretical calculations can remain at a moderate level .",
    "the other is an indirect search for new physics at low energies ( mainly through radiative corrections ) which is based on very precise experimental data at moderate energies and a high accuracy of the theoretical calculations  @xcite .",
    "a very recent example of the second category is the ongoing discussion about the possible appearance of deviations from the standard model ( sm ) of strong and electroweak interaction in new data on the muon anomalous magnetic moment  @xcite .",
    "this two - fold road to scientific discovery is well known and has been pursued for ages as illustrated by the above example from celestial mechanics .",
    "the muon anomalous magnetic moment has been computed in quantum electrodynamics ( qed )  the most precise physical theory of the present time .",
    "qed is a highly accurate theory of electromagnetic particle interactions where predictions for physical observables are calculated within perturbation theory in the form of a series in the expansion parameter of the theory , the fine structure constant @xmath9 with a numerical value of @xmath10 at zero momentum .",
    "the fact that @xmath9 is rather small makes the expansions well convergent .",
    "the muon anomalous magnetic moment has been computed through the expansion in the small ratio of lepton masses and the expansion in the coupling constant up to the order @xmath11 .",
    "the most recent result reads  @xcite @xmath12 where for instance  @xcite @xmath13 the theoretical expressions for the coefficients of this series involve complicated multidimensional integrals the evaluation of which is the main difficulty in the calculation of a series expansion for the muon anomalous magnetic moment . a part of the coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ mamm ] ) have been calculated analytically whereas the numbers in the higher order terms have to be evaluated numerically  @xcite .    with the advent of powerful computers a number of problems",
    "can now be approached through direct numerical calculations .",
    "the trajectories of satellites , for instance , are computed through direct calculations with computers .",
    "there are also important applications in quantum field theory ( qft ) especially , in the theory of strong interaction formulated on the lattice .",
    "however , at present the achieved accuracy is not yet sufficient leaving plenty of room for analytical computations .",
    "in addition , calculations in perturbation theory are often formulated in such a way that a numerical approach is not efficient or is unreliable due to the accumulation of rounding errors .",
    "the situation is quite analogous to the problem of long - time weather forecasts in meteorology where the direct numerical approaches are extremely unstable from the computational point of view .",
    "rounding errors of the numerical evaluation of a large number of feynman diagrams are such that the final accuracy is low because of huge cancellations between separate contributions of separate diagrams .",
    "although an analytic evaluation is definitely preferable it can not always be done due to technical difficulties in calculating the relevant feynman integrals .    in quantum field theory",
    "only a very limited number of problems have a full exact solution .",
    "perturbation theory is a general tool for investigating the realistic physical situations .",
    "this is especially true in the theory of strong interactions and in the standard model in general .",
    "the classical examples are the analysis of @xmath14 annihilation into hadrons and the analysis of tau decays where perturbation theory is used in its most advanced form for the calculation up to very high orders of the strong coupling constant  @xcite . in the latter case",
    "such an analysis has lead to the most accurate extraction of strong interaction parameters at low energies  @xcite .",
    "the attempt to extrapolate the calculations to all orders for some limited subsets of diagrams or contributions are also quite useful  @xcite .",
    "the coefficients of the expansions are given by complicated integrals which have a useful graphical representation in terms of feynman diagrams .",
    "graphical techniques are very efficient and convenient in the bookkeeping of the various loop contributions and are in wide use . in higher orders these graphs",
    "have many loops which are associated with the loop integrals .",
    "one speaks of multi - loop calculations for the evaluation of the coefficients of the perturbative expansion in qft . due to big advances in symbolic computing",
    "the most advanced symbolic programs can nowadays generate the terms of the perturbative expansion without actually drawing any graphs .",
    "nevertheless , the terminology has survived . nowadays",
    "the methods of qft ( and its terminology ) is starting to penetrate into fields other than high energy physics such as polymer physics , hydro- and aerodynamics and weather forecasts which are much closer to real life .",
    "therefore , the calculation of the complicated integrals associated with feynman diagrams in a perturbative expansion is important in high energy physics as well as in many other areas of physics .",
    "while the problem of calculating multi - loop integrals will not be solved in a general form in the foreseeable future , there is a continuing interest in the analysis of particular diagrams in the efforts to enlarge the number of known analytical results ( as a review , see e.g.  @xcite ) . especially promising in this regard",
    "is the analysis of subclasses of diagrams with simpler topological structures but with an arbitrary number of loops .",
    "the most promising in this respect is the simple topology of the so - called generalized sunrise diagrams ( sometimes also called sunset , water melon , banana , or basketball diagrams ) .",
    "they will be referred to as the sunrise - type diagrams in this report .",
    "they can be computed for an arbitrary number of loops which makes them an ideal tool to obtain clues to the structure of more complicated multi - loop diagrams  @xcite .",
    "recently there has been a renewal of interest in the calculation of diagrams of the sunrise - type topology for different numbers of loops involving different loop masses and/or external momenta of the diagram ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . the classical ( or genuine ) two - loop sunrise diagram with different values of the internal masses",
    "has recently been studied in some detail using the traditional momentum space approach ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) . in the present report we review the configuration space technique ( also called @xmath3-space technique ) for the calculation of sunrise - type diagrams .",
    "the configuration space technique is best suited for the topology of the diagram .",
    "it considerably reduces the complexity of the calculation and allows for new qualitative and quantitative results for this important particular class of feynman integrals  @xcite .",
    "configuration space techniques can be used to verify known results obtained within other techniques both analytically and numerically  @xcite and to investigate some general features of feynman diagram calculation  @xcite .",
    "we list features of the @xmath3-space technique in turn with the aim to show how efficient the method is .    the diagrams with sunrise - type topology form a subset of the general set of diagrams with a given number of loops .",
    "they appear in various specific physics applications :    * multi - loop calculations in general  @xcite * the analysis of static properties of baryons using sum rule techniques in qcd  @xcite * the properties of glueballs extracted from the perturbative analysis of two - point correlators  @xcite * the multi - particle phase space for multi - body decays of a single - particle phase space  @xcite * lattice qcd calculations  @xcite * mixing of neutral mesons  @xcite * chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) and effective theories for goldstone modes in higher orders of the momentum expansion  @xcite * analysis of exotic states in qft : multi - quark states in qcd or pentaquarks using sum rule techniques  @xcite * general questions of qft : sum rules in two - dimensional qed  @xcite and properties of baryons in the large @xmath15 limit of qcd  @xcite * effective potentials for symmetry breaking  @xcite * finite temperature calculations  @xcite * applications in nuclear physics  @xcite * phase space integrals for particles in jets where the momentum along the direction of the jet is fixed  @xcite * applications in solid state physics  @xcite    the principal aim of this report is to assemble all the necessary tools needed for the computation of multi - loop feynman diagrams with sunrise - type topology .",
    "we discuss the whole known spectrum of different methods to analyze these integrals .",
    "amomg these are concise analytical evaluation techniques , expansion in small parameters such as masses and momenta ( or inverse masses and momenta ) , expansions in special kinematical regions as the threshold regime in the minkowskian domain , integral representations for integrals including their discontinuity across physical cuts in terms of analytic functions of the external momentum , and , finally , efficient , fast , simple and stable numerical procedures . in the euclidean domain",
    "the numerical procedures derived from our representation are efficient and reliable , i.e.  stable against error accumulation . in order to acquaint the reader with the tools",
    "given given in the report we start with basic notations and relations .",
    "we present a comprehensive report on configuration space techniques including many technical details such that an interested reader can use this report as a practical guide for practical calculations .",
    "we have included a great deal of mathematical material such that the report is self - contained to a large degree . in most cases it is not necessary to consult mathematical handbooks in order to understand the calculations . we also give a rather large sample of worked - out examples .",
    "the calculational methods used are rather well - suited for further development and can easily be tailored to the further specific needs of the potential user .",
    "using the results of this paper one can create one s own software for an efficient evaluation of the many quantities of interest that can be extracted from the analysis of sunrise - type diagrams .",
    "the report is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we briefly summarize some general notions and their application to sunrise - type diagrams . in sec .",
    "2.1 we introduce the configuration space representation of sunrise - type diagrams and fix our notation . in sec .",
    "2.2 we specify what is meant by computing a sunrise - type diagram . in sec .",
    "2.3 we discuss the ultraviolet ( uv ) divergence structure of sunrise - type diagrams and present recipes to regularize the uv divergences either by subtraction or by dimensional regularization . in sec .",
    "2.4 we comment on the spectral density of sunrise - type diagrams and its connection to phase space .",
    "is devoted to some explicit configuration space calculations involving both analytical and numerical methods the results of which are compared to previously known results where other calculational techniques have been used .",
    "one of the examples is the direct computation of the spectral density of sunrise - type diagrams without taking recourse to fourier transforms .",
    "the results are important for multi - body phase space calculations . in sec .",
    "4 we discuss methods to find asymptotic expansions in different kinematical regimes of mass and/or momentum configurations in the euclidean domain .",
    "sec .  5 contains a generalization to non - standard propagators and non - scalar cases . in sec .",
    "6 we generalize the configuration space technique to other topologies .",
    "7 contains our conclusions .",
    "some of the lengthier formulas are relegated to the appendices , together with useful mathematical material about bessel functions and gegenbauer polynomials and a short treatise about cuts and discontinuities as they are occuring in the main text .",
    "sunrise - type diagrams are graphic representations of the @xmath16-loop two - point correlation functions in qft with @xmath17 internal propagators connecting the initial and final vertex .",
    "the well - studied genuine sunrise diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ sundi](a ) is the leading order perturbative correction to the lowest order propagator in @xmath18-theory , i.e.  it is a two - point two - loop diagram with three internal lines .",
    "this diagram emerges as a correction to the higgs boson propagation in the standard model .",
    "it also naturally appears in some effective theory approaches to critical phenomena and studies of phase transitions in qft .",
    "the corresponding leading order perturbative correction in @xmath19-theory is a one - loop diagram which can be considered as a oversimplified case of the prior example .",
    "the two - loop case is a standard starting point for the calculation of radiative corrections in qft .",
    "it emerges in a huge variety of physical applications .",
    "fortunately it can be analytically computed in any desired kinematical regime for any values of the relevant parameters . in this respect",
    "it does not present a real challenge as far as multi - loop calculations are concerned .",
    "we shall , nevertheless , discuss the genuine sunrise diagram in some detail in order to illustrate the efficiency of our configuration space methods .",
    "we shall compare our results with known exact analytical results obtained with other techniques .",
    "this provides a mutual check on the correctness of the results .",
    "a straightforward generalization of this topology to the multi - loop case is a correction to the free propagator in @xmath20-theory that contains @xmath16 loops and @xmath17 internal lines ( see fig .",
    "[ sundi](b ) ) .",
    "a subclass of the general sunrise - type diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ sundi](b ) is the case when the two external momenta vanish .",
    "this subclass is referred to as the subclass of vacuum bubble diagrams with sunrise - type topology which will be referred to as vacuum bubbles .",
    "they have a simpler structure than the true sunrise - type diagrams since the number of mass scales is reduced by one for the vacuum bubbles .",
    "we shall frequently return to the discussion of vacuum bubbles in the main text .",
    "a @xmath16-loop sunrise - type diagram is a two - point correlation function with @xmath17 propagators connecting points @xmath3 and @xmath21 and as such is explicitly given by a product of simple propagators built from the basic two - point correlation function @xmath22 , @xmath23 ( and/or their derivatives if necessary ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath22 may be the propagator of a free massive particle with mass @xmath24 or a more general two - point correlation function .",
    "the sunrise - type diagrams are the leading order contribution to a two - point correlation function of two local currents @xmath25 of the form @xmath26 where the fields @xmath27 have masses @xmath28 and where @xmath29 is a derivative with multi - index @xmath30 standing for @xmath31 .",
    "the sunrise - type diagrams are contained in the leading order expression for the polarization function @xmath32 where the brackets mean quantum mechanical averaging over the ground state which is explicitly given by a product of propagators and/or their derivatives , @xmath33 as the standard case we will consider a translation invariant situation in which the propagator depends on the difference of the arguments only , @xmath34 . an exception to this important standard case would be the existence of an arbitrary external field .",
    "however , in the present report we will not further discuss this possibility . in the standard case one of the vertices",
    "can conveniently be placed at the origin , say @xmath35 .",
    "the propagator is then a function of @xmath3 only , @xmath36 . the basic expression for the sunrise - type diagram in configuration space reads @xmath37 @xmath36 represents a free propagator of a massive particle with mass @xmath24 in @xmath0-dimensional ( euclidean ) space - time .",
    "it is given by @xmath38 where we have used @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath40 is the modified bessel function of the second kind ( sometimes also known as mcdonald function , see appendix  [ sec_bessel ] ) defined by eq .",
    "( [ defk ] ) .",
    "the massless propagator can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ xprop ] ) by taking the limit @xmath41 ( or more precisely the limit @xmath42 at fixed @xmath3 in terms of the dimensionless quantity @xmath43 ) .",
    "it reads @xmath44 and where @xmath45 is euler s gamma function .",
    "in some physics applications one may have more general basic two - point functions ( `` modified propagators '' ) for massive particles .",
    "an example is the calculation of the three - point function necessary for the determination of a particle form factor at zero momentum transfer when the external momentum of the current vanishes .",
    "this momentum configuration reduces the diagram to a sunrise - type diagram with more complicated basic two - point lines ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this phenomenon frequently occurs also in calculations of various quantities in chiral perturbation theory ( chpt )  @xcite .",
    "formally , these two - point functions can not be considered as propagators of a physical particle but emerge as effective basic two - point functions .",
    "the simplest modification of the basic propagator which frequently appears in applications is the occurrence of higher powers of the standard propagator . in momentum space",
    "it has the form @xmath46 for integer @xmath47 these cases appear if one e.g.  considers mass derivatives of the propagator as they are needed in certain parameter expansions .",
    "for instance , one can consider @xmath48 in the same way a derivative of the momentum itself will also increase the power of the propagator . for instance , the second order scalar derivative @xmath49 of the standard propagator will result in @xmath50 higher powers of propagators occur in many applications .",
    "therefore , any calculational technique should be well suited to treat such higher powers .",
    "it turns out that the configuration space method very naturally accommodates higher order derivatives .    in configuration space",
    "higher powers of the standard propagator with mass @xmath24 are explicitly given by ( cf .",
    "( [ xprop ] ) ) @xmath51 the additional power of denominator factors ( or , equivalently , the number of derivatives in masses ) is denoted in the corresponding feynman diagram by dots placed on the line ( though even the power can be non - integer ) .",
    "note that the modified propagator has the same functional form as the usual propagator .",
    "the main difference is the change of the value of the index of the bessel function @xmath52 .",
    "this fact unifies and simplifies the analysis of sunrise - type diagrams that contain more complicated basic propagators ( analytical expressions that correspond to one line of the diagrams ) as they emerge in some physical applications or are used for the calculation of other diagrams through recurrence relations techniques  @xcite .",
    "the calculation of loop diagrams in perturbative quantum field theory is associated with the evaluation of complicated multi - dimensional integrals , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that the expression for the sunrise - type diagram in configuration space given by eq .",
    "( [ xsun ] ) contains no integration at all even if it represents a multi - loop diagram . in this respect",
    "it is a kind of tree - level diagram that usually appears in the lowest orders of perturbative qft .",
    "however , `` to calculate '' a sunrise diagram means in most cases to find certain integrals of eq .",
    "( [ xsun ] ) over @xmath3 with some weight functions depending on the quantity in question .",
    "the simplest situation corresponds to a computation of the values of the vacuum bubbles , i.e.  expressions for the diagrams without external momenta ( or with vanishing external momenta , see e.g.  @xcite ) . in case of the sunrise - type topology the value of the vacuum bubble is given by integrals with a simple weight function ,",
    "@xmath53 this integral provides the simplest example of calculating a sunrise - type diagram .",
    "we like to emphasize that this calculation is almost always a must as it allows one to determine the counterterms related to uv divergences of sunrise - type diagrams that always occur in realistic physical models . due to rotation invariance",
    "the integral is one - dimensional as the angular integration can be explicitly done .",
    "thus @xmath54 the possibility to compute all vacuum bubbles in terms of one - dimensional integrals for any number of loops is a big advantage of the configuration space technique .",
    "this guarantees that the complete renormalization program can be explicitly accomplished in terms of one - dimensional integrals .",
    "it should be clear that this is a huge simplification .",
    "the most familiar example for the evaluation of a sunrise - type diagram is the procedure of finding its value in momentum space , or put differently , the evaluation of its fourier transform .",
    "it corresponds to non - bubble diagrams with two external lines as the integrals then requires the computation of the fourier transform of @xmath55 , @xmath56 the required integrals are basically scalar integrals .",
    "this makes the angular integration in eq .",
    "( [ bubble ] ) simple in @xmath0-dimensional space - time .",
    "the needed formula is the integration over the angular variables @xmath57 which , in explicit form , reads @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is the bessel function of the first kind .",
    "the integration @xmath62 over the rotationally invariant measure @xmath57 on the unit sphere in @xmath0-dimensional ( euclidean ) space - time means integration over angles only .",
    "the generalization of eq .",
    "( [ angint ] ) to more complicated integrands with an additional tensor structure @xmath63 is straightforward and leads to different orders @xmath64 of the bessel function for different irreducible tensors ( denoted by the number @xmath65 ) after angular averaging ( integration over angles ) .",
    "the corresponding order of the bessel function can be inferred from the expansion of the plane wave function @xmath66 which appears as a weight function upon computing the fourier transform in a series of gegenbauer polynomials @xmath67 ( see appendix  [ sec_gegenbauer ] ) .",
    "the gegenbauer polynomials are orthogonal on a @xmath0-dimensional unit sphere , and the expansion of the plane wave in terms of gegenbauer polynomials reads  @xcite @xmath68 besides the definition of the gegenbauer polynomials by a characteristic polynomial as given in eq .",
    "( [ gegengen ] ) , the expansion in eq .",
    "( [ gegen ] ) can also serve as a definition of these polynomials .    the representation in eq .",
    "( [ gegen ] ) allows one to single out an irreducible tensorial structure from the angular integration given by the fourier integral in eq .",
    "( [ bubble ] ) .",
    "integration techniques involving gegenbauer polynomials for the computation of multi - loop massless diagrams are described in detail in  @xcite where many useful relations can be found ( see also  @xcite where the calculation in momentum space was considered ) .",
    "one arrives at a representation of the fourier transform of a sunrise - type diagram that is given in terms of the one - dimensional integral @xmath69 which is simple to analyze . the representation given by eq .",
    "( [ psun ] ) is quite universal .",
    "while the configuration space expression for the sunrise - type diagram contains no integration it does not always represent an integrable function of @xmath3 in configuration space for general values of the space - time dimension @xmath0 . the expression given by eq .",
    "( [ xsun ] ) can have non - integrable singularities at small @xmath3 for a sufficiently large number of propagators if the space - time dimension is @xmath70 .    upon multiplication of many propagators",
    "one may get a function which is singular at small @xmath3 .",
    "each propagator by itself can be considered as a distribution .",
    "however , distributions do not form an algebra and their multiplication is not well - defined  @xcite . in this respect",
    "the polarization function @xmath55 in eq .",
    "( [ xsun ] ) is not completely defined as a proper distribution . in attempting to integrate such a function over the whole @xmath3-space we encounter infinities in the form of ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the computation of the fourier transform of @xmath55 requires regularization ( for instance , dimensional regularization ) and subtraction .",
    "configuration space provides a nice environment for this .",
    "note that all these statements depend on the dimension of space - time .",
    "the vicinity of @xmath71 is special since the leading singularity of the basic propagator is only logarithmic and the multiplication of propagators does not lead to non - integrable singularities . therefore , the uv properties of two - dimensional models that are often considered as simplified models in qft or that emerge in real physical applications as a result of some given approximations  @xcite .",
    "they are much softer than those of realistic four - dimensional models ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .    in general , however , one has to consider an arbitrary space - time dimension @xmath0 . the modern way of dealing with singularities in qft in particular in multi - loop calculations is mostly based on dimensional regularization  @xcite ( as a review see  @xcite ) .",
    "dimensional regularization is characterized by considering the space - time dimension @xmath0 to be an arbitrary parameter , for instance @xmath72 where @xmath73 is an integer dimension . for real physical applications",

    "@xmath76 is natural for near threshold expansions or expansions in the minkowskian domain in general . ] in case of non - integer space - time dimension @xmath0 the integration is well - defined , while the limit @xmath79 is singular , consisting usually of poles in @xmath80 .",
    "these pole parts are extremely simple to handle in configuration space .",
    "indeed , in configuration space the regularization is given by adding the @xmath81-function @xmath82 and its derivatives to @xmath55 . as we will see in the following",
    ", this procedure corresponds to adding a polynomial in momentum space ( local counterterms according to the bogoliubov - parasiuk - hepp - zimmermann ( bphz ) theorem  @xcite ) .",
    "the finite parts can be found numerically for any number of loops by doing a single one - dimensional integration .",
    "therefore , the renormalization in @xmath3-space becomes @xmath83 where @xmath84 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath85 are functions of the regularization parameter @xmath86 which are singular in the limit @xmath87 .",
    "the extraction of the coefficients @xmath85 is explained in the subsequent sections for some special cases .",
    "the number @xmath88 of counterterms is determined by dimensional arguments such as power counting and can be easily related to the number of propagators and the space - time dimension .",
    "the actual number of poles depends on the mass configuration .      from the physics point of view one important aspect of our analysis of sunrise - type diagrams",
    "is the construction of the spectral decomposition of the diagrams .",

    "contrary to this the imaginary parts add up and one obtains @xmath731      for powers with exponents close to integer values such as @xmath732 the calculation of the discontinuity is closely related to the calculation of the discontinuity of the logarithm because @xmath733 similarly , the discontinuity of @xmath732 can be obtained in the more general case in closed form . in order to calculate the discontinuity of a power @xmath732 with non - integer exponent @xmath734 ( we include the minus sign for later convenience ) we first have to ponder where the discontinuities can appear .",

    "the asymptotic expansion of the modified bessel function of the first kind reads @xmath743 where the plus sign is valid for @xmath744 while the minus sign has to be taken for @xmath745 .",
    "the surprising fact is that there are two different asymptotic expansions available at every point of the complex plane , except for the arguments @xmath746 .",
    "therefore , in continuing @xmath747 to the complex plane , the choice is still unique .",

    "<S> we review recently developed new powerful techniques to compute a class of feynman diagrams at any loop order , known as sunrise - type diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> these sunrise - type topologies have many important applications in many different fields of physics and we believe it to be timely to discuss their evaluation from a unified point of view . </S>",
    "<S> the method is based on the analysis of the diagrams directly in configuration space which , in the case of the sunrise - type diagrams and diagrams related to them , leads to enormous simplifications as compared to the traditional evaluation of loops in momentum space . </S>",
    "<S> we present explicit formulae for their analytical evaluation for arbitrary mass configurations and arbitrary dimensions at any loop order . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss several limiting cases of their kinematical regimes which are e.g.relevant for applications in hqet and nrqcd . </S>",
    "<S> we completely solve the problem of renormalization using simple formulae for the counterterms within dimensional regularization . </S>",
    "<S> an important application is the computation of the multi - particle phase space in @xmath0-dimensional space - time which we discuss . </S>",
    "<S> we present some examples of their numerical evaluation in the general case of @xmath0-dimensional space - time as well as in integer dimensions @xmath1 for different values of dimensions including the most important practical cases @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> substantial simplifications occur for odd integer space - time dimensions where the final results can be expressed in closed form through elementary functions . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the use of recurrence relations naturally emerging in configuration space for the calculation of special series of integrals of the sunrise topology . </S>",
