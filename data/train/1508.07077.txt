    "the main routes that are actively being explored include surface functionalization of nanoparticles using short dna molecules @xcite , and exploiting the depletion interaction between colloids in the presence of small polymer chains @xcite . here",
    "we focus on the depletion interaction , since it is of entropic origin and arises without the need for engineering particle surface chemistry , emerging in mixtures of colloids with non - adsorbing polymer .",

    "it has been demonstrated that depletion enhances the directional entropic forces @xcite resulting from anisotropic particle shape , and that it promotes the contact between large facets .",
    "the depletion interaction can promote binding between lock and key colloids @xcite and lead to the formation of porous phases @xcite . because depletion mediates an additional attraction of entropic origin , this interaction",
    "can be thought of as competing with contact ( excluded volume ) interactions resulting from particle shape .",
    "depletion thus enables novel phase behavior through the additional parameters of depletant shape and density @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to have a method to investigate the self - assembly of anisotropic shapes in the presence of depletants .",
    "results for the phase behavior of binary hard sphere mixtures have been reported@xcite using thermodynamic integration . in general , however , such results are challenging to obtain because of the size disparity between the colloid and the depletant .",
    "if one is interested in the phase behavior of the colloids , a customary approximation treats the depletant particles as an ideal gas@xcite .",
    "this approximation would , in principle , allow integrating out the depletant to arrive at an effective colloid - colloid interaction ; however , the resulting interaction is a many - body interaction and we are not aware of any prior implementation that treats many - body effects exactly . here",
    ", we propose a novel , parallel monte carlo algorithm to simulate the depletion interaction between arbitrarily shaped colloids in an efficient manner that includes many - body effects .",
    "figure [ fig : explicit_implicit ] shows the effect of depletion interactions between two hard tetrahedra in solution with small penetrable hard spheres .",
    "the small spheres mediate an attractive interaction between the colloids that drives them to aggregate face to face . for two particles only , the depletion interaction can be easily simulated explicitly ( left panel ) or implicitly ( right panel ) .",
    "however , implicit simulation of depletion interactions allow for a tremendous performance benefit , particularly for dilute systems of colloids and high densities of depletants , as we demonstrate below .",

    "a geometric cluster algorithm has also been proposed by dress and krauth @xcite , which is rejection - free and can therefore greatly enhance the equilibration of dilute systems of colloids . however ,",
    "when the system is dense in colloids , clusters can span the system and the algorithm ceases to be efficient @xcite . to explore the phase behavior of a system of hard spheres in penetrable hard - sphere depletants , vink and horbach proposed grand - canonical simulation of both the colloids and the depletants , and they could efficiently sample the gas - liquid coexistence curve @xcite .",
    "however , their scheme does not generalize well beyond to the fluid - solid transition , because it is based on particle insertion .",
    "all these methods have in common that they track the small depletant particles explicitly , which are stored in memory .",
    "an interesting alternative was proposed by dijkstra et al .",
    "@xcite , who proposed a monte carlo integration of the free volume around every single moved colloid",
    ". however , their scheme does not obey detailed balance , and achieving sufficient accuracy comes at the expense of computation time , as we discuss in more detail below .",
    "another implicit implementation of the depletion interaction between octahedra was proposed by henzie et al .",
    "@xcite , where the generally anisotropic many - body interaction is reduced to an isotropic pair potential .",
    "we note that such a drastic simplification , while rendering the problem computationally tractable , is insufficient to allow the study of arbitrary shapes .",
    "the scheme we describe in the following section is a completely general treatment of depletion interactions between anisotropic particles due to an ideal gas of depletants , and works well both for dilute and dense systems . in the ideal gas treatment , depletants interact with colloids but not with each other .",

    "next , we show that the above scheme obeys detailed balance , which is required for correctly sampling the ensemble defined by eq .   in the statistical sense .",

    ", consequently our restricted sampling algorithm obeys detailed balance .",
    "we may choose @xmath58 as the smallest region with @xmath59 that is convenient to sample from .",

    "we remark that a further possible optimization consists in restricting the sampling to the excluded volume _ shell _ of the moved colloid @xmath63 , and it can be shown , using steps analogous to above , that such a choice also fulfills detailed balance .",
    "the algorithm described above gives finite acceptance rates for translation step sizes @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the size of the colloid , which is in general anisotropic .",
    "however , when there is more than one depletant in the excluded volume shell around the colloid particle on average , moves will be rejected most of the time .",

    "additional phases can be stabilized@xcite .",
    "the algorithm can also be used to study the aggregation of entropically patchy colloids into colloidal polymer chains , held together by strong depletion bonds @xcite . in this context",
    ", it would be interesting to study solutions as well as melts of such colloidal polymers .",
    "an interesting open question concerns whether depletant entropy can stabilize not only close - packed but also open ordered structures @xcite . in protein crystallization , depletant polymers are commonly used as precipitants .",
    "an important limitation of our algorithm is that it treats only non - interacting depletants , and the validity of that approximation remains to be investigated for specific systems .",
    "in contrast to enthalpically patchy models , our algorithm does not require implementation of shape - specific attractive patches to study aggregation of colloids , and the algorithm is therefore highly robust and generic .",
    "we are thankful to werner krauth for a discussion that led to the development of this algorithm .",

    "hardware support by nvidia corp . is gratefully acknowledged .",
    "in the gpu implementation , we perform the colloid trial moves in the active cells@xcite and the depletant insertions in different kernels .",
    "to insert depletants , we draw a random number of depletants for every moved colloid , as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : basic ] .",
    "we use a one - to - one mapping between depletants and thread groups of size @xmath113 . here",
    ", @xmath114 is the maximum number of threads that can perform overlap checks synchronously , and we tune @xmath115 at run - time . when any thread detects an overlap between the depletant and any particles in the old configuration , the depletant is ignored . in the other case , if the depletant overlaps with the moved colloid , that colloid move is flagged for rejection .    when the configurational bias scheme is used ( @xmath116 ) , a second kernel with a similar thread mapping is launched , however , depletants are assigned to whole thread blocks of size @xmath117 , which is an auto - tuned parameter , so that the bias weights of different reinsertions belonging to the same depletant can be summed in shared memory .",

    "<S> we present an algorithm to simulate the many - body depletion interaction between anisotropic colloids in an implicit way , integrating out the degrees of freedom of the depletants , which we treat as an ideal gas . because the depletant particles are statistically independent and the depletion interaction is short - ranged , depletants are randomly inserted in parallel into the excluded volume surrounding a single translated and/or rotated colloid . </S>",
    "<S> a configurational bias scheme is used to enhance the acceptance rate . the method is validated and benchmarked both on multi - core cpus and graphics processing units ( gpus ) for the case of hard spheres , hemispheres and discoids . with depletants , </S>",
    "<S> we report novel cluster phases , in which hemispheres first assemble into spheres , which then form ordered hcp / fcc lattices . </S>",
    "<S> the method is significantly faster than any method without cluster moves and that tracks depletants explicitly , for systems of colloid packing fraction @xmath0 , and additionally enables simulation of the fluid - solid transition . </S>"
