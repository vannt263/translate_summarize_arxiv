    "phononic crystals , artificial materials with periodically arranged compounds , were introduced more than two decades ago as the elastic waves analogue of photonic crystals  @xcite .",
    "these materials , either in two or three dimensions , are capable of exhibiting large frequency regions of prohibited propagation of elastic waves , the so - called phononic band gaps ( pbgs ) .",
    "phononic crystals have been efficiently used in applications including audible filters  @xcite , acoustic diodes  @xcite and cloaking  @xcite , ultrasound imaging  @xcite , optomechanics  @xcite , heat conduction  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the hyperuniformity concept was first introduced as an order metric for ranking point patterns according to their local density fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "hyperuniform structures cover the intermediate regime between random and periodic structures , and exhibit properties usually associated with both of these two extremes .",
    "hyperuniform stealthy disordered photonic structures exhibit large isotropic photonic band gaps and are capable of blocking light of all polarizations  @xcite .",
    "therefore , they can be efficiently used in the design of low dielectric contrast band gaps @xcite , high-@xmath0 optical cavities , free - form waveguides @xcite , polarizers @xcite , plasmon - enhanced raman spectroscopy @xcite , quantum cascade lasers @xcite , etc .",
    "markedly , compared with the studies of disorder in photonic systems , research on disordered phononic systems has been sparse .",
    "there have been some studies focused on two - dimensional ( 2d )  @xcite and three - dimensional ( 3d )  @xcite disordered phononic structures , but these structures were not ideally suited for opening large phononic band gaps ( pbgs ) .",
    "the most insightful study into disorder has been by chen et al .",
    "the study of disorder in elastic media is relevant for macroscopic scale applications , such as control of seismic waves  @xcite and modeling of rocks  @xcite to the micro- and nano - scale applications , including acoustic filters  @xcite , piezoelectric materials  @xcite , aviation  @xcite , bio - materials  @xcite , fracture  @xcite , manipulation of the thermal conductance  @xcite , etc .",
    "moreover appropriately designed disordered phononic systems can suppress wave transport for a wider range of frequencies than their periodic counterparts  @xcite .",
    "designed hyperuniform disordered phononic structures ( hdps ) have the advantage of exploiting both structural disorder , due to the absence of translation symmetry , and sort - scale ordering , due to the high degree of hyperuniformity .",
    "this combination makes them ideal for phonon manipulation since they can exhibit large band gaps , isotropy and diffusive propagation at the same time",
    ". therefore they can play a very important role in all the above mentioned application areas .    in this paper",
    "we introduce and analyze hdps .",
    "such structures exhibit structural disorder , while being statistically isotropic  @xcite .",
    "moreover , they are designed from totally disordered initial states , therefore they have no sign of underlying periodicity , which differentiates them from all previous structures studied in the literature . the radial distribution function and the diffraction patterns ( 2d fourier transform ) of the structure",
    "are used to investigate the correlated disorder of the structure .",

    "we note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : elasticz ] ) is a pseudo - scalar equation for the @xmath42 component of the purely transverse elastic field , however eq .",
    "( [ eq : elasticxy ] ) couples the @xmath43 and @xmath44 components of the elastic field .",
    "moreover , @xmath45 is a mixture of a longitudinal and a transverse component . in order to separate the longitudinal and transverse components",
    "we can use the displacement potentials @xmath46 and @xmath47 , which are defined by the equation @xmath48 the wave equations satisfied by the displacement potentials , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , can be written in the form @xmath49 and @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 the longitudinal wave and transverse wave velocities , respectively  @xcite .",
    "therefore the scalar potential is connected to purely longitudinal waves , while the vector potential is connected to purely transverse ( shear ) waves .",
    "moreover for the in - plane waves we consider here it can be easily shown that @xmath53 .",
    "these potentials carry the same phase shift information as the initial fields . however these potentials need not be continuous along interfaces .",
    "we note that the quantity @xmath54 , which in the linear elastic regime describes the angle of shear rotations ( transverse part of the field ) around the @xmath36 axis  @xcite , is proportional to @xmath55 , while the quantity @xmath56 , which express local changes in the volume ( area for 2d ) of the structure  @xcite , is proportional to @xmath57 .",
    "we consider cylinders made of lead ( pb ) with density @xmath58  g/@xmath59 , transverse velocity @xmath602160  m / s , and longitudinal velocity @xmath61  m / s in an epoxy host matrix with @xmath62  g/@xmath59 , @xmath63  m / s , and @xmath64  m / s , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the filling fraction of the structure is @xmath65 .",
    "these materials and the filling fraction correspond to the ones used in the literature for a 2d disordered structure , originating from a square lattice  @xcite , for comparison .",
    "however the results are expected to be similar for other relatively hard disks in relatively soft embedding solids .",
    "moreover the filling fraction is not optimized for the disordered case although the size of the band gaps of the hdps as compared to the periodic one suggests that it is close to the optimum value .",
    "the phononic band structure for such a 2d arrangement of cylinders can have two distinct type of elastic modes : out - of - plane ( pure transverse ) modes , similar to 2d tm photonic modes and in - plane ( mixed longitudinal and transverse ) modes , corresponding to the 2d te photonic modes .",
    "the band structure for the out - of - plane modes is shown in the left - hand diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : bandsz ] , calculated with a finite element commercial software ( comsol multiphysics^^ ) .",
    "the pbgs for such disordered structures turn out to be equivalent to the fundamental band gap in periodic systems in the sense that the spectral location of the tm gap , for example , is determined by the resonant modes of the individual cylinders ( mie resonances ) . indeed , in the middle diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : bandsz ] , we see that the frequency of the lower edge of the band gaps is in a nice agreement with the first mode of the cylinder , as calculated using ref .  , and in good agreement with calculations using fem .",
    "the pbg for the hdps are equivalent to the fundamental band gap in periodic systems , since in the former case the band gap occurs between the @xmath10 , @xmath66 bands , instead of the first and second band of the periodic structure and we have exactly @xmath10 scatterers in each unit ( super)cell .",
    "this can be interpreted in terms of an effective folding due to this `` average '' periodicity , which the hdps exhibits due to the short - range geometric order . in the disordered ( periodic ) structure",
    "the pbg extends from @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) to @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) , i.e. , in the disordered case the pbg ( @xmath71 ) has almost the same size as the periodic one ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "however there is a large number of edge states ( localized modes ) on both sides of the pbg in the disordered case , as was also the case for pure random 2d phononic structures  @xcite .",
    "we note that frequency scales with length and if we consider , e.g. , @xmath73",
    "@xmath32 m then the hdps pbg extends from 350 to 650  mhz .    the transmission through a finite , along the @xmath74 axis , slab of the disordered structure of length @xmath75 is shown in the right - hand diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : bandsz ] .",
    "we impose periodic boundary condition along the @xmath76 axis and perfectly matched layers ( pml ) along the @xmath74 axis .",
    "the excitation is done by a uniform load with a direction along the @xmath36 axis .",
    "we can clearly identify that the transmission becomes vanishingly small inside the pbg .",
    "moreover , above the pbg the diffusive propagation of the waves retains relatively small values for the transmission .",
    "this is connected to the observation made by sainidou et al .",
    "@xcite regarding the enlargement of the transmission gap in a disordered phononic structure .    in order to explore the origin of the pbgs in the hdps",
    "we employ the so - called concentration factor , which in the photonics case is strongly related to the appearance of band gaps  @xcite .",
    "the concentration factor relates to the idea that the eigenmodes are minimized states of an energy functional  @xcite , and can be defined as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the position - dependent mass density .",
    "we note that @xmath79 are the eigenmodes of the eigenvalue problem of the elastic field  @xcite and @xmath80 , as a function of the normalized frequency , @xmath81 , for a large number of @xmath7 vectors for the hdps ( solid black lines ) and for the relevant periodic structure ( dashed red lines ) .",

    "[ fig : cfactors ] shows the sudden drop of the @xmath82 , above the band edge , which implies that now the kinetic energy is mainly distributed in the host matrix , while below the pbg it was mainly distributed inside the cylinders . for the periodic structure",
    "there is strong dispersion of the position of the curves for different @xmath7 values which is a direct consequence of the fact that the periodic structure is an anisotropic structure , while the hdps is an isotropic one .",
    "finally , we note a slight anomaly of @xmath82 at about @xmath83 , connected to the change in the spatial distribution of the modes , as we discuss in the next paragraph .",

    "[ fig : z - modes ] . in the long wavelength limit [ fig .",
    "[ fig : z - modes](a ) ] the hdps seems to act as a homogeneous effective medium , however the inhomogeneity still plays an important role and we observe strong enhancement of the field on specific cylinders , or aggregates of cylinders acting as local scatterers . at higher frequencies , below the band gap , the modes mostly resemble monopole like modes , with cylindrical symmetry of the displacement field within the cylinders and the energy concentrated within the cylinders , suggesting a hoping mechanism for transmission .",
    "we clearly see that as we go pass @xmath83 , i.e from fig .",
    "[ fig : z - modes](a ) to fig .",
    "[ fig : z - modes](b ) the modes change from collective to more isolated ones , connected to the slight change in @xmath82 .",
    "moreover there is a phase difference of approximately 180@xmath91 of the field among neighboring cylinders .",
    "we also note that there is a large number of strongly localized modes in the vicinity of the pbg ( edge states ) .",
    "the two modes in figs .",
    "[ fig : z - modes](c ) and  [ fig : z - modes](d ) are such an example exactly at the band edge . above the pbg",
    "there is increased concentration of the fields between the scatterers , which supports the idea that the elastic waves are diffusely transmitted in between the scatterers .",
    "moreover the modes above the band gap show a dipole - like behavior , similar to the one of the second resonance of the single cylinder ( see the left - hand diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : bandsz ] ) .",
    "let us now consider the in - plane modes which , being a mixture of longitudinal and transverse waves , are expected to have a more complex behavior .",
    "the band structure for these modes is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bandsxy](c ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bandsxy](b ) we show the band structure of the corresponding periodic structure with the same filling fraction .",
    "we note that the brillouin zones in the two cases are not the same , due to the effective folding of the hdps .",
    "the area of the hdps supercell band structure ( denoted by prime symbols ) is the @xmath92 of the periodic one .",
    "however , in the long wavelength limit the band structures have the same slopes , as expected for a homogenized material of the same filling fraction . moreover , in this case the opening of the band gap occurs between the bands 1500 and 1501 , instead of the third and fourth band of the periodic structure , indicating again a 500 folding due to the `` average '' periodicity ( short - range order ) of the structure .",
    "however , for the in - plane polarization the hdps ( periodic structure ) band gap extends from @xmath93 ( @xmath93 ) to @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) , i.e. , in the disordered case the band gap ( @xmath96 ) is smaller than the periodic one ( @xmath97 ) , implying that the in - plane modes are more sensitive to disorder . of course , the band gap is still quite large due to existence of the sort - range order in the hdps .",
    "we should also note that in this case the structure supports many edge states ( localized modes ) .",
    "moreover , interestingly enough , the lower band edge of the hdps and the periodic structure coincide .",
    "this is not accidental , but has to do with the localized mode of the single cylinder , shown in the lower inset of fig .",

    "this mode see also fig .",
    "[ fig : modesxy](d ) and relevant discussion .",
    "however , the upper band edge has shifted to lower frequencies due to the formation of a large number of localized modes near the top band gap edge .",
    "moreover the modes above the band gap edge resemble the field profile of the single mode shown in the upper inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : bandsxy](a ) .    the transmission in this case , shown in the right - hand diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : bandsxy ] , has similar behavior as for the out - of - plane polarization and is almost independent of the polarization of the incident wave .",
    "we can again see that due to diffusive propagation transmission is low above the band gap .",
    "for the in - plane waves the drop in the transmission ( @xmath98  db ) within the band gap is somewhat smaller compared to the out - of - plane ones ( @xmath99  db ) .",
    "these results indicate that the in - plane modes are more affected by the disorder . however , overall , we still have sufficiently large band gaps and corresponding transmission drops .    in the right - hand diagram of fig .  [",
    "fig : cfactors ] we show the concentration factor for the in - plane modes .",
    "we again see a similar behavior with the kinetic energy distribution concentrated inside the cylinders below the band gap and outside the cylinders above the band gap . however in this case both the periodic structure and the hdps exhibit stronger anisotropy than in the out - of - plane polarization .",
    "moreover , @xmath82 abruptly drops at about @xmath100 , while remaining almost constant in the region 0.42@xmath101 , connected to the fact that there is a decrease in the density of states , as is indicated by the decreased density in the number of bands we find over this region .",

    "however , just a little bit higher in frequency [ fig .",
    "[ fig : modesxy](c ) ] the modes rapidly localize .",
    "interestingly whilst doing so they keep their mixed - resonance character . at even higher frequencies",
    "the modes take on a clear monopole - like appearance and gradually evolve from localized back to extended .",

    "this behavior is quite peculiar and was not found for the out - of - plane modes .",

    "these results indicate that these structures can be used as frequency filters , with the added advantage of being highly isotropic .",
    "this latter characteristic makes them also strong candidates for in- and out - coupling of free - space elastic waves with waveguides .",
    "high-@xmath0 cavity modes can be , therefore , easily implemented .",

    "however , we expect this to be the case even by just altering the size or misplace one or more cylinders , depending on the mode localization we want to achieve .",
    "we were able to find extremely large q - factors , ignoring intrinsic phonon - phonon scattering , and strong localization of the field profile .",
    "combined with the fact that in these structures diffusive propagation and a large number of localized modes are observed , such structures can be efficiently used for thermal conductivity reduction  @xcite .",
    "moreover the fact that these structures are also very efficient in photonics applications implies that they can be also used to create optomechanical and/or phoxonic devices  @xcite .",
    "waveguiding in such structures can also be very efficient .",
    "it is shown that 100% transmission through arbitrary bends is possible , due to isotropy .",
    "this is a very important result , since this behavior can not been found in conventional periodic structures , where you need to follow high symmetry lines .",
    "therefore such structures are very strong candidates for phononic integrated circuits  @xcite .",
    "we have also shown that 3d thin layer hdps behave similar to the 2d ones , in terms of the large effective band gaps and the existence of high-@xmath0 cavity modes .",
    "this is an important aspect for practical applications , since very thick ( 2d ) structures are , in many cases , not efficient .",
    "although we mainly discuss micro and nano - scale applications we expect that the understanding and control of such coupling between random and short - range ordered structures is important in the macroscale as well , such as in the understanding of seismic wave propagation , fracture in complex structures , as well as bio - materials , which all include some kind of correlated disorder .",
