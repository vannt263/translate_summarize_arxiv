    "this discrepancy is particularly demonstrable in the case of persistent - current qubits @xcite or flux qubits @xcite .",
    "flux qubits consist of a superconducting loop interrupted by either one or three josephson junctions @xcite .",
    "the two quantum states of flux gubit are persistent current @xmath5 circulating in the loop clockwise and anticlockwise in an externally produced magnetic field @xmath3 corresponding approximately the half @xmath6 of the flux quantum @xmath7 inside the loop @xcite .",
    "the qubit effective hamiltonian are represented by the pauli spin matrices @xmath8 , @xmath9 @xcite , that is @xmath10 as well as the hamiltonian of spin - 1/2 .",
    "the energy difference between two spin states of electron , for example , is the energy @xmath11 of magnetic moment equal the bohr magneton @xmath12 in external magnetic field @xmath13 .",
    "this energy of flux qubit should be equal @xmath14 when @xmath15 and the flux qubit loop is in the flat @xmath16 .",
    "but this energy is not take into account although the energy considered in the theory @xcite @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 is the maximum qubit persistent current ) is much lower than the energy @xmath19 near the half of the flux quantum @xmath20 .",
    "the two states of flux qubit are assumed at @xmath21 because of the requirement @xmath22 that the complex pair wave function @xmath23 must be single - valued at any point in a superconductor .",
    "superconducting loop without josephson junctions should also have such two states due to this requirement or the quantization of angular momentum of cooper pair @xmath24 the idea of flux qubit presupposes the superposition of two macroscopic quantum states @xcite assumed first by anthony leggett in the 1980s @xcite .",
    "we will not consider the problem of superposition ( described with the term @xmath25 in ( 1 ) ) assumed only in a superconducting loop interrupted by josephson junctions .",
    "we take an interest in the energy difference @xmath26 of the term @xmath27 between two permitted states .",
    "therefore superconducting loop without josephson junctions will be considered first of all .",
    "the relation @xmath28 deduced from the requirement ( 2 ) can describe the meissner effect , magnetic flux quantization and quantization of pair velocity or persistent current @xcite .",
    "the meissner effect i.e. the expulsion of magnetic flux @xmath29 from the interior of a superconductor , discovered by meissner and ochsenfeld in 1933 @xcite , is observed in a bulk entire superconductor in which the wave function @xmath23 has no singularity and therefore the quantum number @xmath30 and , according to ( 3 ) , @xmath31 inside superconductor where the density of superconducting current @xmath32 .",
    "the flux quantization was observed first in 1961 @xcite with the help of measurements of magnetic flux trapped in hollow superconducting cylinder the wall width @xmath33 of which is larger @xmath34 than the london penetration depth @xmath35 @xcite ( @xmath36 for most superconductors @xcite ) .",

    "the kinetic inductance @xmath43 exceeds in this case the magnetic inductance @xmath44 and one can always neglect the magnetic flux @xmath45 induced with the current @xmath5 for a sufficiently thin superconductor @xcite .",
    "therefore the magnetic flux @xmath46 equals approximately the one @xmath47 of externally produced magnetic field @xmath48 .",
    "quantization effect in the weak screening limit was observed first by w. a. little and r. d. parks @xcite at measurements of the resistance of thin cylinder in the temperature region corresponding to its superconducting resistive transition .",
    "later on quantum periodicity of other quantities were observed : ring resistance @xcite , magnetic susceptibility @xcite , critical current @xcite and dc voltage measured on segments of asymmetric rings @xcite .",
    "superconducting ring according to ( 4 ) , as well as flux qubit , has at @xmath49 the two permitted current states @xmath50 when @xmath51 and @xmath52 when @xmath53 .",
    "cl : the electric current @xmath54 circulating in the loop induces magnetic dipole moment @xmath55 .",
    "moment @xmath56 of force @xmath57 acts on this loop in magnetic field @xmath58 .",
    "the moment of mechanical force @xmath59 should be applied and the energy @xmath60 should be expended in order to overturn the loop when the constant value of the current @xmath54 is maintained with the help of power source ps .",
    "clockwise current changes into anticlockwise current relatively the @xmath61 direction after this turning - over .",

    "the energy of a sufficiently thin superconducting loop with homogeneous cooper pair density @xmath65 should equal @xmath66 =   \\int _ { l}dl sn _ { s } \\frac{mv ^{2}}{2 } + \\int _ { v}dvn _ { s}u$ ] .",
    "the potential energy @xmath67 does not depend on magnetic flux @xmath29 and is not considered in the theory of quantization .",
    "the kinetic energy of cooper pairs @xmath68 does not depend on direction of the velocity @xmath69 or the current @xmath70 .",
    "thus , two permitted state @xmath62 and @xmath71 with different angular momentum have the same energy @xmath72 at @xmath73 and the energy difference @xmath74 according to the canonical hamiltonian ( 5 ) .",
    "but we know that the energy of two states having different magnetic moment in non - zero magnetic field should be different .",
    "clockwise electric current @xmath5 can be obtained from anticlockwise current @xmath5 with the help of the turning - over of the loop , fig.1cl .",
    "it is well known that we should expand the energy @xmath60 in order the rotate the magnetic dipole moment @xmath75 in magnetic field @xmath61 @xcite . `` but when we go over to the hamiltonian formalism by the standard canonical procedure , the total hamiltonian @xmath76 turns out to be just the kinetic energy @xmath77 ! where has the magnetic energy gone ? '' @xcite .",
    "anthony leggett has surmised soundly that `` perhaps our naive tendency to identify the hamiltonian with the energy is ( as in some cases involving time - dependent forces ) misleading ? '' @xcite .",
    "indeed , the energy of electric current circulating in a perfect conductor deduced from the classical hamiltonian ( 16.10 ) in @xcite @xmath78 turns out to be just the kinetic energy @xmath79 at weak screening @xmath80 as well as in the quantum case ( 6 ) .",

    "the energy ( 9 ) deduced from the history ( involving time - dependent forces ) of the state equals the energy @xmath87 of magnetic dipole moment @xmath88 in magnetic field @xmath3 .",
    "this energy is positive when @xmath89 and negative when @xmath90 in ( 9 ) .",
    "thus the total energy of the current circulating in the loop with the section @xmath42 is the sum @xmath91 of the kinetic energy ( 8) and the energy of magnetic dipole moment in magnetic field ( 9 ) .",
    "this energy can be easily deduced for any case when magnetic field @xmath86 appears after the current @xmath82 because the current @xmath82 constant in time has no influence on the energy expended by a power source producing the magnetic field .",
    "it is obvious this energy must have the same value when the current @xmath82 appears after magnetic field @xmath86 .",
    "the energy @xmath92 is provided in this case by the power source producing the magnetic flux due to the mutual inductance .",
    "this energy can be easily calculated in few cases , for example when the mutual inductance @xmath93 between two loops equals the inductance @xmath94 , @xmath95 of each of the loops .",
    "the equalities @xmath96 take place when the magnetic flux inside the loop is induced with the help of a similar loop , located side by side , fig.2qu .",

    "qu : the first ( external ) loop creates magnetic flux @xmath99 .",
    "the electric field @xmath100 should be induced in this loop during appearing of the persistent current @xmath101 in the second loop after transition of its normal segment ( black ) in superconducting state .",
    "this electric field should have opposite direction at the transition into superconducting states with different quantum number @xmath30 and @xmath102 because of opposite direction of the current @xmath5 .",
    "therefore the power source should expend different energy @xmath103 and @xmath104 in order to maintain the current @xmath105 . ]",
    "this case is important for a deduction of the @xmath92 energy in the quantum case because the persistent current appears after magnetic flux .",
    "the electric current exists due to the power source in the classical case shown on fig.1cl , fig.2cl and due to the quantization ( 2 ) in the quantum case shown on fig.1qu , fig.2qu .",
    "clockwise electric current @xmath5 can not be obtained from anticlockwise current @xmath5 with the help of the rotation operation of the loop in the quantum case , in contrast to the classical one , fig.1cl .",
    "the persistent current ( 4 ) @xmath107 , existing due to the quantization ( 2 ) , will change with the loop @xmath1 rotation on the angle @xmath108 relatively the @xmath3 direction .",
    "the rotation operation of the loop on the angle @xmath109 can not change the @xmath5 direction relatively the @xmath3 direction and the total energy expended during this rotation equals zero .",
    "the reversal of the @xmath5 direction is assumed due to quantum tunneling @xcite or quantum superposition @xcite in the case of flux qubit and due to the transition into the normal state , fig.1qu , of a loop segment @xcite or whole loop without josephson junctions @xcite .",
    "the change of the quantum number from @xmath30 to @xmath102 changes the current direction , fig.1qu , as well as the turning - over of the loop with the invariable current , fig.1cl . according to the law of energy conservation the expenses of energy",
    "should not depend on the way of the current reversal .",
    "this requirement was proved above in the case when magnetic field appears after the current , fig.2cl .",
    "it may be proved also in the classical case when the current appears after magnetic field .",
    "the power source inducing the magnetic flux @xmath99 with the help of the first loop should expend the additional energy @xmath110 when other power source ( it is not shown on fig.2qu ) induces the current @xmath111 in the second loop .",
    "we can describe completely this process in the classical case using the newton s second law @xmath112 for the both loops .",
    "but we can not use the newton s second law in the quantum case , shown on fig.2qu .",
    "we can describe completely using the newton s second law the transition from @xmath113 to @xmath114 ( from left to central picture on fig.1qu ) after switching of a loop segment in normal state .",
    "the electrical current decays exponentially from @xmath113 to @xmath114 and the velocity of the mobile charge carriers goes down to zero under influence of the dissipation force @xmath115 .",
    "we can write the newton s second law @xmath116 for mobile charge carriers in all loop segments after the transition into normal state .",
    "but we can not write it for the process ( from central to right picture on the fig.2qu ) of the @xmath5 appearance after the reversion of the loop segment into the superconducting state @xcite .",
    "quantum mechanics states that the mobile charge carriers should accelerate because of the quantization ( 2 ) .",
    "but no theory says which force accelerates these carriers against the electric field force @xmath117 .",
    "this puzzle is consequence of the well - known difference between perfect conductivity and superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the classical case , fig.1cl , fig.2cl , in our paper corresponds to perfect conductivity , whereas the quantum case , fig.1qu , fig.2qu , corresponds to superconductivity .",
    "behaviour of superconductor loop does not differ from the one of a perfect conductor when the wave function describing superconducting state is broken , for example with a power source , fig.1cl , fig.2cl , or normal state , fig.1qu , fig.2qu .",
    "the meissner effect is the first and most evident experimental evidence of the difference between perfect conductivity and superconductivity .",
    "meissner and ochsenfeld found that not only a magnetic field is excluded from entering a superconductor , as might appear to be explained by perfect conductivity , but also that a field in an originally normal sample is expelled as it is cooled through @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "the meissner effect is the first experimental evidence that superconductivity in contrast to perfect conductivity contradicts to lenz s law @xcite .",
    "jorge hirsch wonders fairly : `` _ strangely , the question of what is the force propelling the mobile charge carriers and the ions in the superconductor to move in direction opposite to the electromagnetic force in the meissner effect was essentially never raised nor answered to my knowledge _ '' @xcite .",
    "cooper pairs should move in direction opposite to the electromagnetic force also in the loop shown on fig.1qu .",
    "cooper pairs in an upper segment should accelerate when the lower segment marked black on the central picture of fig.2qu is switched from normal to superconducting state .",
    "this puzzle seems quite mysterious because the force propelling the mobile charge carriers in the distant segment must be non - local @xcite . this unknown force should choose a quantum number @xmath62 or @xmath71 and direction in which it will accelerate cooper pairs , i.e. left or right picture shown on fig.1qu .",
    "this puzzle seems especially unsolvable in the case of mechanical closing of a superconducting loop considered in the end of the paper @xcite .",
    "a mechanical force should act between boundaries of the josephson junction interrupting the loop at @xmath119 and @xmath120 because the value of the persistent current @xmath121 and as consequence its energy ( 6 ) should depend on the gap @xmath122 between the boundaries .",
    "one can calculate this force using a dependence of the critical current @xmath123 on @xmath122 .",
    "this force should be zero at any gap @xmath124 when magnetic flux inside the loop @xmath125 because the persistent current @xmath126 .",
    "but the persistent current ( 4 ) can not be zero because of the quantization ( 4 ) at @xmath127 .",
    "thus , a force providing the @xmath5 appearance should be not only non - local but also infinite .",
    "we doubt that such magical force could be introduced in any theory .",
    "at least , such force is unknown now .",
    "therefore nobody can say what power provides the kinetic energy in the quantum case shown on fig.2qu , in contrast to the classical case , fig.2cl .",
    "the kinetic energy can not be deduced from the history of quantum current state .",
    "but the energy of magnetic dipole moment @xmath92 seems to be deduced from the history .",
    "the power source inducing the magnetic flux should expend an additional energy @xmath128 ( 10 ) because of the additional flux @xmath129 induced in the first loop by the current @xmath54 of the second loop , fig.2qu .",
    "experiments testify that the persistent current induces this additional magnetic flux @xmath130 both in superconducting loop @xcite and flux qubit @xcite .",
    "no theory can describe how this flux change in time from @xmath131 at @xmath132 to @xmath133 at @xmath134 .",
    "but this flux must change in time and induce the electric field @xmath135 in the first loop .",
    "therefore the power source inducing the magnetic flux should expend the additional energy @xmath136 ( 10 ) in order to provide zero electric field @xmath84 and to maintain the current @xmath137 .",
    "thus , our naive tendency to identify the hamiltonian with the energy is misleading both in classical and quantum cases .",
    "the idea of flux qubit are based on this naive tendency .",
    "quantum superposition and quantum tunneling seem unthinkable between states with macroscopically different energy @xmath138 .",
    "this puzzle together with the law of angular momentum conservation @xcite call the idea of flux qubit in question .",
    "the naive tendency to identify the hamiltonian with the energy at the description of quantization effects in superconductors is upheld with numerous experimental results .",
    "most of these results can be described only if the energy @xmath92 of magnetic moment in an externally produced magnetic field is not taken into account . taking this energy into account has most destroying influence on the agreement between theory and experiment in the case of weak screening . according to the universally recognized theory @xcite the quantum periodicity in the transition temperature @xcite and in other parameters @xcite",
    "is observed at measurements of superconducting cylinder or ring because of change at @xmath49 of the quantum number @xmath62 corresponding to the minimal energy : this number @xmath51 at @xmath139 and @xmath53 at @xmath140 .",
    "but the total energy @xmath141 of the persistent current ( 4 ) should not have minimal values in these cases .",
    "the agreement between theory and experiment may be spurious .",
    "according to the law of conservation , energy of a state is the energy expended for a creation of this state .",
    "we use this definition of energy .",
    "one can not doubt that the identification of the hamiltonian with the energy is misleading in the classical case , fig.1cl , fig.2cl , because all experimental results corroborate that the energy of magnetic moment in magnetic field exists in this case .",
    "but in the quantum case experimental results give mutually contradictory evidences .",
    "measurements of the magnetic moment @xcite and magnetic flux @xcite induced by the persistent current testify that the energy of magnetic moment in magnetic field should exist also in the quantum case . but the quantum periodicity in different parameters observed in superconductor @xcite and normal metal @xcite loops can be described if only this energy is absent .",
    "this contradiction concerning the energy of magnetic moment of the persistent current both in theory and experiment demands attention and solution .",
    "no all experimental results can be described even if the hamiltonian is identified with the energy . some experimental results",
