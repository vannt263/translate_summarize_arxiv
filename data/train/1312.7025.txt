    "the primary goal of this paper is to describe the potential of a new economic modelling environment , populated by multi - layered agents , hierarchical objects that probe the boundary between individual and group , institution and society . bypassing questions of aggregation",
    ", the proposed paradigm seeks coordination through hierarchical , heterogeneous agents , influencing one - another through their opinions and actions .",
    "importantly , the agents limited rationality permits pockets of inconsistent allegiances to percolate through their interaction network .",
    "the proposed modeling environment extends work over the past decade on agent - based models of the economy [ 21,20,8,17 ] .",
    "progressively , such models have shown how heterogeneities in the agents endowments , preferences and interactions can persist and lead to observable deviations from the _ efficient market hypothesis _ , a collection of so - called _ stylized facts _ [ 16,13,18,7,26,2 ] .",
    "the extension proposed here invites us to broaden our notion of heterogeneity to encompass attributes that are nt reducible to individuals , but instead arise at different levels of aggregation .",
    "but instead of seeking to extract them from properties of the individuals , we posit them as part of the evolving state of ` meta - individualist ' , multi - layer agents that populate the economy [ 19,31 ] .    to illustrate this broader modelling paradigm , we proceed to extend a specific agent - based model of the economy , first proposed by bornholdt and subsequently studied both numerically and analytically by different authors [ 22,32 ] .",
    "this model is based on an interaction potential that trades off two components , the desire to belong to a local majority and simultaneously to the global minority .",
    "these two terms are balanced by a _",
    "coupling constant _",
    "the study of the statistical mechanics of this model led to the identification of an explicit phase transition [ 32 ] , controlled by @xmath0 , whereby sufficiently strong coupling leads to non - self - averaging behavior [ 3,4 ] and persistent opinion mixing .",
    "furthermore , this framework allowed us to identify a fundamental , irreducible limit to the observability of various measures of excess demand [ 32 ] .",
    "in the original bornholdt model , states of the economy were represented by spin configurations of a fixed lattice , or network more generally .",
    "configurations of this kind can be denoted by vectors of @xmath1s and @xmath2s , @xmath3 , for some @xmath4 .",
    "these vectors are then propagated following a markov process , driven by an interaction potential , @xmath5 .",
    "the resulting stochastic evolution is seeking minimum energy states , which represent equilibria .",
    "this minimization is controlled by a ` temperature ' parameter , in an analogy to the simulated annealing process of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics . at high temperatures ,",
    "state transitions are largely random .",
    "as the temperature is lowered , transitions that locally reduce the interaction potential are progressively favored . in the _ frozen _ phase ,",
    "the system picks out some equilibrium state , and is subsequently trapped there .",
    "this framework is often interpreted as describing the evolution of individual agents , represented by the different sites on the lattice or network , with the spins at each site denoting the evolving opinions or actions ( buys vs. sells ) of the agent on that site .",
    "however , such an interpretation , which attempts to reduce the resulting market dynamics to the interactions of individual agents , has come repeatedly under fire , from different perspectives [ 23,19 ] .",
    "most problematic , from the point of view of the current paper , is the inability of this framework to reproduce any of the myriad intermediate structures , from coalitions to firms , that populate the real economic landscape .",
    "more precisely , present instantiations of this paradigm reserve heterogeneity for individual agents , relegating any higher structures to the realm of transient epiphenomena .    here",
    ", we propose to extend the standard spin market framework in an explicit effort to bring out the irreducible relevance of structures in the economy .",
    "we choose to see these intermediate structures as endowed properties of the economic state , largely indecomposable to their constituents , albeit spontaneously evolving , in interaction among themselves and their constituents . to help visualize our proposed scheme , we propose the following abstraction : agents are analogous to simplicial complexes in topology , consisting of locally matching components of different dimensionality and degree of complexity [ 27 ] .",
    "such an object is generally indecomposable to a listing of its constituents .",
    "instead , it depends crucially on details of the ` gluing map ' that put it together . extending the analogy further",
    ", we posit a generalized interaction potential , which allows such hierarchical objects to ` act ' on one - another , without this action being describable as the interaction between individual components , e.g. an edge interacting with an edge or a tetrahedron interacting with a triangle .",
    "the goal of this work is to introduce this new modeling paradigm , in which the agents and the network on which their opinions evolve are indissolubly coupled . unlike earlier agent - based studies of economic interactions , we do nt attempt to generate a price process that can be calibrated against empirical statistics .",
    "the translation of agents opinions to observable aggregates depends sensitively on market microstructure , from details of the double - auction to explicit market making [ 9,31,1,6 ] .",
    "instead , the current work focuses on the rich array of stochastic convergence effects that arise in models of heterogeneous economic agent , particularly when we endogenies the evolution of the interaction network [ 15,11 ] . specifically , while much emphasis has been placed on conditions for guaranteeing ergodicity [ 5,28 ] , the focus here is on the effective lack of ergodicity under certain parametric regimes for our model , and its economic consequences , both theoretical and empirical . along the way , we introduce techniques from symbolic dynamics and the spectral analysis of markov chains to enrich the economic toolkit .",
    "we begin with an introduction to our hierarchical agent model , including a description of the interaction potential that couples the spin configurations on the nodes and arcs of our evolving network .",
    "this interaction potential drives a markov process whose hypergeometric state transitions are described in section 3 , along with some sample paths that hint at the non - ergodic behavior we are after .",
    "the following section introduces the contingent submartingale representation , a technique that allows us to extract a deterministic skeleton underlying our stochastic dynamics .",
    "we then proceed to investigate the invariant measure of the markov process and its sensitivity to the model s parameters .",
    "the discrepancies between the limiting distribution and the deterministic attractors we identified earlier leads us to pursue a spectral analysis of the underlying markov chain , which uncovers and quantifies a source of persistent path dependence .",
    "the paper concludes with a set of phenomenological conjectures that govern the paths of our hierarchical agent model , as well as a putative socioeconomic interpretation [ 10 ] for the three distinct dynamic regimes that the model exhibits .",
    "all along , we relegate the more technically demanding details of our exposition to an appendix .",
    "more concretely , we proceed to describe in detail an extension of the earlier bornholdt spin market model , where the states of the economy are represented by an object with two components : binary configurations on sites and arcs . to begin with",
    ", there is a set of sites @xmath6 for some @xmath4 and a related set of arcs @xmath7 .",
    "the first component of the state of the economy are spin configurations of sites , i.e. vectors of @xmath1s and @xmath2s , @xmath8 , while the second component are spin configurations over the set of arcs , @xmath9 .",
    "thus , the state can be described as @xmath10,\\ ] ] as shown in the examples illustrated in figure [ fig : examples ] .",
    "let @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the number of positive sites and arcs respectively . for notational convenience ,",
    "we extend @xmath13 to the whole @xmath14 , by imposing symmetry , i.e. @xmath15 for all @xmath16 .",
    ".,width=384 ]    we construct a continuous time markov process with transitions occurring at exponentially distributed epochs , @xmath17 , with rate @xmath18 [ 14 ] . at time",
    "@xmath17 ( i.e. the @xmath19 epoch ) a random member of @xmath20 is chosen uniformly and its spin is changed to @xmath2 or @xmath1 depending on interactions between the two components of the current market configuration .",
    "these interactions between these two components of the objects that populate our model rely on a tradeoff between the desire to align with the majority within a local neighborhood and a need to react to the opportunities created by global imbalance . the neighborhood structure of sites is based on the current configuration of the arcs , and vice versa , exploiting the duality between sites and arcs .",
    "in fact , as we will discuss in more detail later , this is one of the special features of our two - tiered agent that we explicitly exploit , and which is substantially more convoluted in higher - order extensions of our framework .    more specifically , let @xmath21 denote a mapping that assigns to every site @xmath22 and every epoch @xmath17 a subset @xmath23 of @xmath24 given by @xmath25 similarly , let @xmath26 denote a mapping that assigns to every arc @xmath27 and every epoch @xmath17 a subset @xmath28 of @xmath29 given by @xmath30 , where @xmath31    the treatment of the model presented in this paper is based on applying a version of ` rapid stirring ' [ 12 ] by randomizing the neighborhood structure generated by @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "appendix 1 provides more details about how these random neighborhoods are drawn .",
    "once the neighborhoods have been assigned for each site and arc at a point in time , each member of each neighborhood is mapped to @xmath2 or @xmath1 using further hypergeometric random variables , independent of the earlier ones and of each other , with as many draws as there are members of the neighborhood under consideration .",
    "these draws are without replacement , out of a population which depends on whether the chosen element is a site or an arc , and number of successes depending on the sign of the base site or arc . in particular , the interaction potential for site @xmath34 and arc @xmath27 is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 measures the global imbalance , in sites and arcs .",
    "the dynamics of the state proceed as follows .",
    "we set a temperature parameter , which controls the amount of randomization that interferes with the minimization of the interaction potentials described in ( [ eq : potentials ] ) above . as usual , we denote by @xmath37 the inverse temperature , and eventually we let it increase towards infinity . at every point in time @xmath38 , a site or arc is chosen uniformly at random and a coin is flipped .",
    "the chosen site or arc is assigned a @xmath2 if the coin comes up heads and @xmath1 otherwise .",
    "if site @xmath34 is chosen , then the probability that the coin comes up heads is equal to @xmath39 on the other hand , if arc @xmath40 is chosen , then the probability that the coin comes up heads is equal to @xmath41 note that , naturally , arcs are chosen more often than sites , because there are quadratically more arcs than sites , but in the long run , this imbalance in refresh rates guarantees that the more arcs will have had an equal opportunity of settling down to their invariant marginal distribution as the significantly fewer sites .",
    "in order to proceed with our analysis , we will compute the probabilities that at any point in time , the site or arc that is chosen will not change its sign .",
    "we will restrict our attention to the ` frozen phase ' , i.e. we will consider the limit @xmath42 .",
    "this choice simplifies our analysis because , in this limit , all ` thermal ' randomness , which would oppose the minimization of the interaction potential , disappears , and the only randomness that remains stems from the sampling of random neighborhoods .",
    "this persistent randomization gives rise to hypergeometric random variables .",
    "more precisely , consider @xmath43 , the probability that , having chosen a @xmath2 site , it remains @xmath2 after the update , assuming the system is in a state with @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "let @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the _ floor _ of @xmath48 , i.e. the largest integer no greater than @xmath48 .",
    "then , the site transition probability @xmath43 is given by the following partial sum of conditionally hypergeometric random variables : @xmath49 where @xmath50 @xmath51 and @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "more details about the derivation of these transition probabilities are given in appendix 2 .",
    "similarly the probability @xmath54 that , having chosen a @xmath1 site , it remains @xmath1 after the update , assuming the system is in a state with @xmath44 and @xmath45 , is based on guaranteeing that @xmath55 and is given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the _ ceiling _ of @xmath48 , i.e. the smallest integer no less than @xmath48 .",
    "on the other hand , if we choose an arc instead of a site , the computation is somewhat different .",
    "as before , we are looking to compute the probability , @xmath61 that , having chosen a @xmath2 arc , it remains @xmath2 after the update , assuming the system is in a state with @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "let @xmath62 and @xmath63 then , the arc transition probability @xmath64 is given by the following partial sum of conditionally hypergeometric random variables : @xmath65    similarly , if the chosen arc is @xmath1 , the probability that it remains negative after the update is given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 the technical details of these derivations are also described in appendix 2 .",
    "we can perform a monte carlo simulation based on the expressions ( [ eq : ppp ] ) , ( [ eq : pmm ] ) , ( [ eq : qpp ] ) and ( [ eq : qmm ] ) . in particular",

    "@xmath75.,width=480 ]    this markov chain is a form of two - dimensional random walk in a random environment ( rwre ) , i.e. a random walk in which the probability of going up / down and left / right depends on your current location [ 12 ] .",
    "such stochastic processes may exhibit path dependence and lack of ergodicity , as supported by the simulation of the same markov chain shown in figure [ fig : mc2 ] .     and",
    "@xmath75 , started at a different point.,width=480 ]    this simulation also lasts for @xmath73 steps , and the parameters are identical with the earlier simulation .",
    "the only difference is that this time the simulation was started at @xmath80 and @xmath81 . instead of becoming trapped in the attractor @xmath79 , this time the markov chain appears to be stochastically switching between two states , one with @xmath82 and another with @xmath83 .",
    "this phenomenology is consistent with a non - ergodic process , for which the dependence on initial conditions does nt disappear in the @xmath84 limit .",
    "one of the most prominent characteristics of empirical price series is their long range memory [ 9,1 ]",
    ". this can indicate path - dependence , a tell - tale sign of non - ergodicity in the underlying process . in lieu of generating price dynamics , which could be compared with empirically determined statistics ,",
    "we explore the serial correlation of the @xmath85 and @xmath86 paths generated by our process for signs of similar qualitative behavior .",
    "we quantify the serial correlation using the modified r / s index [ 25,24 ] .",
    "this index is a function of a delay window , @xmath87 , and is normalized so that when its value is equal to @xmath88 for a particular delay , the process is memoryless at that horizon . on the other hand , when the r / s index is more than @xmath88 , the process exhibits persistent behavior , while values of the index below @xmath88 indicate anti - persistent behavior , at the corresponding horizons .     and @xmath86 exhibit persistent serial correlation , as shown by the slowly decaying r / s index .",
    "the lower edge corresponds to a value of r / s equal to @xmath88 .",

    "note that the figure is cropped so that the bottom edge corresponds to a value of @xmath88 .",
    "in all three cases @xmath93 and the markov chain was started at @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "three different values of @xmath0 were used : @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 respectively . in the first and the last case , both @xmath85 and @xmath86 exhibit strong persistence even at @xmath97 . in the middle case , the memory disappears for both @xmath85 and @xmath86 after about @xmath98 and @xmath99 steps respectively .",
    "it is worth noting that in all cases the arc process has longer memory than the site process .    to further explore the long range memory of our stochastic process",
    ", we ran @xmath100 monte carlo simulations with @xmath73 steps each , all started at @xmath80 and @xmath81 , with six different values of @xmath0 .",

    "more than @xmath102 of the data remain persistently serially correlated even beyond the @xmath103 step horizon , indicating a remarkably long memory , which may well contribute to the observed long memory of empirical economic price series .    in what follows",
    ", we will employ a novel methodology to probe the dynamical attractors of this stochastic process .",
    "this technique , based on a _ contingent submartingale representation _ [ 33 ] , will allow us to construct a _ cellular automaton _ [ 34 ] approximation of the full stochastic dynamics , identify all equilibria of this deterministic dynamical system and examine their stability properties . for linear stochastic systems , the resulting deterministic paths act as a ` skeleton ' around which the stochastic state paths oscillate , ultimately converging to invariant measures supported in the neighborhoods of the deterministic attractors .    , the r / s index remained above @xmath88 more than @xmath104 of the time for both @xmath85 ( blue circles ) and @xmath86 ( red diamonds ) .",

    "in order to analyze the long term behavior of this decidedly complicated , inhomogeneous markov chain , we begin by characterizing the conditional expectation of the increments of this process in each dimension .",

    "incidentally , the fractional factors in front of the conditional expectations reflect the fact that the moves in @xmath111 will be either in the first ( @xmath85 ) or second ( @xmath86 ) dimension , not both simultaneously , with proportions @xmath112 , as we mentioned already at the end of section 2 . in other words , the arc configurations are updated more frequently than the site configurations , and therefore the conditional expectations of the increments of @xmath85 will be much lower than the ones for @xmath86 , and they both will be lower than they would have been if we allowed simultaneous moves in both directions .",
    "it is these latter ( simultaneous ) expected increments that the functions @xmath108 and @xmath109 compute , so they need to be adjusted accordingly , to bring the weighted averages in line .",
    "the reason why we chose to define the functions @xmath108 and @xmath109 in this way , despite the superficial conflict with the definition of our 2d stochastic process , is because we intend them to banish all stochasticity and represent the deterministic kernel around which the stochastic process evolves , as discussed in the last paragraph of section 3 .",
    "since both @xmath108 and @xmath109 depend on both components , they will generally point in directions that combine movement in both directions .",
    "had we insisted to choose one direction over the other at every step , we would have had to introduce some randomization scheme that chooses the directional signal from the pair of @xmath108 and @xmath109 to obey at every point in time .",
    "the only way to extract a completely deterministic dynamic is to accept the possibility of simultaneous ( though deterministic ) moves in both directions .",
    "more specifically , it is situations like this that gave rise to the concept of a _ contingent submartingale _ [ 33 ] .",
    "here we slightly generalize the definition given in [ 32 ] to accommodate our needs , even one involving this 1d process itself as one of the components of the 2d contingency criterion .",
    "but we adjust our notation of the contingent submartingale here to make this possibility more explicit , because it is of direct relevance . ] .",

    "it is conceivable that a non - lattice point equilibrium may be unstable in the context of the discrete dynamics because all neighboring lattice points are repelling .",
    "the second effect we need to consider is whether small perturbations would irreversibly escape the neighborhood of the putative attractor .",

    "specifically , for the markov transition matrix @xmath145 shown in ( [ eq : m ] ) , this eigenvector is given by @xmath149.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] returning to the more readily interpretable representation in the @xmath143 state space , the resulting invariant measure is given by @xmath150 where the horizontal axis corresponds to the number of sites that are @xmath2 , from @xmath151 to @xmath152 , while the vertical axis corresponds to the number of arcs that are @xmath2 , from @xmath151 to @xmath152 .",
    "this means that , for example , the steady state probability of finding the system in the state @xmath153 , i.e. with one site equal to @xmath2 and two arcs equal to @xmath2 is equal to @xmath154 .",
    "the most likely outcomes of this markov chain are the states @xmath155 and @xmath156 , while the states @xmath157 and @xmath158 are the least likely ones .",
    "appendix 3 describes the technical details involved in the appropriate convergence concepts for a markov chain .",
    "this discussion substantiates our use of linear algebra techniques to obtain information about the distributional path properties of @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "we now proceed to investigate the changes to the resulting invariant measure as @xmath0 and @xmath4 are allowed to vary .",
    "figure [ fig : invmeasure1 ] shows how the invariant measure evolves for @xmath93 as @xmath0 is allowed to increase .     and",
    "@xmath75 in the subcritical regime to @xmath159 in the supercritical regime . the critical transition for @xmath93 happens between @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "as @xmath0 increases in the supercritical regime , the invariant measure evolves from unimodal to bimodal and back to unimodal , with the mode moving from the left edge towards the middle of the state space.,width=672 ]    as a first observation , note that the case @xmath93 and @xmath75 , whose deterministic approximation gave rise to the four separate attractors we described in section 4 , possesses in fact a unique invariant measure , concentrated entirely at @xmath162 .",
    "in fact , we can easily verify , using ( [ eq : mctransitions ] ) , that when @xmath93 and @xmath75 , @xmath163 thereby guaranteeing that @xmath136 is a trapping state for the full stochastic dynamics .",
    "the only question that remains is one of ergodicity : might the corresponding markov transition matrix possess a double eigenvalue equal to 1 , in which case the two resulting eigenvectors will give rise to two distinct invariant measures , and the dynamics will be non - ergodic ?     and @xmath126 decay almost linearly , with @xmath164.,width=384 ]",
    "figure [ fig : spectrum1 ] shows the rate of decay of the eigenvalues for the transition matrix in this case .",
    "figure [ fig : spectrum2 ] shows the pattern generated by the location of the eigenvalues in the unit disc .",
    "it turns out that the second highest eigenvalue is extremely close to @xmath18 , at about @xmath165 !     and @xmath126 in the unit disc .",
    "the four panels progressively zoom in to the spectral gap in a clockwise manner .",
    "the spectral gap is indeed very small , only equal to @xmath166.,width=384 ]",
    "thus , we know that the invariant measure is unique , despite the multiplicity of attractors for the deterministic cellular automaton approximation . why is that , and what can we infer from the nearness of the second eigenvalue to 1 ? there are two justifications for the discrepancy between these two apparently contradictory asymptotic behaviors .",
    "the first hinges on the observation , which we mentioned at the end of section 3 , that the deterministic cellular automaton does nt in fact provide a skeleton around which the markov chain evolves . instead ,",
    "these two dynamics deviate from one another systematically , in very instructive ways :    * propagating the average is not the same as the average of the propagated measure . * rounding the state to the nearest integer does nt respect the sign of the expected increments .",
    "the sources of these discrepancies are discussed in detail in appendix 4 .    despite these important ways in which the underlying stochastic process deviates meaningfully from the deterministic cellular automaton approximation , in practice economic agents often use such approximation schemes . specifically , stochastic dynamics are not uncommonly interpreted ` quasi - deterministically ' , taking one step at a time , depending on the sign of signals on average , rather than propagate the ensemble of paths with their respective probabilities and subsequently take the average .",
    "we saw the first justification for the deviation in asymptotic behaviors of the markov chain and the deterministic cellular automaton . according to it ,",
    "we really did nt have much reason to expect that they would approximate one another in the first place !",
    "the second justification for their deviation instead focuses on their hidden similarities , delving deeper into the interpretation of the spectrum of the transition matrix .",
    "specifically , as documented even in figures [ fig : mc1 ] and [ fig : mc2 ] , the markov chain with @xmath93 and @xmath126 does nt converge to its invariant measure for a long time : in the first figure it took about @xmath78 steps , and in the second figure it did nt converge until after @xmath73 steps .",
    "moreover , in both cases the markov chain spent most of the time oscillating in the vicinity of two states , around @xmath167 and @xmath168 , occasionally switching between them .",
    "we have already seen in table 1 that these are in fact stable periodic attractors of the deterministic cellular automaton .",
    "so the cellular automaton , despite being a lousy asymptotic approximation , is evidently quite accurate in describing the time evolution of particular paths of the stochastic process .",
    "why is this ?",
    "in fact , the reason for the transient , though long - lasting , relevance of the cellular automaton is the exceedingly slow converge rate of the markov chain for @xmath93 and @xmath75 , which is due to its near - non - ergodicity . as we already saw , the second highest eigenvalue is roughly within a millionth of @xmath18 .",
    "if it were equal to @xmath18 , then the markov chain would lose ergodicity , and the asymptotic multiplicity of attractors exhibited by the cellular automaton would dominate the asymptotic behavior of the stochastic system as well . as it is , this is averted , but only by the slightest of margins .",
    "in fact , the convergence rate of an ergodic markov chain to its unique invariant measure is controlled exponentially by the second highest eigenvalue , @xmath169 . more specifically [ 30 ] , for any function @xmath170 , the variance of the expectation of @xmath171 under the measure @xmath172 falls with @xmath38 as @xmath173 . in the case of @xmath93 and @xmath75 , this remains high for a very long time .    for comparison , @xmath174 when @xmath93 and @xmath175 .",
    "this would take @xmath176 steps to half the variation distance ] ] from the invariant measure , while the @xmath93 , @xmath75 case we considered above would take @xmath177 steps to reach the same approach to the invariant measure ! as a result of this effect , we ever only get to experience the transient regime of the markov chain for @xmath93 and @xmath75 .",
    "when @xmath93 and @xmath75 .",
    "the axes have been cropped because the eigenvector is dominated by a positive peak in the neighborhood of @xmath167 and a negative peak at @xmath136 .",
    "this figure shows that there is a ridge connecting the vicinity of @xmath167 and that of @xmath168.,width=336 ]     for @xmath93 and @xmath75 . at this cropping ,",
    "the two peaks that dominate the transient behavior are clearly recognizable , as is the ridge the connects them , along which the system occasionally transitions . at the corner near @xmath136 , which constitutes the peak of the invariant measure and",
    "has been cropped out , we are beginning to discern a shallow slope , which represents the last barrier before the trapping state at @xmath136 is reached .",
    "the lower left panel illustrates the contour lines of the 3d figures , clearly depicting the paths along which the process will eventually become channeled towards the invariant measure.,width=624 ]    figures [ fig : spectrum3 ] and [ fig : spectrum4 ] illustrate the information gleaned from the eigenvector associated with the second highest eigenvalue , @xmath169 .",
    "these visualization tools substantiate our view of the markov chain ` mixing ' the attractors of the deterministic cellular automaton approximation .",
    "rather than irrelevant , the cellular automaton , and the contingent submartingale method that motivated it , cast useful light on the transient behavior of the markov chain , which in this instance is arguably more relevant than its invariant measure , which wo nt be reached for an inordinate amount of time .",
    "armed with the techniques and insights form the previous two sections , we are now in a position to describe the qualitative changes that the invariant measure experiences as the two parameters @xmath4 and @xmath0 are varied .    1 .   for every @xmath4 there exists a critical value of the coupling constant @xmath178 that separates the sub - critical from the super - critical regime of the markov chain .",
    "this is analogous to the critical phase transition described in [ 32 ] . in this instance",
    ", the subcritical regime entails a unique invariant measure concentrated at the trapping state @xmath179 .",
    "the super - critical regime on the other hand entails a unique distribution with broad support .",
    "more specifically , we conjecture that for all @xmath4 there exists a value @xmath178 such that for all @xmath180 , @xmath181 and for all @xmath182 , @xmath183 \\ne { \\bf e}^{\\pi_\\infty } \\left [ s^+ \\right ] { \\bf e}^{\\pi_\\infty } \\left [ a^+ \\right].\\ ] ] 2 .",
    "as corroborated by figure [ fig : invmeasure1 ] , the critical value @xmath178 is lower than @xmath184 . in fact we conjecture that @xmath185 .",
    "3 .   as @xmath0 increases past @xmath178 ,",
    "the invariant measure is initially bimodal , a dominant one in the vicinity of @xmath186 and a substantially shallower one around @xmath187 .",
    "we conjecture that @xmath188 4 .",
    "progressively , as @xmath0 is increased , mass is transferred from the former mode to the latter one , and the latter mode slowly slides up towards @xmath189 .",
    "asymptotically as @xmath190 the invariant measure remains broadly supported , and becomes symmetric around a unique peak in the vicinity of @xmath189 .",
    "specifically , we conjecture that there exists a @xmath191 , such that @xmath192 5 .   as @xmath4 increases ,",
    "the eventual mixing in the super - critical regime requires larger increases in @xmath0 .",
    "this effect is illustrated in figure [ fig : invmeasure2 ] .",
    "we conjecture that for every @xmath4 there exists a second critical value of the coupling constant , @xmath193 , such that for all @xmath194 , @xmath195 becomes unimodal once more .",
    "moreover , we conjecture that @xmath196 6 .   for every @xmath4 ,",
    "the spectral gap is an increasing function of @xmath0 .",
    "specifically we conjecture that it is a power law , with two branches , separated by @xmath178 , i.e. that there exist positive constants @xmath197 and @xmath198 such that for any @xmath199 , @xmath200 7 .   returning to the sub - critical regime",
    "we saw that the behavior of the markov chain is dominated by the transient regime because of extremely high @xmath169 .",
    "moreover we saw that the attractors of the deterministic cellular automaton approximation coincided with the structure of the eigenvector corresponding to @xmath169 , guiding the markov chain to occasionally transition among the stable attractors of the cellular automaton .",
    "the inexorable convergence to the trapping state does nt materialize until times arguably beyond practical relevance .",
    "we conjecture that this behavior is characteristic of the sub - critical regime .     and @xmath0 in the supercritical regime",
    ". the second critical transition appears to occur for @xmath201 as @xmath4 increases .",
    "but when it occurs , it appears to follow the same pattern of evolution.,width=672 ]    finally , we proceed to offer a speculative interpretation of the distributional properties of this markov chain that represents the interactions of hierarchical economic agents . in order to draw economically relevant conclusions",
    ", we introduce the concepts of _ connectivity _ , _ conservatism _ and _ conformity _ , along with the opposite respective poles , _ fragmentation _ , _ liberalism _ and _ individualism_. in our model , we interpret the site spins as acceptance ( @xmath2 ) or rejection ( @xmath1 ) of a new idea ( along the conservatism to liberalism dimension ) , and the arc spins as acceptance ( @xmath2 ) or rejection ( @xmath1 ) of a social connection that enhances cohesion .",
    "finally , we interpret the coupling constant @xmath0 , which serves to modulate the tradeoff between the pursuit of local majority and that of global minority , as a measure of conformity : low @xmath0 represents societies where people prioritize conforming to group norms , while high values of @xmath0 represent societies where people prioritize seizing opportunities for speculative contrarian actions .    with this interpretative framework in mind , we can draw the following three conclusions , inspired by the qualitative properties of the distributions that arise from our interacting hierarchical agents :    1 .",
    "societies with a high desire for uniformity are driven towards broad , multilateral connectivity and uniform liberalism .",
    "this represents the trapping state equilibrium in the sub - critical regime of our model .",
    "2 .   as the relevance of individualism increases in a society",
    ", we see the highest structural diversity in outcomes , dominated by uniform conservatism and centralized connectivity .",
    "this represents intermediate values of @xmath0 , just past the phase transition , and the resulting multimodal distributions .",
    "societies with a high degree of individualistic opportunism , become tolerant of diversity of opinions and fragmented into local islands of social cohesion .",
    "this represents the eventually unimodal , broadly supported distributions we obtain asymptotically as @xmath0 increases further .",
    "this scheme for interpreting the qualitative conclusions of our study is but a caricature .",
    "nevertheless , they bear some striking similarities with socioeconomic systems in various historical and contemporary settings",
    ". it may be the case that further elaboration of these parallels between our model and socioeconomic concepts will substantiate these tentative suggestions .",
    "research in this direction appears warranted .",
    "in summary , we defined a stochastic process on meta - individual agents that we represent as spin configurations of sites and arcs in a network that evolves as a result of their interactions . as such , this work can be seen as extending earlier work on spin market models and opinion formation models to the case of a network that evolves simultaneously and reciprocally with the agents actions .",
    "we were able to obtain analytic control of the invariant measure for the resulting stochastic process , and compare it with a deterministic cellular automaton that was designed to approximate it .",
    "our analysis shed light on questions of ergodicity and persistent transient effects .",
    "based on the novel analytic methodology we describe , a series of conjectures is offered , to help guide future work in this field .",
    "beyond the specific technical questions that are covered by these conjectures , larger next steps include the extension of the framework proposed here to more layers in the agents hierarchy , including objects beyond arcs , for instance ` faces ' or triples of sites .",
    "finally , another inviting direction for future work involves delineating the speculative socioeconomic interpretations offered at the end of the previous section",
    ". it would be worthwhile to attempt a historical / empirical investigation of the proposed parallels .",
    "for now , we must settle for the many more questions than answers that our study brought to light so far .",

    "this appendix describe the technical details of the derivation of the transition probabilities , @xmath226 , @xmath54 , @xmath61 and @xmath227 .",
    "in particular , our goal here is to show the origin of the conditionally hypergeometric random variables , whose partial sums are involved in the computation of the transition probabilities , as shown in section 3 .",
    "we begin with @xmath43 , the probability that , having chosen a @xmath2 site , it remains @xmath2 after the update , assuming the system is in a state with @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "this probability has two components .",
    "first , we need to compute the probability that the randomly chosen @xmath2 site has @xmath228 neighbors , and then the chance that @xmath125 of them are positive , in order to compute the ` local majority ' contribution to the interaction potential . using the hypergeometric distribution",
    ", we can see that the former is given by @xmath229 while the latter is given by @xmath230    the only thing that remains is to figure out the limits of the desirable range of values for @xmath228 and @xmath125 .",
    "our goal is to guarantee that @xmath231 , where @xmath232 is the chosen site , and since we ve assumed that the site is positive , this amounts to enforcing the inequality @xmath233 assuming that there are @xmath125 positive out of @xmath228 total neighbors for @xmath48 ( given the state @xmath234 ) , we see that @xmath235 .",
    "thus , given @xmath228 , we need @xmath125 to satisfy @xmath236 .",
    "we now turn our attention to the probability @xmath61 that , having chosen a @xmath2 arc , it remains @xmath2 after the update , assuming the system is in a state with @xmath44 and @xmath45 . as we saw in appendix 1 , the number of neighbors of an arc can be either @xmath151 , @xmath212 or @xmath237 , depending on whether none , one or both of its endpoints are @xmath2 sites respectively .",
    "clearly , the first case , in which both of the chosen arc s endpoints are @xmath1 sites , does nt contribute anything to this probability , because in that case the arc has no neighbors and therefore its interaction potential has no ` local majority ' component .",
    "the remaining ` global imbalance ' term in the interaction potential always has the opposite sign from the current sign of the site or arc under consideration , so it always makes the chosen site or arc flip its sign .",
    "focusing on the second case , in which the chosen arc has only one @xmath2 site as an endpoint , we see that this occurs with probability @xmath238 .",
    "the only question that remains is how many of the @xmath212 resulting neighbors to the chosen arc are themselves positive .",
    "the probability that @xmath125 out of the @xmath212 arc neighbors are positive is given by the hypergeometric distribution as @xmath239    similarly , in the final case , in which both endpoints of the chosen arc are @xmath2 sites , and therefore the chosen arc has @xmath237 neighbors , occurs with probability @xmath240 . finally , the probability that @xmath125 out of these @xmath241 arc neighbors are positive is computed again using the hypergeometric distribution as @xmath242    as before , our goal this time is that @xmath243 , where @xmath27 is the chosen arc .",
    "since we ve assumed that this chosen arc is positive , this condition is equivalent to the following inequality : @xmath244 in the case of @xmath212 neighbors , @xmath125 of which are positive , this becomes @xmath245 on the other hand , when the chosen arc has @xmath241 neighbors , @xmath125 of which are positive , the inequality becomes @xmath246 +   +",
    "this appendix provides the detailed formalism behind the convergence of the empirical measures of a markov chain and the questions of ergodicity that ensue . at this point",
    "we will introduce some notation to help clarify the nature of the relevant limiting behavior .",
    "let @xmath247 at inverse temperature @xmath37 and coupling constant @xmath0 .",
    "then @xmath248 and @xmath249 let @xmath250 be the markov transition matrix and @xmath251 be a probability measure , represented as a row ( i.e. dual , or co- ) vector with @xmath252 dimensions .",
    "in particular , we can represent any function @xmath253 as a vector @xmath254 with @xmath252 dimensions , and then the expected value of this function with respect to the probability measure @xmath255 is given by the inner product . ]",
    "@xmath256    the markov chain entails the propagation of the row vectors @xmath255 by the transition matrix @xmath257 .",
    "thus , starting with some initial co - vector @xmath258 , the markov chain can be described as the sequence of co - vectors @xmath259 . however , this propagation is difficult to interpret in terms of our stochastic process @xmath110 , because the one - dimensional row vectors of @xmath252 dimensions are actually representing two - dimensional distributions on a @xmath260 grid .",
    "the transformation between the 1d co - vector representation and the more readily interpretable representation as measures on this @xmath260 grid is effected by the functions @xmath261 and @xmath262 introduced in ( [ eq : ifunction ] ) and ( [ eq : jfunction ] ) respectively .",
