    "here , @xmath191 is equivalent to a rank - defect condition , and @xmath192 are conditions on the system hamiltonian .",
    "so the pbh conditions combined with the direct method of this paper can be used to characterize linear df modes .",

    "so far we have obtained a theory to characterize general dark modes . as shown in theorem  [ theoremd1 ] , the existence of dark modes is conditioned in terms of the environmental couplings and the system hamiltonian . in the next section ,",

    "it is easy to see that a weaker sufficient condition for @xmath210 to be not full column rank is that at least one column vector of @xmath211 lies in the column space of @xmath212 .",
