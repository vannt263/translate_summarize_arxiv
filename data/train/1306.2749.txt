    "initiated by the discovery of the cuprates , the search for new materials exhibiting unconventional superconductivity has become one of the major branches in condensed matter physics .",
    "the symmetry of the order parameter is tightly related to the symmetry of the crystal lattice and pairing mechanism .",
    "the bulk condensate is described by a generally tensorial _ complex _",
    "order parameter @xmath5 exhibiting a great variety of the broken symmetries ground states .",
    "generally a time reversal invariant non s - wave pairing results in nodes in @xmath6 space , namely the superconductivity is gapless and the complex nature of the order parameter does not come into play .",
    "however , when the time reversal is broken the excitation spectrum becomes gapped .",
    "generally two  real ( up to a @xmath6 independent phase ) nodal pairings @xmath7 and @xmath8 are combined into an essentially complex order parameter@xcite , @xmath9 .",
    "the reason is that nodes of both @xmath10 and @xmath11 appear typically along non intersecting lines of the momentum space .",
    "the first system with the gap arising from two nodal pairings was liquid @xmath12 @xcite that in the abm phase even exhibits the extreme case of that phenomenon , the so - called chiral superconductivity , characterized by presence of electron - hole symmetry and absence of both the time - reversal and spin - rotation symmetry . in this case @xmath13 and @xmath14 , so that @xmath15 with `` equal strength '' of the two components rotated by the @xmath16 phase `` exotic '' spin - triplet states . charged spin - triplet superfluids , like @xcite@xmath17 and heavy fermion compounds like @xmath18 were shown to have similar structure although it is not yet clear whether they are chiral .",
    "the recently discovered @xmath19-doped topological superconductor @xmath20 produces an equivalent chiral pseudospin system on its surface @xcite .",
    "the surface states in these materials attract much attention these days because they are recognized as majorana fermion bound states @xcite .",
    "less `` exotic '' spin - singlet gapped unconventional superconductors are @xmath21 wave with admixture of @xmath22 . although most popular high @xmath0 materials @xmath23 and @xmath24 are pure @xmath25 with probably small admixture@xcite of @xmath22 . the admixture was invoked early on by laughlin @xcite to explain the time reversal broken symmetry low - temperature phase observed in @xmath26 via heat transport experiment in external magnetic field @xcite , tanaka .",
    "similar transition was observed in ni - doped @xmath24 in zero external magnetic field .",
    "balatsky @xcite pointed out that , in the presence of magnetic impurities , the @xmath25 superconductor can exhibit a transition exactly into the @xmath27 state due to a coupling between the impurity magnetization and the @xmath28 component of the order parameter .",
    "topologically nontrivial superconducting state of two - dimensional electron system was discussed by kopaev _ _ et al.__@xcite in connection with the problem of pairing with large center - of - mass pair momentum under predominant repulsive screened coulomb interaction .",
    "direct numerical solution of the self - consistency equation exhibits two nearly degenerate order parameters @xmath25 and @xmath29 spontaneous breaking of the time - reversal symmetry can mix these states and form fully gapped chiral @xmath27 superconducting states .",
    "recently an stm evidence appeared @xcite of significant admixture of @xmath22 in @xmath30 doped @xmath31 .    theoretically a way to accomplish the mixing - of - components scenario ,",
    "the lattice can act as a custodial symmetry to ensure degeneracy of different superconducting instabilities .",
    "in such a case the degeneracy is linked to higher dimensional irreducible representations of the lattice symmetry group , and a chiral superposition of superconducting states can be energetically favorable below @xmath0 .",
    "cuprates ( with an exception of @xmath23 ) are fourfold symmetric .",
    "it was pointed out recently@xcite that for the square lattice and its @xmath32 group , there is no representation for singlet cooper pairs that could result in chiral superconductivity .",
    "this , however , changes for hexagonal systems , where the @xmath33 representation of the @xmath34 lattice symmetry group implies the degeneracy of the @xmath21 and @xmath28 wave state at the instability level which can yield a chiral @xmath27 singlet superconductor .",
    "degeneration of the @xmath21 and @xmath28 ordered states inherent in doped graphene monolayer has been recently considered by nandkishore _",
    "_ graphene as a possible origin of a rise of a singlet chiral superconducting ( sc ) state with @xmath27 orbital symmetry .",
    "chiral d- wave superconductivity ( chern number @xmath35 ) has been suggested in @xmath36@xmath37 , a novel heavy fermionic compound @xcite .",
    "note that all these systems have small fermi momentum @xmath38 of the order of magnitude of the inverse coherence length @xmath39 .",
    "magnetic fields in type ii superconducting film easily create stable line - like topological defects , abrikosov vortices@xcite . in the simplest vortex",
    "the phase of the order parameter rotates by @xmath40 around the vortex and each vortex carries a unit of magnetic flux @xmath41 .",
    "quasiparticles near the vortex core `` feel '' the phase wind by creating a set of discrete low - energy andreev bound states .",
    "for the @xmath42-wave superconductors when the vortices are unpinned ( freely moving ) these states were comprehensively studied theoretically including the excitations spectrum @xcite , density of states @xcite , their role in vortex viscosity@xcite , and the microwave absorption @xcite .",
    "the low lying spectra of quasiparticles and hole excitations are equidistant , @xmath43 where the angular momentum @xmath44 takes on half integer values .",
    "the `` minigap '' in the low @xmath0 @xmath42-wave superfluids is of order of @xmath45 . since the fermi energy @xmath46  it is equivalent in the clean limit to large values of dimensionless parameter @xmath47 .",
    "roughly there are andreev bound states below the superconducting threshold .",
    "free vortices in the chiral @xmath48-wave superconductors exhibit a remarkable topological feature of appearance of the zero energy mode in the vortex core @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of the low energy excitations remains equidistant , @xmath49 , but now @xmath44 is integer@xcite .",
    "the zero mode represents a condensed matter analog of the majorana fermion first noticed in elementary particle physics wilczek . while the minigap in the @xmath42 and @xmath50-wave superconductors was detected by stm , in @xmath48-wave",
    "has not yet been observed .",
    "the major reason for that is the _ small _ _ value of the _ _ _ minigap__@xmath51 in the core spectrum ( just @xmath52 for @xmath17 ) .",
    "it was shown theoretically @xcite that in the @xmath42-wave superconductors pinning by an inclusion of radius of just @xmath53 changes dramatically the subgap excitation spectrum : the minigap @xmath45 becomes of the order of @xmath2 .",
    "on the other hand in the chiral p - wave superconductors the spectrum of the core excitations of the charged states for @xmath54 is less sensitive to the inclusion , but nevertheless pushes the spectrum up towards @xmath2 , so that they therefore interfere less with the majorana state that is topologically protected and can not be affected by the inclusion @xcite .    in a magnetic field",
    "the nodal  @xmath25 superconductor under the same `` low @xmath0 '' assumption @xmath55 that allows the semiclassical approximation of the spectrum of andreev states of a singly vortex was calculated by kopnin@xcite .",
    "he found the spectrum to be similar to that of the s - wave superconductor despite the nodes .",
    "maki maki1 extended the work beyond the semiclassical approximation and found that there is a series of additional extended states along the node directions .",
    "the low - energy states have no counterpart in a vortex of @xmath42-wave superconductors .    as was pointed out later by maki and coworkers @xcite that in high @xmath56",
    "cuprates the parameter @xmath57 is of order @xmath58 and this modifies significantly the spectrum .",
    "it contains just a few andreev states in addition to the node extended states .",
    "the situation is expected to be different in d - wave gapped superconductors with @xmath59 discussed above and therefore the nodal states should disappear , while the number of andreev states should be small and could not be treated semiclassically .",
    "in fact the system of bogoliubov degennes equations for d - wave superconductors does not separate into a set of equations for each angular momentum @xmath44 unlike that of the s - wave and chiral p - wave .",
    "therefore beyond the semiclassical approximation all the angular momenta mix and one is forced@xcite to truncate the series .",
    "we found that the situation is different for chiral d - wave case : the system does separates into groups of two harmonics making its solution possible . for a gapped non - chiral superconductor",
    "one can develop the perturbation theory around the chiral limit .",
    "we perform this calculation for large @xmath57 and extend the work to 3d anisotropic superconductors not considered in @xcite .",
    "we compute the density of states and thermal conductivity along the field direction ( the vortex axis ) that can be effectively used  along with stm @xcite and microwave radiation to detect the features of the pairing .",
    "we begin with the nonlocal bdg equations for the bogoliubov eigenfunction corresponding to the eigenenergy @xmath60,@xmath61as a single particle hamiltonian one can take the parabolic dispersion and the approximation @xmath62where @xmath63 is the fermi energy .",
    "the gap function in an unconventional superconductor@xcite is characterized by the nonlocal `` order parameter '' operator , @xmath64within the bcs theory the kernel @xmath65 is subject to the self - consistency condition :    @xmath66 \\tanh \\left ( -\\frac{e_{n}}{2t}\\right ) \\text { , }   \\label{self}\\ ] ]    where @xmath67 is the pairing interaction and @xmath68 will be set to @xmath58 .    the vector potential @xmath69 for a single vortex has , in polar coordinates , @xmath70 , only an azimuthal component @xmath71 and in the london gauge consists of the singular part @xmath72 ( field of the infinitely thin solenoid ) and typically a rather insignificant regular part that does not carry flux . neglecting the regular part@xcite , the singular one",
    "can be `` compensated '' by the transformation @xcite:@xmath73after this transformation the hamiltonian @xmath74 has the form    @xmath75    introducing the center - of - mass coordinate , @xmath76 one makes a partial fourier representation @xmath77expanding @xmath78 to second order in @xmath79 ,    @xmath80    and substituting it into eq.([gap ] ) , one obtains , after integration by parts , a local form @xcite of the order parameter operator :    @xmath81    here the same operators are written via derivatives on the mesoscopic scale : @xmath82@xmath83for @xmath84 .",
    "thus the spatial part of the order parameter @xmath85 is normalized by the `` isotropic '' gap parameter @xmath86 .",
    "we assume for simplicity that the spatial dependence of the two components is the same @xmath87 .",
    "the anti - commutator was defined as @xmath88      let us introduce the following `` chiral '' operators , @xmath89where @xmath90 , and@xmath91 in terms of these operators one can write    @xmath92    @xmath93    @xmath94    substituting eqs . [ lplus],[lminus ] and eq .",
    "[ lxy ] into eqs.h0,[deltag ] , one obtains in this representation :    @xmath95    @xmath96      in polar coordinates ,    @xmath97    the chiral combinations are    @xmath98    the diagonal part of the bdg hamiltonian takes the form    @xmath99    the off diagonal terms in eqs.[transf ] include :    @xmath100    where    @xmath101    @xmath102",
    "let us consider the chiral case of @xmath103 in eq.([deltag ] ) .",
    "the set of bdg equation in this case is@xmath104using the translation symmetry in the field direction , the operator @xmath74 for component with momentum @xmath105 takes the form    @xmath106    where @xmath107 . despite the fact that there is no explicit rotational symmetry ,",
    "it is convenient to use the 2d angular momentum basis@xmath108which leads to    @xmath109    with the transition to energies in units of @xmath86 , in particular @xmath110 and distances in units of coherence length ( @xmath111 in the clean limit ) , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , the equations become:@xmath115where only two dimensionless parameters enter .",
    "one is @xmath116 and the second is @xmath117one observes that the equations decouple if one chooses in the second equation angular momentum @xmath118 :    @xmath119    the profile of the order parameter @xmath120 should be calculated self consistently , however we used a simple dependence @xmath121 .",
    "this is justified a posteriori by the local density of states ( ldos ) that shows that it is completely dominated by the continuum states rather than the few andreev states .",
    "this was solved numerically with boundary conditions @xmath122 and @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is the radius of the cylindrical sample ( disc when the width of the sample is finite @xmath125 ) .",
    "pinned vortices are discussed in the next section . the andreev bound state is found for small @xmath126 only for @xmath127 .",
    "the energy as function of @xmath105 for @xmath128 is presented in fig.1 .",
    "all the other angular momentum channels have just the continuum above the superconducting threshold .",
    "moreover it appears only for @xmath129since @xmath130 should be positive .",
    "this is a direct consequence of small @xmath57 . for large @xmath57",
    "the spectrum of andreev states is semiclassical as discussed in the introduction .",
    "the `` minigap '' therefore is very large and it is difficult to excite the core states .",
    "the andreev states ( one for each available value of @xmath105 ) are localized near the core , see the radial density @xmath131 in fig.2 .",
    "it extends several coherence lengths inside the superconductor    the core states come mostly from the particle rather than the hole sector for the given direction of the magnetic field , so there is a sizable charge density in the hole .",
    "the contributions from the continuum above the threshold are expected to compensate each other since they originate both from electron and hole excitations .",
    "the density of states reads : @xmath132      generally the @xmath50 - wave order parameter , eq.([dg ] ) , deviates from `` perfect chirality '' , @xmath3 , small deviations from the positive chirality can be parametrized by @xmath133 , @xmath134 :    @xmath135    the correction therefore can be written using eq.([lxy ] ) as@xmath136the shift of the andreev eigenstates energy occurs only in second order in @xmath137 since@xmath138the andreev state goes lower therefore only when the energy gap @xmath139 is significantly ( first order in @xmath137 ) smaller than @xmath86 .",
    "we expect that for yet lower @xmath140 the spectrum at small @xmath57 will still consist of just one andreev state in the @xmath127 channel .    till now the boundary condition at the center of the vortex was free .",
    "one can describe a pinned vortex by a different boundary condition , @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is the radius of the pinning area of order @xmath143 ( assumed for simplicity dielectric ) .",
    "the results do not change appreciably until the radius exceeds @xmath143 .",
    "thermal conductivity is an effective tool to demonstrate the minigap due to activated behavior of the electron contribution .",
    "to calculate the quasiparticle contribution to thermal conductivity along the vortex cores when the upper side of the vortex line is held at temperature @xmath144 and the lower side at temperature @xmath145 , we use a general ballistic ( width of the film @xmath146 smaller than the mean free path ) kopnin - landauer formula@xcite .",
    "the heat current at temperature lower than the threshold to the continuum of states is carried mainly by the bound core states . for a single vortex in a sufficiently thick sample",
    "the variable @xmath105 can be considered as a continuous one and the thermal current can be written as    @xmath147    where @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "changing variables one obtains @xmath150 .",
    "\\label{i(t)_final}\\]]here the lower limit of integration is the energy for @xmath151 and the indefinite integral is @xmath152where @xmath153 is the polylog function . for small temperature differences",
    "the linear response can be used ,    @xmath154 \\text{. }   \\label{minigapth}\\ ] ]       in fig.3 the heat conductance of a single vortex line is given as function of the inverse temperature ( in units of @xmath155 ) demonstrating the activated behaviour of the electron contribution .",
    "to summarize , in the gapped @xmath1 unconventional ( in the sense of @xmath63 being of the same order of magnitude as @xmath2 ) superconductor in a magnetic field the spectrum consists of a single excitation mode for any value of momentum @xmath105 along the field per abrikosov vortex .",
    "therefore each vortex core can be viewed as a nano - size normal `` quantum wire '' inside the superconducting material .",
    "the dispersion in this one - dimensional metallic system is roughly linear as a function of @xmath156 , see fig.1 . unlike the extended andreev states found in a better studied theoretically case of  the nodal @xmath25 case@xcite , the core states are well localized , see fig.2 .     due to the exceptionally large `` minigap '' it is difficult to excite the 1d quantum wire mechanically , thermally or electromagnetically .",
    "this has a large impact on the thermal transport along the field direction and vortex dynamics in the direction perpendicular to the field . at temperatures",
    "lower that @xmath157 the viscosity should be very large , while the thermal transport has an activated nature see fig .",
    "in particular case the critical current in such superconductors would be greatly enhanced at these temperatures .",
    "a magnetic field @xmath158 creates @xmath159 vortices over area @xmath160 , so that heat conductivity is @xmath161 , where @xmath146 is the sample width . for @xmath162 ( between @xmath163 and @xmath164 for cuprates ) , with @xmath165 at @xmath166 one obtains a thermal conductivity of order @xmath167 .    technically , since the coherence length is short and the fermi energy is relatively small , the quasiclassical approach is inapplicable and more complicated bogoliubov - degennes equations were used .",
    "the approach simplifies for the chiral @xmath50-wave superconductor , @xmath168 due to the decoupling of sectors in the bdg equation with different angular momentum @xmath44 .",
    "despite the fact that the angular momentum is not a conserved quantum number , it can be used to label andreev bound states .",
    "it turns out that such states exist only in the @xmath127 channel .",
    "the approach can be generalized for any superconductor of that type with a sufficiently large gap .",
    "a natural and rather direct method to look for evidence for chiral d - wave superconductors is microwave absorption by the vortex core states in a magnetic field . in this case",
    "the absorption depends strongly on the polarization of the incident wave @xcite .",
    "vortices are typically organized in the hexagonal vortex lattice that leads to the creation of a narrow band due to small overlaps of the andreev states belonging to the neighbouring vortex cores .",
    "periodicity however is not expected to play a role in thermal conductivity along the `` nanowires '' that are well separated .",
