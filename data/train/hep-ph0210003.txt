    "the tau  charm factory , a high  luminosity ( @xmath2 ) @xmath3 collider with a centre  of  mass energy near the @xmath4 production threshold , has been proposed as a powerful tool to perform high  precision studies of the @xmath5 lepton , charm hadrons and the charmonium system @xcite . in recent years",
    ", this energy region has been only partially explored by the chinese bebc machine ( @xmath6 ) . the possibility to operate",
    "the cornell cesr collider around the @xmath4 threshold has revived again the interest on tau  charm factory physics .",
    "a precise understanding of the @xmath7 production cross section near threshold is clearly required .",
    "the accurate experimental analysis of this observable could allow to improve the present measurement @xcite of the @xmath5 lepton mass .",
    "the cross section @xmath0 has already been analysed to @xmath8 in refs .",
    "@xcite , including a resummation of the leading coulomb corrections .",
    "the recent development of non - relativistic effective field theories of qed ( nrqed ) and qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite has allowed an extensive investigation of the threshold production of heavy flavours at @xmath3 colliders .",
    "the threshold @xmath9 @xcite and @xmath10 @xcite production cross sections have been computed to the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in a combined expansion in powers of @xmath1 and the fermion velocities . making appropriate changes , those calculations can be easily applied to the study of @xmath4 production @xcite .",
    "one can then achieve a theoretical precision better than 0.1% .",
    "at lowest order in qed , the @xmath5 leptons are produced by one - photon exchange in the s - channel , and the total cross section formula reads @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the velocity of the final @xmath5 leptons in the center - of - mass frame of the @xmath14 pair which makes @xmath15 vanish when @xmath16 .",
    "electromagnetic corrections of @xmath17 arise from the interference between the tree level result and 1-loop amplitudes .",
    "a factor @xmath18 emerges in the 1-loop final state interaction between the tau leptons , making the cross section at threshold finite .",
    "furry s theorem guarantees that contributions to @xmath19 coming from initial , intermediate and final state corrections completely factorize at @xmath8 , including real photon emission .",
    "some undesirable features appear at @xmath20 : the two - loop @xmath21 vertex develops an @xmath22 term which makes the cross section ill - defined when @xmath23 , and multiple photon production of tau leptons by box - type diagrams and the non - zero interference of initial and final state radition spoil exact factorization .",
    "however , as it has been recently shown @xcite , the squared amplitude of the @xmath24 box diagram is proportional to @xmath25 , and so represents a n@xmath26lo correction in the combined expansion in powers of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , far beyond the scope of this analysis .",
    "in addition , contributions to the total cross section from diagrams with real photons emitted from the produced taus can be shown to begin at n@xmath29lo , and factorization remains at nnlo .",
    "the total cross section can thus be written as an integration over the product of separate pieces including initial , intermediate and final state corrections : @xmath30 the radiation function @xmath31 @xcite describes initial state radiation , including virtual corrections .",
    "the integration accounts for the effective energy loss due to photon emission from the @xmath14 pair , and it includes the largest corrections coming from the emission of an arbitrary number of initial photons , which can sizeably suppress the total cross section .",
    "@xmath32 collects only final - state interactions between the tau leptons , and it is usually written in terms of the tau spectral density @xmath33 , @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "the threshold behaviour of the total cross section will be ruled by the expansion of @xmath33 at low velocities .",
    "a nnlo calculation of the cross section in the kinematic region where @xmath36 has to account for all terms proportional to @xmath37 $ ] with @xmath38 the leading divergences ( i.e. @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) are resummed in the well - known sommerfeld factor @xcite @xmath41 multiplying the born cross section  ( [ s0 ] ) . a systematic way to calculate higher - order corrections in this regime requires the use of a simplified theory which keeps the relevant physics at the scale @xmath42 , characteristic of the coulomb interaction .",
    "nrqed @xcite was designed precisely for this purpose .",
    "it is an effective field theory of qed at low energies , applicable to fermions in non - relativistic regimes , i.e. with typical momenta @xmath43 .",
    "interactions contained in the nrqed lagrangian have a definite velocity counting but propagators and loop integrations can also generate powers of @xmath28 . with appropriate counting rules at hand , one can prove that all interactions between the non - relativistic pair @xmath4 can be described up to nnlo in terms of time - independent potentials @xcite , derived from the low - energy lagrangian .",
    "therefore , the low - energy expression of the @xmath5 spectral density is related with the non - relativistic green s functions @xcite : @xmath44 with @xmath45 a short distance coefficient to be determined by matching full and effective theory results and @xmath46 the non - relativistic energy .",
    "the details of this derivation can be found in the appendix b of @xcite .",
    "the green s function @xmath47 obeys the schrdinger equation corresponding to a two - body system interacting through potentials derived from @xmath48 at nnlo : @xmath49 the term @xmath50 is the first relativistic correction to the kinetic energy .",
    "@xmath51 stands for the coulomb potential with @xmath52 corrections . at nnlo ,",
    "the heavy leptons are only produced in triplet s - wave states , so we just need to consider the corresponding projection of the breit - fermi potential @xmath53 .",
    "finally , @xmath54 is a nnlo piece derived from a contact term in @xmath48 , which reproduces the qed tree level s - channel diagram for the process @xmath55 .",
    "a solution of eq .  ( [ schrodingerfull ] ) must rely on numerical or perturbative techniques . in the qed case , a significant difference between both approaches",
    "is not expected , being @xmath27 such a small parameter .",
    "consequently we follow the perturbative approach , using recent results @xcite , where nlo and nnlo corrections to the green s function are calculated analytically , via rayleigh - schrdinger time - independent perturbation theory around the known lo coulomb green s function @xmath56 .",
    "we refer the reader to appendix c of @xcite for complete expressions of the green s function corrections .",
    "for a complete nnlo description of @xmath57 , two - loop corrections to the photon propagator should be included .",
    "the light lepton contributions to the vacuum polarization are the standard 1- and 2-loop perturbative expressions . for the @xmath5 contribution in the threshold vicinity @xmath58 , resummation of singular terms in the limit",
    "@xmath16 is again mandatory . under the assumption @xmath59",
    ", we need to know nlo contributions to @xmath60 , performing the direct matching for both real and imaginary parts .    in the hadronic sector",
    ", we can relate the hadronic vacuum polarization with the total cross section @xmath61 .",
    "below 1  gev , the electromagnetic production of hadrons is dominated by the @xmath62 resonance and its decay to two charged pions .",
    "the photon mediated @xmath63 production cross section is driven by the pion electromagnetic form factor @xmath64 . an analytic expression for @xmath64",
    "was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , using resonance chiral theory and the restrictions imposed by analyticity and unitarity .",
    "the obtained @xmath64 provides an excellent description of experimental data up to energies of the order @xmath65 1  gev@xmath66 .    for the integration region above @xmath67 , we use @xmath68 as calculated from pqcd . our simple estimate has been proved @xcite to deviate by less than 5@xmath69 for the running of @xmath27 at the scale @xmath70 . considering that @xmath71 modifies @xmath19 near threshold by roughly @xmath72 ,",
    "our result has a global uncertainty smaller than @xmath73 for the total cross section .",
    "green s functions develop energy poles below threshold corresponding to spin triplet ( n@xmath74 ) electromagnetic @xmath4 bound states .",
    "the small width of these bound levels , dominated by their @xmath3 decay rate @xmath75 make these states very difficult to be resolved experimentally .",
    "for the same reason , the bound states can not affect the shape of the cross section at threshold , contrary to the case of heavy quark threshold production , where bound states play a crucial role .",
    "the spectral density @xmath76 at low velocities in both qed and nrqed.,scaledwidth=50.0%,height=207 ]    the need for performing resummations of the leading non - relativistic terms @xmath77 $ ] is evidenced in fig .  [",
    "fig : rthreshold ] .",
    "the qed spectral density vanishes as @xmath78 , due to the phase space velocity in formula ( [ s0 ] ) , which is cancelled by the first @xmath79 term appearing in the @xmath80 correction , making the cross section at threshold finite .",
    "more singular terms near threshold , @xmath81 arising in higher - order corrections completely spoil the expected good convergence of the qed perturbative series at low @xmath28 .",
    "this is no longer the case for the effective theory perturbative series , whose convergence improves as we approach the threshold point , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rsizes ] , and higher - order corrections reduce the perturbative uncertainty . in the whole energy range displayed in fig .  [",
    "fig : rsizes ] , the differences between the nnlo , nlo and lo results are below 0.8% , which indicates that the lo result , i.e. the sommerfeld factor , contains the relevant physics to describe the threshold region .      adding the intermediate and initial state corrections we have a complete description of the total cross section of @xmath4 production , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kirk ] . coulomb interaction between the produced @xmath5 s , becomes essential within few mev s above the threshold , and its effects have to be taken into account to all orders .",
    "initial state radiation effectively reduces the available center - of - mass energy for @xmath5 production , lowering in this way the total cross section .",
    "we should emphasize that nnlo corrections do not modify the predicted behaviour of the lo and nlo cross section , but are essential to guarantee that the truncated perturbative series at nlo gets small corrections from higher - order terms .",
    "hence , we have shown that the theoretical uncertainty of our analysis of @xmath57 is lower than 0.1% . nevertheless , the statistical uncertainty of the most recent experiments is still much larger than the theoretical one due to low statistics , and we should wait for future machines to improve it .    *",
