    "whilst there are over 1000 extrasolar planets now known , much of our understanding of these objects rests on those which transit their parent star . for these exoplanets",
    "only is it possible to measure their radius and true mass , allowing the determination of their surface gravity and density , and thus inference of their internal structure and formation processes .",
    "a total of 1137 transiting extrasolar planets ( teps ) are now known , but only a small fraction of these have high - precision measurements of their physical properties .",
    "of these 1150 planets , 58 have mass and radius measurements to 5% precision , and only eight to 3% precision .",
    "the two main limitations to the high - fidelity measurements of the masses and radii of teps are the precision of spectroscopic radial velocity measurements ( mainly affecting objects discovered using the corot and _ kepler _ satellites ) and the quality of the transit light curves ( for objects discovered via ground - based facilities ) .",
    "whilst the former problem is intractable with current instrumentation , the latter problem can be solved by obtaining high - precision transit light curves of tep systems which are bright enough for high - precision spectroscopic observations to be available .",
    "we are therefore undertaking a project to characterise bright teps visible from the southern hemisphere , using the 1.54 m danish telescope in defocussed mode . in this work we present transit light curves of three targets discovered by the superwasp project @xcite . from these , and published spectroscopic analyses , we measure their physical properties and orbital ephemerides to high precision .",
    "this planetary system was discovered by @xcite and consists of a jupiter - like planet ( mass 1.2@xmath0  and radius 1.3@xmath1 ) on a circular orbit around a late - f star ( mass 1.2@xmath2  and radius 1.3@xmath3 ) every 2.34d .",
    "the comparatively short orbital period and hot host star means wasp-24b has a high equilibrium temperature of 1800k .",
    "@xcite obtained photometry of eight transits , of which three were fully observed , from the liverpool , faulkes north and faulkes south telescopes ( lt , ftn and fts ) . the nearest star to wasp-24 ( 21.2@xmath4 ) was found to be an eclipsing binary system with 0.8mag deep eclipses on a possible period of 1.156d .",
    "@xcite obtained high - precision radial velocities ( rvs ) of one transit using the harps spectrograph . from modelling of the rossiter - mclauglin ( rm )",
    "effect @xcite they found a projected spin - orbit alignment angle @xmath5 .",
    "this is consistent with wasp-24b having zero orbital obliquity .",
    "@xcite presented observations of two occultations ( at 3.6@xmath6 m and 4.5@xmath6 m ) with the _ spitzer _ space telescope .",
    "these data were used to constrain the orbital eccentricity to be @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , but were not sufficient to determine whether wasp-24b possesses an atmospheric inversion layer . @xcite",
    "also observed one transit in the strmgren @xmath9 and @xmath10 passbands with the busca multi - band imager ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and provided new measurements of the physical properties of the system .",
    "@xcite studied the orbital motion of wasp-24 over 3.5 years using high - precision rvs from multiple telescopes .",
    "they found no evidence for orbital eccentricity or for a long - term drift attributable to a third body in the system .",
    "finally , @xcite obtained one transit light curve of wasp-24 , and spectral analyses of the host star have been performed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "wasp-25 @xcite is a comparatively unstudied system containing a low - density transiting planet ( mass 0.6@xmath0 , radius 1.2@xmath1 ) orbiting a solar - like star ( mass 1.1@xmath2 , radius 0.9@xmath3 ) every 3.76d .",
    "their follow - up observations included two transits , one observed with fts and one with the euler telescope .",
    "@xcite observed one transit with harps , detecting the rm effect and finding @xmath11 .",
    "they deduced that this is consistent with an aligned orbit , using the bayesian information criterion .",
    "@xcite measured the effective temperature ( @xmath12 ) of wasp-25a using the infrared flux method .",
    "@xcite obtained the spectral parameters of the star from high - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "wasp-26 was discovered by @xcite and contains a typical hot jupiter ( mass 1.0@xmath0 , radius 1.2@xmath1 ) orbiting a g0v star ( mass 1.1@xmath2 , radius 1.3@xmath3 ) in a circular 2.75d orbit .",
    "wasp-26 has a common - proper - motion companion at 15@xmath4  which is roughly 2.5mag fainter than the planet host star .",
    "@xcite observed one transit of wasp-26 with fts and one with a large scatter with ftn .",
    "@xcite obtained high - precision rvs using harps through one transit of wasp-26 , but their data were insufficient to allow detection of the rm effect .",
    "they also observed a transit with a 35 cm telescope ; the data are too scattered to be useful for the current work .",
    "@xcite observed a spectroscopic transit using keck / hires and made a low - confidence detection of the rm effect resulting in @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite observed two occultations , at 3.6@xmath6 m and 4.5@xmath6 m , using _",
    "spitzer_. they were unable to distinguish whether the planet has an atmosphere with or without a thermal inversion , but could conclude that the orbit was likely circular with @xmath14 at @xmath8 confidence . @xcite also presented light curves of a transit taken in the @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 filters , using busca .",

    "the orbital period can not be determined from these data , but is likely quite short as the eclipses do not last long .",
    "the superwasp survey @xcite has obtained 5800 observations of this object , but these show no obvious variability due to the faintness of the object and the shallowness of the eclipses . whilst it would be a useful probe of the properties of stars on the lower main sequence , 2massj00182645@xmath251511492 is not a particularly promising object for further study due to its shallow eclipses , which makes the measurement of precise photometric parameters difficult , and unknown orbital period .",
