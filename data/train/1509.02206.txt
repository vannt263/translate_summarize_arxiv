    "the effects of strong magnetic anisotropy , traditionally investigated in magnetic insulators , especially , in @xmath3-electron systems @xcite , recently attracted renewed interest in connection with molecular magnetic materials @xcite .",
    "the investigation of molecular nanomagnets gave birth to new objects such as single - molecule magnets ( smms ) @xcite and single - chain magnets @xcite , and initiated studies in the domain of molecular spintronics @xcite and quantum computation @xcite . among them , in the last years the accent moved towards lanthanide complexes which have already demonstrated several exciting properties @xcite .",
    "the key feature of lanthanide ions in materials is their strong magnetic anisotropy caused by strong spin - orbit coupling effects @xcite , which often leads to highly axial ground and low - lying excited doublet states even in the lack of axial symmetry @xcite . due to small radius of electronic @xmath3-shells ,",
    "the exchange interaction in lanthanide complexes is much weaker than the crystal - field splitting on lanthanide ions @xcite . as a result , only individual doublet states on lanthanide sites , described by pseudospins @xmath4 , participate in the magnetic interaction .",
    "the latter is described by a hamiltonian bilinear in pseudospins ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) in the case of two interacting lanthanide ions , or a pseudospin ( @xmath5 ) and a true spin ( @xmath7 ) in the case of a lanthanide ion interacting with a transition metal or a radical when the spin - orbit coupling in the second site is negligible . for strongly axial doublet states on the lanthanide sites ( ln )",
    "these hamiltonians basically become of ising type @xcite : @xmath8 either collinear ( @xmath9 ) or non - collinear ( @xmath10 ) depending on geometry @xcite and details of interaction .",
    "@xcite the exchange parameter is contributed by magnetic dipolar and exchange interaction between the sites , @xmath11 , the former being usually stronger in net lanthanide complexes @xcite .",
    "this paradigm was recently challenged by a series of n@xmath1-radical bridged dilanthanide complexes [ k(18-crown-6)]\\{[(me@xmath12si)@xmath13n](thf)ln}@xmath13(@xmath14-@xmath15:@xmath15-n@xmath13 ) ( ln = gd ( * 1 * ) , tb ( * 2 * ) , dy ( * 3 * ) , ho ( * 4 * ) , er ( * 5 * ) , thf = tetrahydrofuran ) , shown in fig . [ fig1]a @xcite . in some of these compounds",
    "the exchange interaction was found to be two orders of magnitude stronger than in any known lanthanide system .",
    "this is of the same order of magnitude as the crystal - field splitting of @xmath16-multiplets on the lanthanide sites , implying that the picture of exchange interaction involving individual crystal - field doublets , eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_ising ] ) , is no longer valid for these compounds .",
    "moreover , the terbium complex from this series exhibits a magnetic hysteresis at 14 k and a 100 s blocking time at 13.9 k ( one of the highest blocking temperatures among existing smms @xcite ) , suggesting a possible implication of the giant exchange interaction in this smm behavior .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to reveal the mechanism of giant exchange interaction and the origin of the magnetization blocking of the series of the complexes based on adequate theoretical treatment .",
    "we apply an approach combining _ ab initio _ and density - functional theory ( dft ) calculations with microscopic model description to unravel the nature of this exchange interaction .",
    "we also elucidate the origin of blocking barriers in these compounds and discuss the effect of strength of exchange interaction on magnetization blocking in strongly anisotropic complexes .",
    "to understand the origin of such strong exchange interaction , we consider the simplest complex of the series , the gadolinium one . in this system",
    "the isotropic spins of gd@xmath0 ions ( @xmath17 ) interact with the radical spin of the n@xmath1 bridge ( @xmath18 ) via heisenberg exchange interaction , @xmath19 , described by a single parameter @xmath20 due to the inversion symmetry of the complex ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) .",
    "broken - symmetry dft calculations @xcite give the value @xmath21 @xmath22 in close agreement with the experimental one ,",
    "@xmath23 @xmath22 @xcite , and the previous dft calculations @xcite .    to get insight into the mechanism responsible for the obtained huge value of @xmath20 , we projected a series of dft calculations into the effective tight - binding and hubbard models acting in the space of interacting magnetic orbitals of two gd ions and the radical ( see the supplemental material for details ) . because of the @xmath24 symmetry of the exchange core ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) , the antibonding @xmath25 orbital accommodating the unpaired electron of n@xmath1 radical overlaps with only one of the @xmath26 orbitals on each ln site , the @xmath27 one ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ) .",
    "the corresponding transfer parameter @xmath28 was derived for the gd complex as @xmath29 1407 @xmath22 .",
    "the value of @xmath28 is obtained large because the radical s magnetic orbital @xmath25 resides on nearest - neighbor atoms ( nitrogens ) to both lanthanides .",
    "most important , this orbital is found to lie higher than the @xmath30 orbitals by as much as @xmath31 @xmath22 ( fig . [ fig2]b ) .",
    "because of this huge energy gap , small electron promotion energy is expected for the electron transfer from the @xmath25 to the @xmath30 orbitals : the coulomb repulsion energy between the transferred electron and the @xmath3 electrons is cancelled at large extent by @xmath32 . on the other hand , because of the same large gap @xmath32 , the promotion energy of electron transfer from @xmath26 to @xmath25 orbital is at least one order of magnitude larger .",
    "therefore , the contribution of this process to the exchange coupling can be neglected .",
    "indeed , our analysis using the hubbard model gives the experimental @xmath20 for the gd complex with ( averaged ) promotion energy of @xmath33 @xmath22 , a value many times smaller than typical `` hubbard @xmath34 '' in metal complexes @xcite .",
    "taking into account only the dominant virtual electron transfer , @xmath35 , the kinetic contribution to the gd@xmath0-n@xmath1 exchange parameter is written in a good approximation as @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "compared to this mechanism , the other contributions such as the direct exchange , the delocalization of unpaired electron of n@xmath1 into the empty @xmath37 orbitals of gd@xmath0 ( goodenough s mechanism @xcite ) , the spin polarization and the magnetic dipolar interaction between gd@xmath0 ions are expected to be 1 - 2 orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "the reason is that all these contributions are expected to be of the same order of magnitude as in other lanthanide - radical compounds .",
    "indeed , the direct exchange integral depends only on the shape of the @xmath26 an radical s orbitals , which is not expected to be much different from other complexes .",
    "the goodenough s contribution arises from higher ( third ) order of the perturbation theory compared to the usual kinetic exchange , and involves the excitation energy into a higher @xmath37 orbital on the ln site . both these contributions",
    "are usually neglected unless the conventional kinetic exchange appears to be small @xcite .",
    "the spin polarization mechanism starts to play a role when the ligand bridging the magnetic centers contains a spectrum of low - lying orbital excitations , which is certainly not the case of n@xmath1 . as for magnetic dipolar interaction ,",
    "it is estimated for gd@xmath0-n@xmath1 to be @xmath38 0.25 @xmath22 .",
    "the same physical situation is realized in the other complexes of the series . as table [ tablei ] shows",
    ", the transfer parameters only slightly decrease with the increase of ln atomic number . on the other hand ,",
    "the gap @xmath32 between the @xmath26 and the @xmath25 orbital levels is obtained as huge as in the gd complex ( table [ tablei ] ) , leading again to small promotion energy and , consequently , to the dominant role of the kinetic mechanism in the ln@xmath0-n@xmath1 exchange coupling of complexes * 2 * -*5*. given the small change of @xmath28 through * 1 * -*5 * , the strong variation of the strength of exchange interaction in this series of complexes , testified by the experimental magnetic susceptibilities ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) , is expected to be due to the variation of the promotion energy .",
    "contrary to the gd complex , the other members of the series are characterized by strong magnetic anisotropy on the ln sites induced by the crystal - field ( cf ) splitting of their atomic @xmath16 multiplets .",
    "these cf - split multiplets are described by multi - configurational wave - functions , therefore , they should be treated by explicitly correlated _ ab initio _ approaches @xcite rather than dft .",
    "the _ ab initio _ fragment calculations show that the cf split @xmath16 multiplet on tb@xmath0 ion ( @xmath39 @xmath22 ) is of the same order of magnitude as the estimated isotropic exchange splitting in * 1 * ( @xmath40 @xmath22 ) .",
    "therefore , in sharp contrast with the common situation in lanthanides , the exchange coupling in the anisotropic * 2 * -*5 * does not reduce to the interaction between individual ( lowest ) cf doublets on ln sites with the @xmath41 spin of the radical , eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_ising ] ) , but will intermix the entire cf spectrum arising from the ground atomic @xmath16 multiplet at lanthanide ions . then",
    ", such exchange interaction should be formulated in terms of the total angular momenta @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) on the lanthanide sites .        extending the anderson s superexchange theory @xcite to strong spin - orbit coupled systems ,",
    "the tensorial form of the kinetic ( covalent ) interaction has been recently derived from the microscopic electronic hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the kinetic interaction between the lanthanide and radical centers contains besides the exchange part ( @xmath44 ) also the ln@xmath0-n@xmath1 covalent contribution ( arising from ln@xmath0-n@xmath1 electron delocalization ) to the cf splitting at the ln@xmath0 sites ( @xmath45 ) : @xmath46 here , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the unit and the spin operators , respectively , of the radical s spin @xmath49 , @xmath50 are the stevens operators @xcite of rank @xmath51 and component @xmath52 , and @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the exchange parameters @xcite .",
    "the stevens operator @xmath50 is a polynomial of @xmath55 @xmath56 of @xmath51th degree , in which @xmath57 @xmath58 corresponds to the order of @xmath59 @xmath60 .",
    "the maximal rank of @xmath51 is 7 for the considered ln@xmath0 ions , whereas the maximal @xmath57 is 5 in the present case because only the @xmath30 magnetic orbitals at the lanthanide sites contribute to the kinetic exchange .",
    "the summation over @xmath51 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hcov ] ) and ( [ eq : hex ] ) is confined to even and odd ranks , respectively , which is required by the invariance of these hamiltonians with respect to time - inversion . as it is seen from the form of these hamiltonians , @xmath45 only contributes to the cf splitting of @xmath16 multiplets on individual metal sites , whereas @xmath44 describes the interaction between powers of total angular momenta at the metal sites with components of spin @xmath41 of the n@xmath1 radical . for comparison ,",
    "the weak anisotropic exchange interaction between two spins ( pseudospins ) is described by the exchange hamiltonian @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the @xmath63 exchange matrix , containing one isotropic , five symmetric anisotropic and three antisymmetric ( dzyaloshinsky - moriya ) exchange parameters @xcite .",
    "this hamiltonian corresponds to the first rank contribution ( @xmath64 ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hex ] ) , where @xmath65 are just the nine components of the above exchange matrix @xmath62 .",
    "the expression for the exchange parameter @xmath66 @xcite includes all virtual electron transfer processes , @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the number of @xmath26 electrons in ln@xmath0 . the multiplet electronic structure of ln@xmath69 is fully included in the electron promotion energy @xmath70 and the wave functions of the intermediate states , where by @xmath71 we further denote the smallest promotion energy , @xmath72 numbers the intermediate @xmath16-multiplets , and @xmath73 is the excitation energy of the multiplet @xmath72 with respect to the ground one in ln@xmath69 .",
    "the highly complex tensorial form of the exchange hamiltonian is inevitable for orbitally degenerate systems with strong spin - orbit coupling , as was pointed out long time ago @xcite .",
    "although all exchange parameters @xmath66 are in principle required for adequate description of the exchange interaction , it is hardly possible to extract a sufficient large number of them from experiment in a unique way .",
    "however , once @xmath66 are expressed via microscopic electronic parameters @xcite , the latter can be determined from up - to - date quantum chemistry calculations .",
    "thus the transfer parameter @xmath28 is obtained here from dft calculations , expected to be accurate enough @xcite , whereas the excitation energies @xmath73 and the cf states are obtained by fragment state - of - the - art _ ab initio _ calculations including spin - orbit coupling @xcite .",
    "the only parameter that might be inaccurate when extracted from dft or _",
    "ab initio _ calculations is @xmath71 .",
    "indeed , the former gives at most an averaged value over multiplets @xmath74 and the latter systematically overestimates it due to insufficient account of dynamical correlation .",
