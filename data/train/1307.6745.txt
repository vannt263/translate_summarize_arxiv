    "in recent years , there has been great interest in the investigation of the correlations that may arise from @xmath2-@xmath2 interactions in monolayer@xcite as well as in bilayer graphene@xcite . in these systems ,",
    "the coulomb repulsion between electrons constitutes the dominant interaction , placing the carbon material in a strong coupling regime as @xmath3 turns out to be nominally larger than the fermi velocity @xmath4 of the electrons@xcite .",
    "yet the effects of electron correlations have been quite elusive , apart from the observation of the fractional quantum hall effect in monolayer graphene@xcite and several signatures of exotic phases in bilayer graphene@xcite .",
    "the observation of superconductivity in a graphene system is a widely shared aspiration , and some proposals have been already put forward to induce a pairing instability in the carbon layer@xcite .",
    "several experimental studies have been carried out showing the feasibility of superconducting correlations and even supercurrents in graphene contacted with superconducting electrodes@xcite .",
    "however , it is still an intriguing question whether graphene may support superconducting correlations on its own under appropriate experimental conditions .    in that respect ,",
    "a suitable way of amplifying the electronic correlations may consist in tuning the fermi level at the points with divergent density of states ( so - called van hove singularities ) that are present in the spectrum of both monolayer graphene and twisted graphene bilayers .",
    "experimental measures of the electronic dispersion in graphene at large doping levels have shown indeed that the saddle points in the conduction band develop an extended shape that may significantly reinforce the modulation of the screened coulomb interaction@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , a van hove singularity has been already observed experimentally in the lowest - energy subband of the twisted bilayers@xcite , which makes them ideal systems to address the effects of the strong correlation with a minimum of electron doping .    in narrow - band electron systems ,",
    "magnetic and superconducting instabilities are in general likely to appear as a consequence of the enhanced density of states near the fermi level .",
    "the route towards superconductivity can be elaborated starting from ideas proposed long ago by w. kohn and j. m. luttinger , trying to understand if a pairing instability could arise out of a purely repulsive interaction@xcite .",
    "it happens that , in electron systems with anisotropic dispersion , the coulomb interaction can be screened with different intensity along the fermi surface , giving rise in some cases to a significant modulation of the effective interaction .",
    "then it becomes possible that , after making the decomposition into the different modes according to the symmetry group of the fermi surface , the couplings in some of the channels may turn out to be negative@xcite .",
    "this sign of attractive interaction is enough to trigger a superconducting instability , though the magnitude of the negative couplings may be in general so small that the critical scale for superconductivity becomes many orders of magnitude smaller than the fermi energy .",
    "however , in cases where the fermi surface is close to saddle points in the electronic dispersion , the modulation displayed by the screened @xmath2-@xmath2 interaction can be quite strong , as a result of the divergent density of states provided by the saddle points . in models with such a van hove singularity in the spectrum , the critical scale for",
    "the pairing instability may be a small fraction of the typical energy scale of the band structure , leading nevertheless to much higher transition temperatures than those obtained in conventional models with electron - phonon interactions . in the context of the high-@xmath5 cuprate superconductors",
    ", the proximity of the fermi level to a saddle point in the electronic dispersion@xcite has been invoked to account for several unconventional properties of the cuprates@xcite , including the @xmath6-wave order parameter of the superconducting condensate@xcite .",
    "many of these features enter also in correspondence with the properties expected from microscopic theories of the cuprates , based mainly on the hubbard model .    in the context of the honeycomb carbon lattice ,",
    "an investigation of the role of the van hove singularities to induce a superconducting instability has been carried out in ref .",
    "the analysis was made there under the assumption of a relatively small next - to - nearest neighbor hopping , still preserving an approximate nesting of the fermi line passing by the saddle points . under these conditions ,",
    "the electron scattering is more intense at the momentum connecting each two inequivalent saddle points , and the superconducting instability turns out to appear in the channel with @xmath6-wave symmetry .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached in the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite . anyhow ,",
    "that geometry of the fermi line does not seem to be applicable to the van hove singularity in the conduction band of graphene , where the extended character of the saddle points favors the scattering of electrons with vanishing momentum transfer .",
    "then , the development of the superconducting instability takes place in general in the @xmath0-wave channel@xcite .",
    "the same symmetry of the order parameter has been also obtained in numerical studies of the van hove singularity under the assumption of short - range coulomb interaction@xcite . in a different unrelated situation ,",
    "@xmath0-wave symmetry has been also predicted for a superconducting instability arising in graphene at low doping levels about the charge neutrality point@xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we will apply the kohn - luttinger mechanism of superconductivity to the case where there is an extended van hove singularity in the electronic spectrum , as it happens in the conduction band of graphene .",
    "we will provide a very general argument to show that the superconducting instability must have then @xmath0-wave symmetry . as the electron scattering is greatly enhanced by the extended character of the saddle points in the dispersion , the uniform magnetic susceptibility can also grow large in that situation .",
    "we will see however that the couplings measuring the effective attraction in the pairing channels are also amplified , formally diverging when the critical point for a ferromagnetic instability is approached .",
    "this explains that the pairing instability turns out to prevail over the tendency towards magnetic order in the presence of the extended van hove singularity .",
    "in the case of the twisted graphene bilayers , we will see instead that they are more prone to develop a magnetic instability as they approach the regime close to the formation of flat zero - energy subbands for decreasing twist angle@xcite .",
    "we will show that the low - energy van hove singularity arising from the hybridization of twisted dirac cones favors then a ferromagnetic instability in the system .",
    "this is reminiscent of the evidence of ferromagnetism found in monte carlo simulations of the hubbard model in the square lattice with next - to - nearest neighbor hopping , in the limit where the van hove singularity undergoes a similar collapse at the bottom of the band@xcite .",
    "as shown below , the many - body approaches used here to describe these instabilities can be also put in correspondence with renormalization group analyses of the interacting electron system , which have also shown that ferromagnetism is a likely instability when the fermi level is close to a van hove singularity , in the absence of significant nesting of the fermi surface@xcite .",
    "in a two - dimensional system , the van hove singularities in the density of states arise from the presence of saddle points in the electronic dispersion , as those shown in a typical plot for the graphene lattice in fig .",
    "[ disp ] . for small deviation @xmath7 of the momentum with respect to the center of each saddle point",
    ", the dispersion can be approximated by @xmath8    as a consequence of the flatness of the band around the saddle points , a number of susceptibilities diverge at the van hove singularity , with relative strengths that depend on the particular values of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 parameters .",
    "the particle - hole susceptibility @xmath11 at vanishing momentum transfer is given for instance by @xmath12 where @xmath13 measures the deviation of the fermi level with respect to the van hove singularity and @xmath14 is a high - energy cutoff .",
    "the particle - hole susceptibility at momentum - transfer @xmath15 connecting two inequivalent saddle points also diverges as @xmath16 with a prefactor given in the case of @xmath17 by @xmath18 the singularity in the expression ( [ pref ] ) reflects the instance of perfect nesting of the fermi line , which corresponds in the honeycomb lattice to @xmath19 or @xmath20 .",
    "finally , the particle - particle susceptibility @xmath21 at vanishing total momentum @xmath22 of the pair of electrons diverges as @xmath23    the large growth of the susceptibilities as @xmath24 leads to the divergence of several response functions as one approaches the van hove singularity .",
    "the strongest divergence among them dictates the character of the dominant electronic instability in the system . in this respect",
    ", there are two different scenarios , depending on the relative strength of the particle - hole susceptibilities at momentum - transfer @xmath25 and @xmath15 .",
    "when @xmath26 , the tendency towards a spin - density - wave instability at momentum @xmath15 prevails over a ferromagnetic instability . in that case",
    ", however , a superconducting instability may be also viable , due to the anisotropy created in the effective @xmath2-@xmath2 interaction by the large momentum - dependent screening near the van hove singularity .",
    "this is actually the possibility that was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . in those circumstances",
    ", it was shown that the dominant superconducting instability takes place in a @xmath6-wave channel , which corresponds to the degenerate representation @xmath27 ( @xmath28 integer , @xmath29 not a multiple of 3 ) of the point symmetry group @xmath30 .",
    "the other scenario corresponds to the case in which @xmath31 .",
    "a ferromagnetic instability may arise then in the system , as illustrated in the analysis of the square lattice by renormalization group methods near the van hove singularity@xcite and supported by monte carlo simulations@xcite . as mentioned before ,",
    "the case of largest strength of the particle - hole susceptibility @xmath32 is in general the relevant instance for graphene monolayer and bilayer systems .",
    "we will see in what follows that a superconducting instability is also possible in this case , but with an order parameter which has preferentially @xmath0-wave symmetry .",
    "an important point regarding the many - body theory of electrons near a van hove singularity is that all the momentum dependence of the interaction potential is irrelevant when scaling the theory towards the low - energy limit .",
    "this is the reflection of the intense screening from the divergent density of states , that reduces the effective interaction at low energies to a purely local component in real space .",
    "this can be seen from inspection of the effective action , written in terms of creation ( annihilation ) operators @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) for electrons with spin @xmath35 as @xmath36 with the fourier transform @xmath37 of the electron density given by @xmath38    thus , one can check that the action ( [ actk ] ) is invariant under the scale transformation @xmath39 provided one keeps only the zeroth order term in the expansion of @xmath40 in powers of the momentum .",
    "higher orders in the power series of the potential would be affected by powers of @xmath41 , with the result that they would be increasingly suppressed as @xmath42 .",
    "this is the limit in which the theory is scaled down to low energies , meaning that one can just remain with the constant term @xmath43 for the sake of studying the low - energy instabilities of the electron system near the van hove singularity .      focusing on the case where the largest electron - hole susceptibility is given by @xmath32",
    ", we can sum up in the framework of the rpa the most divergent contributions to the charge and spin response functions .",
    "these are given by correlators of the electron densities @xmath44 and @xmath45 , that we define now with more generality from electron creation ( annihilation ) operators @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) for a number of independent saddle points @xmath48 , @xmath49 the response functions for charge and spin are given respectively by @xmath50    in general , the @xmath2-@xmath2 interaction may be mediated by a potential @xmath51 between electrons with parallel spin and @xmath52 for electrons with opposite spin projections . in the rpa , the response functions @xmath53 and @xmath54 must obey the self - consistent equations represented diagrammatically in fig .",
    "we have then @xmath55 solving the linear system ( [ rpa])-([rpe ] ) , we find @xmath56    we can go back now to the charge and spin response functions , obtaining the result @xmath57 we find then the origin of the spin instability when @xmath58 .",
    "this is the natural situation when the screening effects are so strong that the @xmath2-@xmath2 interaction is reduced to a purely on - site repulsion . in the context of electrons interacting near a van hove singularity",
    ", we have already seen that @xmath59 is the only component of the interaction which is not irrelevant in the low - energy limit .",
    "this explains why the tendency towards uniform spin order is a natural instability in systems with a large density of states for which the interaction can be modeled by a local coulomb repulsion .",
    "a remarkable feature is that the ferromagnetic instability can be always reached , no matter the strength of the interaction , provided one can place the fermi level arbitrarily close to the van hove singularity .",
    "taking then the expression of the particle - hole susceptibility in ( [ s0 ] ) and assuming a local interaction with constant potential @xmath60 , the instability is found at the critical energy @xmath61 we have anyhow to bear in mind that a very low value of @xmath62 may represent the unfeasibility to observe in practice any instability , if that energy is below the resolution with which one can approach experimentally the singularity .",
    "this also includes the possible effect of disorder , that may attenuate the divergence of the density of states below a certain energy scale as we will discuss later .    regarding the expressions ( [ rc])-([rs ] ) , we point out that it is reassuring their coincidence with the results obtained from a scaling analysis of the van hove singularity@xcite .",
    "that is , the present results can be also interpreted as the lowest order of a renormalization group approach to the singularity .",
    "this level of approximation still misses relevant effects , some of them reinforcing the divergent density of states ( renormalization of the saddle point dispersion ) and others tending to weaken the electronic correlations ( renormalization of the quasiparticle peak)@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , eq .",
    "( [ wc ] ) can be used at least to estimate the order of magnitude of the critical energy scale .",
    "full nonperturbative studies of the low - energy instabilities arising near a van hove singularity ( as those carried out by means of monte carlo simulations in the square lattice@xcite ) have also certified the existence of the ferromagnetic phase , in regions of the phase diagram where the condition @xmath31 is satisfied .",
    "a pairing instability is also possible when the fermi level is close to the van hove singularity , as the strong screening effects make the effective @xmath2-@xmath2 interaction quite anisotropic as a function of the momenta of the electrons .",
    "the tendency towards superconducting order requires however the development of an attractive interaction in any of the channels for the different representations of the point symmetry group .",
    "when this happens , the pairing instability can be greatly enhanced due to the divergent density of states , already reflected in the particle - particle susceptibility given by eq .",
    "( [ cp0 ] ) .",
    "the pairing instability can be studied by looking at the behavior of the so - called bcs vertex , that is the four - fermion interaction vertex for vanishing total momentum and spin of the incoming electrons .",
    "such a function can be parametrized in terms of the angles @xmath63 and @xmath64 of the respective momenta of the spin - up incoming and outgoing electrons .",
    "henceforth we will therefore denote the bcs vertex by @xmath65 , @xmath66 being the energy of the pair of electrons .    adopting a similar methodology as for the ferromagnetic instability",
    ", we will seek to sum up the most divergent contributions to the bcs vertex function .",
    "these can be encoded in the diagrammatic equation represented in fig [ cooper ] , where the second term at the right - hand - side accounts for the divergence of the particle - particle susceptibility .",
    "the particle - particle loop involves an integration in momentum space , that can be parametrized in terms of the differential elements @xmath67 and @xmath68 , longitudinal and normal respectively to the lines of constant energy .",
    "alternatively , one can pass to integration variables defined by the energy @xmath69 of the contour lines and the angle @xmath63 along them .",
    "thus , we end up with the self - consistent equation @xmath70    at this point , one can make contact with the more powerful scaling approach by differentiating with respect to the high - energy cuttof @xmath71 and applying the self - consistency to the right - hand - side of the equation .",
    "then we get @xmath72 this is precisely the equation that one obtains in a renormalization group approach to the pairing instability and , in the present context , it has the advantage of allowing a proper consideration of the effect of the divergent density of states upon scaling in the low - energy limit . the density of states can be actually expressed as @xmath73 where the integral is carried out along a contour line of energy @xmath71",
    ". then we can write eq .",
    "( [ rge ] ) is simpler form by passing to the angular variable @xmath74 in terms of the new function @xmath75 , the scaling equation reads @xmath76    the bcs vertex is a function of the frequency @xmath66 as well as of the high - energy cutoff @xmath71 . under the assumption of scaling",
    ", it must be actually a function of the ratio @xmath77 , so the low - energy limit @xmath78 can be approached by solving eq .",
    "( [ rgn ] ) in the limit of large @xmath71 . in the particular case of approximately constant density of states @xmath79 and angle - independent vertex @xmath80",
    ", the solution of the equation leads to a singularity for attractive interaction @xmath81 , with the well - known relation between the low - energy critical scale @xmath62 and the high - energy cutoff @xmath82 in the proximity of the van hove singularity , however , we see that a pairing instability may be enhanced by the logarithmic divergence of @xmath83 , increasing significantly the value of @xmath62 .    in the case of energy - dependent density of states , we can still resort to an approximation that allows to estimate the strength of a pairing instability by using a relation like ( [ bcs ] ) , in terms of a set of constant effective couplings .",
    "for that purpose , we can introduce in eq .",
    "( [ rge ] ) the change of variables @xmath84 in terms of the redefined vertex , the scaling equation can be then approximated by @xmath85 the vertex ( [ redef ] ) is actually the starting point of usual analyses of the pairing instabilities near a van hove singularity@xcite , where the couplings computed for the effective attraction can be interpreted in the framework of the standard bcs theory .",

    "some of the channels may start however with an attractive effective interaction .",
    "then , as observed from eq .",
    "( [ rg ] ) , this will be enough to trigger a pairing instability at a low - energy critical scale like that in eq .",
    "( [ bcs ] ) .    a sensible way of computing initial values for @xmath91 is to start with a dressed vertex accounting for the effects of the electron - hole polarization not included in the sum of fig .",
    "[ cooper ] .",
    "one can indeed perform the sum of rpa and ladder contributions obtained from iteration of the electron - hole scattering , as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . assuming as in the previous section a local interaction with constant potential @xmath93 in momentum space , the initial value of the bcs vertex is given in this approximation by@xcite @xmath94 with @xmath95 and @xmath96 being the respective momenta at angles @xmath97 over the energy contour line .",
    "the singularity in the fractions of eq .",
    "( [ init ] ) corresponds at vanishing momentum to the ferromagnetic instability discussed in the previous section .",
    "as already mentioned , the mode expansion of ( [ init ] ) may lead however to a negative coupling in some of the channels , making the pairing instability to prevail at a higher critical scale , as we will see in the next section .",
    "in all the relevant instances where a van hove singularity arises in graphene - based systems , the electron - hole susceptibility appears to reach its maximum peak at vanishing momentum transfer .",
    "this narrows down the possible electronic instabilities to either a tendency towards ferromagnetism or towards cooper pairing with unconventional ( preferentially @xmath0-wave ) order parameter .",
    "the case of monolayer graphene with large electron doping is an example of the latter instance , as a result of the strong modulation of the interaction around the extended saddle points in the electronic dispersion .",
    "the tendency to magnetic order turns out to be dominant instead in the twisted graphene bilayers , given the lower degree of symmetry but larger number of saddle points in the dispersion .",
    "the electronic dispersion near the van hove singularity in the conduction band of graphene has been mapped in the arpes experiments reported in ref .",
    "the saddle point dispersion around the m point of the brillouin zone shows an extended character that can not be accounted for by conventional approaches like the lda or gw approximations , reflecting that it arises as an effect of strong electronic correlation .",
    "one can anyhow fit empirically the electronic dispersion by writing down a tight - binding hamiltonian for electron creation ( annihilation ) operators @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) in the honeycomb lattice @xmath100 where the sums account respectively for hopping between first , second and third - neighbor carbon atoms .",

    "the extended character of the saddle points seen in fig .",
    "[ vhmon ] leads to a marked enhancement of the electron - hole susceptibility at vanishing momentum transfer .",
    "moreover , the bcs vertex develops a strong modulation along the fermi line passing near the saddle points , as observed in fig .",
    "the oscillations are translated to the initial condition ( [ init ] ) for the vertex , in such a way that the periodic behavior along the fermi line is dominated by the first harmonics : @xmath101    the expansions ( [ exp1])-([exp3 ] ) match well with the periodicity of the modes for the irreducible representations of the @xmath30 symmetry group .",

    "this leads to folding of the bands of the twisted bilayer into an hexagonal brillouin zone , with reciprocal vectors @xmath151 @xcite .",
    "for relatively large values of @xmath141 compared to @xmath143 , the low - energy physics of the twisted bilayer can be extracted from the hybridization between states around the respective dirac points of the two layers rotated by a small twist @xmath63 . in this approach",

    "one has anyhow to bear in mind that the complete spectrum must be obtained by adding the contribution of a similar hamiltonian representing the hybridization of the dirac cones at the opposite @xmath147 points , which can be obtained by reversing the sign of the @xmath159 variable and exchanging the two layers in eq .",

    "the lowest - energy subbands of the twisted graphene bilayers can be found by diagonalizing the hamiltonian with a sensible representation of the interlayer potentials , in accordance with the symmetry of the hexagonal superlattice .",
    "this implies in particular the periodicity @xmath160 , and the relations @xmath161 , @xmath162 .",
    "a common procedure is to assume that the interlayer hopping is dominated by processes with momentum - transfer @xmath163 or equal to the reciprocal vectors @xmath164 , so that @xmath165 @xcite . for the lowest",

    "[ vhtwist](a ) and [ vhtwist](b ) . in the plots , it is manifest the development of saddle points in the dispersion between each pair of neighboring dirac points , although with a little lateral displacement that breaks the symmetry down to @xmath1 .",
    "\\(a ) ( b ) ( c )    _ pairing instabilities. _ when analyzing the possible pairing instabilities in this system , one has to pay attention to the fact that the fermi line of the twisted bilayer is made of two disconnected sections , which are related by the inversion @xmath167 as represented in fig .",
    "[ vhtwist](c ) .",
    "this means that we can distinguish between two different processes in the scattering of the cooper pairs , depending on whether there is exchange or not of the two electrons from one section of the fermi line to the other .",
    "the strength of the coulomb interaction is different in the two cases , as the exchange of the electrons in the cooper pair implies a large momentum transfer of the order of @xmath168 , while that must be of order @xmath169 when each electron remains in the same section of the fermi line . in the first instance , the coulomb repulsion is given by the unscreened potential @xmath170 . in the other case , the interaction is already screened for momenta @xmath169 .",
    "this effect can be estimated from the charge density required to place the fermi level close to the van hove singularity , located at an energy @xmath171 from the dirac point . applying the charge polarization @xmath172 in the dirac theory for a number of @xmath173 doped dirac cones ( including spin ) in the twisted bilayer @xmath174 we can estimate the strength of the screened coulomb potential as @xmath175",
    "the important point is that , already for a period @xmath176 with @xmath177 , the strength of the effective interaction @xmath178 is about one order of magnitude above that of the unscreened potential @xmath179 .",
    "then , it is safe to neglect the influence of the scattering of cooper pairs with large momentum transfer in the evaluation of the initial condition ( [ init ] ) .",
    "moreover , with the system placed in close proximity to the van hove singularity , the electron - hole susceptibility only experiences a significant enhancement at small momentum .",
    "therefore , in order to study the effect of the singularities at the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ init ] ) , it is justified to discard the second term in favor of the third , which is the only source of a possible pole .",
    "we observe that the previous argument leading to a negative coupling @xmath120 from the relation ( [ v33 ] ) does not apply in the case of the twisted graphene bilayers , as it was based on the dominance of the term depending on @xmath114 in eq .",
    "( [ init ] ) for monolayer graphene . in the present case",
    ", one can still decompose the bcs vertex as a series of the basis functions for irreducible representations of the @xmath1 point symmetry group .",
    "two of these are one - dimensional , corresponding to the sets @xmath180 and @xmath181 for integer @xmath79 , and the remaining is two - dimensional , represented by the set @xmath106 for integer @xmath28 not being a multiple of 3 .",
    "it has to be remarked , however , that the electron - hole susceptibility lacks in the twisted bilayers the very large enhancement at vanishing momentum that was the consequence of the extended character of the van hove singularity in monolayer graphene .",
    "this does not prevent that some negative coupling may arise in any of the channels for the above representations , but one can anticipate that the effect will not correspond now to the dominance of a particular harmonic from the set of basis functions .    to estimate the scale of a possible pairing instability , we have computed the polarization @xmath182 in a grid with @xmath183 points in each hexagon of the the brillouin zone , with the fermi line close to the saddle points of the dispersions represented in fig .",
    "[ vhtwist ] . a characteristic plot of the couplings in the channels with effective attractive interaction is shown in fig .",
    "[ evotw ] .",
    "we observe that the magnitude of the couplings is significantly smaller than that found for the van hove singularity in the conduction band of graphene .",
    "taking into account the correspondence ( [ ctemp ] ) with the critical scale of a possible pairing instability , it is clear that the present effective attraction is too small to give rise to any observable effect in the twisted bilayers .",
    "more importantly , the couplings do not grow large when approaching the singularity in the second fraction of eq .",
    "( [ init ] ) , which means that the corresponding divergence becomes integrable when computing the coefficients in the expansion ( [ dec ] ) .",
    "this implies that the tendency towards pairing can not compete in this case with the instability in the spin response function , no matter how close the van hove singularity is approached .    _",
    "ferromagnetic instability. _ in order to assess the strength of the magnetic instability in the system , we have evaluated @xmath182 along high - symmetry directions down to vanishing momentum , using this time a grid with @xmath184 points covering one of the hexagons of the brillouin zone .",
    "computing at decreasing temperatures and doping levels progressively close to the van hove singularity , we observe the development of a pronounced peak in the susceptibility at zero momentum , as shown in figs . [ ferro](a ) and [ ferro22](a ) .",
    "this is consistent with the logarithmic divergence anticipated in the continuum approach of sec .",
    "as seen in that section , such a behavior implies that , ideally , the singularity in the response function @xmath185 can be reached for any strength of the local coulomb repulsion , simply by lowering the temperature and approaching sufficiently close the van hove singularity .",
    "\\(a ) ( b )    we remark that , in the model of the bilayer superlattice , the spin - dependent interaction @xmath186 arises at a microscopic level from the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath187 at each carbon atom .",
    "the eigenstates in each subband of the twisted bilayer can be written as linear combinations of the atomic orbitals in the superlattice unit cell , normalized according to the number @xmath188 of atoms it contains .",
    "this means that , after projecting into the lowest - energy subband , @xmath189 must be of the order of @xmath190 , having a magnitude that decreases in the sequence of twisted bilayers as the inverse of @xmath191 .",
    "that has to be confronted with the critical values that are predicted from the position of the pole in the response function @xmath185 , which we have represented for a twisted bilayer with @xmath166 in fig .",
    "[ ferro](b ) . assuming a magnitude of the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath192 ev @xcite , we obtain @xmath193 ev for that particular superlattice .",
    "we see that such an interaction strength can not match the lowest critical couplings represented in the figure , staying in close proximity to the van hove singularity .",
    "thus , for the corresponding twisted bilayer , a signature of the magnetic instability should be only expected at a temperature @xmath194 k.    \\(a ) ( b )    we have anyhow to bear in mind that the band structure of the twisted bilayers undergoes important changes as the period @xmath176 increases , with a progressive reduction in the width of the lowest - energy subband .",
    "it has been actually found that such a bandwidth has a recurrent behavior , narrowing down to approximately zero energy at a sequence of `` magic \" twist angles@xcite .",
    "the first instance at which this happens corresponds to @xmath195 .",
    "then , in the way towards this magic angle , the lowest subband of the bilayer becomes increasingly flat , which has a significant impact on the values of the electron - hole susceptibility .",
    "this can be appreciated in the plot of fig .",
    "[ ferro22](a ) , which shows the result of computing @xmath182 for a twisted bilayer with @xmath196 .",
    "from the position of the pole in the spin response function @xmath185 , one can calculate again the critical values of the interaction strength needed to reach the magnetic instability .",
    "these are represented in fig .",
    "[ ferro22](b ) as a function of the temperature and the deviation of the filling level with respect to the van hove singularity . with a rough estimate of @xmath197 ev for the corresponding twisted bilayer , we find that the onset of the instability may now take place at temperatures approaching the order of magnitude of @xmath198 k.    while the ferromagnetic instability is increasingly amplified for twisted bilayers becoming closer to the first magic angle at @xmath195 , it is clear that our computational approach must become at some point unreliable to estimate quantitatively the critical interaction strength . as mentioned before , the framework described in sec .",
    "iia leads to results similar to those obtained in a renormalization group approach to the magnetic instability . from this point of view",
    ", the present computational scheme is justified whenever the interaction strength is much smaller than the bandwidth of the electron system .",
    "this certainly happens in the two cases considered with @xmath166 and 22 .",
    "the scaling approach must break down however in twisted bilayers for some larger lattice constant as the bandwidth goes to zero , leaving then ferromagnetism as a likely instability but much harder to analyze quantitatively .",
    "in this paper we have studied the many - body instabilities of electrons interacting near van hove singularities arising in monolayer and twisted bilayer graphene . in the first instance , we have taken advantage of the experimental data available for the dispersion around the saddle points in the conduction band of graphene@xcite . while reaching the level of the singularity requires there a large amount of doping , the results obtained from arpes have unveiled the extended character of the saddle point dispersion , showing the potential for a large instability of the electron system . on the other hand , twisted graphene bilayers have van hove singularities that arise from the hybridization of the dirac cones of the two layers , being therefore located at relatively low energies from the charge neutrality point .",
    "they can be more easily reached upon doping , but have the disadvantage of involving in general a weaker singularity in the density of states , with lower strength of the consequent electronic instabilities .",
    "we have seen that a pairing instability must be dominant over the tendency to magnetic order as the fermi level is tuned to the van hove singularity in the conduction band of graphene . as a result of the extended character of the saddle points in the dispersion",
    ", we have found that the pairing of the electrons must take place preferentially in a channel of @xmath0-wave symmetry , with an order parameter vanishing at the position of the saddle points along the fermi line . in the case of the twisted bilayers ,",
    "the dispersion has instead its symmetry reduced down to the @xmath1 group and , most importantly , it leads to susceptibilities that diverge at the saddle points but are integrable along the fermi line .",
    "this implies that the attractive couplings for the pairing instability do not grow large when approaching the critical interaction strength marking the onset of magnetic order .",
    "thus , the magnetic instability becomes prevalent in the twisted graphene bilayers , with a dominant tendency towards ferromagnetism as the uniform magnetic susceptibility inherits the divergence in the density of states at the van hove singularity .",
    "the divergence of the electron - hole susceptibility is the driving force for pairing and magnetic instabilities at the van hove singularity . in principle",
    ", such a susceptibility can be made arbitrarily large in the limit of vanishing temperature . in practice , however , there is a restriction to that growth coming from the effects of disorder or defects in the carbon lattice .",
    "these have the ability to smear the singularity in the density of states , reducing its nominal strength .",
    "the most dangerous effect comes in that respect from the scattering off impurities , and the analysis made in the two - dimensional square lattice has shown that the logarithmic singularity in the density of states is suppressed by corrections that depend on the function @xmath199 , @xmath200 being the nearest - neighbor hopping amplitude and @xmath201 the relaxation time@xcite . in our case , for sufficiently clean samples , we can assume for instance a value of the mean free path in the carbon lattice of the order of @xmath202 m , which would imply a relaxation time @xmath203 .",
    "thus , we see that the divergence in the density of states may not suffer a significant attenuation when probed with a resolution of @xmath131 mev",
    ". this level of approximation to the singularity may be small enough to observe the onset of the electronic instabilities since , as shown above , it corresponds to doping levels at which experimental signatures can be seen for reasonable values of the interaction strength in monolayer as well as in twisted bilayer graphene .",
    "the results presented in this paper may serve as a guide for the effects that can be measured in real graphene samples near a van hove singularity .",
    "renormalization group methods have shown to provide in general a predictable approach to the low - energy physics of the singular density of states , where effects like the quasiparticle attenuation may be compensated in part by the renormalization of the saddle point dispersion@xcite .",
    "the carbon - based systems studied in the present paper may provide an appropriate playground to test many of the physical effects predicted , including the regime of strong correlations supposed to arise in the vicinity of the van hove singularity .",
