    "the fate of doped mott insulators is one of the most challenging issues in correlated electron physics , especially in relation to the long - standing problem of high - temperature superconductivity in cuprates @xcite .",
    "recent discoveries of various mott insulators on geometrically frustrated lattices @xcite and organic materials @xcite may offer an important clue to this issue when such materials are doped . while it is possible that the ground state does not break any symmetry , resulting in a spin liquid phase ,",
    "the ground states of mott insulators often have broken spin - rotation and lattice - translation symmetries , leading to antiferromagnetic and valence bond solid order , respectively @xcite . since both antiferromagnetic and valence bond",
    "solid phases are generic possibilities for mott insulators , a zero - temperature quantum phase transition may occur between these two phases when an appropriate `` control parameter '' is changed @xcite . in this context , understanding the effect of doping on valence - bond solid phases is as equally important as that on antiferromagnetic phases and would be quite useful for the full classification of all possible phases of doped mott insulators .",
    "there are , however , not many clear examples of two - dimensional valence - bond solid insulator in contrast to the antiferromagnetic insulator found in high @xmath5 cuprate compounds . the discovery of srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 is particularly important in this regard @xcite .",
    "this material can be characterized by an antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 heisenberg model on the shastry - sutherland lattice @xcite .",
    "starting from the usual square lattice , the shastry - sutherland lattice can be obtained by putting additional diagonal bonds with two possible orientations in alternating plaquettes ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "let @xmath3 and @xmath6 be the exchange couplings along the diagonal and the square lattice links , respectively .",
    "it is known that the valence bond solid state or the product state of valence bond singlets ( illustrated as filled ellipses in fig.1 ) along the diagonal bonds is the exact ground state of the heisenberg model for @xmath7 @xcite . in srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 , @xmath8 is estimated to be 0.64 @xcite .",
    ", is larger than a critical value , @xmath9 , the plaquette @xmath10-wave superconductivity appears in a range of doping concentration , @xmath11 , with a peculiar spatial pattern as shown in the right figure . in this situation ,",
    "the pairing amplitudes residing in the four links encircling the horizontal dimers have the opposite sign to those for the vertical dimers .",
    "different colors are used to emphasize the plaquette pattern of the pairing amplitude.,width=283 ]    in this paper , we investigate possible phases of doped valence - bond solid and superconductivity on the shastry - sutherland lattice . in order to study the interplay between the valence - bond solid order and emergent superconductivity at finite doping",
    ", we use the bond operator formulation @xcite of the constrained hilbert space of correlated electron systems , extended to general doping and applied to the @xmath2-@xmath3-@xmath4 model . here",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath4 represent the hopping strength and nearest - neighbor repulsion between electrons , respectively .",
    "in contrast to previous studies of the shastry - sutherland model @xcite , the emergent superconducting state is directly related to the underlying valence - bond solid order at the half - filling .",
    "for example , the valence - bond solid order is so robust that superconductivity always coexists with it as shown in the resulting phase diagram of fig .  2 .",
    "when the nearest - neighbor repulsion , @xmath4 , is smaller than a critical value @xmath9 , the doped holes can remian paired mostly _ within _ each valence - bond singlet or dimer on the diagonal bonds .",
    "this leads to @xmath12-wave superconductivity . on the other hand , when @xmath4 is larger than @xmath9 , the coulomb repulsion prevents doped holes from occupying the same dimer . at larger doping concentrations ,",
    "the doped holes tend to develop pairing correlation between nearby dimers of the valence - bond singlets .",
    "consequently the superconducting order paramter acquires an interesting phase relation on the square lattice link , depending on whether the square lattice links encircle the horizontal or vertical dimers ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "more specifically , all the links within the same plaquette have the same sign , but those in the nearest - neighbor plaquettes have the opposite sign . since this looks like @xmath10-wave symmetry at long distances , we call it the _ plaquette _ @xmath10-wave superconductivity .",
    "notice , however , that this is different from the ordinary @xmath13-wave superconductor on the square lattice where the sign alternates for different links within the same plaquette .",
    "this peculiar structure comes from the underlying valence bond solid order .",
    "the simultaneous presence of the valence bond order and superconductivity can , in principle , be checked by x - ray or neutron scattering experiments .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",

    "we start with the bond operator theory by setting up an exact mapping between bond operators and usual electron creation operators @xcite .",
    "let @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) be the electron creation operators on the left and right site , respectively , of the lattice link that a horizontal dimer occupies ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) . in the limit of large on - site repulsive interaction , @xmath18 , any state with two electrons at the same site",
    "is excluded from the low - energy hilbert space which in turn can be represented by nine `` bond - particle '' creation operators defined as follows :    \\(i ) singlet boson for spin - peierls order , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the electron vacuum and @xmath21 is the imaginary vacuum void of any bond particle .",
    "@xmath22 is the second - rank antisymmetric tensor with @xmath23 . from now on we adopt the summation convention for repeated spin indices ( such as @xmath24 and @xmath25 above ) throughout this paper unless mentioned otherwise .",

    "\\(iii ) single - hole fermion , @xmath27    \\(iv ) double - hole boson for the empty state , @xmath28    as indicated by the names , the operators @xmath29 , @xmath13 , and @xmath30 all obey the canonical boson commutation relations while @xmath31 and @xmath32 satisfy the canonical fermion anticommutation relations .",
    "to eliminate unphysical states from the enlarged hilbert space , the following constraint needs to be imposed on the bond - particle hilbert space : @xmath33 constrained by this equation , the exact expressions for the spin and electron creation operators can be written in terms of the bond operators .",
    "for example , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the third rank antisymmetric tensor with @xmath36 .",
    "now , in order to cover the full shastry - sutherland lattice , we need nine additional bond operators representing the electronic hilbert space associated with the vertical dimers corresponding to the sites 3 and 4 .",
    "for example , @xmath37 indicates the triplet magnon in the vertical dimers while @xmath38 and @xmath39 represent the corresponding single - hole fermions .",
    "while non - uniform condensations of the spin - peierls singlet and/or double - hole bosons are in general possible , we focus only on the uniform phases in this study .",
    "thus the condensation densities of the singlet and double - hole bosons will be represented by @xmath40 and @xmath41 for both horizontal and vertical dimers .",
    "we consider the following @xmath2-@xmath3-@xmath4 hamiltonian : @xmath42 \\hat{p}_\\textrm{g } \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the gutzwiller projection operator imposing the no - double - occupancy constraint . @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the electron hopping matrix element and antiferromagnetic exchange interaction , respectively . in this paper , we set @xmath46 and @xmath47 within a dimer , @xmath48 and @xmath49 between neighboring dimers . we take @xmath50 from the experiments on srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 @xcite . from the large-@xmath18 expansion of the hubbard model , we can then set @xmath51 . however , the parameter , @xmath52 , which is important for hole dynamics , is not available experimentally .",
    "thus we follow the convention used in previous works @xcite and take @xmath53 .",
    "also , @xmath54 is the chemical potential and @xmath55 is the electron density operator . finally , for convenience , the nearest - neighbor repulsive interaction , @xmath56 , is set to @xmath4 for both the two sites within dimer and those between the nearest - neighbor dimers .",
    "we now write the @xmath2-@xmath3-@xmath4 hamiltonian solely in terms of the bond particle operators @xcite . as usual , the constraint on the bond particle operators is imposed by the lagrange multiplier method .",
    "residual interactions between bond particles are analyzed via quadratic decoupling of quartic terms in a similar manner to the usual hartree - fock - bcs treatment .",
    "for the mean - field description , we consider the following order parameters : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the dimer index of the horizontal dimers and @xmath59 indicates the locations of the neighboring vertical dimers .",
    "the order parameters for the @xmath60-direction can be defined similarly .",
    "we consider the possibility that the valence - bond - solid order persists even at non - zero doping .",
    "we further consider the condensation of @xmath13 bosons , but neglect the possibility of triplet condensation because we are mostly concerned about paramagnetic phases in this work .",
    "all of the order parameters ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 for both @xmath11 and @xmath60 directions ) defined above as well as @xmath40 , @xmath41 , the chemical potential , @xmath54 , and the lagrange multiplier , @xmath65 , are determined by solving a coupled set of four saddle - point equations and eight self - consistency equations .",
    "details of the computational procedure are presented in the appendix .",
    "at zero doping , the system is in a robust valence - bond solid phase . in our bond operator theory ,",
    "the robustness of the ground state can be seen by the complete localization of triplet magnons : the @xmath66 and @xmath67 dispersions are completely flat and high in energy .",
    "it can easily be shown that , at the quadratic order , the triplet magnons on the shastry - sutherland lattice are completely decoupled from the singlet contributions ( notice that the coupling between the singlets and triplets at the quadratic order were the main driving force for the triplet dispersion in the square - lattice case @xcite ) .",
    "this leads to the triplet hamiltonian with no dispersive quadratic part .",
    "thus , the only way to generate the triplet dispersion is through the saddle - point order parameters , @xmath68 , @xmath69,@xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "it turns out , however , that all of the above order parameters are actually zero for any @xmath8 at half filling in our mean - field theory so that the triplets are completely localized .    , as well as condensation densities of the spin - peierls singlets , @xmath40 , and double - hole bosons , @xmath41 , as a function of hole concentration , @xmath11 .",

    "two electrons within the same dimer lose their independent local coordinates and share the same single dimer index .",

    "when two holes are doped into a unit cell , there are two possible configurations as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] .",
    "first , two electrons are removed from the same dimer while the other remains intact . in this case , only one singlet pair is removed , which costs the energy of @xmath111 with an additional coulomb energy gain due to the disappearance of nearest - neighboring electrons : @xmath112 .",
    "thus the total energy cost would be @xmath113 .",
    "second , when two electrons are removed from two dimers , i.e. , one hole remains at each dimer , there are twice the coulomb energy gain and twice the exchange energy cost for breaking two singlet pairs .",
    "the total energy cost for the second case is @xmath114 . in conclusion ,",
    "the energy - cost difference between two configurations is @xmath115 . if @xmath116 , the first configuration is preferred and the @xmath13 bosons can condense . on the other hand , if @xmath117 , the second configuration is favored and the @xmath13 bosons may not condense depending on @xmath11 , which is precisely the case as shown in the bottom figure of fig .",
