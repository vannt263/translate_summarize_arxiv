    "<S> in this fluid dynamics video , we present the first time - resolved measurements of the oscillatory velocity field induced by swimming unicellular microorganisms . </S>",
    "<S> confinement of the green alga _ c. reinhardtii _ in stabilized thin liquid films allows simultaneous tracking of cells and tracer particles . </S>",
    "<S> the measured velocity field reveals complex time - dependent flow structures , and scales inversely with distance . the instantaneous mechanical power generated by the cells </S>",
    "<S> is measured from the velocity fields and peaks at 15 fw . </S>",
    "<S> the dissipation per cycle is more than four times what steady swimming would require . </S>"
