    "as is well - known , localized electronic moments ( spins ) in mott - insulating materials typically interact with near - neighbours via antiferromagnetic exchange interactions which can be much bigger than the weak magnetic dipole interactions between these localized moments .",
    "the possibility that such quantum antiferromagnets remain in a liquid - like phase down to the lowest temperature has attracted sustained interest since the early work of fazekas and anderson@xcite .",
    "this has motivated the study of candidate wavefunctions that describe various quantum spin liquid ground states . here , our focus is on a particular construction that works directly in the overcomplete basis of singlet ( valence ) bonds between spins , by specifying amplitudes for various ways in which the spins can pair up to make singlets .",
    "the full `` resonating valence bond '' ( rvb ) wavefunction is then a superposition of all these possibilities , with these amplitudes chosen by some physically motivated rule .",
    "on bipartite lattices , it is possible to choose the phase of these amplitudes so as to satisfy the marshall sign - rule@xcite , which is known to be obeyed in the ground state of a large class of antiferromagnets .",
    "indeed , in their original study of such rvb wavefunctions on the square lattice , liang , doucot and anderson@xcite had fixed the sign - structure in this manner to study the variational energy of the square - lattice @xmath1 heisenberg antiferromagnet as a function of the length distribution of valence bonds .",
    "they concluded that the short - ranged rvb wavefunction with valence - bonds allowed only between pairs of nearest - neighbour spins gives a variational energy that is only slightly higher than that of a trial nel ordered state , which has long - ranged valence - bonds in this basis .",
    "more recent work has built on these results in several ways : first , tang , sandvik and henley@xcite and albuquerque and alet@xcite revisited the square lattice nearest - neighbour rvb ( nnrvb ) wavefunction using the loop algorithm of sandvik and evertz@xcite to sample expectation values in the nnrvb wavefunction .",
    "they found that bond - energy correlations have a slow , oscillatory power - law decay .",
    "this is in complete contrast to the extremely short - ranged spin correlations in this wavefunction .",
    "second , cano and fendley@xcite constructed a spin hamiltonian with short - ranged couplings whose ground state is the nnrvb wavefunction on the square lattice .",
    "third , one of the present authors , in collaboration with dhar and ramola , developed a cluster - expansion approach that relates the bond - energy correlations in this square lattice wavefunction to dimer correlations of a specific interacting dimer model , whose leading interaction is an attraction between pairs of parallel dimers on adjacent bonds of the square lattice@xcite .",
    "some aspects of this correspondence were also checked by stphan _ et .",
    "al._@xcite in their study of the entanglement properties of this wavefunction .",
    "in the three - dimensional case , albuquerque , alet and moessner@xcite showed that the nnrvb wavefunction on the cubic and diamond lattices has long - range antiferromagnetic order , underlining the importance of dimensionality in determining the nature of correlations in this kind of variational wavefunction .",
    "additionally , recent work by xu and beach@xcite suggests that an anisotropic version of the three - dimensional nnrvb wavefunction describes interesting spin - liquid behaviour .",
    "in the present study , we focus on extending these results to antiferromagnets on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "our primary motivation is to test the correspondence between bond - energy correlations in the nnrvb wavefunction and dimer correlations of a fully - packed dimer model with certain interactions , the form of which we derive here using the methods of ref .  .",
    "to this end , we study both sides of this correspondence using monte - carlo simulations .",
    "our computational results rely heavily on a new update - scheme@xcite that allows a more efficient and ergodic monte - carlo sampling of valence - bond configurations when used in conjunction with the sandvik - evertz algorithm@xcite . to place both our wavefunction and dimer model results in the context of a long - wavelength height - model description@xcite",
    ", we first provide a self - contained account of the correspondence between the height - model stiffness and power - law exponents for dimer and bond - energy correlators , and derive the form of the dependence of the reduced dimer partition function on winding numbers .",
    "although both these results are available in earlier literature@xcite , our formulation of the latter may be of some independent interest since it makes explicit the three - fold symmetry of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the rest of this article is organized as follows : in section  [ loops ] we establish the correspondence between the nnrvb wavefunction on the honeycomb lattice and an interacting fully - packed dimer model on the same lattice , with a specific form of the interactions , which we derive . in section  [ heights ] , we discuss the coarse - grained height - model description of fully - packed dimers on the honeycomb lattice , paying particular attention to features that are specific to the honeycomb lattice case .",
    "we derive the dependence of the restricted partition function on winding number sectors , and summarize the correspondence between height - model stiffness and various power - law exponents .",
    "we also indicate how this can be carried over to our wavefunction studies . in section",
    "[ algorithm ] , we summarize a new update - scheme@xcite for monte - carlo sampling of valence - bond configurations , and explain how it improves the ergodicity of our simulations when used in conjunction with the well - known sandvik - evertz algorithm@xcite . in section  [ numerics",
    "] , we describe our numerical results on the nnrvb wavefunction for su(@xmath5 ) antiferromagnets ( with @xmath12 ) and the corresponding interacting dimer model , and demonstrate that the dimer correlations in the latter provides a rather good account of the bond - energy correlations in the former .",
    "we close with a brief discussion of our results in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "and @xmath13 represent the two flippable configurations of dimers around a hexagon ( here dimers are represented by ellipses ) .",
    "the weight of configuration @xmath14 in the interacting dimer model gets contributions from the two loop configurations @xmath15 and @xmath16 of the loop model equivalent to the nnrvb wavefunction .",
    "this is captured by the effective interactions between dimers worked out in the text . ]",
    "shows a configuration with two flippable hexagons that share a dimer .",
    "the weight for such a configuration in the interacting dimer model gets contributions from loop configurations @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "similarly , @xmath20 represents one of the two flippable arrangements of dimers around on the perimeter of a double - hexagon .",
    "the weight for such a configuration in the interacting dimer model gets contributions from loop configurations @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath18 . ]",
    "the nearest neighbour rvb wavefunction for a bipartite su(@xmath0 ) antiferromagnet with @xmath1 spins at each site is given by a uniform amplitude superposition of all possible su(@xmath0 ) valence bond solid states in which each spin makes a singlet with one of its neighbours .",
    "this construction generalizes readily to the su(@xmath5 ) case when the su(@xmath5 ) spins on one sublattice carry the fundamental representation and those on the other sublattice carry the complex conjugate of the fundamental . in general , we write @xmath23 where @xmath24 where @xmath25 is any complete dimer cover of the bipartite lattice , @xmath26 denotes all links covered by dimers of @xmath25 , @xmath27 is the su(@xmath5 ) singlet state of the two spins connected by @xmath26 , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote the a and b sublattice sites connected by link @xmath26 .",
    "the norm is given by : @xmath30 which can be written as the partition function of a fully packed loop model with non - intersecting loops@xcite .",
    "to see this , one notes that a superposition of two fully - packed dimer - covers gives a fully - packed configuration of loops .",
    "thus , we identify the inner product of @xmath31 and @xmath32 with the loop configuration @xmath33 whose weight @xmath34 is determined by the quantum - mechanical overlap between these two singlet states .",
    "the norm of the wavefunction can thus be written as the loop gas partition function @xmath35 here , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the number of trivial length - two loops ( doubled - edges ) in the loop configuration @xmath33 ( corresponding to bra and ket valence bonds occupying the same link ) and @xmath38 is the number of non - trivial ( length - four or more ) loops in @xmath33 .",
    "operator expectation values in this wavefunction , such as spin correlation and bond - energy correlation functions , are obtained from monte - carlo estimators defined entirely in terms of this loop gas@xcite .",
    "for instance , in the su(@xmath0 ) case , the two - point correlation function of spins is simply three - fourth of the probability that both spins lie on the same overlap loop .",
    "the estimator for the two - point function of the bond - energy operator @xmath39 corresponding to a nearest - neighbour bond @xmath40 , _ i.e. _ the correlation of bond - energies at @xmath41 and @xmath42 , is only slightly more complicated : it involves the probabilities for various ways in which the four points @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath26 lie on at most two loops of the loop gas@xcite .",
    "both these results have natural generalizations@xcite to the su(@xmath5 ) case .    as was noted in earlier work@xcite ,",
    "if the loop gas is in a short - loop phase , corresponding to exponentially decaying spin correlations in the rvb wavefunction , there is a precise mapping between the loop gas and an interacting fully - packed dimer model defined on the same bipartite lattice .",
    "this mapping is perturbative in @xmath46 , and leads to a dimer model with @xmath47-dimer interactions whose strength decays rapidly with @xmath47 when @xmath5 is large . under this mapping ,",
    "bond - energy correlators in the rvb wavefunction map to dimer correlators in this interacting dimer model , apart from an overall prefactor@xcite . in the square - lattice case , this mapping has proved to be a useful way to understand the power - law bond - energy correlations in the su(@xmath0 ) wavefunction@xcite .    here , we use this approach@xcite to derive the form of this interacting dimer model for the honeycomb lattice case . following ref .  , the @xmath47-dimer interaction is given recursively by the following relation : @xmath48=v_n(d_n)+\\sum^{n-1}_{m=1}\\sum_{{d_m}\\epsilon{d_n}}{v_m}(d_m),\\ ] ] where @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes all possible loop configurations that contribute to the weight of a given @xmath47-dimer configuration @xmath51 , and @xmath52 denotes all sub - configurations of this @xmath47-dimer configuration . using the above relation",
    ", we see that the one - body potential ( fugacity ) goes as @xmath53 .",
    "this simply says that each dimer contributes a factor of @xmath5 to the dimer model partition function ; since we are considering a fully - packed dimer model , this just fixes the overall normalization of the partition function . from this recursion relation",
    ", we also see that every two - body term is zero .",
    "the only three - body term lives on a flippable hexagon ( dimer configurations labeled @xmath14 and @xmath13 in fig  [ fig1 ] ) , which has two possible loop configurations that contribute to the weight of each such flippable dimer configuration ; for instance , loop configurations labeled @xmath54 and @xmath55 contribute to the dimer configuration labeled @xmath14 in fig  [ fig1 ] ( and similarly for @xmath13 ) .",
    "thus , flippable hexagons are favoured in the interacting dimer model by an attractive three - body term : @xmath56 using these results , it is easy to see that the four - body potential is zero .",
    "there are two five - dimer configurations which have a non - zero interaction energy ( fig  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the first , labeled @xmath57 in fig",
    ".  [ fig2 ] , gets contributions from loop configurations @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 as shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] . the second , labeled @xmath20 , gets contributions from loop configurations @xmath18 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "thus , we have the two five - body interaction potentials @xmath58 @xmath59 from this recursive analysis , it is easy to see that @xmath47-body terms , when non - zero , are generally of order @xmath60 for @xmath61 . in our computations",
    "we only use the leading order non - trivial interaction ( which is the three - body term ) .",
    "as we will see in later sections , this already gives a rather good account of the bond - energy correlators in the su(@xmath5 ) wavefunction for @xmath12 .",
    "in this section , we lay the groundwork to place both our wavefunction and dimer model results in the context of a long - wavelength height - model description@xcite . to this end",
    ", we provide a self - contained account of the correspondence between the height - model stiffness and power - law exponents for dimer and bond - energy correlators , and derive the form of the dependence of the reduced partition function on winding numbers .",
    "although both these results are available in earlier literature@xcite , our formulation of the latter may be of some independent interest since it makes explicit the three - fold symmetry of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "we begin by defining a microscopic height field @xmath62 on the triangular lattice dual to the honeycomb lattice ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) in the following manner : given a configuration of dimers on the honeycomb lattice , and fixing the height at the origin of the triangular lattice to be @xmath63 , we construct @xmath62 on sites @xmath64 of the dual triangular lattice using the rules give below @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 where @xmath68 is @xmath69 if the @xmath70 type bond belonging to point @xmath71 ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) is occupied by a dimer and @xmath72 otherwise . here , @xmath73 is the coordinate of a @xmath29-sublattice site of the honeycomb lattice , we assign the same coordinate to the @xmath28-sublattice site `` belonging '' to @xmath71 ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , and @xmath74 is the coordinate of the corresponding dual triangular lattice site that coincides with the center of the hexagon vertically above this @xmath29-sublattice site . clearly , this microscopic height @xmath75 is uniquely defined for all fully - packed configurations , and takes on one - third - integer values .     and @xmath29 `` belonging '' to each bravais lattice point @xmath76 with integer @xmath77 and @xmath47 , which , in our convention , is the coordinate of the @xmath29-sublattice site .",
    "when talking of bond - energies or dimer occupation numbers , we use the convention that three types of bonds @xmath72 , @xmath69 , and @xmath0 `` belong '' to each @xmath71 , as shown in the figure . ]",
    "-sublattice honeycomb sites are labeled by @xmath71 and their corresponding triangular lattice counterparts are labeled @xmath64 . also shown here",
    "are the lines across which dimer or valence - bond flux is calculated to get three winding numbers @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 as described in the text . ]",
    "as is well - understood@xcite , a fully - packed dimer configuration , and `` nearby '' configurations accessible to it via local rearrangements , all correspond to the same coarse - grained height - field .",
    "dimer states with many such nearby configurations give rise to a coarse - grained height - field with small tilt .",
    "if the dimer model is in a power - law ordered state , one expects that long - wavelength fluctuations of the height - field will be determined by this entropic cost of tilting the height configuration , while the restriction that @xmath75 takes on values that are one - third of an integer is expected to be irrelevant as far as long - distance properties are concerned .",
    "one therefore postulates that long - wavelength properties of such fully - packed dimer models are captured by a coarse - grained _ real - valued _ height field @xmath81 whose statistics is governed by a gaussian action@xcite @xmath82 , _",
    "i.e _ a statistical weight proportional to @xmath83 .    here",
    ", we prefer a hybrid approach whereby we work with a _ real - valued _ height field @xmath84 that is defined on the dual triangular lattice sites @xmath64 .",
    "this is equivalent to re - discretizing the coarse - grained height action on the dual triangular lattice , instead of imposing an isotropic cutoff in momentum - space .",
    "thus , we postulate that a height configuration @xmath84 has statistical weight @xmath85 , where @xmath86 has the form @xmath87 where the sum is over all nearest neighbour bonds @xmath88 of the triangular lattice , and @xmath89 is a phenomenological stiffness constant .    as is well - known@xcite , long - distance properties of correlations of @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) are well - described in this language by an operator correspondence made up of two parts .",
    "one part , in the vicinity of the uniform wavevector @xmath92 , is given by lattice - gradients of @xmath93 , and follows directly from the construction of the microscopic heights outlined earlier , while the other part@xcite encodes physics in the vicinity of wavevector @xmath94 , which is the wavevector corresponding to columnar ordering in the honeycomb dimer model .",
    "more explicitly , we have : @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath97 where @xmath98 is a phenomenological constant , @xmath99 denotes the lattice - gradient in the positive @xmath100 direction ( @xmath101 ) along the link of the dual triangular lattice which cuts across the honeycomb lattice bond labeled @xmath102 ( fig .  [ fig3 ] and fig .  [ fig4 ] ) , and @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) denotes the average of @xmath84 over the three triangular lattice points surrounding the honeycomb lattice point labeled by @xmath105 and @xmath71 .    in our simulations , we study the nnrvb wavefunction and the corresponding interacting dimer model on @xmath106 lattices with periodicity of @xmath33 lattice units in the @xmath107 and @xmath108 directions . on such periodic lattices , fully - packed dimer configurations may be labeled by three winding numbers satisfying one constraint .",
    "the winding numbers are defined in terms of the number of dimers @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 that are encountered as we follow the dotted lines @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 around the torus ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the definition is simply @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "clearly @xmath117 in any fully - packed configuration , since the total number of dimers of all orientations equals @xmath118 and @xmath119 are independent of where we cut the lattice to count these integers ( both these statements are a straightforward consequence of the fully - packed nature of each configuration ) .",
    "for @xmath33 a multiple of @xmath120 ( as is always the case in our numerics ) , @xmath121 are integers . for the coarse - grained height field used in our analytical effective field - theory calculations ,",
    "these integers define twisted boundary conditions , whereby @xmath84 changes by an amount equal to @xmath121 upon winding around the torus in the positive @xmath100 direction . in a coarse - grained sense",
    ", this corresponds to a constant gradient of strength @xmath122 in the @xmath100 direction .",
    "therefore , the relative statistical weight of winding sector @xmath123 of the honeycomb dimer model is expected to be proportional to @xmath124 thus , simply measuring the relative frequency of different winding sectors in a monte - carlo simulation gives a direct handle on the phenomenological stiffness parameter @xmath89 .",
    "this is one of three ways in which we extract @xmath89 in our simulations .",
    "as we now discuss , the other two ways have to do with dimer correlations at wavevectors @xmath125 and @xmath126 in the vicinity of @xmath72 .    for wavevectors",
    "near @xmath127 , if we measure solely in the zero - winding sector ( corresponding to periodic boundary conditions on @xmath81 ) , we expect @xmath128 @xmath129 and @xmath130 in the limit @xmath131 . here",
    ", the subscript indicates that we take only the connected part of this correlation function and measure only in the zero - winding sector , and we have used the convention @xmath132 where @xmath133 and @xmath134 are reciprocal lattice vectors satisfying @xmath135 and @xmath136 . each of the @xmath119 approach a limiting value of @xmath137 when @xmath126 is taken to zero along two directions each : thus , @xmath138 approaches this value when @xmath139 or @xmath140 , @xmath141 approaches this value when @xmath142 or @xmath140 , and @xmath143 approaches this value when @xmath144 or @xmath145 .",
    "this suggests that we may estimate @xmath89 rather accurately from @xmath146 , the average of these six limits .    on the other hand ,",
    "the connected correlation function of @xmath68 at large spatial separation is dominated by the physics at wavevector @xmath147 .",
    "for instance , from the operator correspondence displayed earlier , we expect @xmath148 evaluating the expectation value on the right - hand - side using the effective action @xmath86 , we find @xmath149 where @xmath150 with @xmath151 in other words , we expect correlators at wavevector @xmath152 to decay as a power - law , with power - law exponent @xmath153 ; this reflects the power - law valence - bond solid ( vbs ) order present in the system .",
    "we therefore expect that a measurement of such power - law correlators at large spatial separations provides a third independent way of extracting @xmath89 .",
    "turning to the nnrvb wavefunction , we note that the valence - bonds in the bra define one fully - packed dimer configuration while the valence - bonds in the ket define another fully - packed dimer configuration .",
    "the results of ref .   imply that these two dimer configurations have exponentially small probability for being in two different winding sectors for large @xmath33 .",
    "this is expected to be true whenever the wavefunction represents a genuine spin - liquid , or , equivalently , whenever all overlap loops are small .",
    "since this is the case in our wavefunction study , we restrict attention to the sub - class of loop - model configurations in which there is no net winding of the loops . in this restricted ensemble , which we study numerically when we sample the nnrvb wavefunction",
    ", the definition of winding sectors given for the dimer model goes over unchanged : we simply keep track of the common winding numbers @xmath121 of the bra / ket valence - bond configuration .",
    "this allows us to obtain an effective @xmath154 for the wavefunction directly from the analog of eqn .",
    "[ kappa1 ] , by simply keeping track of the histogram of these winding numbers .    from the analysis of ref .",
    ", we also expect that the connected bond - energy correlator @xmath155 where @xmath71 is the separtion between bonds @xmath156 and @xmath157 and @xmath158 is the singlet projector on bond @xmath41 , has the same long - distance behaviour as the connected dimer correlation of dimers living on these two bonds .",
    "therefore , by measuring this quantity and fitting to an oscillatory power - law decay @xmath159 , we can extract a power - law exponent @xmath160 for the wavefunction , and thence , an effective stiffness parameter @xmath161 exactly as in eqn .",
    "[ kappa5 ] and eqn .",
    "[ kappa6 ] in the dimer case .",
    "finally , we may form the average @xmath162 ( @xmath101 ) of the valence - bond occupation variables in the bra and the ket configuration , and consider the connected correlation functions of @xmath162 near wavevector @xmath163 . from the results of ref .",
    ", we expect these to have behaviour exactly analogous to that displayed in eqn .",
    "[ kappa2 ] , eqn .",
    "[ kappa3 ] , and eqn .",
    "[ kappa4 ] for the dimer model . by measuring @xmath146 , the average of the six different small @xmath164 limits defined earlier",
    ", we expect to obtain a third independent estimate of the effective stiffness parameter @xmath165 for the su(@xmath5 ) wavefunction .",
    "these prescriptions for extracting an effective stiffness @xmath165 from our wavefunction simulations are in direct correspondence with similar ideas used in ref .   in the square - lattice case .",
    "our simulations of the interacting dimer model use the well - known dimer worm algorithm of ref .  .",
    "this allows us to straightforwardly obtain high - precision results for various dimer correlation functions even at large @xmath33 .",
    "our wavefunction simulations are however much more challenging , and require some new algorithmic developments .    in order to appreciate the algorithmic difficulties involved ,",
    "it is useful to start with the following key observation , which forms the basis of the analysis in ref .  :",
    "when overlap loops between bra and ket valence - bonds are on average rather small , as is the case in the spin - liquid phase , we may think of the corresponding loop - gas in terms of a picture consisting of densely - packed short loops . in the @xmath166 limit where all loops are the shortest possible , _",
    "i.e. _ doubled - edges , we may thus caricature the system by thinking in terms of a fully - packed dimer model where the dimers now correspond to doubled edges .",
    "if this large-@xmath5 caricature of the system provides a good approximation to long - distance properties of correlations in the nnrvb wavefunction , bra and ket valence - bonds must necessarily be tied to each other quite strongly .",
    "this has important implications for the efficiency of the standard sandvik - evertz algorithm@xcite . to see this",
    ", we recall that this algorithm , when applied to wavefunction studies , consists of two steps : in the first step , one updates the bra ( ket ) valence - bond configuration using a dimer worm algorithm@xcite , while keeping the ket ( bra ) configuration and the auxillary spin - states@xcite fixed . in the second step ,",
    "one updates the spin - states along randomly chosen overlap loops .",
    "when one performs a dimer worm update@xcite on either the bra valence - bond configuration or the ket valence - bond configuration , the worm construction has to respect the constraints provided by the background auxillary spin - configuration , which remains static . as a result , most worms grown by the dimer worm algorithm are extremely small , and it is impossible to change the bra or the ket valence - bond configuration except very slowly .",
    "this leads to serious equilibriation problems that affect the accuracy of measurements of bond - energy correlations and winding sector probabilities in the nnrvb wavefunction simulations for large @xmath33 and @xmath5@xcite .",
    "the solution@xcite to these algorithmic difficulties suggests itself immediately if one thinks in terms of this large-@xmath5 caricature for the short - loop phase : motivated by this caricature , one introduces an additional update scheme , whereby a worm algorithm is used to simultaneously move the bra and ket valence - bonds that comprise doubled - edges in the loop representation .",
    "in other words , one considers the sub - system made up of bra and ket valence - bonds that cover the same link of the honeycomb lattice , _ i.e. _ the part of the lattice which is covered by doubled - edges .",
    "this subsystem is updated using a standard worm algorithm@xcite applied to the doubled - edges . in doing so , other valence - bonds , that form part of non - trivial overlap loops of length greater than two , are held fixed .",
    "the spin configuration on sites visited by such nontrivial loops is also held fixed .",
    "however , the spin labels on sites touched by doubled - edges are updated during the construction of the worm using the following prescription : if the worm construction starts with a @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) sublattice site , spin - states of all @xmath29 ( @xmath28 ) sublattice sites encountered in the worm construction are left unchanged , while spin - states of all @xmath28 ( @xmath29)sublattice sites encountered in the worm construction are made consistent with the spin - state of the @xmath29 ( @xmath28 ) sublattice site to which they are connected by a doubled - edge in the final valence - bond configuration ( after the worm has updated that part of the lattice ) .",
    "this additional update scheme greatly improves the ergodicity of our simulations .",
    "we have tested it thoroughly in the present case and confirmed that results on small systems are identical to those obtained using the conventional sandvik - evertz algorithm . at large sizes and large @xmath5",
    ", this additional update provides us a way of obtaining accurate results for bond - energy correlations , and for the relative weight of different winding number sectors .",
