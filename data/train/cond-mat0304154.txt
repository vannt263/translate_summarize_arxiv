    "the critical behavior of three - dimensional frustrated spin models with noncollinear order has been the subject for intensive experimental and theoretical investigations , since they are expected to belong to a new universality class with unusual values of critical exponents @xcite . physically , noncollinear or canted order is a consequence of frustration due to either the special geometry of the lattice or the competition of different kinds of interactions .",
    "examples of the first kind are the three - dimensional stacked triangular antiferromagnets ( sta ) in which magnetic ions are located at each site of a stacked triangular lattice   ( e.g. csmnbr@xmath10 , vcl@xmath11 , vbr@xmath11 ) .",
    "the second case is represented by helimagnets like the rare - earth ho , dy , tb , in which magnetic spirals are formed along certain directions of the lattice .",
    "although monte carlo simulations @xcite and experimental studies @xcite apparently give contradicting results  ( supporting either a continuous phase transition with new critical exponents or a weak first order one ) , a quite definite description of the critical behavior has been reached in the fixed dimension @xmath12 field - theoretical ( ft ) approach  @xcite . in more detail , these and other relevant issues are reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where one can find a complete list of references ; we mention here only the very recent studies .",
    "field - theoretical investigations of such systems are based on the o@xmath13o@xmath14 symmetric landau - ginzburg - wilson hamiltonian   @xcite @xmath15   + { 1\\over 4!}u_0 \\left ( \\sum_a \\phi_a^2\\right)^2   + { 1\\over 4 ! }   v_0   \\sum_{a , b } \\left [ ( \\phi_a \\cdot \\phi_b)^2 - \\phi_a^2\\phi_b^2\\right ]               \\right\\},\\label{lgwh}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) are @xmath18 sets of @xmath0-component vectors .",
    "frustrated systems with noncollinear ordering are described by the hamiltonian ( [ lgwh ] ) with @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "negative values of @xmath21 correspond to simple ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic ordering and to magnets with sinusoidal spin structures @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath22 corresponds to frustrated antiferromagnets with nonplanar spin ordering @xcite .",
    "moreover , recently the hamiltonian ( [ lgwh ] ) has received a lot of attentions because it describes also the quantum critical behavior in some mott insulators @xcite .",
    "fixing @xmath19 , the physically relevant cases of frustrated xy and heisenberg models are described by the hamiltonian ( [ lgwh ] ) with @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively .",
    "field - theoretical studies in the framework of @xmath25 @xcite , @xmath7 @xcite , and @xmath26@xcite expansions as well as in fixed dimensions @xmath27 @xcite and @xmath28 @xcite reveal that the existence and the stability properties of the fixed points depend on @xmath0 and on the spatial dimensionality . within the @xmath6 expansion , for sufficiently large values of @xmath0 the renormalization group  ( rg ) equations possess four fixed points : the gaussian fixed point ( @xmath29 ) , the o@xmath30-symmetric ( @xmath31 ) one and two anisotropic fixed points located in the region @xmath32 and usually named chiral and antichiral .",
    "the chiral fixed point is the only stable one .",
    "there is a critical dimensionality @xmath33 where the chiral and antichiral fixed points coalesce and disappear for @xmath34 . in the last case , under the absence of any stable fixed point the system is expected to undergo a weak first - order phase transition , since the associated rg flows run away from the region of stability of the fourth - order form in the free - energy expansion .",
    "the three - loop estimate of @xmath33 obtained in the framework of the @xmath6 expansion technique is @xcite @xmath35 that , after an appropriate resummation , results in @xmath36 in three dimensions .",
    "this inequality leads to the conclusion that for the physical models with @xmath37 the three - dimensional chiral transition is first - order , as corroborated also by some other rg studies  @xcite . to the contrary , both for @xmath23 and @xmath24 the highest - order six - loop calculations in three dimensions @xcite reveal a strong evidence for a stable chiral fixed point that",
    ", however , is not related to its counterpart found earlier within the @xmath6 expansion .",
    "furthermore , in a recent work @xcite we claimed that both in two and three dimensions the experimentally controversial situation may reflect the quite unusual mode of critical behavior of the @xmath0-vector chiral model under the physical values of @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , it was shown that this critical behavior is governed by a stable fixed point which is a focus , attracting rg trajectories in a spiral - like manner .    for large enough @xmath0 all the field - theoretical methods",
    "are expected to be qualitatively and quantitatively correct .",
    "in fact , both @xmath6 and @xmath7 expansions lead to the same structure of flow diagram and the fixed points location and to identical critical exponents @xcite  ( see also the comparison between monte carlo data and the results of three - loop ft study made in ref .",
    "however , no analysis of the three - dimensional six - loop series  @xcite for general @xmath0 is still available .",
    "for this reason , we calculate here all the fixed points of hamiltonian ( [ lgwh ] ) for various @xmath0 and analyze the critical behavior characterized by the stable fixed point , computing also the chiral exponents on the base of known rg series @xcite ) .",
    "we show that the focus - driven critical behavior found previously for physical models in ref .",
    "@xcite ends , under increasing @xmath0 , at some @xmath38 .",
    "then a small zone of first order phase transition @xmath39 exists .",
    "finally , for @xmath40 the continuous transition recovers , being governed by a stable node that is generically related to the stable fixed point given by @xmath6 and @xmath7 expansions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we describe the method of our analysis . sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] contains all the results obtained along with their discussion . in sec .",
    "[ concl ] we present a summary and concluding remarks .",
    "we analyze the fixed dimensional ( @xmath28 ) perturbative six - loop series computed for general @xmath0 in refs .",
    "@xcite by the same methods applied for the xy and heisenberg frustrated models in refs .",
    "@xcite . within the fixed dimension approach  @xcite the perturbative series",
    "are obtained expanding the quantities of interest in powers of the quartic couplings and renormalizing the theory by introducing a set of zero - momentum conditions for two - point and four - point correlation functions @xcite .",
    "all perturbative series are expressed in terms of the renormalized couplings @xmath41 and @xmath42 , normalized so that at the tree level they are proportional to the bare ones .",
    "the fixed points of the theory are given by the common zeros of the @xmath43 functions defined as @xmath44 in the case of a continuous transition the coupling @xmath45 are driven toward an infrared - stable zero @xmath46 of the @xmath43 functions .",
    "the absence of a stable fixed point is usually considered as an indication of a first - order phase transition . the series for the critical exponents ( e.g. @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) are obtained considering the anomalous dimensions of two - point functions with the insertion of operator with the right symmetry ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we adopt here the symmetric rescaling of the coupling constants @xmath49 with @xmath50 to obtain , as in two dimensions @xcite , finite fixed point coordinates in the limit of infinite dimension of the order parameter ( @xmath51 ) . in the following we denote with @xmath52 and @xmath53 the @xmath54-functions corresponding to these rescaled couplings .",
    "the obtained rg series are asymptotic and some resummation procedure is needed in order to extract accurate numerical values for the physical quantities .",
    "exploiting the property of borel summability of @xmath55 theories in two and three dimensions , we resum the divergent asymptotic series by a borel transformation combined with a method for the analytic extension of the borel transform .",
    "this last procedure can be obtained by a pad extension or by a conformal mapping @xcite which maps the domain of analyticity of the borel transform ( cut at the instanton singularity ) onto a circle ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "the conformal mapping method takes advantage of the knowledge of the large order behavior of the perturbative series @xmath56  @xcite @xmath57   \\qquad { \\rm with}\\qquad a(z ) = - 1/\\ub_b(z ) , \\label{lobh}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the singularity of the borel transform closest to the origin at fixed @xmath59 , given by @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "moreover , it is known @xcite that for @xmath62 the borel transform has a singularity on the positive real axis , which , however , is not the closest one for @xmath63 .",
    "thus , for @xmath62 the series is not borel summable .    for each perturbative series @xmath64",
    ", we obtain the following approximants @xmath65^\\alpha } , \\label{approx}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 and the coefficients @xmath67 are determined by the condition that the expansion of @xmath68 in powers of @xmath69 and @xmath70 gives @xmath71 to order @xmath72 .    within the second resummation procedure ,",
    "the borel transform is analytically extended by means of a generalized pad - borel - leroy technique , using the resolvent series trick . explicitly , once introduced the resolvent series of the perturbative one @xmath64 @xmath73 which is a series in powers of @xmath74 with coefficients being uniform polynomials in @xmath75 , the analytical continuation of the borel transform is the pad approximant @xmath76 $ ] in @xmath74 at @xmath77 .",
    "obviously , the approximant for each perturbative series depends on the chosen pad approximant and on the parameter @xmath78 .    in order to evaluate the fixed point",
    "coordinates by the conformal mapping method , we resum the perturbative series for each @xmath79 function within the whole plane of coupling constants @xmath80 . for each @xmath79 function",
    "we choose 18 approximants which were found to be stable , for small @xmath81 and @xmath82 , under variation of the order of rg approximation ( number of loops ) , i. e. @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "we divide the domain @xmath85 , @xmath86 in @xmath87 rectangles and we mark all the sites in which at least two approximants for @xmath88 and @xmath89 vanish .",
    "analogously , with the pad approximants we take all of them with integer @xmath78 in the range @xmath90 $ ] and without dangerous poles ; in this case the statistics is much less significant due to a large number of defective approximants .",
    "located the fixed points , the next step is to find the stable one which drives the system to criticality .",
    "the stability properties of the fixed points are determined by the eigenvalues @xmath91 , @xmath92 of the @xmath93 matrix @xmath94 a stable fixed point must have two eigenvalues with positive real parts , while a fixed point possessing eigenvalues with non - vanishing imaginary parts is called focus .",
    "we calculate @xmath91 and @xmath92 at a given fixed point considering the numerical derivatives of each pair of approximants of the two @xmath79-functions at their common zero ( there are 324 possible combinations with the conformal mapping method and 81 , minus defective ones , with the pad approximant technique ) . to obtain reliable numerical estimates for @xmath91 and @xmath92 , we limit ourselves by the approximants which yield the fixed point coordinates compatible with their final , properly weighted values .    the critical exponents are finally evaluated at the stable fixed point by means of employing of the approximants which minimize the difference between the estimates given by different perturbative orders  ( see e.g. @xcite for details ) .",
    "in this section we analyze the six - loop perturbative series of the rg functions for large number of components of the order parameter using the methods explained above . in fig.[alln ] we report our results for the zeros of the two @xmath79 functions for @xmath95 , and @xmath96 , obtained with the conformal mapping technique .",
    "it is seen from this figure that two branches of zeros of @xmath52 exist for all the considered values of @xmath0 .",
    "these branches become closer to each other with decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "the zeros of @xmath53 are represented by a curve which clearly intersects the upper branch of @xmath52 for @xmath97 and the lower branch for @xmath98 . in the complement of these regions ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath99 and close vicinity of this value , the presence or the absence of fixed points is less evident from fig.[alln ] . however , looking at the single pair of approximants for two @xmath79 functions , one can find that for all @xmath100 the majority of the approximants for @xmath52 gives rise to two branches of zeros separated in the plane @xmath101 .",
    "for each pair of approximants we find that two marginal values of @xmath0 , @xmath102 and @xmath38 , exist .",
    "for @xmath40 the chiral and the antichiral fixed points are always present .",
    "they are located on the lower branch of @xmath52 and coalesce for @xmath103 . for @xmath39 only the unstable  gaussian and o@xmath30-symmetric ( heisenberg )  fixed points exist , while for @xmath104 the chiral and the antichiral fixed points appear again , being located , however , on the upper branch of @xmath52 . with the precision of our calculation we can state that @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "let us now discuss the critical behavior in these three domains of @xmath0 .",
    "for @xmath107 there are four fixed points : chiral , antichiral , heisenberg and gaussian .",
    "the location ( reported in table  [ tabfp ] ) and the stability analysis  ( see table  [ tabellone2 ] ) of these fixed points reveal that the chiral one is a stable node and governs the critical regime , while the heisenberg and the antichiral are unstable with one negative eigenvalue of the @xmath93 matrix  ( cf .",
    "table  [ tabellone2 ] ) .",
    "the critical exponents that characterize the second order phase transition are reported in tab .",
    "[ tabellone2 ] with the data of the large @xmath0 analysis   @xcite .",
    "the results indicate that there is a reasonable agreement between the two perturbative methods .",
    "it implies that this domain of @xmath0 is generically related to those accessible in the framework of the @xmath7 and @xmath6 expansions .",
    "so , we can conclude that @xmath102 is nothing but a marginal value of @xmath0 introduced earlier within various approximations ( @xmath108 of refs .",
    "@xcite , @xmath109 of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath110 of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath33 of ref .",
    "@xcite , and @xmath111 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    .",
    "location of the chiral and antichiral fixed point as function of @xmath0 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tabellone ]",
    "in this work , we have studied the critical thermodynamics of the o@xmath112o@xmath113 spin model for number of components of the order parameter @xmath0 greater than @xmath114 on the base of the six - loop rg series  @xcite , giving a complete description of the evolution of critical behavior under varying @xmath0 .",
    "we have found that for @xmath115 the transition is continuous and governed by a stable chiral fixed point , that is generically related to the stable fixed point found earlier within the @xmath6 expansion and @xmath7 expansion analyses . for @xmath39  with @xmath116",
    "we have not detected any stable fixed point and the chiral transition is expected to be first order .",
    "the focus - like critical behavior , found previously for physical models ( @xmath117 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , has been confirmed to exist for any @xmath118 . in this region of @xmath0 , the character of crossover phenomena may be rather complicated leading to effective exponents which vary in a non - monotonic way . in analogy with dilute ising systems , where the concentration - dependent critical exponents seem to violate the universality because of crossover effects near criticality  @xcite , it looks plausible that the results of some simulations  @xcite and experiments  @xcite , which yield negative values for the exponent @xmath119 , reflect the peculiarities of the preasymptotic regimes .    being the region @xmath40 connected with that accessible by the large @xmath0 analysis , we expect that @xmath102 coincides with @xmath33 usually introduced in @xmath6 and @xmath7 expansions .",
    "several estimates for @xmath33 exist . to quote the more recent ones , we have @xmath120 @xcite and @xmath121 @xcite from 3-loop @xmath6 expansion , @xmath122 from the exact renormalization group approach @xcite , and @xmath123 @xcite and @xmath124 @xcite from @xmath7 expansion .",
    "these scattered results clearly indicate that the extrapolation of @xmath7 and @xmath6 expansion predictions up to the physical values of @xmath0 and @xmath6 is a quite delicate matter .",
    "to conclude , we believe that working with the highest - order , six - loop rg series and processing them by means of the advanced resummation techniques , we obtain a clear and definite understanding of the critical behavior of @xmath0-vector chiral model for all the integer values of @xmath0 , including the physically relevant ones .",
