    "the remarkable spin - orbit splitting for the spin doublets ( @xmath2 ) , i.e. , the spin symmetry ( ss ) breaking , is one of the most important concepts for understanding the traditional magic numbers 2 , 8 , 20 , 28 , 50 , and 82 for both protons and neutrons as well as 126 for neutrons in stable nuclei @xcite .",
    "since these magic numbers are not simply the shell closure of the harmonic oscillators , it is quite sophisticated to predict the next proton and neutron magic numbers @xcite , which are critical for guiding the superheavy element synthesis .",
    "meanwhile , the so - called pseudospin symmetry ( pss ) @xcite was introduced in 1969 to explain the near degeneracy between two single - particle states with the quantum numbers ( @xmath3 ) and ( @xmath4 ) by defining the pseudospin doublets ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "based on this concept , numerous phenomena in nuclear structure have been successfully interpreted , including superdeformation @xcite , identical bands @xcite , and pseudospin partner bands @xcite , etc",
    ". it will be quite interesting and challenging to understand the shell closure and the pseudospin symmetry on the same footing , in particular for superheavy and exotic nuclei near the limit of nucleus existence .    during the past decades , more and",
    "more exotic nuclei have became accessible with worldwide new generation radioactive ion beam ( rib ) facilities .",
    "it has been shown that the traditional magic numbers can change in the nuclei far away from the stability line  @xcite .",
    "the splittings of both spin and pseudospin doublets play critical roles in the shell structure evolutions , for example , the @xmath6 shell closure disappears due to the quenching of the spin - orbit splitting for the @xmath7 spin doublets  @xcite , the @xmath8 sub - shell closure is closely related to the restoration of pss for the @xmath9 and @xmath10 pseudospin doublets  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is a fundamental task to explore the origin of ss and pss , as well as the mechanism of their breaking in both stable and exotic nuclei .    since the suggestion of pss in atomic nuclei , there have been comprehensive efforts to understand its origin . apart from the formal relabeling of quantum numbers as shown above , various explicit transformations from the normal scheme to the pseudospin scheme have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "based on the single - particle hamiltonian of the oscillator shell model , the origin of pss is connected with the special ratio in the strengths of the spin - orbit and orbit - orbit interactions  @xcite .",
    "the relation between the pss and the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) theory  @xcite was first noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the rmf theory explains approximately such special ratio in the strength of the spin - orbit and orbit - orbit interactions .    as substantial progress",
    ", the pss was shown to be a symmetry of the dirac hamiltonian , where the pseudo - orbital angular momentum @xmath11 is nothing but the orbital angular momentum of the lower component of the dirac spinor @xcite .",
    "in addition , the equality in magnitude but difference in sign of the scalar potential @xmath12 and vector potential @xmath13 was suggested as the exact pss limit by reducing the dirac equation to a schrdinger - like equation @xcite",
    ". a more general condition @xmath14 was proposed @xcite , which can be approximately satisfied in exotic nuclei with highly diffuse potentials @xcite . however , since there exist no bound nuclei within such pss limit , the non - perturbative nature of pss in realistic nuclei has been suggested @xcite , which was also related to the consideration of the pss as a dynamical symmetry @xcite . in this sense , an explicit and quantitative connection between the ideal pss limits and the realistic nuclei is still missing .    after the pss was revealed as a relativistic symmetry , numerous efforts have been dedicated to tracing the relativistic origin of pss and its breaking mechanism in a quantitative way .",
    "these investigations include the one - dimensional woods - saxon potential @xcite , the spherical woods - saxon @xcite , coulomb @xcite , harmonic oscillator @xcite , anharmonic oscillator @xcite , hulthn @xcite , morse @xcite , rosen - morse @xcite , eckart @xcite , pschl - teller @xcite , diatomic molecular @xcite , manning - rosen @xcite , mie - type @xcite , and yukawa @xcite potentials , as well as the deformed harmonic oscillator @xcite , anharmonic oscillator @xcite , hartmann @xcite , kratzer @xcite , and makarov @xcite potentials , together with some formal studies @xcite .",
    "self - consistently , the pss in spherical @xcite and deformed @xcite nuclei have been investigated in the rmf and relativistic hartree - fock @xcite theories .",
    "the pss investigations were also extended to the single - particle resonances @xcite as well as the single - particle states in the dirac sea , i.e. , the ss in the anti - nucleon spectra @xcite and the @xmath15 spectra in hyper - nuclei @xcite .",
    "the relevances of the pss in nuclear magnetic moments and transitions @xcite as well as in nucleon - nucleus and nucleon - nucleon scatterings @xcite were discussed .",

    "@xcite for reviews .",
    "recently , in refs .",
    "@xcite , the perturbation theory was used to investigate the symmetries of the dirac hamiltonian and their breaking in realistic nuclei .",
    "this provides a clear way for investigating the perturbative nature of pss .",
    "it is found that the energy splitting of the pseudospin doublets can be regarded as a result of perturbation on the hamiltonian with relativistic harmonic oscillator potentials , where the pseudospin doublets are degenerate .",
    "the supersymmetric ( susy ) quantum mechanics was also used to investigate the symmetries of the dirac hamiltonian @xcite . in particular , by employing both exact and broken susy , the phenomenon that all states with @xmath16 have their own pseudospin partners except for the so - called intruder states can be interpreted naturally within a unified scheme .",
    "a pss breaking potential without singularity can also be obtained with the susy technique @xcite .",
    "in contrast , singularities appear in the reduction of the dirac equation to a schrdinger - like equation for the lower component of the dirac spinor . however , by reducing the dirac equation to a schrdinger - like equation for the upper component , the effective hamiltonian shown in ref .",
    "@xcite is not hermitian , since the upper component wave functions alone , as the solutions of the schrdinger - like equation , are not orthogonal to each other . in order to fulfill the orthonormality ,",
    "an additional differential relation between the lower and upper components must be taken into account .",
    "thus , effectively , the upper components alone are orthogonal with respect to a modified metric .",
    "this prevents us from being able to perform quantitative perturbation calculations .    a very recent work @xcite filled the gap between the perturbation calculations and the susy descriptions by using the similarity renormalization group ( srg ) technique to transform the dirac hamiltonian into a diagonal form .",
    "the effective hamiltonian expanded in a series of @xmath17 in the schrdinger - like equation thus obtained is hermitian .",
    "this makes the perturbation calculations possible .",
    "therefore , we deem it promising to understand the pss and its breaking mechanism in a fully quantitative way by combining the srg technique , susy quantum mechanics , and perturbation theory .    by using the srg technique ,",
    "a dirac equation can be transformed into a diagonal form in a series of @xmath17 , and its lowest - order approximation corresponds to a schrdinger equation . by taking this lowest - order approximation as an example , the idea for applying the susy quantum mechanics to trace the origin of the pss will be illustrated and the pss breaking mechanism will be explored quantitatively by the perturbation theory in this paper . in sec .",

    "this corresponds to the lowest - order approximation for transforming a dirac equation into a diagonal form by using the similarity renormalization group ( srg ) technique .    within the single - particle hamiltonian @xmath0 representation ,",
    "the wave functions of pseudospin doublets are very different from each other , and the small pseudospin - orbit ( pso ) splittings @xmath136 are due to the sophisticated cancellations among all channels",
    ". however , this does not necessarily mean the dynamical or even the nonperturbative nature of pss . by taking the hamiltonian with a harmonic oscillator ( ho ) potential @xmath162 as the exact pss limit",
    ", it is found that the largest perturbation correction due to the symmetry breaking term @xmath163 is roughly 0.13 , and @xmath136 can be well reproduced by the third - order perturbation calculations .",
    "the origin of the pss and its breaking mechanism can be interpreted explicitly within the representation of the susy partner hamiltonian @xmath1 . in order to obtain @xmath1 ,",
    "one first solves the first - order differential equation for the reduced superpotentials @xmath82 , and then one obtains the @xmath88-dependent central potentials @xmath138 in @xmath1 .",
    "it is important that the central potentials are regular and converge at both @xmath94 and @xmath150 .",
    "consequently , the eigenstates of hamiltonians @xmath0 and @xmath1 are exactly one - to - one identical , except for the additional eigenstates in @xmath0 when the susy is exact , which correspond to the intruder states without pseudospin partners .    by holding this one - to - one mapping relation ,",
    "the origin of pss deeply hidden in @xmath0 can be traced by employing its susy partner hamiltonian @xmath1 . within this susy partner scheme ,",
    "the wave functions of the pseudospin doublets are almost identical , and the well known node relation between the pseudospin doublets , i.e. , @xmath164 for @xmath89 and @xmath165 for @xmath93 , is one of the intrinsic properties of the susy quantum mechanics .",
    "it is also found that the pso splittings @xmath136 are mainly contributed by the pss breaking terms .",
    "this indicates the sophisticated cancellations among different terms in @xmath0 can be understood in a clear scheme by using a proper decomposition .    the hamiltonian @xmath1 is then split into the pss conserving term @xmath144 and the pss breaking term @xmath145 .",
    "while the pss conserving potentials @xmath147 remain an approximate woods - saxon shape with a slight @xmath88-dependence , the pss breaking potentials @xmath140 show several special features .",
    "1 ) the potentials @xmath140 are regular functions of @xmath79 , and they vanish at both @xmath94 and @xmath150 .",
    "2 ) the amplitudes of @xmath151 are around 1  mev , which directly lead to the reduced pso splittings @xmath152  mev .",
    "3 ) the potentials @xmath140 show a particular shape of being negative at small radius but positive at large radius , with a node at the surface region . the general pattern that the pso splittings become smaller with increasing single - particle energies , and",
    "even reverse for resonance states , can be understood straightforwardly by such particular symmetry - breaking potentials .",
    "finally , the perturbation calculations are performed based on the pss conserving hamiltonian @xmath144 with the perturbation @xmath145 .",
    "it is found that in such decomposition the largest perturbation correction due to the symmetry breaking term @xmath145 is less than 0.03 , and not only the pso splittings but also the energy degeneracy of the spin doublets are excellently reproduced by the first - order perturbation calculations .",
    "in such a way , the origin of the pss can be recognized , and its breaking is due to a very small perturbation @xmath145 on the exact pss limit @xmath144 .    in short ,",
    "the justification for using susy quantum mechanics is that the partner hamiltonian shares its eigenvalues with the original one , while the pss conserving term proportional to @xmath58 can be naturally identified .",
    "furthermore , the pss breaking term is responsible for the observed pss splitting .",
    "the amplitudes of @xmath166 quantitatively determine the amplitudes of the reduced pso splittings @xmath136 .",
    "the particular shape of @xmath167 can also explain the decrease of the pso splitting with increasing single - particle energies .",
    "the present investigation employs a schrdinger equation for illustrating the key ideas on applying the susy quantum mechanics to the pss in nuclei .",
    "since the spin - orbit term , which appears as a second - order correction in @xmath17 , is crucial for the nuclear shell structure , it is important to investigate its effects on the properties of the susy quantum mechanics and pss in a quantitative way . in order to completely answer the question of why the pss is conserved better than the ss in realistic nuclei ,",
    "the intrinsic relation between the spin - orbit potential and the central potential or the effective mass must be taken into account . in this sense",
    ", the pss must be regarded as the relativistic symmetry , and it should be recognized in the dirac equation , or equivalently the schrdinger - like equation obtained by transforming the dirac equation into a diagonal form by using the srg technique .",
