    "nuclear beta decay has played a crucial role in the development of the weak interaction theory .",
    "three experimental foundations of the standard electroweak model , _",
    "i.e. _ _ ( i ) _ the assumption of maximal parity violation ; _ ( ii ) _ the assumption of massless neutrinos ; and _ ( iii ) _ the vector axial - vector character of the weak interaction have their sources in the detailed analysis of nuclear beta decay processes . the so - called _",
    "universal v - a _ theory has been established from the analogy between nuclear beta decay and muon decay .",
    "the ensuing confrontation of the weak interaction theory , constructed at low energies , against the results obtained at higher energies , motivated the development of a gauge theory and constituted a significant step which led to the construction of the unified electroweak model .",
    "the beta decay theory , including some of its refinements like the induced weak currents , has been firmly established and tested more than three decades ago and has later been embedded into the wider framework of the standard electroweak model . since",
    "then the main motivations of new experiments performed at low energies , with ever increased statistical accuracy , have been to provide precision tests of the discrete symmetries as well as to address specific questions involving the light quarks , which are naturally best studied in nuclear and neutron decays .    nuclear beta decay is a semi - leptonic strangeness - conserving process which , at the fundamental level and to lowest order , involves the lightest leptons ( @xmath1,@xmath2 ) and quarks ( @xmath3,@xmath4 ) interacting via the exchange of the charged vector bosons @xmath5 . the number of constraints on the standard model provided by these low energy experiments is actually limited as is also the number of relevant standard model parameters involved in the description of the semi - leptonic beta decay . in this sense",
    "the _ tests of the standard model _ considered at low energies generally refer to the tests of the underlying fundamental symmetries rather than to tests of the consistency of the theory or the predictions of new phenomena .",
    "the main aim of precision low energy experiments is to find deviations from the standard model assumptions as possible indications of new physics .",
    "despite the great success of the standard model , many open questions remain such as the hierarchy of fermion masses , the number of generations , the origin of parity violation , the mechanism behind cp violation , the number of parameters of the theory , etc .",
    "these are expected to find explanations in extended and unified theoretical frameworks involving new physics .",
    "the production of intense sources and beams of @xmath6 emitters ( nuclei and neutrons ) , with high purity and possibly polarized , enables a high statistical accuracy to be reached in the determination of the parameters which describe the weak interaction in nuclei and in the searches for deviations from maximal parity violation or from time reversal invariance .",
    "in addition , the rich spectra of nuclear states and the combination with transitions involving other emitted particles ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) following the beta decay transition , offer a large diversity to the design of low energy experiments and to implement different techniques .",
    "for well selected transitions the uncertainties associated with hadronic effects can be well controlled such that their impact remains below the experimental accuracy and does not affect the extraction of reliable results .    the role of beta decay experiments to test the standard model assumptions and to look for new physics has been discussed earlier in several papers @xcite with emphasis on specific aspects of this sector .",
    "we have heavily relied on these works to prepare the present review and we invite the reader to consult them for more details .",
    "this review discusses nuclear beta decay within the framework of the standard model and beyond , with emphasis on the sensitivity of experiments looking for new physics .",

    "the elaboration of the weak interaction theory has been retraced in many books and reviews .",
    "the most relevant original publications have been summarized and analyzed in different contexts @xcite .",
    "several classical texts @xcite introduce the theory with appropriate references to the early experiments and provide also the basics of the phenomenological description of nuclear beta decay .",
    "more recent texts @xcite place nuclear beta decay in the context of the unified electroweak theory .",
    "the beta transitions are traditionally divided into _ allowed _ and _ forbidden_. allowed transitions correspond to processes in which no orbital angular momentum is carried away by the pair of leptons .",
    "their selection rules are :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) designate the spin and parity of the initial ( final ) state .",
    "the allowed transitions can then be subdivided into singlet and triplet components depending on whether the lepton spins are anti - parallel ( @xmath15 ) or parallel ( @xmath16 ) . in allowed transitions",
    "the singlet state can only arise when @xmath17 ( fermi selection rule ) whereas the triplet state corresponds to @xmath18 ( gamow - teller selection rule ) . in this last case ,",
    "transitions between states of zero angular momentum ( @xmath19 ) are excluded since it is impossible to generate a triplet state for @xmath20 .",
    "the electroweak interaction is described by the standard model @xcite .",
    "the symmetries of the underlying @xmath21 gauge group determine the properties of the interaction and generate the intermediate vector bosons .",

    "-decay at the quark - lepton level , mediated by the exchange of a weak boson . ]",
    "in low - energy processes like @xmath6-decay , in which the typical energies involved in the process are much smaller than the mass of the weak bosons , the interaction can be described by a four - fermion contact interaction .",
    "such formulation was first introduced with a vector interaction @xcite , it was later extended @xcite to describe transitions which required the introduction of other possible lorentz invariants and it was finally generalized @xcite as a universal formulation of the weak interaction , incorporating the assumption of maximal parity violation .",
    "the hamiltonian of the _ v - a theory _ resulting from such a four - fermion contact interaction has the form of a current - current interaction    @xmath23    where @xmath24  gev@xmath25 is the fermi coupling and the current @xmath26 contains a hadronic and a leptonic contribution    @xmath27    the fact that the fermi coupling has the dimension of ( mass)@xmath25 indicates that it can not correspond to a fundamental interaction strength whose value should not depend on a specific system of units . if @xmath28 designates the coupling strength between the weak boson and the fermions at each vertex of fig .",

    "the weak eigenstates of the quarks with charge @xmath31 are postulated to differ from the eigenstates of the electromagnetic and strong interaction , which define the mass eigenstates . in the case of the three quark families",
    "the mixing is expressed by means of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix  @xcite    @xmath32    here the primes denote the weak eigenstates .",
    "the normalization of the states requires the ckm - matrix to be unitary . for the @xmath3- and @xmath4-quarks involved in nuclear @xmath6-decay , in which the heavier quarks do not contribute to lowest order , we have    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the cabibbo angle .",
    "the weak interaction of the quark @xmath35 introduces then the matrix element @xmath36 in the amplitude of the hadronic current .",
    "the most general interaction hamiltonian density describing nuclear @xmath6-decay , including all possible interaction types consistent with lorentz - invariance , is given by @xcite    @xmath37    with the tensor operator given by    @xmath38    the interacting fields are here associated to the nucleons and the leptons and the interactions are described by the five operators : the scalar @xmath39 , the vector @xmath40 , the tensor @xmath41 , the axial - vector @xmath42 , and the pseudo - scalar @xmath43 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath44 and @xmath45 which appear in the leptonic currents determine the relative amplitude of each interaction .",

    "time - reversal invariance holds if the @xmath44 and @xmath50 are all real up to an overall common phase and is violated if at least one of the couplings has an imaginary phase relative to the others .",

    "@xmath56rb ions from an isotope separator are transformed into atoms , using a zr catcher foil , and trapped into a first mot .",
    "the trapped atoms are then transferred with a laser push beam to a second mot where they are re - trapped and polarized by optical pumping . applying a rotating bias field with which the nuclear spin vector is aligned",
    "then permits to measure with a single detector the @xmath6 asymmetry parameter @xmath57 as a function of the @xmath6 particle energy and the angle between the @xmath6 particle and the nuclear spin vector .",
    "a precision at the 1% accuracy level is aimed at @xcite .    at",
    "leuven a new set - up to polarize nuclei using the method of low temperature nuclear orientation @xcite has recently become operational @xcite .",
    "the set - up includes a 17 t superconducting magnet and a si pin - diode particle detector operating at a temperature of about 10 k. the nuclei are embedded in a non - magnetic host lattice in order to avoid uncertainties related to the lattice position of the nuclei when hyperfine fields in magnetic host lattices are used to polarize nuclei . here too",
    "a precision below 1% is envisaged .",
    "finally , another type of @xmath6 asymmetry measurement to search for tensor currents is being prepared @xcite at the isolde facility , using the nicole low temperature nuclear orientation set - up .",
    "it is a relative measurement of the @xmath6 asymmetry parameter for two isotopes of a single element , one decaying via a @xmath58 transition the other via a @xmath59 transition .",
    "such relative measurements have a two times higher sensitivity to tensor currents compared to a single absolute measurement and , in addition , are less affected by systematic effects .",
    "it was recently shown @xcite that limits on induced pseudo - scalar interactions , which are strongly constrained by data on @xmath60 decay , imply limits on the underlying fundamental scalar interactions that are , in certain cases , up to an order of magnitude stronger than limits on scalar interactions from direct @xmath6 decay searches . however ,",
    "if the new physics responsible for the effective scalar interactions arises at the electroweak scale from the explicit exchange of new scalars , limits from direct @xmath6 decay searches are comparable to those from @xmath60 decay . depending on the underlying assumptions , the indirect limits from this decay",
    "can even be weaker than the @xmath6 decay limits , leaving the interest in searches for new scalar interactions in @xmath6 decay experiments undiminished .",
    "limits on scalar and tensor couplings are also obtained from @xmath61 and @xmath62 decays @xcite , and from the purely leptonic decay of the muon @xcite .",
    "it is to be noted that @xmath63-decay , muon decay and @xmath6 decay yield complementary information .",
    "recently , the pibeta collaboration has found a strong deficit of the branching ratio of the radiative decay of positive pions at rest in the high-@xmath64/low-@xmath65 kinematic region @xcite .",
    "the same anomaly was observed before in another experiment , although with less statistical significance @xcite .",
    "this deficit could be caused by an inadequacy of the present @xmath66 description of the radiative pion decay , along with the radiative corrections , or by a small admixture of new tensor interactions which may arise due to exchange of new spin one chiral bosons which interact anomalously with matter @xcite .",
    "this result clearly calls for further theoretical and experimental work .    finally , @xcite derived order of magnitude constraints @xmath67 10@xmath68 and @xmath69 10@xmath25 from the upper limit on the neutrino mass .",
    "these results are complementary to those from measurements of @xmath70 , which are sensitive to ( @xmath71 ) and ( @xmath72 ) and measurements of @xmath73 , which are sensitive to @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "whereas the violation of parity in the weak interaction was discovered almost 50 years ago @xcite , its origin is still today not understood .",
    "the most popular models explaining the seemingly maximal violation of parity in the weak interaction are so - called left - right symmetric models ( sec .",
    "[ sec : righthanded ] ) .",
    "constraints on right - handed currents from @xmath6 decay come from longitudinal positron polarization experiments with unpolarized nuclei @xcite , measurements of the longitudinal polarization of positrons emitted by polarized nuclei @xcite , experiments in neutron decay @xcite and the @xmath76 t values of the superallowed @xmath77 transitions @xcite .",
    "there is strong interest in more precise tests of maximal parity violation in nuclear @xmath6 decay as these would provide new constraints on models with exotic fermions , with leptoquark exchange or with contact interactions @xcite .",
    "the average @xmath76 t value for the superallowed @xmath77 pure fermi transitions provides a stringent constraint on the mixing angle @xmath78 between the left- and right - handed @xmath79 gauge bosons . in a model where right - handed currents are assumed ,",
    "one can write the @xmath76 t value as    @xmath80    using the previously cited value @xmath76 t = @xmath81  s @xcite and the values for @xmath82 and @xmath83 recommended by the particle data group @xcite , and requiring that @xmath84 satisfies unitarity , @xcite found @xmath85 .",
    "this value deviates by about @xmath86 from zero , the value that corresponds to maximal parity violation .",
    "however , when the above mentioned weighted average of the new values for @xmath87 obtained from measurements in @xmath63 decays is used ( @xmath88 @xmath89 ; sec .",
    "[ sec : status - unitarity ] ) , one has @xmath78 = 0.0006(7 ) .",
    "the mixing angle for the left- and right - handed gauge bosons is thus clearly limited to the milliradian region : @xmath90 ( 90 % c.l . ) .",
    "this is currently the strongest limit on @xmath78 from @xmath6 decay .",
    "parity violation in the weak interaction was first observed by measuring the asymmetry parameter @xmath57 in the ( @xmath91 ) @xmath59 decay of polarized @xmath92co nuclei  @xcite .",
    "twenty years later this experiment was repeated with a more advanced set - up where the nuclear polarization could be rotated using two crossed magnetic coils , yielding @xmath93  @xcite . using eq .",
    "( [ eqn : aparapprox_rhcgt ] ) the above result yields a lower limit of 245 gev / c@xmath94 ( 90% c.l . ) for the mass of a vector boson coupling to right - handed particles ( assuming @xmath95 ) .",
    "however , this result should be taken with some caution as long as the effect of recoil order corrections , like weak magnetism , has not been evaluated for this transition .    the problem with recoil corrections can be avoided by measuring the @xmath6 asymmetry parameter @xmath57 in the @xmath6 decay between analog states of @xmath96 mirror nuclei . due to the superallowed character of these mirror @xmath6 transitions nuclear structure dependent corrections are very small .",
    "a survey of the sensitivity of such experiments for the mixed transitions of @xmath96 mirror nuclei from @xmath97c up to @xmath98ti has indicated @xcite that for most transitions the required experimental precision is of the order of 0.5% in order to be sensitive to a right - handed boson mass of 300 gev/@xmath99 ( 90% c.l . ) .",
    "this requires a very precise determination of the degree of nuclear polarization . a way to overcome",
    "this difficulty of absolute measurements is to carry out relative measurements , comparing the asymmetry parameter for the mixed mirror @xmath6 transition to that of a pure gamow - teller transition from the same isotope .",
    "this is possible for several mirror nuclei , such as @xmath100na , @xmath101 mg , @xmath102p and @xmath103ar , and was demonstrated in the case of @xmath102p  @xcite and @xmath103ar @xcite . since all @xmath6 transitions have the same sensitivity to @xmath104 ( @xmath105 , with @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) the mass of the @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) boson ; see sec.[sec : righthanded ] ) independent of their fermi / gamow - teller character ( see eq .",

    "the early measurements of the longitudinal polarization , @xmath111 , of beta particles from unpolarized nuclei in pure fermi and pure gamow - teller transitions have reached a precision of a few percent @xcite . however , the uncertainties in the recoil order corrections in the decays of @xmath112p and @xmath92co used in those measurements , hamper the extraction of reliable conclusions on weak interaction properties .",
    "the only measurement free of this problem is that for the mixed transition in the decay of tritium which yielded @xmath113  @xcite .",
    "however , it has been pointed out previously @xcite that some additional concern regarding the accuracy of mott scattering polarimetry for very low electron energies @xcite may make the error estimate of this measurement optimistic .",
    "sub - percent sensitivity was reached only in relative measurements @xcite where the ratio of the longitudinal polarization in pure fermi and pure gamow - teller transitions was determined .",
    "this ratio is sensitive to the product @xmath114 @xmath115 all measurements performed so far have been carried out in @xmath58 transitions . in the first experiment  @xcite the positron polarization was determined using bhabha scattering .",

    "if both the @xmath6 asymmetry parameter @xmath57 and the @xmath265 correlation @xmath73 could be determined with a precision of 1% or better , this would permit to test the cvc hypothesis and to search independently for second - class currents .",
    "finally , the scalar form factor was extracted with high precision from the @xmath76 t value of the superallowed @xmath77 fermi transitions , yielding @xmath266 = -0.00005(130 ) @xcite .",
    "this form factor should vanish both because of cvc and because it is a second class term .",

    "they continue to be a powerful tool to test the underlying symmetries , to determine the structure in more detail and to search for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "progress in the development of a number of new and advanced experimental techniques , often combined with improved isotope yields , resulted in a series of new precision experiments in nuclear @xmath6-decay .",
    "these provided important new tests of parity violation and time reversal invariance , new constraints on scalar and tensor contributions , new experimental as well as theoretical results related to the @xmath36 element of the ckm quark mixing matrix , and more stringent direct limits on the neutrino mass .",
    "the development of more intense cold as well as ultra - cold neutron beams and of improved techniques for neutron polarization , polarimetry and detection led to a significant increase in precision for lifetime measurements and for different correlations in neutron beta decay .",
    "recent correlation experiments have mainly concentrated on improving the determination of the ratio between the axial - vector and the vector form factors , @xmath267 , for an alternative determination of @xmath36 in order to test the unitarity of the ckm matrix .",
    "stringent p - violation tests and tests of t - invariance were carried out as well .",
    "an important problem during the last decade has been the possible violation of unitarity of the ckm matrix .",
    "the value of @xmath36 deduced from the @xmath76t - values of superallowed pure fermi transitions has resulted for a long time in a 2 to 2.5@xmath268 deviation from unitarity when combined with the adopted value for the @xmath87 matrix element .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath76t - values are consistent at the @xmath269 level confirming the cvc hypothesis .",
    "a similar deviation from unitarity was reported in neutron decay , where nuclear structure effects are absent .",
    "the result combines the neutron lifetime with the @xmath6-asymmetry parameter .",
    "this has triggered new determinations of @xmath87 in kaon decay as well as a new analysis of existing hyperon beta decay data .",
    "all results obtained are consistent , leading to a new value for @xmath87 which resolves the long standing unitarity problem .",
    "additional experiments to confirm this new value are ongoing and planned while the form factor @xmath270 , which takes into account @xmath271 symmetry breaking , is addressed again . assuming the observed shift in the value of @xmath87 is genuine , the unitarity condition is validated for the first row of the ckm matrix and , in addition , the nuclear corrections are put on a solid basis . the very precise average @xmath76t - value for the superallowed transitions",
    "can now be used to test the understanding of isospin effects in nuclei at an unprecedented level of precision and to carry out detailed studies of the @xmath272-interaction near the @xmath273 line . in turn , the control of nuclear structure effects will permit further tests of the symmetries of the standard model and new searches for physics beyond .",
    "accurate determinations of @xmath274-values for superallowed transitions should therefore be pursued whenever possible .",
    "such determinations require the measurements of the half - life , the corresponding branching and the @xmath275-value of the transitions .",
    "mass measurements at the level of 10@xmath276 are required to determine these @xmath275-values .",
    "new measurements of the neutron lifetime and of the @xmath6-asymmetry parameter led to a significant improvement in the determination of the fundamental ratio @xmath277 . with currently ongoing developments further progress can be expected and it is important that this type of measurements be continued .",
    "significant progress was also made over the past decade in the search for possible scalar and tensor contributions to the weak interaction .",
    "new measurements of different correlations between the spins and momenta of the particles involved in @xmath6-decay resulted in improved limits on the couplings and masses of bosons which could generate phenomenological scalar and tensor interactions . under identical assumptions these indirect limits are often tighter than those obtained by direct searches in collider experiments .",
    "important contributions in the search for scalar currents were provided by the @xmath6-@xmath202 correlation experiments with @xmath112ar and @xmath278k . in the search for tensor currents",
    "the contribution of the polarization - asymmetry parameter measurement with @xmath133 in is important .",
    "a remarkable development in the field was the introduction of atom and ion traps .",
    "these tools have enabled new types of @xmath6-@xmath202 correlation and @xmath6-asymmetry measurements , free of scattering effects and with undisturbed nuclear recoils .",
    "recently , first results from an experiment with @xmath278k became available , while several other experiments are currently ongoing .",
    "using different experimental methods these @xmath265 correlation measurements reach the 0.5% precision level .",
    "future experiments could consider to improve this to the 0.1% level .",
    "this requires the production of clean and high intensity beams , a detailed understanding of systematic effects and the eventual inclusion of recoil order effects in the data analysis .",
    "new experimental methods which do not use traps are also being developed .",
    "these new approaches avoid or at least significantly reduce a number of systematic effects .",
    "the new experiments will focus on relative measurements of the @xmath6 asymmetry parameter , on @xmath6 asymmetry measurements in a 17 t external magnetic field with polarized nuclei , and on the determination of the @xmath6-@xmath202 correlation in neutron decay with a retardation spectrometer .",
    "a precision of 0.5% to 1% is anticipated .    in the last decade",
    "significant progress was also made to test the discrete symmetries of parity and time reversal .",
    "the first measurements of the polarization - asymmetry correlation , carried out with @xmath133 in and with @xmath137n , yielded the most precise tests of parity violation in nuclear @xmath6 decay to date .",
    "a similar precision was obtained in a measurement of the neutrino asymmetry parameter @xmath150 in neutron decay .",
    "there is strong interest in more precise tests of parity violation in nuclear @xmath6 decays as these provide stringent constraints on several new extensions of the standard model .",
    "any measurement reaching the level of 500gev / c@xmath94 for a possible @xmath79 boson with right - handed couplings would be very valuable .",
    "new techniques should be developed to improve both the yields of the isotopes of interest for such measurements as well as the nuclear polarization .",
    "important progress in the search for deviations from maximal parity violation can be expected from new measurements of the neutron lifetime , and the @xmath6 asymmetry as well as the neutrino asymmetry in neutron decay .",
    "this is due to recent improvements in the techniques to polarize neutrons and to accurately determine this polarization , and to the development of techniques to keep the neutrons in the measurement volume for a time of the order of their lifetime .    from the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry in the universe",
    "it appears that there should be a new mechanism of time reversal violation in addition to the observed cp - violation that is incorporated in the standard model .",
    "new t - violation searches should therefore be pursued vigorously .",
    "for the triple correlations there are several orders of magnitude between the current experimental level of sensitivity and the manifestation of a standard model cp - violating effect and there is therefore a wide window available to search for new t - violating mechanisms .",
    "any system is good for such measurements , provided the final state interactions are well under control .",
    "the determination of the @xmath170 triple correlation in the decay of @xmath191li has yielded very stringent limits on the presence of t - violating tensor couplings .",
    "an ongoing experiment to measure for the first time the @xmath170 correlation in neutron decay will search for a t - violating scalar component",
    ". two new measurements of the @xmath165 triple correlation in neutron decay provided new tests of time reversal invariance in the vector and axial - vector parts of the weak interaction .",
    "the present results will further be improved in the second phase of both experiments which will potentially reach the 10@xmath279 sensitivity level .",
    "tests for the presence of second class currents , such as in the @xmath280 system , should be continued and improved .",
    "in addition , better tests of the strong cvc , which was so far tested at the 5% level , should be pursued too .",
    "finally , the efforts to directly determine the electron neutrino mass from a precision measurement of the tritium @xmath6 spectrum shape near the endpoint have been pursued in recent years by two very precise experiments with retardation spectrometers .",
    "both experiments have now reached their limits of sensitivity and have yielded the most stringent direct upper limits on the mass of the electron neutrino .",
    "based on the experience gained with these set - ups a new facility is now being developed which will be sensitive to a neutrino mass at the 0.3ev level .    in conclusion ,",
    "the past two decades have witnessed significant progress in the study of fundamental properties of the weak interaction in both nuclear and neutron @xmath6-decay .",
    "many efforts to further improve the sensitivity for this type of experiments are either ongoing or planned . in the years to come , experiments at low energy will thus continue to contribute to the study of weak interaction properties , providing information that is complementary to experiments in muon decay , at colliders or in underground neutrino laboratories .",
