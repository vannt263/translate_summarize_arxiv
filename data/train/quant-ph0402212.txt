    "the introduction of _ quantum marking _ and _ erasure _ by scully and drhl @xcite in 1982 opened the possibility to discuss some of the most relevant and subtle aspects of quantum measurement . indeed , since the foundation of quantum mechanics , one is well aware of the crucial role played by measurement devices ; a role which , occasionally , is even extended to conscious observers , as in the well known proposal by wigner .",
    "quantum marking and erasure are useful tools to investigate these basic issues . up to now",
    ", experimental tests of quantum erasure have been performed with atom interferometers @xcite and entangled photon pairs produced via spontaneous parametric down  conversion ( spdc ) @xcite .",
    "the general purpose of the present paper is to extend these quantum eraser considerations to entangled massive particles , i.e. , @xmath0 pairs produced in @xmath1resonance decays @xcite or proton  antiproton annihilations at rest @xcite .",
    "the basic idea behind quantum marking and erasure is that two indistinguishable and thus potentially interfering amplitudes of a quantum system , the _ object _ , can be made distinguishable thanks to the _ entanglement _ between the object and a second quantum system , the _ meter _ , which thus carries a kind of quantum _",
    "mark_. in ordinary two  path interferometric devices , the latter , marked system is frequently called a `` which way '' detector .",
    "if the information stored in the `` which way '' detector is even in principle accessible , the object system looses all its previous interference abilities .",
    "however , if one somehow manages to `` erase '' the meter mark and thus the distinguishability of the object amplitudes , the original object interference effects can be restored .",
    "this is achieved by correlating the outcomes of the measurements on the object system with those of suitable erasing measurements on the meter system .",
    "the case in which the meter is a system distinct and spatially separated from the object is of particular interest . indeed , in this case",
    "the decision to erase or not the meter mark and the distinguishability of the object amplitudes and therefore to observe or not interference can be taken long after the measurement on the object system has been completed .",
    "quantum erasure is then performed in the so called _ delayed choice _ mode which best captures the essence and most subtle aspects of this phenomenon @xcite .",
    "this mode of quantum erasure can be applied to entangled @xmath0 pairs as well as to spdc photon pairs , but , specific of the kaon case is the possibility that the erasure operation can be carried out via two distinct procedures : either _ actively _ , i.e. , by exerting the free will of the experimenter , or _ passively _ ,",
    "i.e. , randomly exploiting a particular quantum  mechanical property of the meter system .",
    "this opens new possibilities for quantum erasure with kaons .",
    "the first specific purpose of this paper is to discuss the existence of these two different active and passive quantum erasure procedures for neutral kaons . a second",
    ", twofold purpose is to show both the simplicity of the _ delayed choice _ mode of quantum erasure and its extension to _ passive _ measurements when operated with neutral kaons .",
    "these kaons turn out to be most suitable for achieving these two purposes .",
    "contrary to what happens with other two  level quantum systems such as spin@xmath2 particles or photons , neutral kaons only exhibit two different measurement bases @xcite : the strangeness and the lifetime bases .    the strangeness basis , @xmath3 with @xmath4 , is the appropriate one to discuss strong production and reactions of kaons .",
    "if a dense piece of nucleonic matter is inserted along a neutral kaon beam , the incoming state is projected either into a @xmath5 by the strangeness conserving strong interaction @xmath6 or into a @xmath7 via @xmath8 , @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "these strangeness detections are totally analogous to the projective von neumann measurements of two  channel analyzers for polarized photons or stern ",
    "gerlach setups for spin@xmath2 particles . by inserting the piece of matter along a kaon beam ,",
    "one induces an _ active _ measurement of strangeness .",
    "the strangeness content of neutral kaon states can be alternatively determined by observing their semileptonic decay modes .",
    "indeed , these semileptonic decays obey the well tested @xmath11 rule which allows the modes @xmath12 where @xmath13 stands for @xmath14 or @xmath15 , but forbids decays into the respective charge conjugated modes .",
    "obviously , the experimenter can not induce a kaon to decay semileptonically and not even at a given time : he or she can only sort at the end of the day all observed events in proper decay modes and time intervals .",
    "we call this discrimination between @xmath5 and @xmath7 via the identification of the kaon semileptonic decay modes a _ passive _ measurement of strangeness .",
    "the detection efficiency for both _ active _ and _ passive _ strangeness measurements is rather limited . in the former case ,",
    "the detection efficiency is close to @xmath16 only for ultrarelativistic kaons ; indeed , by lorentz contraction the piece of matter is seen by the incoming kaon as extremely dense and kaon  nucleon strong interactions become much more likely than kaon weak decays . in the case of",
    "_ passive _ strangeness detection , the efficiency is given by the @xmath17 and @xmath18 semileptonic branching ratios , which are @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "these limited detection efficiencies , which originate a serious problem @xcite when discussing bell  type tests for entangled kaons @xcite , do not introduce any conceptual difficulty here .",
    "they simply represent a practical difficulty in obtaining large statistical samples .    the second basis , the lifetime basis @xmath21 , consists of the short and long  lived states having well defined masses @xmath22 and decay widths @xmath23 .",
    "it is the appropriate basis to discuss free space propagation , with : @xmath24 .",
    "these states preserve their own identity in time , but , since @xmath25 @xcite , the @xmath18 component of a neutral kaon extincts much faster than the @xmath17 component . to observe if a kaon is propagating as a @xmath18 or @xmath17 at ( proper ) time @xmath26 , one has to identify at which time it subsequently decays .",
    "kaons which show a prompt decay , i.e. , a decay between @xmath26 and @xmath27 , have to be identified as @xmath18 s , while those decaying later than @xmath27 have to be identified as @xmath17 s .",
    "the probabilities for wrong @xmath18 or @xmath17 identification are then given by @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively . with @xmath30 , both @xmath18 and @xmath17",
    "misidentification probabilities are equal and reduce to @xmath31% @xcite .",
    "such a procedure , in which the experimenter chooses to allow for free space propagation , represents an _ active _ measurement of lifetime .    since four decades",
    "one knows that the neutral kaon system violates @xmath32 symmetry . among other things",
    ", this implies that the weak interaction eigenstates are not strictly orthogonal to each other , @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "however , by neglecting these small @xmath32 violation effects one can discriminate between @xmath18 s and @xmath17 s by leaving the kaons to propagate in free space and observing their distinctive nonleptonic @xmath34 or @xmath35 decay modes .",
    "this represents a _ passive _ measurement of lifetime , since the type of kaon decay modes nonleptonic in the present case , instead of semileptonic as before can not be in any way influenced by the experimenter .",
    "the measurement procedure is determined by the quantum dynamics of kaon decays",
    ".    summarizing , we have two conceptually different experimental procedures _active _ and _ passive_ to measure each one of the only two neutral kaon observables : strangeness or lifetime .",
    "the _ active _ measurement of strangeness is monitored by strangeness conservation while the corresponding _ passive _ measurement is assured by the @xmath36 rule .",
    "_ active _ and _ passive _ lifetime measurements are efficient thanks to the smallness of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "the existence of these two procedures is of no interest when testing bell inequalities with kaons , where _ active _ measurements must be considered @xcite .",
    "however , it opens new possibilities for kaonic quantum erasure experiments which have no analog for any other two  level quantum system considered up to date .",
    "let us start discussing the time evolution of a single neutral kaon which is initially produced ( say ) as a @xmath5 .",
    "just after production , at @xmath39 , it is described by the equal superposition of the two lifetime eigenstates , @xmath40 , and , according to eq .",
    "( [ timeevolution ] ) , it starts propagating in free space in the coherent superposition : @xmath41    note that the state @xmath42 evolves through a single spatial trajectory comprising _ automatically _ i.e . , with no need of any kind of double  slit apparatus the two differently propagating components @xmath18 and @xmath17 .",
    "this generates the well known strangeness or @xmath5@xmath7 oscillations .",
    "note also that , since @xmath43 , these two components are _ intrinsically _ marked by their remarkably distinct decay widths . at @xmath39",
    "this lifetime mark is inoperative and there is no information on which component is actually propagating ; @xmath18@xmath17 interference and thus @xmath5@xmath7 oscillations are maximal around @xmath39 .",
    "however , for kaons surviving after some time @xmath26 , @xmath18 propagation is known to be less likely than @xmath17 and partial `` which width '' information is obtained ; interference and oscillation phenomena are thus diminished .",
    "this happens in the same way as when one obtains `` which way '' information in two  path interferometric devices , as recently discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite in terms of quantitative complementarity .",
    "this dedicated analysis shows that a variety of double  slit experiments with photons or neutrons , as well as mott scattering experiments with identical nuclei , admit the very same description as the present oscillations of the neutral kaon system .",
    "but two advantages of the latter system are obvious : it does not need any kind of double  slit device nor any marking procedure ; indeed , both features are inherently supplied by nature .",
    "_ active _ and _ passive _ measurements of strangeness or lifetime on single kaon states evolving , for instance , as in eq .",

    "equivalently , object  meter ) symmetric , and ( ii ) time is not only the characteristic parameter distinguishing the two operation modes but also the variable in terms of which strangeness oscillations are observed .",
    "the concurrence of these two circumstances in quantum erasure for kaons allows for the following clarifying discussion .",
    "as previously described in the experiment ( a ) of the previous section , on the right moving kaon one has the choice to perform , _ actively _ , either a strangeness or a lifetime measurement ; this is the meter system since it is measured at a fixed time @xmath119 . for the left moving kaon one measures strangeness at a variable time @xmath78 ; this is then the object system .",
    "if @xmath128 , one operates in the normal , non  controversial mode : the left and right moving kaons are the object and the meter systems , respectively , and the meter mark is erased prior to the object strangeness measurement , @xmath129 .",
    "let us consider now the `` delayed choice '' case in which at a given @xmath78 , such that @xmath130 , strangeness is measured _ actively _ on the left moving kaon .",
    "assume as our first case that one chooses to measure strangeness on the right at @xmath119 : at these given times @xmath78 and @xmath119 one can momentaneously invert the roles of the object and meter kaons .",
    "one then operates as in the normal mode , @xmath131 , and thus reobtains the usual oscillations of eqs .",
    "( [ lsprob])([visibility ] ) where both @xmath132 and @xmath133 are _ even _ functions of @xmath134 .",
    "since @xmath135 is a time difference , one can then allow for variations in @xmath78 and thus reconsider the left moving kaon as the object , oscillating system .",
    "assume in a second case that one chooses to measure _ actively _ lifetime instead of strangeness on the right at @xmath119 : each one of the four possible joint probabilities show the non  oscillating feature .",
    "in both cases , the `` normal '' and `` delayed choice '' operation modes predict the same results .",
    "it should be drawn to the reader s attention that the above discussion applies to both _ active _ and _ passive _ measurements on both the left and right moving kaons .",
    "the case in which a _ passive _ strangeness measurement is performed on the meter provides a new concept of `` delayed choice '' that we can call a `` _ _ passive delayed choice _ _ '' .    more formally , for _ active _ joint measurements we can discuss again the issue in terms of projectors and time evolution operators .",
    "the various joint probabilities can be computed as the squared norms of the state @xmath136 where @xmath137 are the four projectors corresponding to the possible outcomes of each ( left or right ) measurement and @xmath138 are the time evolution operators , which are unitary since we retain and normalize to surviving kaon pairs .",
    "it is easy to show @xcite that the state @xmath139 with operators acting successively in the same order as in the normal mode ( @xmath140) has the same squared norm as the previous state ( [ state1 ] ) .",
    "this is so thanks to ( i ) the commutativity of the operators acting on different hilbert spaces and ( ii ) the properties of unitary time evolution . in the case of the `` delayed choice '' mode",
    ", the corresponding state with",
    "the appropriate ordering of the operators is @xmath141 conclusions -----------    under the assumption of @xmath32 conservation and the validity of the @xmath142 rule , we have shown that kaons admit two alternative procedures to measure their two complementary observables , strangeness and lifetime .",
    "we call these procedures _ active _ and _ passive _ measurements",
    ". the first one can be seen as an analog to the usual von neumann projection , while the second one is clearly different and takes advantage of the information spontaneously provided by neutral kaons through their decay modes .    in this paper",
    "we propose four different experiments combining _ active _ and _ passive _ measurement procedures in order to demonstrate the quantum erasure principle for neutral kaons .",
    "all the considered experiments lead to the same observable probabilities and more important for delayed choice considerations this is true regardless of the temporal ordering of the measurements . in our view , this illustrates the very nature of a quantum eraser experiment : it essentially sorts different events , namely , strangeness  strangeness events representing the `` wave  like '' property of the object kaon or strangeness  lifetime events representing the `` particle  like '' property of the object .",
    "time ordering considerations about the measurements are not relevant .",
    "the same is true for the measurement methods : active measurements with the intervention of the experimenter and passive measurements with no such intervention lead to equivalent results .",
    "neutral kaon experiments verifying the proposed quantum marking and eraser procedures has not been performed up to date . as the only exception , the cplear collaboration @xcite did part of the job required in our first setup of experiment ( a ) , showing the entanglement of kaon pairs from @xmath143 annihilation at rest through a measurement which tested the oscillatory behaviour of strangeness  strangeness joint detections for two values of @xmath144 .",
    "we think that the experiments proposed in this paper are of interest because they offer a new test of the complementarity principle and shed new light on the very concept of the quantum eraser .",
