    "despite of the close relation of particle - based iba techniques ( rbs , erda ,  ) with photon - based ones ( pixe , pige ,  ) , and despite the fact that they are often used to obtain complementary information about the same sample , the most popular iba analysis codes are focused either on one or the other category and data can not be analyzed in a coherent and unified way .",
    "an attempt to unify pixe and rbs analysis had been already done @xcite by building a common interface to the well known rump @xcite and gupix @xcite programs . in this work",
    "we present a more ambitious initiative in terms of integrated analysis of iba techniques : the implementation of the support for pixe in the datafurnace code ( which already supported rbs , erda , and non - resonant nra ) , achieved by using the recently developed libcpixe free library for pixe yield simulation @xcite .",
    "this implies that all the fitting capabilities already available in datafurnace for other techniques can now be applied to pixe , including simulated annealing fits and the bayesian inference error estimation .",
    "the integration of libcpixe with datafurnace , incorporates pixe to the repertory of supported techniques in the latter code .",
    "this opens up the possibility of _ simultaneously _ analyzing data from several spectra of a given sample and thus merging the information from all of them , producing a self  consistent result .",
    "note that the experimental spectra can be obtained with different techniques ( now including pixe ) as well as with the same technique under different experimental conditions in order to obtain complementary information about the sample .",
    "in contrast with the most widely used programs for pixe data analysis , which make use of nonlinear least squares or marquardt fitting algorithms @xcite , the datafurnace code implements simulated annealing and bayesian inference algorithms . the combination of these algorithms has proven to be a very powerful tool when dealing with iba problems in which one may have multiple and/or suboptimal formal solutions @xcite . in relation with pixe analysis ,",
    "this provides a very flexible fitting procedure that , _",
    "e.g _ , does not pose any limit to the analysis of layered samples with a given element present in more than one layer ( which is , currently , a limitation in the gupix code @xcite ) .",
    "the bayesian inference has also the advantage of providing a mathematically rigorous estimation of the errors in the fitted parameters ( concentration profiles for each element in the sample ) .",
    "the treatment of the pixe data in datafurnace differs from that done for other techniques or that done by other pixe analysis codes : instead of fitting the pixe spectra channel - by - channel , only user - selected characteristic x - ray peak areas are fitted ( avoiding the difficulties of fitting background and/or detector response functions and allowing to discard peaks which are non - apt for the fit ) . in order to identify the peaks and filter the background ,",
    "the qxas program @xcite can be used ( datafurnace can directly read its output files ) although a more convenient program is currently being developed and will be incorporated into the libcpixe library .",
    "besides this detail , the treatment of the pixe spectra in datafurnace is identical to that done for the other techniques .",
    "see @xcite for a detailed description on how the fitting process works in datafurnace , and how the information provided by different techniques about a given sample is merged .",
    "a typical case of ambiguity found in pixe spectra is related to the occurrence of non - resolved overlapping peaks .",
    "this can be handled either by simply ignoring them in the fit ( and relaying on other peaks for those elements ) or by fitting the sum instead of the separated values .",
    "note that in many cases , the ambiguities can be also ruled out by providing additional spectra ( pixe and/or other techniques ) or by setting constrains to the fit based on known information about the sample .",
    "a first example consists in obtaining the concentration of the elements present in a bulk stoichiometric sb@xmath1s@xmath2 sample .",
    "a pixe spectrum with 1.1 mev h@xmath3 was acquired using @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are , respectively , the incidence and detection angles relative to the surface normal .",
    "a bayesian fit of the areas of the sb @xmath8 and s @xmath9 peaks was performed ( the only free parameters in this case being the bulk concentration of s and sb as well as the beam fluence ) .",
    "the results , as shown in table [ t : results ] , reproduce the expected stoichiometric values and provide a reasonable error estimation reflecting mainly the statistical uncertainties in the experimental data .",
    "a second example consists in the analysis of a layered mn@xmath10ir / si sample ( a mn@xmath10ir film on top of a si substrate ) .",
    "a bayesian fit of the mn @xmath9 , ir @xmath8 and si @xmath9 lines of a 1.22mev h@xmath3 pixe spectrum ( with @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) was performed leaving the thickness and composition of the film as free parameters .",
    "the results are shown in table [ t : results ] and are compatible with the nominal values ( stoichiometric concentrations and a previous rbs thickness measurement ) within the errors estimated by the bayesian inference . in order to ascertain the accuracy of these results",
    ", we performed a simultaneous rbs+pixe analysis using the same pixe data as before and a 2 mev he@xmath3 rbs spectrum taken at normal incidence angle and 177 scattering angle . as expected ,",
    "the uncertainties are greatly reduced in this case ( see table [ t : results ] ) since the rbs data introduces a tight constrain in the thickness of the layer .",
    "when dealing with a more complex problem such as obtaining the concentration profiles for all elements in a gainassb / gasb sample , the information from a single pixe spectrum ( or a single rbs spectrum ) is not enough to solve the ambiguities of the fit .",
    "previous analysis of this kind of samples @xcite involved the separated analysis of rbs and pixe spectra and a manual iteration to obtain coherent results from both techniques .",
    "the datafurnace code now allows to perform the analysis in a much more convenient way : in the third example , the simultaneous analysis of six pixe spectra taken with different beam energies and incidence angles proves useful for characterizing the sample . the bayesian fit ( shown in fig .",
    "[ f : gainassb ] ) was performed assuming a ga@xmath13in@xmath14as@xmath15sb@xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) of unknown thickness and composition on top of a stoichiometric gasb substrate .",
    "the results , shown in table [ t : results ] , are compatible with those of previous characterizations of the same sample ( as seen in table [ t : results ] ) .",
    "is the proton beam energy . in geometry",
    "g1 , @xmath11 and @xmath18 whereas in geometry g2 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "spectra obtained using a proton beam of 1.05 mev were detected without any special filter between the chamber window and the be window of the detector .",
    "the remaining spectra were measured using a 1 mm thick mylar filter in front of the x - ray detector.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    finally , another bayesian fit has been performed incorporating a 2 mev h@xmath3 rbs spectrum ( see fig . [",
    "f : rbs ] ) to the mentioned set of six pixe spectra .",
    "the results in table [ t : results ] show that less uncertainties are present in this case compared to the pixe  only one due to the complementarity of the information provided by each technique : pixe is good at determining the amount of each element but has poor depth sensitivity while rbs provides good depth resolution but can not separate elements of similar mass ( such as ga  as or in  sb ) .",
    "it is interesting to remark the fact that this analysis has been performed in one single step , providing all the experimental data to the datafurnace code and obtaining a self - consistent result which is more reliable and considerably less time consuming than that obtained by using separated analysis codes .     on the same gainassb / gasb sample as in fig .",
    "[ f : gainassb ] .",
    "the fit ( solid line ) was performed considering not only the rbs spectrum but also the data from six pixe spectra ( those of fig .",

    "we have shown that the integration of libcpixe into the datafurnace code facilitates very interesting analysis modes such as the simultaneous pixe + rbs or the multiple ( differential ) pixe analysis .",
