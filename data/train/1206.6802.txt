    "this is in agreement with recent work that showed that , by using different potentials , configurations with very similar @xmath0 can have very different dynamics  @xcite .",
    "these results are potentially problematic for mode coupling theory as we have experimentally shown that the same static structure can give rise to very different dynamics  @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated that there is a peak in @xmath1 as a function of @xmath4 in a three - dimensional packing of soft pnipam colloids undergoing brownian motion .",
    "this is a vestige of the @xmath2 jamming transition that survives at finite temperature and is consistent with previous experiments in two - dimensional systems  @xcite .",
    "however , in contrast with the results in two - dimensions , the packing fraction , @xmath10 , where @xmath1 has a peak is significantly higher than @xmath5 , the packing fraction where particles would first jam at zero temperature .",
    "this indicates that , although the system is very far from the jamming point , aspects of the jamming transition are still observed in the structure of the sample .",
    "we have also shown that our soft colloid fluid will become dynamically arrested when the packing fraction is increased above @xmath5 .",
    "this is an example of a pressure induced glass transition  @xcite .",
    "we observe that the packing fraction where dynamical arrest occurs is close to but not identical with @xmath120 .",
    "we have also observed that the pair - correlation function for this soft - sphere system has features expected of a fluid .",
    "for example , the second peak in @xmath0 is smooth with no sign of any splitting that is characteristic of hard - sphere systems .",
    "moreover , near @xmath10 , we observe up to @xmath121 equally spaced peaks in @xmath0 whose amplitude decays as a function of distance in a fashion that is also consistent with predictions of liquid structure .",
    "as the packing fraction is decreased below @xmath10 , the damping of the peaks becomes much more dramatic so that near @xmath5 only three peaks are clearly visible .",
    "we observe that in fig . 4 , @xmath1 increases rapidly at low @xmath4 until it reaches a peak , but then decreases more gradually above @xmath120 .",
    "this asymmetry around the peak can be related to how the contributions to the overlap of particles from thermal motion and from pressure vary with packing fraction .",
    "the role of temperature in broadening the first peak rapidly becomes less important as the packing fraction is increased .",
    "because the pnipam colloids are so soft , it is possible to have very large particle overlap .",
    "this not only changes the structure of @xmath0 but also allows the system to be diffusive at packing fractions , @xmath4 , that are inaccessible to hard - spheres . to understand thermal systems at high densities , such as molecular glass formers , it is important to understand the dynamics of soft - sphere packings .",
    "further studies are needed on the dynamics in the neighborhood of @xmath10 , particularly in comparison to the dynamical heterogeneity and correlated motion observed in hard - sphere packings near @xmath5  @xcite .",
