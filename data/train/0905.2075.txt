    "recent observations of cosmic ray positron / electron fluxes by the pamela satellite  @xcite and atic balloon experiments  @xcite have shown excess of events compared with expected astrophysical backgrounds .",
    "ppb - bets  @xcite , which is another balloon experiment , also reported cosmic ray electron flux consistent with atic results .",
    "although more recent results of fermi satellite  @xcite and hess telescope  @xcite on the electron flux did not confirm such a sharp excess observed by atic , the positron excess observed by pamela still remains viable .",
    "while these anomalous positron / electron fluxes may be explained by some nearby high - energy astrophysical sources  @xcite , they can also be interpreted as evidence of dark matter annihilation / decay  @xcite .",
    "if the recent fermi data is fitted by dark matter annihilation / decay , a heavy dark matter with mass of order a few tev is favored  @xcite . in the case of annihilation ,",
    "the required annihilation cross section for reproducing the pamela anomaly is around @xmath0 , which is orders of magnitude larger than the standard value , @xmath1 . in order to fill this gap",
    ", one needs to invoke nonthermal dark matter production scenario @xcite or sommerfeld enhancement mechanism  @xcite giving velocity - dependent annihilation rate . in the case of decay",
    ", the required decay rate is about @xmath2 .    in order to confirm that the positron / electron excesses are caused by dark matter annihilation / decay ,",
    "cross checks by other observations are necessary .",
    "gamma - rays  @xcite , anti - protons  @xcite , anti - deuterons  @xcite and radio emission associated with the same annihilation / decay processes  @xcite may be used for this purpose . at the present stage , however ,",
    "no clear excess was found on those observations , and they give constraints on annihilating / decaying dark matter models .",
    "big - bang nucleosynthesis @xcite and the reionization  @xcite also give stringent constraints on annihilating dark matter models .",
    "it was also pointed out that dark matter annihilation / decay which explains the pamela anomaly may predict potentially large neutrino flux as well  @xcite , which are constrained from observations of super - kamiokande ( sk ) toward the direction of the galactic center  @xcite .",
    "dark matter annihilation ( decay ) yields high - energy neutrinos at the galactic center where the number density is enhanced , and they reach to the earth without energy loss . during the propagation , the neutrino oscillation effects mix three flavors ( @xmath3 ) . among them , some fraction of muon neutrinos are converted into high - energy muons due to the interaction with matter inside the earth , and if the interaction point is within around 1  km from the detector , produced muons penetrate the detector leaving characteristic signatures like the cherenkov light from a muon itself and/or from electromagnetic shower produced by it  @xcite . since the direction of a primary neutrino is conserved even after it is converted into a muon , sk limit on the muon flux from the galactic center direction provides useful constraint on dark matter annihilation / decay models  @xcite .    in this paper we further study the neutrino flux from the galactic center generated by dark matter annihilation / decay and how they are detected at the neutrino detector . since both conversion rate of neutrino into muon and muon energy loss processes in the earth matter",
    "depend on its energy , the signal of the high - energy neutrino has energy dependence . in particular , we distinguish _ showering _ and _ non - showering _ muon events at sk , following the criterion given in ref .",
    "as is expected , higher energy muons are likely to lose energy by radiative losses , developing electromagnetic shower inside the detector .",
    "interestingly , the probability for causing shower events becomes significant around the muon energy @xmath4 , which is a natural scale of dark matter mass .",
    "therefore such a separation , showering / non - showering events , has rich information on the initial neutrino energy spectrum and we show that it is a possible method to discriminate dark matter properties . this analysis can be applied to future neutrino detectors , such as km3net , for searching for dark matter , or even the present on - going experiments , such as sk , may be able to improve constraints on dark matter properties .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : muon ] we provide formulae to evaluate the upward showering and non - showering muon fluxes from the primary neutrino flux generated by dark matter annihilation / decay at the galactic center .",
    "applications to some dark matter annihilation / decay models is performed in sec .",

    "[ sec : conc ] is devoted to conclusions .",
    "in this section we develop a formalism to evaluate the upward muon flux starting from the initial neutrino energy spectrum produced by dark matter annihilation / decay .",
    "we assume that dm particle , denoted by @xmath5 , with mass @xmath6 annihilates ( decays ) into some final state @xmath7 with annihilation cross section ( decay rate ) @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the primary neutrino flux from the galactic center is given by @xmath10 for the case of annihilation , and @xmath11 for the case of decay , with @xmath12 where @xmath13 , and @xmath14 denotes the probability that the @xmath15 at the production is observed as @xmath16 at the earth due to the effect of neutrino oscillation and given as @xmath17 , and @xmath18 here , @xmath19  kpc and @xmath20 are the distance of the solar system from the galactic center and the local dark matter density near the solar system , respectively .",

    "the dependence on the dark matter halo density profile is contained in the remaining factor @xmath23 , defined by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the distance from us along the direction @xmath26 , which is the cone - half angle from the galactic center within the range @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the solid angle over which the neutrino flux is averaged .",
    "dark matter halo profile is characterized as follows : @xmath29^{(\\beta-\\gamma)/\\alpha}},\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the distance from galactic center .",
    "here we consider two typical density profiles : navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile  @xcite ( @xmath31kpc ) and cored isothermal profile ( @xmath32kpc ) .",
    "typical values of @xmath33 for these profiles are summarized in table  [ table : j ] .",
    "as is expected , dark matter halo with large core  @xcite predicts smaller neutrino flux , but the dependence on the halo profile is not so large compared with gamma - ray flux from the galactic center  @xcite , as long as the angular resolution is larger than @xmath34 .",
    "thus following discussion does not much depend on the halo profile and it is possible that neutrino signals are detectable while the gamma - ray constraints are satisfied .",

    "typical propagation distance of high - energy muons with energy @xmath38  tev is around 1  km , as will be shown .",
    "therefore , muons appearing only within 1  km around the detector can reach the detector , leaving their characteristic signals .",
    "the search strategy is to find upward muons in order to avoid cosmic - ray muon background .",
    "taking these processes into account , showering muon flux from the galactic center within cone - half angle @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the parent differential neutrino flux evaluated in the previous subsection , @xmath42 is the parent neutrino energy , @xmath43 denotes the probability that a neutrino with energy @xmath42 is converted into a muon with observable energy range , and @xmath44 is fraction of the showering muon in the total observed muon events with parent neutrino energy @xmath42 .",
    "the last ingredient , @xmath44 , is read off from fig .  5 of ref .  @xcite . by taking the ratio between black and black plus red lines in that figure",

    "notice that both the interaction cross section of neutrinos with nucleon and propagation distance of muons are roughly proportional to @xmath73 . therefore heavier dark matter",
    "has a tendency to provide more muon signals .",
    "this situation is quite different from other indirect signals , such as gamma - rays or positrons . for fixed annihilation cross section or decay rate , smaller fluxes of gamma - ray or positron",
    "will be predicted for heavier dark matter , since the number density of dark matter is inversely proportional to the dark matter mass . in the case of neutrino - induced muon signals",
    ", however , higher energy neutrinos more likely produce muon signals , so that it compensates the suppression from smaller number density of dark matter for heavier mass  @xcite .      before",
    "going into predictions of dark matter models , we evaluate the background muon events coming from atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "since we are interested in the upward muon events , we do not need to worry about background from atmospheric muons .",

    "@xcite , the background upward muon events are evaluated as @xmath74 and @xmath75 from the cone half angle @xmath76 ( corresponding to @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively ) .",
    "if dark matter prediction is larger than or comparable to those values , dark matter detection by neutrino - induced muon signals is promising .",
    "now let us evaluate the upward showering / non - showering muon flux following the procedure given in the previous section .",
    "we consider dark matter mainly annihilating ( decaying ) into @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .",

    "similarly , annihilating ( decaying ) into @xmath83 and @xmath84 lead to almost the same results , and we call those cases as `` hadronic annihilation ( decay ) '' . taking account of neutrino",
    "oscillation effects , annihilating ( decaying ) into @xmath85 and @xmath86 yield completely the same muon flux , but the case of @xmath87 predicts slightly smaller flux . in the following we call the former case as `` neutrino annihilation ( decay ) '' , since the characteristic behaviors are essentially the same .",

    "in the case of @xmath94 , muon fluxes are slightly smaller by an amount of @xmath95 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    as is easily seen from these figures , in the case of annihilation , the total muon flux remains roughly constant even if dark matter mass is increased for fixed annihilation cross section .",
    "this is because the annihilation rate is proportional to @xmath96 reflecting the fact that the rate is proportional to the square of dark matter number density , but the muon production cross section inside the earth and the muon propagation distance are both roughly proportional to @xmath6 , which cancels the @xmath6 dependence .",
    "however , the muon propagation distance deviates from the simple scaling @xmath97 when the radiative energy loss becomes important at @xmath98  gev ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : r_mu ] ) .",
    "thus for heavy dark matter with @xmath99gev , the predicted total muon flux shows mass dependence . on the other hand ,",
    "the showering muon is caused by high - energy component of the primary neutrino flux , and hence its mass dependence is quite different from the total muon flux , although the flux itself is suppressed .",
    "however , the showering muon flux prefers heavier dark matter mass , and atmospheric background flux is significantly reduced for higher energy region . thus we may have a chance to detect muon signals and observe separately non - showering and showering muons .",
    "mass scaling in the case of decaying dark matter can also be recognized in a similar way . since the decay rate per unit volume is only proportional to the dark matter number density ,",
    "the total muon flux is proportional to @xmath6 for fixed decay rate .",
    "this feature can be read off from the figures .    , but for annihilating ( decaying ) into @xmath83 .",

    "[ fig : ratio ] shows the ratio of the shower / total muon flux for various final states : @xmath100 and @xmath84 .",
    "this ratio is not sensitive to the neutrino flavors : @xmath101 and @xmath86 yield a common ratio .",
    "it is seen that the shower / total muon ratio is quite sensitive to the dark matter mass irrespective to the dark matter annihilation / decay modes . since this ratio expected from the atmospheric neutrino background",
    "is about 0.12 , the dark matter signals predict clearly large shower / total muon ratio . thus searching for muons signals with distinguishing showering and non - showering muons from particular direction may be useful for discriminating the signal from the background and constraining / extracting properties of dark matter .",
    "in this paper , we have studied how dark - matter originated neutrinos can be detected and how can we extract useful information on the dark matter properties , motivated by recent observations of anomalous cosmic - ray positron / electron fluxes .    for this purpose ,",
    "we have focused on the separation between showering and non - showering upward muon fluxes inside the neutrino detector . since muons with energy larger than about 500  gev lose their energy dominantly by radiative processes , such as bremmstrahlung and pair creation processes , searching for electromagnetic shower is a useful way to discriminate signals of high - energy neutrinos from atmospheric neutrino background . moreover , since the energy dependence of the total muon flux and showering muon flux are different from each other , measuring the ratio between them gives us information on the dark matter mass .",
    "a good point of muon search compared with gamma - ray and positron / electron flux is that the muon flux is enhanced for heavier dark matter due to the enhancement of the muon production and propagation distance inside the earth .",
    "thus our method has a particular benefit for rather heavy dark matter case , as is favored from the recent observations of the cosmic ray electron flux by the fermi satellite .",
    "the previous bound on the neutrino flux from the galactic center given in ref .",
    "@xcite comes from data of sk - i .",
    "since the superkamiokande accumulates more data now , the bound is expected to be improved soon .",
    "finally we mention possible applications to the on - going or future neutrino detectors .",
    "the icecube detector can not see the upward muon signals from the galactic center , since it is located at the south pole .",
    "a planned extension , called icecube deepcore  @xcite , may have a potential to search galactic center by looking at downward muons if atmospheric muons can be removed to the level of expected signals .",
    "although the sensitivity of the deepcore on the muon flux from the galactic center is difficult to estimate at the present stage , other targets such as dwarf galaxies may be used as a source of high - energy neutrinos .",
    "future megaton scale water tank detector , hyper - kamiokande , and kilometer size detector , such as km3net , is expected to significantly improve current sensitivities of sk and may be ideal experiments to search for the dark matter signatures by looking at the galactic center .",

    "<S> we study upward muon flux at neutrino detectors such as super - kamiokande resulting from high - energy neutrinos produced by the dark matter annihilation / decay at the galactic center . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we distinguish showering and non - showering muons as their energy loss processes inside the detector , and show that this information is useful for discriminating dark matter models . </S>"
