    "it is only a decade ago that a genuine brown dwarf was discovered ( @xcite ) and our experience in interpreting the spectra of brown dwarfs is still meager compared with the longer experience in the sun and stars .",
    "a new feature in ultracool dwarfs such as brown dwarfs is the presence of dust in their photospheres , the possible importance of which has been recognized at an early time ( @xcite ) . but how to treat the dust formed in the photospheric environment was not known .",
    "if a simple thermodynamical equilibrium is assumed , dust certainly forms but how to sustain the dust in the photosphere was unknown and dust also tends to be over - produced compared to the known observations in general . actually , dust in the observable photosphere should be controlled by such processes as nucleation , growth , segregation , precipitation , evaporation etc . , and we proposed a simple model referred to as the unified cloudy model ( ucm ) to take into account these processes semi - empirically ( @xcite ) .    in the ucm , we assumed that dust forms at the condensation temperature @xmath1 , but dust soon grows to be too large at a slightly lower temperature which we referred to as the critical temperature @xmath2 and segregates from the gaseous mixtures .",
    "thus dust forms a homogeneous cloud in the region where @xmath3 . in this model , @xmath1 is essentially determined by the thermodynamical data but @xmath4 is not predictable at present . at first , we assumed that @xmath4 remains the same throughout l and t dwarfs for simplicity .",
    "recent observations , however , revealed that @xmath2 , which is a measure of the thickness of the cloud ( a larger deviation of @xmath4 from @xmath1 implies a thicker cloud ) , shows a sporadic variation even at the fixed effective temperature ( sect.2 ) .",
    "our ucm is already formulated to allow for the change of @xmath2 and its application to the new situation is straightforward . compared with our previous interpretation of the spectra of l and t dwarfs based on a constant value of @xmath2 , our revised analysis allowing for the variation of @xmath2 in ucms results in a drastic change in our understanding of l and t dwarfs .",
    "it has been known that the infrared colors plotted against the spectral types show the red limit at late l dwarfs ( @xcite ) and this may be because the dust column density in the observable photosphere is the largest in late l dwarfs .",
    "although there were some scatters in the observed infrared colors , it appeared to be explained by our ucms with @xmath5k ( @xcite ) and we assumed a constant value of @xmath6k in our further applications of the ucms ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recent observations , however , revealed that the infrared colors ( @xcite ) show a large variation if they are plotted against @xmath7 based on the bolometric fluxes ( @xcite , @xcite ) and parallaxes ( @xcite ) .",
    "the case of @xmath8 is shown in fig.1 .",
    "the variation may not be explained by the effect of log@xmath9 and metallicity .",
    "the predicted values of @xmath8 for @xmath10k and @xmath1 ( this case implies that dust disappears as soon as it is formed and thus there is effectively no dust ) are overlaid on fig.1 .",
    "the variations of @xmath8 at a fixed @xmath7 are quite large , especially at around @xmath11k , and it is clear that the assumption of a constant @xmath12 can no longer be supported .",
    "the dust column density generally increases at lower @xmath7 ( at fixed @xmath13 ) and also at lower @xmath13 ( at fixed @xmath7 ) . for this reason ,",
    "the effects of @xmath7 and @xmath13 on the spectra so to speak degenerate and are difficult to discriminate unless one of them can be known by other methods . as an example , we reproduce the analysis of the l8 dwarf 2mass1523 based on @xmath14k ( @xcite ) in fig.2a , showing that this l8 dwarf can be accounted for by the ucm with @xmath15k ( cases i and ii are based on the ch@xmath16 opacities with the band model method and linelist , respectively ) .",
    "however , recent infrared photometry revealed that @xmath17k for 2mass1523 ( fig.1 ) and we analyzed the same spectra based on this @xmath13 value .",
    "the result shown in fig.2b reveals that the ucm with @xmath18k and @xmath19k provides a reasonable fit except for the water band regions .",
    "thus different combinations of @xmath7 and @xmath13 could explain the same spectrum so far as it is analyzed as a relative spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "[ ht ]    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]",
    "the ambiguity due to the degeneracy of @xmath7 and @xmath13 can be removed to some extend by transforming the observed spectra to the seds on an absolute scale with the use of the measured parallaxes and assuming the jupiter radius . as an example , it is immediately clear that the spectrum of 2mass1711 ( l6.5 ) reduced to the emergent flux on an absolute scale ( in unit of erg@xmath20sec@xmath21hz@xmath21 ) can not be fitted with the predicted spectrum based on the ucm with @xmath14k and @xmath22k ( fig.3a ) , even though the observed and predicted spectra can be fitted on the relative scale ( i.e. by the shapes of the spectra ) as done previously ( @xcite ) .",
    "the same observed spectrum is fitted better with the predicted one based on the ucm with @xmath18k and @xmath23k ( fig.3b ) , both on the absolute and relative scales .",
    "note that @xmath8 ( fig.1 ) suggests even a lower value of @xmath13 .",
    "thus the analysis of the sed on the absolute scale could discriminate the different possible combinations of @xmath7 and @xmath13 .",
    "as another example , the sed of sdss1750 ( t3.5 ) on an absolute scale can be fitted only marginally with the prediction based on the ucm with @xmath14k and @xmath24k ( fig.4a ) , and the predicted water bands appear to be too strong . the same observed sed",
    "is compared with the predicted one based on the ucm with @xmath25 and @xmath19k ( fig.4b ) .",
    "the observed and predicted seds now show better agreement both on the absolute and relative scales .",
    "note that the infrared color suggests @xmath26 for this object ( fig.1 ) .",
    "by the application of the ucms assuming a fixed value of @xmath14k throughout , the spectra of cool dwarfs from l6.5 to t3.5 shown in fig.5 could have been interpreted as a temperature sequence extending from 1800k to 1100k , as is reproduced in the 5-th column of table 1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the result of our reanalysis based on the seds on the absolute scale as outlined in sect.4 is summarized in the 6-th column of table 1 .",
    "the new result shows a drastic difference as compared with the previous one : the spectral sequence extending form l6.5 to t3.5 is nothing to do with @xmath7 but can be interpreted as the effect of @xmath12 alone .",
    "now a problem is which is a correct solution .",
    "we prefer the new solution by the following reasons : first , the variable @xmath12 is more consistent with the recent observations of the infrared colors ( fig.1 ) .",
    "second , the resulting values of @xmath27 are more close to the recent empirical values reproduced in the 7-th column of table 1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "third , it is evident that the analysis of the seds on the absolute scale should be preferred if possible , and the analysis of the seds on the relative scale ( or the shape of the spectra ) is misleading especially because of the degeneracy between @xmath27 and @xmath12 as shown in sect.3 .    in conclusion ,",
    "the l - t spectral sequence shown in fig.5 is not a temperature sequence but is due to the change of @xmath12 and hence of the thickness of the dust cloud .",
    "this conclusion is quite surpring in that @xmath7 plays little role in such a distinct change of spectra requiring the different spectral types l and t. this unexpected result is entirely due to dust , which should be more important than has been thought before .",
    "also a parameter that specifies the nature of the dust cloud , @xmath13 in our ucm , is sometimes more important than @xmath7 in the characterization of cool dwarfs .",
    "thus we confirm that @xmath13 should be regarded as a basic parameter together with @xmath7 and log@xmath9 .",
    "it is known that the absolute @xmath28 magnitude plotted against the l - t type shows an odd brightening at early t types ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it was suspected that this phenomenon may be due to some atmospheric effect , but no model including our ucm could explain this observation at all",
    ". the brightening is also observed in the @xmath29 and @xmath30 bands if not so pronounced as in the @xmath28 band .",
    "but then the absolute bolometric magnitude , which largely depends on the @xmath31 and @xmath30 fluxes , should also show the brightening and this is in fact found to be the case as shown in fig.6 .",
    "since the l and t dwarfs are evolving on the cooling tracks , their bolometric luminosities should never show `` brightening '' if they are plotted againt a correct temperature indicator .",
    "this result implies that the l - t spectral sequence may not be a temperature sequence , consistent with the conclusion of sect.5 , and the `` @xmath28-brightening '' as well as the `` @xmath0-brightening '' may simply be an artifact of the l - t spectral classification , in which the effects of @xmath7 and @xmath13 are mixed as shown in sect.3 .",
    "thus the so - called `` @xmath28-brightening '' problem is solved or , more properly , this problem now disappeared . instead a more serious problem of how to classify the spectra of ultracool dwarfs stands before us .",
    "in the interpretation of the spectra of dust - contaminated object such as brown dwarfs , a parameter that specifies the thickness of the dust cloud , @xmath13 in our formulation or @xmath32 in that of @xcite , plays an important role . at present",
    ", it seems to be difficult to predict the value of @xmath13 based on basic physics , especially because it is sporadic rather than related to the other basic parameters ( sect.2 ) .",
    "the variation of @xmath13 is especially large at @xmath33k where the second convective zone appears in addition to the one deep in the photosphere ( @xcite ) . it may be possible that @xmath13 is related to the convective activities , but details are yet to be explored",
    "thus , in addition to the four parameters generally required to specify the stellar photosphere , i.e. , chemical composition , @xmath7 , log@xmath9 , and micro - turbulent velocity , fifth parameter @xmath13 is needed for the characterization of dusty dwarfs .",
    "it is to be noted that the turbulent velocity is still determined empirically since its discovery more than half a century ago ( @xcite ) and not yet predictable based on basic physics for individual objects . at present , we must leave @xmath13 as an empirical parameter something like the turbulent velocity , but there are difficulties inherent to dust .",
    "for example , dust , unlike atoms and molecules , shows almost no clear spectral signature and it is difficult to estimate the dust column density directly . while dust plays significant role in defining the spectral characteristics , spectral classification had to be done on the spectral features originating from atoms and molecules ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and such a difficulty should be fatal in the spectral classification of dusty objects .    despite some formidable problems ,",
    "recent progress in observation of such faint objects as brown dwarfs , not only in spectroscopy but also in photometry and astrometry , is quite marvelous , and a more consistent interpretation can be achieved by considering all these data collectively ."
