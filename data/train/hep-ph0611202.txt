    "while in the minimal formulation of the standard electroweak model neutrinos are massless , there have been strong experimental evidences for nonzero neutrino masses and mixing of neutrino flavors which fortify the idea of pontecorvo  @xcite that nonzero neutrino mass and lepton flavor violation would produce spontaneous oscillation of neutrinos from one flavor to another in a manner similar to the strangeness oscillations of neutral kaons .",
