    "however , the discovery of superconductivity at 28 k in fluorine doped lafeaso @xcite , and the subsequent reports of transition temperatures greater than 50 k in some of the related rare - earth materials has generated great interest and a flurry of recent experimental and theoretical activity , generating preprints daily at arxiv.org/archive/cond-mat and numerous publications in just the first few months @xcite .",

    "however , study of the undoped materials is also important in developing an understanding of the superconductivity .",
    "the undoped material lafeaso has been reported to undergo a spin density wave ( sdw ) transition near 150 k @xcite , based on specific heat , resistivity , and reflectivity measurements .",
    "a structural phase transition has also been reported in this material at temperatures just above the magnetic transition @xcite . upon doping with fluorine",
    "the sdw is suppressed and superconductivity emerges @xcite .",
    "careful characterization of the behavior of lafeaso and other materials in this family is important in understanding the underlying physics responsible for these behaviors .",
    "here we report the results of our experimental investigation of lafeaso .",
    "we present structural analysis through the crystallographic phase transition from powder x - ray diffraction ( pxrd ) and investigation of the magnetic transition using neutron powder diffraction ( npd ) along with magnetization and mssbauer spectral measurements .",
    "signatures of these phase transitions are observed in ac - calorimetry heat capacity and resonant ultrasound spectroscopy ( rus ) measurements .",
    "the effects of the structural and magnetic transitions on the transport properties of lafeaso ( electrical resistivity , magnetoresistance , hall effect , seebeck effect , and thermal conductivity ) are also examined .",
    "we tried several methods for synthesizing high quality samples of lafeaso .",
    "starting materials were from alfa aesar and included la ( 99.9 % ) , la@xmath2o@xmath3 ( 99.99 % ) , fe ( 99.998 % ) , fe@xmath2o@xmath3 ( 99.998 % ) , and as ( 99.999 % ) .",

    "different synthesis routes will be distinguished by capital letters a - d in the discussion below .",

    "rietveld analysis @xcite indicates that the amount of each of these impurities was less than 5 % .",
    "it is likely that the iron containing impurities result from the reaction of the zr foil with as vapor in the tube , reducing feas ( a typical impurity phase when no metal foils are present ) to fe@xmath2as and fe .",
    "synthesis route b is identical to a except no metal foils were used .",

    "note that in ref .",
    "@xcite the lafeas sample was oxidized and that the spectra are actually those of lafeaso .",
    "the small , but non - zero , quadrupole shift indicates that there is a small lattice contribution to the iron(ii ) quadrupole interaction , as expected for low - spin iron(ii ) in a slightly distorted tetrahedral environment .",
    "the observed quadrupole shift is constant up to 140 k. at 150 and 295 k the quadrupole splitting is zero within the error bar .",
    "the introduction of a small , temperature independent , texture for the lafeaso phase , with intensity ratios of 3:2.3:1:1:2.3:3 yielded a significant reduction in @xmath14 and this texture was used for the fits in fig . [ moss ] .",
    "the temperature dependence of the isomer shift is in very good agreement with the debye model for the second order doppler shift and yielded a mssbauer temperature of 294(20 ) k , see lower inset in fig .",
    "the magnetic moment is essentially constant up to 75 k , and the gradual reduction of the hyperfine field above 125 k indicates a transition to a paramagnetic phase close 150 k. between 125 and 150 k , the lafeaso spectrum is more complex , as in refs .",
    "@xcite , and was modeled herein as a superposition of a sextet and a singlet , and the weighted average hyperfine field is shown in the upper inset of fig .",
    "the observed spectra between 125 and 150 k could be explained either by a small compositional variation and a smearing of @xmath36 or by a hyperfine field distribution resulting from a incommensurate or commensurate spin density wave @xcite or from spin glass behavior in this temperature range . at 75 k and below ,",
    "however , the simple sextet spectrum is indicative of no such spin density wave or spin glass behavior .",
    "finally , we observe a marginal increase in linewidth on cooling from 295 to 150 k , this increase could be related to the tetragonal to orthorhombic structural distortion .",
    "because the mssbauer spectra of lafeaso and feas @xcite are located in the same velocity region , detecting feas impurities requires careful comparison of the spectra near the 77 k neel temperature of feas .",
    "it is clear that the transition of feas from the helimagnetic to paramagnetic phase is responsible for the modification of the spectra between 65 and 75 k. the feas contribution above and below 70 k was found to be consistent with and then constrained to the hyperfine parameters for the corresponding temperatures of ref .",

    "285 k mssbauer temperature obtained from the second order doppler shift in feas , ref . @xcite and the line in the lower inset in fig . [ moss ] , is very close to 294 k observed herein for lafeaso .",
    "the only free fit parameters for the feas phase are the linewidth , and the isomer shift and average hyperfine field at 25 , 50 , and 65 k. we believe that the larger intensity of the 2:5 lines in the spectra of refs . @xcite arises not from a possible texturing of the sample but from an underlying feas impurity subspectrum .",
    "the presence of this feas impurity , if not properly modeled will lead to a smaller effective hyperfine field , as seen in ref . @xcite .",
    "further , it is likely that the third component observed in @xmath37sr measurements below 70 k @xcite is also related to the feas impurity that is clearly visible in the 78 k mssbauer spectrum on the same sample .",

    "at high temperatures lafeaso is a low carrier concentration metal with conduction dominated by electrons and with no local magnetic moment . this is supported by measurements of electrical resistivity ( figure [ rho ] ) ,",
    "hall coefficient and carrier concentration ( figure [ hall ] ) , seebeck coefficient ( figure [ sk ] ) , and magnetization ( figure [ mag ] ) . upon cooling",
    "a crystallographic phase transition occurs .",
    "we propose that the structural transformation occurs continuously below about 200 k based on structure refinements ( figure [ fig : fwhm - cells ] ) and elastic response ( figure [ rus ] ) , and that the kink in the order parameter b - a at 160 k ( figure [ fig : fwhm - cells]c ) indicates the point at which sufficient distortion has occurred to result in carrier localization and local moment formation on the fe atoms .",
    "this is supported by the small entropy associated with the transition at t@xmath17 ( figure [ cp ] ) .",
    "it is unclear what drives this structural transition .",
    "one candidate is a band jahn - teller effect @xcite , in which energy is gained by splitting the sharp peak in the density of states near the fermi level @xcite by distorting the crystal structure .",
    "this could result in localization of some conduction electrons and the development of a local magnetic moment on fe .",
    "careful theoretical analysis of the effects of structural distortion on the band structure of lafeaso could help resolve this issue . upon further cooling the local moments order near 145 k ( figure [ fig : neutron ] ) .",
    "strong electron - phonon coupling exists in the high temperature tetragonal phase , as evidenced by the behavior of the mobility ( figure [ hall]b ) , thermal conductivity , and seebeck coefficient ( figure [ sk ] ) through the phase transition region . upon doping with , for example , fluorine ,",
    "the structural phase transformation and associated magnetic ordering is suppressed ( figure [ fig : neutron ] ) , allowing the strong electron - phonon coupling present in the tetragonal phase to extend down to low temperature , and superconductivity emerges .",
    "it is believed that the phase transition is suppressed electronically by electron or hole doping with substitutional f or sr , or with oxygen vacancies .",
    "however , disorder may also suppress the structural transition .",
