    "the nature and the origin of dark energy is a fundamental puzzle in modern cosmology .",
    "most dark energy models can be constructed by using a slowly rolling canonical scalar field , termed as quintessence .",
    "however , there has been increasing interests in alternative models with a non - canonical kinetic term . among these models",
    "the most general formalism perhaps is k - essence @xcite .",
    "a more specific case is the tachyon field @xcite , which is motivated from string theory .",
    "it can be viewed as a special case of k - essence with dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) action @xcite .",
    "although the tachyon is an unstable field , its state parameter in the equation of state varies smoothly between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , thus many authors have already considered the tachyon field as a suitable candidate for a viable model of dark energy phenomenologically @xcite . for a review , we can refer to ref.@xcite .",
    "however , the dynamical dark energy models driven by a scalar field suffer from the so - called fine - tuning problem and coincidence problem . in order to address these problems ,",
    "one may employ scalar field models exhibiting scaling solutions @xcite .",
    "the scaling solutions as dynamical attractors can considerably alleviate these two problems .",
    "furthermore , by investigating the nature of scaling solutions , one can determine whether such behavior is stable or just a transient feature and explore the asymptotic behavior of the scalar field potential .",
    "many authors have investigated a lot of scalar field models containing scaling solutions .",
    "for instance , a canonical scalar field with an exponential potential has scaling attractor solutions @xcite . for quintessence dark energy model ,",
    "there are two scaling solutions .",
    "one is fluid - scalar field scaling solution , which remains subdominant for most of the cosmic evolution .",
    "it is necessary that the scalar field mimics the background energy density ( radiation / matter ) in order to respect the nucleosynthesis constraint and can also alleviate the fine - tuning problem of initial conditions .",
    "the other is scalar field dominated scaling solution , which is a late time attractor and gives rise to the accelerated expansion .",
    "since the fluid - scalar field scaling solution is non - accelerating , we need an additional mechanism exit from the scaling regime so as to enter the scalar field dominated scaling solution at late times .",
    "for the discussion on the exiting mechanism , we can refer to refs .",
    "@xcite .    for tachyon field",
    "dark energy , the scaling solutions have also been investigated by many authors , for example refs.@xcite . to be considered as a realistic model of dark energy , it is found that the fluid - scalar field scaling solutions are absent and only the scalar field dominated scaling solutions exist @xcite .",
    "this is very different from the quintessence case .",
    "therefore , just as pointed out in @xcite , tachyon models require more fine - tuning to be consistent with observations .",
    "nevertheless , it is worthwhile to point out that the fluid - scalar field scaling solutions may be obtained when the gauss - bonnet coupling between tachyon field and fluid is considered in the tachyon dark energy model@xcite .",
    "although the latest results of wmap5 have placed a constraint , @xmath2 @xcite , on the flatness of our observable universe , indicating that our observable universe is very close to flatness , it is still possible that our observable universe is spatially curved",
    ". therefore , it is also interesting to investigate the dynamical behavior of dark energy models in a spatially curved frw universe .",
    "recently copeland _ et.al .",
    "_ have extended such investigations to the quintessence model in spatially curved frw universe@xcite , following the strategy they have developed in ref.@xcite .",
    "sen and devi @xcite have also explored the scaling solutions with tachyon in modified gravity model employing the same method . in this letter",
    ", we will closely follow this route to investigate the dynamics of tachyon dark energy model in spatially curved universe .",
    "our letter is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the associated equations of motion for the tachyon field including the background fluid and obtain the scaling solutions .",
    "then , we analyze the stability of these solutions . in section iii",
    "we turn to construct the scalar potential leading to such scaling solutions . in particular , its asymptotical forms are obtained in various circumstances for spatially open and closed universe respectively .",
    "let us start with a cosmological model in which the universe is filled with a tachyon field @xmath3 evolving with a positive potential @xmath4 and a barotropic fluid with an equation of state @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the adiabatic index .",

    "we also note that when @xmath21 , the effective friedmann equation ( [ aa ] ) can be reduced to the standard spatially flat case .",

    "finally , from the above analysis , we note that the evolution of the universe including the curvature term is same as the case without the curvature term @xcite .",
    "however , due to the curvature term , the required potential is different . as shown in @xcite , in the case without curvature term ,",
