    "; collins , shull , & giroux 2004  hereafter denoted s03 and csg04 ) .",
    "most observers assume that this high - velocity o  vi is associated with infalling clouds in the galactic halo , including well - known objects such as the magellanic stream and complex c. however , in an alternative interpretation , nicastro et  al .",
    "( 2002 , 2003 ) suggest that the high - velocity o  vi , together with the @xmath3 x - ray absorption from o  vii , arise in the warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) surrounding the galaxy . in their model ,",
    "the o  vi and o  vii co - exist in a filament of shock - heated intergalactic medium ( igm ) , distributed over 13 mpc from the local group at very low hydrogen densities , @xmath1  @xmath2 , and high temperatures , @xmath4  k.    the hvcs possess velocities incompatible with differential galactic rotation ( wakker & van woerden 1997 ) and are normally detected through their 21-cm emission .",
    "they display a variety of different morphologies , ranging from large cloud complexes such as hvc complex c ( wakker et  al .",

    "richter et  al .",

    "although some of the correlates with -detected hvcs with column densities @xmath6 ( )  @xmath7 @xmath8 , the s03 survey catalogs a new class of hvcs with column densities below the detection threshold of single - dish radio telescopes . following the convention established in early studies of such objects ,",
    "we refer to the hvcs without 21-cm detections as the  highly ionized hvcs \" .",
    "sembach et  al .",
    "( 1995 , 1999 ) analyzed _ hst_-goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) data and found that these absorbers are characterized by strong absorption , accompanied by little or no absorption in low ions , hence the term  highly ionized . \"",
    "studies of the hvcs have recently been reviewed by sembach ( 2004 ) .    as is the case with most of the larger population of hvcs ,",
    "the origin of the highly ionized hvcs is uncertain because their distances are unknown .",
    "although the more extended hvc complexes must reside in or near the galactic halo ( @xmath9 kpc ) , one theory posits that the smaller - angular - size chvcs could be located at large distances ( @xmath10 mpc ) within the local group ( blitz et  al .",
    "1999 ; braun & burton 1999 ) . since the highly ionized hvcs are isolated absorbers , unconnected to extended objects mapped in , it is possible that such objects share a similar distribution as proposed for the chvcs within the local group .",
    "in fact , when the absorption in these objects in species ionized to and below has been modeled with single - phase photoionization models , the inferred densities ( @xmath11 @xmath2 ) and pressures ( @xmath12 @xmath2  k ) suggest a local group location ( sembach et  al .  1999 ; csg04 ) .",
    "however , the simultaneous and detections in hvcs imply a significant collisionally ionized component , arising from immersion in a surrounding hotter medium ( csg04 ; fox et  al .  2004 , hereafter f04 ) .",
    "when we attribute both the and absorption in the highly - ionized hvcs to the collisionally ionized component , the photoionized component can be considerably denser ( @xmath13 @xmath2 ) , with pressures more indicative of a galactic halo location in which @xmath14 @xmath2  k.    in contrast , nicastro et  al .",
    "( 2002 , 2003 ) suggest that the high - velocity absorbers trace large - scale ( local group ) filaments of the low - density ( @xmath15 @xmath2 ) whim .",
    "cosmological simulations predict that a large fraction of the baryons in the low - redshift igm are in the form of shock - heated ( @xmath16 k ) low - density structures ( cen & ostriker 1999 ; dav et  al .",
    "the nicastro et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) model for the @xmath3 absorbers is based on an interpretation of two observations .",
    "the first comes from the kinematics of the high - velocity absorbers , which suggest a preferred reference frame relative to the local group barycenter instead of the galaxy .",
    "we discuss this issue in depth in   4.1",
    "( see also fig .  1 for the locations and redshifts / blueshifts of the highly - ionized hvc sight lines , including the 12 we have studied ) .",
    "the second important observation is the detection of poorly - resolved and x - ray absorption lines at @xmath3 towards pks  2155@xmath17304 , 3c 273 , h 1821 + 643 , and mrk 421 ( fang et  al .",
    "2002 ; fang , sembach , & canizares 2003 ; mathur , weinberg , & chen 2003 ; nicastro et  al .",
    "2004 ) and the speculation that this absorption can be associated with the hvcs in those sight lines .",
    "mckernan , yaqoob , & reynolds ( 2004 ) recently discussed o  vii absorption at @xmath3 towards 15 agn .",
    "a number of important astrophysical issues are at stake in these two models , which for simplicity we classify as the whim and the galactic halo . among these issues",
    "are : ( 1 ) the total mass in hvcs , which depends on the square of the assumed distance ; ( 2 ) the role of hvcs in galaxy assembly , gaseous infall , and chemical evolution ; and ( 3 ) the possible connection between uv tracers of @xmath18  k gas ( o  vi , ne  viii ) and x - ray tracers of much hotter gas at @xmath19  k ( o  vii , o  viii , etc ) .",
    "the last issue could provide a connection between o  vi studies of galactic hvcs and cosmological measurements of the baryon content in the multiphase igm at low redshift ( shull 2003 ; nicastro et  al .",
    "2003 ; stocke , shull , & penton 2004 ) .",
    "the nicastro et  al .",
    "( 2002 , 2003 ) conclusions have been disputed ( csg04 ; sembach 2004 ) , since many hvcs are correlated in velocity and space with known galactic - halo hvcs mapped in 21 cm emission .",
    "more significantly , _ hst _  and _ fuse _  detections ( csg04 ) of low ions at the same velocities as o  vi require gas densities much higher than those in the whim .",
    "for example , the existence of and in the highly ionized hvcs towards pks  2155@xmath17304 suggests a characteristic hydrogen density @xmath20 @xmath2 , and models of the hvc complex c ( collins , shull , & giroux 2003 , hereafter csg03 ) suggest @xmath21 0.010.1 @xmath2 .",
    "csg04 argue that the data are best explained if the pks  2155@xmath17304 highly ionized hvcs are low total - hydrogen column density analogs of the galactic halo hvcs detected in 21 cm emission , rather than diffuse whim filaments .    in order to assess possible origins for the highly ionized hvcs , it is important to consider the population as a whole , instead of focusing on individual sight lines .",
    "we consider the statistics of a sample of 12 highly ionized hvcs , none of which is directly associated with known nearby 21 cm structures ( s03 ) . from these sight lines , we can better investigate whether the population traces the whim , or instead is a low - column version of the galactic halo hvcs .",
    "our previous study ( csg04 ) investigated highly ionized hvcs in two sight lines , pks 2155@xmath17304 and mrk 509 , and found low - ionization absorbers in both cases . in this paper , we present _ fuse _  and _ hst _",

    "<S> we use spectroscopic data from _ hst _  and _ fuse _  to study the wide range of ionization states of the  highly ionized high - velocity clouds \" . studied extensively in o  vi absorption </S>",
    "<S> , these clouds are usually assumed to be infalling gas in the galactic halo at distances less than 50 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative model attributes the o  vi ( and o  vii x - ray absorption ) to cosmological structures of low - density , shock - heated intergalactic gas , distributed over 13 mpc surrounding the milky way . </S>",
    "<S> the latter interpretation is unlikely , owing to the enormous required mass of gas ( @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our detection , in 9 of 12 sight lines , of low ionization stages ( c  ii / iii / iv ; si  ii / iii / iv ) at similar high velocities as o  vi requires gas densities far above that ( @xmath1  @xmath2 ) associated with the warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) . </S>",
    "<S> these hvcs are probably cooling , multiphase gas in the galactic halo , bow - shocks and interfaces between clouds falling through a hot , rotating gaseous halo . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity segregation of these hvcs in galactic coordinates is consistent with a pattern in which infalling clouds reflect the sense of galactic rotation , with peculiar velocities superposed . </S>"
