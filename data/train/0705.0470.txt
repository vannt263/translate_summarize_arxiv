    "a qcd sum - rule calculation of hadron parameters @xcite involves two steps : ( i ) one calculates the operator product expansion ( ope ) series for a relevant correlator , and ( ii ) one extracts the parameters of the ground state by a numerical procedure .",
    "each of these steps leads to uncertainties in the final result .",
    "the first step lies fully within qcd and allows a rigorous treatment of the uncertainties : the correlator in qcd is not known precisely ( because of uncertainties in quark masses , condensates , @xmath6 , radiative corrections , etc ) , but the corresponding errors in the correlator may be systematically controlled ( at least in principle ) .",
    "the second step lies beyond qcd and is more cumbersome : even if several terms of the ope for the correlator were known precisely , the hadronic parameters might be extracted by a sum rule only within some error , which may be treated as a systematic error of the method .",
    "it is useful to recall that a successful extraction of the hadronic parameters by a sum rule is not guaranteed : as noticed already in the classical papers @xcite , the method may work in some cases and fail in others ; moreover , error estimates ( in the mathematical sense ) for the numbers obtained by sum rules may not be easily provided  e.g. , according to @xcite , any value obtained by varying the parameters in the sum - rule stability region has equal probability .",
    "however , for many applications of sum rules , especially in flavor physics , one needs rigorous error estimates of the theoretical results for comparing theoretical predictions with the experimental data .",
    "systematic errors of the sum - rule results are usually estimated by varying the borel parameter and the continuum threshold within some ranges and are believed to be under control .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study systematic uncertainties of the sum - rule procedure in detail . to this end , a quantum - mechanical harmonic - oscillator ( ho ) potential model is a perfect tool ( see also @xcite ) : in this model both the spectrum of bound states ( masses and wave functions ) and the exact correlator ( and hence its ope to any order ) are known precisely .",
    "therefore one may apply the sum - rule machinery for extracting parameters of the ground state and check the accuracy of the extracted values by comparing with the exact known results . in this way the accuracy of the method can be probed .",
    "we show that the knowledge of the correlator in the limited range of the borel parameter is not sufficient for a reliable extraction of the ground - state characteristics from the sum rule , even if the mass of the ground state is known .",
    "one should also know the continuum contribution to the correlator with a good accuracy .    in connection with this observation ,",
    "we indicate two dangerous points in a typical sum - rule analysis : ( i ) a simple modeling of the hadron continuum by a constant effective continuum threshold leads to uncontrolled errors in the extracted hadron parameters .",
    "this occurs even in the case when the true effective continuum threshold may be well approximated by a constant , as it happens in the ho model considered .",
    "( ii ) the independence of the extracted ground - state parameter of the borel mass does not guarantee the extraction of its true value .",
    "we consider a non - relativistic potential model with the ho potential @xmath7 and study the polarization operator @xmath8 defined by @xmath9 with @xmath10 the full green function of the model , @xmath11 the full green function satisfies the lippmann - schwinger operator equation @xmath12 which may be solved perturbatively : @xmath13 for the polarization operator given by a dispersion representation @xmath14 the borel transform @xcite has the form @xmath15 therefore the borel transform corresponds to the evolution operator in the imaginary time @xmath16 : @xmath17 for the ho potential ( [ 1.1 ] ) , the exact @xmath0 is known @xcite : @xmath18 expanding this expression in inverse powers of @xmath19 , we get the ope series for @xmath0 : @xmath20 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and higher coefficients may be obtained from ( [ piexact ] ) .",
    "each term of this expansion may be also calculated from ( [ pi ] ) and ( [ ls2 ] ) , with @xmath21 corresponding to @xmath22 : @xmath23 the `` phenomenological '' representation for @xmath0 is obtained by using the basis of hadron eigenstates of the model , namely @xmath24 with @xmath25 the energy of the @xmath26-th bound state and @xmath27 given by @xmath28 the quantity @xmath27 determines the square of the leptonic decay constant of the @xmath26-th bound state .    for the lowest states one has ) and",
    "therefore the excited states contributing to ( [ piexact ] ) are separated in energy by multiples of @xmath29 from the ground state . ]",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 for later use we isolate the contribution of the ground state and write @xmath32 where @xmath33 describes the contribution of the excited states ( the model has purely discrete spectrum , but we use the qcd terminology and refer to the excited states as the `` continuum '' ) , @xmath34 is the continuum threshold and @xmath35 is the spectral density corresponding to excited states . for the ho potential ,",
    "the continuum threshold lies at @xmath36 .",
    "the sum rule claims the equality of the correlator calculated in the `` quark '' basis ( [ piope ] ) and in the hadron basis ( [ piphen ] ) : @xmath37.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] following @xcite , we use explicit expressions for the power corrections , but for the zero - order free - particle term we use its expression in terms of the spectral integral ( [ pi0 ] ) .",
    "the reason for this will become clear in few lines .    let us introduce the effective continuum threshold @xmath38 , different from the physical @xmath19-independent continuum threshold @xmath34 , by the relation @xmath39 generally speaking , the spectral densities @xmath35 and @xmath40 are different functions , so the two sides of ( [ zeff ] ) may be equal to each other only if the effective continuum threshold depends on @xmath19 . in our model , we can calculate @xmath33 precisely , as the difference between the known exact correlator and the known ground - state contribution , and therefore we can obtain the function @xmath38 by solving ( [ zeff ] ) numerically . in the general case of a sum - rule analysis ,",
    "the effective continuum threshold is not known precisely and is one of the essential fitting parameters .",
    "making use of ( [ zeff ] ) , we rewrite now the sum rule ( [ sr ] ) in the form @xmath41 where the cut correlator @xmath42 reads @xmath43 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as is obvious from ( [ sr2 ] ) , the cut correlator satisfies the equation @xmath44 the cut correlator is the actual quantity which governs the extraction of the ground - state parameters",
    ". it might be useful to notice that the relative weight of power corrections in the cut correlator @xmath42 has been considerably increased compared to the initial @xmath45 : whereas in @xmath45 power corrections are suppressed as @xmath46 compared to the free - particle term , in @xmath42 they are suppressed only as @xmath47 compared to the cut free - particle term . in the problem under discussion this makes no difference since the power corrections are known precisely .",
    "in qcd this , however , leads to additional uncertainties since condensates are not always known with good accuracy .    the sum rule ( [ sr2 ] )",
    "allows us to restrict the structure of the effective continuum threshold @xmath38 .",
    "let us expand both sides of ( [ sr2 ] ) near @xmath48 .",
    "the l.h.s .",
    "contains only integer powers of @xmath49 , i.e. , even powers of @xmath50 .",
    "power corrections on the r.h.s .",
    ", on the contrary , contain only odd powers of @xmath50 . in order",
    "that both sides match each other , the effective continuum threshold should be a power series of the parameter @xmath50 : @xmath51 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] inserting this series in ( [ sr2 ] ) and expanding the integral on its r.h.s .",
    ", we obtain an infinite chain of equations emerging at different orders of @xmath50 .",
    "the equations corresponding to the odd powers of @xmath50 do not contain the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath5 and constrain the odd - number coefficients @xmath52 which provide the cancellation of power corrections on the r.h.s .  of ( [ sr2 ] ) .",
    "the three lowest - order equations read @xmath53 what is essential is that the @xmath54-th equation contains only the variables @xmath55 .    setting @xmath56 and @xmath57 , the equations above yield the following solution for the exact effective continuum threshold in the ho model : @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , etc .",
    "the following comments are in order here :    * equation ( [ 2 ] ) rules out the @xmath19-independent solution @xmath61 . * for @xmath2 and @xmath5 within a broad range of values @xmath62",
    "there exists a solution @xmath63 which _ exactly _ solves the sum rule ( [ sr ] ) . here",
    ", the upper boundary @xmath64 is determined from the condition that the ground state fully saturates the correlator at @xmath65 , the lower boundary of the considered @xmath19-interval : @xmath66 for @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "+ therefore , in a limited range of @xmath19 the ope alone can not say much about the ground - state parameters .",
    "what really matters is the continuum contribution , or , equivalently , @xmath38 . without constraints on the effective continuum threshold the results obtained from the ope are not restrictive .. then the discrete spectrum of states is replaced by a continuous spectrum .",
    "however , for sufficiently large values @xmath69 , the power corrections remain numerically almost unchanged .",
    "so the borel - transformed ope is not very sensitive to the dynamics at long distances .",
    "] * the approximate extraction of @xmath2 and @xmath5 worked out in a limited range of values of @xmath19 becomes possible only by constraining @xmath38 . if the constraints are realistic and turn out to reproduce with a reasonable accuracy the exact @xmath38 , then the approximate procedure works well .",
    "if a good approximation is not found , the approximate procedure fails to reproduce the true value .",
    "anyway , the accuracy of the extracted value is difficult to be kept under control .",
    "the last conclusion is quite different from the results of qcd sum rules presented in the literature ( see e.g.  the review @xcite ) . in the next section we shall demonstrate that a typical sum - rule analysis contains additional explicit or implicit assumptions and criteria for extracting the parameters of the ground state . whereas these assumptions may lead to reasonable central values , the accuracy of the extracted parameters can not be controlled .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      strictly speaking , the constant effective continuum threshold @xmath70 is incompatible with the sum rule , as it can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , this ansatz may work well , especially in our model : as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) , the exact @xmath38 is almost flat in the fiducial interval . therefore , the ho model represents a very favorable situation for applying the qcd sum - rule machinery .",
    "now , one needs to impose a criterion for fixing @xmath71 .",
    "one of the widely used ways is the following @xcite : one calculates @xmath72 the r.h.s .",
    "depends on @xmath19 due to approximating @xmath38 with a constant .",
    "then , one determines @xmath73 and @xmath71 as the solution to the system of equations @xmath74 yielding the values @xmath75 and @xmath76 , see fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a , b ) .",
    "the central value of the sum - rule estimate @xmath3 is obtained by setting @xmath77 , and @xmath78 in ( [ sr2 ] ) . for this value of @xmath71 one",
    "has a very good description of @xmath0 ( less than 1% deviation in the full range @xmath79 ) and the stability of @xmath80 against @xmath19 is also very satisfactory .",
    "finally , in the model under discussion one obtains also a rather good estimate @xmath81 , with the function @xmath82 being extremely stable in the region @xmath83 .",
    "note , however , a dangerous point : the description of @xmath0 with better than 1% accuracy and the deviation of the @xmath80 from @xmath2 at the level of only 1% in the fiducial range leads to a 4% error in the extracted value of @xmath3 !    the crucial conclusion from this observation is the following : even when the effective continuum threshold @xmath38 is almost flat in the fiducial interval of @xmath19 , as in our simple model , one still can not control the accuracy of the extracted value of @xmath3 . as is obvious from fig .",
    "[ fig:2](c ) , it would be incorrect to estimate the error , e.g. , from the range covered by @xmath3 when varying the borel parameter @xmath19 within the fiducial interval .",
    "let us consider another scheme : a local - duality ( ld ) sum rule proposed in @xcite .",
    "this scheme corresponds to the limit @xmath84 in ( [ sr2 ] ) and has several attractive features @xcite . in the limit @xmath84 all power corrections in the ope vanish and we end up with the simple relation ( cf .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) ) @xmath85 let us consider the average energy calculated with the cut correlator @xmath86 it is natural to require @xmath87 .",
    "then @xmath88 and ( [ ldsr1 ] ) leads to @xmath89 as follows from ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) , the exact values @xmath5 and @xmath2 satisfy the equations @xmath90 comparing these equations with ( [ ldsr1 ] ) and ( [ ldsr2 ] ) , we see that if @xmath87 , then @xmath91 .",
    "this leads to the 5% discrepancy in ( [ ldsr4 ] ) .",
    "anyway , the estimate ( [ ldsr4 ] ) is quite good ( due to the specific values of the constants @xmath92 in the ho model ) but its accuracy can not be controlled .    closing this section",
    ", we note that the issue of the uncertainties within qcd sum rules ( see also @xcite for the case of light - cone qcd sum rules ) appears to be qualitatively similar to what happens in other phenomenological approaches , like the constituent quark model , which have indeed many common features with sum rules , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "we studied the extraction of the ground - state parameters from the polarization operator using various versions of sum rules in the case of the non - relativistic harmonic - oscillator potential model .",
    "the advantage of such a simple model is that both the ope for the polarization operator and the exact spectrum are known , therefore allowing us to compare the results obtained by sum rules with the exact values and to probe in this way the uncertainties of the method .      *",
    "the knowledge of the correlator in a limited range of the borel parameter @xmath19 is not sufficient for an extraction of the ground - state parameters with a controlled accuracy , even if the ground - state mass is known precisely : rather different models for the correlator in the form ( [ fit ] )  a ground state plus an effective continuum , described by an effective continuum threshold @xmath38  lead to the same correlator . *",
    "the procedure of fixing the effective continuum threshold by requiring that the average mass calculated with the cut correlator ( [ cut ] ) should reproduce the known value of the ground - state mass @xcite is , in general , not restrictive : a @xmath19-dependent effective continuum threshold @xmath38 which solves the sum rule ( [ fit ] ) leads to the cut correlator ( [ cut ] ) which automatically ( i ) reproduces precisely @xmath93 for all values of the borel parameter @xmath19 , and ( ii ) leads to the @xmath19-independent value of @xmath3 which , however , may be rather far from the true value .",
    "+ in the model considered we obtained the following results : + \\a . without constraining @xmath38 , for any value of @xmath3 within the range @xmath94 one can find a function @xmath38 which exactly solves the sum rule for @xmath95 .",
    "+ \\b . requiring @xmath96 for @xmath97",
    "gives @xmath98 .",
    "* we studied in detail the standard approximation of the effective continuum threshold with a constant @xmath71 . within this approximation",
    ", one can tune the value @xmath71 by requiring that the average energy @xmath99 calculated with the cut correlator ( [ cut ] ) should reproduce the ground - state energy @xmath2 in the stability region . in the model under discussion , one obtains in this way a good estimate @xmath81 , with practically @xmath19-independent @xmath3 .",
    "the unpleasant feature is that the deviation of @xmath3 from @xmath5 turns out to be much larger than the variations of @xmath99 and @xmath3 over the range @xmath100 . and , more importantly",
    ", error estimates for @xmath3 can not be provided . *",
    "therefore , we conclude that a sum - rule extraction of the ground - state parameters without knowing the hadron continuum suffers from uncontrolled systematic uncertainties ( not to be confused with the uncertainties related to errors in quark masses , @xmath6 , renormalization point , condensates , etc ; the latter errors are usually properly taken into account ) . unfortunately , a typical sum - rule analysis of heavy - meson observables belongs to this class of problems : in this case , the hadron continuum is usually not known and is modeled by an effective continuum threshold treated as a fit parameter .",
    "then , no estimates of systematic errors for the ground - state parameters obtained with sum rules can be given , although the central values may be rather close to the true values .",
    "let us also emphasize an important point : as we have demonstrated , the independence of the extracted hadron parameters from the borel mass does not guarantee the extraction of their true values .",
    "we have nevertheless seen that in the model under consideration the sum rules give good estimates for the parameter @xmath5 .",
    "this seems to be due to the following specific features of the model : ( i ) a large gap between the ground state and the first excitation that contributes to the sum rule ; ( ii ) an almost constant exact effective continuum threshold in a wide range of @xmath19 . whether or not the same good accuracy may be achieved in qcd , where the features mentioned above are absent , is not obvious : within the standard procedures adopted in qcd sum rules it is practically impossible to control the systematic uncertainties of the obtained hadron parameters .",
    "this shortcoming  the impossibility to control the systematic errors  remains the weak feature of the method of sum rules and an obstacle for using the results from qcd sum rules for precision physics , such as electroweak physics .",
