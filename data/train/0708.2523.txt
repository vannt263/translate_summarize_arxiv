    "neutron matter is of great interest in nuclear physics as a quantum many - body system .",
    "the @xmath0 nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath4 ) interaction is strongly attractive , dominating the physics of neutron matter .",
    "the interaction yields the negative ( in our convention ) scattering length @xmath5 of an unnaturally large magnitude ( @xmath6 fm ) , with the effective range @xmath7 of a moderate ( natural ) size of about twice the pion wavelength ( @xmath8 fm ) .",
    "the value of @xmath5 implies that the strongly attractive interaction nearly forms a bound state . by this pairing ,",
    "neutron matter is a strongly interacting many - body system , which must be treated nonperturbatively @xcite .",
    "the strong neutron pairing generates a pairing gap that creates superfluidity in neutron matter .",
    "superfluidity in neutron matter is of astronomical interest because of the close relation to the internal structure and thermal evolution of neutron stars @xcite . @xmath0 and @xmath9-@xmath10 superfluidity",
    "are believed to be realized in the inner crust and in the core region of neutron stars , respectively , and to contribute to the thermodynamic and dynamic properties of the stars .",
    "neutron pairing is also considered important for understanding the structure of neutron - rich unstable nuclei .",
    "neutron - neutron correlations are expected to be a crucial ingredient in the weakly bound , surface structure near the neutron drip line ; and for the surface structure , neutron pairing in neutron matter must be well understood @xcite .",
    "investigations over many years have provided much understanding of the physics of thermodynamic properties of neutron matter @xcite , but reliable quantitative information of the thermal properties has not been fully available @xcite . for example , the @xmath0 pairing gap at zero temperature @xmath11 had been firmly established _ in the bcs approximation _ , as evident in the fact that various conventional @xmath4 potentials have provided nearly the same @xmath12 as a function of neutron matter density @xcite .",
    "many - body calculations beyond the bcs mean - field approximation , however , have yielded @xmath11 of various magnitudes , generally smaller than the bcs values , some even by a factor of @xmath13 or more .",
    "quantum monte carlo calculations , based on a nonperturbative approach , have also been used on the @xmath11 determination .",
    "the green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) method , quite successful in treating the ground - state properties of finite nuclei by the use of the conventional @xmath4 potentials @xcite , has yielded @xmath11 in the low - density region ( @xmath14 0.6 @xmath15 ) , smaller than @xmath12 @xcite but not as small as those obtained by some of the many - body calculations .",
    "another method closely related to gfmc , the auxiliary field diffusion monte carlo ( afdmc ) method , which is also applied to finite nuclei @xcite , has given @xmath11 quite close to @xmath12 @xcite and significantly larger than the gfmc @xmath11 .",
    "we present a more detailed comparison of these works , including ours , in sec .",
    "vii b.    in this paper , we report a quantum monte carlo calculation of @xmath11 and thermal properties of neutron matter using a method different from the gfmc and the afdmc methods .",
    "the difference is that ours is based on the standard finite - temperature , grand canonical formulation , while the gfmc and afdmc methods are based on essentially zero - temperature formulations , performed for the ground or specific excited states with a pre - fixed neutron number .",
    "our calculation may be viewed , in a sense , as a nonrelativistic hadronic version of lattice qcd calculations , but it involves different aspects such as those associated with the large numbers of fermions on the lattice @xcite .",
    "we use a hamiltonian formulation different from the lagrangian formulation commonly used in the lattice qcd calculations .",
    "our formulation is not new , as it has been applied in condensed matter physics for many years @xcite and has been also applied in nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "this work is an extension of the latter .",
    "we also use a new ingredient , the @xmath4 interaction based on effective field theory ( eft ) @xcite , in place of the conventional @xmath4 potentials .",
    "it is desirable to include pions @xcite in the eft interaction as dynamical degrees of freedom , representing chiral symmetry and its breaking .",
    "our objective is twofold : ( 1 ) to apply the @xmath4 eft interaction to the many - nucleon system of neutron matter by properly applying eft counting rules , and ( 2 ) to determine reliably the thermal properties of neutron matter and their key quantities , such as @xmath11 . in the first attempt for achieving this objective , we have chosen a pionless",
    "@xmath4 eft potential with two parameters .",
    "the major consequence of this choice is that application of our calculation is limited to the low - density region , @xmath16 @xmath17 .",
    "even with this potential , our work has become a relatively large - scale computation , especially because we take the thermodynamic limit and examine the continuum limit .",
    "note that field theoretical aspects of the general approach of this work were discussed a few years ago @xcite .    because the pairing in neutron matter is strong ,",
    "neutron matter should be treated as a strongly correlated fermionic system in the state of bcs - bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) crossover , which has been receiving much attention in recent years @xcite .",
    "traditionally the pairing in neutron matter has been discussed in the framework of the bcs approximation @xcite , but the pairing is too strong for a bcs treatment .",
    "the pairing strength is characterized by @xmath18 and corresponds to the bcs limit with @xmath19 and to the bec limit with @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the range of @xmath18 in the low - density region investigated in this work is well in the middle of the two limits , @xmath21 , and the magnitude of @xmath18 becomes smaller for a higher density .",
    "we elaborate on the issue of crossover in sec .",
    "vii a.    the limit @xmath22 corresponds to the unitary limit , to which much attention has been paid lately in the fields of atomic and condensed - matter physics .",
    "a fermion pair in the unitary limit forms a zero - energy bound state , thereby yielding a scattering length infinitely long , associated with no classical scale and expected to have a universal feature .",
    "our single - parameter eft description of low - density neutron matter is close to the unitary limit ( rather than to the bcs limit ) , and we will discuss the relation between the two in an accompanying paper @xcite .",
    "we emphasize , however , that the close similarity of the two is restricted to the low - density region of neutron matter ( @xmath23 @xmath15 ) , because additional eft parameters and the pionic contributions needed for the description of the denser region introduce new length scales and make the physics more complicated than that of the unitary limit .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "after the introduction of sec .",
    "i , the basic setup of our calculation is described in sec .",

    "iii , we present how we determine the physical quantities of interest in this work , and in sec .",

    "vi , and discussions of the key points in this work are given in sec .",

    "we include , in appendix a , a relevant , short discussion on how the two @xmath4 potential parameters are determined by satisfying eft counting rules ; in appendix b , a comparison of the physical sizes of a neutron ( cooper ) pair and the computational lattices ; and , in appendix c , somewhat detailed technical aspects of our monte carlo calculation .",
    "the nuclear eft lagrangian is constructed by including all possible terms allowed by symmetries of the underlying theory of qcd @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 potential from the eft lagrangian is written in the momentum expansion form @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the @xmath4 center - of - mass momenta , and @xmath27 is the regularization scale .",

    ", we have @xmath34 ( @xmath35 , the pion mass ) .",
    "note that the potential consists of the central and spin - dependent parts , as @xmath36 , with @xmath37 for the @xmath38 state ( and @xmath39 for the @xmath40 state , not considered in this work ) .",
    "we also neglect in this work the @xmath41-wave interaction term starting with the @xmath42 and the relativistic effects appearing in @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "regularization is required for the application of eq .",
    "( [ eftpot ] ) . on a cubic lattice ,",
    "the lattice spacing @xmath44 serves as the regularization scale @xmath27 , approximately as @xmath45 @xmath27 should generally be set large , at least larger than the momentum @xmath46 , @xmath47 or better set @xmath48 corresponding to @xmath49 fm for @xmath50 @xcite .",

    "this assures us that @xmath59 and @xmath60 are safely determined from @xmath5 and @xmath7 for a chosen value of @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "these interaction parameters are determined by consistently applying eft power counting rules in a way different from a mere phenomenological fitting , as briefly discussed in appendix a. because this determination is one of the crucial steps in this work , let us note its key point here : _ @xmath60 and the contributions of the same order must be treated perturbatively _ by neglecting the @xmath70 ^ 2)$ ] contributions , so that @xmath71 contributions are consistently neglected .",
    "furthermore , _ to be consistent , @xmath60 and the contributions of the same order must also be treated perturbatively in the neutron matter calculations_. in the next subsection , we discuss how this treatment is formulated for the neutron matter calculation .    in this work ,",
    "we carry out the neutron matter calculation using eq .",
    "( [ exthubbard ] ) in two different ways : the leading - order ( lo ) calculation , in which the @xmath60 contribution and the contributions of the same order are neglected , and the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) calculation , in which they are included .",
    "the lo and nlo calculations are expected to yield somewhat different physics , because eq .  ( [ exthubbard ] ) is the hamiltonian of the attractive hubbard model for the lo calculation , and it is the hamiltonian of an extended attractive hubbard model for the nlo calculation @xcite . with the neglect of @xmath72 , the lo calculation involves the neutrons of low momenta and should be applicable to a low - density region of neutron matter without the perturbative treatment .",
    "an important issue in this work is the density at which the lo and nlo results should be matched .",
    "the ere of eq .",
    "( [ effexp ] ) suggests that the center - of - mass momentum of an interacting neutron pair is less than @xmath73 at the matching density . as a rough estimate , it may be feasible to identify the fermi momentum @xmath74 as this momentum and to estimate the density from it @xcite , but for a rigorous matching , the lo and nlo neutron matter calculations should be carried out for some common densities and their results compared . as it is desirable to avoid excess computer time ,",
    "we use in this work the following procedure : we carry out the lo and nlo calculations at the common density of @xmath75 0.3041 @xmath76 , where we expect the two results will certainly differ , and then perform similar calculations by lowering the density so as to identify the density that yields the same lo and nlo results ( within the statistical uncertainties ) . the matching using this procedure is elaborated in sec .  v.      we follow a lattice hamiltonian formulation , somewhat different from the lagrangian formulation usually used in lattice qcd @xcite . instead of using the representation in terms of coherent - state grassmann variables , we use the number representation , working with the lattice fock space @xmath77 using the creation and annihilation operators of the neutrons .",

    "the hamiltonian ( [ exthubbard ] ) should also include three - nucleon interactions . by eft power counting rules ,",
