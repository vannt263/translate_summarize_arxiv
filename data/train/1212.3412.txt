    "the gradual flux penetration in type - ii superconducting films is occasionally interrupted when large amounts of magnetic flux rush in from the edges , forming complex dendritic patterns inside the specimen .",
    "experiments using magneto - optical imaging have revealed that such dendritic avalanches take place in numerous materials , e.g. , nb,@xcite yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2,@xcite mgb@xmath0,@xcite nb@xmath1sn,@xcite yni@xmath0b@xmath0c,@xcite pb  @xcite and nbn;@xcite see also ref .   for a review .",
    "the similarity in the avalanche morphology in so different materials strongly suggests that the origin of the phenomenon is of a universal nature .",
    "indeed , it is today widely agreed that the dendritic instability originates from a thermomagnetic breakdown in the superconductor.@xcite this can occur when a small temperature fluctuation locally weakens the pinning of the vortices , causing some magnetic flux to advance into the superconductor .",
    "since moving flux releases heat , the local temperature then increases further , and a positive feedback loop is formed , which can lead to a rapid runaway in the temperature and magnetic flux propagation .    in superconducting films placed in perpendicular magnetic fields ,",
    "the nonlocal electrodynamics complicates the theoretical description of the instability .",
    "thus , an analytical treatment was largely delayed compared to the bulk case , and in particular , the conditions for instability onset , and the origin of a fingering nature of the avalanches in the film case were explained only relatively recently.@xcite to follow the complete time evolution of dendritic avalanches , including the cascades of branching events , only numerical simulations have proved successful and indeed produced very realistic results.@xcite however , so far little work has been done to systematically characterize these patterns , and to our knowledge , no effort was made trying to identify how various physical parameters influence the morphology of the avalanches .",
    "such characterization is not readily done experimentally since in practice it is difficult to vary the material parameters independently .",
    "hence , the most feasible way to make a systematic investigation is to carry out a numerical simulation study . in this paper we present results of such a systematic study of the morphology of dendritic flux patterns resulting from the thermomagnetic instability in superconducting films .",
    "first , we identify the dimensionless parameters that enter the governing equations .",
    "then , avalanches are nucleated at an edge , where partially penetrated critical - states serve as initial conditions , and we follow the avalanche evolution until it ends in a frozen flux pattern . the final patterns created using different parameter values",
    "are compared , analyzed quantitatively and discussed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section ii describes the model and introduces the key dimensionless parameters .",
    "section iii reports and discusses the results of our simulations where those parameters are systematically varied .",
    "in addition , the dependence of the avalanche patters on the initial critical - state is investigated .",
    "the results are summarized in sec .",
    "consider a long superconducting strip of half - width @xmath3 and thickness @xmath4 , in thermal contact with a substrate , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in the numerical simulations",
    "the following strategy is used : starting from a zero - field - cooled strip , we slowly ramp ( increase ) the applied magnetic field @xmath5 , while the thermal feedback is turned off .",
    "this ensures that the flux penetration is gradual and the temperature is everywhere equal to the substrate temperature @xmath6 .",
    "the spatial distributions of flux density @xmath7 and sheet current @xmath8 develop in agreement with the critical state model for the transverse geometry.@xcite the field ramp is stopped when the flux penetration reaches the depth , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , and that state is taken as initial condition for the upcoming avalanche .",
    "the thermal feedback is then turned on , and a heat pulse is applied to a small region near the edge , thus triggering the instability .",
    "the same protocol is repeated using different sample parameters , and for each run we analyze the size and morphology of the flux distribution frozen in the superconductor after the avalanche .     and half - width @xmath3 , is in thermal contact with a substrate . over a region of width @xmath9 near both edges a critical state with sheet current @xmath11 and flux density @xmath7 exists as a hot - spot ( red dot ) is introduced to trigger an avalanche . [ fig1 ] ]    before describing the physical model in detail ,",
    "let us introduce the units that will be used .",
    "time is expressed in units of @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the vacuum magnetic permeability and @xmath14 is the normal - state resistivity of the superconductor .",
    "the sheet current @xmath8 and magnetic field @xmath15 are both expressed in units of the zero - temperature critical sheet current , @xmath16 .",
    "the temperature @xmath17 is normalized to the critical value @xmath18 , and the spatial coordinates @xmath19 are in units of @xmath3 .",
    "consequently , the faraday law , @xmath20 , implies that the electric field @xmath21 is normalized by @xmath22 .",
    "we consider a superconductor described by a non - retarded relationship between the electrical field and the current density as follows:@xcite @xmath23 here @xmath24 while @xmath25 is the creep exponent .",
    "the temperature dependencies of @xmath25 and @xmath26 are taken as@xcite @xmath27    the thermal properties of the superconducting film are specified by the temperature dependence of the specific heat @xmath28 , thermal conductivity @xmath29 , and the coefficient of heat removal to the substrate @xmath30 .",
    "we use here an approximation applied successfully in previous modelling work , namely that all three parameters have cubic @xmath17-dependencies.@xcite    based on this , the evolution of the local temperature is described by the dimensionless diffusion equation , @xmath31 where @xmath6 is the normalized substrate temperature .",
    "the coefficients @xmath32 are also dimensionless , and involve @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 evaluated at @xmath18 .",
    "the parameter @xmath33 has the meaning of a normalized coefficient of thermal diffusion , and characterizes the smearing of @xmath17 due to heat conduction within the film .",
    "the @xmath34 characterizes the heat flow to the substrate , while @xmath35 measures the positive feedback due to joule heating .",
    "for @xmath36 the evolution of the magnetic flux and temperature distributions are decoupled and the film is always thermomagnetically stable .",
    "note that in this representation the parameter space is significantly reduced compared to the dimensional description , since all the @xmath37 , and @xmath14 have been combined into three dimensionless parameters .    to calculate the electromagnetic behavior we express the sheet current through the local magnetization , @xmath38 , as @xmath39 outside the sample , @xmath38 vanishes by definition . in an infinite or periodic space ,",

    "is found from the faraday law in combination with the material law , eq .  .",
    "outside , @xmath44 is found implicitly by an iterative scheme requiring that @xmath45 .",
    "more details about the simulation procedure are found in ref .  .",
    "the sample occupies a @xmath46 square , with periodic boundary conditions in one direction .",
    "the other direction is extended with extra space in order to take into account the magnetic field outside the strip .",
    "the total area of the simulation covers a rectangle of size @xmath47 , which is discretized on a @xmath48 equidistant grid .",
    "the simulations were carried out using @xmath49 , and the creep exponent was set to @xmath50 .",
    "the initial state was prepared with a ramp rate of @xmath51 , and the hot spot triggering the avalanche had a size of @xmath52 ( a cross consisting of 5 grid points ) and a temperature of @xmath53 . during the avalanche",
    "the field ramp was stopped .",
    "the parameter space in these simulations is three - dimensional , and we present and discuss first the various types of flux patterns produced with @xmath54 , i.e. , keeping a fixed coefficient of heat transfer to the substrate .",
    "the initial flux penetration depth was @xmath55 when a hot spot was introduced to trigger an avalanche .",
    "figure  2 displays a collection of final - state flux avalanche patterns obtained using values for @xmath33 and @xmath35 in the range @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "evidently , within this part of parameter space one finds patterns which show striking similarities with those observed in experiments.@xcite in addition , we find some type of patterns not previously reported .",
    "the figure shows that with an increasing joule heating , @xmath35 , and a constant @xmath33 , the avalanches quickly become larger in size and get more and more branches . at the same time",
    ", the branch width remains essentially the same , although for increasing @xmath35 the main trunk near the edge gets steadily wider .",
    "when instead keeping @xmath35 constant and increasing the in - plane heat diffusion , @xmath33 , one sees that the number of branches decreases significantly . at the same time",
    ", the overall avalanche size is not varying much . at maximum value ,",
    "@xmath58 , the avalanches can hardly be characterized as dendritic , but rather as a soft protrusion .",
    "such non - dendritic shapes is a consequence of the thermal diffusion being almost as fast as the electromagnetic propagation .",
    "the simulated @xmath7-maps reveal also several other interesting features .",
    "one is that one never finds branching to take place inside the critical - state region near the edge .",
    "another is that even in the largest avalanches , the branches rarely propagate past the sample center .",
    "furthermore , branches never overlap , thus appearing to repel each other .",
    "yet another is that the inner part of the branches most often has the highest flux density , but in some cases they show a dark low-@xmath7 core .",
    "note also that the flux density is always reduced in the avalanche trunk as well as outside the sample , next to the root location .",
    "all these features correspond very well with experimental observations using magneto - optical imaging , thus demonstrating a detailed correspondence between our simulations and reality .",
    "avalanche size in units of @xmath59 as a function of @xmath35 for different @xmath33 .",
    "the data are extracted from the flux patterns displayed in the panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : morph1 ] . ]    a feature seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : morph1 ] which so far was not reported neither from experiments nor from previous simulations , is the appearance of quasi - periodic side branches in the panels with small @xmath33 .",
    "the origin of these branches is not yet clear , but a similar phenomenon is known from other systems , e.g. , formation of dendrites in crystal growth.@xcite    the panels in the upper left corner of fig .",
    "[ fig : morph1 ] , corresponding to small @xmath35 and large @xmath33 , do not show any visible trace of avalanche activity .",
    "this indicates the existence of a region in parameter space where the system is stable towards even large perturbations , such as local heating above @xmath18 .",
    "hence , a guiding line for design of , e.g. , superconducting power - devices is to make materials and dimensions such that @xmath35 is small and @xmath33 is large .",
    "note that the transition between stable and unstable behavior is a crossover rather than a sharp phase boundary .",
    "average branch width in units of @xmath3 as function of @xmath33 for various @xmath35 , extracted from the flux patterns shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : morph1 ] . ]    finally , note also that the flux structures in fig .",
    "[ fig : morph1 ] are more symmetric and with straighter branches than the avalanche structures reported from previous simulation work using the same formalism.@xcite this difference is due to the fact that in previous work static disorder was introduced in the critical current density whereas here the sample was perfectly uniform . regarding the role of disorder we therefore conclude that ( i ) branching flux patterns may appear even in uniform materials , in agreement with theoretical predictions of the fingering instability in a uniform system.@xcite ( ii ) it is the non - linear and nonlocal electrodynamics , rather than spatial disorder , that is responsible for the branching of the flux structures .",
    "( iii ) the presence of disorder affects the exact path along which the hot branches propagate .",
    "straight main branches with quasi - periodic side branches in a uniform sample become wiggly and lose periodicity in a disordered sample .",
    "( iv ) figure  [ fig : morph1 ] shows no sign of symmetric bifurcations , suggesting that the process of symmetric tip splitting found in ref .",
    "is also driven by disorder .",
    "avalanche flux patterns @xmath7 obtained for various @xmath60 , keeping constant @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "these panels show only the lower half of the strip . ]     for avalanches nucleated at different critical - state penetration depths @xmath64 , 0.1 , 0.2 , and 0.3 , with @xmath61 , @xmath65 and @xmath62 .",
    "[ fig : vary - l ] ]    as a quantitative measure of the effect of varying @xmath35 and @xmath33 , fig .",
    "[ fig : area ] shows the total avalanche size , taken as the area of the meissner state region invaded by flux , plotted as a function of @xmath35 for various @xmath33 . in spite that @xmath33 spans 4 decades",
    "the graphs are not very different and increase almost linearly with the same slope .",
    "evidently , the joule heating parameter @xmath35 is a crucially important for the impact of an avalanche .    presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : finger ] is the average branch width plotted as a function of @xmath33 for various @xmath35 .",
    "the width is evaluated by dividing the area of the avalanche by the length of the contour of @xmath66 around the structure .",
    "the figure shows that the width grows rapidly with increasing @xmath33 , and is quite weakly depending on @xmath35 .",
    "this suggests that the width of the individual branches in the dendritic structure to a large extent is controlled by thermal diffusion .",
    "consider next how the avalanche morphology is influenced by varying the heat transfer to the substrate characterized by the parameter @xmath60 .",
    "figure  [ fig : vary - beta ] illustrates the variety of flux patterns obtained for @xmath60 ranging from 0.1 to 100 , while keeping constant the parameters @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "it is evident that an increase in @xmath60 leads to avalanches of smaller overall size and thinner branches , and to some extent , also less degree of branching .",
    "the behavior can be understood from the role of @xmath60 in the heat diffusion equation , eq .  .",
    "during an avalanche the term proportional to @xmath60 represents a heat - sink that stabilizes the runaway and thus tend to terminate the avalanche.@xcite a large heat sink effect is also expected to give thinner branches .",
    "finally , we consider how the avalanches depend on the penetration depth , @xmath9 , of the critical - state background flux distribution . shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vary - l ] are four images of the strip where @xmath9 varies from 0.04 to 0.3 while @xmath33 , @xmath60 and @xmath35 are kept constant .",
    "one sees that large @xmath9 also gives large avalanches and many branches .",
    "this results is in agreement with previous experiment by bolz et al.@xcite    the images seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : vary - l ] show also a striking resemblance with previous experimental and simulation results at different substrate temperatures @xmath6.@xcite",
    "the results of this work suggests that the increasing avalanche size with @xmath6 is not because the avalanche propagation is sensitive to @xmath6 , but rather because it is sensitive to the flux penetration depth prior to the avalanches , which increases with @xmath6 .",
    "in this work we have used numerical simulations to investigate how the dimensionless material parameters affect the size and morphologies of dendritic flux avalanches in superconducting films .",
    "the avalanches were nucleated at the edge of a strip by a heat pulse and by varying the parameters we have reproduced a wide range of morphologies previously seen experimentally .",
    "we find that increasing the normalized coefficient of heat diffusion @xmath33 gives fewer and wider branches while strong heat removal to the substrate , quantified by @xmath60 , cause smaller total avalanche size and thinner branches .",
    "increasing values for the joule heating parameter @xmath35 gives more branches and larger avalanches .",
    "parameter combinations with large @xmath33 and small @xmath35 proved to be stable towards large perturbations .",
    "quasi - periodic side branches were seen in the dendritic structures with small @xmath33 , and their existence was attributed to the absence of spatial disorder .",
    "finally , we found that the avalanche morphology is sensitive to the initial critical state before the avalanche , namely , deeper initial penetration gives larger and more branching avalanches .    for future work , it will be of interest to use the present dimensionless description to study how the linear stability diagram of superconductors is affected by varying the parameters @xmath33 , @xmath60 , and @xmath35 .",
