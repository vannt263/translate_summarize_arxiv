    "the recent results from rhic ( see e.g. @xcite ) have attracted renewed interest in better understanding the dynamics of particle production , not only in nuclear collisions .",

    "the recent results of the brahms experiment @xcite put into question the successful description of ref.@xcite and show that the dpm type approaches seems more correct . in the light of the brahms experiment",
    "is becomes obvious that the large rapidity regions have more complicated flavour structure .",
    "the pure gluonic mechanisms , if at all , can be dominant only at midrapidities although the charged kaons @xcite show that even this is doubtful .",
    "similarly also the thermal models have difficulties to describe the ( pseudo)rapidity dependence of particle to antiparticle ratios @xcite and have to limit to the midrapidity only . in principle , the dynamics in nucleus - nucleus collision is fairly complicated and requires a separate analysis . in",

    "the gluon - gluon fusion is expected to be the dominant process at midrapidities and at asymptotically large energies .",
    "it is not clear how large the energy should be to validate this thesis .",
    "the physics in the fragmentation region is somewhat different .",
    "it was suggested long ago @xcite that pions in the fragmentation region are correlated with the valence quark distributions in hadrons .",
    "the standard hadronization approaches are based rather on the 2 @xmath4 2 partonic subprocesses which constitute only a part of the dynamics .",
    "the perturbative component of these hybrid models has a flavour structure as dictated by the quark / antiquark distributions . on the other hand ,",
    "the flavour structure of the remaining soft component is not so explicit .",
    "furthermore the partition into `` soft '' and `` hard '' components is somewhat arbitrary , being to some extend rather an artifact of a natural failure in applying the ( 2 @xmath4 2 ) pqcd at low transverse momenta of hadrons than a clear border of the two regions .    in this paper",
    "i discuss the relation between unintegrated gluon distributions in hadrons and the inclusive momentum distribution of particles produced in hadronic collisions .",
    "the results obtained with different unintegrated gluon distributions presented recently in the literature are shown and compared . in the present study i limit to the nucleon - nucleon collisions only and leave the nucleus - nucleus collisions for a separate analysis .",

    "we try to follow this reasonable methodology also for jet and particle production .",

    "search for the unintegrated gluon distribution in the nucleon was a subject of active both theoretical and phenomenological research in recent years .",
    "still at present the unintegrated gluon distributions are rather poorly known .",
    "the main reason of the difficulties is the fact that the unintegrated gluon distribution is a quantity which depends on at least two variables ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) in a nontrivial and a priori unknown way .",
    "another difficulty is in an unambiguous separation of perturbative and nonperturbative regions . in general different",

    "it is not completely clear to me how the experimental data in @xcite should be interpreted .",
    "i assume that the experimental data should be interpreted as : @xmath155 we have taken @xmath156 ( -2.5,2.5 ) .",
    "the simple hadronization functions , called model i and ii above , correctly fit low @xmath130 data and fail in the large @xmath130 region .",
    "this is due to lack of qcd evolution @xcite .",
    "the results obtained with fragmentation functions from @xcite which include dglap evolution , extremely well describe the large @xmath130 data .",
    "having in mind the ambiguity of the experimental data interpretation , the kl gluon distribution does a fairly good job .    in fig.[fig :",
    "pt_glue ] i compare the theoretical transverse momentum distributions of charged pions obtained with different gluon distributions with the ua1 collaboration data @xcite .",
    "the best agreement is obtained with the karzeev - levin gluon distribution .",
    "the distribution with the gbw model is much too steep in comparison to experimental data .",
    "this is probably due to neglecting qcd evolution .    _ , width=302",
    "i have calculated the inclusive distributions of gluons and associated charged pions in the nucleon - nucleon collisions through the @xmath157 mechanism in the @xmath158-factorization approach .",
    "the results for several unintegrated gluon distributions proposed recently in the literature have been compared .",
    "the results , especially transverse momentum distributions , obtained with different models of unintegrated gluon distributions differ considerably .",
    "a special attention has been devoted to the gluon distribution proposed recently by kharzeev and levin to describe charged particle production in relativistic heavy - ion collisions . in the first step i have tested the gluon distribution in electron deep - inelastic scattering at small bjorken @xmath9 .",
    "a rather good description of the hera data can be obtained by adjusting a normalization constant . in the next step",
    "so - fixed gluon distribution has been used to calculate ( pseudo)rapidity and transverse momentum distribution of gluonic jets and charged particles .",
    "some approximations used recently in the literature have been discussed .",
    "contrary to a recent claim in ref.@xcite , we have found that the gluonic mechanism discussed does not describe the inclusive spectra of charged particles in the fragmentation region , i.e. in the region of large ( pseudo)rapidities for any unintegrated gluon distribution from the literature .",
    "clearly the gluonic mechanism is not the only one and other mechanisms ( see e.g.@xcite ) neglected in @xcite must be added .",
    "some of them have been estimated with the help of the hijing code , giving a right order of magnitude for the missing strength .",
    "since the mechanism considered is not complete , it is not possible at present to precisely verify different models of unintegrated gluon distributions .",
    "the existing gluon distributions lead to the contributions which almost exhaust the strength at midrapidities and leave room for other mechanisms in the fragmentation regions .",
    "it seems that a measurement of transverse momentum distributions of particles at rhic should be helpful to test better different unintegrated gluon distributions . a good identification of particles is required to verify the other mechanisms .",
    "in contrast to standard integrated gluon distributions , the extraction of unintegrated gluon distribution from experimental data seems a rather difficult task . at present",
    ", one can rather test different unintegrated gluon distributions based on different models existing in the literature . in the present analysis",
    "i have discussed whether the production of particles can provide some information on unintegrated gluon distributions in the nucleon .",
    "there are many other reactions where this is possible , to mention here only heavy quark or jet production in @xmath123 and @xmath159 collisions .",
    "going to more exclusive measurements seems indispensable .",
    "an example is a careful study of jet correlation in photon - proton @xcite and nucleon - nucleon @xcite collisions . in my opinion",
    ", we are at the beginning of the long way to extract gluon or more generally parton unintegrated distributions .",
