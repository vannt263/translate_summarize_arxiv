    "white dwarfs ( wds ) , the final stage of stellar evolution for the vast majority of stars , exhibit a menagerie of spectral characteristics .",
    "this is somewhat surprising at first , as the extreme surface gravities of wds should chemically stratify their atmospheres on astronomically short timescales ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the origins of the spectral species of wds are thought to be either a result of the final stages of stellar evolution , such as a late thermal pulse exhausting the residual hydrogen in a star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or as a result of physical processes along the wd cooling track , such as convective mixing and accretion .",
    "an understanding of these origins is crucial for many areas of astrophysical interest , such as the cooling rates ( and therefore age - dating ) of wd populations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the fates of planetary systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and physical processes during the post main - sequence evolution of stars .",
    "using spectral data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , @xcite identified eighteen wds of spectral class dq whose spectra exhibit lines of neutral and/or ionized atomic carbon , while the majority of dq wds have spectral features indicative of molecular carbon , such as swan bands .",
    "a few years later , another dq wd with features of atomic carbon was discovered in the field of the young open star cluster @xcite .",
    "both papers suggest that these wds had helium - dominated atmospheres with traces of carbon sufficient to mask the helium spectral features .",
    "shortly thereafter , @xcite recognized that , instead , these  hot dq \" wds ( @xmath7 k ) have carbon - dominated atmospheres , with carbon abundances @xmath8 .",
    "the origin of these carbon - dominated atmospheres in a relatively small temperature range is difficult to explain .",
    "@xcite propose a spectral evolution scenario , expanded upon by evolutionary calculations of @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "a hot wd undergoes a vigorous very late thermal pulse that reduces the residual he content of the star to @xmath9 . immediately following the very late thermal pulse",
    ", the wd would look like the very hot , carbon / oxygen - rich wd .",
    "the residual helium would then rise to the surface of the wd , causing it to evolve to spectral type db ( helium - atmosphere ) , until a convective zone mixes this helium veneer back into the carbon - rich lower atmosphere at roughly the temperature where the hot dqs appear .",
    "alternatively , hot dq wds could be remnants of the so - called  super - agb \" stars , stars massive enough to ignite carbon , resulting in an oxygen - neon wd surrounded by a layer of carbon and oxygen ; @xcite predict that such a star could have no residual hydrogen and little , if any , residual helium .",
    "this latter scenario requires that all hot dq wds should be massive ( @xmath10 ) , while the former scenario allows for lower - mass hot dq stars .",
    "wd asteroseismology is a well - established method for studying the parameters and interior structures of wds , provided non - radial pulsations are present and can be detected .",
    "simple arguments involving the thermal timescale at the base of the convection zone led @xcite to suspect that some hot dqs might be unstable to non - radial pulsations , and observations inspired by this possibility led to the discovery of variations in the hot dq ( hereafter sdss j1426@xmath115652 ) .",
    "nearly simultaneous with the publication of this discovery , published a prediction based on detailed nonadiabatic calculations that hot dqs may be unstable to nonradial pulsations if sufficient helium is present in the atmosphere .",
    "subsequently , published nonadiabatic pulsation analysis of hot dqs based on their hot dq evolutionary models .",
    "crucially , all three of these pulsational stability analyses present significantly different predictions of the location of the hot dq instability strip in @xmath12  and @xmath13  space .",
    "observations of variable hot dqs have uncovered additional mysteries about these stars .",
    "the folded pulse shape of sdss j1426@xmath115752 differs significantly from those of pulsating da and db stars @xcite , and the star s spectrum shows zeeman splitting indicative of a strong magnetic field ( @xmath14 mg , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . following the discovery of variability in sdss j1426@xmath115752 , @xcite detected variability in two additional hot dq stars , ( hereafter sdss j2200@xmath150741 ) and ( hereafter sdss j2348@xmath150942 ) .",
    "they claim both variable hot dqs have pulse shapes similar to sdss j1426@xmath115752 .",
    "additional observations of these two stars by @xcite agree with @xcite that sdss j2200@xmath150741 has a pulse shape similar to sdss j1426@xmath115752 , but they find that sdss j2348@xmath150942 has a pulse shape more typical of other classes of pulsating wds .",
    "this , combined with suggestions of zeeman splitting in the spectrum of sdss j2200@xmath150741 , leads @xcite to suggest that sdss j2200@xmath150741 also has a strong magnetic field , while sdss j2348@xmath150942 does not .",
    "@xcite announced the discovery of the dqv ( hereafter sdss j1337@xmath150026 ) .",
    "this star has low - amplitude ( @xmath16 ) photometric variations and has a strongly non - sinusoidal pulse shape @xcite .",
    "while their low - resolution , high signal - to - noise spectrum shows no evidence for zeeman splitting , a higher - resolution spectrum shows clear zeeman splitting ( p.  dufour , in preparation ) .",
    "could this star have a magnetic field strong enough to distort the pulse shape ( by whatever physical mechanism ) , yet be weak enough to not cause noticeable zeeman splitting in low - resolution spectra ? or is there no relation between magnetism and the pulse shape ?",
    "more recently , @xcite discovered variablility in yet another hot dq , ( sdss j1153@xmath110056 ) , based on variable photon flux rates in the fuv spectrum obtained by the cosmic origins spectrograph on the hubble space telescope .",
    "these observations were not long enough to establish a pulse shape for this object .",
    "most of these studies have been conducted under the presumption that the variability in dqvs is due to nonradial pulsations .",
    "in addition to initial models suggesting that dqvs may be unstable to such pulsations , claims have been made of the detection of additional modes of variability not harmonically related to the dominant mode @xcite .",
    "if confirmed , these additional modes would be evidence in favor of pulsations .",
    "however , other mechanisms for variability have been postulated , including the musings of @xcite of accretion of carbon - rich material in an am cvn - like system and the hypothesis floated by @xcite that the oscillations could be analogous to those observed in rapidly - oscillating ap stars .",
    "other potential causes could include short - period binary orbits or rapid rotation of these white dwarfs .",
    "we discuss these possibilities more thoroughly in section  [ sec.discuss ] .",
    "the growing number of variable hot dq wds should help to address many of the conundrums surrounding these objects .",
    "in particular , mapping the hot dq instability strip can test the three independent predictions of pulsational properties and stability .",
    "additional pulse profiles can test whether the pulse shapes of variable hot dqs are influenced by the presence or absence of a magnetic field .",
    "finally , additional variables will help to define further the emerging characteristics of this enigmatic class of variable star .    in this paper",

    ", the most likely explanation is that the magnetic field is sufficiently strong to push some of the lines in the paschen - back regime where the position and strength of spectral features differ to that predicted by simple zeeman calculations .    indeed ,",

    "under such circumstances , the energy levels and line strength values due to the magnetic field perturbation must thus be obtained by the diagonalization of a set of matrices for each of the transitions included in our synthetic spectra .",

    "nist atomic spectra database energy levels were used as input for the pb calculations , though the line strengths of each transition are obtained by re - normalizing appropriately the sum of all the @xmath88 of a given multiplet taken from the vald database .",
    "term of the multiplet near 4775 .",
    "dotted lines show the energy level as a function of magnetic field strength assuming zeeman splitting while the full line is the result of the calculations in the paschen - back regime ( see text ) .",
    "[ fig.split ] ]    our final grid of synthetic spectra is calculated with a mean magnetic field of 3 mg based on the separation of the 5380  lines , which are transitions between @xmath89 terms that are correctly described with the zeeman regime .",
    "since the positions of the lines are correctly reproduced in the zeeman regime , it was unnecessary to perform the lengthy pb calculation for helium for this exploratory analysis .",
    "finally , we note that our line list contained a few semi - forbidden transitions that violate the selection rules ( @xmath90 and/or @xmath91 ) .",
    "the pb formalism described above can not be used for these lines and a more general approach needs to be implemented in that case .",
    "unfortunately , the relevant data necessary for such calculations are currently unavailable .",
    "we thus simply modeled those transitions assuming normal zeeman splitting patterns , an approximation that does not correctly represent the positions and strength of such lines ( see , for example , tick marks in figure [ fig.specfit ] ) .",
    "we attempted to fit the spectra using the usual non - linear least square routines commonly used in spectral fitting , but these led to regions of parameter space that made little sense .",
    "for example , a fit might converge successfully on a minimum @xmath92 , but visual inspection would reveal obvious shortcomings such as not reproducing the 4471   dip , not matching the slope , or matching the strengths and positions of one group of lines while another set was poorly fit . it is likely that the models do not perfectly reproduce reality because of the numerous approximations , and some badly reproduced regions ( such as the group of lines near 4340  that are always too strong , the semi - forbidden transitions , etc . ) are simply pulling the solution away from realistic values .",
    "even when we fixed @xmath13and @xmath12 , the carbon abundance would wander to unrealistic values that resulted in obvious visual mismatches .",
    "we therefore resorted to visual inspection for selecting the best model .",
    "another difficulty is the strong group of lines near 4340 .",
    "choices of parameters that fit this complex well result in very poor fits for the rest of the spectrum ; there is no combination of parameters in our model grid that can achieve a satisfactory fit over all spectral region simultaneously .",
    "this could imply that our numerous approximations affect the temperature structure in such a way to poorly reproduce this complex or perhaps that the @xmath88 values for these lines are incorrect .",
    "our visual inspection therefore starts with the lines near 4267 . since this is an ionized feature , it provides decent constraints on @xmath12 .",
    "we then use the broad 4471  dip as a main indicator of carbon abundances , as this dip proves quite sensitive to @xmath93 . in parallel , the mmt and sdss spectra include the 5876  line , which we used as a confirmation of the abundance .",
    "this line also allows some of the coolest solutions to be rejected .",
    "our best solution , shown in figure [ fig.specfit ] , has @xmath94 k , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 .",
    "the solutions are degenerate ; similar quality solutions can be found by compensating a downward change in @xmath12with downward changes in @xmath13and @xmath97 .",
    "we estimate our correlated uncertainties in these parameters as follows . a @xmath98k change in our best solution s @xmath12resulted in a @xmath99dex change in @xmath97 , with a lower @xmath12resulting in less carbon and vice - versa .",
    "a change in @xmath13has little effect on the carbon abundance as long as we stay close to @xmath100 ; at 15500k and @xmath101 , @xmath93 is only 0.2 dex higher . at @xmath102 ,",
    "the carbon abundance increases by about 0.7 dex as compared to @xmath95 .",
    "even though @xmath95 provides the most appealing solution visually , given all the approximations and the preliminary nature of our calculations , our value of @xmath103 should not be considered a precision measurement .",
    "much more work is needed before we can confidently determine the mass of this object .",
    "carbon - rich solutions , favored for hot dqs , do not fit well .",
    "however , we can impose some useful additional constraints on these parameters .",
    "for instance , we compared the sdss photometry of sdss j1036 + 6522with synthetic photometry calculated by folding the model spectra through filter response curves .",
    "the photometric data ( figure [ fig.photcomp ] ) seem to favor a solution in the @xmath104 k range , a temperature range which is corroborated by the 5876  line , although the unknown reddening makes this a bit uncertain .",
    "this conclusion also supports the qualitative best matching model above .",
    "based on the spectroscopic and photometric analysis , sdss j1036 + 6522seems to be an intermediate object between the classical , cool dq stars ( @xmath105 k , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and hot dq stars ( @xmath106 k , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "its high carbon abundance also seems to make it akin to the second sequence of carbon - rich cool dqs @xcite and two dqs with similar temperature , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in addition , the high magnetic field of the star also appears to be a typical characteristic of many of the hot dqs @xcite .",
    "although the high apparent surface gravity should be considered preliminary , a growing body of evidence suggests that hot dqs and the carbon - rich sequence of cool dqs are massive wds .",
    "this evidence includes unpublished parallaxes of g35@xmath1526 and g227@xmath155 ( * ? ? ?",
    "dahn , private communication ) ; the high mass of the carbon- and oxygen - rich post - agb star h1504 + 65 ; the presence of a hot dq in the open star cluster , in which the da cluster member wds are all massive @xcite ; and improved spectroscopic observations and model atmospheres of hot dqs , which favor high surface gravities ( dufour et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "we note however that these calculations are done with classical approximations for the stark broadening of lines , so the high gravity solution should be considered highly uncertain .",
    "state - of - the - art stark broadening parameters for similar to that calculated for in @xcite are unfortunately not available yet .    in summary ,",
    "sdss j1036 + 6522is most probably a cooler version of and ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and/or a hotter version of g227@xmath155 and g35@xmath1526 .",
    "+ 6522could thus be a transition object between the coolest carbon - rich hot dqs and the hottest , cool helium - rich dq white dwarfs .",
    "there is thus growing evidence that this class of wds indeed forms a distinct and fairly continuous evolutionary sequence of massive hydrogen- and helium - deficient stars , as proposed by @xcite .",
    "further analysis on this type of object will require improved models including various magnetic field geometries , solving the radiative transfer equation for all stokes parameters ( spectropolarimetric observations would be especially useful to test the eventual predictions from such models ) , and inclusion of state - of - the - art stark broadening parameters for once available .",
    "the detection of variability in sdss j1036 + 6522increases yet again the number of known dqvs .",
    "however , the spectroscopic analysis raises the question of whether or not sdss j1036 + 6522belongs in the same class as the other known dqvs .",
    "there are some crucial differences between sdss j1036 + 6522and the hot dqvs , first and foremost being @xmath12 , with sdss j1036 + 6522being significantly cooler than the other dqvs , as discussed above .",
    "second , the atmospheric composition of sdss j1036 + 6522is different than both the hot and cool dqs .",
    "hot dqs are carbon - dominated , with @xmath107 , and he usually undetected @xcite . in the  second - sequence \" cool dqs , @xmath108 @xcite .",
    "again , sdss j1036 + 6522is intermediate , with @xmath109 .",
    "this observation furthers the hypothesis that sdss j1036 + 6522is a transition object between hot and cool dqs .",
    "we now explore the interpretations and implications of this conclusion .      from an observational standpoint , the photometric variability of sdss j1036 + 6522is very similar to the other known dqvs .",
    "these similar characteristics include the period and amplitude of the photometric variability , the dominance of a single frequency in the discrete fourier transform , and the stability of the frequency and phase .",
    "based on the time - series photometry , sdss j1036 + 6522looks and acts like the other members of the dqv class of objects . naively combining this information with the spectroscopic evidence that this star belongs to the same evolutionary sequence and object class as the hot dqvs",
    ", we would come to the conclusion that sdss j1036 + 6522is a typical dqv and is variable for the same reason as the others , whatever that reason may be .",
    "the difficulties arise when we attempt to explain the origin of the photometric variations .",
    "as described in the introduction , the preferred explanation for the variability in dqvs has been nonradial pulsations . even though there are differing physical mechanisms and different predicted instability strips for pulsations in dqvs , sdss j1036 + 6522is far cooler than _ any _ of these predictions ( though we note that these models do not include a significant magnetic field ) .",
    "moreover , if our atmospheric analysis is correct , the atmosphere of sdss j1036 + 6522is helium dominated and @xmath110 k cooler than the coolest observed dbv ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite hypothesize that the periodic photometric variability could be due to an accreting system akin to high - accretion states of systems .",
    "this speculation was based solely on the observed pulse shape of sdss j1426 + 5752 .",
    "this hypothesis now appears highly unlikely .",
    "high signal - to - noise spectra of dqvs show no signs of accretion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , radial - velocity variations have not been detected with cataclysmic - variable - like periods ( * ? ? ? * although orbital periods commensurate with the photometric period have not yet been ruled out ) , and no low - accretion state systems analogues have been identified .",
    "given that sdss j1036 + 6522has a sinusoidal pulse shape , we find no evidence that sdss j1036 + 6522is an interacting binary system .",
    "another possibility , discussed by @xcite , is that this star is a wd analogue of rapidly oscillating ap ( roap ) stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "given the presence of a strong magnetic field , this oblique pulsator model seems to be a distinct possibility .",
    "it is also plausible that sdss j1036 + 6522is a rapidly rotating wd , with the photometric variations due to the presence of a persistent spot , although several arguments could be made against this interpretation .",
    "accreting magnetic objects such as am her systems show photometric modulation due in part to the rotation of the wd carrying the accretion column in and out of view , but sdss j1036 + 6522shows no evidence of accretion .",
    "in addition , the measured rotation periods of single magnetic wds are on the order of hours and days to centuries @xcite , significantly longer than the photometric period of sdss j1036 + 6522 .",
    "as the measured rotation rates of other classes of isolated pulsating wds are also on the order of hours to days , the rotation hypothesis would require sdss j1036 + 6522to be an outlier among single wds .",
    "time - resolved spectropolarimetry may be able to determine if sdss j1036 + 6522is rapidly rotating .    at present , it is unclear what the cause of the photometric variability in sdss j1036 + 6522is , or even if the variability has the same cause as for the hot dqvs .",
    "typically , large amplitude dav and dbv pulsators tend to have relatively non - linear ( non - sinusoidal ) pulse shapes , while low - amplitude pulsators tend to be more sinusoidal .",
    "this relation does not appear to hold among the known dqvs with sufficient data to calculate pulse shapes . in the prototype dqv sdss j1426@xmath115752 ,",
    "the amplitude of the first harmonic ( 6.7 mma ) is less than half that of the fundamental ( 17.5 mma ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while in the much lower amplitude dqv sdss j2200@xmath150741 , the first harmonic is similar in amplitude to the fundamental frequency at @xmath111 mma @xcite .",
    "these significant harmonics and their phases result in decidedly non - sinusoidal , boxy pulse shapes with long brightness maxima and short , narrow minima , the opposite to the pulse shapes found in the high amplitude davs and dbvs @xcite .",
    "however , the similar - amplitude dqv sdss j2348@xmath150943 ( @xmath112 mma ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is sinusoidal , and the low - amplitude dqv sdss 1337@xmath150026 ( @xmath113 mma * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has a very non - sinusoidal pulse shape .",
    "further , the three dqvs with non - sinusoidal pulse shapes all have detectable magnetic fields , while the sinusoidal sdss j2348@xmath150943 does not .",
    "this has led to the suggestion by @xcite that the magnetic field may be responsible for the non - linearities observed in many dqvs .",
    "the folded pulse shape of sdss j1036 + 6522appears to be sinusoidal .",
    "this qualitative statement is reinforced quantitatively by the lack of any observed harmonics in the dft .",
    "as sdss j1036 + 6522is strongly magnetic yet has a sinusoidal pulse shape ( within the limits of existing data ) , it is clear that strong magnetic fields in dqvs do not always cause boxy pulse shapes .",
    "strong magnetic fields in sdss j1337@xmath150026 , sdss j1426@xmath115752 and sdss j2200@xmath150741 may well be the cause of their unique pulse shapes , but sdss j1036 + 6522shows that a sinusoidal pulse shape in a dqv does not indicate the absence of a strong magnetic field , at least assuming that the mechanism behind the variability is the same for sdss j1036 + 6522and the hotter dqvs .",
    "@xcite claim that variability was not detected in several hot dqs , as well as that those stars would not be expected to vary given their @xmath12and @xmath13and given predictions for an instability strip . in light of the low amplitude of variability in sdss j1036 + 6522and sdss j1337 - 0026 @xcite and the typical detection threshold of @xmath114 mma in the data obtained for @xcite , we feel compelled to mention that many of the stars not observed to vary could in fact be variable at the same level as sdss j1036 + 6522 .",
    "photometric precision of equal to or better than 1 mma would be required to rule out sdss j1036 + 6522-like variability .",
    "therefore , we feel that the claims of non - detection of variability in @xcite should be viewed with the caveat that these limits are not very significant . as @xcite detect uv variability in four out of five target hot dqs , it could be that most or all hot dqs are in fact dqvs . a re - analysis of the time - series data for stars not observed",
    "to vary is underway , and more stringent limits on non - detections of variability will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "these limits will also be crucial for testing competing models for these stars , such as the different proposed instability strips discussed in the introduction .",
    "in summary , we present spectroscopy and time - series photometry of the white dwarf sdss j1036 + 6522 .",
    "our analyses lead us to the following conclusions :    * sdss j1036 + 6522is photometrically variable with a period of 1115.64751(67 ) s and an amplitude of @xmath1 .",
    "the period , amplitude , and phase of the modulations are constant within measurement errors over at least a 16 month interval .",
    "* sdss j1036 + 6522has an effective temperature and carbon abundance located between the hot and cool dqs , suggesting that it is a transition object between those two populations of white dwarfs . *",
    "the star is magnetic , with a field strength of @xmath85 mg . *",
    "the lack of observed harmonics suggest that the photometric modulation is nearly sinusoidal .",
    "if the cause of the photometric modulation is the same mechanism as in the hot dqvs , then the absence or strength of the star s magnetic field is not necessarily correlated with the pulse shape . *",
    "the mechanism of the photometric modulation in sdss j1036 + 6522is unclear .",
    "there is no evidence for accretion , the effective temperature is significantly cooler than pulsation models predict , and the photometric period is significantly shorter than the typical isolated white dwarf rotational period .",
    "* photometric variability is common among hot dq white dwarfs , but the low optical amplitudes of many known dqvs imply that non - detections of variability in any hot dq are only significant if photometric precision is high ( @xmath115 ) .",
