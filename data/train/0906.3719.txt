    "in this short note we will investigate a possible scenario for the crossover transition of a gas of hadrons at vanishing baryochemical potential ( for a detailed description we suggest the reader to refer to  @xcite ) .",
    "following the ideas proposed in  @xcite , we adopt the philosophy that the same partition function should describe the system at both low and high temperature . to this end",
    "we describe hadrons as extended bags of quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) in order to embody confined and deconfined phases from the very beginning . accordingly",
    "( as derived in the simplest formulation of the mit bag model  @xcite ) , we start by assuming a hadron mass spectrum of the hagedorn s type @xmath0 . to model the transition , however , we need to add some additional dynamics .",
    "we found that a qualitatively good agreement with lattice qcd ( lqcd ) can be obtained by simply taking into account the elastic interactions between hadrons together with excluded volume corrections .",
    "the elastic interactions give rise to a _",
    "kinetic _ pressure @xmath1 that in turn tends to `` squeeze '' the bag - like hadrons , resulting in a generalized temperature - dependent mass spectrum .",
    "the stability condition for the existence of a bag is given by the pressure balance : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the internal pressure of the bag , b is the bag constant and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the system volume and temperature , respectively . in our simple scheme ,",
    "we adopt boltzmann statistics and a non - relativistic framework , which is a good approximation in the vicinity of the transition region  @xcite .    in order to calculate the partition function of the system",
    ", one needs to evaluate the internal bags pressure @xmath3 in eq .",
    "( [ simplass ] ) that depends on the kinetic pressure @xmath1 .",
    "because the pressure @xmath1 is thermally generated , it must be calculated from the partition function itself , resulting in a self - consistency relation .",
    "the behavior of the system depends on the value of the parameter @xmath6 of the mass spectrum .",
    "for @xmath7 it exhibits a first order phase transition , whereas for @xmath8 the transition becomes a sharp crossover .",
    "here , we analyze in detail the case of a crossover transition , i.e. @xmath8 . as an example we show the ratios @xmath9 ( fig .",
    "( [ isob2]a ) ) and @xmath10 ( fig .",
    "( [ isob2]b ) ) , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the energy and the entropy density , respectively . as one can see from ( fig .",
    "( [ isob2]b ) ) , for @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the curves grow with the temperature with larger slopes for smaller @xmath6 s . instead , for @xmath15",
    ", they settle onto constant asymptotic values in a qualitatively good agreement with lqcd .",
    "as @xmath6 changes from @xmath16 to @xmath17 the asymptotic value converges very fast to the stefan - boltzmann limit from above   deviation of the lqcd result from the free gas ( stefan - boltzmann ) limit  @xcite . ] .        in ref .",
    "@xcite , we also studied the ratios @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "also these quantities exhibit a similar behavior . in the range @xmath15 , the model seems to produce a smooth crossover transition toward a new regime whose features are very similar to those of a gas of massless particles , even though no deconfined states are included in the partition function .",
    "we have also studied the ( strong ) dependence of the particle density @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 ) on @xmath6 .",
    "we have found that there exist a limiting value @xmath22 between @xmath23 and @xmath24 such that for @xmath25 the particle density vanishes at high temperature .",
    "the system is then populated by one ( or few ) infinite bag(s ) that occupies the entire volume .",
    "conversely , for @xmath26 , @xmath27 grows with the temperature . in the range @xmath28 , the ideal gas behavior is mimicked by a number of heavy extended bags that saturate the phase space forming a dense system",
