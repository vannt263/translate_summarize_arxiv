    "compared to the previous bon instrument used for past surveys ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",

    "* cognard  2011 and guillemot  2012 ) ) the bandwidth is increased by a factor of 4 .",

    "the targeted field of view ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 for @xmath4 square degrees ) consists of a grid of @xmath5 18-min pointings recorded with a 64 @xmath2s time resolution with 1024 channels over the 512 mhz bandwidth .",

    "2 different schemes are considered , both using the presto package :    * a quicklook pipeline that reduces the original time resolution by a factor of 4 is used on site and is able to keep up with the data acquisition .",
    "no acceleration search is performed at this stage . * to search the full - resolution data with acceleration , we are currently implementing a new pipeline to run at the in2p3 computing center developed originally for the ongoing palfa survey . to remain sensitive to very short orbital period binaries",
    ", we also split the observations in half and analyze each separately before combining results . in the light of the recent discoveries of highly dispersed radio bursts ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "about 860 of the 5800 planned pointings have been made ( 15% of the @xmath4 square degrees of this survey ) and completion is expected by 2013 with the discovery of 10 to 30 new sources according to population models @xcite .",
