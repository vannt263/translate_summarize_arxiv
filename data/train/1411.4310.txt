    "the equilibrium vertical gas distribution in a galaxy is determined by the balance between the vertical pressure gradients and the net gravitational potential of the galaxy .",

    "further , since the hi  disc generally extends to galacto - centric radii where the gravity due to stars is negligible , both the flaring of the hi  disc as well as its rotational velocity can be used as diagnostic probes of the underlying potential of the dark matter halo ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "while modelling of the vertical distribution of the gas can be used to infer the properties of the dark matter distribution , comparison of models with observations is complicated by the following problem .",
    "the hi  disc scale - height can be constrained from observations of edge on galaxies .",
    "in such a situation it is however difficult to measure the gas velocity dispersion @xmath9 , which is a critical parameter for the model .",
    "@xcite show that the uncertainty in @xmath9 is an important contributor to the uncertainty in the scale - height computed from the model .",
    "the calculated hi  scale - height is highly sensitive to the assumed value of @xmath9 ; a 10% change in @xmath9 can lead to @xmath10 15% change in the calculated hi  scale - height .",
    "while @xmath11 can be measured for face on galaxies , in such cases it is diffuclt to directly measure the scale - height .",
    "the fact that it is difficult to simultaneously measure both the scale - height and the velocity dispersion makes it difficult to build completely data driven models of the vertical distribution of the hi",
    ".    in this paper we use gmrt observations of the dwarf irregular galaxy kk250 to model the scale - height of the hi  distribution .",
    "the dark matter halo is assumed to be spherically symmetric and its parameters are fixed from modelling of the observed rotation curve . unlike the earlier studies , we do not assume a fixed value for the gas velocity dispersion , but instead allow it to be a free parameter in the fitting .",
    "we pick the model that best fits the observed vertical hi  distribution .",
    "although the observed velocity widths were not used as an input to the model , we also compare the observed line of sight profiles with the model ones , to check for consistency .",
    "the rest of this paper is arranged as follows . in  2 , we present the hi  data , in  3 the modelling procedure .  4",
    "contains a comparison of the model with the observational data , and a discussion of the results .",
    "kk250 was observed as part of the faint irregular gmrt galaxy survey ( figgs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . throughout this paper",
    "we assume a distance of 5.9   mpc to the galaxy @xcite . at this distance ,",
    "an angular separation of 1@xmath12 corresponds to a linear separation of 1.7  kpc .",
    "the observations , data analysis as well as the rotation curve and mass decomposition for this galaxy are presented in @xcite .",
    "the galaxy is close to edge - on , meaning that a circular beam gives far fewer independent measurements along the minor axis than the major axis . in this paper",
    "we are interested in modeling the scale - height of the hi .",
    "we would hence like to have as good a resolution as possible along the minor axis .",
    "the hybrid configuration of the gmrt @xcite allows one to use a single gmrt observation to make images at a range of angular resolutions ( varying from @xmath13 for data from the central square antennas alone to @xmath14 for data from the full array ) .",
    "however , the signal to noise ratio at the higher resolutions is generally modest . to get an optimum between the angular resolution along the minor axis and the signal to noise ratio",
    ", we choose to image the galaxy with an elliptical beam , with the major axis of the ellipse aligned with the major axis of the galaxy .",
    "we used the task uvsrt in aips to rotate the visibility data so that the major and minor axis of the beam are aligned with the galaxy axes .",
    "the desired ellipticity of the beam can then be obtained using the uvtaper parameters to the aips task imagr . for the analysis below ,",
    "the images were made with a synthesized beam having full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of 32@xmath15  13@xmath16 ( or 0.91  kpc @xmath17 0.37  kpc ) .",
    "the resulting image is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mom0 ] , along with the hi  intensity profile at two different galacto - centric radii .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     as discussed above , since the hi  is optically thin , the observed vertical distribution of the hi  reflects the scale - height distribution of all of the gas along the line of sight . if the scale - height does not vary with radius then the observed vertical distribution can be used to determine the intrinsic scale - height of the gas .",
    "if the scale - height varies with radius then determination of the true scale - height from the observed vertical distribution is not so straight forward . in the current case ,",
    "since we have modelled the galaxy , we can use the model to determine how the scale - height varies with radius . in fig .",
    "[ fig : scl_obs ] ( left panel ) , we plot the calculated model scale - height ( defined as the hwhm of the model hi  vertical density profile ) versus @xmath18 for the best - fit @xmath9 profile . as can be seen the hwhm varies significantly with galacto - centric radius . at @xmath18 @xmath10 0 , the hwhm is @xmath10 700  pc , it drops to a minimum value of @xmath10 350 pc at @xmath18 = 1  kpc .",
    "this is similar to both the scale - length of the stellar disc , as well as the spatial resolution of the data along the galaxy major axis . beyond 1  kpc the gas disc flares by almost a factor of 2 by @xmath18 = 4 kpc .",
    "hi  flaring in the outer parts of galaxies is a common phenomenon and can be attributed to the decreasing importance of the self gravity of the disc components ( see for example the study by * ? ? ?",
    "however the large hwhm seen in the central regions of the galaxy is unusual . to understand this better",
    ", it is useful to look at the radial variation of the velocity dispersion in our best fit model . in fig .",
    "4 ( right panel ) , we plot our best - fit @xmath9 versus @xmath18 along with a double - gaussian fit to the same .",
    "the velocity dispersion at the center of the galaxy is @xmath1  kms@xmath2and it falls steeply to a value of 8 kms@xmath2by @xmath18 @xmath10  1  kpc , which is equal to one exponential stellar disc scale - length @xmath19 .",
    "the earlier studies @xcite of the scale - height in dwarf galaxies assumed a constant velocity dispersion of @xmath20  kms@xmath2 . in figure",
    "[ fig : obs ] we show the hwhm derived from a model in which we have assumed @xmath20  kms@xmath2 .",
    "as can be seen , this provides a poor fit to the data in the central regions of the galaxy . clearly the high velocity dispersion in the best fit model",
    "is driven by the fact that the observed hwhm is roughly constant towards the center of the galaxy , while the vertical gravitational force gets larger as one approaches the galaxy center .",
    "the decrease in velocity dispersion as one goes from the center to the edge of the disc in kk250 is also consistent with earlier results that in most galaxies the velocity dispersion either remains constant or decreases with radius @xcite .",
    "our inferred value of @xmath9 of 22 kms@xmath2at the centre of galaxy is however somewhat high compared to the typical values obtained from other studies of dwarf galaxies . for e.g. @xcite find @xmath9 @xmath10 10 kms@xmath2for galaxies in the little things survey and @xcite obtain values @xmath10 6 - 12 kms@xmath2for the dwarf irregulars in the local group .",
    "we note however that apart from the center most region , the velocity dispersion in kk250 is similar to the values reported in these other works .",
    "one of the input parameters to our model was the mass distribution as derived from the rotation curve by @xcite . in that paper the asymmetric drift correction ( viz .",
    "the correction for the support against collapse provided by the pressure gradient in the gas ) was derived by assuming the velocity dispersion to have a constant value of 8 kms@xmath2 .",
    "since the value we get near the centre of the galaxy is somewhat higher , we recalculated the asymmetric drift - corrected rotation curve using the velocity dispersion as estimated here .",
    "the corrected curve lies within the error bars of the original rotation curve of @xcite , which justifies the use of the mass decomposition derived in that paper .",
    "what is the origin of the velocity dispersion that we observe ?",
    "the one dimension thermal velocity dispersion associated with 8000  k gas ( i.e. a reasonable upper limit to the kinetic temperature of the warm neutral medium ) is @xmath3  kms@xmath2 .",
    "so while it is possible that the velocity dispersion that we see in the outer parts of the galaxy are entirely due to thermal motions of the particles , in central regions there must be an extra contribution due to small scale bulk motions of the gas .",
    "velocity spreads in excess of thermal in the neutral ism are often attributed to turbulence . in the case of dwarf galaxies ,",
    "further evindence for the exisitence of turbulence in the atomic ism comes from studies of the power spectrum of the hi  intensity fluctuations @xcite .",
    "turbulence in the atomic gas in galaxies can arise from energy input from star formation and supernovae explosions @xcite , magneto - rotational instabilities ( mri ) in differentially rotating discs , @xcite , gravitational instabilities @xcite and mass accretion @xcite .",
    "kk250 has a linearly rising rotation curve , and hence the magneto - rotational instability does not appear to be relevant here .",
    "kk250 has a nearby companion dwarf galaxy , kk251 , and tidal interaction could be a possible reason for the increased velocity dispersion .",
    "however , the hi  distributions of kk250 and kk251 show no obvious sign of interaction or disturbance , and the rotation curves of the galaxies also appear fairly regular @xcite .",
    "it is hence appears that tidal interactions may not be playing an important role in this system .",
    "which , if any , of the remaining mechanisms are responsible for driving turbulence in dwarf irregulars is currently unclear ( see for e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "+ regardless of the origin of the velocity dispersion , the fact that the estimated velocity dispersion in dwarfs is comparable to that in much larger spiral galaxies will have consequences for the structures of the gaseous discs in dwarfs",
    ". the larger ratio of @xmath21 in dwarfs will lead to their gas discs being thicker that those of spiral galaxies .",
    "indeed , the typical hwhm for the hi  that we determine for kk250 is significantly larger than the value of @xmath8pc determined for the inner disc of the milky way @xcite .",
    "similarly large scale - heights for dwarf galaxies have also been indicated by studies of the power spectrum of the hi  intensity fluctuations @xcite .",
    "these results are based on the expectation that the slope of the power spectrum will change on scales comparable to the scale - height of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "finally , studies of the axial ratio distribution of the gas and stellar discs of dwarf galaxies @xcite do indeed show that their stellar and gaseous discs are significantly thicker than those of spirals .",
    "the more diffuse gas distribution has several implications for galaxy evolution , including being likely to be one of the causes for the observed low efficiency of conversion of stars to gas in dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "we use gmrt hi  21 cm observations of the dwarf irregular galaxy kk250 to model the vertical distribution of the atomic gas .",
    "our model consists of a 2-component galactic disc model of gravitationally - coupled stars and gas in the force field of a dark matter halo .",
    "the dark matter halo parameters are derived from fitting to the observed rotation curve .",
    "we allow the velocity dispersion of the gas to be a free parameter in the model , and constrain it using the observed half width half maximum of the vertical distribution of the hi .",
    "for the best fit model we also compare the observed line of sight velocity widths with the model ones , and find the two to be in good agreement .",
    "this provides a further consistency check to the derived velocity dispersion . from our best fit model , we find that the velocity dispersion is maximum at the center , but rapidly falls to a value of @xmath3  kms@xmath2at @xmath22  kpc .",
    "this is similar to both the scale - length of the stellar disc , as well as the spatial resolution along the radial direction .",
    "the intrinsic hi  scale - height also reaches its minimum value at @xmath22  kpc .",
    "the scale - height that we measure for kk250 is significantly larger than the scale - height of the hi  in the central regions of the milk way , consistent with earlier observations that dwarf galaxies have significantly thicker gas discs than typical spiral galaxies .",
