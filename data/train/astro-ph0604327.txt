    "recent measurements of distant supernovae ( snia ) @xcite as well as current measurements of cosmic microwave background anisotropies @xcite favor a spatially flat universe filled by cold dark mater ( cdm ) @xcite and a dark energy component of unknown origin @xcite , which can be modelled as a perfect fluid with energy density @xmath0 and pressure @xmath1 violating the strong energy condition @xmath2 . the combination of cmb and snia data with other orthogonal measurements , as the hst determination of the hubble parameter , constrain the universe to be almost flat even if we consider the time variation of dark energy equation of state @xcite .",
    "all these models explaining current acceleration of the universe in terms of smoothly distributed and slowly varying ` dark energy ' are formulated in the context of the standard cosmological picture based on general relativity theory .",
    "possible types of explanation include a cosmological constant @xmath3 @xcite , an evolving scalar field ( quintessence ) @xcite , the phantom energy @xcite in which a weak energy condition is violated , models filled with chaplygin gas @xcite , models with dynamical coefficient equation of state @xmath4 ( decaying vacuum energy density ) , usually parameterized by the scale factor @xmath5 or redshift @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , fluid which describe quantum effects coming from massless scalar field ( the casimir effect ) @xcite , the noninteracting chaplygin gas and baryonic matter @xcite . in table  [ tab:1 ] we collected the ten candidates for dark energy description together with their friedmann first integral @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the hubble function , and @xmath10 is the curvature index ) .",
    "for all these approaches some hypothetical dark energy component is postulated which satisfies the conservation condition @xmath11 for both standard dust matter as well as dark energy @xmath12 separately .",
    ".the hubble function for 10 prototypes of cosmological models explaining the present acceleration of the universe in terms of dark energy [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "main aim of the paper was exploring the bayesian framework of model selection into discussion which cosmological model describe present accelerating phase expansion of the universe . in principle there are two types of explanation why current universe is accelerating . in the first group",
    "it is postulated existence of perfect fluid which violate the strong energy condition .",
    "the nature ( lagrangian ) of such matter called dark energy is unknown although the cosmological constant is the most popular candidate for dark energy description .",
    "the second group of explanations is based on hypothesis that dark energy could actually be the manifestation of a modification to the friedmann equation arising from ` new physics ' ( e.g. extra dimensions , generalized general relativity , etc . ) . calculating the corrections to the standard frw equation we can explore the phenomenology and different evolutional scenarios .",
    "therefore there is no single hypothesis , instead there are several well - supported hypotheses ( i.e. dark energy models ) that are being entertained .",
    "it is just realization of concept of ` multiple working hypotheses ' advocated by chamberlin @xcite . in tables",
    "[ tab:1 ] and [ tab:2 ] we completed the 20 models in two classes which cover both types of explanation of acceleration of the universe .",
    "then we adopt the model selection methods to obtain ` strength of evidence ' comparison and ranking of candidate hypotheses of dark energy . providing quantitative information to judge",
    "the ` strength of evidence ' is a key point of ranking models .",
    "the hypothesis testing ( which only provides qualitative information significant vs. nonsignificant ) is particularly limited in the model selection ( for discussion of the likelihood based strength of evidence see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .      1 .",
    "while the aic recommended dark energy models which belong to the set @xmath13 the bayes factor is more restrictive because recommended models which are elements of subset @xmath14 .",
    "this is due to different values of the coefficient in the definition of aic and bic quantities , so called penalty term for more complex models . in the aic definition",
    "this coefficient is always equal @xmath15 whereas in the bic definition it depends on simple size ( here it is nearly equal @xmath16 ) .",
    "analogous recommendation can be performed for the class of models with a modified friedmann equation , namely the aic recommends a set of models @xmath17 and the bayes factor favors class of models @xmath18 which has non - empty intersection with models recommended by the aic .",
    "3 .   one can construct also ranking within the best models in each category i and ii by aic and bayes factor respectively .",
    "then we obtain a set of models recommended by the aic @xmath19 and by the bayes factor @xmath20 .",
    "+ note that both quantities pointed out that model with noninteracting chaplygin gas and baryonic matter is the best one from both sets of models under consideration .",
    "this is due to more a priori information about this model which we include in calculation .",
    "two model parameters were fixed here : @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in situation",
    "when both parameters are fitted the conclusion is changed . all additional information which we include in calculation are necessary and can change our final inference .",
    "+ it should be point out that dark energy models better explain snia data than models with a modified friedmann equation .",
    "4 .   we can perform ranking of the models within ` brane paradigm ' and then we obtain models @xmath23 recommended by the aic and model @xmath24 preferred by the bayes factor . 5 .",
    "one can conclude that the flat @xmath3cdm model ( model indexed by @xmath25 ) has still substantial support with respect to better models .",
    "note that the aic indicates that there is no difference between the @xmath3cdm @xmath26 model and the @xmath3cdm @xmath27 model ( indexed by @xmath15 ) , both of them fit the data equally well .",
    "whereas the bayes factor denotes that there is an evidence against model @xmath15 with respect to model @xmath25 .",
    "+ note that bayes factor indicates that the flat @xmath3cdm model better explains snia data than models gathered in table ii . 6 .   for completeness",
    "we calculate posterior probability which measures probability for the model being the best one among the class of models under consideration ( being the most favored model by data in hand )",
    ". then one can observe how prior believe about model probability change after inclusion data to analysis ( see tables [ tab:5 ] , [ tab:6 ] , [ tab:7 ] , [ tab:8 ] ) .",
    "note that for all models recommended by the bic posterior probability is greater than the prior one , whereas for models which do not belong to a preferred set of models the posterior is smaller than the prior .",
    "authors are grateful to dr w. godlowski for fruitful discussion and the participants of the seminar on observational cosmology for comments .",
    "we also thank an anonymous referee for suggested improvements to this paper and additional references ."
