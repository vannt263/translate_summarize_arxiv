    "charged objects are ubiquitous in colloidal domain and electrostatic interactions have been widely employed in colloidal assembly .",
    "predominantly spherical colloidal particles have been studied , while comparatively little work has been devoted to the behaviour of anisotropic charged composite objects in a solution .",
    "the spherical shape is , however , more an exception than a rule in the colloidal realm , and from the fundamental point of view , understanding the mechanisms directing the assembly of anisotropic charged colloids is at least equally important .",
    "moreover , it enables design of novel ordered micro- and nanostructures .",
    "experimentally , patterned substrates are typically created by either optical manipulation @xcite or surface deposition @xcite .",
    "multiple charged spherical colloids can then be confined within the traps and if the number of colloids @xmath0 is an integer of the number of traps @xmath1 , at strong enough confinement , monodisperse clusters or `` colloidal molecules '' ( in general anisotropic , at least for small @xmath2 ) constituted of @xmath3 colloids are confined to each of the traps .",
    "the coupling between the anisotropy of the charged `` molecules '' and screening by microions in the solution is surprisingly nontrivial @xcite .",
    "the multipole moments generated by the molecular anisotropy are all screened in a similar fashion , so that inter - molecular interactions feature non trivial angular dependence affecting the symmetry of the ordering in a subtle way .",
    "therefore , at large enough electrostatic interactions , orientationally ordered `` colloidal molecular crystals '' are formed .",
    "crystals with remarkably rich variety of orientational ordering have been observed @xcite . in the case of like - charged repulsive colloids the molecular size is determined by the interplay between the electrostatic repulsion and the confinement forces , while the intermolecular electrostatic interactions determine the type of rotational ordering of the molecules .",
    "the ground state behaviour of such colloidal molecular crystals has been explored in several studies @xcite , however , in order to assess their thermal stability the complete phase behaviour needs to be explored . in @xcite molecular dynamics simulations",
    "have been performed showing the generic phase behaviour of colloidal molecular crystals ( @xmath4 and 4 ) on square and triangular periodic substrates .",
    "a two - stage melting has been reported where first the orientational and then the positional order vanishes .",
    "similarly , in an experiment @xcite laser induced freezing and melting has been observed : upon increasing the confinement strength colloidal trimers confined to triangular lattice went through a transition from liquid to crystal and back to modulated liquid .",
    "here , we focused on colloidal dimers ( @xmath5 ) on two - dimensional square periodic substrates and performed parallel tempering monte carlo simulations to study the melting process in detail .",
    "we defined appropriate order parameters describing the two - stage melting and characterized the order - disorder transition for both , the orientational and positional correlations .",
    "it turns out that the orientational melting is a second order phase transition with diverging specific heat at the transition temperature , while the decay of the positional order is not a phase transition but rather a gradual crossover - type transition .",

    "the microions neutralize the total charge and mediate repulsive screened coulomb interactions among the colloids .",
    "we assume the pairwise additive yukawa potentials and do not consider many - body contributions to the electrostatic interactions because the geometry of the problem and the typical screening parameters explored are in the regime where pairwise additivity is an excellent assumption @xcite .",

    "the unit of length @xmath15 is the inter trap distance ( see fig .",

    "each trap is occupied by exactly 2 colloids forming an elongated colloidal dimer . due to the dimer - dimer electrostatic interactions ,",
    "the dimers order into orientationally ordered colloidal molecular crystals . upon raising the temperature first the orientational order of the dimers decays and eventually it becomes possible for single colloids to hop between the traps thus destroying the dimers and forming a modulated liquid state .",
    "we used parallel tempering monte carlo ( ptmc ) simulations to simulate @xmath19 replicas of the system , each in the canonical ensemble , at temperatures @xmath20 ranging from @xmath21 to @xmath22 allowing for configurational swaps between systems with adjacent temperatures @xcite ( we chose a geometric temperature profile , thus @xmath23 ) .",
    "apart from single colloid moves and configurational swaps we also implemented dimer rotations that become important at low temperatures .",

    "we have roughly estimated and highlighted the many - body dominated region with dark grey shading in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "most of the non - af phases we discussed above ( including those reported in literature @xcite where the parameters were @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) are in or close to this region , which means that their stability would need to be re - assessed by applying the many - body poisson - boltzmann theory .",
    "the behaviour in this regime is definitely interesting , however it is experimentally difficult to access and was not the focus of our present study .",
    "we would also like to stress that in a large part of the parameter space where the confinement is relatively weak the size of the `` molecules '' in the traps is significant with respect to the lattice spacing and the notion of molecule becomes obscure .",

    "the value of @xmath63 is zero indicating orientationally disordered configuration and it starts increasing upon lowering the temperature below @xmath51 .",

    "scaling ( see the supplementary material ) of the two transition temperatures we conclude that both , @xmath51 and @xmath91 are finite in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "to summarize , we present ( fig.[fig9 ] ) phase diagrams showing both transition temperatures versus @xmath17 at fixed confinement strength and versus @xmath16 at fixed @xmath17 .",
    "the crossover transition @xmath51 has been somewhat arbitrary defined as the temperature at which the positional melting starts and the value of the order parameter @xmath49 drops from 1 to @xmath92 . on the other hand , @xmath91 was extracted as the point of the steepest decrease of the orientational order parameter @xmath83 exactly matching the position of the diverging peak in the specific heat @xmath90 ( fig.[fig7 ] ) . with increasing screening strength @xmath17 ,",
    "both critical temperatures decrease ( see left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) .",
    "this is due to weaker inter - trap interactions that directly control orientational ordering ( @xmath91 ) and also , in addition to trapping forces , average distances between the dimers , which affects positional ordering ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "increasing @xmath16 has a similar effect on @xmath91 ( see middle and right panels in fig . [ fig9 ] ) since larger @xmath16 means smaller dimers and hence weaker inter - trap forces . on the contrary ,",
    "positional order is of course stronger at larger @xmath16 , therefore higher temperatures are needed to destroy it . at large enough values of @xmath17 and @xmath16 we observe the two - stage melting with the phase transition from ordered solid to partially ordered solid ( without orientational order ) and the crossover melting of the positional order from partially ordered solid to modulated liquid .",
    "interestingly , at longer screening lengths ( smaller @xmath17 ) and weaker confinement the crossover transition disappears and the ordered solid melts directly into a modulated liquid via a second order phase transition .",

    "the screening lengths considered in our work ( @xmath93 ) are much shorter than in @xcite ( @xmath40 ) , therefore the phase diagrams in fig.[fig9 ] are shifted to lower values of the confinement @xmath16 as compared to fig.4 in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "spin models were constructed to analytically describe orientational ordering of colloidal molecules on periodic lattices .",
    "remarkably , their analytically obtained orientational melting transition for trimers on triangular lattice coincides with the corresponding transition for dimers on square lattices in @xcite .",
    "crystaline structures of dimers on triangular lattice were also examined in @xcite showing interesting transitions between herringbone , ferromagnetic , `` japanese  6  in  1 '' , paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic ordering .",
    "however , several approximations had to be made in order to reduce the colloidal system to a potts - like model : they assumed rigid dimers placed on the lattice points interacting with nearest neighbours only and restricted to discrete orientations compatible with the lattice symmetry .",
    "in @xcite we have already discussed that the discrete angle approximation does not apply to the experimental system of colloids trapped by laser tweezers .",
    "further to that , while the nearest neighbour approximation seems well justified for triangular lattices , it is qualitatively wrong on square substrates @xcite , therefore it seems difficult to extend the conclusions of @xcite to colloidal systems and to square - like patterned substrates .",
