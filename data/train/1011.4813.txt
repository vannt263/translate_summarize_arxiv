    "conformally invariant @xmath1-models with superspace target play a prominent role in various branches of mathematical physics . in the context of condensed matter theory they arise as means for an effective description of disordered systems",
    "they are also an essential ingredient in the covariant quantisation of superstrings , especially in backgrounds involving ramond - ramond fields @xcite . in this context one of the main applications",
    "concerns the ads / cft correspondence where @xmath1-models on supersymmetric versions of @xmath2 and related spaces are used to describe the string theory side of the duality @xcite .",
    "the string background @xmath3 with pure neveu - schwarz flux can be formulated in terms of a wzw model on the supergroup @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "in such a formulation one can describe deformations corresponding to switching on a mixture of neveu - schwarz and ramond - ramond fluxes which preserves the full isometry of @xmath4 . using @xmath5 as an abbreviation for the supergroup @xmath4",
    ", the isometry is @xmath6 . in the lagrangian description",
    "the term describing such a deformation is the kinetic term of the wzw theory : @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to an operator in the wzw theory which can be written as @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 are the left and right wzw currents and @xmath11 is the full primary field corresponding to the adjoint representation of the supergroup @xmath5 .",
    "the presence of the field @xmath12 ensures that the perturbation is invariant under the full isometry @xmath6 .",
    "it compensates the non - trivial transformation behaviour of @xmath13 under left multiplication and of @xmath14 under right multiplication by elements from @xmath5 .",
    "the perturbing field is exactly marginal due to the remarkable fact that the supergroup @xmath4 has a vanishing killing form .",
    "the vanishing of the killing form in particular implies that the casimir element is trivial in the adjoint representation and hence that the field @xmath12 has zero conformal dimension .",
    "the deformation above is described geometrically as a principal chiral model on the supergroup @xmath5 with a wess - zumino term .",
    "it was first argued in @xcite that such principal chiral models ( in the absence of a wess - zumino term ) are conformal when the supergroup has a vanishing killing form .",
    "the focus of that paper was on the particular series of supergroups : @xmath15 which includes the @xmath4 case .",
    "the considerations of @xcite were further extended to general supergroups with vanishing killing form and to their cosets in @xcite ( see also @xcite for more specific models ) .",
    "another interesting deformation of the @xmath4 wzw theory is realised by the perturbing operator @xmath16 .",
    "such deformations are exactly marginal again due to the vanishing of the killing form .",
    "however , they preserve only the diagonal part of the global symmetry group .",
    "their global symmetry is thus isomorphic to one copy of @xmath5 . as in the previous kind of deformation we expect a string theory interpretation in terms of a non - trivial background with mixtures of rr and ns flux .",
    "although it is straightforward to compute the metric and @xmath17-field in the deformed sigma model , the extraction of physical background fields requires more work and the corresponding calculations have not been carried out so far .",
    "both of the deformations above easily generalise to wzw theories on arbitrary supergroups with vanishing killing form .",
    "these theories are typically logarithmic , admitting the existence of fields with zero conformal dimension besides the identity . for the supergroups with trivial killing form one of these operators",
    "is the adjoint representation primary field @xmath11 .",
    "supergroup wzw theories are well understood , at least at the conceptual level @xcite . even though the logarithmic structure leads to many complications",
    ", the models can be solved due to the existence of two copies of an affine kac - moody superalgebra symmetry .",
    "the latter are realised in terms of two current algebras , one being holomorphic , the other anti - holomorphic .    for supergroups with vanishing killing form , deformed by one of the two types of deformations",
    "described above , the global symmetry also implies the existence of conserved currents , however now with a much more complicated operator product expansion .",
    "in particular , the conserved local currents no longer split into a holomorphic and an antiholomorphic component which are separately conserved .",
    "these statements are well - known for conserved currents belonging to global symmetries in massive theories .",
    "the general structure of the operator product algebra generated by conserved currents in massive 2d theories was first considered in @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated in @xcite that for the massive @xmath18 @xmath1-models the ope algebra of conserved currents allows one to construct an infinite tower of non - local conserved charges .",
    "these results were later generalised and reinterpreted in terms of yangian symmetries in @xcite . in @xcite the ope algebras generated by currents were called `` massive current algebras '' . as we will work with similar algebras in the context of conformal theories we prefer to call them `` non - chiral current algebras '' .",
    "it is well - known that the @xmath6-preserving deformations discussed above are integrable , at least on a classical level , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "our deformations are thus also very likely to be both conformal and integrable .",
    "it should be noted that the integrability is associated with the global symmetry .",
    "more precisely , it can be understood as being a consequence of current conservation and the existence of a maurer - cartan equation . while a priori there is no geometric reason to expect that the second , @xmath5-preserving , deformation considered in this note leads to an integrable theory",
    ", we will show that the algebraic structure of the theory allows one to use the construction of @xcite to obtain natural candidates for yangian charges directly at the quantum level .",
    "more technically , we argue that the quantum equation of motion for the @xmath5-preserving deformation can be rephrased as a maurer - cartan equation for the conserved current associated with the global @xmath5-symmetry .    to summarise our considerations so far",
    ", we see that there are at least two good reasons to study the non - chiral current algebras generated by the above two deformations .",
    "firstly one can use the methods of @xcite to construct an infinite tower of non - local conserved charges and to prove the integrability of such models .",
    "and secondly one may hope that such algebras will be useful for organising the spectrum of such conformal models .",
    "besides potential applications such algebras are also interesting in their own right . in particular it would be interesting to understand in detail how the conformal symmetry is interrelated with integrability .    the non - chiral current algebra for the @xmath6-preserving deformation was recently studied in @xcite . in those papers the operator product algebra of currents",
    "was investigated using perturbation theory both around the wzw point and in the classical ( large level ) limit . as a starting point",
    ", the authors postulated a quantum version of the maurer - cartan equation .",
    "furthermore an interesting bootstrap approach using the maurer - cartan equation was put forward to obtain the ope algebra of the non - chiral currents and primary fields . while very inspiring , that approach however hinges on the crucial assumption that the ope algebra of the deformed currents closes on itself .",
    "this assumption is quite strong in view of the fact that the dimension zero field @xmath11 is involved in the deformation which could appear in various combinations in the ope of the currents .",
    "we provide a quantitative discussion of this question by deriving two relations involving the operator @xmath11 that are necessary ( but maybe not sufficient ) for the closure of the current - current opes .",
    "unfortunately further analysis of this issue is stalled due to the lack of knowledge of the ope of the operator @xmath11 with itself . as this question lies outside the main scope of this paper the details of that computation",
    "are relegated to appendix [ ap : gg ] .    in the present paper",
    "we study the @xmath5-preserving current - current deformation . in this case",
    "the technical complications related to the field @xmath11 are absent and the situation is under very good control . the ope closure of the deformed currents is easily established .",
    "furthermore , despite the fact that for these deformations there is no maurer - cartan equation of geometric origin , the quantum equation of motion does take up essentially the same form ( see section [ sc : eom ] ) .",
    "we believe that this property allows one to prove the integrability of the model similarly to how it was done in @xcite for the massive models .",
    "besides having potential applications in the context of the ads / cft correspondence the @xmath5-preserving deformation is also relevant for the study of gross - neveu models with supergroup symmetries . in the case of @xmath19 the latter",
    "have been argued to be dual to @xmath20 supersphere @xmath1-models @xcite .",
    "this correspondence is very interesting from a conceptual point of view , since superspheres belong to the class of ( one - sided ) supercosets for which a genuine cft description is currently beyond reach .",
    "one would hence hope that the same type of correspondence can be established for other supercoset spaces , in particular for those appearing in the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "the main technical tool to be employed in the present paper is abelian conformal perturbation theory , used in conjunction with certain representation - theoretic assumptions valid for the supergroups of interest .",
    "the basic ideas of this method first appeared in @xcite where it was shown that two - point functions of closed string vertex operators and three - point functions of currents can be determined exactly by extrapolation from the semi - classical ( flat ) limit .",
    "the vanishing of the killing form and some classification of the low rank invariant tensors on the supergroups @xmath21 were used to argue for the absence of corrections involving the structure constants for certain correlators .",
    "one can then use the abelian conformal perturbation theory ( metric and @xmath17-field perturbations in toroidal theories ) to obtain those correlators .",
    "using essentially the same method the exact open string spectra for certain d - branes in deformed wzw theories on supergroups were obtained in @xcite ( see also @xcite for a similar calculation in a condensed matter context ) .    in the present paper",
    "we apply the same method to bulk correlation functions of currents in the current - current deformed model .",
    "we are able to determine all the two- and three - point functions of currents exactly to all orders in the deformation parameter and we calculate their ope at leading order in perturbation theory . furthermore we compute the first non - trivial terms in the inverse level expansion for a four - point function of the currents , again to all orders in the coupling constant .",
    "both the ope algebra and the four - point function of currents exhibit logarithms , just as expected for this type of theories . using the exact two- and three - point functions of the currents we compute the quantum equation of motion and the equal time commutators to all orders in the coupling constant .",
    "the equation of motion takes up the form of the maurer - cartan equation , giving strong indications for the integrability of the model following the arguments of @xcite .",
    "the main body of the paper is organised as follows . in section [ sc : defo ]",
    "we introduce supergroup wzw models and discuss the available conformal deformations in some detail . in section [ sc : twothree ]",
    "we first calculate the exact two- and three - point functions of the deformed theory .",
    "our calculation is valid to all orders in the deformation parameter and shows a non - trivial coupling between holomorphic and anti - holomorphic currents away from the wzw point . in section [ sc : opes ]",
    "we elaborate on the precise form of the full ope between the currents to lowest order in perturbation theory .",
    "we find again that the holomorphicity is spoiled and that there are logarithmic contributions in the ope between currents of opposite chirality .",
    "section [ sc : fourpt ] contains a calculation of the leading terms of the current four - point function in an expansion in @xmath0 but to all orders in the deformation parameter . in",
    "that result the logarithmic nature of the cft is clearly visible . in section [ sc : cr ] we use the exact knowledge of the singular terms in the ope of currents to compute their equal time commutators .",
    "remarkably the commutator algebra is isomorphic to the direct sum of two copies of the current algebra .",
    "this means that the phase space of the model is isomorphic to two copies of an affine kac - moody superalgebra .",
    "the equation of motion , however , exhibits significant differences from that of wzw models .",
    "it is derived in section [ sc : eom ] to all orders in the coupling constant .",
    "the appendices [ ap : conventions ] , [ ap : distributions ] , [ ap:1storder ] , and [ ap:4pt ] contain our conventions for lie superalgebras , a thorough review of the abelian conformal perturbation theory and some details of calculations which are particularly cumbersome .",
    "some technical details pertaining to our discussion of the @xmath6-preserving deformation have been put in appendix [ ap : gg ] .",
    "supergroup wzw models exhibit a number of peculiar features that their bosonic cousins are lacking .",
    "one of them is the occurrence of logarithmic correlation functions which is intimately connected to the supergeometry and the non - factorisation of the state space into left and right movers @xcite .",
    "while the presence of the logarithms is a common feature , special phenomena arise if the killing form of the underlying supergroup is vanishing @xcite . in that case the supergroup wzw model admits marginal perturbations of current - current type which would otherwise break conformal invariance . in this section",
    "we review the construction and the symmetries of wzw models and discuss different types of marginal deformations and their implications .",
    "let us fix a supergroup @xmath5 and a non - degenerate invariant form @xmath22 .",
    "we assume the supergroup to be simple and simply - connected and the invariant form to be normalised in the standard way ( see below ) .",
    "the supergroup wzw model is a two - dimensional @xmath1-model describing the propagation of strings on @xmath5 .",
    "the action functional is given by @xmath23    = -\\frac{ik}{4\\pi}\\int_\\sigma\\ ,         \\bigl\\langle g^{-1}\\partial g , g^{-1}{{\\bar{\\partial}}}g\\bigr\\rangle\\,dz\\wedge d{{\\bar{z}}}-\\frac{ik}{24\\pi}\\,\\int_b         \\bigl\\langle g^{-1}dg,[g^{-1}dg , g^{-1}dg]\\bigr\\rangle\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is a closed riemann surface and @xmath17 is a three - dimensional extension of this surface such that @xmath25 .",
    "the form @xmath22 is supposed to be normalised such that the topological wess - zumino term is well - defined up to multiples of @xmath26 as long as @xmath27 is an integer .",
    "the level @xmath27 is thus the only parameter of the model .",
    "by construction , every wzw model has a global symmetry @xmath6 corresponding to multiplying the field @xmath28 by arbitrary group elements from the left and from the right .",
    "in fact , this symmetry is elevated to an affine kac - moody algebra symmetry @xmath29 if one allows these group elements to depend holomorphically and antiholomorphically on @xmath30 , respectively . in the last formula ,",
    "the currents are defined by @xmath31 and the equations of motion guarantee that they are holomorphic and antiholomorphic , respectively .",
    "@xmath32 refers to the non - degenerate invariant form , see appendix [ ap : conventions ] for the details of our lie superalgebra conventions .",
    "supergroup wzw models are a very exciting subject by themselves but for the purpose of this paper it is not necessary to introduce further details .",
    "the interested reader is referred to @xcite where a more comprehensive discussion can be found .",
    "wzw models allow for a number of local deformations which preserve conformal invariance . on an abstract level ,",
    "such deformations have to be of the form @xmath33    = { \\mathcal{s}}^{\\text{wzw}}[g]+{\\mathcal{s}}_{\\text{def}}[g ]    \\qquad\\text { with } \\qquad    { \\mathcal{s}}_{\\text{def } }    = \\lambda\\int\\!d^2z\\,{\\mathcal{o}}_{\\text{def}}(z,{{\\bar{z}}})\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the perturbing field @xmath34 has conformal weights @xmath35 in order to render the coupling @xmath36 dimensionless .",
    "consequently , a canonical candidate for the perturbing field is an arbitrary bilinear in the currents @xmath37 and @xmath38 , e.g. @xmath39 a simple calculation , however , implies that perturbations of this form are generically marginally relevant , i.e.  that conformal invariance is spoiled at higher orders in perturbation theory . roughly speaking",
    ", marginality requires that the currents of one specific chirality which enter eq .",
    "mutually commute ( up to central terms ) .",
    "the only exception are supergroups with vanishing killing form for which also deformations induced by the perturbing field @xmath40 are marginal to all orders in perturbation theory . here",
    "@xmath41 denotes the inverse of the invariant form @xmath32 .",
    "the argument for the marginality will be reviewed below .",
    "the deformation just discussed has obvious generalisations such as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is an arbitrary ( but constant ) automorphism of @xmath5 .",
    "the insertion of the automorphism merely corresponds to a reinterpretation of the current @xmath44 and will hence not be considered in this note . on itself is replaced by an @xmath43-twisted right action of @xmath5 on itself . ]    let us now analyse what kind of symmetries are preserved by current - current perturbations . under the isometry",
    "@xmath45 the currents transform as @xmath46 this in particular implies that none of the deforming fields is invariant under the full @xmath6 symmetry . for a general matrix @xmath47 hardly any of the global symmetries will remain , even if the deformation preserves conformal invariance .",
    "the special choice for instance preserves one copy of @xmath5 and that is the maximal possible global symmetry for an ansatz of the form .",
    "the full symmetry can only be preserved if one of the currents is conjugated by group elements as in @xmath48 .",
    "symmetry is to be preserved . ] in operator language this requires the use of a non - chiral primary field @xmath11 that transforms in the representation @xmath49 with respect to the global @xmath6 symmetry @xcite .",
    "it is obvious from the construction that the resulting perturbing field @xmath50 can only be marginal if @xmath11 is a primary field with conformal dimensions @xmath51 .",
    "since the conformal dimension of @xmath11 is proportional to the quadratic casimir element @xmath52 evaluated in the adjoint representation , this is possible precisely when the underlying supergroup has a vanishing killing form .",
    "it should be noted that a composite , normal ordered operator as the one in has complicated properties and leads to a variety of subtleties in perturbation theory , even more so since it belongs to a non - unitary representation and has the same conformal dimension as the identity operator .",
    "is not part of the spectrum . a priori this makes it difficult to make sense out of correlation functions involving the field @xmath11 . ] for this reason , we restrict ourselves to pure current - current perturbations which preserve the diagonal @xmath5 symmetry .",
    "as explained above , this is the maximal symmetry which can be preserved under such circumstances .    throughout the rest of the paper",
    "we will only treat the deformation by the perturbing field . and @xmath53 are basically the same perturbing fields since they result from each other by application of the automorphism @xmath54 to one of the two currents .",
    "] more concretely , the lagrangian we are considering corresponds to the deformation @xmath55    & = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\pi k}\\int_\\sigma d^2z\\,\\bigl\\langle j,\\bar{j}\\bigr\\rangle     = -\\frac{k\\lambda}{\\pi}\\int_\\sigma d^2z\\,\\bigl\\langle\\partial     gg^{-1},g^{-1}{{\\bar{\\partial}}}g\\bigr\\rangle\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have included a convenient normalisation factor @xmath56 . from the geometrical construction",
    "it is evident that this deformation preserves the diagonal @xmath5 symmetry .",
    "conformal invariance , however , can only be checked on the level of operators . as is well known",
    ", a necessary condition for the marginality of the deformation is that the ope @xmath57 does not contain a copy of @xmath58 again @xcite .",
    "this condition arises at first order in perturbation theory .",
    "a quick calculation keeping only the relevant terms yields @xmath59    & = \\cdots-\\kappa_{ba}\\,\\kappa_{dc}\\,(-1)^{bc}\\,{f^{ac}}_e\\,{f^{bd}}_f\\,\\frac{:\\!j^e{{\\bar{j}}}^f\\!:(w,{{\\bar{w}}})}{|z - w|^2 }          + \\cdots\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the coefficient of the current bilinear @xmath60 can easily be shown to be proportional to @xmath61 . it hence vanishes for supergroups with vanishing killing form , thus proving our assertion .",
    "conformal invariance can also be shown at higher orders in perturbation theory .",
    "for that purpose we review an argument of bershadsky et al @xcite that in this or a similar form will be used frequently throughout the text .",
    "the basic idea is the following : we know that the perturbing field ( and hence also the corresponding coupling ) transforms trivially under a certain action of the supergroup @xmath5 . as a consequence",
    ", the associated @xmath62-function will also be invariant with respect to @xmath5 .",
    "let us then look at all possible feynman diagrams that can contribute to the perturbative expansion of the @xmath62-function .",
    "since the deformation can be fully expressed in terms of currents whose ope is given in , the @xmath62-function will be a sum over diagrams made up from trivalent vertices ( corresponding to the structure constants ) .",
    "these diagrams all can not have external legs since otherwise the @xmath62-function would not transform trivially under @xmath5 .",
    "let us first consider an arbitrary diagram which contains at least one trivalent vertex and let us separate it from the rest of the diagram .",
    "we now have a vertex connected by three lines to a blob containing the rest of the diagram .",
    "assuming further that the structure constants are the unique invariant rank three tensor of @xmath5 ( this is known to be true in all cases of interest @xcite ) , we conclude that the diagram is proportional to @xmath63 .",
    "this tensor is identically zero due to the vanishing of the dual coxeter number .",
    "hence only diagrams without trivalent vertices remain . under these circumstances",
    ", however , the perturbative series reduces to that of a multi - component free boson which is known to possess marginal current - current perturbations changing the respective radii . in our context",
    "this also proves conformal invariance for our deformed non - abelian model .",
    "one may wonder whether the moduli space is one - dimensional or whether one can combine two marginal deformations in order to explore additional directions .",
    "let us analyse this question by switching on an additional perturbing field of the form with automorphism @xmath54 .",
    "we focus on this choice since @xmath43 is the only automorphism available for all supergroups . denoting",
    "the second deforming operator by @xmath64 one finds @xmath65      & = \\cdots-\\kappa_{ba}\\,\\kappa_{cd}\\,(-1)^{bc}\\,{f^{ac}}_e\\,{f^{bd}}_f\\,\\frac{:\\!j^e{{\\bar{j}}}^f\\!:(w,{{\\bar{w}}})}{|z - w|^2 }            + \\cdots\\ , .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] a closer investigation shows that there is no reason for the coefficient of @xmath60 to vanish . as a result",
    "we conclude that the two deformations @xmath66 and @xmath67 are incompatible in the sense that conformal invariance is broken as soon as both fields are switched on , even though each of them preserves conformal invariance separately .",
    "this is not too surprising since the two deformations preserve different @xmath5-symmetries , hence destroying supersymmetry ( but not the bosonic symmetry ) when both couplings are non - zero .",
    "the operator formalism also allows us to verify our earlier statement that the diagonal @xmath5-symmetry is preserved .",
    "this is the case precisely when the current @xmath34 is invariant with respect to the diagonal action of @xmath5 . in algebraic terms",
    "this amounts to the statement @xmath68{\\mathcal{o}}_{\\text{def}}(w,{{\\bar{w } } } )    = 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the undeformed theory .",
    "the validity of this equation follows immediately from the opes @xmath69    { { \\bar{j}}}^a({{\\bar{z}}})\\,{\\mathcal{o}}_{\\text{def}}(w,{{\\bar{w } } } )    & = \\frac{kj^a(w)}{({{\\bar{z}}}-{{\\bar{w}}})^2 }          -\\frac{i{f^a}_{dc}:\\!j^c{{\\bar{j}}}^d\\!:(w,{{\\bar{w}}})}{{{\\bar{z}}}-{{\\bar{w}}}}\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] an argument similar to the previous one for the @xmath62-function , but now involving diagrams with precisely one external leg , can be used to show that a quantity with a single @xmath5-index does not receive corrections at higher orders in perturbation theory .",
    "hence we conclude that @xmath34 is @xmath5-invariant to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "in this section we will compute the deformed two- and three - point functions of the currents to all orders in @xmath36 . to this end",
    "we use certain algebraic properties of the supergroups at hand ( similar to the ones employed in the previous section ) combined with the abelian conformal perturbation theory of @xcite .      following",
    "@xcite we will assume that the ultraviolet limit in the deformed theory is smooth and the perturbed operators are in one - to - one correspondence with the operators at the wzw point .",
    "in particular this concerns the currents which for the deformed theory will be denoted by the same symbol but now including both holomorphic and antiholomorphic arguments : @xmath70 and @xmath71 . on general grounds we expect the deformed currents @xmath72 , @xmath73 to remain virasoro primary fields of conformal weights @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively .",
    "this is because the perturbing operator preserves the spin , the currents are conserved ( and thus their scaling dimension is one ) and there are no fields that could form a jordan block with the currents .",
    "the last statement follows from the fact that the perturbing fields are built from the currents only and thus can not generate anything but the fields in the vacuum representation of the underlying affine lie superalgebra .",
    "a general remark must be made regarding correlation functions . in a wzw theory for a supergroup the expectation value of the identity operator is typically zero : @xmath76 .",
    "this is because the identity field in such models belongs to the bottom of a jordan block ( the socle of a projective cover ) .",
    "however , this effect is absent for the free field realisations of the wzw models encountered in @xcite ( giving rise to gross - neveu models ) which allow to establish non - logarithmic theories .",
    "thus , at least in that case , the computations of correlation functions which are done below with the convention @xmath77 are fully justified . for other wzw theories on supergroups the computations below",
    "should be understood more formally as means of obtaining ope coefficients ( see section [ sc : opes ] ) .",
    "the two - point functions of currents in the deformed theory can be obtained by summing up the perturbation theory expansion : @xmath78 and analogously for the @xmath79 correlator . here and",
    "elsewhere @xmath80 stands for a wzw theory correlator .",
    "each term in the perturbation series is given in terms of integrals of correlators evaluated at the wzw point .",
    "to compute such integrals we need to have these correlators defined in the distributional sense ( and not merely as functions defined for finite separation of variables as is customarily done in cft ) .",
    "such distributional correlators in general contain contact term ambiguities related by reparameterisations of the coupling constant @xmath36 .",
    "a particular choice of these contact terms should be considered as part of the definition of the composite operator @xmath81 coupling to @xmath36 .",
    "we will fix the distributional correlators of the currents extending the prescription of @xcite . in appendix d of that paper ,",
    "g.  moore gave a prescription for partial integrals of distributions arising in conformal perturbation theory of free bosons .",
    "that prescription is easily adopted for integrals of correlators containing currents in wzw theory .",
    "moreover in appendix [ ap : distributions ] we show how one can define the correlation functions at hand as distributions so that the prescription of @xcite holds and we justify , based on that definition , various manipulations with such integrals .    specialising to a particular class of supergroups",
    "crucially simplifies summing up the perturbation series .",
    "in addition to the vanishing of the adjoint casimir element we will assume that the structure constants @xmath82 are the only invariant 3-tensor . under these assumptions",
    "the terms containing the structure constants in the perturbative series drop out @xcite . for completeness",
    "we repeat here the argument .",
    "since a simple lie superalgebra has a unique non - degenerate invariant bilinear form , the general form of the deformed correlator is @xmath83 where @xmath84 transforms trivially under the global symmetry group .",
    "thus if @xmath84 contains terms dependent on @xmath82 those terms must be of the form @xmath85 where @xmath86 is an invariant tensor .",
    "but since the only invariant 3-tensor is given by the structure constants , and since @xmath87 for the quadratic casimir of the adjoint representation , such contributions vanish .",
    "the same argument goes through for the @xmath88 correlator .",
    "the remaining perturbation series is effectively that of the free boson theory . using the results of @xcite ( see appendix [ ap : distributions ] for details )",
    "we obtain @xmath89    & &   \\bigl\\langle j^{a}(z_{1 } , \\bar z_{1 } ) \\bar j^{b}(z_{2 } , \\bar   z_{2})\\bigr\\rangle_{\\lambda }   & = 0\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the correlators are taken at finite separation .",
    "consider next the deformed three - point functions @xmath90 it was argued in @xcite that the terms in the perturbation series containing two or more factors of the structure constants vanish . for the argument of @xcite to work one needs to assume that there are only three traceless invariant tensors of rank 4 : @xmath91 any 3-tensor resulting from a contraction of more than two structure constants can be represented diagrammatically as in figure [ fig:3pt ] below .",
    "contraction of tensors for a three - point function , width=226 ]    every structure constant corresponds to a three - vertex in the diagram and any contraction to a link .",
