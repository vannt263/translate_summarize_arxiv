    "the parameter explored there is the probability that a given vertex is contained in an infinite component .",

    "@xmath0 points are sampled within a certain region of @xmath7 following a certain distribution ( most usually this is the uniform distribution or the distribution of the point - set of a poisson point process ) and any two of them are joined when their euclidean distance is smaller than some threshold which , in general , is a function of @xmath0 . in the last two decades",
    ", this kind of random graphs was studied extensively by several research groups  see the monograph of penrose  @xcite and the references therein .",
    "numerous typical properties of such random graphs have been investigated , such as the chromatic number  @xcite , hamiltonicity  @xcite etc .    from the point of view of applications , random geometric graphs on euclidean spaces",
    "have been considered as models for wireless communication networks .",
    "though the above model might seem slightly simplistic , more complicated random models have been developed which incorporate various parameters of actual wireless networks ; see for example  @xcite or  @xcite for a more sophisticated model .",
    "however , what structural characteristics emerge when one considers these points distributed on a curved space where distances are measured through some ( non - euclidean ) metric ?",
    "such a model was introduced by krioukov et al .",
    "@xcite and some typical properties of these random graphs were studied with the use of non - rigorous methods .",
    "the most common representations of the hyperbolic space is the upper - half plane representation @xmath8 as well as the poincar unit disc which is simply the open disc of radius one , that is , @xmath9 .",
    "both spaces are equipped with the hyperbolic metric ; in the former case this is @xmath10 whereas in the latter this is @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is some positive real number .",
    "it can be shown that the ( gaussian ) curvature in both cases is equal to @xmath13 and the two spaces are isometric , that is , there exists a bijection between the two spaces which preserves ( hyperbolic ) distances .",
    "in fact , there are more representations of the 2-dimensional hyperbolic space of curvature @xmath13 which are isometrically equivalent to the above two .",
    "we will denote by @xmath14 the class of these spaces .    in this paper ,",
    "following the definitions in  @xcite , we shall be using the native representation of @xmath14 . under this representation ,",
    "the ground space of @xmath15 is @xmath16 and every point @xmath17 whose polar coordinates are @xmath18 has hyperbolic distance from the origin equal to @xmath19 .",
    "also , a circle of radius @xmath19 around the origin has length equal to @xmath20 and area equal to @xmath21 .",
    "we are now ready to give the definitions of the two basic models introduced in  @xcite .",
    "consider the native representation of the hyperbolic space of curvature @xmath22 , for some @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath24  thus @xmath25 is a function of @xmath0 and in particular @xmath26 .",
    "we create a random graph by selecting randomly @xmath0 points from the disc of radius @xmath25 centred at the origin @xmath27 , which we denote by @xmath28 .",
    "the distribution of these points is as follows .",
    "assume that a random point @xmath29 has polar coordinates @xmath30 .",
    "then @xmath31 is uniformly distributed in @xmath32 $ ] , whereas the probability density function of @xmath19 , which we denote by @xmath33 , is determined by a parameter @xmath34 and is equal to @xmath35 when @xmath36 , then this is the uniform distribution .",
    "this set of points will be the vertex set of the random graph and we will be denoting this random vertex set by @xmath37",
    ". we will be also treating the vertices as points in the hyperbolic space indistinguishably .    1 .",

    "the parameter @xmath40 is interpreted as the inverse of the temperature of a fermionic system where particles correspond to edges .",
    "the distance between two points determines the field that is incurred by the pair .",
    "in particular , the field that is incurred by the pair @xmath44 is @xmath45 .",
    "an edge between two points corresponds to a particle that  occupies \" the pair . in turn , the hamiltonian of a graph @xmath46 on the @xmath0 points , assuming that their positions on @xmath28 have been realized , is @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the indicator that is equal to @xmath49 if and only if the edge between @xmath29 and @xmath42 is present .",

    "the disc model is the  frozen \" version ( @xmath97 ) of the binomial model .",
    "rigorous results for the disc model were obtained by gugelmann et al .",
    "@xcite , regarding their degree sequence as well as the clustering coefficient .",
    "we will now discuss the potential of using random graphs on spaces of negative curvature as a model for real - world networks .",
    "the typical features of real - world networks can be summarised as follows :    1 .",
    "they are _ large _ , that is , they contain thousands or millions of nodes ; 2 .",
    "they are _ sparse _ , that is , the number of their edges is proportional to the number of nodes ; 3 .",
    "they exhibit the _ small world phenomenon _ ; most pairs of vertices are within a short distance from each other ; 4 .",
    "a significant amount of _ clustering _ is present .",
    "the latter means that two nodes of the network that have a common neighbour are somewhat more likely to be connected with each other ; 5 .",
    "their degree sequence follows a _ power - law _ distribution .",
    "see the book of chung and lu  @xcite for a more detailed exposition of these properties .    over the last decade",
    "a number of models have been developed whose aim was to capture these features . among the first such models",
    "is the _ preferential attachment model_. this is a class of models of randomly growing graphs whose aim is to capture a basic feature of real - world networks : nodes which are already popular tend to become more popular as the network grows .",
    "these models were first defined by albert and barabsi  @xcite and subsequently defined and studied rigorously by bollobs and riordan ( see for example  @xcite ,  @xcite ) .",
    "another extensively studied model was defined by chung and lu  @xcite , @xcite .",
    "here every vertex has a weight which effectively corresponds to its expected degree and every two vertices are joined independently of every other pair with probability that is proportional to the product of their weights .",
    "when the weights are set suitably , then the resulting random graph has power - law degree distribution .",
    "all these models are nonetheless insufficient in the sense that none of them succeeds in incorporating all the above features . for example the chung and lu model although it exhibits a power law degree distribution and average distance of order @xmath98 , when the exponent of the power law is between 2 and 3 ( see  @xcite ) ( with @xmath0 being the number of nodes of the random network ) it is locally tree - like around a typical vertex .",
    "thus , for the majority of the vertices their neighbourhoods form an independent set .",
    "this is also the situation regarding the barabsi - albert model .",
    "thus , it seems that there is a  missing link \" in the definitions of these models which is a key ingredient to the process of creating a social network .",
    "it seems plausible that the factor which is missing in these models is the _ hierarchical structure _ of a social network . to be more precise ,",
    "the hierarchies are not among nodes , but more importantly on the level of groups of nodes .",
    "real - world networks consist of heterogeneous nodes , which can be classified into groups . in turn",
    ", these groups can be classified into larger groups which consist of smaller subgroups and so on .",
    "for example , if we consider the network of citations , whose set of nodes is the set of research papers and there is a link from one paper to another if one cites the other , there is a natural classification of the nodes according to the scientific fields each paper belongs to ( see for example  @xcite ) . in the case of the network of web pages ,",
    "a similar classification can be considered in terms of the similarity between two web pages .",
    "that is , the more similar two web pages are , the more likely it is that there exists a hyperlink between them ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "this classification can be approximated by tree - like structures representing the hidden hierarchy of the network .",
    "the tree - likeness suggests that in fact the geometry of this hierarchy is _ hyperbolic_. as we have already seen in the above definitions , the volume growth in the hyperbolic space is exponential which is also the case , for example , when one considers a @xmath65-ary tree , that is , a rooted tree where every vertex has @xmath65 children .",
    "let us consider the poincar disc model .",
    "if we place the root of an infinite @xmath65-ary tree at the centre of the disc , then the hyperbolic metric provides the necessary room to embed the tree into the disc so that every edge has unit length in the embedding .",
    "see also  @xcite for a related discussion .    in this contribution ,",
    "however , we have only explored the degree sequence of random graphs on a hyperbolic space showing that in the sparse regime , they exhibit a power - law degree distribution with exponent that depends on the curvature of the underlying space .",
    "it remains to show that they also exhibit the small world phenomenon , proving that the typical distance between two randomly chosen vertices is small , for example @xmath98 .",
    "regarding the presence of clustering , krioukov et al .",
    "@xcite have shown with the use of non - rigorous arguments that these random graphs do exhibit clustering which can be adjusted through the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "this dependence also remains to be quantified rigorously .",
    "for the disc model , this existence of clustering has been verified by gugelmann et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we begin our analysis with some preliminary results which will be used throughout our proofs . in section  [ sec : distribution ] , we prove theorem  [ thm : degreedistribution ] and we continue in section  [ sec : corr ] with the analysis of the asymptotic correlation of the degrees of finite collections of vertices and the proof of theorem  [ thm : correlations ] .",
