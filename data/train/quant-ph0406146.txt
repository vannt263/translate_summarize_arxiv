    "with spin squeezed atomic ensembles , i.e. , samples where the variance of one of the angular momentum ( spin ) components is reduced compared with the coherent state value , one has the possibility to measure certain atomic and/or classical parameters beyond the precision set by the standard quantum noise .",
    "recent examples where this possibility was exploited include studies on magnetometry with collective atomic spins @xcite .",
    "the central feature in those works is the entanglement of collective continuous light - atom variables .",
    "this entanglement can be created by the free - space interaction between a trapped polarized atomic sample and an appropriately polarized propagating laser beam with photon energy adjusted to the energy spacing between the atomic energy levels @xcite .",
    "the probing of the atomic ensemble with the light field squeezes the atomic observable ( the atomic spin ) and enables an improved measurement , e.g. , of a magnetic field .",
    "the underlying squeezing of the collective atomic spin variable was dealt with in a series of papers ( see , e.g. , refs .",

    "@xcite , and investigate the spin - squeezing of continuous variable quantum systems in the approximation where the atomic and photonic degrees of freedom are described by a gaussian state . to this end we will use that the gaussian state is fully characterized by its expectation value vector and its covariance matrix and we will use that explicit formulae exist for the time evolution of the system _ and _ for the quantum state reduction under measurements , see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and references therein . in particular",
    ", the fact that the measurements are explicitly accounted for in the gaussian approximation is a strength of the present theory .    in the development of the theory",
    ", we shall consider a continuous wave ( cw ) beam of light passing through a cloud of trapped atoms .",
    "in the schrdinger picture we have an explicit update formula for the quantum state conditioned on the outcome of measurements carried out on a quantum system , but a light beam is a multi - mode field with an infinite dimensional hilbert space , in which a complete description of the quantum state is normally prohibitively complicated . the quantum mechanical description of cw optical fields is often formulated in terms of temporal correlation functions or the noise power spectrum of field operators in the heisenberg picture , which is , however , not a convenient formulation , when the field is being monitored continuously in time . when we restrict ourselves to gaussian states , however , it is possible to describe the field in the schrdinger picture and to dynamically evolve the combined quantum state of the interacting light field and atomic system .",

    "[ sec : thick ] , we investigate the case of an optically thick gas . in sec .",
    "[ sec : probing ] , we show that the maximally squeezed component of the gas will set the limit for the precision in a given measurement .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] briefly summarizes the results and concludes the paper .",
    "to describe the atom - light coupling , we imagine that the beam is split up into short segments of duration @xmath0 and corresponding length @xmath1 .",
    "these beam segments are chosen so short , that the field in a single segment can be treated as a single mode , and that the state of an atom interacting with the field does not change appreciably during time @xmath0 , so that the evolution of the atomic system is obtained by sequential interaction with light segments",
    ". since we are interested in modelling a cw coherent beam with constant intensity , we assume a mode function for each segment of the field which is constant on a length @xmath2 and within the transverse area @xmath3 , i.e. , the quantization of the field energy @xmath4 yields the relation between the electric field amplitude and the photon number in the segment of the field , @xmath5 . in the scheme for spin",
    "squeezing , we consider a light beam linearly polarized along the @xmath6 direction and propagating in the @xmath7 direction .",
    "the polarization can be decomposed in two polarization components with opposite circular polarization with respect to the quantization axis @xmath8 .",
    "these two components interact differently with the atoms because of the selection rules of the optical dipole transition .",
    "imagine atoms with a ground ( @xmath9 ) and an excited ( @xmath10 ) state with @xmath11 , interacting with the @xmath12 and @xmath13 components of the light field on the @xmath14 and @xmath15 transitions , respectively .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian between a collection of @xmath16 atoms , enumerated with the index @xmath17 and the two quantized fields thus writes @xmath18 with @xmath19 , @xmath20 the atomic dipole moment on the relevant transition , and @xmath21 the field per photon , identified above .",
    "we assume that the fields are frequency detuned by an amount @xmath22 with respect to the atomic resonance . in the limit where @xmath23",
    "the atoms are not excited by the fields , and the dynamics is entirely associated with the light - induced energy shifts of the ground states .",
    "adiabatic elimination of the upper states then leads to the effective hamiltonian @xmath24 which applies for the duration @xmath0 for which the field overlaps the atomic system .",
    "the photon field is suitably described by a stokes vector formalism , with a macroscopic value of the component @xmath25 , and where the @xmath26 operator yields the difference between the number of photons with the two circular polarizations , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 yields the difference between the number of photons polarized at @xmath29and @xmath30 , with respect to the @xmath8 axis , respectively .",
    "the stokes vector components obey the commutator relations of a fictitious spin , and the associated quantum mechanical uncertainty relation on @xmath28 and @xmath26 , @xmath31 , are in precise correspondence with the binomial distribution of the linearly polarized photons onto the other sets of orthogonal polarization directions .",
    "we introduce the effective cartesian coordinates @xmath32 with the standard commutator @xmath33=i$ ] and resulting uncertainty relation , which is minimized in the initial state , implying that this state is a gaussian state , i.e. , its wigner function is a gaussian function of the phase space coordinates .",
    "the atomic ensemble is initially prepared with all @xmath34 atoms in a superposition @xmath35 of the two ground states with respect to the quantization axis @xmath8 , i.e. , the total state of the atoms is initially given by @xmath36 .",
    "in this state , the system of two - level atoms is described by a collective spin vector , where the component along the @xmath6-direction attains the macroscopic value @xmath37 , and where the collective spin along the @xmath8-axis , @xmath38 , represents the population difference of the @xmath39 states . as for the photons ,",
    "the quantum mechanical uncertainty relation for the collective spin components of the atomic state corresponds exactly to the binomial distribution of the atoms on the two ground states , and also here it is convenient to introduce cartesian coordinates @xmath40 for which the initial state is a minimum uncertainty gaussian state .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hamil2 ] ) can be rewritten in terms of the effective atomic and field variables .",
    "first , we note that @xmath41 and that @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the photon flux .",
    "we then insert these expressions in eq .",
    "( [ hamil2 ] ) , leave out a constant energy shift and obtain the effective interaction hamiltonian @xmath44 we display the product of @xmath45 and @xmath0 , to expose the effect of the interaction with the whole segment , and we introduce the effective coupling constant @xmath46 the free - space coupling constant of light and atoms is small , and the coarse grained description will be perfectly valid even for the macroscopic values of @xmath47 required by our treatment .",
    "the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ hamil3 ] ) correlates the atoms and the light fields .",
    "it is bilinear in the canonical variables , and hence preserves the gaussian character of the joint state of the system @xcite .",
    "we have emphasized the convenience of using gaussian states , because their schrdinger picture representation is very efficient and compact .",
    "now , given that every segment of the optical beam becomes correlated with the atomic sample , as a function of time , the joint state of the atom and field has to be specified by a larger and larger number of mean values and second order moments .",
    "if no further interactions take place between quantum systems and the light after the interaction with the atoms , there is no need to keep track of the state of the total system . in practice , either the transmitted light may simply disappear or it may be registered in a detection process . in the former case ,",
    "the relevant description of the remaining system is obtained by a partial trace over the field state , which produces a new gaussian state of the atoms .",
    "we are interested in the case , where the polarization rotation of the field is registered , i.e. , the observable @xmath48 is measured .",
    "the effect of measuring one of the components in a multi - variable gaussian state is effectively to produce a new gaussian state of the remaining variables as discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : dyn ] .",
    "having established the fact that the quantum state of the atoms is at all times described as a gaussian state , we shall set up the precise formalism .",
    "for the column vector of the four variables @xmath49 describing the atoms and a single segment of the light beam , the heisenberg equations of motion yield @xmath50 with the transformation matrix @xmath51 from eq .",
    "( [ lintrans ] ) and the definition of the covariance matrix @xmath52 @xcite , we directly verify that @xmath53 transforms as @xmath54 due to the atom - light interaction .    in the probing process",
    "there is a small probability that the excited state levels which were adiabatically eliminated from the interaction hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ hamil3 ] ) will be populated .",
    "if this happens , the subsequent decay to one of the two @xmath55 ground states occurs with the rate @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the atomic decay width and @xmath58 is the resonant photon absorption cross - section .",
    "the consequence of the decay is a loss of spin polarization since a detection of the fluorescence photons in principle could tell to which ground state the atom decayed .",
    "if every atom has a probability @xmath59 to decay in time @xmath0 with equal probability into the two ground states , the collective mean spin vector is reduced by the corresponding factor @xmath60 .",
    "when the classical @xmath6-component is reduced this leads to a reduction with time of the coupling strength @xmath61 which was also discussed in refs .",
    "simultaneously , every photon on its way through the atomic gas has a probability for being absorbed @xcite @xmath62 this means that the vector of expectation values evolves as @xmath63 with @xmath64 .",
    "the fraction @xmath65 of atoms that have decayed represents a loss of collective squeezing because its correlation with the other atoms is lost , whereas it still provides a contribution @xmath66 per atom to the collective spin variance .",
    "we may use the symmetry of the collective spin operator under the exchange of particles to express the mean value of , e.g. , @xmath67 as @xmath68 where we have used that @xmath69 , and @xmath70 for all @xmath17 and @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) .",

    "the factor @xmath91 initially attains the value 2 , and increases by the factor @xmath92 in each time step @xmath0 .",
    "the factor @xmath93 is initially unity , and is approximately constant in time since the light field is continuously renewed by new segments of the light beam interacting with the atoms .",
    "an exception is the optically thick gas discussed below in sec .",
    "[ sec : thick ] .",
    "we note that the present accumulation of noise is based on the canonical @xmath6 and @xmath94 variables entering the covariance matrix , and not on the physical spin and stokes variables for the atoms and the photons , respectively . as discussed in more detail elsewhere",
    "@xcite , this introduces difficulties in the limit of large atomic decay probabilities . as long as",
    "the probability for atomic decay is small during the process under concern , however , the present approach is highly accurate .",
    "this is the regime considered in this work .    in the gaussian approximation ,",
