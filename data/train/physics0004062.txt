    "contemporary theories ( susy gut , superstring and others ) not only predict the dependence of fundamental physical constants on energy , but also have cosmological solutions in which low - energy values of these constants vary with the cosmological time . the predicted variation at the present epoch is small but non - zero , and it depends on theoretical model . in particular , damour and polyakov @xcite have developed a modern version of the string theory , whose parameters could be determined from cosmological variations of the coupling constants and hadron - to - electron mass ratios . clearly , a discovery of these variations would be a great step in our understanding of nature .",
    "even a reliable upper bound on a possible variation rate of a fundamental constant presents a valuable tool for selecting viable theoretical models .",
    "historically , a hypothesis that the fundamental constants may depend on the _ cosmological time _ @xmath4 ( that is the age of the universe ) was first discussed by milne @xcite and dirac @xcite .",
    "the latter author proposed his famous `` large - number hypothesis '' and suggested that the gravitational constant was directly proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "later the variability of fundamental constants was analyzed , using different arguments , by gamow @xcite , dyson @xcite , and others .",
    "the interest in the problem has been revived due to recent major achievements in gut and superstring models ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "presently , the fundamental constants are being measured with a relative error of @xmath5 .",
    "these measurements obviously rule out considerable variations of the constants on a short time scale , but do not exclude their changes over the lifetime of the universe , @xmath6 years .",
    "moreover , one can not rule out the possibility that the constants differ in widely separated regions of the universe ; this could be disproved only by astrophysical observations and different kinds of experiments .",
    "laboratory experiments can not trace possible variation of a fundamental constant during the entire history of the universe .",
    "fortunately , nature has provided us with a tool for direct measuring the physical constants in the early epochs .",
    "this tool is based on observations of quasars , the most powerful sources of radiation .",
    "many quasars belong to most distant objects we can observe .",
    "light from the distant quasars travels to us about @xmath3  years .",
    "this means that the quasar spectra registered now were formed @xmath7 years ago .",
    "the wavelengths of the lines observed in these spectra ( @xmath8 ) increase compared to their laboratory values ( @xmath9 ) in proportion @xmath8 = @xmath10 , where the _ cosmological redshift _",
    "@xmath11 can be used to determine the age of the universe at the line - formation epoch . in some cases ,",
    "the redshift is as high as @xmath12 , so that the intrinsically far - ultraviolet lines are registered in the visible range .",
    "the examples are demonstrated in fig .",
    "analysing these spectra we may study the epoch when the universe was several times younger than now .    here",
    "we review briefly the studies of the space - time variability of the fine - structure constant @xmath13 and the proton - to - electron mass ratio @xmath14 .",
    "various tests of the fundamental constant variability differ in space - time regions of the universe which they cover . _ local tests _ relate to the values of constants on the earth and in the solar system .",
    "in particular , _ laboratory tests _ infer the possible variation of certain combinations of constants `` here and now '' from comparison of different frequency standards .",
    "_ geophysical tests _",
    "impose constraints on combinations of fundamental constants over the past history of the solar system , although most of these constraints are very indirect .",
    "in contrast , _ astrophysical tests _ allows one to `` measure '' the values of fundamental constants in distant areas of the early universe .",
    "there were a number of laboratory experimets aimed at detection of trends of the fundamental constants with time by comparison of frequency standards which have different dependences on the constants .",
    "we mention only two of the published experiments .",
    "comparison of h - masers with cs - clocks during 427 days revealed a relative ( h  cs ) frequency drift with a rate @xmath15 per day , while the rates of ( h - h ) and ( cs  cs ) drifts ( i.e. , the drifts between identical standards , used to control their stability ) were less than @xmath16 per day @xcite .",
    "a similar result was found in comparison of a hg@xmath17-clock with a h - maser during 140 days @xcite : the rate of the relative frequency drift was less than @xmath18 per day .",
    "such a drift is treated as a consequence of a difference in the long - term stability of different atomic clocks . in principle , however , it may be caused by variation of @xmath13 .",
    "that is why it gives an upper limit to the @xmath13 variation @xcite : @xmath19 .",
    "the strongest bound on the possible time - variation rate of @xmath13 was derived in 1976 by shlyakhter @xcite , and recently , from a more detailed analysis , by damour and dyson @xcite , who obtained @xmath20 , the analysis was based on measurements of isotope ratios in the oklo site in gabon , where a unique natural uranium nuclear fission reactor had operated 1.8 billion years ago .",
    "the isotope ratios of samarium produced in this reactor by the neutron capture reaction @xmath21sm@xmath22sm@xmath23 would be completely different , if the energy of the nuclear resonance responsible for this capture were shifted at least by 0.1 ev .",
    "another strong bound , @xmath24 , was obtained by dyson @xcite from an isotopic analysis of natural radioactive decay products in meteorites .",
    "a weak point of these tests is their dependence on the model of the phenomenon , fairly complex , involving many physical effects .",
    "for instance , damour and dyson @xcite estimated possible shift of the above - mentioned resonance due to the @xmath13 variation , assuming that the coulomb energy of the excited state of @xmath25sm@xmath26 , responsible for the resonance , is not less than the coulomb energy of the _ ground _ state of @xmath25sm . in absence of experimental data on the nuclear state in question , this assumption is not justified , since heavy excited nuclei often have coulomb energies smaller than those for their ground states @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a correlation between the constants of strong and electroweak interactions ( which is likely in the frame of modern theory ) might lead to further softening of the mentioned bounds by 100-fold , to @xmath24 , as noted by sisterna and vucetich @xcite .",
    "in addition , the local tests can not be extended to distant space regions and to the early universe , since the law of possible space - time variation of @xmath13 is unknown _ a priory_. it is the extragalactic astronomy that allows us to study these remote regions of spacetime , in particular the regions which were causally disconnected at the epoch of formation of the observed absorption spectra .      to find out whether @xmath13 changed over the cosmological time ,",
    "we have studied the fine splitting of the doublet lines of siiv , civ , mgii and other ions , observed in the spectra of distant quasars .",
    "according to quantum electrodynamics , the relative splitting of these lines @xmath27 is proportional to @xmath28 ( neglecting very small corrections ) .",
    "consequently , if @xmath13 changed with time , then @xmath27 would depend on the cosmological redshift @xmath11 .",
    "this method of measuring @xmath13 in distant regions of the universe had been first suggested by savedoff @xcite and was used later by other authors .",
    "for instance , wolfe _",
    "@xcite derived an estimate @xmath29 from an observation of the mgii absorption doublet at @xmath30 .    an approximate formula which relates a deviation of @xmath13 at redshift @xmath11 from its current value , @xmath31 , with measured @xmath27 in the extragalactic spectra and in laboratory reads @xmath32 , \\label{dalpha}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 takes into account radiation corrections @xcite : for instance , for siiv @xmath34 .",
    "many high - quality quasar spectra measured in the last decade have enabled us to significantly increase the accuracy of determination of @xmath27 at large @xmath11 .",
    "an example of the spectra observed is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for the present report",
    ", we have selected the results of high - resolution observations @xcite , most suitable for an analysis of @xmath13 variation .",
    "the values of @xmath35 calculated from these data according to eq .",

    "this constraint is much more stringent than those obtained from all but one previous astronomical observations .",
    "the notable exception is presented by webb et al .",
    "@xcite , who have analysed spectroscopic data of similar quality , but estimated @xmath13 from comparison of feii and mgii fine - splitted walelengths in extragalactic spectra and in the laboratory .",
    "their result indicates a tentative time - variation of @xmath13 : @xmath44 at @xmath451.6 .",
    "note , however , two important sources of a possible systematic error which could mimic the effect : ( a ) fe , ii and mgii lines used are situated in different orders of the echelle - spectra , so relative shifts in calibration of the different orders can simulate the effect of @xmath13-variation , and ( b ) were the relative abundances of mg isotopes changing during the cosmological evolution , the mgii lines would be subjected to an additional @xmath11-dependent shift relative to the feii lines , quite sufficient to simulate the variation of @xmath13 ( this shift can be easily estimated from recent laboratory measurements @xcite ) . in contrast , the method based on the fine splitting of a line of the same ion species ( siiv in the above example ) is not affected by these two uncertainty sources .",
    "thus we believe that the restriction ( [ alpha - bound ] ) is the most reliable at present for the long - term history of the universe .    according to our analysis , some theoretical models are inconsistent with observations .",
    "for example , power laws @xmath46 with @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 , published by various authors in 1980s , are excluded . moreover ,",
    "the teller ",
    "dyson s hypothesis on the logarithmic dependence of @xmath13 on @xmath4 @xcite has also been shown to be inconsistent with observations .",
    "many regions of formation of the spectral lines , observed at large redshifts in different directions in the sky , had been causally disconnected at the epochs of line formation .",
    "thus , no information could have been exchanged between these regions of the universe and , in principle , the fundamental constants could be different there .",
    "however , a separate analysis @xcite has shown that @xmath13 value is the same in different directions in the sky within the @xmath50 relative error @xmath51 .",
    "the dimensionless constant @xmath52 approximately equals the ratio of the constants of strong interaction @xmath53 and electromagnetic interaction @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the effective coupling constant calculated from the amplitude of nucleon@xmath56-meson scattering at low energy .    in order to check the cosmological variability of @xmath14 we have used high - redshift absorption lines of molecular hydrogen h@xmath57 in the spectrum of the quasar pks 0528250",
    "this is the first ( and , in a sense , unique ) high - redshift system of h@xmath57 absorption lines discovered in 1985 @xcite .",
    "a study of these objects yields information of paramount importance on the physical conditions @xmath42 years ago .",
    "a possibility of distinguishing between the cosmological redshift of spectral wavelengths and shifts due to a variation of @xmath14 arises from the fact that the electronic , vibrational , and rotational energies of h@xmath57 each undergo a different dependence on the reduced mass of the molecule . hence comparing ratios of wavelengths @xmath58 of various h@xmath57 electron - vibration - rotational lines in a quasar spectrum at some redshift @xmath11 and in laboratory ( at @xmath40 )",
    ", we can trace variation of @xmath14 .",
    "the method had been used previously by foltz _",
    "@xcite , whose analysis was corrected later in our papers @xcite . in the latter papers , we calculated the sensitivity coefficients @xmath59 of the wavelengths @xmath58 with respect to possible variation of @xmath14 and applied a linear regression analysis to the measured redshifts of individual lines @xmath60 as function of @xmath59 .",
    "an illustration of the wavelength dependences on the mass of the nucleus is given in table [ tab2 ] , where a few resonance wavelengths of hydrogen , deuterium , and tritium molecules are listed .",
    "one can see that , as the nuclear mass increases , different wavelengths shift in different directions .",

    "several tens of the h@xmath57 lines have been identified ; a portion of the spectrum which reveales some of the lines is shown in fig .",
    "the redshift estimates for individual absorption lines with their individual errorbars are plotted in fig .",
