    "the bethe - heitler ( bh ) reaction  @xcite is a basic process for the production of real photons .",
    "when the real photons are produced from the interaction of an incoming electron with the coulomb field of an atom or a nucleus , it corresponds to the bremsstrahlung reaction which is commonly used to generate linearly and circularly polarized photon beams of various energies  @xcite . when the interaction occurs with the nuclear electromagnetic field , the bethe - heitler process carries information about the internal structure of the target nucleus represented by its electromagnetic form factors .",
    "while the inclusive process is a radiative correction to the lepton scattering cross section  @xcite , the exclusive process is an essential tool for the experimental determination of generalized nucleon polarizabilities  @xcite and generalized parton distributions ( gpd )  @xcite .    in the effort to improve our understanding of the nuclear structure  @xcite and to unravel the parton structure of nucleons and nuclei  @xcite via the ( deeply ) virtual compton scattering process ( ( d)vcs )  @xcite",
    ", the bh reaction appears as a powerful contamination of the global process of the lepto - production of real photons .",
    "( d)vcs corresponds to the absorption of a virtual photon by the nucleus ( parton ) followed by the emission of a real photon from the excited nucleus ( parton ) .",
    "involving the same initial and final states the bh and ( d)vcs processes interfere coherently . in the multi - gev energy range relevant for these studies ,",
    "the cross section for the lepto - production of real photons contains a strong , often dominant , contribution of the bh amplitude .",
    "the nuclear structure information of interest is extracted  @xcite from the unpolarized lepton cross section as a deviation from the bh contribution that should consequently be accurately subtracted . considering the cross section difference for incident polarized leptons of opposite helicities or opposite charges",
    ", the bh process serves as a magnifier of the ( d)vcs signal , the precise knowledge of its magnitude being still required to access the nuclear structure information .",
    "specifically , the bh process is the reference reaction of the lepto - production of real photons , and any attempt to access the nuclear structure via this reaction requires a very accurate knowledge of this reference process .    in most of the available calculations of this process ( see  @xcite for a review )",
    ", the mass of the incoming and scattered leptons is neglected , at variance with the crossed process ( lepton pair production ) where a few finite lepton mass calculations exist  .",
    "indeed , the ultra - relativistic approximation seems well - justified in the energy range spanned by electron scattering experiments at mami  @xcite , jlab   and desy  @xcite , and still justified for muon scattering experiments at cern  @xcite .",
    "however , a recent work on the bremsstrahlung and pair - creation processes may motivate a closer look at this approximation .",
    "revisiting cross sections and polarization observables for these processes , this work  @xcite showed that finite electron mass effects may result in strong differences as compared to previous massless calculations  @xcite . in the bremsstrahlung process",
    ", finite electron mass effects are shown to be significant in the end - point region of the cross section , and regularize polarization observables in that kinematical domain .",
    "the differences are even more striking for the pair - creation process , the reciprocal of bremsstrahlung , where the finite electron mass calculation allows for consistent polarization observables at energies as low as the reaction threshold . if it is intuitive that finite electron mass calculations should be more accurate at low incoming energy , it is less obvious to expect persistent strong differences as the energy increases .",
    "it is the merit of these calculations to show that additional terms involving the electron mass may significantly affect experimental observables even at relativistic energies .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to investigate the effects of finite lepton mass on the bh process in the perspective of the on - going and future vcs and dvcs experimental programs .",
