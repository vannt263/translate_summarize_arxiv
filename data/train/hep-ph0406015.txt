    "-0.2 cm recently a new narrow state of mass 2.317 gev that decays strongly into @xmath6 was announced @xcite .",
    "this result was confirmed @xcite and a second narrow state of mass 2.463 gev decaying into @xmath7 was observed .",
    "such states were first predicted in @xcite based on the chiral quark model @xcite .",
    "the latter implies the heavy - light @xmath8 resonance states to form an anti - triplet representation of the su(3 ) group . if one insists on a non - linear realization of the chiral su(3 ) group only , excluding any further model assumptions , an a priori statement can not be made for the existence of chiral partners of any given state .",
    "thus it is it is important to study the heavy - light meson and baryon resonances in great detail @xcite    + 0.04 cm in this talk we review a particularly important aspect of open - charm resonances : the role of coupled - channel effects .",
    "it is long known that light scalar mesons can be described quantitatively in terms of coupled - channel dynamics without assuming the existence of light quark - antiquark states with scalar quantum numbers @xcite .",
    "more recently it was pointed out by the authors @xcite that similarly the light axial - vector meson spectrum of qcd is naturally explained in terms of chiral coupled - channel dynamics .",
    "the leading term of the chiral lagrangian written down for the interaction of goldstone bosons with light vector mesons generates the axial - vector spectrum dynamically . moreover , chiral dynamics has the potential to predict the existence of exotic su(3 ) multiplets .",
    "for instance in @xcite weak attraction for s - wave scattering of goldstone bosons off the decuplet ground states was found in the 27-plet channels .",
    "this may lead to the existence of penta - quark type resonance states in the @xmath9-channel . since chiral coupled - channel dynamics is able to predict the s- and d - wave baryon resonance spectrum in terms of the leading order interaction term @xcite it is natural to expect coupled - channel dynamics to play also a crucial role in the physics of open - charm meson and baryon resonances .",
    "the possible importance of coupled - channel effects for the heavy - light meson resonances was anticipated by van beveren and rupp @xcite .",
    "systematic computations carried out by the authors @xcite based on the chiral lagrangian will be discussed here . for the possible role of diquark correlations in scalar open - charm meson resonances we refer to the talk of terasaki @xcite .",
    "-0.04 cm a coupled - channel effective field theory for the scattering of goldstone bosons off heavy - light meson and baryon fields is presented @xcite .",
    "it relies on the chiral su(3 ) lagrangian with heavy - light @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 fields , that transform non - linearly under the chiral su(3 ) group .",
    "the major result in the open - charm meson sector is the prediction that there exist chiral excitations in qcd with scalar and axial - vector quantum numbers forming anti - triplet and sextet representations of the su(3 ) group .",
    "this differs from the results of the chiral quark model leading to anti - triplet states only @xcite .",
    "it is pointed out that the heavy - quark symmetry , which suggests a degeneracy of scalar and axial - vector resonances at leading order , is naturally recovered in chiral coupled - channel theory .",
    "further results are derived for open - charm baryon states .",
    "the s - wave scattering of goldstone bosons off the anti - triplet and sextet ground states generates dynamically one anti - triplet , two sextet and one anti - quindecimet of states .",
    "this implies the existence of exotic penta - quark - like states with open - charm quantum numbers .",
    "-0.04 cm particular results concern the heavy su(3 ) limit with @xmath13 mev in which we predict bound states rather than resonance states typically .",
    "this observation should facilitate the verification of chiral coupled - channel dynamics via un - quenched qcd lattice simulations . in the light su(3 ) limit with @xmath14 mev no clear resonance nor bound - state signals persist .",
    "the latter prediction poses a true challenge for un - quenched qcd lattice simulation , requiring small current quark masses as well as the analysis of extremely broad spectral distributions from euclidian - space resonance propagators .",

    "<S> we review the open - charm spectrum of chiral excitations in qcd . at leading order in a chiral expansion </S>",
    "<S> a parameter - free prediction is obtained for the coupled - channel scattering of goldstone bosons off open - charm mesons and baryons with @xmath0 and @xmath1 quantum numbers . </S>",
    "<S> the recently announced narrow @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons observed by the babar and cleo collaborations are reproduced . </S>",
    "<S> also the baryon states @xmath4 and @xmath5 discovered earlier by the cleo collaboration are recovered naturally . besides describing resonances with conventional quantum numbers additional multiplets with members that carry exotic quantum numbers are predicted . in particular , so far unobserved narrow isospin - singlet open - charm mesons with negative strangeness are generated dynamically . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , narrow isospin - doublet open - charm baryons with positive strangeness are suggested . </S>"
