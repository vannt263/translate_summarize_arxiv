    "( moreover , it is not clear what is meant by `` triangulation '' : do the tetrahedra need to be embedded ? are ideal vertices admitted when @xmath2 has boundary ? )    in 1988 , matveev introduced  @xcite for any compact @xmath0-manifold @xmath2 a non - negative integer @xmath4 , which he called the _ complexity _ of @xmath2 , defined as the minimum number of vertices of a _ simple spine _ of @xmath2 .",
    "the function @xmath5 is finite - to - one on the most interesting sets of compact 3-manifolds , and it behaves well with respect to the most important cut - and - paste operations .",

    "we recall some definitions used throughout the paper .",
    "let @xmath2 be a compact @xmath0-manifold , possibly with boundary .",
    "we say that @xmath2 is _ hyperbolic _ if it admits ( after removing all tori and klein bottles from the boundary ) a complete hyperbolic metric of finite volume ( possibly with cusps and geodesic boundary ) .",
    "such a metric is unique by mostow s theorem ( see  @xcite for a proof ) .",
    "a surface in @xmath2 is _ essential _ if it is incompressible , @xmath14-incompressible , and not @xmath14-parallel .",
    "hyperbolicity theorem for haken manifolds ensures that a compact @xmath2 with boundary is hyperbolic if and only if every component of @xmath15 has @xmath16 , and @xmath2 does not contain essential surfaces with @xmath17 .",
    "the complexity satisfies also the following strict inequalities .    filling : :",
    "every closed hyperbolic @xmath2 is a dehn filling of some    hyperbolic @xmath9 with @xmath18 ;    strict monotonicity : :    @xmath19 if @xmath20 is essential and    @xmath2 is closed    @xmath7-irreducible  or hyperbolic ;    some results in complexity zero already show that the finiteness property does not hold for all compact @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "complexity zero : :    the closed    @xmath7-irreducible  manifolds with    @xmath21 are @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we also    have @xmath24 .",
    "interval bundles over surfaces and handlebodies also have    @xmath21 .    the ball and the solid torus have therefore complexity zero .",
    "moreover , the additivity property actually also holds for @xmath14-connected sums .",
    "these two facts together imply the following .",
    "stability : :    the complexity of @xmath2 does not change when adding    1-handles to @xmath2 or removing interior balls from it .    note that both such operations that not affect @xmath5 are `` invertible '' and hence topologically inessential . in what follows ,",
    "a simplicial face - pairing @xmath25 of some tetrahedra is a _ triangulation _ of a closed 3-manifold @xmath2 when @xmath26 .",

    "a simplicial pairing @xmath25 is an _ ideal triangulation _ of a compact @xmath2 with boundary if @xmath2 is @xmath27 minus open stars of all the vertices .",
    "the finiteness property above follows easily from the following .",
    "naturality : :    if @xmath2 is closed    @xmath7-irreducible  and not    @xmath28 or    @xmath23 , then @xmath4 is the minimum number of    tetrahedra in a triangulation of @xmath2 . if @xmath9    is hyperbolic with boundary , then @xmath29 is the minimum    number of tetrahedra in an ideal triangulation of @xmath9 .",
    "the beauty of matveev s complexity theory relies on the fact that simple spines are more flexible than triangulations : for instance spines can often be simplified by puncturing faces , and can always be cut along normal surfaces . in particular , we have the following result .",
    "an ( ideal ) triangulation @xmath25 of @xmath2 is _ minimal _ when @xmath2 can not be ( ideally ) triangulated with fewer tetrahedra .",

    "we then show a nice relation between spines without vertices and riemannian geometry , found by alexander and bishop  @xcite . finally , we prove the filling property stated in the introduction .",
    "we start with the following definition .",
    "a compact 2-dimensional polyhedron @xmath49 is _ simple _ if the link of every point in @xmath49 is contained in the graph .",
    "alternatively , @xmath49 is simple if it is locally contained in the polyhedron shown in fig .",
    "[ special : fig]-(3 ) . a point , a compact graph , a compact surface are therefore simple .",
    "the polyhedron given by two orthogonal discs intersecting in their diameter is not simple .",
    "three important possible kinds of neighborhoods of points are shown in fig .",
    "[ special : fig ] . a point having the whole of as a link",
    "is called a _ vertex _ , and its regular neighborhood is shown in fig .",
    "[ special : fig]-(3 ) .",
    "the set @xmath50 of the vertices of @xmath49 consists of isolated points , so it is finite .",
    "note that points , graphs , and surfaces do not contain vertices .",
    "a compact polyhedron @xmath51 is a _ spine _ of a compact manifold @xmath2 with boundary if @xmath2 collapses onto @xmath49 .",
    "when @xmath2 is closed , we say that @xmath51 is a _ spine _ if @xmath52 is an open ball .",
    "the _ complexity _ @xmath4 of a compact 3-manifold @xmath2 is the minimal number of vertices of a simple spine of @xmath2 .",
    "as an example , a point is a spine of @xmath30 , and therefore @xmath53 .",
    "a simple polyhedron is _ special _ when every point has a neighborhood of one of the types ( 1)-(3 ) shown in fig .",
    "[ special : fig ] , and the sets of such points induce a cellularization of @xmath49 . that is , defining @xmath54 as the set of points of type ( 2 ) or ( 3 ) , the components of @xmath55 should be open discs  the _ faces _  and the components of @xmath56 should be open segments  the _",
    "edges_.    [ spine : triangulation : rem ] a special spine of a compact @xmath2 with boundary is dual to an ideal triangulation of @xmath2 , and a special spine of a closed @xmath2 is dual to a 1-vertex triangulation of @xmath2 , as suggested by fig .",
    "[ dualspine : fig ] .",
    "in particular , a special spine is a spine of a unique manifold .",
    "therefore the naturality property of @xmath5 may be read as follows : every closed irreducible or hyperbolic manifold distinct from @xmath57 , and @xmath23 has a special spine with @xmath4 vertices . such a special spine is then called _ minimal_.      a handlebody @xmath2 collapses onto a graph , which has no vertices , hence @xmath58 . an interval bundle",
    "@xmath2 over a surface has that surface as a spine , and hence @xmath58 again .",
    "note that , by shrinking the fibers of the bundle , the manifold @xmath2 admits product metrics with arbitrarily small injectivity radius and uniformly bounded curvature .",
    "this is a particular case of a relation between spines and riemannian geometry found by alexander and bishop  @xcite .",
    "a riemannian 3-manifold @xmath2 is _ thin _ when its curvature - normalized injectivity radius is less than some constant @xmath59 , see  @xcite for details",
    ". we have the following .",
    "a thin riemannian 3-manifold has complexity zero .",
    "we prove here the filling property , stated in the introduction .",
    "recall from  @xcite that by thickening a special spine @xmath49 of @xmath2 we get a handle decomposition @xmath60 of the same @xmath2 .",
    "normal surfaces in @xmath60 correspond to normal surfaces in the ( possibly ideal ) triangulation dual to @xmath49 .",
    "[ filling : teo ] every closed hyperbolic manifold @xmath2 is a dehn filling of some hyperbolic @xmath9 with @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath49 be a minimal special spine of @xmath2 , which exists by remark  [ spine : triangulation : rem ] .",
    "take a face @xmath61 of @xmath49 . by puncturing @xmath61 and collapsing the resulting polyhedron as much as possible ,",
    "we get a simple spine @xmath62 of some @xmath9 obtained by drilling @xmath2 along a curve . since @xmath49 is special , @xmath61 is incident to at least one vertex . during the collapse ,",
    "all vertices adjacent to @xmath61 have disappeared , hence @xmath62 has less vertices than @xmath49 .",
    "this gives @xmath18 .",
    "if @xmath9 is hyperbolic we are done .",
    "suppose it is not .",
    "then it is reducible , seifert , or toroidal .",
    "if @xmath9 is reducible , the drilled solid torus is contained in a ball of @xmath2 and we get @xmath63 for some @xmath43 , hence @xmath64 by the additivity property",
    ". then @xmath9 is irreducible .",
    "moreover @xmath65 is incompressible in @xmath9 ( because @xmath2 is not a lens space ) .",
    "then the 1-dimensional portion of @xmath62 can be removed , and we can suppose @xmath66 is a spine of @xmath9 having only points of the type of fig .",
    "[ special : fig ] .",
    "our @xmath9 can not be seifert ( because @xmath2 is hyperbolic ) , hence its jsj  decompostion consists of some tori @xmath67 .",
    "each @xmath68 is essential in @xmath9 and compressible in @xmath2 .",
    "each @xmath68 can be isotoped in normal position with respect to @xmath69 . since @xmath66 , every normal surface in @xmath69 is normal also in @xmath60 .",
    "the only normal surface in @xmath60 not containing squares is the vertex - linking sphere , therefore we have @xmath70 for all @xmath71 by the normal surfaces property .",
    "each @xmath68 is compressible in @xmath2 , hence either it bounds a solid torus or is contained in a ball .",
    "the latter case is excluded , otherwise @xmath72 is the union of @xmath73 and a solid torus , and @xmath74",
    ".    therefore each @xmath68 bounds a solid torus in @xmath2 .",
    "each solid torus contains the drilled curve , hence they all intersect , and there is a solid torus @xmath75 bounded by a @xmath68 containing all the others .",
    "therefore @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a block of the jsj  decomposition , which can not be seifert , hence it is hyperbolic .",
    "we have @xmath78 , and @xmath2 is obtained by filling @xmath77 , as required .",
