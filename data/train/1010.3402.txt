    "quantum information , including quantum entanglement and quantum dissonance @xcite , has been a popular area of research in recent years . in this field , entanglement undoubtedly plays a central role as an important resource in quantum computation @xcite , teleportation @xcite , dense coding @xcite and cryptography @xcite .",
    "there have been many meaningful works on the dynamics of entanglement in multiple qubits , especially two qubits , interacting with different kinds of environments and we now know some important features of the entanglement such as the entanglement sudden death @xcite and birth @xcite .",
    "however , environments with different properties will have different effects on the entanglement dynamics .",
    "recently quantum systems in a non - markovian environment have been a subject of great interest @xcite .",
    "theoretical treatments have been developed to deal with this situation , such as ref.@xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "of particular interest to us is the hierarchy equations approach employed by dijkstra and tanimura @xcite .",
    "this treatment is deduced using the influence functional method of feynman and vernon without the limitation of perturbative , markovian or rotating wave approximations .",
    "it can easily take into account the effect of the system - bath coupling on the dynamics of the entanglement for any initial conditions . in their work",
    ", they discussed the entanglement evolution of two qubits interacting with a quantum - mechanical bath and then compared this hierarchy method with the redfield equation .",
    "it is found that the result of the full calculation markedly differs from the redfield predictions . in the present work",
    "we continue this meaningful work .",
    "we first introduce the method of hierarchy equations of motion developed by y. tanimura and coworkers in ref.@xcite .",
    "then we employ this method to carefully calculate the entanglement dynamics of a two - qubit system interacting with a non - markovian environment , determining the influence of the strength of the system - bath interaction , the characteristic frequency of the bath and the environment temperature on the time evolution of the entanglement , especially on the sudden death and sudden birth time points .",
    "the entanglement of the two qubits should be measured using wootters concurrence @xcite : @xmath0 and @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the density matrix of system ab , @xmath3 denotes the complex conjugation of @xmath2 and @xmath4 is the pauli matrix .",
    "@xmath5 are the eigenvalues of @xmath6 ( @xmath7 should be the largest eigenvalue ) .",
    "for simplicity , we set @xmath8 throughout this report .",
    "we assume that the two qubits are coupled independently to two identical baths with the same strength .",
    "the baths have a characteristic frequency @xmath9 , and large and small @xmath9 indicate fast and slow baths respectively . the energy gap of the qubits is @xmath10 and the qubits",
    "are coupled by an interaction @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , we can write the standard system hamilton as @xcite @xmath12 the subscripts 1 and 2 represent the two qubits and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the creation and annihilation operators .",
    "we choose a model that adequately represents the environment as a set of oscillators with a coupling linear in the oscillator coordinates , having the form @xcite @xmath15 and @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the hamilton for the bath and @xmath18 is the interaction item of the system and bath . @xmath19 ,",
    "@xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are the coordinate , momentum , mass , and frequency of the @xmath23th harmonic oscillator , respectively .",
    "@xmath24 is the strength of coupling of the @xmath25th qubit to the @xmath23th oscillator . to obtain complete information about the effect of the environment",
    ", we introduce the spectral density @xmath26 , which is defined as @xmath27 and in this report we assume that @xmath28 which comes from the lorentzian cutoff @xcite , and is the same for both qubits .",
    "the the hierarchy equations approach then gives the equation of motion for the system density matrix , which has the form @xcite : @xmath29\\nonumber\\\\ & & -i\\sum_{m=1}^2\\sum_{k=0}^k[v_m,\\rho_{n_{mk}+1}(t)]-i\\sum_{m=1}^2\\sum_{k=0}^kn_{mk}(c_kv_m\\rho_{n_{mk}-1}(t)-c_k^\\ast\\rho_{n_{mk}-1}(t)v_m),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 $ ] , @xmath31 ( the bath frequency ) , @xmath32 ( for @xmath33 ) are matsubara frequencies , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath33 , and @xmath36 .    in this equation",
    ", only @xmath37 represents the physical system density operator , and other @xmath38 are called auxiliary density operators ( ados ) .",
    "the subscript @xmath39 is a multi - index , which has @xmath40 dimensions and can be extended as @xmath41 , i.e. @xmath42 , @xmath43, ... ,@xmath44 ; @xmath45 , @xmath46, ... ,@xmath47 .",
    "the notation @xmath48 refers to an increase and decrease of this index .",
    "when the auxiliary density operators are all zero , the system and bath are not coupled ; when the density operators are nonzero , we should properly take the coupling into consideration , which will influence the entanglement evolution dramatically .",
    "all of these values contain important information about the coupling .",
    "the method can be employed to calculate the dynamics of a system in a bath from any initial state ( correlated or not ) in a computer program with the truncating method developed by a. ishizaki and y. tanimura @xcite . in the present work",
    ", we investigate the behavior of the entanglement death and rebirth time points with respect to several influential factors mentioned above .",
    "however , the range of all parameters should be carefully determined so as to obey the termination approximation and ensure that the results are sufficiently precise .",
    "we choose @xmath49 , @xmath50 from @xmath51 to @xmath52 , @xmath9 from @xmath51 to @xmath53 , and @xmath54 from @xmath55 to @xmath56 .",
    "our initial state is chosen as @xmath57 in the standard product @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the excited state and ground state of the @xmath25th qubit .",
    "we know that @xmath50 is related to the system - bath coupling strength . though the function of @xmath50 in the entanglement dynamics we can infer that when the coupling is weak , a slow decay of the concurrence is expected because the flow of information from the system into the bath will be slow , whereas the decay will definitely be rapid when the system and bath are tightly correlated .",
    "figure[interaction1 ] proves our inference ; we see that the decay of occurrence is slower when @xmath50 is small than when @xmath50 is large .",
    "the figure also indicates that small @xmath50 may result in strong vibration of the concurrence .",
    "the environment can return a small amount of information to the system during the evolution . with weak coupling ( small @xmath50 )",
    ", this little returned information will have a strong effect on the curve of the entanglement when the concurrence is small , and thus , there is oscillation . as @xmath50 increases , the curve becomes smoother , and there is only one pair of death and birth time points . from fig.[interaction2 ] , we see clearly the change in death and birth time points with the increase in @xmath50 .",
    "the negative slopes of these curves are consistent with the effect of @xmath50 discussed above .",
    "it is interesting to find that at some intervals the slopes of these curves suddenly change in fig.[interaction2 ] .",
    "this phenomenon is due to a change in the slope near the death and birth points on the concurrence curve .",
    "figures[bathspeed1 ] and [ bathspeed2 ] show the influence of the characteristic frequency of the bath on the dynamics of the entanglement .",
    "large @xmath9 means a fast bath . because the frequency of the two level system in this report is @xmath64 , and",
    "if we take into account the range of @xmath9 discussed here we know that the bath is slow .",
    "most theoretical treatments with which we describe this entanglement dynamics are valid only if there is a fast bath , which has a much larger characteristic frequency than the system . only in the fast bath scenario",
    "can we choose the initial state in which the system and bath are not correlated @xcite .",
    "however , as mentioned before , the hierarchy method can easily solve a slow bath situation , taking into consideration the bath effect on the entanglement in the initial state .",
    "a slow bath can receive and return the information from the system slowly and a fast bath may absorb all the information in a very short time and there may not even be revival , as we show in fig.[bathspeed1 ] .",
    "this can explain the delay in the death and birth when @xmath9 is small .",
    "more details are shown in fig.[bathspeed2 ] .",
    "the death and birth time points approach zero with an increase in @xmath9 . with smaller @xmath50",
    ", we see that all time points increase , for the reason discussed above .",
    "temperature influences the system dramatically . in ref.@xcite",
    "it is seen that the low - temperature scenario is unsuitable for born and ultrafast bath approximations , which are used in many theoretical treatments ; however , this scenario is in the solvable range of the hierarchy equations approach . in fig.[temperature ] , the death time point increases and birth time point decreases with a decrease in temperature . that is to say , the entanglement revives more quickly at lower temperature .",
    "the figure infers that the concurrence curve should be sufficiently smooth , and with the increase in @xmath54 , the whole curve is raised up to obtain a smaller death time interval .",
    "if we simulate the two curves in the figure and calculate the relationship between @xmath54 and the time point , then we may simply change the environment temperature to prepare our desired states and dynamics of the entanglement in experiments .",
    "in fact , with higher hierarchy of the ados , we can investigate a larger @xmath54 scenario .",
    "however , the computation time is too great as it increases exponentially with higher orders .",
    "in this report we studied the entanglement dynamics of two - qubit in a non - markovian environment using the recently developed hierarchy equations approach .",
    "we explored in detail the role of parameters in the entanglement evolution , including the system - bath interaction @xmath50 , the temperature @xmath65 and the bath frequency @xmath9 .",
    "all these important features are useful when preparing a desired system state in an experiment .",
    "we also showed this hierarchy equations approach to be effective in calculating the dynamics of a system in many possible scenarios . applying a higher order of the equation for a broader range of parameters and the physical meaning of non - zero ados will be future work .",
    "we appreciate helpful comments on the manuscript made by hong - yuan yuan and thank min - jie zhu and feng - cheng wu for modification of the calculation program .",
