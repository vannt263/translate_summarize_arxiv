    "one of the important tasks of nuclear physics has been and still is to understand the internal structure of nucleons in terms of quarks and gluons , which are the fundamental degrees of freedom of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "qcd , the widely accepted theory of the strong interaction , has been well - tested through perturbative calculations at high energies where quarks and gluons behave like free particles@xcite . however , perturbative calculations break down at low energies , where colored quarks and gluons are bounded inside colorless hadron , since the strong interaction coupling constant increases with the decrement of the energy scale . therefore",
    ", the internal structure of nucleons still remains illusive .",
    "although a full description of nucleon structure is not calculable yet , experimental measurements of the universal parton distribution functions ( pdfs)@xcite have provided unique and quantitative information about the partonic dynamics .",
    "pdfs , which are probability densities of finding a parton inside a hadron , bridge nucleons and their partonic structure together with the fragmentation functions ( ffs ) , which are probability densities that a parton hadronize into a hadron . in particular ,",
    "the energy evolution of pdfs has been one of the best tests of qcd .    in the leading twist",
    ", there are three quark distribution functions after integrating over the quark transverse momentum : the unpolarized pdf @xmath7 , the longitudinal polarized pdf @xmath8 , and the quark transversity pdf @xmath9 . through several decades of experimental and theoretical efforts@xcite ,",
    "the unpolarized pdf @xmath7 has been extracted with an excellent precision over a large range of @xmath10 and @xmath5 from dis , drell - yan , and other processes . with advances in experimental techniques of polarizing leptons and nucleons@xcite",
    ", the longitudinal polarized pdf @xmath8 has also been extracted with a reasonable precision over a range of @xmath10 and @xmath5 .",
    "the least known among these three pdfs is the chirally odd transversity pdf @xmath9 , which was initially discussed by hidaka , monsay , and sivers@xcite in 1978 , by ralston and soper@xcite in 1979 , and later by jaffe and ji@xcite in early 1990s .",
    "the lowest moment of @xmath9 is called the `` tensor charge '' , which is a fundamental property of the nucleon , and has been calculated from lattice qcd@xcite and various models@xcite .",
    "transversity is further constrained by soffer s inequality@xcite , @xmath11 , which holds under the next - to - leading - order qcd evolution@xcite . however , a possible violation of soffer s bound has been suggested@xcite .    compared to the collinear pdf @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , their corresponding tmds depend not only on the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath10 , but also on the parton transverse momentum @xmath12 .",
    "tmds provide a full 3-d view of the nucleon structure in momentum space .",
    "for example , an intuitive interpretation of the unpolarized tmd @xmath7 is that it represents the probability of finding a parton inside a nucleon with a longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath10 and a transverse momentum @xmath12 . beside tmds @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 ,",
    "there are five more transverse momentum dependent distribution functions ( tmds ) in the leading twist@xcite .",
    "they are the sivers function @xmath13 , the boer mulders function @xmath14 , the transversal helicity function @xmath15 , the longitudinal transversity function @xmath16 , and the pretzelosity functions @xmath17 .",
    "all eight tmds and their isospin structure have been studied in the large-@xmath18 qcd  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these additional five tmds require interferences between wave function components with different amounts of orbital angular momentum ( oam)@xcite , and thus require non - zero oam .",
    "the sivers function @xmath19 ( the boer mulders function @xmath20 ) provides information about the correlation between the quark oam and the nucleon ( the quark ) spin . in comparison , the longitudinal function @xmath21 and the transversity function @xmath22 describe correlations between the quark spin and the nucleon spin .",
    "furthermore , the sivers function @xmath19 and the boer mulders function @xmath20 are t - odd functions , which rely on the final state interactions ( fsi ) experienced by the active quark in semi - inclusive dis ( sidis ) process as both functions vanish without fsi . on the other hand , the transversal helicity function @xmath15 , the longitudinal transversity function @xmath23 and the pretzelosity functions @xmath17 are t - even and as a result do not require fsi to be nonzero",
    ". the wealth of information from all these functions could thus provide invaluable information about the quark orbital angular momentum .",
    "definitions of the azimuthal angle @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and the hadron transverse momentum for sidis process in the nucleon - at - rest frame following the trento convention@xcite . here ,",
    "@xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 represent the momenta of the initial lepton , the scattered lepton , the leading hadron , and the spin vector of the initial nucleon , respectively.,width=340 ]    compared to inclusive dis process , in which only the scattered lepton is detected , sidis process @xmath30 also requires detection of one of the leading hadrons fragmented from the struck quark . by using the leading hadron to tag the flavor , the spin , and the transverse momentum information of the struck quark , sidis process provides unique sensitivities to tmds .",
    "[ fig : angle ] shows the kinematics of sidis process following the trento convention@xcite .",
    "the sidis reaction is regarded as one of the golden channels to access tmds , since it can access all eight leading twist tmds with different combinations of beam and target polarizations@xcite .",
    "for example , the angular dependence of the single spin asymmetry ( ssa ) @xmath31 in the scattering of an unpolarized lepton beam off a transversely polarized target is : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the target polarization , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the azimuthal angles of the hadron momentum and the target spin relative to the lepton scattering plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig : angle ] ) , @xmath34 is the normalized yield .",
    "@xmath35 is the collins moment , which probes the convolution of the chiral - odd transversity distribution @xmath9 and the chiral - odd collins fragmentation function ( ff)@xcite .",
    "@xmath36 is the sivers moment , which probes the convolution of the naive t - odd quark sivers function @xmath13@xcite and the unpolarized ff @xmath37@xcite .",
    "while the transversity function describes the correlation of the quark spin with the nucleon spin ( the probability of finding a transversely polarized parton inside a transversely polarized nucleon ) , the sivers function reveals the correlation of the quark oam with the nucleon spin . in particular , authors of ref .",
    "provided constrains of quark angular momentum with world data of sivers asymmetries and nucleon magnetic moments by assuming a connection between the generalized parton distribution e  @xcite and the sivers distribution .",
    "since the sivers function is odd under the naive time - reversal transformation , it was originally believed to vanish@xcite .",
    "recently , authors of ref .   showed that a nonzero @xmath38 was possible due to qcd fsi between the struck quark and the residual nucleon system .",
    "it was further demonstrated that the sivers function that appears in the drell - yan process is the same as the one in sidis , but with an opposite sign due to changes in the gauge link@xcite .",
    "the experimental tests of above relation are crucial in order to demonstrate the validity of the qcd factorization theorem .",
    "another example is the angular dependence of the beam - helicity double - spin asymmetry ( dsa ) @xmath39 with a transversely polarized nucleon target and a longitudinal polarized lepton beam : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the polarization of the lepton beam , and @xmath42 are the normalized yields for beam helicity states of @xmath43 .",
    "the first and second subscripts to @xmath44 denote the respective polarization of beam and target ( l , t , and u represent longitudinal , transverse , and unpolarized , respectively ) .",
    "similar to the collins and sivers moments , the @xmath45 moment measures the convolution of @xmath15 and the unpolarized ff @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath15 has been calculated by lattice qcd@xcite and in various quark models@xcite . in general , @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) is suggested to be positive ( negative ) .",
    "in addition , @xmath15 is shown to be closely connected with other tmds through models .",
    "first , the @xmath48-moment of @xmath15 is linked to the collinear @xmath8 pdf through a wandzura - wilczek - type approximation@xcite in the leading twist .",
    "second , @xmath49 can be expressed as the combination of the quark transversity distribution @xmath50 and the pretzelosity distribution @xmath51 within the qcd parton model@xcite .",
    "last , @xmath52 is shown to be the same as @xmath53 , but with an opposite sign in many models@xcite as a consequence of a geometric relation and some initial lattice calculations@xcite .    on the experimental side ,",
    "the hermes and the compass collaborations have performed pioneer work in measuring the ssa and the dsa . in particular , the hermes collaboration carried out the first ssa measurement in sidis on a transversely polarized proton target using @xmath54 beams@xcite at @xmath55 gev@xmath6 .",
    "the compass collaboration performed the sidis measurements with a muon beam on transversely polarized deuteron@xcite and proton@xcite targets at @xmath56 gev@xmath6 .",
    "both the hermes@xcite and the compass@xcite proton data show significantly positive @xmath57 sivers moments and close to zero @xmath58 sivers moments , while results from the compass deuteron data are consistent with zero .",
    "these measurements indicate a strong flavor dependence of the sivers function@xcite .",
    "in addition , though the hermes and the compass @xmath57 sivers moments from their proton data are consistent in sign , potential discrepancies exist in magnitudes .",
    "these discrepancies might be attributed to the energy evolution of the sivers function@xcite . for the collins moment , large asymmetries were observed for both @xmath57 and @xmath58 from the proton data , but with opposite sign .",
    "these results show that the `` unfavored '' collins ff could be as large as the `` favored '' one@xcite , which is also consistent with the measured asymmetries of the inclusive hadron pair production in the @xmath59 annihilation from the belle collaboration@xcite ( a direct measurement of product of collins ffs ) . furthermore , deuteron collins asymmetries for @xmath57 and @xmath58 are consistent with zero , which suggests a cancellation between proton and neutron . for the @xmath60 dsa ,",
    "the preliminary results of the compass collaboration from deuteron@xcite and proton@xcite are consistent with zero within uncertainties .",
    "the preliminary results of proton from the hermes collaboration@xcite are also mostly consistent with zero within uncertainties , except that a hint of positive @xmath57 moment is observed in the valence region .    due to the nature of the electromagnetic interaction and charges of the @xmath61 ( 2/3 ) and the @xmath62 ( -1/3 ) quarks , the sidis measurement of a proton target would be dominated by the contribution from @xmath61 quarks . to shed light on the flavor structure of tmds ,",
    "it is important to perform the ssa and the dsa sidis measurements on a neutron target , which is more sensitive to the @xmath62-quark contribution .",
    "since there is no stable free neutron target , polarized @xmath63he is commonly used as an effective polarized neutron target@xcite .",
    "the @xmath63he nucleus is uniquely advantageous in extraction of information on the neutron spin compared to the deuteron ( p+n ) , since the ground state of @xmath63he is dominated by the s state , where the two protons spins cancel each other .",

    "<S> parton distribution functions , which represent the flavor and spin structure of the nucleon , provide invaluable information in illuminating quantum chromodynamics in the confinement region . among various processes that measure such parton distribution functions , semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering is regarded as one of the golden channels to access transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions , which provide a 3-d view of the nucleon structure in momentum space . the jefferson lab experiment e06 - 010 focuses on measuring the target single and double spin asymmetries in the @xmath0 reaction with a transversely polarized @xmath1 target in hall a with a 5.89 gev electron beam . </S>",
    "<S> a leading pion and the scattered electron are detected in coincidence by the left high - resolution spectrometer at @xmath2 and the bigbite spectrometer at @xmath3 beam right , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the kinematic coverage concentrates in the valence quark region , x @xmath40.1 - 0.4 , at @xmath5 @xmath4 1 - 3 gev@xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the collins and sivers asymmetries of @xmath1 and neutron are extracted . in this review , </S>",
    "<S> an overview of the experiment and the final results are presented . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , an upcoming 12-gev program with a large acceptance solenoidal device and the future possibilities at an electron - ion collider are discussed . </S>"
