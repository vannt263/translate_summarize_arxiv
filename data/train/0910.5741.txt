    "more impressively , one year after launch , the large area telescope ( _ lat _ ) onboard fermi gamma - ray space telescope ( _ fermi _ ) has discovered more than 40 new gamma - ray pulsars @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity and timing capability of _ fermi - lat _ have also provided the most precise light curves and phase resolved pulsar spectra @xcite .",
    "these new discoveries have greatly expanded the sample of gamma - ray pulsars and underscored the importance of understanding the origin of double - peak profiles . at the same time , the diversity of light curves from latest gamma - ray pulsar sample calls for improvements in theoretical modeling .",
    "the widely separated double peak feature in the gamma - ray light curves suggests emission coming from the outer magnetosphere .",
    "gamma rays are believed to be produced by energetic particles accelerated in the ",
    "gap \" regions in the magnetosphere .",
    "the particles emit via curvature , synchrotron and inverse compton ( ic ) radiation .",
    "various theoretical models differ in the assumed location of the emission zones ( i.e. , the gaps ) .",
    "conventional models for pulsar gamma - ray emission include the polar cap model @xcite , the slot gap model ( sg , or two - pole caustic model , tpc for short ; @xcite ) , the outer gap model(og , @xcite ) , as well as the inner annular gap model ( iag , @xcite ) .",
    "most calculations from these models approximate the pulsar magnetosphere by a rotating magnetic dipole field . in reality , the magnetosphere is known to be filled with plasma @xcite .",
    "this plasma is essentially force - free ( ff ) , satisfying @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the charge and current densities .",
    "the structure of the ff magnetosphere differs substantially from the rotating dipole field due to the poloidal current and the returning current sheet @xcite . recently ,",
    "ff magnetospheric field structure in 3d has become available from the time - dependent ff simulations @xcite .",
    "the ff magnetosphere satisfies @xmath3 everywhere , hence no particle acceleration or emission can formally occur .",
    "real pulsars must lie somewhere between the vacuum , which has @xmath4 everywhere , and ff cases .",
    "the fact that the power of gamma - ray emission is a small , though non - negligible ( @xmath5 ) , fraction of the total spin down power suggests that ff should be a reasonable approximation to the overall field structure with the exception of relatively small regions where acceleration takes place .    in the companion paper ( @xcite , hereafter bs10 )",
    ", we demonstrated that the modeling of gamma - ray pulsar light curves using the vacuum dipole field is subject to large uncertainties .",
    "this is because the peaks in the vacuum light curve are caused by the fortuitous overlap of radiation from different regions of the magnetosphere ( caustics ) .",
    "this overlap is sensitive to the geometry of the magnetic field due to two effects .",
    "first , the shape of the field controls how the aberration of light and light travel delay add together to cause the formation of caustics .",
    "we showed that a seemingly small change of treating the retarded vacuum field in the instantaneously corotating frame , rather than in the laboratory frame where it should be defined , can lead to significant reduction in the strength of caustics in the two - pole caustic / slot gap model and to the moderate dilution of the outer gap peaks .",
    "second , the behavior of the field near the light cylinder determines the shape of the polar cap on the star , and , hence , indirectly controls the shape of the emission zone , even if it is located in the inner magnetosphere .",
    "we considered the sensitivity of the caustic formation to the modification of shape of the vacuum polar cap .",
    "we compared the polar cap obtained by tracing the vacuum field lines to a simple circular polar cap .",
    "this change significantly affected the caustics of the two pole caustic model .",
    "the outer gap model was less sensitive to this change , but , since the emission zone for the outer gap is in the outer magnetosphere , the field shape there is likely to be strongly modified by the inclusion of plasma effects . given these uncertainties in the vacuum field modeling , it is highly desirable to revisit the existing models using the ff field configuration and compare the results with the latest observations .    in this paper",
    ", we use the force - free field from 3d time - dependent simulations by @xcite ( hereafter , s06 ) , and present the calculation of pulsar gamma - ray light curves using various theoretical models of emission . in  2 , we provide the general analysis of ff field structure , addressing the location of the current sheet and its association with magnetic field lines . in  3 , we describe our numerical method and theoretical models for calculating the gamma ray light curves .",
    " 4-6 are dedicated to comparison between different models .",
    "we show in  4 that the conventional two - pole caustic model fails to produce double - peak light curves using the ff field .",
    "we propose a novel  separatrix layer \" ( sl ) model in  5 , in which the emission zone is fixed in a layer just inside the separatrix associated with the strong current sheet .",
    "this layer can be accurately traced by open field lines originating in an annulus just inside the polar cap rim ) implies that the acceleration may not necessarily involve a  gap \" at all . ] .",
    "this model differs from the conventional tpc model in that the emission zone is not concentrated on the last open field lines , but rather interior to them , and it spans a larger range of heights up to and beyond the light cylinder .",
    "it differs from the conventional og model in that the emission zone consists of all field lines in a given flux tube , and not just those that cross the null charge surface .",
    "the double - peak light curve is a generic property of the ff field structure , where caustics of emission form in the outer magnetosphere when the field lines approach the split - monopolar geometry .",
    "we call this  the stagnation effect \" on the sky map . in  6 , we show that the conventional og model applied to ff field has difficulty in producing double - peak light curves unless a carefully chosen inclination angle and viewing geometry is used .",
    "we discuss various implications of our results to the pulsar acceleration mechanisms and compare our results with recent observations in  7 .",
    "the main results are summarized in  8 .",
    "force - free pulsar simulations evolve a rotating magnetized conducting sphere immersed in a massless infinitely conducting fluid .",
    "the simulations are three - dimensional ( 3d ) and start with an inclined dipolar field attached to a sphere ( s06 ) .",
    "the resolution of our simulations is @xmath6 cells per light cylinder ( lc ) radius , @xmath7 , and the radius of the star in simulations is 15 cells ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "we ran a series of simulations varying the inclination angle between pulsar s magnetic and rotation axes from @xmath9 to @xmath10 with an interval of @xmath11 .",

    "evolving for longer times makes little difference to the field structure @xcite . in  [ ssec : rhoj ] , we illustrate the charge density and current structure of the ff field , and present the properties of ff polar cap in  [ ssec : polarcap ] .",
    "the 3d current sheet structure of the ff field is discussed in  [ ssec : cusheet ] .      while it is not possible to determine individually the density and velocity of positively and negatively charged particles solely from the ff model , the ff current and charge density contain rich physical information from which we can gain useful insights .    in ideal force - free electrodynamics , by assuming that electromagnetic field pattern corotates with the pulsar , we obtain @xcite @xmath12 @xmath13=\\lambda{{\\boldsymbol}{b}}\\ , \\label{eq : ff2}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the normalized corotation velocity , and @xmath15 is a scalar function that is conserved along the magnetic field lines , because @xmath16 . in the case of the aligned rotator ,",
    "parameter @xmath15 is the analog of @xmath17 in the pulsar equation @xcite , where @xmath18 is proportional to the poloidal current , and the derivative is with respect to the poloidal magnetic flux @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , @xmath20 characterizes the current per magnetic flux .",
    "more specifically , positive @xmath15 represents current along the magnetic field line , while negative @xmath15 represents current flow opposite to the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "a formal derivation for the physical meaning of @xmath15 can be found in appendix [ app : derivation ] , where we show that @xmath21 is the field - aligned current density in the corotating frame .",
    "we calculate @xmath15 by taking the dot product of @xmath22 on both sides of equation ( [ eq : ff2 ] ) .        in figure",
    "[ fig : lamb ] , we show the color plots of @xmath15 in the @xmath23 plane ( the plane containing the rotation axis and the magnetic moment vector ) for a range of inclination angles .",
    "we also show vectors of the magnetic field projected onto this plane .",
    "the strong current layer manifests itself as a local enhancement of @xmath15 .",
    "first , consider the axisymmetric pulsar magnetosphere ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the field structure closely resembles the solution by @xcite with @xmath25 and well approaches the ckf solution the evolution of the y - point to the light cylinder takes longer than @xmath26 turns to approach the expected result ( s06 ) .",
    "larger inclination angles are well converged by @xmath27 turns .",
    "we have checked this convergence by comparing results between 1.2 turns and 2 turns ( where we manage to avoid reflection by using a very large computational domain ) .",
    "no significant difference is found for @xmath28 . in figures 1 - 4 , however , we do show the field structure after 2 turns , to allow the y - point in the @xmath9 case to get closer to the lc . ]",
    "@xcite . in agreement with these solutions ,",
    "the current along the open field lines in our simulation is predominantly of one sign in each hemisphere ; however , near the edge of the open zone there is a distributed return current region bounded by a strong return current sheet . instead of a delta - function current sheet expected in theory ,",
    "the simulation current sheet is several grid cells thick , giving @xmath15 a finite maximum / minimum there .",
    "the open field lines increasingly resemble the rotating split monopole solution beyond the lc and become radial in the poloidal section .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig : lamb ] illustrates these features .",
    "next , consider the general oblique rotators .",
    "the transition of current structure is smooth as @xmath29 increases from @xmath30 to @xmath31 . in figure",
    "[ fig : lamb ] , we see that at small inclination angle , @xmath32 , the pattern of @xmath15 is similar to the axisymmetric case , and the current sheet inside the lc appears slightly wider and weaker .",
    "as the inclination angle increases , there are also current sheet - like features inside the lc , but the distribution of current becomes very asymmetric , and more current is returned to the polar cap through the distributed flow rather than the current sheet .",
    "the current flow in the polar cap is predominantly of one sign ( e.g. , ingoing ) for the aligned rotator , bounded by a strong current sheet of opposite sign ( e.g. , outgoing ) , and is symmetric with respect to the equatorial plane .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath10 , the current flow has different signs in the northern and southern halves of the polar cap ( this can be better seen in figure [ fig : polarcap ] , which shows the current through the polar cap , see  [ ssec : polarcap ] ) , and the current distribution is anti - symmetric with respect to the equatorial plane . on the periphery of the polar cap",
    "there are thin current layers , as shown in red ( upper ) and blue ( lower ) oval structures in the right panel of figure [ fig : lamb ] .",
    "the current in these current layers forms loops connecting the two poles through the closed zone . integrating over the polar cap",
    ", we find that the amount of current flowing to the other pole is about @xmath33 of the current flowing on open field lines .",
    "such closed current loops for orthogonal rotators are qualitatively consistent with predictions of the model by @xcite , although we find the amount of current shunting to the other pole to be smaller in our simulations .",
    "the total current on the open field lines ( integrated by magnitude ) is just @xmath33 smaller for the orthogonal rotator than for the aligned rotator , suggesting that the current density for the orthogonal rotator exceeds the simple expectation of the speed of light times local goldreich - julian density on the polar cap .",
    "this current can not be provided by charge - separated flow alone and requires abundant pair formation .",
    "the details of the current adjustment in such polar caps are still uncertain @xcite .",
    "a thin current sheet _ outside _ the lc exists for all inclination angles ; its structure asymptotically approaches the rotating split monopole solution outlined by @xcite .",
    "if the current sheet outside the lc is connected to the star , it must be connected through a current sheet inside the lc , because the current flow in the cf can not cross magnetic field lines , as inferred from equation ( [ eq : lambda2 ] ) . in appendix",
    "[ app : cusheet ] , we show that the amount of current in the current sheet outside the lc that is connected to the star monotonically decreases with inclination angle . this is related to the degradation of the current sheet _ inside _ the lc and the thickening of the y - region for oblique rotators shown in figure [ fig : lamb ] .",
    "these features are unlikely to be caused by numerical resistivity , and we have tested that the thickness of the y - region and the strong current layers inside the lc is not sensitive to numerical resolution . for the orthogonal rotator , the current sheet outside the lc is totally disconnected from the star ( see appendix [ app : cusheet ] ) .",
    "therefore , the oval structures in the right panel of figure [ fig : lamb ] are most likely the current loops that connect the two poles , rather than current sheets connecting to the outer magnetosphere .",
    "this strongly contrasts with the case of the aligned rotator , where the current sheet inside the lc unambiguously exists and connects to the equatorial current sheet outside the lc . while there are definitely strong currents flowing on the periphery of the open field lines for all other inclinations seen from figure [ fig : lamb ] , determining whether their thickness is finite or infinitesimal would require further study ( see  [ ssec : polarcap ] for a speculative discussion ) . throughout this paper",
    ", we will refer to these current sheet - like features inside the lc as  strong current layers \" .",
    "the charge density necessary to provide corotation of the magnetosphere is referred to as goldreich - julian ( gj ) charge density @xcite .",
    "it can be written as @xmath34 if we assume complete charge separation , as in @xcite , then the second term is of the order @xmath35 , and we arrive at the classical result with @xmath36 . whether a real pulsar magnetosphere has complete charge separation is not clear , but the eclipse in the double pulsar system psr j0737 - 3039 indicates that the particle density in the inner magnetosphere is much higher than typical goldreich - julian density @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : rhob ] , we plot the charge density from the ff simulation .",
    "we find that the bulk distribution of ff charge density is approximately proportional to @xmath37 .",
    "however , there is a significant enhancement of charge density in the strong current layer and in the current sheet beyond the lc , which is due to the contribution of the current in the second term of equation ( [ eq : rho ] ) .",
    "the distribution of charge in the strong current layer inside the lc has another notable feature . in figure",
    "[ fig : rhob ] , the charge distribution is symmetric between the north and south magnetic hemispheres for the aligned rotator .",
    "dense negative charges more or less uniformly fill the current sheet inside the y - point , while the current sheet outside the y - point is positively charged @xcite .",
    "however , this symmetry is broken when @xmath29 is different from zero ( e.g. , at @xmath32 ) .",
    "the strong current layer inside the lc then contains both signs of charge , with the northern and southern parts having opposite sign at fixed azimuth .",
    "the current sheet outside the lc also contains charges of both signs , although one sign of charge is prevailing ( in red color ) .",
    "this trend is also observed by @xcite .",
    "it is also useful to visualize the ff magnetosphere in terms of space - like and time - like regions of 4-current .",
    "a 4-current is space - like if @xmath38 ; otherwise , it is time - like . note that this definition is lorentz invariant .",
    "regions with space - like current demand counter - streaming of different signs of charge in the frame where @xmath39 .",
    "this could lead to plasma instabilities and dissipation @xcite .",
    "a current sheet with space - like current could then be expected to produce particle acceleration and gamma - rays @xcite . in the asymptotic split - monopole regime of @xcite ,",
    "one expects the current sheet outside the lc to be space - like .",
    "this is because both magnetic and electric fields change sign across the current sheet , and since @xmath40 outside the current sheet , mhd jump condition demands @xmath41 in the current sheet , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are surface current and surface charge densities . in figure",
    "[ fig : netjb ] , we plot the lorentz invariant quantity @xmath44 where we take plus sign for time - like current , and minus sign for space - like current ; thus , counter - streaming is required in the regions which are negative .",
    "we find that in both aligned and oblique rotators the current sheet outside the lc is in general space - like ( blue ) .",
    "although there are regions in red around the current sheet , the overall surface integrated @xmath45 is negative , as expected .",
    "the strong current layer inside the lc appears to be predominantly time - like .",
    "the magnetosphere in the aligned rotator is dominated by time - like regions , and only in regions near the null charge surface does it show very small negative values of @xmath45 .",
    "as the inclination angle increases , the space - like region becomes much broader , occupying a substantial fraction of the open field - line regions .",
    "we will discuss this further in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the polar cap is the region on the neutron star ( ns ) surface where open magnetic field lines originate .",
    "the rim of the polar cap is set by the locus of last open field lines ( lofls ) .",
    "we adopt the conventional definition of lofls , where we treat a field line as open if it crosses the lc ; otherwise , it is regarded as closed .",
    "this is an oversimplification , as in ff field the closed zone does not have to extend to the lc everywhere ; some closed field lines may also extend through the lc and close through the current sheet .",
    "however , this simple definition facilitates comparison with calculations using the vacuum field . in figure",
    "[ fig : polarcap ] , we plot the shape of the ff polar cap on the sphere of radius @xmath46 for inclination angles @xmath47 .",
    "the surface of the sphere ( which is larger than the ns for ease of visualization ) is colored with the parameter @xmath15 , indicating the sense of the current flow . for comparison",
    ", we also plot with dash - dotted lines the polar caps obtained from the retarded vacuum magnetic dipole field @xcite .",
    "we note that tracing vacuum field lines beyond the lc always returns them back to the star , because vacuum solution does not have the current sheet .",
    "nevertheless , as is conventional in the literature , we always call vacuum field lines that go beyond the lc  open \" , although they are still formally closed .        from figure",
    "[ fig : polarcap ] we see that the polar cap of the ff field encloses the current flowing into and out of the pulsar . the polar current switches from flowing into the ns at @xmath9 , to equal halves of oppositely - directed current at @xmath10 .",
    "the peak of the current density slightly lags the zero phase ( i.e. , the phase of the magnetic pole ) due to pulsar rotation .",
    "the evolution of the strong current layer as @xmath29 increases can also be clearly seen from figure [ fig : polarcap ] . for aligned rotator",
    ", the rim of the polar cap corresponds to the footprint of the current sheet ( i.e. , the red enhancement on the left panel ) , as expected . as @xmath29 increases , the strong current thickens on one side ( lower side in figure [ fig : polarcap ] ) , and weakens on the other side .",
    "the thickened part may no longer count as a current sheet , as it gradually occupies half of the polar cap to become the main contributor of the polar current at @xmath10 .",
    "the weakened side gradually shifts to the outside of the polar cap ( at @xmath10 ) , and forms the current loop in the closed field lines as seen in the rightmost panel of figure [ fig : lamb ] . following the discussion in the previous subsection , we speculate that the weakened part of the strong current layer actually corresponds to the current sheet inside the lc .",
    "the current sheet covers a circle on the polar cap for the aligned rotator . for oblique rotators ,",
    "the region covered by the current sheet on the polar cap reduces to an arc covering the upper part of the polar cap in figure [ fig : polarcap ] .",
    "the extent of the arc - like region shrinks with inclination angle @xmath29 , consistent with the reduction of star - connecting current in the current sheet _",
    "outside _ the lc . in the mean time , some current in the arc - like region on the polar cap becomes connected to the other pole , forming current loops .",
    "this is associated with the thickening of the y - region discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "the loop current is zero for the aligned rotator , and increases to about @xmath33 of the total polar current for the orthogonal rotator .",
    "we note that the ff polar caps are smooth and approximately circular . on the other hand , polar caps obtained from oblique vacuum dipole rotators display notch structures and sharp jumps @xcite .",
    "as was shown in bs10 , gamma - ray light curves are sensitive to the shape of the polar caps , as this changes the formation of caustics in the emission .",
    "the ff polar cap is also larger than its vacuum counterpart , due to the larger open magnetic flux .",
    "this is consistent with the larger spin down power for force - free rotator compared to equivalent vacuum rotator ( s06 ) .",
    "the same effect is seen in the aligned rotator @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the lofls predicted from the vacuum dipole field should lie within the lofls , or in the open volume , of the ff field .",
    "this effect also has significant consequences to the appearance of the ff sky map .",
    "the magnetic field lines that originate near the polar cap from ns surface can be parameterized using the open volume coordinate system @xcite .",
    "this system has two coordinates , ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) , recording the footprint on the ns surface , where @xmath49 is the magnetic azimuth , and @xmath48 is the magnetic colatitude normalized by the magnetic colatitude of the lofls .",
    "therefore , the lofls correspond to @xmath50 , and open field lines have @xmath51 .",
    "current sheets are generic features of ff pulsar magnetosphere . to better visualize the current sheet structure , we present a volume rendering plot in figure [ fig : cusheet ] , showing the magnitude of the current function @xmath15 as volume opacity and two sets of flux tubes ( @xmath50 and @xmath52 ) as color lines .",
    "this figure demonstrates the relation between regions of strong current and magnetic field lines for @xmath53 rotator .",
    "first of all , we see that lofls are associated with the strong current layer inside the lc .",
    "note that the current layer has finite thickness , and it encloses the lofls . some field lines with @xmath54 and @xmath55 also lie within the strong current layer .",
    "moreover , due to magnetic reconnection in the current sheet ( outside the lc ) , field lines can be closed beyond the lc , and we observe that some outgoing field lines with @xmath56 stall and turn inward beyond the lc .",
    "these field lines trace the current sheet outside the lc to a finite distance before turning back .",
    "this effect makes finding the true lofls a more complicated exercise than we perform in this paper .",
    "secondly , we see that field lines with @xmath57 are generally open in the physical sense .",
    "red curves in figure [ fig : cusheet ] show some representative field lines with @xmath58 .",
    "these field lines lie at the edge of the strong current layer inside the lc , and follow closely the current sheet outside the lc . the current sheet outside the lc separates field lines originating from different poles .",
    "we conclude that @xmath48 is a good tracer of current in the ff magnetosphere . for @xmath53 rotator , strong current",
    "is associated with @xmath59 , and field lines with @xmath57 lie outside the current sheet . for other inclination angles ,",
    "the critical value of @xmath60 varies , but not significantly .",
    "the ff magnetosphere has no intrinsic acceleration and emission since the condition @xmath61 is satisfied everywhere by construction .",
    "therefore , we will calculate the pulsar gamma - ray emission based solely on geometric grounds .",
    "specifically , the calculation involves a prescription of the emission zone and a method to determine the intensity and direction of emission inside the emission zone .",
    "here we summarize the emission zone geometry prescriptions by different theoretical models that we consider in this paper .",
    "the two - pole caustic ( tpc ) model is an extended version of the slot - gap model ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this model ,",
    "the emission is assumed to originate on lofls ( i.e. , @xmath50 ) from the ns surface up to some cutoff radius @xcite .",
    "we use two cutoff radii : spherical radius @xmath62 , measured from the center of ns , and cylindrical radius @xmath63 , measured from the rotation axis .",
    "together , these two parameters define the extent of the tpc emission zone .    in this paper , we also propose a new emission model which we term the  separatrix layer \" ( sl ) model . in this model",
    ", we assume that emission comes from a layer in the vicinity of the separatrix , which separates open and closed field lines as well as field lines with different polaralities . as we have seen in ",
    "[ ssec : cusheet ] , the location of the separatrix corresponds to strong current layer / current sheet .",
    "this separatrix layer is described by @xmath64 , going from the stellar surface up to a cutoff radius in a way that is similar to the tpc model .",
    "the cutoff radii for sl model are not limited to be inside the light cylinder .",
    "we will discuss the physical justification for this model in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .    for the outer gap ( og ) model",
    ", the emission is assumed to originate on the open field lines beyond the null charge surface ( ncs ) , and extends up to the lc .",
    "recent refinements of the og models allow the inner boundary of the gamma - ray emission to be inside the ncs @xcite . in order to incorporate such possibility , we assume that the emission comes from all field lines in a given flux tube that cross the ncs , extending from the stellar surface to certain cut - off radius .",
    "this approach maximizes the volume of the emission zone . the emission from the og model is often assumed to be centered at certain @xmath48 ( e.g. , @xmath58 ) .    unlike the og model",
    ", the inner annular gap ( iag ) model assumes that particles are accelerated in an annular open field line region extending from the ns surface to the ncs @xcite .",
    "the emission zone is bounded by lofls and the critical field lines , which cross the lc at the ncs . to simplify",
    ", we may also think of emission from the iag to be centered at certain @xmath51 .    for all models mentioned above",
    ", we consider the emission originating from annular regions centered at fixed @xmath48 with a gaussian width @xmath65 similar to @xcite as our standard emission zone prescription .",
    "the radial extent of the emission zone is controlled by the location of the ncs ( for og and iag models ) , as well as the @xmath63 parameter ( we do not use @xmath62 in this paper ) .      in calculating the gamma - ray light curves we adopt two basic assumptions .",
    "first , we assume that the emission is produced by outgoing energetic particles in the emission zone .",
    "these particles are confined to travel almost along the magnetic field line , but may acquire some pitch angle @xmath66 .",
    "such pitch angle is expected from both conventional sg and og models , e.g. , acquired during the pair creation process @xcite , or via the cyclotron resonant absorption @xcite .",
    "if emission originates from the current sheet , as we postulate in  [ ssec : origin ] , we would expect even larger pitch angles since in the current sheet , magnetic field is relatively weak while the plasma is likely to be hot due to reconnection .",
    "the emission mechanism can involve synchrotron , curvature , and inverse - compton , but the direction of the emitted photon is along the direction of particle motion due to relativistic beaming .",
    "calculation of the direction of emitted photon in the lab frame ( lf ) , including the aberration and time delay effects , is discussed in detail in bs10 . here , we generalize these results to incorporate the effect of finite particle pitch angle . consider a drift frame ( df ) in which the electric field vanishes .",
    "let the velocity of the df relative to the lf be @xmath67 and @xmath68 . in this frame , let @xmath66 be the particle pitch angle .",
    "then the emission direction is determined by @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 are the tangential , normal and binormal unit vectors to the magnetic field line ( in the lf ) , and @xmath29 is determined by requiring that @xmath73 .",
    "this formula is essentially the same as equation ( 6 ) of @xcite , except that it applies in any drift frame .",
    "the drift velocity can be chosen to be either the corotation velocity @xmath74 , or the @xmath75 drift velocity .",
    "when @xmath76 , equation ( [ eq : ff1 ] ) ensures that these two choices produce the same result .",
    "however , this is no longer the case for finite pitch angle .",
    "this is because pitch angle is not lorentz invariant and depends on frames .",
    "moreover , the drift frame velocity with @xmath77 is no longer valid at @xmath78 since the frame velocity becomes superluminal .",
    "therefore , a better choice is to use the @xmath75 drift velocity , which is the minimum drift velocity among all dfs , and this is the drift velocity we adopt throughout this paper . in our calculation , we further assume that the pitch angle is constant for all particles in the emission zone .",
    "our second assumption is constant emissivity along particle trajectories in the emission zone . in reality ,",
    "as long as the particle emissivity does not vary dramatically in the emission zone , our calculation will be able to catch the overall features of gamma - ray light curves .",
    "moreover , as pointed out in bs10 , the overall appearance of the emission sky map is more sensitive to field structure , than to emissivity , because the formation of caustics largely depends on the details of field configuration .",
    "adopting constant particle emissivity will help us locate possible emission zones in ff field by comparing with observations .",
    "for example , comparing model light curves with observations can help identify the radial extent of the emission zone ( i.e. , @xmath63 , see  [ sec : ag ] ) , which then places constraint on the physics of radiation mechanism .    one basic difference in our approach compared to previous work ( e.g. , @xcite ) is that the emission is weighted by the length along particle trajectories rather than along magnetic field lines .",
    "we ve discussed in bs10 that particle trajectory follows magnetic field lines in the corotating frame ( cf ) , and the magnetic field in the cf is the same as lab frame ( lf ) magnetic field .",
    "therefore , to calculate particle trajectories , we trace magnetic field lines in the lf , and add the effect of stellar rotation . in appendix [ app : geometry ] we provide a simple relation between segment length along a magnetic field line and along the corresponding particle trajectory .",
    "the difference is small well inside the lc , but the correction becomes important near the lc and beyond . since ff field does not break down at the lc , we will allow the emission zone to extend beyond the lc , where such correction is necessary .",
    "finally , in our calculation photons from the emission zone are projected to the sky map ( @xmath79 ) , where @xmath80 corresponds to the rotation phase , and @xmath81 denotes the observer s viewing angle .",
    "a time delay correction is applied during the projection as usual @xmath82    the brightness of the sky map is proportional to the number of photons projected to the sky map bins , divided by the solid angle of each bin .",
    "the solid angle of each sky map bin is @xmath83 ; therefore , the sky map brightness is proportional to photon counts in each bin divided by @xmath84 .",
    "cutting the sky map at @xmath81 produces the light curve seen by the observer .",
    "the correction of @xmath85 only affects the normalization of the light curves at each observer viewing angle , but not the shape of the light curves . including it is important for the calculation of flux correction factor used to infer the intrinsic luminosity of gamma - ray pulsars .",
    "in this section we consider the emission from tpc model ( @xmath86 ) in ff field .",
    "the 3d shape of the last open field lines and the corresponding sky maps are shown in figure [ fig : tpcsm60_0 ] for inclination @xmath53 . in order to better see the origin of the sky map features , we mark different field lines with different colors in panels ( a ) and ( b ) , and use the same color convention to plot the sky map in panel ( c ) . to guide the eye , we also plot six color rings crossing the field lines in panels ( a ) , ( b ) and their projections onto the sky map in panel ( c ) .",
    "points on each ring are located at fixed distance , @xmath87 , from the center of ns , measured _ along _ the field lines .",
    "the six rings span from @xmath88 to @xmath89 with an interval of @xmath46 . as the size of the star in the simulation is relatively large , @xmath90 , tracing emission from the surface out would leave large gaps on the sky map surrounding the poles . to fill these gaps , we add tracing of radiation from inside the star , where we impose a vacuum dipole field down to the radius @xmath91 .",
    "this makes for effective size of the star for the purposes of sky map calculation to be @xmath92 . as ff field",
    "is nearly dipolar close to the star , the matching to the vacuum field is easy to achieve . in panel ( d ) , we make the line plot of the sky map as in panel ( c ) , but the lines are colored with the value of 4-current length @xmath45 , defined in equation ( [ eq : netj ] ) . since current drops rapidly with radius , the actual color scale is set by @xmath93 .",
    "note that in this panel , @xmath94 corresponds to the middle of the color bar .",
    "the black semi - circles around the pole indicate the size of the star in the simulation @xmath95 . at smaller radii , where the ff field is not available",
    ", @xmath45 is taken to be zero .",
    "panels ( e ) and ( f ) display the brightness of the sky map . note that panel ( e ) shows the sky map brightness from the north pole only , as in all previous panels , while panel ( f ) is a complete sky map containing both poles . in calculating the sky map brightness , the synchrotron pitch angle @xmath66 is taken to be zero .",
    "first of all , the pattern of the sky map from the ff field , as seen in figure [ fig : tpcsm60_0 ] , is very different from the sky map from tpc model using the vacuum magnetic field ( @xcite ; see also fig .",
    "[ fig : vacsm ] below ) .",
    "as noted in bs10 , the aberration formula used in earlier works needs to be corrected , and this reduces the strength and increases the width of the caustics .",
    "the ff sky map here is also very different from the corrected vacuum sky map ( see figure 4b , 4d of bs10 , or fig . [",
    "fig : vacsm ] below ) .",
    "the main differences include : 1 ) there is no caustic or local enhancement produced near the ns ; 2 ) all caustics are formed near the lc .",
    "it is important to understand why the ff field gives such dramatically different appearance of the sky map even though the structure of the ff field is similar to that of the vacuum field close to the star .",
    "we find that this effect can be attributed to the shape of the polar cap .",
    "recall that in figure [ fig : polarcap ] , the ff polar cap is more circular than its vacuum counterpart .",
    "more importantly , the ff polar cap is larger .",
    "the caustics in the vacuum field are significant in the open field line region , but weaken toward the lofls , tending to disappear if the emission is calculated from the field lines further in the closed zone .",
    "as the larger ff polar cap encloses the vacuum polar cap , the last open field lines of ff would map into the closed field zone of the vacuum magnetosphere .",
    "this explains the lack of caustics close to the ns surface using the ff field .",
    "next we discuss the structure of the ff sky map for the tpc model ( fig . [",
    "fig : tpcsm60_0 ] ) .",
    "each pole contributes to two main caustic structures .",
    "for the field lines coming from the north pole ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tpcsm60_0]c - e ) , the location of the caustics roughly coincides with the green ring , and in the sky map it appears as a broad arc ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tpcsm60_0]e ) . at early phases ( @xmath96 ) ,",
    "the caustic is mainly caused by the sweepback of field lines on the sky map ( yellow field lines in fig . [",
    "fig : tpcsm60_0]a - c ) .",
    "this caustic is relatively weak and narrow . at later phases",
    ", there is a bright  knot \" where emissions from neighboring field lines cross each other on the sky map ( near the intersection of light blue field lines and the red or green rings in fig .",
    "[ fig : tpcsm60_0]c ) .",
    "this knot and the adjacent region contribute to the most of the second caustic , which is brighter and wider . the knot can also be seen in panel ( a ) , where light blue field lines fall close to each other .",
    "there is large shear between neighboring field lines , corresponding to large current flow .",
    "the field lines resulting in the knot enter the current sheet , and this feature persists in many different simulations .    adding the emission from both poles",
    ", there can be up to four peaks in the gamma - ray light curve .",
    "a large fraction of the area of the sky map includes contributions from both poles .",
    "besides the two bright caustics , emission from other regions is mostly smooth , except in regions close to the lc [ e.g. , the tips of red and cyan lines in panel ( a ) ] . comparing with figure [ fig : cusheet ] , we find that these regions are deeply embedded in the strong current layer , where the field structure may not be well resolved in the simulation .     and observer viewing angles @xmath97 .",
    "the corresponding sky maps are shown on the left .",
    "emission zone is centered on lofls , extending to lc . a synchrotron pitch angle @xmath98 is applied .",
    "the curves at the same @xmath29 have the same normalization.,width=321 ]    figure [ fig : tpclc_10 ] shows a gallery of representative light curves predicted from the tpc model in ff field for different inclination angles and observer viewing angles . in this plot we have chosen @xmath98 to show the effect of non - zero pitch angle .",
    "we see that this smoothes the sky map substantially , as can be seen by comparing the @xmath53 sky map in this figure with figure [ fig : tpcsm60_0 ] .",
    "nevertheless , the light curves generally exhibit irregular shapes with up to 4 peaks .",
    "the central part of the light curves is typically brighter because both poles contribute . the caustic structure due to field line sweepback is smoothed and mixed with the overlapping region from another pole , while the caustic from the vicinity of the  knot \" is still prominent .",
    "also note that some of the troughs in the light curves are due to the finite size of the poles .    comparing the light curves of figure [ fig : tpclc_10 ] with observations , one generally fails to obtain a clean double - peak profile . at larger inclination angles ,",
    "the trend is to have two very broad humps instead of narrow peaks .",
    "we have tried to restrict the geometry of the emission zone by tuning the parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and found that they do not improve this situation .",
    "moreover , we have also considered simulations with higher resolution and different diffusivity ; the appearance of the sky map and the bulk behavior of the light curves does not change qualitatively between different runs .",
    "the difficulties in obtaining double - peaked light curves from last open field lines with the two - pole caustic model in ff field caused us to consider different locations for the emission region . in this section ,",
    "we study the emission from a set of field lines in the open volume that are still close to the lofls .",
    "this is motivated by the distributed nature of the return current in oblique rotators .",
    "we will refer to this model as the  separatrix layer \" ( sl ) , as the emission region is concentrated in a layer in the vicinity of the separatrix . in practice , we choose @xmath99 for the sl model . in figure",
    "[ fig : agsm60_90 ] , we plot the field lines and the corresponding sky maps with @xmath100 , for inclination @xmath53 .",
    "the emission zone extends from the ns surface to cylindrical cut - off radius @xmath101 .",
    "we organize the six panels in the same way as in figure [ fig : tpcsm60_0 ] .",
    "the sl model produces two bright and narrow caustics on the sky map . comparing the tpc sky map with that of the sl model ( i.e. , moving from @xmath86 to @xmath100 )",
    ", we see that the weak caustic due to field line sweepback on the left of figure [ fig : tpcsm60_0]c no longer exists , while the caustic associated with the  knot \" has evolved to a strong caustic spanning a large portion of observer s viewing angle .",
    "the  knot \" is no longer present .",
    "combining the contribution from the two poles gives rise to two caustics in panel ( f ) .",
    "the origin of the caustics can be traced from panels ( a ) to ( c ) : we clearly see that the red , green , blue and black rings overlap at the locations of strong caustics .",
    "therefore , the formation of the caustics is not due to the coincidence that emission from _ different _ field lines congregates on the sky map ( as is the case for caustics in the vacuum field form ) , but the emission from _",
    "one _ field line arrives simultaneously , piling up on the sky map .",
    "we call this effect  sky map stagnation \" ( sms ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : agsm60_90 ] , we see that sms starts to develop at a distance from the star along field lines of @xmath102 ( beyond the red ring ) .",
    "this corresponds to the outer magnetosphere .",
    "the sms phenomenon covers about one half ( @xmath103 radians ) of magnetic azimuth on each pole .",
    "therefore , the full caustic structure caused by sms sweeps a large fraction of the sky map , giving rise to two sharp peaks in the resultant light curve .    in appendix",
    "[ app : stagnation ] we show that sms is a natural consequence of the rotating split monopole solution of @xcite .",
    "the direction of particle motion in this field is exactly radially outward , and the winding of the field lines into spirals compensates for the time delay effect .",
    "the ff field of the aligned rotator @xcite approaches the split monopole solution beyond the lc .",
    "the oblique rotator also asymptotes to the inclined split monopole solution ( @xcite , s06 ) , and this causes the caustics in a general ff field . to check this",
    ", we have examined the field geometry of open field lines near and beyond lc .",
    "we find that the field resembles well the split monopole field .",
    "the deviations , which are stronger for lines with larger @xmath48 , prevent sms from occurring on all open field lines .",
    "we note , that split monopole field is just one out of many field line configurations that can result in sky map stagnation ( see appendix [ app : stagnation ] ) .",
    "we also constructed sky maps from different open volume coordinates , ranging from @xmath60 to @xmath104 .",
    "we find that for smaller values of @xmath48 the sms behavior is stronger . at @xmath104 ,",
    "sms is achieved for all field lines .",
    "this suggests that as we shift towards the center of the open flux tube , the split monopole solution provides a better approximation of the field geometry ( see also figure [ fig : rov_cmp ] ) .",
    "we also examined the sky map from other inclination angles ranging from @xmath105 to @xmath31 ( see also figure [ fig : aglc_10 ] below ) .",
    "we find that sms is in fact a general feature of the ff field .",
    "one consequence of sms is that the intensity of the caustics is proportional to the length of particle trajectories within the emission zone , if emissivity is constant along the trajectory .",
    "we have chosen to cut off the radiation at @xmath101 , which is arbitrary .",
    "choosing larger cutoff radius will result in brighter peaks , and vice versa . as emphasized in  [ sec : model ] , we have used the assumption of constant emissivity along particle trajectories rather than field lines .",
    "the two different treatments do not produce significant differences at radii of order of @xmath106 ( our approach gives slightly fainter peaks ) ; nevertheless , this approach is more self - consistent , and sets the framework for future work ( e.g. , spectral calculations ) .",
    "another consequence of sms is that the curvature radius @xmath107 of the particle trajectories becomes much larger than the curvature radius of magnetic field lines .",
    "one extreme example is the curvature radius of the trajectory in split monopolar field , which equals infinity , even though the field lines are curved .",
    "we have calculated @xmath107 along the open field lines of the ff field ( see appendix [ app : geometry ] for methodology ) , and found that @xmath107 generally increases as particle travels farther along the field line , and can reach about @xmath108 at the lc .",
    "such large curvature radius makes curvature radiation potentially inefficient , and a non - zero pitch angle helps with radiation efficiency , which justifies our inclusion of this effect .",
    "we comment on the inner annular gap ( iag ) model by @xcite .",
    "the choice of @xmath58 is consistent with the iag region .",
    "however , the emission of the iag model is thought to originate relatively close to the ns surface , up to the null charge surface ( ncs ) .",
    "as seen from figure [ fig : tpcsm60_0 ] , no caustic can form in the inner region of the magnetosphere since the field line is still far from approaching the asymptotic split monopole regime .",
    "the iag model also suffers from the more serious problem that only a small fraction of field lines cross the ncs ( see  [ sec : og ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : aglc_10 ] collects the light curves of the sl model for five different inclination angles and four observer viewing angles . the emission is centered on @xmath100 ( for @xmath32 and @xmath109 ) and at @xmath60 ( for @xmath53 , @xmath110 and @xmath31 ) .",
    "the emission is prescribed up to cylindrical radius @xmath111 . due to sms ,",
    "the intensity of the calculated light curves depends on how far the emission is traced . to examine the relative importance of emission contributed from different regions",
    ", we also plot the light curves originating from within cylindrical radius @xmath112 , indicated as grey lines .",
    "there are several features worth noting as we discuss below .",
    "first , we see that the double peak structure is a common feature for most of the light curves .",
    "similar to the conventional tpc and og models using the vacuum field ( @xcite ) , the double peak feature is most likely to appear at relatively large @xmath29 and @xmath97 .",
    "second , we see that emission outside the lc dominates the peak brightness , while the bridge emission is from inside the lc .",
    "this is expected from sms . as a consequence ,",
    "the intensity contrast at peak and bridge reflects how far the separatrix layer extends beyond the lc . for many viewing angles , the first peak tends to be stronger than the second peak .",
    "this is due to our assumption of constant emissivity and simplified choice of emission zone boundaries .",
    "more physics has to be included to accurately constrain the peak intensities .",
    "finally , without smoothing due to the non - zero pitch angle , the sms tends to produce reflection - asymmetric light curves .",
    "that is , both peaks have a sharp rise and a relatively smooth decay .",
    "this appears to be inconsistent with some of the observed gamma - ray pulsar light curves [ e.g. , light curve of the vela pulsar @xcite , which has a  horn \" structure , symmetric upon reflection around the middle of the bridge ] . by adding a small pitch angle , the force - free light curves are smoothed and become more reflection - symmetric ( e.g. , the light curve with @xmath53 and @xmath113 ) .    .",
    "the inclination angle is @xmath114 .",
    "field lines are traced to @xmath115 except for @xmath86 which is traced to @xmath116 .",
    "@xmath98 is used for all plos . on the right",
    "shows the light curves with @xmath117.,width=340 ]    it remains to explain why we choose @xmath48 between @xmath118 and @xmath119 , justifying the emission zone as being in the  separatrix layer \" . in figure",
    "[ fig : rov_cmp ] , we show a series of sky maps with inclination @xmath114 from @xmath120 to @xmath86 , using @xmath98 smoothing . from the top panel , we see that at small @xmath48 sms develops on all field lines , but only covers a relatively small fraction of the sky map .",
    "emission from two poles does not overlap .",
    "consequently , 4 peaks appear in typical light curves .",
    "as one increases @xmath48 , on the one hand , the sky map coverage from each pole increases , reducing the gap region between the two poles ; on the other hand , the number of field lines that exhibit sms decreases , reducing the intensity of two of the four peaks . at around @xmath58 to @xmath119 , emission from both poles starts to overlap on the sky map , and sms remains strong for a number of field lines . upon increasing @xmath48",
    "further towards last open field lines , a significant fraction of the sky map is contributed to by two poles , sms weakens , and the prominent  knot \" appears .",
    "a similar trend is observed for simulations with other inclination angles .    in sum",
    ", we have shown that the separatrix layer model with @xmath48 between @xmath118 and @xmath119 is capable of producing double peak light curves in a wide range of geometric parameters .",
    "we will discuss the origin of sl emission in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the fact that the emission zone responsible for the caustics in the separatrix layer scenario is located in the outer magnetosphere is reminiscent of the outer gap model .",
    "however , there are two key differences between the sl model and the conventional og .",
    "first , the og model is based on the charge - separated magnetosphere , where the formation of the gap is thought to occur only on field lines that cross the ncs . on the other hand",
    ", the sl model assumes that the emission zone extends all the way from the stellar surface to beyond the light cylinder on all field lines at a given open volume flux surface , regardless of whether these lines cross the ncs .",
    "second , at a fixed line of sight , most emission , especially the two peaks , are contributed by one pole in the conventional og model . in contrast , in the above sl model , both poles contribute to the observed emission , particularly , with each pole contributing one peak .",
    "this is similar to the tpc model .",
    ", but for the og model , and emission zone is centered on @xmath58.,width=321 ]    in this section we discuss the sky maps and light curves from the og model using the ff field",
    ". a key ingredient of the og model is the null charge surface ( ncs ) , which determines both the radiating field lines and the extent of emission on these field lines . in the case of vacuum dipole field , ncs is simply the surface where @xmath121 . as a result ,",
    "emission from the north pole mostly contributes to the @xmath122 portion of the sky map , and the south pole mainly contributes to the other half . in the ff magnetosphere , we can determine the ncs by finding where @xmath123 .",
    "guided by the recent work that proposed shifting the inner boundary of the og towards the star ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we allow emission from the full length of each field line that crosses the ncs .",
    "this does not result in extraneous peaks as can happen in the vacuum field , but just maximizes the sky map coverage of the og model , improving the bridge emission .    in figure",
    "[ fig : oglc_10 ] , we show the sky map of the og model for ff field with @xmath58 . because the separatrix layer model includes emission from _ all _ field lines with this @xmath48 ,",
    "the sky map of the og model is simply a subset of that of the sl model .",
    "in fact , figure [ fig : oglc_10 ] is just part of figure [ fig : aglc_10 ] , except the value of @xmath48 there is slightly different ( @xmath52 vs @xmath119 ) .",
    "assigning emission only to ncs - crossing field lines almost always eliminates one peak from the light curve .",
    "the remaining peak is from the sms effect of the south pole .",
    "the north pole contributes very little to the light curves .",
    "the reason for the elimination of one peak in the og model is best seen in figure [ fig : agsm60_90 ] of the previous section . in panel ( d ) , the location of the ncs on the sky map from the north pole is indicated by grey dots .",
    "we can see that only a fraction of field lines cross the ncs .",
    "these field lines span roughly @xmath124 in magnetic azimuth on the polar cap .",
    "this is to be compared with case of the vacuum field , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : vacsm ] , where for similar geometry , almost all field lines cross the @xmath125 surface ( presumably the ncs ) eventually .",
    "for the same @xmath48 , the ff field lines are ",
    "straighter \" than their vacuum counterparts , and a large fraction of them do not turn horizontal inside the lc ( e.g. , compare lines marked with circles in figs .",
    "[ fig : agsm60_90 ] and [ fig : vacsm ] ) .",
    "therefore , using the ff field , half of the field lines end up being non - emitting under the framework of the og model ) in figure [ fig : agsm60_90 ] is simply taken from the first term on the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : rho ] ) ; therefore , the grey dots inside the black circle are roughly a straight line at @xmath126 ( corresponding to @xmath121 ) . outside the black circle ,",
    "the grey dots are generally below @xmath126 , indicating that the location of the ncs in the ff field is further out than determined from the classical @xmath127 criterion .",
    "the difference is more significant in regions marked with diamonds than regions marked with asterisks .",
    "although there is a jump in the location of the ncs on the left of panel ( d ) in figure [ fig : agsm60_90 ] due to the large size of the star in the simulation , it is also clear from the plot that it does not affect our selection of ncs - crossing field lines . ] .",
    "consequently , half of the bright caustics in panel ( e ) of figure [ fig : agsm60_90 ] are missing . combining the two poles ,",
    "there is only one bright peak left .",
    "this is a dramatic difference from the results using the vacuum field .    in figure",
    "[ fig : oglc_10 ] we confirm that for all inclination angles , most of the light curves have only one prominent peak . in many of these light curves , the shape of the peak as well as",
    "the bridge emission is very similar to those produced by the og model using the vacuum field , but the second peak is missing , or degrades into a weak hump .",
    "the weak hump is produced from the same pole as the main caustic , and mostly due to the continuation of the main caustic ( e.g. , the panel with @xmath128 @xmath113 ) .",
    "given the weakness of the hump , it is unlikely to play an important role when more physics is added to relax the assumption of constant emissivity .",
    "in addition , we have experimented with the effect of inward emission .",
    "this effect was used in the original version of the og model @xcite , and re - considered in @xcite .",
    "we find that the inward emission itself will produce two peaks whose shapes are similar to the conventional og model using the vacuum field .",
    "both peaks are relatively weak , and the bridge emission is almost half the brightness of the peaks .",
    "more problematically , the first peak lags the radio peak by more than @xmath124 .",
    "adding to this the main peak from the outward emission , there can be three peaks in total .",
    "therefore , inward emission appears unlikely to play an important role .",
    "we have shown that using the ff field , conventional tpc and og model no longer work as well as in previous calculations using the vacuum dipole field . alternatively , we find that the separatrix layer model , where emission comes from open field lines that lie just in the vicinity of the separatrix ( including the strong current layer inside the lc and the current sheet outside the lc ) , is very promising in reproducing the prevailing double peak features of gamma - ray pulsar light curves .",
    "this model works due to the sky map stagnation effect , that is unique to ff field and occurs as the field becomes increasingly split - monopolar with radius .",
    "our calculations of the sl model in ",
    "[ sec : ag ] work mainly on the geometric grounds with little physical input . in this section",
    "we discuss the implications of these results to pulsar gamma - ray radiation mechanism , and compare our results with observational data .",
    "the ff field provides a more realistic model for the pulsar magnetosphere than vacuum field because it takes into account the field distortions due to self - consistent currents caused by pulsar spin down .",
    "the basic assumption of the force - free approximation is that pair creation is so efficient that it fills the magnetosphere with abundant pair plasma to make it a perfect conductor everywhere .",
    "real pulsar magnetospheres are more complicated due to dissipation and reconnection in the current sheet , formation of gaps , and the presence of differential rotation @xcite .",
    "one way of testing the robustness of the result obtained in this paper is to consider fields from strong - field electrodynamics ( sfe ) introduced by @xcite , which generalizes the ff equations to include dissipation . in sfe",
    ", the ff condition @xmath61 is relaxed in space - like regions , where the ohmic dissipation is present , while time - like regions are still non - dissipative .",
    "the dissipation and reconnection in the ff current sheet may be better modeled with sfe .",
    "in addition , vacuum gaps in pulsar magnetosphere may also be considered as dissipative regions , where @xmath129 .",
    "we have implemented sfe formulation into our ff code by replacing the ff current by the sfe current [ see equation ( 6 ) of @xcite ] .",
    "the conductivity scalar @xmath130 is taken to be constant . the natural scale of @xmath43 is @xmath131 , which we denote by @xmath132 .",
    "we have run our simulation with different values of @xmath43 around 1 .",
    "we find that the overall field configuration is more smooth than the ff field configuration .",
    "particularly , the  knot \" in the sky map from lofls which penetrate the current sheet becomes less prominent .",
    "the strong current layer inside the lc is not changed qualitatively , but the current sheet outside the lc is smoothed appreciably .",
    "more energy is dissipated in the magnetosphere , and the total poynting flux decreases by about @xmath133 over about @xmath134 .    despite the fact that sfe produces smoother magnetospheric structure , we find that the resulting sky maps and light curves do not differ qualitatively from the results with the ff field presented in this paper .",
    "therefore , we believe that our result is robust and may also be applicable to dissipative magnetospheres with moderate levels of dissipation .",
    "we have shown that if pulsar high - energy emission originates from open field line regions in the vicinity of the separatrix , extending from the ns surface to beyond the lc , two bright caustics will form due to sky map stagnation .",
    "currently , there is no theory directly pointing to the existence of the sl emission ; however , based on the geometric location of the sl , there are clues about its origin .    \\1 . modified sg / tpc model .",
    "we note that sms is already significant at @xmath60 , which is very close to lofls .",
    "also , in our calculation , the emission zone is assumed to have a gaussian profile with width @xmath65 centered on @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , the edge of the emission zone can be considered on the lofls .",
    "this emission zone geometry is consistent with the sg model .",
    "therefore , if the thickness of the pair formation front is as large as @xmath135 , a modified sg model may be able to produce the desired two peak light curves .",
    "such sg must extend at least to the lc to produce sharp peaks .",
    "recent sg / tpc models consider emission from smaller @xmath48 flux tubes ( e.g. , @xcite ) . given that in ff field only the field lines with @xmath136 are truly open and",
    "do not close through the current sheet , it is likely that at least geometrically the sl model can be considered as an extension of tpc and invokes the same field lines .",
    "the physical reason for the acceleration on these lines is unlikely to be a slot gap , however , and is more related to reconnection in the current sheet , as discussed below .",
    "2 . modified og model .",
    "another clue comes from the distribution of space - like regions in the magnetosphere .",
    "regions of space - like 4-current , which are likely to develop instabilities and could have accelerating fields @xcite , are preferentially located beyond the ncs .",
    "similar locations are typically invoked in og models , although for reasons that rely on complete charge separation in the magnetosphere .",
    "even if og - type model can be justified based on the sign of 4-current , it would not be sufficient to produce two peaks  the emission has to come from more field lines than those crossing the ncs .",
    "interestingly , looking at figure [ fig : agsm60_90]d , the regions showing the pile - up due to sms have values of @xmath45 near zero , or negative .",
    "if small positive values of @xmath45 can also cause acceleration , this could explain the emission from the whole flux tube .",
    "association with the strong current",
    ". the presence of a strong current layer within the lc and a current sheet beyond lc are general features of ff field .",
    "strong dissipation and reconnection is expected in such regions @xcite , and the energy release can reach a few percent of the spin down power , probably radiated in x - rays and gamma rays @xcite . using bogovalov s ( 1999 ) current sheet solution for the inclined split - monopole , @xcite were able to reproduce the typical double - peak light curves , indicating that the field configuration around the current sheet beyond the lc is also geometrically favored .",
    "based on the same model , @xcite and @xcite further reasonably well reproduced the optical polarization of the crab pulsar and phase - resolved spectrum for the geminga pulsar .",
    "our result that the sl emission zone resides in the vicinity of the strong current layer and/or current sheet ( see figure [ fig : cusheet ] ) implies a connection with the strong current . at higher inclinations ,",
    "the return current becomes increasingly distributed over the open flux , and it is possible that some of the acceleration takes place on the open field lines .",
    "also , the caustics of emission form in the outer magnetosphere , and the acceleration on these field lines can be affected by the proximity of the y - point .",
    "reconnection near the y - point ( or  y - ring \" in 3d ) can load the open field lines with plasma , and cause field - aligned accelerating fields , akin to auroral double - layers ( @xcite ) .",
    "emission from the equatorial current sheet beyond the lc can also be important , as the field lines we invoke for sl trace close to the current sheet in the wind zone .",
    "modeling emission from the current sheet itself is more complicated in ff simulation , since ideal mhd does nt apply in the current sheet , and the magnetic field direction abruptly changes in the unresolved current sheet , which leads to tracing errors .",
    "this will be studied more in future work .",
    "the facts that the bulk of the sl emission is formed at and beyond the lc , and that emission from two poles overlaps on the sky map and forms two peaks only close to the edge of the open flux tube ( for @xmath137 , figure [ fig : rov_cmp ] ) , suggests that the current sheet beyond the lc is responsible for the large part of gamma - ray emission .",
    "our discussion on the origin of the sl model is highly speculative .",
    "a detailed theory of the electrodynamics of current sheets has to be constructed to test these scenarios and uncover the origin of the sl emission .",
    "one year after launch , _ fermi _ lat has greatly expanded the number of detected gamma - ray pulsars either by identifying previously unresolved / unidentified sources ( e.g. , known radio pulsars , millisecond pulsars ( msp ) , egret sources , supernova remnants ( snr ) , pulsar wind nebulae ( pwn ) , @xcite ) , or by the blind search of lat sources @xcite .",
    "together with previously known gamma - ray pulsar data , a sample of more than 40 gamma - ray pulsars is now available @xcite , allowing more systematic comparison between observations and theoretical models .    under the framework of the sl model with ff field",
    ", the double - peak light curves can be produced over a large range of geometric parameters , as shown in ",
    "[ sec : ag ] .",
    "as a geometric model , it provides robust prediction on the temporal location of the two peaks regardless of the input physics .",
    "the phase lag of the first peak relative to the radio peak ( which likely coincides with the location of the polar cap on the sky map ) ranges from about @xmath138 to larger than @xmath139 , and the separation between the two peaks ranges from zero ( i.e. , one peak ) to @xmath140 .",
    "smaller phase lag typically corresponds to larger separation , and vice versa , as seen from the caustic structure from figure [ fig : aglc_10 ] .",
    "also , larger inclination angles tend to result in larger peak separation .",
    "statistically , our model predicts that the majority of light curves should have widely - separated double peaks , pulsars with smaller peak separation are less common , pulsars with only one peak are possible but rare .",
    "another consequence of the sl model is that smaller peak separation usually indicates stronger bridge emission between the peaks .",
    "the best example of this can be drawn from the light curve with @xmath141 , @xmath113 in fig .",
    "[ fig : aglc_10 ] .    based on the current data sample of gamma - ray pulsars ,",
    "the majority of them show widely separated double - peak pulse profiles , in good agreement with the sl model .",
    "a small fraction shows double peaks with smaller separation [ e.g. , b1716 - 44 @xcite , j0007 + 7303 , j1459 - 60 , j1741 - 0254 @xcite ] , but with relatively strong bridge emission , also in qualitative agreement with our result .",
    "a few objects show only one peak [ e.g. , j0357 + 32 @xcite , psr 0437 - 4715 , psr 0613 - 0200 @xcite , j2229 + 6114 @xcite ] .",
    "such pulse profiles may be obtained when the observer s line of sight tangentially cuts through the caustics on the sky map ( examples include @xmath142 in figure [ fig : aglc_10 ] ) .",
    "the small number of such pulsars agrees with the small chance of such tangential incidence .",
    "noticeably , the fraction of single peak msps appears to be higher than for normal gamma - ray pulsars @xcite .",
    "this may reflect the fact that msps tend to have smaller inclination angle which increases the chance of tangential incidence . given the relatively old age of the msp population",
    ", their smaller inclination angle might be caused by alignment torques @xcite .",
    "the distribution of phase lags from the sl model is not directly comparable with the latest data since most new gamma - ray pulsars are radio - quiet .",
    "for available radio - loud pulsars , we find some agreement , but not always .",
    "for example , the phase separation between peaks in b1706 - 44 appears to be too small to fit our model , as both peaks come in the first half of the rotation .",
    "there may be an additional phase lag from the radio peak due to high altitude radio emission from energetic pulsars @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is uncertain whether observed phase lag can be used as a reliable diagnostics .",
    "this paper is concerned with high - energy emission from gamma - ray pulsars modeled by the force - free ( ff ) field .",
    "the ff field takes into account the effect of conducting plasma , and the charges and currents are solved self - consistently using time - dependent simulations . by construction , the ff magnetosphere does not emit because @xmath61 everywhere , but it provides a more realistic approximation to the field structure .",
    "the ff field differs substantially from the vacuum dipole field in several ways .",
    "first , there is a larger magnetic flux on the open field lines . as a result , the polar cap is larger than the vacuum polar cap .",
    "second , beyond the lc , ff field has a strong current sheet and field lines approach inclined rotating split - monopole shape . inside the lc ,",
    "there is a strong current layer coinciding with the last open field lines .",
    "this layer is a thin current sheet for the aligned rotator , which connects to the current sheet outside the lc .",
    "the amount of current carried by the current sheet inside the lc decreases with the inclination angle .",
    "the inner current sheet disappears completely for the orthogonal rotator .",
    "current distribution on the polar cap varies with @xmath29 , with larger fraction of the current closing through the polar cap at larger inclinations , rather than in a thin boundary layer .",
    "third , the charge distribution in the ff magnetosphere contains significant concentration of charge in the current sheet / strong current layer , and the charge distribution in the current sheet for the aligned rotator is substantially different from that of the oblique rotators .",
    "moreover , the null charge surface ( ncs ) is no longer determined by @xmath125 , and a large fraction of open field lines does not cross the ncs at all .",
    "fourth , the 4-current in substantial fraction of the ff magnetosphere is space - like , requiring the presence of charges of both signs , which is inconsistent with completely charge - separated picture .",
    "the differences in the field structure of ff and vacuum fields give rise to substantial differences in resulting theoretical light curves .",
    "the polar cap in the ff magnetosphere is more circular and larger than the vacuum polar cap .",
    "therefore , close to the star , the location of lofls of the ff field corresponds to closed field line regions in the vacuum field . due to this effect ,",
    "the caustics seen in the two - pole caustic ( tpc ) model using the vacuum field no longer exist in force - free field . instead , the pattern on the sky map is more complicated : up to four peaks ( caustics ) may exist , and a large fraction of the sky map is covered by emission from both poles .",
    "in addition , there is a bright  knot \" region on the sky map associated with the strong current . in any case , we find it difficult to reproduce the typical double - peak profile in the resulting light curves using the tpc model .    we have shown that if we relax the emission zone in the tpc model into a separatrix layer ( sl ) , where the emission comes from the open field line regions near the strong current layer / current sheet and extends from the ns surface up to and beyond the lc , two bright caustics will appear .",
    "the cause of the caustics is completely different from that in the case of a vacuum field . for a large fraction of open field lines in the outer magnetosphere",
    ", the emission from different heights along the field line piles up at the same spot on the sky map , which strongly enhances the sky map brightness at that location .",
    "this effect , which we call  sky map stagnation \" ( sms ) , is due to the fact that the ff field asymptotically approaches the split monopole field at large radii . as a result",
    ", the intensity of the caustics due to sms effect is determined by the extent of the emission zone .",
    "the typical feature of the light curves from this sl model is two sharp peaks with more or less uniform off - peak emission .",
    "each pole contributes to one peak .",
    "the rise of the peak is usually sharp while the drop is more smooth . adding the effect of non - zero pitch angle smoothes the sky map .",
    "this model provides robust prediction on the location and the separation of the two peaks , and the resulting light curves match the general features of most observed gamma - ray pulsar light curves .",
    "although there is no theory predicting the existence of this separatrix layer emission , its location in the pulsar magnetosphere strongly suggests its association with the strong current layer and/or current sheet , particularly the current sheet beyond the light cylinder .",
    "the sky map from the og model can be considered as part of the sl model , restricted only to field lines that cross the ncs .",
    "we find , however , almost always that only one peak can form .",
    "the reason is that a substantial fraction of the open field lines do not cross the ncs at all .",
    "the coverage of the emission on the sky map is similar to that of vacuum field , but the formation of caustics is due to sms .",
    "some gamma - ray pulsars recently observed by _",
    "telescope show only one prominent peak , and the og model using the ff field may be relevant to such pulsars .",
    "the  inner annular gap \" ( iag ) model also relies on field lines that cross the ncs , and thus suffers the same problem as the og model .",
    "however , because the emission zone in the iag model is relatively close to the ns , where sms does not develop , it will be even more difficult to produce any peaks with this model using ff field .    in constructing models of the emission zones",
    ", we assigned emission to flux tubes concentric to the last open field lines .",
    "this can be an oversimplification , and the actual emitting flux tube can have a more complicated shape .",
    "this is particularly so if reconnection in the y - point region affects neighboring field lines in the outer magnetosphere .",
    "the origin of those field lines on the polar cap does not have to be concentric to lofls .",
    "an avenue that we have yet to explore in detail is to assign emission not per field line , but in the whole volume of the magnetosphere , weighted by some proxy of the magnetospheric dissipation , such as the strength of the current .",
    "the gross features of the force - free sky maps , such as the caustic formation in the outer magnetosphere due to sky map stagnation will likely remain the same ; however , quantitative shape of the light curves may be affected .",
    "this will be the subject of future work .",
    "in addition , our modeling of pulsar s high - energy emission assumes constant emissivity along particle trajectories , which works on purely geometric basis and serves as the first step in comparing different theoretical models and identifying possible regions of emission .",
    "more physics input is needed for a consistent study of pulsar s high - energy emission that would reveal the origin of pulsar magnetospheric accelerator .",

    "since they are not connected to the star , it becomes clear that there is no current sheet in the inner magnetosphere for the orthogonal rotator .     as a function of magnetic inclination angle @xmath29 .",

    "we consider particles with zero pitch angle .",
    "the discussion here is valid so far as particle pitch angle is small , as we use in this paper .",
    "the direction of particle motion consists of a combination of @xmath75 drift velocity ( or corotation velocity ) and velocity parallel to the magnetic field @xmath194 where @xmath195 is the unit vector parallel to the magnetic field line ( without loss of generality , hereafter we assume the radial component of @xmath70 points outward ) , and @xmath29 or @xmath196 are obtained by requiring @xmath73 : @xmath197 where the plus / minus signs correspond to trajectories along / opposite to magnetic field line .",
    "usually , we expect @xmath198 due to field sweepback",
    ". therefore , the outgoing particles always have @xmath199 , and are expected to have @xmath200 ( for reference , split monopole field has @xmath201 ) . for ingoing particles , however , @xmath196 is positive inside the lc , negative outside the lc .",
    "this means that ingoing particles can return to the star _",
    "only _ if they are generated inside the lc .",
    "below we consider only the outgoing particles , taking the plus sign in the equations above .",
    "particle trajectories can be obtained by tracing the direction of motion while rotating the star at the same time . since @xmath202 has a corotation component , equations ( [ eq : a1 ] )",
    "ensure that particle trajectories follow the field lines exactly in the corotating frame ( cf ) .",
    "although this is obvious , we still go through the proof , which will be useful for numerical calculations of curvature radius of particle trajectories .",
    "the proof is best demonstrated in a graphical view . in equation ( [ eq : a1 ] ) , the vector equation forms a triangle as shown in figure [ fig : geometry ] . the length of each edge is expressed in terms of velocity . multiplying each of the edges by an amount of time @xmath203 , we obtain another interpretation of the graph .",
    "the upper edge gives an infinitesimal segment length @xmath204 along particle trajectory in the direction of @xmath202 .",
    "the lower edge becomes @xmath205 , which marks the corresponding segment length along the magnetic field line . as the particle travels by @xmath206 , the star ( and the field lines ) rotate by an angle @xmath207 .",
    "therefore , the entire field line is shifted by @xmath208 in the azimuthal direction , this corresponds to the right edge .",
    "now we ve obtained a closed triangle that is similar to the original velocity triangle .",
    "based on this new interpretation , we conclude that particle trajectory follows the magnetic field line exactly in the cf .",
    "the fact that particle trajectories follow cf magnetic field lines as well as the similarity relations from the velocity and segment triangles provide a natural way to reconstruct particle trajectory .",
    "the key relation is between @xmath206 and @xmath209 , which satisfies @xmath210 in practice , we originally have a series of segment lengths along field lines @xmath211 $ ] . from this formula ,",
    "one can obtain a series of segment lengths of the corresponding particle trajectory @xmath212 $ ] .",
    "this further provides the phase of rotation as the particle travels , @xmath213 $ ] . finally , particle trajectory can be reconstructed by rotating each point on the magnetic field line by @xmath213 $ ] .",
    "it is then straightforward to ( numerically ) calculate the curvature radius of the particle trajectory .",
    "when performing the calculation , however , there can be cases where the square root in equation ( [ eq : a2 ] ) becomes imaginary .",
    "this always happens in the vacuum dipole field once the particle travels out of the lc ; it also happens occasionally in the current sheet since the ideal mhd does nt apply there and one does not expect equation ( [ eq : a1 ] ) to hold .",
    "moreover , across the ff current sheet , the toroidal component of the magnetic field changes sign , resulting in ambiguity in defining  ingoing \" and  outgoing \" directions . in such regions , the proposed ",
    "outgoing \" particles may have @xmath214 , which is not desired .",
    "therefore , we modify equation ( [ eq : a3 ] ) into @xmath215 in calculating @xmath196 , if the terms under the square root is negative , we just take them to be zero .",
    "one can further show the analytical expression for the curvature radius of particle trajectory based on the discussions above : @xmath216 numerical experiments show that curvature radius obtained from this approach has very similar accuracy as the first method .",
    "according to the formula of aberration ( [ eq : a1 ] ) and time delay ( [ eq : tdelay ] ) , the condition for emission along a magnetic field line to become stagnant on the sky map is @xmath217 where @xmath218 denotes the azimuthal angle of the emission direction @xmath219 .      note that the emission direction depends only on the direction of the magnetic field , but not its strength .",
    "therefore , the only variable left is the direction of the field , which has two degrees of freedom .",
    "the above are two independent equations for @xmath154 .",
    "therefore , the direction of @xmath154 can be uniquely determined from equations ( [ eq : stagnant ] ) , if initial condition is given .",
    "nevertheless , the equations above are still too complicated to solve analytically . instead of solving the equations directly , we test certain field geometries to see if the stagnation condition is satisfied .",
    "we consider the split monopole field ( [ eq : monopole ] ) and show that it does indeed satisfy equations ( [ eq : stagnant ] ) .",
    "according to equation ( [ eq : a1 ] ) , the emission direction from split monopole is exactly along the radial direction @xmath221 .",
    "since the strength @xmath222 and sign @xmath223 have nothing to do with the emission direction @xmath224 , we can safely omit it in the calculations below .",
    "now we substitute the split monopole field into these conditions .",
    "the first equation in ( [ eq : stagnant ] ) becomes @xmath225 .",
    "note that @xmath226 ; therefore , this condition is satisfied . for equation ( [ eq : stag2 ] ) , the first term is just @xmath227 , while the second term can be shown to be equal to @xmath228 , and they sum to zero .",
    "therefore , emission from any _ one _ field line in the split monopole field is projected exactly to the same point on the sky map .    obviously , the split monopole is not the only possible solution to equations ( [ eq : stagnant ] ) .",
    "it only corresponds to a special initial condition .",
    "in fact , we see in figure [ fig : agsm60_90 ] that at @xmath100 , sms starts to develop from inside the lc , where the ff field still deviates from the split monopole solution .",
    "nevertheless , sms is much easier to achieve at smaller @xmath48 ( see figure [ fig : rov_cmp ] ) , or at larger radii ( @xmath229 ) .",
    "the fact that the ff solution approaches the inclined split monopole asymptote @xcite , as well as the observation of sms strongly suggest its connection to the split monopole field geometry at large radii .",

    "<S> we propose a novel  separatrix layer \" model , where the high - energy emission originates from a thin layer on the open field lines just inside of the separatrix that bounds the open flux tube . </S>",
    "<S> the emission from this layer generates two strong caustics on the sky map due to the effect we term  sky map stagnation \" ( sms ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is related to the fact that the force - free field asymptotically approaches the field of a rotating split monopole , and the photons emitted on such field lines in the outer magnetosphere arrive to the observer in phase . </S>",
    "<S> the double - peak light curve is a natural consequence of sms . </S>",
    "<S> we show that most features of the currently available gamma - ray pulsar light curves can be reasonably well reproduced and explained with the separatrix layer model using the force - free field . </S>",
    "<S> association of the emission region with the current sheet will guide more detailed future studies of the magnetospheric acceleration physics . </S>"
