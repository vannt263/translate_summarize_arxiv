    "one of the challenging issues of the sc mechanism is the origin of the pg .",
    "the pg phase is detected in the underdoped region , which has been interpreted in terms of preformed pairs@xcite , a circulating current phase@xcite and many more . in many cuprate superconductors@xcite in the underdoped region ,",
    "the static stripe phases play an important role , which may be incommensurate unidirectional spin and charge - density waves@xcite .",
    "also it has been reported that bismuth - based cuprates conventionally exhibit the `` out - of plane disorder , '' which strongly affects superconducting transition temperature t@xmath4@xcite .",
    "this suggests that the out - of plane disorder is a potentially important factor concerning the superconducting properties of high - t@xmath4 superconductors and hence it proves the importance of jahn - teller effect .",
    "the dependence of the sc transition temperature on the structural properties is little understood for the high temperature sc compounds . in this system ,",
    "the fermi level ( fl ) lies within the degenerate band of the two orbitals .",
    "the molecular distortion is produced when the electronic degeneracy is removed by some symmetry breaking interactions .",
    "this type of distortion is called jahn - teller distortion .",
    "there is a change in the electronic density of states ( dos ) around the fl associated with such a transition .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the band jahn - teller ( bjt ) distortion would strongly influence the superconductivity in such a system .",
    "there is a large number of experimental evidences indicating the strong influence of the structural distortion on the sc transition temperature .",
    "the neutron scattering measurements of the temperature dependence of the spontaneous strain have been reported by paul @xmath5@xcite for @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the system exhibits a structural transition at @xmath8 .",
    "the magnitude of the strain rises on lowering the temperature and shows an anomalous suppression below @xmath9 .",
    "this anomaly is expected to be associated with the appearance of the superconductivity in the system .",
    "the evidence for such interplay between lattice distortion and superconductivity in @xmath10 , @xmath11 and even in electron doped cuprate system @xmath12 has been reported by lang @xmath5@xcite from thermal expansion measurements . moreover ,",
    "the suppression of the lattice distortion in the sc state has also been observed for @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xmath15-superconductors as shown by extended x - ray absorption measurements@xcite .",
    "further , the structural transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic phase in @xmath10 takes place at temperatures higher than the sc transition temperature .",
    "the doping dependence of the transition temperature t@xmath4 is also reported for @xmath16 ( m  =  ca , sr)@xcite .",
    "these measurements clearly demonstrate that there exists a strong interplay between superconductivity and structural distortion .",
    "the introduction of an electron - phonon mechanism that can achieve high - t@xmath4 superconductivity is challenging in the theoretical point of view .",
    "for the theoretical study of the high - t@xmath4 superconductivity the onsite and/or intersite bipolarons , jt bipolarons and different mechanisms@xcite of carrier dynamics such as bose - einstein condensation and tunneling - percolation have been proposed .",
    "the jt polaron pairing effect was originally proposed as a possible explanation for the superconductivity in @xmath6 by bednorz and mu@xmath17ller@xcite . since",
    "then this effect has been discussed by a number of authors in different contexts@xcite and many features have been observed experimentally supporting the general concept of jt effect@xcite .",
    "a dynamic jahn - teller effect arises , when there is a degeneracy in both of electronic levels and of molecular vibrations and when two independent distortions have the same jt energy lowering .",

    "is described in section 2 . in the dynamic limit calculation ,",
    "the electron green s functions are calculated and solved in such a way that it gives rise to the modified bcs gap equation .",
    "the lattice strain relation is calculated in section 3 , the results and discussion are presented in section 4 and finally the conclusion is given in section 5 .",
    "the present model study attempts to investigate the effect of djt distortion on the superconducting gap in high - t@xmath4 superconductors ( htss ) .",
    "if the fermi level lies on a degenerate conduction band and the degeneracy is removed by lowering of the lattice symmetry , a spontaneous lattice strain is produced in the band resulting in the structural transition .",
    "this strain in the band is stabilized , if the gain in electronic energy overcomes the cost in elastic energy .",
    "depending on the magnitude of the lattice distortion , the system can behave as a metal or insulator .",

    "the lattice distortion is enhanced resulting in the suppression @xmath136 .",
    "we report here a model study to treat the static and dynamic jahn - teller effects on high temperature copper oxide superconductors .",
    "the static jt effects are considered as the renormalization to the energy of the doubly degenerate conduction electron bands .",
    "further , the dynamic jt effects renormalize both the conduction bands as well as the superconducting gap parameter under lattice strain through the electron - phonon coupling constant .",
    "the solutions are obtained by using the zubarev double time green s function methods including the higher order mixing green s functions within mean - field approximations .",
    "we observe the changes in lattice strain , when the temperature decreases to below sc transition temperature @xmath136 , as observed by the calculation of ghosh @xmath185@xcite .",
    "further , we observe here some new results beyond mean - field approximation in a generalized model .    in the model calculation for the gap equation for the high - t@xmath4 cuprates",
    ", we have considered the jahn - teller type lattice strain as a pseudogap interacting strongly with the superconducting pairing amplitudes .",
    "the static lattice strain suppresses the superconducting gap as reported by the neutron scattering studies and the theoretical calculations@xcite . keeping in mind the important role played by the pg , we consider here the djt effect on the superconducting gap in high - t@xmath4 systems .",
    "in addition to the static band jahn - teller effect , we incorporate the normal phonon interaction to the electron densities of the degenerate conduction band and the djt interaction to the difference in electron densities of the jt splitted two bands .",
    "the superconducting gap equation is calculated by the zubarev s technique of green s functions and the modified bcs gap equation is calculated from the modified conduction band energy @xmath1 and the modified sc gap parameter @xmath186 .",
    "the lattice strain is calculated by minimizing the free energy .",
    "the sc gap and jt energy gap equations are solved self - consistently .",
    "it is observed that the sc gap and the sc transition temperature are enhanced by the djt interaction as compared to the static case .",
    "the normal ep coupling suppresses the jt distortion temperature and enhances the sc transition temperature .",
    "similarly , for smaller djt coupling @xmath187 , the jt distortion temperature is suppressed , while the sc transition temperature is enhanced . for higher values of the djt coupling @xmath188",
    ", the jt distortion is suppressed , but the sc transition is not enhanced further . it is found that the external frequency suppresses the jt transition temperature but enhances the sc transition temperature for frequencies @xmath189 .",
    "it is further noticed that both the jt distortion temperature and the sc transition temperature are enhanced for the lower values of the phonon vibrational frequencies , while both the transition temperatures are not affected by the higher phonon vibrational frequencies .",
    "the electronic correlation effects and the @xmath46-wave symmetry are not discussed in the present model calculations .",
    "the present model study helps in understanding the interesting phenomenon of the interplay of dynamic structural transition with the superconductivity in cuprate systems .",
    "however , it will be interesting to study , how the antiferromagnetism spin fluctuations leading to @xmath46-wave pairing superconductivity will be influenced by the dynamic structural distortion",
    ". this will be the subject matter for a future study .",
    "the authors gracefully acknowledge the research facilities offered by the institute of physics , bhubaneswar , india during their short stay .",
