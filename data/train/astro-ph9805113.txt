    "one of the most compelling puzzles in present day astronomy is the question how galaxies formed . in particular , we need to understand the wide variety of sizes , masses and morphologies of galaxies observed , as well as their dynamics , ages and metallicities . in addition , we need to understand the origin of the scaling relations , such as the fundamental plane relations for ellipticals and the tully - fisher relation for spirals , as well as the so - called density - morphology relation ( dressler 1980 ) .",
    "the latter shows that the more compact galaxies , such as ellipticals and s0s , are preferentially found in overdense regions such as galaxy clusters .",
    "the classical way of depicting the different morphologies of galaxies is by means of the hubble diagram , which reveals the gross distinction of three sorts of galaxies : spirals , s0s , and ellipticals .",
    "several studies over the past years have shown that elliptical galaxies can be roughly divided in two subclasses : the rotation supported , low luminosity disky ellipticals and the pressure supported , bright , boxy ellipticals ( e.g. , bender 1988 ; bender et al .",
    "1989 ; capaccioli , caon & rampazzo 1990 ) .",
    "this dichotomy has recently been strengthened by properties observed in their central regions ( e.g. , nieto , bender & surma 1991 ; jaffe et al .",
    "1994 ; ferrarese et al .  1994 ; gebhardt et al .  1996",
    "; faber et al .",
    "1997 ) . based on this dichotomy amongst elliptical galaxies",
    ", it has been suggested that the classical hubble diagram should be revised ( kormendy & bender 1996 ) , to use a more physical subdivision of the class of the ellipticals , rather than the apparent flattening .",
    "kormendy & bender proposed to use the velocity anisotropy which is well measured by the isophote shapes ( bender 1988 ; bender et al .",
    "1989 ) .",
    "the main morphological parameter that sets the classification of galaxies in the ( revised ) hubble diagram is the disk - to - bulge ratio @xmath2 .",
    "understanding the origin of the hubble sequence is thus intimately related to understanding the parameters and processes that determine the ratio between the masses of disk and bulge .",
    "the diskiness of the low luminosity ellipticals is generally interpreted as due to an embedded disk .",
    "these disks , which we term ` embedded disks ' in the following , are smaller and brighter than disks in s0s and spirals ( scorza & bender 1995 ) , and it has been emphasized many times that the disky ellipticals build a continuous sequence with s0 galaxies ( capaccioli 1987 ; carter 1987 ; bender 1988 , 1990 ; van den bergh 1990 : capaccioli et al .  1990 ; rix & white 1990 ; capaccioli & caon 1992 ; bender et al .",
    "1993 ; scorza & bender 1995 , 1996 ; scorza & van den bosch 1998 ) .",
    "this continuity suggests similar formation histories , whereby one or several parameters of the proto - galaxy vary smoothly .",
    "disk dominated systems such as spirals are believed to have formed by cooling of the baryonic matter inside a virialized dark halo . as the gas cools , its specific angular momentum is conserved , and the amount of angular momentum of the dark halo thus determines the size of the disk ( fall & efstathiou 1980 ; see section  2 for more details on this disk - formation scenario ) . the formation of bulge dominated disk systems is far less clear .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate to what extent the disky ellipticals and s0s can be incorporated in the fall & efstathiou theory for the formation of galactic disks , by incorporating a simple picture for the formation of the bulge .",
    "we envision an inside - out formation scenario for the bulge .",
    "it is assumed that the bulge forms out of the low - angular momentum material in the halo , which cools and tries to settle into a small , compact disk .",
    "such disks are however unstable , and we assume here that this instability , coupled with the continuous supply of new layers of baryonic matter that cool and collapse , forms the bulge .",
    "this inside - out bulge formation is self - regulated in that the bulge grows until it is massive enough to allow the remaining gas to form a stable disk component .",
    "we do not describe the bulge formation in any detail but merely use empirical relations of the characteristic structural parameters of bulges and ellipticals to describe the end result of the formation process as a realistic galaxy .",
    "we use this simple formation scenario to investigate the predicted disk - to - bulge ratios and disk scale - lengths as a function of the halo angular momentum , and as a function of formation redshift and cosmology .",
    "the main focus of this paper is to investigate whether this inside - out formation scenario can account for two orders of magnitude variation in disk - to - bulge ratio , required in order to incorporate a wide variety of disk - bulge systems : from late - type spirals with @xmath3 to s0s ( @xmath4 ) to disky ellipticals ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we describe the formation scenario , the galaxy formation efficiency , and the stability criterion for our disk - bulge - halo models . in section  3",
    "we use these models to investigate the position of different sorts of disks in the parameter space of disk central surface brightness versus disk scale - length . in section  4",
    "we discuss to what extent s0s and disky ellipticals can be incorporated in this formation scenario , and what parameters may be responsible for the origin of ( the major part of ) the hubble sequence . in section  5",
    "we briefly discuss alternative formation scenarios for disky ellipticals .",
    "our results are summarized and discussed in section  6 .",
    "a remarkably successful model for the formation of galaxies is the white & rees ( 1978 ) theory , wherein galaxies form through the hierarchical clustering of dark matter and subsequent dissipational settling of gaseous matter within the dark halo cores . coupled with the notion of angular momentum gain by tidal torques induced by nearby proto - galaxies ( hoyle 1953 ; peebles 1969 )",
    ", the white & rees theory provides the background for a model for the formation of galactic disks ( fall & efstathiou 1980 ; faber 1982 ; gunn 1982 ; fall 1983 ; van der kruit 1987 ) . in this model ,",
    "disks form through the collapse of a uniformly rotating proto - galaxy . owing to the non - dissipative character of the dark matter , its collapse halts when the system virializes . at regions where the baryonic density is high enough",
    ", the baryons can cool and decouple from the dark matter .",
    "the angular momentum of the baryons , acquired from tidal torques from nearby proto - galaxies , prevents the collapse from proceeding all the way to the center , and causes the baryons to settle in a rapidly rotating disk .",
    "this simple picture of disk formation yields realistic disk sizes and surface brightness profiles provided that there is little angular momentum transfer from the baryonic matter to the dark halo , and that the dark halo has a density profile such that the resulting galaxy has a flat rotation curve . fall ( 1983 )",
    "extended the original fall & efstathiou disk formation scenario by placing it in a cosmological context , and by deriving freeman s law ( freeman 1970 ) and the tully - fisher relation .",
    "recently , two papers reexamined this disk formation model and included the effects of halo - contraction due to the accumulation of baryonic matter in the center of the galaxy : dalcanton , spergel & summers ( 1997 ) showed that the disk formation model outlined above can not only explain the properties of normal , high surface brightness ( hsb ) disks , but also those of the class of low surface brightness ( lsb ) disks ( see also jimenez et al .",
    "1998 ) ; mo , mao & white ( 1998 ) compared the outcome of disks in different cosmologies , and used this to investigate the effects of disk evolution and the predicted population of ly@xmath5 absorbers in qso spectra .",
    "the assumptions we make are similar to those made by dalcanton et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and mo et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , but we extend upon their work by including bulges .",
    "we investigate how the disky ellipticals and s0s may be fitted into this particular formation scenario , by comparing the differences in properties of the proto - galaxies that result in spirals , s0s , and disky ellipticals .",
    "the turn - around , virialization , and subsequent dissipational settling of the baryonic matter of a proto - galaxy is an inside - out process .",
    "first the innermost shells virialize and heat its baryonic material to the virial temperature .",
    "because of the relatively high density and low angular momentum of this gas , it will rapidly cool and ( try to ) settle in a very small , compact disk .",
    "however , self - gravitating disks are violently unstable and form a bar ( e.g. , hohl 1971 ; ostriker & peebles 1973 ) . meanwhile the next shell of the proto - galaxy cools and tries to settle into a disk structure at a radius determined by its angular momentum .",
    "the resulting structure in the center of the dark halo consequently becomes more and more unstable .",
    "bars are efficient in transporting gas inwards ( e.g. , friedli & martinet 1993 ; wada & habe 1995 ) , and can cause vertical heating by means of a collective bending instability ( e.g. , combes et al .",
    "1990 ; pfenniger 1984 ; pfenniger & friedli 1991 ; raha et al .",
    "both these process lead ultimately to the dissolution of the bar ; first the bar takes a hotter and triaxial shape , but is later on transformed in a spheroidal bulge component ( e.g. , combes et al .",
    "1990 ; pfenniger & norman 1990 ; pfenniger & friedli 1991 ; pfenniger 1993 ; friedli 1994 ; martinet 1995 ; norman , sellwood & hasan 1996 ) . here",
    "we assume that this bar instability and subsequent dissolution , coupled with the continuous supply of new layers of baryonic matter that cool and collapse , forms the bulge .",
    "the numerical simulations performed by the numerous studies listed above , have been able to show that bars can build small and close to exponential bulges ( see also courteau , de jong & broeils 1996 for observational evidence for bulge formation out of disks ) .",
    "however , no simulations have been able to use bar instabilities to produce very large bulges or even ellipticals . on the other hand",
    ", all these simulations started from a normal , marginally unstable disk , whereas the process we are describing starts from a highly unstable , compact disk , includes the continuous supply of baryonic matter from prolonged cooling flows , and is likely to have additional heating sources due to the star formation and feedback processes which are expected to take place in this phase of the bulge formation .",
    "detailed numerical simulations that take all these processes into account are required in order to investigate whether this can indeed lead to massive bulges as assumed here .",
    "finally , we emphasize that the high densities of the inner shells yield cooling time - scales that may be significantly shorter than the dynamical time - scale .",
    "this can add to the inside - out formation of a bulge component , as suggested by kepner ( 1997 ) .",
    "we assume that the bulge formation process discussed above continuous until the bulge has become massive enough such that the subsequent layers of baryonic material can cool and form a disk which is stable against bar - formation .",
    "the process of disk - bulge formation is thus a self - regulating one in that the bulge grows until it is massive enough to sustain the remaining gas in the form of a stable disk . since the stability is directly related to the amount of angular momentum of the gas ( see section  2.4 ) , we expect a clear correlation between the disk - to - bulge ratio and the angular momentum of the dark halo out of which the galaxy is assembled",
    ". we will show that this correlation is present , and that it nicely follows the marginal stability curve as expected from the self - regulating mechanism proposed here .",
    "the galaxies under investigation in this paper , varying from spirals to disky ellipticals , are assumed to consist of a disk plus bulge embedded in a dark halo .",
    "virialized dark halos can be quantified by a mass @xmath6 , a radius @xmath7 , and an angular momentum @xmath8 ( originating from cosmological torques ) .",
    "spherical collapse models ( e.g. , gunn & gott 1972 ) show that virialized halos have an over - density of approximately 200 . in a recent series of papers navarro , frenk & white ( 1995 ; 1996 ; 1997 , hereafter nfw ) showed that virialized dark halos have universal equilibrium density profiles , independent of mass or cosmology ( but see moore et al .",
    "1997 ) , which can be well fit by @xmath9 where @xmath10 with @xmath11 the concentration parameter , @xmath12 a scale radius , and @xmath13 the critical density for closure .",
    "the radius @xmath7 is defined as the limiting radius of a virialized halo , and corresponds to the radius within which the mean density is @xmath14 .",
    "throughout we only consider spherical halos .",
    "rather than specifying the halo by its mass @xmath6 , it is customary to specify it by its circular velocity @xmath15 .",
    "given the mass @xmath6 , the formation redshift @xmath16 , and the specific cosmology , the concentration parameter @xmath17 can be calculated using the procedure outlined in appendix a of navarro , frenk & white ( 1997 ) . in this paper",
    "we compare two different cosmologies : a standard cold dark matter cosmology ( scdm ) with a total matter density of @xmath18 , a hubble constant of @xmath19 with @xmath20 , and with a rms linear over - density at @xmath21 in spheres of radius @xmath22 mpc of @xmath23 .",
    "this latter parameter normalizes the cdm power spectrum .",
    "the second cosmology discussed here is an open cold dark matter model ( ocdm ) with @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "both models have a zero cosmological constant and the parameters are typical of those favored by large - scale structure constraints .",
    "the baryon density is set to be @xmath27 , in agreement with the nucleosynthesis constraints ( e.g. , walker et al .",
    "1991 ) . the baryonic mass fraction is then given by @xmath28 .",
    "we assume the final system to have a disk - to - bulge ratio @xmath29 , such that the masses of disk , @xmath30 , and bulge , @xmath31 , can be written as @xmath32 and @xmath33 here @xmath34 is the galaxy formation efficiency , expressed as the fraction of the available baryons that ultimately end up in the galaxy ( see section  2.3 ) . as mentioned in section  2.1 , we assume that the bulge is formed out of the low - angular momentum material .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the material that builds the disk does not loose its specific angular momentum . under these conditions we have that @xmath35 , where @xmath36.\\ ] ] the function @xmath37 depends on the disk - to - bulge ratio and on the detailed physics that describe how the fraction @xmath34 of the baryonic material ends up in the disk - bulge system ( see section  2.3 ) .",
    "this function is derived in the appendix . in the following we parameterize @xmath8 by the dimensionless spin parameter @xmath38 , defined by @xmath39 here @xmath40 is the halo s total energy .",
    "several studies , both analytical and numerical , have shown that the distribution of spin angular momentum of collapsed dark matter halos is well approximated by a log normal distribution : @xmath41 ( e.g. , barnes & efstathiou 1987 ; ryden 1988 ; cole & lacey 1996 ; warren et al",
    ".  1992 ) .",
    "we consider a distribution that peaks around @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
    "these values are in good agreement with the @xmath44-body results of warren et al .",
    "( 1992 ) .",
    "we assume the disk to be an infinitesimally thin exponential disk , with surface brightness @xmath45 and total luminosity @xmath46 in order to convert the disk parameters to an observers frame we need to assume a mass - to - light ratio @xmath47 .",

    "the parameter @xmath62 is determined by the requirement that @xmath58 is the radius encircling half of the total luminosity and is very well approximated by @xmath63 ( ciotti 1991 ) .",
    "the total luminosity of a system with a @xmath55 luminosity profile ( assuming sphericity ) is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the gamma function .",
    "it was found that the best fitting exponent @xmath59 is correlated with the total luminosity of the spheroid : andredakis , peletier & balcells ( 1995 ) used the @xmath55 law to fit the luminosity profiles of bulges of spiral galaxies , and found the effective radius @xmath58 to be related to the total luminosity of the bulge by the empirical relation @xmath66 in addition , caon , capaccioli & donofrio ( 1993 ) found that the exponent @xmath59 is correlated with the effective radius through the empirical relation @xmath67 although this empirical relation has only been shown to fit early - type galaxies , we assume here that it is also valid for bulges .",
    "we take @xmath59 to be limited between @xmath60 ( exponential ) and @xmath61 ( de vaucouleurs ) .",
    "none of our results are significantly influenced by this assumption however .",
    "the main parameter for the bulge is its total mass ; changes in its actual density distribution are only a second order effect .",
    "the relations ( [ sigbulge ] )  ( [ nbulge ] ) allow us to describe the bulges by a single parameter ; once the total luminosity of the bulge is known , we can use the empirical relations to determine all other bulge parameters !",
    "van der marel ( 1991 ) found that ellipticals have @xmath68 ( johnson @xmath69 ) . using @xmath70 ( e.g. , van der marel 1991 ) and",
    "@xmath71 this yields @xmath72 in the @xmath53-band . for our combined disk - bulge model",
    "we assume that the mass - to - light ratio is constant over the entire galaxy with a value equal to the luminosity weighted average of the mass - to - light ratios of the disk and bulge .",
    "alternatively , we could have assigned the bulge and disk separate mass - to - light ratios of @xmath47 and @xmath73 respectively , but the mass - to - light ratio of the disks in s0s and disky ellipticals is clearly larger than for spiral discs . assuming a constant , luminosity weighted ratio is thus more realistic .",

    "convergence is rapidly achieved : 3 to 5 iterations yield an accuracy of @xmath97 already better than one percent .",
    "since we have defined the mass of the dark halo such that the average over - density of the halo is 200 times the critical density for closure at the virialization redshift @xmath100 , we have that @xmath101 this halo mass can be related to the disk luminosity ( assuming no bulge , i.e. , @xmath102 ) , by @xmath103 ( cf .",

    "mao , mo & white 1997 ) .",
    "in other words , if we assume a significant scatter in the formation redshifts of spiral galaxies ( some massive spirals are already in place at @xmath108 , see vogt et al .",
    "1996 ) , the dependence of equation ( [ modtf ] ) would yield a scatter in the tully - fisher relation much larger than observed : if spirals form between @xmath21 and @xmath109 ( and they are not significantly modified since their formation ) a scatter of @xmath110 mag is predicted for an einstein - de sitter universe , much larger than the observed scatter of @xmath111 mag .",
    "this suggests that the redshift dependence of the tully - fisher zero - point has to be corrected for by either imposing @xmath112 or @xmath113 .",

    "here we assumed that the hi - linewidth equals twice the circular velocity @xmath120 .",

    "here @xmath122 , with @xmath123 the cosmological constant . in the scdm model with @xmath20 and @xmath18 ,",
    "equation ( [ diskefb ] ) yields @xmath124 .",
    "galaxies that were assembled at higher redshift thus formed more efficiently .",
    "more efficiently here means that a larger fraction of the baryonic matter available in the dark halo actually made it into the disk - bulge system . at @xmath21",
    "this fraction is approximately forty percent , and this increases to hundred percent at @xmath125 .",
    "halos of a given mass are denser at higher redshift , and higher density implies higher escape velocity and higher cooling efficiency , both of which could give a plausible explanation for an increase of the galaxy formation efficiency with increasing redshift .    in what follows",
    "we consider two extreme cases of this galaxy formation ( in)efficiency . in the first scenario , which we call the ` cooling'-scenario , we assume that only the inner fraction @xmath34 of the baryonic mass is able to cool and form the disk - bulge system : the outer parts of the halo , where the density is lowest , but which contain the largest fraction of the total angular momentum , never gets to cool . in the second scenario , referred to hereafter as the ` feedback'-scenario , we assume that the feedback from star formation and evolution is such that each baryon in the dark halo , independent of its specific angular momentum , has a probability of @xmath34 to ultimately end up as a constituent of the disk or bulge .",
    "the choice of either of these scenarios enters our equations in the function @xmath37 ( see the appendix ) .",
    "as is well known , disks that are self - gravitating tend to be unstable against bar formation . halos with smaller @xmath38 yield disks with smaller scale - lengths ( see equation [ [ rdlambda ] ] ) . for a given disk - to - bulge ratio ,",
    "there is thus a critical @xmath38 such that for @xmath126 the disk will be bar unstable .",
    "christodoulou , shlosman & tohline ( 1995 ) derived a stability criterion for bar formation based on the angular momentum content of the disk , rather than the energy content ( such as the well known ostriker & peebles ( 1973 ) criterion ) . for a disk - bulge - halo system",
    "this stability criterion can be written such that disks are stable against bar formation if @xmath127 with @xmath128 and @xmath129 the characteristic circular velocities of the disk and the composite disk - bulge - halo system ( equation [ [ vctot ] ] ) , respectively .",
    "this criterion is similar to the one proposed by efstathiou , lake & negroponte ( 1982 ) . as characteristic velocities we consider the circular velocities at @xmath130 , since mo et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have shown that this is the radius where typically the rotation curve of the composite system reaches a maximum . for a thin exponential disk , approximately 80 percent of the disk mass",
    "is located inside @xmath131 , and @xmath132 substituting equation ( [ vdapprox ] ) in ( [ stabalpha ] ) , and using equation ( [ rdlambda ] ) we find that disks are stable if the spin parameter of their halos obeys @xmath133 with @xmath134 this reduces to @xmath135 for stellar disks and @xmath136 for gaseous disks , using @xmath137 and @xmath138 , respectively ( see christodoulou et al .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the empirical value of @xmath139 found by efstathiou et al .",
    "( 1982 ) based on @xmath44-body experiments . throughout",
    "we take @xmath140 to take into account that disks are often made up of a mix of gas and stars .",
    "the critical value of @xmath38 given by equation ( [ stablambda ] ) depends on the galaxy formation efficiency @xmath34 , and thus on the specific cosmology and formation redshift according to equation ( [ hubconst ] ) .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath141 , and @xmath142 is different for the cooling and feedback scenarios , @xmath143 depends on the particular model we choose for the galaxy formation ( in)efficiency . in figure  1 this dependence is shown for three different cosmologies : scdm , ocdm , and @xmath123cdm .",
    "the latter is a model with a non - zero cosmological constant with @xmath24 , @xmath144 , @xmath25 and @xmath145 .",
    "results are shown for both the feedback scenario ( left panel ) and the cooling scenario ( right panel ) .",
    "figure  1 plots the logarithm of the critical spin parameter versus redshift .",
    "the dotted lines outline the probability distribution of the spin parameter ( equation [ [ spindistr ] ] ) ; the indices ( indicated in the right panel only ) denote the probability of finding a halo below that line . at low formation redshifts @xmath143 increases with redshift , due to the increasing galaxy formation efficiency with redshift . the turnovers to a flat line at higher redshift are caused by the requirement that @xmath146 .",
    "note that in a scdm cosmology with @xmath147 ( for which @xmath148 ) about 50 percent of all halos yield unstable disks , and thus require the formation of a bulge component in order to stabilize the disk .",
    "this increases to @xmath149 percent in models with @xmath150 .",
    "furthermore , it is apparent that @xmath143 is much less redshift dependent in the case of the cooling scenario , than in the case of the feedback scenario .",
    "the implications of this are discussed in section  4 . as can be seen , the results are very similar for the two low @xmath151 models . since @xmath143 is the important parameter for what follows , we only focus on a comparison of scdm with ocdm cosmologies , and note that results for the @xmath123cdm model are similar as for the ocdm model .",

    "scorza & van den bosch ( 1998 ) investigated the continuity of disk properties of a variety of disk galaxies and extended the diagram towards much higher @xmath155 and smaller @xmath97 by including the nuclear disks discovered from hubble space telescope photometry in a number of early - type galaxies ( van den bosch et al .  1994 ; kormendy et al .  1996 ; van den bosch , jaffe & van der marel 1997 ) .",

    "figure  2 combines the parameters of disks that span 4 orders of magnitude in both scale - length and central surface brightness !",
    "although there is considerable ` scatter ' , the @xmath156@xmath97 diagram of figure  2 seems to reveal an almost linear relation .",
    "it is tempting to believe that this may teach us something about the formation of galactic disks .",
    "however , it should be noted that selection effects play an important role at the lower left part of the diagram : most of the spirals and s0s in figure  2 are taken from large diameter limited surveys , and are thus strongly biased towards the largest scale - lengths .",
    "furthermore , one is always strongly biased against low surface brightness disks , especially if they are embedded in a much brighter spheroid .",
    "even more , the fact that selection effects are different for the various data sets combined in figure  2 prohibits a statistical conclusion on this lower left part of the diagram ( e.g. , see detailed discussions in de jong 1996b and dalcanton et al .",
    "however , the absence of disks in the upper right part of the diagram is real , and should in principle be related to the formation and evolution of disk systems .",
    "we now use our disk - bulge - halo models to investigate the locations of the different sorts of disks in the @xmath156@xmath97 diagram .",
    "first we note that spirals and s0s with the highest central surface brightness for given scale - length lie approximately along a line of constant disk luminosity .",
    "part of the upper boundary in the @xmath156@xmath97 diagram thus seems related to a cut - off in disk luminosity .",
    "this is to be expected from the cut - off in the galaxy luminosity function , which is well described by the schechter ( 1976 ) function .",
    "this tells us that there are only very few galaxies with luminosities exceeding @xmath157 .",
    "we thus assume that the upper boundary is a line along which the sum of bulge and disk luminosities is equal to @xmath157 .",
    "the dotted line in figure  2 ( which is partly drawn as a solid thick line ) corresponds to @xmath158 .",
    "the position of a disk along a line of constant @xmath159 is determined by the spin parameter @xmath38 : disks originating from halos with smaller @xmath38 have smaller scale - lengths , and higher central surface brightness . as shown in section  2.4",

    "disks in region iii , however , require a bulge to be stable .",
    "region iv , finally , is the region where systems with @xmath167 have an unstable disk despite the presence of the bulge .",
    "the position of the big solid dot , and therewith of the boundary between regions ii and iii , depends strongly on the formation redshift and cosmology ( cf .",
    "figure  1 ) .",
    "figure  2 is based on a scdm cosmology with zero formation redshift .",
    "although quite a number of assumptions have gone into our disk - bulge - halo models , the upper boundary ( indicated by the thick solid line ) nicely separates the region without disks , from the region most densely occupied by disks .",
    "of course , the fact that the number density is highest just below the boundary is an observational bias effect as discussed above .",
    "one has to keep in mind that the @xmath155@xmath97 diagram can be rather confusing since there are _ three _ parameters that determine the position of a disk in this diagram , namely the disk luminosity , the spin parameter , and the disk - to - bulge ratio . in the following we therefore focus on another diagram in which the luminosity dependence has been removed .",
    "we now ask ourselves whether we can learn something about the formation of disks and bulges from a comparison of our disk - bulge - halo models with real galaxies .",
    "we do this by calculating , for each galaxy in our combined sample , the spin parameter @xmath38 of the dark halo which , under a given set of assumptions , yields the observed disk properties ( scale - length and central surface brightness ) .",
    "we thus use our formation scenario to link the _ disk _ parameters to those of the dark halo , and use the statistical properties of dark halos to discriminate between different cosmogonies .",
    "we start by choosing a cosmology and a formation redshift and we read in the disk - to - bulge ratio , @xmath94 , and the scale - length and central surface brightness of the disk . from this",
    "we determine the luminosities of the disk and bulge , which , upon using equations ( [ dismass ] ) , ( [ bulmass ] ) , and ( [ diskefb ] ) , yield the total mass @xmath6 and the particular density distribution of the disk - bulge - halo system .",
    "we then calculate @xmath38 from equation ( [ rdlambda ] ) and plot this against the disk - to - bulge ratio @xmath94 .",
    "this @xmath38 is the value of the spin parameter that the halo would have had if the observed disk - bulge system formed out of that halo in the way envisioned here .",
    "one of the advantages of this diagram is that the dependence on luminosity is eliminated : the position of a disk in this diagram is virtually independent of the disk s total luminosity .    in figures  3",
    "( scdm ) and  4 ( ocdm ) we plot the location of disks of lsb spirals ( triangles ) , hsb spirals ( open circles ) , s0s ( stars ) , and disky ellipticals ( solid circles ) in a @xmath168 $ ] vs. @xmath169 $ ] diagram .",
    "the five small - dashed lines in figures  3 and  4 correspond to the value of @xmath38 below which we expect @xmath170 , @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 , and @xmath174 percent of the halos for a distribution function of spin parameters given by equation ( [ spindistr ] ) with @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( see also figure  1 ) .",
    "these lines are drawn to guide the eye .",
    "if our assumptions for the formation of disk - bulge - halo systems are correct , the distribution of inferred halo spin parameters should be similar to this log normal distribution .",
    "the thick solid lines in figures  3 and  4 correspond to @xmath160 ( equation [ [ stablambda ] ] ) .",
    "disks that lie below this line are unstable against bar formation .",
    "this critical value of the spin parameter has been calculated for a halo with a total mass of @xmath175 , but is virtually identical for other halo masses .",
    "the crowding of disks at @xmath176 is due to the fact that we have assigned a disk - to - bulge ratio of ten to systems for which no value of @xmath94 was determined ( these are mainly a number of the lsb spirals ) .",
    "the panels on the left correspond to @xmath177 , the panels in the middle to @xmath178 , and the panels on the right to @xmath179 .",
    "the upper three panels correspond to models in which @xmath180 , i.e. , in which _ all _ the baryons in the dark halo make it into the galaxy",
    ". the panels in the middle correspond to the cooling scenario , and the lower panels to the feedback scenario .",
    "the main difference between the upper and the middle and lower panels is that the former have @xmath181 independent of formation redshift ( there is a non - zero but negligible dependence on @xmath16 left due to the fact that the concentration parameter @xmath17 of the nfw halo profiles depends on formation redshift ) , whereas @xmath143 increases with @xmath16 in the middle and lower panels ( according to the curves in figure  1 ) .    since @xmath182 ( equation [ [ rdlambda ] ] ) and @xmath183",
    ", disks forming in a halo with mass @xmath6 and spin parameter @xmath38 are smaller for higher @xmath16 .",
    "a higher formation redshift thus implies a larger spin parameter in order to yield the observed value of @xmath97 , something which is evident from figures  3 and  4 .",
    "furthermore , disks seem to follow the @xmath160 curve , i.e. , disk - bulge systems do not have bulges that are significantly more massive than required by disk - stability .",
    "this is at least consistent with the inside - out bulge formation scenario proposed in section  2.1 , in which the formation of disk and bulge is self - regulating and governed by disk stability .    the ocdm model with constant and near to unity galaxy formation efficiency ( upper panels in figure  4 ) can be ruled out . in this scenario systems with a large disk - to - bulge ratio , such as spirals ,",
    "are rare ; only @xmath184 percent of the dark halos is expected to yield such systems . the stability line @xmath162 crosses the average @xmath185 of the spin parameter distribution at @xmath186 , and thus half of the halos",
    "is expected to form systems with a disk - to - bulge ratio less than unity .",
    "this is in conflict with the fact that the major fraction of field galaxies are spirals .",
    "furthermore , stable spirals can only form at high redshift ( @xmath187 ) , since for lower formation redshifts the spirals fall below the stability line . in the ocdm cooling scenario , spirals that formed recently tend to be slightly more stable , but still , the probability that a certain halo yields a system with a large disk - to - bulge ratio is rather small , rendering this scenario improbable . however , for the feedback ocdm cosmogony , a promising scenario unfolds : proto - galaxies that collapse at high redshifts are preferentially found in overdense regions such as clusters .",
    "the densities of these virialized halos are high , and this ( somehow ) causes the galaxy formation to be very efficient ; nearly all the baryons in the dark halos make it into the galaxy . as a consequence , the systems that form require relatively small disk - to - bulge ratios ( e.g. , similar to s0s ) in order to be stable . as the universe evolves , and proto - galaxies with smaller over - densities ( which are predominantly located in the field ) start to turn around and collapse , the galaxy formation efficiency decreases , and systems with larger disk - to - bulge ratios are allowed to form .",
    "this scenario thus automatically yields a morphology - density relation , in which systems with smaller disk - to - bulge ratios ( e.g. , s0s ) are preferentially to be found in overdense regions .",
    "unfortunately , the disky ellipticals seem to not fit in this scenario . even at formation redshifts of three , the average disky",
    "elliptical lies near the line with @xmath188 .",
    "the scenario outlined above for our ocdm cosmology also applies to the scdm model with @xmath189 , albeit somewhat less restricting .",
    "after all , @xmath143 only gets as large as @xmath190 .",
    "consequently , in a scdm universe our model predicts less of a morphology - density relation than in a low density universe ; i.e. , the magnitude of the morphology - density relation depends on the baryon fraction @xmath28 .",
    "we define the typical formation redshift of a subset of galaxies as that redshift for which the average disk yields @xmath191 . in figure  5",
    "we plot histograms of inferred formation redshifts for spirals ( hsb and lsb disks combined ) , s0s , and disky ellipticals .",
    "the three dotted lines are drawn to guide the eye and correspond to redshifts of 1 , 3 , and 10 .",
    "the inferred formation redshift is determined by calculating the redshift at which a halo with @xmath192 yields the observed disk parameters .",
    "if a disk lies already above the @xmath193 line at @xmath194 , a formation redshift of zero is assigned .",
    "the arrows in figure  5 indicate the mean of the inferred formation redshifts for each sample . as can be seen ,",
    "spiral disks are consistent with having formed fairly recently : @xmath195 with a mean formation redshift of zero .",
    "this conclusion was already reached by mo et al .",
    "( 1998 ) based on the same disk formation scenario as used here , but on somewhat different arguments .",
    "the distribution of @xmath16 is much more spread out for s0s , with a mean formation redshift of @xmath196 .",
    "note that misclassifications may be partially responsible for this large spread .",
    "finally , the inferred formation redshifts for the disky ellipticals are unrealistically high , with a mean of @xmath197 . we thus conclude that unless there is a significant loss in specific angular momentum of the material that forms these systems , disky ellipticals seem to _ not _ form a continuous sequence with s0s and spirals , at least not in the sense of the formation scenario investigated here .",
    "the histograms in figure  5 correspond to the feedback scdm cosmogony .",
    "however , the results are very similar for the other cosmogonies discussed in this paper : although the details of the histograms are somewhat different , the averages are the same within the errorbars .",
    "as discussed above it seems unlikely that disky ellipticals can be fit in the simple bulge - disk formation scenario envisioned here .",
    "the small disk - to - bulge ratios in these systems renders an inside - out formation scenario for the bulges in disky ellipticals unlikely .",
    "two alternative formation scenarios for disky ellipticals have been proposed : ( i ) disky ellipticals are the outcome of gas - rich mergers ( e.g. , bender , burstein & faber 1992 ; scorza & bender 1996 ) , and ( ii ) embedded disks are formed out of internal mass loss from the old stars in the spheroid ( scorza 1993 ; brighenti & mathews 1997 ) .",
    "hernquist & barnes ( 1991 ) have shown how in gas - rich mergers the gas becomes segregated in two components .",
    "the first component looses most of its specific angular momentum and collapses to form a dense central cloud .",
    "when converted into stars , these compact blobs of gas may well account for the high central densities in disky ellipticals ( barnes 1998 ) .",
    "the second component gets propelled to larger radii in the tidal tails originating from the merger .",
    "this gas may either escape or reaccrete ( through cooling ) onto the newly formed ` elliptical ' and form a new disk component , resembling the embedded disks .",
    "the numerous physical processes at play and the large parameter space available make it difficult to come up with detailed predictions for the resulting merger remnant .",
    "however , at present there seem to be no clear observations that rule out gas - rich mergers as the origin for disky ellipticals ( but see kissler - patig , forbes & minniti 1998 )",
    ".    in the internal mass loss scenario one expects a clear correlation between the mass of the disk and the mass of the spheroid .",
    "this correlation is indeed present and scorza & bender ( 1998 ) showed that typical mass loss rates for the old spheroid population are in excellent agreement with the typical ratio between the masses of the embedded disk and the spheroid .",
    "another prediction from this scenario is that the spheroid and disk rotate in the same direction and that their specific angular momenta are similar ( at least if we assume that the gas blown into the interstellar medium by the spheroid does not loose its specific angular momentum when cooling to form the embedded disk ) .",
    "scorza & bender ( 1995 ) found this to be the case from kinematic decompositions of line - of - sight velocity profiles of a number of disky ellipticals from which they determined estimates of the specific angular momenta of the embedded disk and the spheroid .",
    "their data , which we plot in figure  6 , yields an average ratio of @xmath198 a third prediction associated with this scenario is that the disks are younger than the spheroids .",
    "recently , de jong & davies ( 1997 ) reported that disky ellipticals have higher h@xmath199 line indices than the more luminous boxy ellipticals , and suggested this to be due to a young population , most likely the embedded disk ( see also brighenti & mathews 1997 ) . a final prediction for the internal mass loss scenario",
    "is that the disks have surface brightness profiles that are steeper than exponential , since the gas does not cool from a uniform sphere in solid body rotation , but from a differentially rotating , centrally concentrated gas distribution ( scorza 1993 ; brighenti & mathews 1997 ) . indeed , scorza & bender ( 1995 ) and scorza et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have found that the embedded disks often have surface brightness profiles that are significantly steeper than exponential .",
    "the masses , specific angular momenta , surface brightness profiles , and ages of embedded disks are thus all consistent with them having formed out of mass loss from the old stellar population of the spheroid",
    ". more accurate determinations of the specific angular momenta of embedded disks and their spheroids in a larger sample of disky ellipticals will proof helpful in constraining this further .",
    "understanding galaxy formation is intimately linked with understanding the origin of the hubble sequence .",
    "an important clue is provided by comprehending the formation of disky ellipticals and s0s , simply because these systems form the transitional class from the classical ellipticals to the spirals .",
    "disky ellipticals seem to form a continuous sequence with spirals and s0s towards smaller disk - to - bulge ratio , and it is thus tempting to believe that disky ellipticals , s0s and spirals all formed in a similar fashion . the aim of this paper has been to investigate a simple formation scenario for disk - bulge - halo systems , and to search for the main parameters and/or processes that determine the disk - to - bulge ratio and thus explain to a large extent the origin of ( the major part of ) the hubble sequence .",
    "we considered the disk formation scenario originally proposed by fall & efstathiou ( 1980 ) , in which the size of the disk , which is formed by cooling of the gas in a dark halo , is determined by the amount of angular momentum of the halo .",
    "we have extended upon this formation scenario by including a simple picture for the inside - out formation of an additional bulge component out of the inner , low angular momentum material .",
    "stability arguments are used to suggest that the formation of the bulge is a self - regulating process in which the bulge grows until it is massive enough to allow the remaining gas to form a stable disk component .",
    "we do not describe the bulge formation in any detail but merely use empirical relations which allow us to describe the bulge by a single parameter , namely its mass .",
    "each dark halo contains a fraction @xmath28 of baryons .",
    "we introduced a galaxy formation efficiency @xmath34 which describes the fraction of those baryons that actually build up the disk - bulge system .",
    "the theory of spherical collapse coupled with the definition of a virialized halo predicts a tully - fisher relation of the form @xmath200 as observed , with a zero - point that depends on the hubble constant @xmath107 .",
    "recent observations , however , suggest that the tully - fisher zero - point is independent of redshift , implying that the galaxy formation efficiency is proportional to @xmath107 . a physical explanation for this redshift dependence may be the higher escape velocities and cooling efficiencies at higher redshifts .",
    "for a combined sample of @xmath201 galaxies , varying from spirals to disky ellipticals , we calculated the value of the halo s spin parameter which yields the observed disk properties under the assumption that disk - bulge systems form in the way envisioned here .",
    "we compared two cosmologies ( scdm vs. ocdm ) and investigated the differences between assuming a galaxy formation efficiency of unity and two ( extreme ) scenarios in which @xmath113 : a cooling scenario , in which we assume that only the inner fraction @xmath34 of the available baryons cools to form the disk and bulge , and a feedback scenario , in which each baryon , independent of its specific angular momentum , has a probability @xmath34 of ultimately ending up in the disk or bulge .",
    "our main conclusions are the following :    * disk - bulge systems do not have bulges that are significantly more massive than required by stability of the disk component .",
    "this suggests a coupling between the formation of disk and bulge , and is consistent with the self - regulating , inside - out bulge formation scenario proposed here . *",
    "if we live in a low - density universe ( @xmath202 ) , the only efficient way to make spiral galaxies is by assuring that only a relatively small fraction of the available baryons makes it into the galaxy , and furthermore that the angular momentum distribution of those baryons is similar to that of the entire system ; i.e. , the probability that a certain baryon becomes a constituent of the final galaxy has to be independent of its specific angular momentum . in the cooling scenario ,",
    "most of the angular momentum of the system remains in the outer layers , and most halos form disk - systems with massive bulges , such as s0s .",
    "if , however , the galaxy formation efficiency is regulated as described by our ` feedback ' model , a promising scenario unfolds : at formation redshifts @xmath203 the galaxy formation efficiency is unity , and systems that form build up a large bulge to support the disk that assembles around them .",
    "these galaxies resemble s0s .",
    "galaxies that form later , at @xmath204 , no longer require a massive bulge , and spirals are preferentially formed .",
    "coupled with the notion that density perturbations that collapse early are preferentially found in high density environments such as clusters , this scenario automatically predicts a morphology - density relation in which s0s are most likely to be found in clusters . in a scdm universe a similar , albeit less restrictive , mechanism is at work , which predicts a morphology - density relation of smaller amplitude .",
    "* a reasonable variation in formation redshift and halo angular momentum can yield approximately one order of magnitude variation in disk - to - bulge ratio , and our simple formation scenario can account for both spirals and s0s .",
    "however , disky ellipticals have too large bulges and too small disks to be incorporated in this scenario .",
    "apparently , their formation and/or evolution has seen some processes that caused the baryons to loose a significant amount of their angular momentum .",
    "merging and galaxy harassment ( moore et al .  1996 ) are likely to play a major role for these systems .",
    "finally we wish to emphasize of few of the major shortcomings of the oversimplified formation scenario discussed here .",
    "first of all , we have neglected the fact that the merging of halos is an ongoing process , and that this is very effective in destroying disks ( e.g. , toth & ostriker 1992 ) .",
    "gas - dynamical simulations that do not involve the energy and momentum feedback to the gas from supernova explosions , stellar winds , uv radiation etc .",
    "produce galactic disks that are some two orders of magnitude smaller than the observed spiral disks ( e.g. , navarro & steinmetz 1997 ) : merging ( and also harassment ) are very effective in transporting angular momentum out into the halo , thus yielding more and more compact galaxies .",
    "this problem with forming galactic disks of proper dimensions is often referred to as the angular momentum problem . despite our ignorance regarding the effects of merging , harassment , feedback , and ( re)-ionization of the universe , the observed sizes of ( spiral ) disks clearly suggest however , that the combine effect of all these processes is apparently such that the material that forms galactic disks has not lost much of its original angular momentum acquired from cosmological torques .",
    "the use of the fall & efstathiou disk formation scenario thus seems justified , despite the aforementioned shortcomings .    in the past semi - analytical simulations of galaxy formation",
    "have been mainly based on the assumption that all bulges result from the merging of disk galaxies ( e.g. , kauffmann , white & guiderdoni 1993 ; cole et al .",
    "1994 ; baugh , cole & frenk 1996 ; somerville & primack 1998 ) . in this paper",
    "we have examined an inside - out bulge formation scenario , which should be regarded as complimentary to this merging scenario .",
    "our formation scenario can account for both spirals and s0s , but fails to build systems that are even more bulge dominated .",
    "although it has been shown that bar - instabilities can lead to the formation of small ( and close to exponential ) bulges , a more detailed study is required to investigate whether the inside - out bulge formation scenario discussed here can yield more massive bulges as well .",
    "it is at least intriguing that the critical spin parameter is of the same order of magnitude as the typical spin parameter for halos , suggesting that a significant fraction of halos will yield unstable disks , unless part of the baryonic material is transformed into a bulge component as suggested here .",
    "so despite the clearly oversimplified nature of the formation scenario envisioned here , it may provide a useful framework for future investigations of galaxy formation .",

    "<S> these latter systems , which consist of an elliptical spheroid with an embedded disk with a scale - length of typically a few hundred parsecs , seem to form a smooth sequence with spirals and s0s towards lower disk - to - bulge ratio . the aim of this paper is to examine whether spirals , s0s , and disky elllipticals all can be incorporated in one simple galaxy formation scenario . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate an inside - out formation scenario in which subsequent layers of gas cool and form stars inside a virialized dark halo . </S>",
    "<S> the inner , low angular momentum material is assumed to form the bulge . </S>",
    "<S> stability arguments are used to suggest that this bulge formation is a self - regulating process in which the bulge grows until it is massive enough to allow the remaining gas to form a stable disk component . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the baryons that build the disk do not loose their specific angular momentum , and we search for the parameters and physical processes that determine the disk - to - bulge ratio , and therewith explain to a large extent the origin of the hubble sequence . </S>",
    "<S> the spread in halo angular momenta coupled with a spread in the formation redshifts can explain the observed spread in disk properties and disk - to - bulge ratios from spirals to s0s . </S>",
    "<S> if galaxy formation is efficient , and all available baryons are transformed into the disk - bulge system , cosmologies with @xmath0 can be excluded , since stable spiral disks would not be allowed to form . however , </S>",
    "<S> if we assume that the efficiency with which galaxies form depends on the formation redshift , as suggested by the small amount of scatter in the observed tully - fisher relation , and we assume that the probability for a certain baryon to ultimately end up in the disk or bulge is independent of its specific angular momentum , spirals are allowed to form , but only at small formation redshifts ( @xmath1 ) . at higher formation redshifts , stability arguments suggest the formation of systems with smaller disk - to - bulge ratios , such as s0s . </S>",
    "<S> since density perturbations in clusters will generally collapse earlier than those in the field , this scenario naturally predicts a density - morphology relation , the amplitude of which depends on the baryon fraction of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> disky ellipticals are too compact to be incorporated in this scenario , and they thus do not form a continuous sequence with spirals and s0s , at least not in the sense of the galaxy formation scenario envisioned in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> alternative formation scenarios for the disky ellipticals , such as gas - rich mergers or an internal mass loss origin for the embedded disks , are much more viable . </S>"
