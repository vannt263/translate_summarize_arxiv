    "is turned on in 14 ms to a depth of @xmath4 , after which the two horizontal lattice beam pairs are increased to their full depth of 40@xmath8 in 44 ms .",
    "we find that the results of the experiment ( including spatial distributions and occupancy fractions ) do not significantly change as long as the lattice turn - on times are 35 ms or longer .",
    "that remains true if we wait for tens of ms in all the traps before starting the evolution .",
    "+ _ flat lattice : _ since for technical reasons the lattice waists are much larger than the dipole trap waists , we can only create a flat lattice near the center of the trap . to fine tune",
    "the cancelation of the two potentials , we start with trapped 1d gasses with no axial lattice , and choose the highest crossed dipole beam intensity at which no atoms remain trapped in the central region .",
    "this gives a central potential that is flat to within 0.08@xmath8 over a length of 160 @xmath34 m .",
    "+ _ small bump : _ the small bump on the left of the initial atom distributions in the experimental results of fig .",
    "2 is due to spatial imperfections on the yag beams that make up the confining crossed dipole trap , where the atoms are trapped 3.4 rayleigh lengths from the beam focus .",
    "after @xmath7=0 the atoms evolve in a much smoother potential , so only the initial distribution is affected by this issue , not the evolution .",
    "the bump can serve as a feature , since it provides confirmatory evidence of the fraction of singlons that remain confined ( see , e.g. , the long time curves in fig . 2**f * * ) .",
    "+ _ determination of the trapped singlon fraction : _ we analyze the singlon distributions ( see figures 2**d**2**f * * ) , by first determining the fwhm of the doublons ( see figures 2**g**2**i * * and figure 4**b * * ) at each time .",
    "we then measure the difference between the peak of the singlon distribution and its value at the doublon fwhm positions .",
    "we assume that the confined peak height is twice that difference , and has the doublon width .",
    "we do not use this procedure at very early times , before there is a discernible shoulder in the singlon distribution , although the curves in figure 4**a * * change little if we add a few earlier points .",
    "the assumption that the fwhms of doublons and trapped singlons are the same is not exactly true for a bundle of tubes .",
    "this procedure also assumes that the unconfined singlon distribution is approximately flat in the central region , which is also not quite true .",
    "our confidence in the reliability of this procedure is buttressed by the universality of the curves in figure 4**a * * , which holds despite the systematic differences in the doublon fwhms at different @xmath4 ( see figure 4**b * * ) .",
    "* theoretical calculations * + for the theoretical analysis of the expansion , we model a collection of independent 1d tubes . in order to account for possible higher band effects during the dynamics , which may be important for the lowest lattice depths , we do not use the one - band approximation that results in the standard bose - hubbard model .",
    "instead , we discretize the space along the tubes by introducing an artificial grid of spacing @xmath35 ( we take @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the wavelength of the optical lattice ) to obtain a representation of the continuum in terms of an artificial one - dimensional bose - hubbard model.@xcite the particles are then subject to the periodic potential generated by the optical lattice and to the confining potentials generated by the crossed optical dipole trap . we simulate arrays of up to @xmath38 tubes , with each tube s length being @xmath39 .",
    "we choose the theory initial conditions so that the fraction of singlons in the simulation matches the experiment .",
    "this is done by arbitrarily tuning the strength of the @xmath40 axial and transverse trapping potentials , keeping their ratio fixed to the experimental value .",
    "the parameters for @xmath41 are those in the experimental setup , except that the overall confining potential is set exactly to zero .",
    "the calculations are carried out within the gutzwiller mean - field approximation,@xcite where the initial state is selected to be the ground state in the absence of tunneling between the 1d tubes .",

    "<S> it has been hypothesized that collisions of vacancies with triplons can thermalize the vacancies , possibly transferring them into transmissible quasimomentum states.@xcite in contrast , fermionic vacancies have the same tunneling energy as singlons in the empty lattice , so they always pass through the edge of the doublon sea .    </S>",

    "<S> in contrast , we start our experiments with trapped , superfluid , 1d bose gases in lattices with an average of between one and two atoms per site , and we quench by suddenly removing the trap . this is a fundamentally different quench , a geometric quench , after which the many - body wavefunction is still locally in equilibrium . </S>",

    "<S> we observe the subsequent spatial evolution in three ways ( referred to as m1 , m2 , and m3 ) , which together allow us to separately determine the spatial evolution of the probability distributions of singlons , doublons , and atoms at more highly occupied sites . in m1 , we measure all the atoms after a given @xmath7 by switching to a 27@xmath8 deep 1d axial lattice ( where the recoil energy @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the rb mass ) and allowing the atoms to expand radially so that the density is low enough for absorption imaging . </S>",

    "<S> although conservation of energy dictates that isolated doublons can not dissociate for @xmath25,@xcite in a predominantly doublon sea the aforementioned tunneling enhancement doubles this limit . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , one can show that a sea of singlons increases the limit by 50@xmath15 . that our doublons live in a bath intermediate to these two seas explains why they dissociate , at least for @xmath26 , and why the dissociation rate decreases at long times ( see especially fig .  </S>",

    "<S> dissociation for @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) naively requires that energy be shared among more singlons,@xcite but it might be that the one - band hubbard model calculation@xcite overestimates the effective value of @xmath11 . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig:3 ] ]    quantum distillation is difficult to isolate at early times , since it occurs while initially unconfined singlons are also leaving the central region and singlons are being created by dissolution . </S>",
    "<S> but quantum distillation dominates at 5@xmath8 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2]*f * ) after 20 ms , by which time the doublon number is stable ( see also figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2]*i * and [ fig:3]*c * ) and the unconfined singlons present a locally flat background . the number of singlons confined in the doublon sea as a function of time is plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4]*a * ( see methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> its steady decrease is a clear signature of quantum distillation , further supported by the fact that the rate scales with @xmath0 ( see also supplementary information ) . at late times , the fraction of confined singlons levels off at @xmath29 , showing long term vacancy confinement in the doublon sea . </S>",
    "<S> the mean - field calculations also show some singlons initially leaving and others remaining indefinitely ( see fig .  [ fig:3]*d * ) , but fewer singlons distill out in the calculations . </S>",
    "<S> this is expected because the real 1d gas has a broader initial quasimomentum distribution . </S>",
    "<S> thus in the calculation there are more singlons with the lower energies that do not transmit out of the doublon sea .    in @xmath0-rescaled time , after doublons stop dissolving at 5@xmath8 they are still dissolving at lower lattice depths . that the three sets of data points in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4]*a * overlap means that extra doublon dissolution does not affect the central singlon number . </S>",
    "<S> this could be because the vast majority of singlons created when doublons dissolve have the right quasimomentum for immediate quantum distillation , and leave the center rapidly .    </S>",
    "<S> further evidence of quantum distillation is given in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4]*b * , which shows the evolution of the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the doublon distribution . </S>",
    "<S> there are three size changing processes , each dominating for a time . </S>",
    "<S> the fwhms increase during the first 10 to 20 ms because doublons initially can expand into singly occupied sites and perhaps there is more doublon dissolution in the middle ( see figures  [ fig:2]*g*[fig:2]*i * ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fwhms then decrease due to the mechanics of distillation , where escaping singlons move the last doublon one site inward . when the rate of quantum distillation decreases ( near 4 ms@xmath30@xmath8 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4]*a * ) then as long as the lattice depth is small    = 3@xmath8 , 4@xmath8 and 5@xmath8 respectively in the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the squares are the theory results for @xmath4=4@xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> see methods for a description of how the data is derived from the singlon distributions . </S>",
    "<S> * b*. the fwhm of the doublon distributions vs. tunneling - rescaled evolution time . </S>",
    "<S> ( same labels as in * a * ) . </S>",
    "<S> the error bars in this figure derive from the standard deviation of 8 measurements . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4 ] ]    enough , shrinking is overtaken by expansion . </S>",
    "<S> we suspect this to be the result of higher order processes involving confined singlons that compromise the stability of the edges of the doublon sea.@xcite this unanticipated higher order effect , undoubtedly absent in fermions and not present in the mean field theory results , further limits the effectiveness of bosonic quantum distillation in producing low entropy blocks of doublons . </S>",
    "<S> the approximate stability or slight increase in the width of the doublon distribution implies that as time evolves , the number of empty sites among the doublons increases .    </S>",
    "<S> our work has concentrated on spatial distributions , which are local properties , but it should also be possible to use related techniques like time - of - flight measurements to study non - local properties , like quasimomentum distributions and correlations . </S>",
    "<S> this simple lattice system , in which the doublon sea is open but nonetheless settles to a stable steady state , can help address major open questions in quantum dynamics such as how systems thermalize in the presence of particle losses.@xcite studying how quantum correlations grow after the quench should give more general insight into how entanglement spreads in quantum systems.@xcite the fact that our mean - field treatment ( only exact in infinite dimensions ) qualitatively captures the 1d dynamics , suggest that similar dynamics occur in higher dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> finally , an experimental implementation with fermions holds the promise of producing superlatively low entropy doublon cores,@xcite which might allow the study of hitherto inaccessible models of quantum magnetism @xcite and high temperature superconductivity.@xcite </S>"
