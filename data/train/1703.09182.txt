    "manipulating atomic and molecular dynamics with external electromagnetic fields @xcite , e.g. , by using strong femto- or attosecond pulses @xcite , requires full control of the generated quantum phases .",
    "however , traditional spectroscopy methods usually do not provide access to the phase information : for instance , for nonautoionizing bound states , absorption spectra typically consist of lorentzian lines , with spectral intensities quantifying the atomic populations .",

    "absorption lines originate from the interference between a probe pulse transmitting through the medium and the field emitted by the system @xcite .",
    "the dipole response of the system and , consequently , the resulting absorption spectrum can be modified by applying an intense pump pulse , preceding or following the probe pulse at variable time delays @xcite . thereby , symmetric lorentzian absorption lines are converted into fano - like lines , with time - delay - dependent features quantifying the population and phase modification induced by the interaction with the strong pump pulse .    when interpreting spectral line - shape changes in terms of the underlying atomic dynamics , the action of the weak probe pulse is usually assumed as a small , well understood perturbation .",
    "the attention is thus focused on the characterization of the action of the pump pulse as a function of its parameters such as , e.g. , intensity and laser frequency , and the main line - shape modifications are exclusively attributed to its nonlinear interaction with the system .",

    ", we fully account for the effect of a potentially intense probe pulse , investigating how the population and phase changes induced by both pulses are encoded in its absorption spectrum . on the one hand , this allows us to fully interpret transient - absorption spectra in terms of the pump and probe parameters of interest , without _ a priori _ assumptions , which may not correspond to the conditions featured in an experiment and , hence , could lead to an inappropriate or incomplete reconstruction of the strong - field dynamics of the system . on the other hand , by considering cases in which pump and probe pulses exhibit the same intensities , we can highlight the essential differences between spectra where the probe , i.e. , measured , pulse either precedes or follows the pump pulse .",
