    "<S> deformation twinning in pure aluminum has been considered to be a unique property of nanostructured aluminum . </S>",
    "<S> a lingering mystery is whether deformation twinning occurs in coarse - grained or single - crystal aluminum , at scales beyond nanotwins . here , we present the first experimental demonstration of macro deformation twins in single - crystal aluminum formed under ultrahigh strain - rate ( @xmath010@xmath1 s@xmath2 ) , large shear strain ( 200@xmath3 ) via dynamic equal channel angular pressing . </S>",
    "<S> deformation twinning is rooted in the rate dependences of dislocation motion and twinning , which are coupled , complementary processes during severe plastic deformation under ultrahigh strain rates .    </S>",
    "<S> when we talk about crystal deformation , what do we actually talk about ? crystal defects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> crystal defects such as dislocations ( line defects ) and twins ( planar defects ) play a critical role in plastic deformation and ultimately govern the multifarious mechanical behaviors of many crystalline materials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while both dislocation slip and deformation twinning are dependent on an intrinsic material property  stacking fault energy @xcite ( sfe ) , their sensitivities to sfe differ considerably . </S>",
    "<S> a notable example is pure aluminum , a typical face - centered cubic ( fcc ) metal with high sfe ( 104142 mjm@xmath4 ) @xcite , in which deformation twinning rarely occurs even deformed at low temperatures and/or at high strain rates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this rareness of deformation twinning in such materials is normally attributed to the following two reasons : ( i ) a large number of slip systems in fcc metals render dislocation slip a very efficient deformation mode @xcite , and ( ii ) the nucleation of twinning partial dislocations require much higher shear stresses than trailing partial dislocations due to the high unstable twin fault energy @xcite . searching for macro deformation twins in pure aluminum and revealing the underlying mechanisms have been of sustained interest in the past decade .    </S>",
    "<S> molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations first predicted that nanoscale deformation twins can nucleate under high tensile stress ( 2.5 gpa ) and high strain rate ( 10@xmath5 s@xmath2 ) in nanograined aluminum @xcite , and subsequent experiments confirmed this prediction in nanograined aluminum films under different kinds of severe plastic deformation ( spd ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one explanation was proposed based on classical dislocation theory @xcite : when grain size decreases to tens of nanometers , normal dislocation activities are greatly suppressed by the high fraction of grain boundaries ( gbs ) ; as a result , deformation twinning takes over as the dominant deformation mechanism @xcite . besides nanograin size effect , many simulation and experimental studies suggest that deformation twinning prefers to occur at high strain rates in fcc metals @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . this rate - dependent twinning mechanism has been corrobarated by a very recent experiment on pure aluminum with comparatively large nanograins ( 50 - 100 nm ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , there has been no solid evidence for deformation twinning in single - crystal or coarse - grained pure aluminum . </S>",
    "<S> it is natural to ask whether deformation twinning indeed occurs in coarse - grained and single - crystal aluminum , and if it does , whether the mechanisms are the same as those in nanostructured aluminum . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , is deformation twinning just unique to nanostructured aluminum ?    in the present work , </S>",
    "<S> we develop a novel dynamic equal channel angular pressing ( d - ecap ) technique , schematically illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1a ( supplementary materials fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s1 ) , to enable large shear plastic deformation at an ultrahigh strain rate to investigate twinning in single - crystal aluminum . in traditional ecap method , </S>",
    "<S> the piston is pressed at a low speed ( 10@xmath6 ms@xmath2 ) , while in d - ecap process , a much higher piston velocity ( 10@xmath7 ms@xmath2 ) is applied to induce ultrahigh strain rates ( 10@xmath1 s@xmath2 ) .            a single - crystal aluminum rod ( ed[010 ] , td[@xmath801 ] , nd[101 ] , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1a , c ) with a purity of 99.999% , 3 mm in diameter , is set in the d - ecap die , and then extruded for only one pass by high velocity pressing at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated maximum strain rate from finite elemental analysis is about 1.4@xmath910@xmath1 s@xmath2 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s2 ) and the corresponding plastic strain is about 200@xmath3 ( fig .  1b ) . after extrusion via d - ecap , the specimen is characterized with electron back - scattering diffraction ( ebsd ) . </S>",
    "<S> high - density macro deformation twins are observed near the upper extrusion surface ( fig .  1c , s3 , s4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> such macro deformation twins had never been found previously in pure aluminum , either in nanocrystalline , ultrafine , coarse - grained , or single - crystal aluminum .    </S>",
    "<S> an example of ebsd analysis of the recovered specimen after d - ecap is shown in an inverse pole figure or ipf map ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the average twin width is about 40 @xmath10 m and the maximum length is about 500 @xmath10 m . </S>",
    "<S> the twin boundaries are determined to be typical @xmath113\\{111}60@xmath12 coherent twin boundaries ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure  1c also shows that all the macro deformation twins nucleate from the upper surface where shear deformation is augmented by the sample  die friction , and propagate toward sample interior along the shear direction ( [ @xmath821 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , unlike normal straight twin boundaries , the deformation twin boundaries induced by d - ecap process are curved , indicating twin boundary rotation . </S>",
    "<S> this is caused by strong interactions between twins and dislocations under severe shear plastic deformation . </S>",
    "<S> a large fractions of low angle grain boundaries ( lagbs ) , which correspond to high - density dislocation structures , are found in the vicinity of twin boundaries ( figs .  </S>",
    "<S> s5 , s6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> occasionally , secondary deformation twins form at preceding twin boundaries ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1c ) . </S>",
    "<S> these primary and secondary deformation twins are identified from pole figure maps , and the twin planes are \\{111 } ( figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 1d , 1e ) . </S>",
    "<S> grain boundary orientation analysis reveals that the average misorientations are approximately 60@xmath12 , and the slight deviations from this angle are caused by twin boundary rotation ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1f ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the deformation twins in single - crystal aluminum processed with d - ecap are `` macroscopic '' in nature , distinct from nanotwins observed previously in nanograined aluminum @xcite . in nanograined aluminum , as grain size decreases to below a critical value ( @xmath015 nm ) , the critical stress for dislocation nucleation becomes higher than that for deformation twinning , and therefore , deformation twinning replaces dislocation slip as the preferred deformation mode @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , nanoscale grain boundaries can also strongly restrict twin propagation , thus limiting twin size to several nanometers . </S>",
    "<S> our experiments demonstrate that deformation twins can be induced by simultaneous ultrahigh strain rates ( via dynamic loading ) and large shear deformation ( via ecap ) , and grow to sub - mm scales in single - crystal aluminum without grain boundaries serving as the barrier to twin propagation . </S>",
    "<S> md simulations suggest that spontaneous self - pinning of dislocations impedes the motion of dislocations at high strain rates , and thus deformation twinning takes over as the predominant deformation mode . </S>",
    "<S> our experimental results confirm this prediction @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  2a shows abundant deformation twins with a typical lens shape formed within the sample interior , which has undergone less friction and smaller shear strain . during severe plastic deformation , high - density dislocation structures ( lagbs ) </S>",
    "<S> are found to cluster around twin boundaries , suggesting that deformation twins can serve as dislocation sources as well as barriers , effectively hindering dislocation motion around them ( figs .  2b , 2c ) . </S>",
    "<S> to further verify this observation , twin and grain boundary fractions are quantified from the ipf map . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2d , lagbs , or high - density dislocation structures , are the most prominent microstructure feature . during such ultrahigh strain - rate shear deformation , </S>",
    "<S> dislocation nucleation and interactions are still significant near and within deformation twin boundaries , and the propagation of deformation twins assists dislocation nucleation as new dislocation sources ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our experiments provide direct evidence that dislocation slip and deformation twinning can act together as complementary deformation modes during ultrahigh strain - rate shear deformation . </S>",
    "<S> this is contrary to previous md simulations and experiments claiming that the transition from dislocation slip to twinning can occur in aluminum only when dislocation activities are strongly suppressed .    in order to help reveal phenomena and underlying mechanisms related to deformation twinning under ultrahigh strain - rate shear deformation within the context of d - ecap experiments , </S>",
    "<S> md simulations are carried out . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation details are presented in supplementary materials . in our md simulations mimicking the d - ecap experiments , the pressing velocity is relatively low ( 10 ms@xmath2 ) , but the corresponding strain rate is still high ( @xmath010@xmath13 s@xmath2 ) given the relatively small length scales . </S>",
    "<S> when the sample initially passes through the die corner , the leading partial dislocations first emit from this area ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resolved shear stress is about 1 gpa ( 1.05@xmath3 , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s8 ) , comparable to twin nucleation stress reported previously , 0.64 gpa @xcite and 0.93 gpa @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the twin partial dislocations immediately appear following the leading partial dislocations , and then a nanotwin forms . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3b and 3c show that , as deformation twins propagate , dislocations nucleate from the twin boundaries , and this greatly enhances the local deformation ability in order to accommodate the high deformation rate . on the other hand , dislocations quickly become self - pinned and tangled ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s9 ) as they move away from twin planes . </S>",
    "<S> high - density dislocation structures ( i.e. , lagbs ) arise near the twin boundaries , consistent with our experimental results . </S>",
    "<S> when the propagation of deformation twins ceases , dislocation motion and dislocation interactions begin to dominate plastic deformation , and annihilation of certain twins occurs as a result ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3d ) .            </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that deformation twins propagate faster at high loading rate in a number of materials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our d - ecap experiments and md simulations demonstrate the coexistence of deformation twinning and dislocation slip in single - crystal aluminum . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is desirable to compare the propagation speeds of dislocation motion and deformation twinning during high - rate shear deformation . figure  4 shows that the leading partial dislocations nucleate first , and the speed of dislocation motion increases with increasing shear strain but remains subsonic . </S>",
    "<S> subsequent transition to deformation twinning leads to a velocity burst , and deformation twins propagate at a transonic speed . </S>",
    "<S> classical dislocation theory predicts that , dislocation velocity can not exceed the shear wave velocity @xcite , and with increasing dislocation velocity , dislocation self - pinning and tangling ensue , leading to stress accumulation until deformation twins nucleate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> twin propagation velocity exceeds the shear wave velocity . </S>",
    "<S> the enormous propagation velocity jump ( subsonic to transonic ) is a direct result of the dislocation - twinning transition in single - crystal aluminum necessitated by the ultra - high strain rate .    </S>",
    "<S> the d - ecap experiments and md simulations reveal that deformation twinning and dislocation slip coexist in single - crystal aluminum under ultrahigh strain - rate loading . </S>",
    "<S> the applied strain rate , @xmath14 , consists of contributions from dislocation motion and deformation twinning : @xmath15 based on classical dislocation theory @xcite , @xmath16 = @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a material - specific parameter , @xmath19 is the burgers vector amplitude , @xmath20 is the mobile dislocation density , and @xmath21 is the average dislocation propagation velocity . </S>",
    "<S> twin boundaries can serve as new dislocation sources while propagating , and subsequently , the mobile dislocation density increases rapidly due to fast twin propagation </S>",
    "<S> . then eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) can be rewritten as : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the initial mobile dislocation density , @xmath24 is dislocation nucleation rate , @xmath25 is the propagation velocity of a deformation twin , and @xmath26 is the average width of twins ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s10 , supplementary materials ) .    if deformation involves dislocation motion only , then @xmath27 , and is limited by @xmath21 which is subsonic . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> dislocation itself can not accommodate the applied strain rate for sufficiently high @xmath14 , and the strain deficit has to be supplemented by faster propagating deformation twinning ( transonic twinning , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> dislocation self - pinning and tangling slow down dislocation motion , and give rise to intense stress accumulation and subsequently deformation twinning . </S>",
    "<S> new dislocations nucleate at propagating twin boundaries ( as new dislocation sources ) @xcite , and mobile dislocation density increases by @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , dislocation frustration leads to deformation twinning , which in turn assists dislocation nucleation . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , dislocation slip and deformation twinning coexist and complement each other necessarily in high - rate plastic deformation of aluminum , as seen in our experiments and md simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> our d - ecap experiments and md simulations have demonstrated that deformation twinning is not unique to nanostructured aluminum , and macro deformation twinning can occur in single - crystal , and likely coarse - grained , aluminum under ultrahigh strain rates . </S>",
    "<S> deformation twinning and dislocation slip are rate - controlled , coupled , and complementary processes during ultrahigh strain - rate plastic deformation . </S>",
    "<S> deformation twinning , once elusive in experiments , may indeed play a major role in plastic deformation under high strain rates for aluminum , and conceivably , other high - sfe metals . </S>"
