    "among the techniques currently used to discover extrasolar planets , microlensing has some unique capabilities ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "apart from the fact that microlensing probes for planets around stars over a large volume of the galaxy , among both the bulge and the disk population , and can also discover free - floating planets ( @xcite ) , it is sensitive to planets at projected host separations that are distinct from those probed by other methods , namely about 1 to 10 au .",
    "this corresponds to the area beyond the snowline  where gas and ice giants are likely to form .",
    "microlensing is thus complementary to other methods , such as radial velocity or transit surveys , which are most sensitive to planets in close orbits around their host stars , and to direct imaging of planets , which probes larger separations ( e.g. @xcite ) . to date , however , only about a dozen planets have been discovered via microlensing ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , out of the total @xmath3550 known planets , and the @xmath31200 candidates recently announced by the kepler mission ( @xcite ) .",
    "the paucity of microlensing - discovered planets is a consequence of the surveying strategy , largely followed to date , which has focused on high - magnification lensing events .",
    "as summarized in @xcite , all currently known microlensing - discovered planets were first discovered by one or both of two wide - field , low - cadence microlensing surveys , ogle ( @xcite ) and moa ( @xcite ) .",
    "events whose initial light curves suggested high peak magnifications triggered global networks of telescopes for photometric ( and sometimes spectroscopic ) follow - up of these specific events . indeed , among the 12 known microlensing planets ( 11 systems , as ogle-06 - 109l has two planets ) eight were discovered in events with amplifications greater than 100 , and three had medium magnifications ( greater than 10 ) .",
    "all of these events had long event time scales ( 40 - 60 days ) , whereas the typical event time scale is @xmath320 days ( see section [ sec : sim_samp ] , below ) , and high cadences were therefore not essential .",
    "only one event , ogle-05 - 169l ( @xcite ) , was a low - magnification event , with an amplification of 3.0 and a relatively short event time scale of 11 days . the source , however , was a bright star with a baseline magnitude of @xmath4 , which permitted triggering of the follow - up network nonetheless .",
    "all of the above events had peak @xmath5-band magnitudes brighter than 16.7 .",
    "given the limited observational capabilities to date , the high - magnification follow - up strategy has been the optimal choice .",
    "bright events can be followed up with high cadence using small telescopes , and these events are fortuitously also those with the highest sensitivity to planets .",
    "however , only 1% of all microlensing events have magnifications @xmath6 .",
    "since the surveys of the galactic bulge have discovered roughly 700 events per year in recent years , and apparently only a fraction of all stars host planets near their snowlines , only a couple of planets per year have been discovered , resulting in the current microlensing planet tally .",
    "microlensing survey statistics have been used in the past to constrain the frequency and properties of snowline - region planets by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite derived the mass - ratio distributions of cold exoplanets , and found that neptune - mass planets are three times more common than jupiters beyond the snowline .",
    "@xcite find from the high - magnification events that the frequency of solar - like systems around lens stars is about 1/6 .",
    "however , two main problems complicate these estimates .",
    "one is the small - number statistics they are based on .",
    "the other is the complex social process that determines which events are followed up , and how , a process which then needs to be modeled in order to estimate the intrinsic planet properties .",
    "@xcite argue that the very chaotic nature of the process results , in the end , in a randomization that minimizes selection effects and gives a high level of completeness .",
    "nevertheless , a more controlled microlensing experiment would provide confidence that this is indeed the case .",
    "it has been clear for some time that , to make progress and overcome these problems , a second generation  ( hereafter generation - ii ) microlensing survey ( e.g. , @xcite ) must be initiated , one in which a large fraction of all ongoing microlensing events toward the galactic bulge  both low and high magnification  are monitored continuously with a cadence that is high enough to detect planetary perturbations in the light curves .",
    "although only a fraction of low - magnification events will reveal planets , even if they are present around the lens star , the numbers of such events are much larger than high - magnification events . in the balance , such a survey , over several years , could yield a sample of planets that is competitive with those from other techniques .",
    "the requirements are straightforward  a network of 1m - class telescopes situated so as to allow 24-hour coverage of the bulge , equipped with degree - scale imagers . in june - july 2010",
    ", we carried out a 6-week pilot version of such a generation - ii experiment .",
    "starting april 2011 , we have begun a full generation - ii experiment . in this paper",
    ", we perform numerical simulations of the possible outcomes of this and similar experiments .",
    "we begin our study by considering a variety of physical possibilities for the abundance of planetary systems and their properties . we then ray trace through the systems to generate a library of microlensing light curves with the correct distribution of observed properties , such as peak magnification , peak magnitude , and timescale .",
    "the simulated light curves are then observed  using the real observational parameters of our ongoing experiment , including sampling , weather gaps and photometric noise .",
    "finally , the data are processed through a realistic detection pipeline , to recover the detection efficiency and the expected number of detections for each combination of physical and observational parameters .",
    "the results we present here can therefore serve to predict the power of an experiment to distinguish among models , and to optimize the experiment s yield .",
    "we note that , although generation - ii experiments will discover many well - characterized planetary events , our focus is on the mere detection of planetary anomalies , even when they may end up not being unambiguously modeled .",
    "our methodology builds upon , and extends previous studies of the planet detection efficiencies of microlensing surveys ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . however , to our knowledge",
    ", ours is the first study to combine the following important elements in such a simulation : we consider full 8-planet solar - analog systems ; we investigate the effect of the snowline radius of those systems , for a range of scaling dependences on mass ; for our simulated light curve generation , we use the observed distributions of lensing event timescales , impact parameters , and peak magnitudes , and the distributions of lens mass , distance , and velocity implied by galactic models ; we use the real sampling patterns and photometric error distributions ( including outliers ) of the ongoing generation - ii experiment that we simulate .",
    "eventually , we will use the tools we develop here to constrain the actual physical parameter space of exoplanets probed by microlensing .    in section [ sec : gen_2_net ] , we present the observational setup of our generation - ii network . in section [ sec : sim_samp ]",
    ", we describe the simulations , starting with the light curve generation process , and up to the detection procedure . in section [ sec : results ] we discuss the results we obtain as a function of the various input parameters .",
    "a summary of our results is given in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the generation - ii microlensing experiment is , in essence , a continuous - monitoring , high - cadence survey with a field of view of 8 @xmath7 centred on the galactic bulge .",
    "the experiment network currently includes four telescopes :    1 .   the 1m - telescope at wise observatory in israel with the laiwo camera , with a 1 @xmath7 field of view ( @xcite ) .",
    "the cadence for each of the eight wise fields is @xmath330 minutes . 2 .",
    "the las campanas observatory 1.3 m warsaw university telescope in chile with the ogle - iv camera , with a 1.4 @xmath7 field of view ( @xcite ) .",
    "the ogle - iv phase has three extremely high - cadence fields observed every @xmath315 minutes and five high - cadence fields observed once per @xmath345 minutes .",
    "the 1.8 m moa - ii telescope in new zealand with the moa - cam3 camera , with a 2.2 @xmath7 field of view ( @xcite ) .",
    "the moa - ii phase has six extremely high - cadence fields ( every @xmath315 minutes ) and six high - cadence fields ( every @xmath345 minutes ) ; most of these latter fields are outside the full network footprint .",
    "4 .   the palomar observatory 1.2 m oschin telescope in california with the ptf camera , with a 7.8 @xmath7 field of view ( @xcite ) and a cadence of @xmath340 minutes .",
    "this telescope participates only during one month every year , when the network has the highest continuous coverage .",
    "furthermore , the ptf footprint overlaps with only 4 @xmath7 of the wise fields .",
    "the network parameters are summarized in table [ table : network ] .",
    "figure [ fig : fields ] shows the region of the galactic bulge covered by the network .",
    "the 8 @xmath7 covered by wise , ogle , and moa include the fields with the highest microlensing event rates in previous ogle and moa seasons .",
    ".the generation - ii network [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for the optimal observing plan of 150 days with 15-minute minimum cadence , we find that 83% of the detections are due to deviations produced by a single planet , 16% are due to two planets ( i.e. , two planets contribute to the detected anomalies in an event ) and fewer than 1% of the detections are caused by three of the planets in the system .",
    "thus , if solar analogs are common , one out of every 4 or 5 planetary detections could turn out to be a double - planet detection , as in ogle-06 - 109l ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in terms of the identity of the planets causing the anomalies , for a scaling index @xmath8 , over 65% of the planets are jupiters , 24% are saturns , 4% uranus , 4% neptunes , and 1% earths .",
    "the fraction of detected jupiters  rises for lower snowline scaling indices , reaching 84% for @xmath2 .",
    "figure [ fig : planets ] ( left panel ) shows the projected locations of the jovian planets in units of the einstein radius , @xmath9 , as a function of the snowline scaling index .",
    "microlensing is most sensitive to planets in the so  called lensing zone , @xmath10 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig : planets ] shows the number of detections of jupiters , saturns and neptunes as a function of the snowline scaling index . as seen in this figure ,",
    "the lensing dominance of jupiters among the detections is a consequence of the fact that , under our scaled solar - analog assumption , this planet ( the most massive one ) is never far from the einstein radius .",
    "nevertheless , medium - mass planets , such as neptune , can also be detected with high cadence surveys , whenever they are projected near the lensing zone .",
    "in this work , we have studied various aspects of generation - ii microlensing experiments  the optimization of the observational parameters of such experiments , and their sensitivity to planets for different physical assumptions about the planetary systems .",
    "our main results are the following :    1 .   long duration experiments with continuous high cadence are vital .",
    "experiments with low cadences of 3 hours will detect only about half as many planets as experiments with cadences of 15 minutes , and likewise experiments lasting one - half , versus a full , bulge season .",
    "the current approach of using a network of 1-m - class telescopes for a generation - ii experiment is adequate for tracking the low - magnification events discovered by these same telescopes .",
    "we have quantified , for our particular network and its parameters , the decrease of the planet detection efficiency with the decrease of the peak brightness of an event .",
    "the abundance of planetary systems is degenerate with the snowline scaling index .",
    "conversely , with constraints on planetary fraction from other planet - hunting techniques , microlensing surveys could discriminate among different planet formation scenarios that predict different snowline scalings .",
    "4 .   the majority of events with anomalies will be due to single planet deviations ( 83% ) , assuming solar system distance and mass ratios , but the non - negligible remainder can reveal two planets .",
    "5 .   for solar - like systems",
    ", at least 65% of the detections will be of jupiters , due to both the mass and the location near the einstein radius of this planet .",
    "the current generation - ii experiment which continuously monitors 8 @xmath7 of the galactic bulge with the highest microlensing event rate , and with a cadence of 15 - 30 minutes , will be able to determine , after four full seasons , the abundance of planets near the snowline to a precision of 10 - 30% .",
    "this , assuming the fraction of galactic stars hosting such planets is between 1/3 to 1/10 , and a snowline scaling power - law index in the range 0.5 to 2 . 7 .",
    "the main contaminant to planet detection , binaries , can largely be filtered out already at the detection stage , based on the longer deviation timescales that they produce .",
    "additional characterization and modeling of individual events in the timescale overlap region between planets and binaries will further lower the contamination fraction .",
    "a full generation - ii experiment , of the type we have simulated here , is already in progress , our results show that first estimates of the frequency and nature of snowline - region planets will be possible soon . to improve the analysis",
    ", our future simulations will include also higher - order dynamical effects ( parallax , orbital motion , xallarap ) , a distributions of source sizes , limb darkening , and a wider range of physical planetary system possibilities .",
    "together with results from other planet - search techniques , a clearer picture should emerge of the properties of planetary systems and the physics of their formation .",
    "we thank s. dong , a. gould , a. horesh , and e. ofek for practical advice on lensing calculations , and a. udalski for providing the ogle - iv temporal sampling patterns .",
    "we thank ogle , moa , and ptf for their collaboration in the generation - ii effort ."
