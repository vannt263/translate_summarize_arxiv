    "the study of scattering and bound states of nonrelativistic particles in the schrdinger equation framework is a well known and understood problem @xcite .",
    "the scattering of low momentum particles by one - dimensional potentials that are well behaved at infinity has zero transmission coefficient at zero energy , and the reflection coefficient is unity unless the potential supports a half bound state ( zero energy resonance ) . in that case",
    "there is no reflection and the transmission coefficient is unity provided that the potential is symmetric .",
    "the pioneering works on the computation of transmission and reflection coefficients in one - dimensional potentials go back to bohm @xcite who coined the definition of transmission resonance to scattering states with transmission coefficient equal to unity and vanishing reflection .",
    "recently @xcite , these results have been generalized to asymmetric potentials .",
    "the generalization of the concept of transition resonances to relativistic quantum mechanics presents some subtleties related to the dirac equation @xcite . for a free dirac particle",
    "there are positive energy states @xmath0 as well as negative energy states @xmath1 . in the presence of an external potential ,",
    "half bound states occur for @xmath2 and @xmath3 , in contrast to the non - relativistic case where these only exist at @xmath4 in the dirac equation framework one should talk about zero momentum resonances rather than zero energy resonances .",
    "the study of scattering and bound states in the presence of strong electromagnetic fields in relativistic quantum mechanics is also a rather old problem .",
    "soon after the formulation of the dirac equation @xcite , klein @xcite found that for very high potential barriers an unusually large number of electrons penetrate into the wall .",
    "moreover , those electrons have negative energy .",
    "sauter @xcite found the same results in the more general case where the barrier smoothly grows .",
    "pair creation for the klein paradox is stimulated by the incoming electron beam .",
    "when the depth of a square well exceeds @xmath5 , the energy of the lowest bound state becomes equal to @xmath6 , and the bound level joins the states of the dirac sea .",
    "the bound states dive into the energy continuum @xcite .",
    "the klein paradox in a one - dimensional saxon - woods potential was studied by dosch _",
    "et al _ @xcite , showing that in this case transmission resonances exist .",
    "kennedy @xcite discussed supercriticality in this potential , demonstrating that , as in the square potential case , the one - dimensional woods - saxon potential has transmission resonances of zero momentum when it supports a half bound state at @xmath2 .",
    "the saxon - woods potential presents the particularity of being a smoothed form of a square well ; the dirac equation presents half bound states with the same asymptotic behavior as those obtained with a potential barrier @xcite .    in the present article",

    "a noticeable difference between the woods - saxon potential and ( [ a1 ] ) is that this one does not exhibit a square barrier limit .",

    "we solve the 1 + 1 dirac equation explicitly and compute the bound energy states for @xmath17 for @xmath18 and show that this potential supports supercritical states which correspond to transmission resonances for the potential ( [ a1 ] ) , for @xmath19    the article is structured as follows . in sec .",
