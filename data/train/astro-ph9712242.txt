    "the visible , infrared and radio afterglows of grb970228 and grb970508 have taught us many things .",
    "some of them are obvious : the absorption redshift @xmath0 of grb970508 established the cosmological distance scale of grb beyond any reasonable doubt , confirming the very strong case made on statistical grounds@xcite from batse data .",
    "it is also evident that afterglows are very faint .",
    "this suggests that the simultaneous visible counterparts to grb , as yet unobserved , will also be faint , so that experiments designed to detect them will have to be very sensitive . the loss of the original hete , carrying an insensitive ultraviolet imager , may therefore have been fortunate , for it will be replaced by hete-2 which instead will carry a soft x - ray ccd which may yield important spectral information .",
    "observations of afterglows can answer a number of harder questions too :    1 .",
    "what is the relative importance of internal _ vs. _ external shocks ? 2 .   where does a grb end and its afterglow begin ? 3",
    "does gamma - ray activity last as long as the afterglow , and could it be an inseparable part of the afterglow ?",
    "these questions are central to the understanding and interpretation of afterglows .",
    "external shocks have been widely considered for grb since they were suggested by rees and mszros@xcite .",
    "they predict a hard - to - soft evolution of the spectrum . in many models",
    "the duration or elapsed time @xmath1 is related to a characteristic emission frequency @xmath2 by a power law @xmath3 ; the exponent @xmath4 is model dependent@xcite but is usually close to @xmath5 .",
    "this is in remarkably good agreement with x - ray and soft gamma - ray observations@xcite of the single - peaked grb960720 in which @xmath6 .",
    "however , the fact that grb with a wide range of durations ( from tenths to hundreds of seconds ) have comparable @xmath2 argues against external shock models , which generally predict that these two quantities should vary roughly reciprocally ; it is difficult for @xmath2 to be in the soft gamma - ray range if the duration is minutes .",
    "there must be more to grb than external shocks .",
    "fenimore , _ et al._@xcite and sari and piran@xcite showed that an external shock can produce only smoothly varying time - dependent emission , not the spiky multi - peaked structure found in many ( but not all ) grb . such complex variation must reflect variation in the supply of energy ; it can not be explained solely by interaction with a heterogeneous medium , however complex .",
    "a variable outflow may radiate when different fluid elements interact with each other .",
    "this process is generally called an internal shock because it does not involve an external medium , although there need be no shock in the hydrodynamic sense of a discontinuity in pressure , density and temperature between two fluids each in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "kinematic constraints require that there be inelastic interaction between streams of matter emitted with widely differing lorentz factors in order that radiation be produced with reasonable efficiency .",
    "afterglows have , so far , been observed to have a smooth single - peaked time dependence in visible light ( their complex time dependence at radio frequencies results from interstellar scintillation@xcite ) , and therefore are naturally explained as a consequence of external shocks .",
    "this model predicted@xcite both the existence of afterglows and the gradual rise to maximum which was observed in both grb970228@xcite and grb970508@xcite . however , there is no evidence that internal shocks could not produce the required time dependence , and they are therefore possible explanations for smooth single - peaked grb and for afterglows , as well as for the multi - peaked grb for which they are required .",
    "is it meaningful to distinguish an afterglow from the grb itself ?",
    "this question first arises for x - rays , whose photon energy range overlaps that traditionally assigned to grb .",
    "it has no good answer , and should be considered a matter of nomenclature rather than of physics .",
    "rather , we should be concerned with deciding which emission is produced by internal shocks and which by external ; the taxonomist may wish to label the former the grb and the latter the afterglow .",
    "there are two possible limits@xcite . in one",
    "all the radiation is the product of an external shock .",
    "this is excluded , at least for multi - peaked grb .",
    "it may describe single - peaked grb and their afterglows .",
    "external shock models successfully predicted@xcite the delayed maximum of visible afterglow brightness observed in grb970228@xcite and grb970508@xcite , and are likely to explain such afterglow emission even if they can not explain gamma - ray emission .",
    "these models also successfully predicted@xcite self - absorption in the radio afterglow , as was observed@xcite from grb970508 .    in the other limit all the emission of a grb",
    "is the product of internal shocks , which may continue for days@xcite beyond the nominal gamma - ray duration ; the afterglow is a continuation , at lower intensity , of the gamma - ray emitting phase .",
    "this has been suggested for grb970228 , where it agrees with the observed instantaneous spectrum@xcite , and the predicted continuing x - ray emission ( beyond the decaying afterglow ) has been observed from grb970508@xcite .",
    "this hypothesis is consistent with the hours - long gamma - ray emission of grb940217@xcite , and may explain the `` gang of four '' bursts of october 2729 , 1996@xcite as a single grb .",
    "early work on grb and their afterglows attempted to construct analytic and numerical models of the entire process . unfortunately , several essential quantities are poorly known ( and unlikely to be the same for all grb or uniform within a single grb ) , such as the distribution of energy among the electrons , ions and magnetic field , the surrounding density and magnetic field , the efficiency of radiation and the degree of collimation . as is so often the case , the real world has turned out to be more complex than theorists could imagine , and a more phenomenological approach is required .",
    "theories of radiation mechanisms generally predict instantaneous spectra , but observations of afterglows are rarely simultaneous across the spectrum ; x - ray , visible and radio observers face different observational constraints .",
    "it is possible to fit multiparameter models@xcite to non - simultaneous data , but the phenomenologist would like a more direct comparison of the emission in different frequency bands .",
    "for example , in each band of interest the peak spectral intensity can be measured , or at least estimated , if measurements are obtained close to and straddling the maximum .",
    "the resulting function @xmath7 is not an instantaneous spectrum , but makes it possible to compare emission mechanisms in different spectral bands .    in the case of grb970508 @xmath7",
    "can be estimated at ghz , visible ( and near - ir ) , hard x - ray and soft gamma - ray energies ( the maximum of the soft x - ray intensity was not observed ) , and is shown in figure [ jikfig1 ] .",
    "a single mechanism is unlikely to explain emission in all these bands , because @xmath7 is not consistent with a single power law , as would be predicted by a single mechanism which does not have a characteristic frequency to define a spectral break .",
    "the visible data form a `` hinge '' ; on purely phenomenological grounds it is not possible to say whether this emission is produced by the same mechanism as the ghz emission or the hard x - rays and soft gamma - rays .",
    "neither of the limiting cases discussed in the previous section is satisfactory .",
    "a plausible hypothesis suggests that ghz and visible emission result from external shocks and hard x - rays and soft gamma - rays ( the classical grb ) from internal shocks .",
    "this explains why an early model@xcite underestimated the time to maximum and overestimated the brightness of the visible afterglow of grb970508 : it extrapolated from the gamma - ray emission of an assumed bright grb , but this extrapolation was invalid ( even if scaled to the lesser flux of grb970508 ) because the gamma - rays were produced by a different mechanism .",
    "it is also possible to compare@xcite the properties of different grb and their afterglows by comparing the burst - to - burst ratios of @xmath7 in different spectral bands .",
    "the afterglow of grb970508 was roughly 20 times brighter than that of grb970228 in soft x - rays and visible light , when scaled to their soft gamma - ray brightnesses .",
    "the afterglow of grb970508 was at least four times brighter than that of grb970111 at 1.43 ghz , and at least 1000 times brighter than that of grb970828 in visible light when similarly scaled ( in these last two cases the ratios are lower limits because only upper limits exist to the fluxes of grb970111 and grb970828 in these bands ) .",
    "these ratios quantify the conclusion that grb970508 had a remarkably bright afterglow , compared to the the other grb for which useful data exist , at all frequencies at which comparisons are possible .",
    "this leads to the important ( and unexpected ) conclusion that afterglows are `` all different '' . they are not all scaled versions of the same event , and any single simple model must fail .",
    "it argues against models in which all grb and afterglows are related by a single scaling parameter , such as the ambient density , energy or distance , or even some combination of these .",
    "a natural interpretation is that ( at least in these grb ) the hard x - rays and gamma - rays are produced by internal shocks , and the lower frequency afterglow by an external shock .",
    "if so , there need be no close correlation between the brightnesses of grb and their afterglows , partly because the mechanisms are different , but also because internal shock properties depend on the detailed temporal and spatial structure of the outflow and may well be very different in different grb .",
    "a generic afterglow model is based on the assumption of an external shock , which permits specific predictions to be made .",
    "the interaction between a relativistic debris shell and the surrounding medium , or among various elements of an outflowing wind , has been the subject of many papers , but the basic physics is not understood .",
    "even the essential collisionless shock is largely a matter of speculation , although recent calculations@xcite have begun to attack the problem .",
    "still , a few features common to most afterglow models are independent of assumptions as to the mechanism of entropy production .",
    "the asymptotic ( @xmath8 ) instantaneous spectrum@xcite has the form @xmath9 between a self - absorption frequency @xmath10 and a characteristic synchrotron frequency @xmath2 .",
    "below @xmath10 the spectrum @xmath11 , while above @xmath2 the flux falls off with a slope reflecting the high energy `` tail '' to the particle distribution function ; a power law is typically observed in grb , but its slope is unpredictable , and is observed to differ from burst to burst and with time in a given burst .",
    "the instantaneous spectra @xmath12 are bounded from above by the function @xmath7 . in simple analytic models @xmath13 , with the exponent @xmath14",
    "typically@xcite close to 0 ; any function of @xmath15 other than a power law would define a characteristic break frequency and require a more complex model .    as time progresses both @xmath10 and @xmath2 decrease . at a given frequency",
    "@xmath16 the flux @xmath17 rises until @xmath2 declines to @xmath18 , after which @xmath17 decreases .",
    "this predicted behavior has been observed , at least qualitatively , in the afterglows of grb970228@xcite and grb970508@xcite .",
    "the predicted rate of the initial rise @xmath19 , where the preceding expressions for @xmath7 and @xmath20 and the instantaneous @xmath21 lead to @xmath22 typically , @xmath23 is estimated to be slightly less than unity ; in one model@xcite @xmath24 4/5 while in another@xcite @xmath24 6/7 .",
    "figure [ jikfig2 ] shows the evolution of the instantaneous spectrum .",
    "@xmath17 rises until @xmath25 and then declines .",
    "the predictions of the generic external shock afterglow model can be tested with data from the two observed afterglows .",
    "the predicted rise to maximum has been observed .",
    "some data@xcite suggested agreement ( @xmath26 ) with the predicted rate of rise for grb970508 , but more complete data for grb970228@xcite and grb970508@xcite suggest a much steeper rise , with @xmath273 .",
    "these large values of @xmath23 appear to disagree with the model .",
    "sari@xcite pointed out that in the early stages of external shock models , when the relativistic debris shell has not yet been significantly slowed by the ambient medium , the luminosity should rise @xmath28 at all frequencies ( @xmath29 ) , a simple consequence of the increasing ( @xmath30 ) area of the shell .",
    "if this is the explanation then the rapid rise should level out after a time @xmath31 when deceleration becomes important ( the earlier stages of the rising flux could be hidden under steady emission by other processes , such as internal shocks ) .",
    "this leads to an estimate of the ambient density @xmath32 : @xmath33 if the model is correct this implies an extraordinarily low ambient density out to a radius @xmath34pc , or a surprisingly low value of @xmath35 .",
    "such a low density would be remarkable , even in the intergalactic medium ( although a pre - coalescence pulsar wind could create a bubble ) , and such a low @xmath36 is inconsistent with gamma - gamma pair production constraints ( although in a long duration internal shock model a low @xmath36 wind could follow a brief high @xmath36 wind which produces the gamma - ray emission ) .",
    "if the afterglow is produced by internal shocks it is probably not possible to predict its time dependence .",
    "however , the instantaneous spectrum is still predictable .",
    "there is some spectral evidence that the first several hours of afterglow in grb970228 were the product of internal shocks@xcite .",
    "internal shocks are a possible explanation of disagreements between the observed time dependence and predictions of the generic external shock model .    this early ( 38 hours after the grb ) period of roughly constant visible intensity in grb970508 poses another problem . in either internal or external shock models ,",
    "if the electron synchrotron cooling time is short compared to the duration of observation then the observed spectrum is that integrated over the electrons cooling history@xcite : @xmath37 .",
    "comparison of the visible and soft x - ray@xcite fluxes during this period shows a deficiency of x - rays compared even to this spectrum , suggesting that @xmath2 lies within or below the x - ray band .",
    "this is consistent with emission by an internal shock with a low value of @xmath36 , as suggested by both the near constant visible intensity and the long - delayed onset of the rapid rise .",
    "these conclusions are based on limited data from two afterglows .",
    "the outline of the external shock afterglow model is supported by the data , but the detailed interpretation , especially of the rise of the visible intensity to maximum , must await more data from more afterglows .",
    "the predicted@xcite instantaneous asymptotic spectrum @xmath38 for @xmath39 should be applicable to both internal and external shocks . it is based on several plausible assumptions : incoherent synchrotron radiation , no cooling ( radiative or adiabatic ) and a phase space argument for the electron distribution function produced by a relativistic shock which heats the entire electron distribution function , rather than just a `` tail '' of suprathermal particles .",
    "it should apply to the synchro - compton spectrum too , but with a different coefficient .    like all theoretical predictions , it is only speculation until empirically tested .",
    "so far , the data are inconclusive and not completely consistent . some x - ray and soft gamma - ray observations of grb support the prediction@xcite , but others disagree@xcite .",
    "the inconsistency may result from the difficulty of extracting quantitative spectral information from nai scintillator data , which have low intrinsic spectral resolution , especially at photon energies @xmath40 kev where the asymptotic spectrum is expected .",
    "this difficulty may also account for the long - standing controversy over the reality of line features in grb radiation , and may only be resolved when data from detectors of intrinsically higher resolution become available .    visible data@xcite lead to an exponent @xmath41 in the pre - maximum phase of the afterglow of grb970508 , in agreement with the predicted 1/3 (",
    "agreement is not expected at and after maximum , because then the frequency of observation exceeds @xmath2 ) .",
    "radio data@xcite from the same afterglow lead to an exponent @xmath42 , also in agreement with prediction .",
    "the results are encouraging , but not yet conclusive .",
    "if a grb were to be detected in visible light during its initial brief phase of gamma - ray emission the spectral exponent could be determined quite accurately by comparing fluxes at frequencies separated by a factor of more than @xmath43 .",
    "such simultaneous detection remains the holy grail of grb visible counterpart research .",
    "self - absorption of grb afterglows at ghz frequencies was predicted@xcite and confirmed@xcite .",
    "this was no great surprise ; the physics is elementary , though a little different ( the spectral exponent below @xmath10 is predicted to be 2 rather than 2.5 ) than in the usual case of synchrotron self - absorption by a power law distribution of electron energies .",
    "self - absorption is important because it may lead to a measurement of the emission radius @xmath44 as a function of time with few uncertain assumptions .",
    "the flux for @xmath45 is @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the distance ,",
    "@xmath48 the cosmological redshift , @xmath49 the proton mass and @xmath50 an equipartition factor defined as @xmath51 ; @xmath52 in the case of complete electron - ion - magnetic equipartition .",
    "the shock lorentz factor ( assumed @xmath53 ) drops out ; this is fortunate , for it is poorly known and likely to remain so .",
    "if @xmath54 were inferred from measurements of the self - absorbed flux then it would be possible to reconstruct the expansion history and slowing down of the relativistic debris in an external shock model .",
    "this would permit determination of the ambient density and the efficiency of radiation as the initial kinetic energy is radiated or shared with swept - up matter .",
    "a preliminary attempt@xcite to construct such an energy budget ( based on one inferred value of @xmath44 ) for the afterglow of grb970508 led to the conclusion that the total kinetic energy after seven days was only @xmath55 erg , where @xmath56 is the ambient particle density .",
    "this is much less than the @xmath57 erg inferred from the gamma - ray radiation , assuming isotropic emission",
    ".    there are three possible implications of this result : @xmath58 @xmath59 , as might be found in a dense star - forming region ; strong beaming of the gamma - rays ( and therefore of the initial relativistic outflow ) ; or a radiation efficiency @xmath60% in the first seven days of the event .",
    "any or all of these are possible , and any or all would be important .",
    "we have compared the observed afterglows to theoretical predictions based on simple models , and have generally found qualitative agreement . in order to test the theory ,",
    "particularly that of relativistic shocks , in more detail , more difficult measurements will have to be performed .",
    "here is a list of ambitious goals a theorist might set for his observational colleagues :    1 .",
    "accurate x - ray spectroscopy at moderate resolution ( @xmath61 ) to test the predicted instantaneous @xmath9 ( @xmath62 if synchrotron cooling is important ) .",
    "this may be performed by zncdte or ge detectors , or by x - ray ccd .",
    "simultaneous spectral measurements across several decades of frequency , with @xmath63 throughout ( hence the intensity must not have reached its maximum anywhere in this range ) .",
    "this could be achieved by observation of the visible counterpart to a grb during its strong gamma - ray activity , or by simultaneous measurements of visible and radio afterglow before the visible maximum ( within the first day for grb970228 and grb970508 ) .",
    "3 .   measurement of the intensity as a function of time in the self - absorbed regime of radio afterglow .",
    "each of these measurements is likely to be difficult .",
    "locating and measuring a visible counterpart to a grb within tens of seconds is much harder than doing it with several hours of imaging x - ray observations .",
    "the only afterglow observed at radio frequencies was not strong enough to be detected until long after the visible maximum , and self - absorption reduces the strength of the radio emission even more .",
    "the first goal is probably the most feasible , and would test relativistic shock theory ; the last is probably the one which would lead to the greatest understanding of how grb and their afterglows really work .",
