    "understanding the process of planet formation in nascent solar systems is a long - standing goal of astrophysical theory .",
    "the traditional picture is an orderly one in which planets slowly build up their mass first by accreting rocky planetesimals , then ( if sufficiently massive ) gas from the surrounding protostellar disk .",
    "the recent multiple detections of extrasolar planets close to the central star , a configuration once thought to be highly improbable , pose a stern challenge to this relatively simple picture of planet formation . in the wake of these discoveries , contemporary theories",
    "emphasize the importance of the dynamical interaction between a developing planet and the ambient gaseous disk .",
    "a possible explanation for the presence of giant planets near their central star is that they have migrated inwards after having formed farther out in the disk .",
    "this requires angular momentum to be removed from the planet by an imbalance in the positive and negative torques exerted upon it @xcite .",
    "two mechanisms have been identified , known as type i and type ii migration .",
    "type i migration is essentially a linear process in which the planet excites trailing density waves at the lindblad resonances .",
    "the waves carry angular momentum outward through the disk .",
    "there are torques of opposite signs exerted at both the inner and outer resonances , but for a given @xmath0 ( azimuthal wavenumber ) , the outer resonance lies closer to the planet and the coupling is stronger @xcite . therefore ,",
    "if the interaction is dominated by the lindblad torques , then more angular momentum is lost than acquired by the planet , which would then drift inward . the role of corotation torques , however , is still under investigation , and needs to be understood if type i migration is to be put on a firm theoretical footing @xcite . in type ii migration ,",
    "nonlinear gravitational interactions between the disk and the planet clear a gap at the orbital radius of the planet @xcite .",
    "disk material then no longer accretes across the planet s orbital radius , and the planet is carried inward with the disk itself on an accretion time scale .",
    "the rate of migration thus depends on whether a gap forms or not , and whether there is , in fact , an turbulent stress to drive accretion in the disk .",
    "unless for some reason disk material remains abundant in the immediate vicinity of the planet , one important consequence of gap formation is likely to be that planet formation will be severely limited .",
    "traditionally , turbulence has been modeled as a stokesian viscosity in accretion disk studies , and the criteria for a planet to open a gap are not the same in viscous and inviscid models . @xcite and @xcite discuss the conditions pertinent to each class of model . in the case of an inviscid accretion disk ,",
    "the competing forces are the local fluid pressure , which resists the creation of a gap , and the planet s gravitational tidal force , which promotes gap formation .",
    "the tidal criterion for gap formation is that a gap can form if the planet s roche ( or hill ) radius @xmath1 exceeds the pressure scale height @xmath2 , which we define as the ratio of isothermal sound @xmath3 to local orbital frequency @xmath4 . for a planet of mass @xmath5 orbiting a central star of mass @xmath6 at radius @xmath7 ,",
    "the roche limit is @xmath8 .",
    "thus a gap forms if @xmath9 denoting the right hand side of equation ( [ tidal ] ) as @xmath10 , the tidal criterion is simply @xmath11 .    in viscous disk models , there is another condition that must be satisfied before a gap can open .",
    "the is set by the requirement that the rate at which planetary torques clear the gap must exceed the rate at which viscous torques replenish it .",
    "the condition is @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is defined as the ratio of the viscosity to @xmath14 .",
    "this is essentially the @xcite parameterization    these gap conditions have been extensively investigated via two - dimensional numerical simulations of @xmath13 disks @xcite .",
    "an important limitation of this approach is that the most interesting consequences of the planet - disk interaction depend upon the nature of the stress , and viscosity is not synonymous with turbulence .",
    "the origin of the anomalous disk stress and turbulent transport is no longer unapproachable . if @xmath13 represents a stress arising from internal disk turbulence , then the source of this turbulence is magnetic @xcite .",
    "as discussed by @xcite purely hydrodynamic sources of turbulence are problematic at best , and none has been observed and sustained in a fully three - dimensional simulation of a keplerian disk .",
    "the problem is illustrated by studies of convective turbulence : when this form of turbulence is imposed , it drives inward , not outward , angular momentum transport @xcite .",
    "this is no fluke of the peculiar properties of convection , it is what happens quite generally if incompressible turbulence is driven in a rotationally stable disk . if nonlinear instabilities were a possibility , they would be present in convective and shearing sheet simulations @xcite .",
    "the shearing sheet is scale - free and any instabilities would accordingly not require extremely large reynolds numbers to appear .",
    "( there is nothing special about the behavior of very small scale disturbances that would not also be seen at larger scales . )",
    "this is why @xcite easily found nonlinear planar couette flow instabilities .",
    "their absence from any numerical simulation of a keplerian disk casts doubt on their existence .",
    "trailing density waves transport angular momentum outwards of course , but their excitation and maintenance must be explained , and this is most readily done only if the disk itself is strongly self - gravitating . even in this case , the transport properties are generally nonlocal , and not well - suited to an @xmath13 formalism description @xcite . the nature of , and difficulties with , an @xmath13 disk associated with direct planetary torques",
    "have recently been discussed by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we perform numerical experiments of planets in protostellar disks in which the internal turbulence and its stress arise self - consistently from the magnetorotational instability .",
    "these simulations examine how turbulence affects the formation of gaps in the disk , and , equally importantly , how the planet affects the turbulence . in this first study",
    "we will assume ideal mhd , and not address the issue of the ionization state of the disk , or the degree of magnetically coupling in the gas .",
    "these issues are far from resolved @xcite .",
    "it is of interest to examine the `` simplest '' case first .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in  2 we describe the numerical model used for the simulations . in ",
    "3 we present several two dimensional hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "these models serve as code tests , they provide a comparison with previous numerical work , and they are the controls for the mhd simulations which follow in  4",

    "its principal function is to spread shock transitions over a few grid zones .",

    "we have run two types of simulation : inviscid hydrodynamic models in two dimensions @xmath53 , and three - dimensional turbulent mhd simulations . because neither the mri nor field amplification can operate without vertical structure , simulations of mri - induced turbulence must be three - dimensional .",

    "one such consequence is illustrated by msp , a small mass planet that fails to satisfy either the tidal or the viscous gap opening condition . in msp",
    "the density _ increases _ within the roche radius of the planet , forming an `` anti - gap . ''",
    "the maxwell stress has decreased near the planet and gas accretes into this region faster than it leaves .",
    "this density rise further decreases the local alfvn velocity of the fluid , reducing the wavelength of the fastest growing mri mode , further reducing the stress .",
    "outside of the planet s roche radius the low mass planet produces a weak spiral wave , but otherwise has a minimal effect on the evolution of the accretion disk .",
    "see f6.jpg    the top panel of figure [ pdt ] is a comparison of the radial density profiles for the three embedded planet toroidal mhd simulations , similar to the top panel of figure [ hyddentime ] .",
    "the corresponding plots for each one of the planetary masses are easy to separate by the depth of the gap produced .",
    "the low mass planet simulation produces a density increase at the planet s radius , while the other planets gaps are shallower than those seen in the hydro runs , and their outer edges were not as well - defined .",
    "note that the overall slope in the radial density profile is consistent with the presence of ongoing accretion .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ pdt ] displays the time history of the density , similar to the bottom panel of figure [ hyddentime ] .",
    "once again , the three different planetary masses can be separated by the rate at which the density decreases .",
    "the small mass planet shows a steady increase in density at the planet s orbit .",
    "in the other two cases , the rate of density decrease is much less than with hydrodynamics alone ; accretion hampers gap formation .",
    "the middle mass planet ( run mmp ) satisfies the tidal condition but not the viscous condition . exceeding",
    "the tidal condition ensures that the planet will exert a significant influence on the the accretion disk whether or not it is ultimately able to clear a gap . as is clear from figure [ mhdd ] the planet was able to produce a noticeable density reduction around its roche radius .",
    "the planet also creates a strong spiral wave in the disk .",
    "most surprisingly , after about 50 planetary orbits , the magnetic stress inside @xmath7 decreases to very low levels ( see fig .",
    "[ ps ] ) . again",
    ", not only does the stress in the disk affect the planet s ability to form a gap , but , at least in these reduced growth rate simulations , the planet can influence the turbulent stress within the disk .",
    "the large mass planet ( run mlp ) easily satisfies both gap criteria , and its effect on the disk is the most extreme .",
    "a large density gap develops rapidly , although the formation time @xmath77 is increased over the purely hydrodynamic model .",
    "a strong global spiral wave is generated , from the inner to the outer radial boundaries . and , as with run mmp , the planet modifies the disk by lowering the maxwell stress , here in both the inner and outer disk .    in these three runs the planet",
    "was placed into an already turbulent magnetized disk . in the next experiment ,",
    "we approach the problem from another direction : we add a magnetic field to a purely hydrodynamical disk in which a gap has formed .",
    "this new simulation , labeled hmmp , is initialized by adding a @xmath78 toroidal field to the disk from simulation hmp after 100 planetary orbits .",
    "the result is a disk with just the same parameters as in simulation mmp .",
    "the ordering of the appearance of turbulence and the appearance of a planet does not matter . in mmp , a shallow gap forms even though the mass ratio @xmath75 does not exceed the viscous criterion .",
    "adding a magnetic field to hmp has an immediate effect , and accretion begins to fill in the much deeper gap produced without stress .    in figure [ phmhddentime",
    "] , the top panel shows the radial density profile at the moment the magnetic field is added to the disk ( dotted line ) , and after 100 orbits of mhd evolution ( solid line ) .",
    "the bottom panel depicts the time history of the density at the planet s radius .",
    "the initial hydrodynamic phase exhibits an exponential decrease in density as the gap deepens .",
    "however , once the toroidal magnetic field is included and turbulence develops , the density at the planet s radius begins to increase , returning to about the same level that it had at the end of run mmp . at the end of the simulation",
    "the gap has become shallower , wider , and much less well - defined than in the hydrodynamic simulation .",
    "the turbulent stresses drive accretion across the gap , increasing the mass in the inner disk at the expense of the outer disk .",
    "apparently a planet that satisfies the tidal criterion , but not the viscous criterion , can form only a partial gap .",
    "we have also examined the effect of varying @xmath55 by altering the temperature of the underlying disk . to keep the average @xmath13 value comparable to the previous simulations , the initial magnetic field strength must also be adjusted .",
    "the ratio of the fastest growing wavelength to the disk radius , @xmath79 , is held constant by varying @xmath80 , since @xmath81    run mmph is a hotter disk ( @xmath82 ) with the medium mass planet .",
    "this planet does not satisfy either the tidal or viscous criterion for gap formation .",
    "in fact , an anti - gap , or over - density , is produced , just as in the msp simulation .",
    "run mspc is a cooler disk with @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and a small mass planet .",
    "it satisfies the tidal criterion , but not the viscous criterion . during the first 60 orbits of evolution",
    ", the density drops inside the planet s roche radius ; after that time the rate of decrease declines nearly to zero .",
    "the density in the gap levels off at around 8% of its original value , similar to the results of the mmp simulation .",
    "when the tidal criterion is satisfied , the density within the roche radius is reduced , but if the viscous condition is not met , the gap is not completely emptied .    initially , in run mspc there is a measurable maxwell stress throughout the disk , but once the planet is inserted , the magnetic stress in the inner disk is reduced .",
    "a comparison between this simulation and msp is instructive . when the planet was not able to produce a density gap in msp , the maxwell stress was largely unaffected . in the cooler disk ,",
    "however , the small mass planet did produce a gap , and the turbulence in the inner disk was diminished .",
    "this suggests that the threshold for gap production is closely related to the threshold for affecting the disk stress .",
    "evidently , both processes mark the onset of nonlinear disk - planet interactions .    in run mzmp ,",
    "a medium mass planet in a vertical field , the disk was evolved for 100 orbits , allowing a gap to form .",
    "in contrast to run mmp , the maxwell stress was sustained inside of the planet s orbit , but it is significantly reduced outside of the planet s orbit . of course even in run mznp which does not have a planet , it is clear that at large radii in the mhd turbulence is rather weak , so this effect can not be attributed solely to the presence of the planet .",
    "the continued presence of maxwell stresses in the inner portion of the disk , however , is a significant difference from what is seen in the toroidal field simulation .    comparing the density evolution in run hmp with mzmp",
    "we find remarkably good agreement between the two simulations . even though the turbulent stresses are initially present in the mhd simulation , the resulting density profile and time history are essentially those of the hydro simulation .",
    "the reason for this is clear . in the mhd simulation at late times ,",
    "the maxwell stress in the outer disk is drastically reduced , effectively ending inward accretion . with no fluid moving from the outer disk to the inner",
    ", nothing flows across the gap .",
    "consequently , the rate of gap formation and radial profile of the gap are the same as in the hydro simulation .      the simulations have provided evidence that not only does the stress affect the formation of a gap around the planet , but , under some circumstances , the planet can directly influence the turbulent stress . in run",
    "msp , the stress was reduced only within the planet s roche radius , while in the larger mass planet runs ( mmp and mlp ) , throughout most of the inner disk the maxwell stress was significantly reduced at late times .",
    "this occurs more rapidly with the large mass planet .",
    "the question naturally arises whether the presence of the planet directly causes the reduction of the mhd stress , or whether changes in the disk and magnetic field due to the overall evolution have altered the mri stability properties of the disk . to distinguish between these possibilities we return to the end of run mmp and",
    "remove the planet .",
    "the disk , magnetic field , and gap remain , but the spiral wave is quickly lost once the planet is gone .",
    "figure [ rmmpdenstress ] shows the before and after radial profiles of density ( top panel ) and maxwell stress ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the solid lines correspond to the point in time when the planet was removed , and the dashed lines are from 20 orbits later . the bottom panel dramatically shows how the maxwell stress in the inner disk recovers after the removal of the planet , increasing by a factor of 10 after 20 orbits .",
    "the density distribution , on the other hand , changes only slightly over this same time .",
    "the most noticeable change in the radial density profile is that the gap has become shallower and its edges less defined .",
    "this experiment suggests that interactions between the spiral density wave and the mhd turbulence affects the level of the maxwell stress .",
    "the planet s influence on the disk as a whole is clearly manifest as a large spiral wave .",
    "figure [ max2pi ] displays vertically - averaged maxwell stress images from planetless simulation and the two small - planet mhd simulations , msp and mspc . without a planet",
    ", the magnetic stress is spread evenly throughout the disk . in the msp run ,",
    "the planet is not able to form a gap .",
    "the planet produces a spiral wave that is strong only near the planet .",
    "when the disk is cooled in the mspc simulation , the small mass planet is able to form a gap .",
    "as can be seen from the bottom image , the planet now has a much more extended influence on the magnetic stress .",
    "the inference is that if the planet is massive enough to create a gap , it is massive enough to produce a spiral density wave that interacts with , and lowers , the turbulent maxwell stress in the disk interior .",
    "see f11.jpg    it should be noted that this effect may well be sensitive to the choice of a toroidal field .",
    "the maxwell stress in the crippled vertical field run mzmp was not substantially reduced by the planet , even though it did form a gap .",
    "this point requires further study .",
    "in this paper we have examined the formation of gaps by planets in protostellar disks in the presence of maxwell and reynolds stresses produced by mhd turbulence .",
    "the aims of this first study were to test the tidal and viscous conditions for gap formation , and to observe the effects of the planet on an mhd turbulent disk .",
    "we began with a series of inviscid hydrodynamic simulations as controls . under these conditions",
    "gap formation is determined by the tidal criterion : a planet will clear a gap when the local roche radius is greater than the pressure scale height .",
    "our hydrodynamic simulations agreed with this condition and with the many simulations of such disks already in the literature .    to establish a turbulent disk , we ran an initial toroidal field configuration for 40 planetary orbits prior to the insertion of the planet itself .",
    "the resulting disk had significant maxwell and reynolds stresses that vary with radius , but which gave an average @xmath13 value of 0.02 .",
    "a planet was then added , and the results compared with the tidal and with the viscous criteria for gap formation .    when the planet was insufficiently massive , or the disk too hot to satisfy the tidal condition , a gap did not form .",
    "in fact , the density around the planet increases .",
    "the mhd turbulence drives an overall accretion flow from the outer to the inner disk , and because the planet is able to reduce the turbulent stress within its roche radius , there is a local buildup in density .    in several simulations ,",
    "the planet satisfied the tidal criterion , but not the viscous criterion . in this case , the density within the roche radius is still significantly reduced , but not to zero .",
    "the resulting gaps are more shallow than those seen in the pure hydro runs , and the radial density profiles at outer edges of the gap are wider .    when a planet satisfies both the viscous and tidal criteria , a gap formed , but at a reduced rate compared with the hydrodynamic runs .",
    "accretion across the gap continues , and the edges of the gap are somewhat smeared out . the accretion rate is not large enough to prevent the density within the gap from being driven to a very low level .    in a recent paper , @xcite present a simulation of a planet placed in an mhd turbulent disk .",
    "their simulation considered a @xmath85 mass planet ( equivalent to our high mass planet ) on a cylindrical grid with a disk model that has the same radial power law dependence on @xmath18 and @xmath20 in the main part of the disk as the model as described in  2 .",
    "they use @xmath86 ( hotter than our models ) , and an initial sinusoidally - varying vertical field that produces mhd turbulence with an averaged @xmath13 value of @xmath87 compared with our models that use a stronger toroidal field with @xmath88 .",
    "nelson & papaloizou ran a single simulation with higher resolution than our models .",
    "the focused on the interaction of the planet with a disk and a pre - existing gap , whereas our aim is to consider the gap formation process itself in the presence of mhd turbulence .",
    "@xcite found , as we did , that spiral waves produced by the planet reduced the stresses provided by the mhd turbulence ; they observed this effect mainly near the gap where the waves were strong .",
    "they do not observe evidence for accretion across the gap , whereas some of our simulations show this .",
    "this suggests that whether or not there is accretion across the gap depends on such parameters as @xmath75 , @xmath13 , and @xmath55 .",
    "some results do not differ dramatically from those seen in viscous hydrodynamic studies .",
    "for example , @xcite found that the tidal condition had a greater effect on the width of the gap and the strength of the spiral waves than variations in viscosity . by determining the rate at which gas flows into the gap",
    ", the viscosity affects mainly the accretion rate onto the planet .",
    "@xcite compared their model directly with a viscous model and found a number of differences in detail .",
    "the gap in the turbulent disk model was deeper than the viscous model with equivalent @xmath13 value .",
    "clearly , matters are much more interesting than the viscous models would predict .",
    "the presence of the planet itself directly influences the turbulence levels and stress within the disk .",
    "this could not be seen with a standard @xmath13 viscosity simulation , for in such a model the viscosity can influence , but not be influenced by , the planet .",
    "we found that the small mass planet reduced the maxwell stress in its immediate vicinity , allowing matter to accumulate here .",
    "more significantly , the medium and large mass planets were able to reduce the turbulence levels in the disk region interior to their orbits .",
    "tests showed that this was not because the mri was stabilized by changes within the disk structure .",
    "rather , it appears to be due to a nonlinear interaction between the spiral wave induced by the planet and the turbulence .",
    "this wave has to exceed a certain strength to have this effect . in the main part of the disk",
    "the rule is when the planet is massive enough to open a gap it can also reduce the turbulent stress .",
    "it should be noted that this effect was observed only in the disks where the initial field was toroidal , and not in the simulation with a weak vertical field ."

    "<S> the formation of gaps in the disk can severely limit the mass of the planet and its migration toward the protostar . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the process of gap formation through magnetohydrodynamic simulations in which internal stress arises self - consistently from turbulence generated by the magnetorotational instability . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations investigate three different planetary masses and two disk temperatures to bracket the tidal ( thermal ) and viscous gap opening conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the results are in general qualitative agreement with previous simulations of gap formation , but show significant differences . in the presence of mhd turbulence , </S>",
    "<S> the gaps produced are shallower and asymmetrically wider than those produced with pure hydrodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the rate of gap formation is also slowed , with accretion occurring across the developing gap . </S>",
    "<S> viscous hydrodynamics does not adequately describe the evolution , however , because planets capable of producing gaps also may be capable of affecting the level mhd turbulence in different regions of the disk . </S>"
