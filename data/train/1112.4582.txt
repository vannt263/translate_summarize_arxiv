    "-3 mm    if all that we know about a quantum system is its dimension @xmath7 ( the number of levels ) and that it is well isolated from the environment , a reasonable model  or at least a reasonable first guess  for the state of the system is a unit vector selected at random from the sphere of an @xmath7-dimensional complex hilbert space @xmath8 .",
    "if the system interacts with some part of the environment , represented by an ancilla space @xmath9 , the quantum formalism suggests as a model the so - called ( random ) _ induced state _ , obtained after partial tracing , over @xmath9 , a random pure state on the space @xmath10 .",
    "the same description applies if we are primarily interested in a _",
    "subsystem _ of an isolated system , the setup that is addressed in the abstract .",
    "the above is just one example of how a random paradigm arises naturally in the quantum context . in the last few years",
    "probabilistic considerations have become a very fruitful approach in quantum information theory , the highlights being the fundamental paper @xcite by hayden , leung and winter and , more recently , hastings s proof that suitably chosen random channels provide a counterexample to the additivity conjecture for classical capacity of quantum channels @xcite .",
    "although random states have been considered for many years , their properties ( e.g. , _ are they typically entangled ?",
    "_ ) remained elusive . in this note",
    "we describe a reasonably general way to handle such questions .",
    "of course , the induced state @xmath11 being random , we can not expect to be able to tell what @xmath11 is .",
    "however , we may be able to infer some properties of @xmath11 if they are _ generic _ ( that is , occur with probability close to @xmath12 ) .",
    "as it turns out , for many natural properties a phenomenon of phase transition takes place ( at least when @xmath13 is sufficiently large ) : the generic behavior of @xmath11 `` flips '' to the opposite one when @xmath14 changes from being a little smaller than certain threshold dimension @xmath15 to being larger than @xmath15 .    for simplicity",
    ", we will focus on the _ random induced states _ mentioned at the beginning of the introduction .",
    "this leads ( see @xcite ) to a natural family of probability measures on @xmath16 , the set of states on @xmath8 , where @xmath17 , the dimension of the ancilla space , is a parameter . for specificity , consider @xmath18 and let us concentrate on two properties : _ entanglement _ and _ positive partial transpose _ ( ppt ) .",
    "this choice is based , first , on the importance of these concepts and , second , on the differences in their respective mathematical features , which allow to present the diverse techniques needed to handle the problems .",
    "concerning the importance aspect , we note that detecting and exploiting entanglement  originally discovered in the 1930 s @xcite  is a central problem in quantum information and quantum computation at least since shor s work @xcite on integer factoring .",
    "next , the positive partial transpose is the simplest test for entanglement ( peres  horodecki ppt criterion , see @xcite ) and is at the center of the important _ distillability conjecture _ @xcite , a positive answer to which would give a physical / operational meaning to the ppt property . on the other hand , from the computational complexity point of view ,",
    "verifying the ppt property is easy ( just check whether the partial transpose of the state @xmath11 is positive semi - definite ) , while deciding whether @xmath11 is entangled is a computationally intractable ( np - hard ) problem @xcite .    in the special case when @xmath19 equals @xmath20 , partial tracing over the ancilla space",
    "@xmath9 leads to the uniform distribution on @xmath21 ( i.e. , uniform with respect to the lebesgue measure , or hilbert  schmidt volume , denoted by @xmath22 ) .",
    "more generally , when @xmath23 , the corresponding probability measure @xmath24 has a density with respect to the lebesgue measure on @xmath21 which has a simple form @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a normalization factor .",
    "note that defines the measure @xmath24 ( in particular ) for every real @xmath23 , while the partial trace construction makes sense only for integer values of @xmath17 .",
    "if @xmath27 , the measure @xmath24 is concentrated on the boundary of @xmath21 , but still can be described analytically . another way to implement these measures is to start from the _ complex _ wishart  laguerre matrices @xmath28 ( @xmath29 , with @xmath17 degrees of freedom ) @xcite , a classical ensemble in statistics and mathematical physics , and to normalize them to have trace @xmath12 .    in spite of the explicitness of the formula , it is not easy to find  even approximately , and even for @xmath30  the probability that a random induced state has ppt or is entangled",
    "this is because these traits are not encoded in a simple way in the spectral properties of @xmath11 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite  via methods of high - dimensional probability  that the proportion of states ( measured in the sense of @xmath31 , i.e. , the legesgue measure ) that are un - entangled , or _ separable _",
    ", is extremely small in large dimensions .",
    "this was extended to the case when @xmath32 is slightly larger than @xmath33 in @xcite , while , on the other hand , it was proved in @xcite that random induced states on @xmath34 are typically separable when @xmath17 is proportional to @xmath35 .",
    "the paper @xcite also established that un - entangled states are extremely rare even among ppt states ( again , when @xmath30 ) .",
    "however , even such simple question as `` _ does the proportion of the ppt states among all states go to @xmath36 as the dimension increases ? _ , '' originally asked in @xcite , has not been rigorously addressed prior to the work that we describe in this note .",
    "the results we summarize go a long way in filling the gaps in understanding of the phenomena in question ( see @xcite for details and references ) .",
    "we show that the threshold between entanglement and separability occurs when @xmath17 is roughly of order @xmath37 , and that the threshold between npt ( i.e. , non - ppt ) and ppt is when @xmath38 .",
    "the heuristics behind the consequences stated in the abstract is now as follows .",
    "if we have a system of @xmath0 particles ( with @xmath39 levels each ) which is in a random pure state , and two subsystems of @xmath2 particles each , then the `` joint state '' of the subsystems is modeled by a random induced state on @xmath34 with @xmath40 and @xmath41 . in particular",
    ", the relation @xmath42 , or @xmath43 , corresponds exactly to @xmath44 .",
    "a similar argument applies to the ppt property .",
    "another consequence of the results is that , for a large range of parameters , when the ancilla dimension @xmath17 is roughly between @xmath45 and @xmath46 , a generic random state is both ppt and entangled .",
    "such states are _ bound entangled _ , or _",
    "undistillable _ @xcite and , in spite of being entangled , are useless for purposes such as teleportation or superdense coding ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . however , since for small systems ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 , see @xcite ) ppt is equivalent to separability , one is tempted to think that bound entangled states are an anomaly , and that the ppt property remains a good proxy for separability in higher dimensions .",
    "our results imply that this heuristic becomes misleading for large systems and that ppt and separability are quantitatively very different properties .",
    "while , as we postulated , random induced states form the most natural family of probability measures on @xmath21 , our methods are fairly robust and allow handling of other random models .",
    "for example , another popular way to construct random states is to consider mixtures of pure states .",
    "our analysis applies to this model as well : if @xmath49 is the distribution of @xmath50 , where @xmath51 are independent uniform pure states , then all the results presented for the measures @xmath24 remain valid _ mutatis mutandis _ for @xmath49 .",
    "-1 mm we recapitulate the setting : @xmath52 , @xmath53 is a ( random ) unit vector uniformly distributed on the sphere of @xmath54 , and @xmath55 is a random state on @xmath56 whose distribution is denoted by @xmath24 .",
    "further , we assume that @xmath57 and @xmath58 ; states on @xmath8 will be considered entangled , ppt etc . , with respect to this particular splitting . for definiteness , the partial transpose @xmath59 will be the transposition in the second factor , i.e. , defined ( by its action on product states ) via @xmath60 .",
    "the first result describes the phase transition between generic entanglement and generic separability .",
    "@xcite [ threshold : separability ] there exist effectively computable constants @xmath61 and a threshold function @xmath62 satisfying    -3 mm @xmath63    -2 mm such that if @xmath11 is a random state on @xmath34 distributed according to the measure @xmath64 and if @xmath65 , then    for @xmath66 we have    @xmath67 and    for @xmath68 we have    @xmath69    where @xmath70 depends only on @xmath71 .",
    "let us mention that our methods extend also to the multipartite setting and to `` unbalanced '' systems such as @xmath72 , @xmath73 ",
    "see @xcite for precise statements .",
    "the idea behind the proof of theorem [ threshold : separability ] , based on tools from high - dimensional convexity , is quite general and can be used to estimate thresholds for other properties of random induced states ( beyond separability ) , provided the set of states with given property is a convex subset @xmath74 and has some minimal invariance properties . however , in the special case of ppt we have a more precise result .",
    "@xcite [ threshold : ppt ] let @xmath11 be a random state on @xmath34 distributed according to @xmath64 . set @xmath75 and let @xmath76 . then    for @xmath77 we have    1.5 cm @xmath78 and    1.5 cm @xmath79    where @xmath70 depends only on @xmath71 .    as noted in @xcite , it is likely that the sharp estimate in ( i ) is of order @xmath80 ; this conjecture leads to interesting large deviation problems for matrices @xmath81 .",
    "the proof of theorem [ threshold : ppt ] ( except for the exponential estimates on the probabilities , which require a unified approach common to both theorems ) depends on methods of random matrix theory and , specifically , on the following result that identifies _ asymptotic spectral density _ of the partial transpose of random induced states , and which is of independent interest .",
    "if @xmath82 is a hermitian matrix , we will denote by @xmath83 and @xmath84 the largest and the smallest eigenvalues of @xmath82 . if @xmath85 and @xmath86 , the _ semicircular distribution _",
    "@xmath87 is the probability measure with support @xmath88 $ ] and density @xmath89 .",
    "we then have    @xcite [ sc : ppt ] given @xmath90 , let @xmath91 be a random mixed state on @xmath34 distributed according to @xmath92 .",
    "then , as @xmath93 tends to @xmath94 , the eigenvalue distributions of @xmath95 approaches the deterministic measure @xmath96 in the following sense : for any interval @xmath97 , the proportion of eigenvalues of @xmath95 inside the rescaled interval @xmath98 converges ( in probability ) towards @xmath99 .",
    "moreover , we also have convergence of the extreme eigenvalues @xmath100 and @xmath101 to respectively @xmath102 and @xmath103 , the endpoints of the support of @xmath96 .",
    "it is easy to numerically `` check '' the conclusion of theorem [ sc : ppt ] ( this was first noticed in @xcite ) .",
    "for example , figure [ fig ] shows sample distributions of eigenvalues of a partially transposed random state on @xmath104 , when @xmath105 and @xmath106 ( sample size @xmath12 in each case ) .    because of the link between random induced states and the wishart ensemble @xmath28 , theorem [ sc : ppt ] holds also for that ensemble ( real or complex ,",
    "although it is the complex setting that is most relevant to the quantum theory ) ; in that case the rescaling factor @xmath107 is not needed .",
    "we emphasize that this is rather unexpected since the asymptotic spectral density of the wishart ensemble _ itself _ is given by the marchenko ",
    "pastur distribution @xcite .",
    "-1 mm although theorems [ threshold : separability ] and [ threshold : ppt ] have similar statements , the tools used in their proofs are very different , which parallels the differences in the computational complexity of ppt vs. that of entanglement . however , combining all the tools is often necessary to obtain the full strength of the results .",
    "we first describe the proof of theorem [ threshold : separability ] , which is of geometric nature and where the concept of _ mean width _ plays a central role . to present it ,",
    "let us introduce basic concepts associated to a convex body @xmath108 containing the origin in the interior ( see @xcite for more background ) .",
    "the _ gauge _ of @xmath109 is the function @xmath110 defined for @xmath111 by -5 mm @xmath112    -1 mm the _ polar _ ( or dual ) body of @xmath109 is defined as -5 mm @xmath113    -2 mm if @xmath114 is a vector from the unit sphere @xmath115 , the _ support function _ of @xmath109 in the direction @xmath114 is @xmath116 .",
    "note that @xmath117 is the distance between the two hyperplanes tangent to @xmath109 and normal to @xmath114 .",
    "the mean width of @xmath109 is  then  defined  as @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the normalized spherical measure on @xmath115 .    in our setting ,",
    "the relevant convex body is @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the set of mixed separable states on @xmath18 .",
    "the ambient space @xmath122 is the space of self - adjoint trace @xmath12 operators on @xmath8 ( hence @xmath123 ) , where the maximally mixed state plays the role of the origin .",
    "since @xmath124 ( the bipolar theorem ) and since separability of @xmath11 is equivalent to @xmath125 , the crucial question is whether @xmath126 is smaller or larger than @xmath12 .",
    "an analysis of this question leads to the following value of the threshold function appearing in theorem [ threshold : separability ] -3 mm @xmath127 assertions ( i ) and ( ii ) can then be derived from concentration of measure , and the heart of the proof is showing , especially the upper bound .",
    "determining the threshold @xmath128 requires finding the typical value of the gauge associated to @xmath129 , computing which  as we mentioned  is a hard problem .",
    "we take an indirect route and find the order of magnitude of the threshold using the machinery of high - dimensional geometry , especially the so - called @xmath130-estimate .",
    "the @xmath130-estimate ( see @xcite ) is a general theorem which relates the mean width of a convex body and the mean width of its polar .",
    "while the abstract formulation may require an affine change of coordinates , in the present situation , because of the symmetries of @xmath129 ( invariance under local unitary conjugations ) , we can deduce via simple representation theory the inequalities @xmath131 -1.5 mm where @xmath132 is a universal constant .",
    "since @xmath133 can be estimated by standard techniques of high - dimensional probability @xcite , this allows to establish the order of magnitude of @xmath126 ( and hence of @xmath128 ) up to polylog factors .",
    "as indicated earlier , the same scheme yields estimates for the thresholds corresponding to other properties including the ppt , but it _ does not _ allow to recover the precise order @xmath45 appearing in theorem [ threshold : ppt ] .",
    "however , the latter result ( except for quantitative estimates on the probabilities , which require further work , again based on the concentration of measure ) follows readily from theorem [ sc : ppt ] , which describes very precisely the spectrum of the partial transpose of a random induced state : the ppt condition is equivalent to @xmath134 , which is generic if @xmath135 ; similarly , @xmath136 is generic if @xmath137  hence @xmath138 is the critical value . in turn , to show theorem [ sc : ppt ] we use the moment method , a standard technique from random matrix theory .",
    "the idea is to identify the asymptotic spectral density by computing its moments .",
    "this leads to problems in asymptotic combinatorics : the moments of semicircular distributions are given by the catalan numbers , corresponding to the dominant combinatorial terms , while the statements about convergence of extreme eigenvalues are proved by refining the calculations and carefully estimating contributions of lower order combinatorial terms .",
    "-1 mm we established that random induced states on @xmath58 exhibit a phase transition phenomenon with respect to the dimension @xmath17 of the ancilla space .",
    "we exemplified the phenomenon on two properties : positive partial transpose , for which the threshold value of @xmath17 is @xmath45 , and entanglement , for which the threshold is @xmath46 ( up to a polylog factor ) .",
    "this allows to determine whether two subsystems of an isolated system typically share ( or typically do not share ) entanglement when knowing only the sizes of those subsystems , and similarly for the ppt property .",
    "in fact , we provide a `` black box '' approach which applies to many natural properties of quantum states .",
    "our results motivate further study of the geometry of sets of quantum states , and that of large deviation behavior of some random matrix ensembles related to quantum information theory .",
    "we expect the probabilistic methods to continue to play a major role in quantum theory .",
    "indeed , the latter field usually involves high - dimensional objetcs ; for example , the quantum analogue of a byte ( a state on @xmath139  a qubyte , one may say ) `` lives '' in a space of dimension @xmath140 .",
    "while this makes numerical schemes mostly impractical ( the well - known _ curse of dimensionality _ ) , randomness is boosted by the presence of many free parameters ( one may call this phenomenon _ the blessing of dimensionality _ ) .",
    "the current level of understanding of these aspects of the theory is arguably comparable to that of combinatorics in the 1950 s , when the power of the probabilistic method @xcite began to be appreciated and , subsequently , the study of random graphs became an intensive area of research .",
