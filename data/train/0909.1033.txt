    "flows in compact ( two - dimensional ) surfaces are very well understood since the groundbreaking work of peixoto  @xcite .",
    "a theory of three - dimensional flows has steadily been developing since the characterization of robust invariant sets in @xcite .",
    "extensions of these techniques for higher - dimensional flows are well under way , see e.g. @xcite . for non - robust but persistent attractors , like the rovella attractor presented in @xcite , there is still no higher - dimensional analogue .    in a rather natural way ,",
    "since low dimensional dynamics is much better understood than the dynamics of general systems , the techniques used in the mathematical analysis of three - dimensional attractors for flows frequently depend on a dimensional reduction through projection along a stable manifold inside some poincar cross - section .",
    "this method yields a one - dimensional system whose dynamics can be nearly completely understood as well as the dynamics of its small perturbations .    in this work",
    "we start a rigorous study of a proposed higher dimensional analogue of the three - dimensional rovella ( or _ contracting lorenz _ ) attractor .",
    "other examples of higher dimensional chaotic attractors have been recently presented , e.g. by bonatti , pumario and viana in @xcite and by @xcite , but these are robust sets , while our construction leads to a persistent attractor .    in @xcite ,",
    "bonatti , pumarino and viana define a uniformly expanding map on a higher - dimensional torus , suspend it as a time - one map of a flow , and then singularize the flow adding a singularity in a convenient flow - box .",
    "this procedure creates a new dynamics on the torus presenting a multidimensional version of the one - dimensional expanding lorenz - like map , and a flow with _ robust multidimensional lorenz - like attractors _ : the singularity contained in the attractor may have any number of expanding eigenvalues , and _ the attractor remains transitive in a whole neighbourhood of the initial flow . _",
    "the construction in @xcite is also robust but yields a quasi - attractor : the attracting invariant set is not transitive but it is the maximal chain recurrence class in its neighborhood . for the case of the lorenz attractor and singular - hyperbolic attractors in general see e.g.  @xcite and @xcite .    ; on the right , the lorenz one - dimensional transformation.,title=\"fig:\",width=302,height=188 ] @xmath1 ; on the right , the lorenz one - dimensional transformation.,title=\"fig:\",width=188 ]    the quotient of the return map to the global cross - section over the stable directions ( see figure  [ fig : geom - lorenz ] ) is the one - dimensional lorenz transformation .",
    "our goal is to construct a flow such that `` after the identification by the stable directions '' , the first return map in a certain cross section @xmath2 is a multidimensional version of the one - dimensional rovella - map  @xcite .",
    "a rovella - like attractor is the maximal invariant set of a geometric flow whose construction is very similar to the one that gives the geometric lorenz attractor , @xcite , except for the fact that the eigenvalues relation @xmath3 there is replaced by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the weakest contractive eigenvalue at the origin .",
    "we remark that , unlike the one - dimensional lorenz map obtained from the usual construction of the geometric lorenz attractor , a one - dimensional rovella map has a criticality at the origin , caused by the eigenvalue relation @xmath7 at the singularity . in figure",
    "[ fig : contractinglorenz ] we present some possible `` rovella one - dimensional maps '' obtained through quotienting out the stable direction of the return map to the global cross - section of the attractor , as in figure  [ fig : geom - lorenz ] .",
    "the interplay between expansion away from the critical point with visits near the criticality prevents this system to have uniform expansion and also prevents robustness , that is , the attractor is not transitive on a whole neighborhood of the original flow . however the rovella attractors are _",
    "persistent_. that is , _ for generic parameterized families of vector fields passing through the original vector field @xmath8 , the parameters corresponding to transitive attractors , with the same features of the rovella attractor , form a positive lebesgue measure subset and have positive density at @xmath8 . _ see  @xcite for the full statement .",
    "rovella - like and lorenz - like attractors appear naturally in the generic unfolding of resonant double homoclinic loops , see e.g. @xcite .    in our construction",
    "we follow the same strategy of @xcite with two main differences .",
    "on the one hand , since we aim at a multidimensional rovella - like map , we have to deal with critical regions , that is , regions where the derivative of the return map to a global cross - section vanishes .",
    "because of this , proving the existence of non - trivial attractors for the flow arising from such construction requires a more careful analysis .",
    "indeed , as in the one - dimensional case , depending on the dynamics of the critical region , every attractor for the return map may be periodic ( trivial ) .",
    "on the other hand , our construction leads to the presence of a pair of hyperbolic saddle equilibria accumulated by regular orbits inside the attractor but _ with different indexes _ ( the dimension of their stable manifolds ) .",
    "this feature creates extra difficulties for the analysis of the possible dynamics arising under small perturbations of the flow .",
    "typically , when the critical region is non - recurrent ( misiurewicz maps in one - dimensional dynamics ) , most of the difficulties introduced by the critical region can be bypassed .",
    "that is one of the main reasons for us to construct a kind of multidimensional misiurewicz dynamics . in general , such critical regions in dimension greater than one",
    "are sub - manifolds , and one can not rule out that they intersect each other under the action of the dynamics . albeit this , we shall exhibit a class of multidimensional misiurewicz endomorphisms that appears naturally in a flow dynamics .",
    "we start with a basic dynamics presenting an expanding invariant torus @xmath9 that will absorve the image of the critical region after the singularization of the associated flow . by topological reasons ,",
    "this map can not be seen as a time - one map of a suspension flow : locally its degree is not constant . to bypass this new difficulty",
    ", we realize this map as a first return map of a flow with singularities ( after identification by stable directions ) .",
    "afterwards , we singularize a periodic orbit of this flow , i.e. we introduce a new singularity @xmath10 of saddle - type , with @xmath11-dimensional unstable manifold and @xmath12-dimensional stable manifold . moreover , all the eigenvalues of @xmath10 are real and if @xmath13 , and @xmath14 denote the stable and the unstable eigenvalues at @xmath10 respectively , then @xmath15 for @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we say that this kind of singularity is a _ rovella - like singularity_. the resulting flow will present a multidimensional transitive _ rovella - like attractor _ , supporting a physical measure .",
    "the existence of the physical / srb measure for the original flow is obtained taking advantage of the fact that , through identification of stable leaves , we can project the dynamics of the first return map of the flow to a global cross - section into a one - dimensional transformation with a misiurewicz critical point .",
    "moreover we point out that _ the analysis of the dynamics of most perturbations of our flow can not be easily reduced ( perhaps not at all ) to a one - dimensional model_. this indicates that intrinsic multidimensional tools should be developed to fully understand this class of flows .",
    "in addition , considering the perturbation of this flow along parametrized families we can show the existence of many parameters for which nearby flows exhibit an attractor with a unique physical measure by using the construction of a poincar return map to a cross - section of the flow exhibiting partial hyperbolicity and taking advantage of this weak hyperbolicity through a multidimensional extension of arguments of benedicks - carleson type . that is",
    ", we analyze the return of the orbits of the multidimensional critical set to itself under certain natural assumptions of slow recurrence and asymptotic expansion .      in what follows",

    "therefore the tangent map @xmath1052 to @xmath1053 always has maximal rank and clearly is injective with a compact domain , thus @xmath1053 is an embedding .",
    "this completes the induction argument and proves the existence of an embedding @xmath1054 .",
    "[ rmk : embedd - b2 ] this argument is also true if we start with an embedding of @xmath1023 into @xmath1055 so that we obtain an embedding of @xmath293 into @xmath1056 for all @xmath625 .",
    "but we need one extra dimension to deal with the solid torus in what follows .",
    "_ it is crucial to observe that the entire inductive construction just presented is built over nested tubular neighborhoods .",
    "_ indeed , the image of @xmath1057 is contained in a tubular neighborhood of the image of @xmath1053 for each @xmath625 . in the above construction we consider the tubular neighborhood of @xmath1053 in @xmath132 .",
    "however since we proceed inductively using orthogonal bundles of the successive images of @xmath1058 , and we contract the diameter of the tubular neighborhood at each step by a constant factor @xmath1010 , we have in fact that _ the image of @xmath1059 is in a tubular neighborhood of @xmath1060 for all @xmath1061 . _",
    "therefore , the distance between the image @xmath1059 and the image of @xmath1053 is bounded by @xmath1062 , always _ inside _ a tubular neighborhood @xmath1063 of @xmath1064 in @xmath1065 .",
    "hence there exists a projection @xmath1066 associated to this tubular neighborhood , for each @xmath625 and @xmath1067 .",
    "the previous discussion provides an embedding @xmath1053 of @xmath293 into @xmath300 for each @xmath625 . therefore considering a tubular neighborhood @xmath1068 of the compact submanifold @xmath1064 in @xmath300 we obtain a projection @xmath1069 such that @xmath1070 is a @xmath112-disk .",
    "thus we obtain an embedding @xmath1071 of @xmath1072 into @xmath300 .",
    "we can assume that the tubular neighborhood has radius smaller than @xmath1073 and that @xmath1074 for all @xmath1075 .",
    "then we can consider the projections @xmath1076 and @xmath1077 . in",
    "what follows we assume without loss of generality that @xmath1068 is the image of @xmath1071 .",
    "the previous construction of the embeddings @xmath1053 of @xmath293 depends on the initial embedding @xmath1025 of @xmath1023 on @xmath1024 .",
    "moreover it is clear that each of the embeddings @xmath1053 for @xmath1078 depend smoothly on @xmath1025 .",
    "hence a smooth family @xmath1079 of embeddings , for @xmath1020 $ ] , defines a smooth family @xmath1080 of corresponding higher dimensional embeddings .",
    "we can construct this family as depicted so that the extreme elements of the family satisfy @xmath1083 for @xmath1084 .",
    "if we choose a small tubular neighborhood of the image of @xmath1079 , then we obtain a family of embeddings @xmath1085 of @xmath1086 such that @xmath1087 .      again taking a small tubular neighborhood of the image of @xmath1080",
    "we obtain a family of embeddings @xmath1088 of @xmath1005 such that the image of @xmath1089 of @xmath1005 is compactly contained inside the image of @xmath1090 .    due to the nested construction",
    ", for each @xmath625 we have @xmath1091 after projecting into the lower dimensional image .",
    "moreover projecting on the previous stage of the construction we get @xmath1092 , which can easily be proved by induction on @xmath625 following the nested construction presented above .",
    "this is enough to prove that ( independently of the definition of @xmath1009 in @xmath10 ) @xmath1093 finally , since by definition @xmath1089 is a small tubular neighborhood of the image of @xmath1094 , and this set is contained inside a tubular neighborhood of the image of @xmath1095 , then from we see that in fact there exists a family of contractions @xmath1096 such that @xmath1097 .",
