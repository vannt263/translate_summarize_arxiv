    "when a dilute bose gas is cooled below the degeneracy temperature , the bosonic atoms all condense in the same one - particle state and a bose - einstein condensate forms .",
    "this has been convincingly demonstrated with magnetically trapped , evaporatively cooled atomic gases for a multitude of atom species . moreover , magnetic or optical traps can be equally well loaded with fermionic isotopes , such as @xmath0li or @xmath1k .",
    "these atoms do not undergo bose - einstein condensation , but fill up a fermi sea , as has been demonstrated through the observation of the pauli blocking effect @xcite and through a measurement of the total energy of the fermi gas @xcite . very soon after the observation of a degenerate fermi sea of atoms , researchers embarked upon the quest to achieve cooper pairing in the dilute fermi gas . indeed , for metals we know that the fermi sea is unstable with respect to cooper pair formation .",
    "so , if the ( neutral ) atoms in the dilute gas attract each other , a similar instability towards a paired state is to be expected .",
    "the interatomic interactions in ultracold gases are remarkable for two reasons .",
    "firstly , the collisions between the atoms can be satisfactorily characterized by a single number , the @xmath2-wave scattering length @xmath3 . for low - energy collisions ,",
    "the effective interaction potential between atoms becomes a contact potential , @xmath4 where @xmath5 with @xmath6 the mass of the atoms .",
    "the scattering length can be both positive ( leading to interatomic repulsion ) or negative ( attraction ) .",
    "secondly , this scattering length can be tuned by an external magnetic field when a feshbach resonance is present @xcite .",
    "this resonance occurs when the energy of a bound ( molecular ) state in a closed scattering channel becomes equal to the energy of the colliding atoms in the open scattering channel .",
    "the different channels correspond here to different hyperfine states of the trapped atoms , and the distance in energy between these states can be tuned with a magnetic field .    in what follows",
    ", we will consider a trapped mixture of @xmath1k atoms in the @xmath7 and @xmath8 hyperfine states .",
    "this potassium isotope is fermionic , and the trapped states display a feshbach resonance at @xmath9 gauss . when the scattering length is tuned to a negative value , the atoms attract and cooper pairs can form leading to a _ bcs regime_. the critical temperature for cooper pairing can be raised by making the scattering length more strongly negative . when the scattering length is large and positive , the molecular state in the closed channel is populated , and molecules appear that can be bose - einstein condensed ( the _ bec regime _ ) .",
    "the adaptability of the scattering length allows bringing the gas from the bcs regime into the bec regime or vice versa , and allows studying the interesting intermediate ` crossover ' regime .",
    "the first experimental realization of superfluidity of a fermi gas in the molecular bec  regime came in 2003 @xcite .",
    "a condensate of molecules was convincingly observed .",
    "the detection of superfluidity in the bcs regime however is much more subtle . in an initial experiment @xcite ,",
    "the superfluid behavior was derived from the hydrodynamic nature of the expansion of the cloud , as compared to a ballistic expansion expected for a non - superfluid weakly - interacting fermi gas @xcite . however",
    ", this did not constitute unambiguous proof , since the fermi gas was in the strongly interacting regime .",
    "subsequent experiments probed superfluidity by mapping the pair density onto a molecular condensate density @xcite or by spectroscopically measuring the gap @xcite . yet although these experimental methods clearly demonstrate pairing , they do not unambiguously demonstrate superfluid behavior .",
    "[ ptb ]    optlatt.eps    the very recent observation of a lattice of quantized vortices in resonant fermi gases @xcite constitutes the first clear demonstration of superfluidity in the bec / bcs regime",
    ". observation of these vortices well in the bcs regime may be difficult since the fermionic density penetrates in the core of the vortex in the bcs regime , leading to a loss of contrast in direct imaging @xcite .",
    "another possibility to demonstrate superconductivity is though the observation of the josephson effect @xcite in optical lattices .",
    "these optical lattices are periodic potentials formed by two counterpropagating laser beams , for example in the @xmath10-direction:@xmath11 where @xmath12 is the laser wave length , @xmath13 is the recoil energy , and @xmath2 is the laser intensity expressed in units of the recoil energy .",
    "typically , @xmath14 , @xmath15 nm . the atoms collect in the valleys of the optical lattice and form a `` stack of pancakes '' , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ optlatt ] . typically , there are on the order of a few 100 ` pancakes ' with on the order of 1000 atoms each .",
    "when a superfluid is loaded in such an optical lattice , the system corresponds to an array of josephson junctions . in such an array ,",
    "the superfluid gas can propagate whereas the normal state gas is pinned .",
    "this has already been demonstrated for bosonic atoms @xcite , and has been predicted theoretically for fermionic atoms @xcite .    in this contribution , we derive and discuss the critical josephson current for the flow of the superfluid component through an optical lattice .",
    "for this purpose , we base ourselves on the path - integral description as applied by randeria and co - workers @xcite to the bec / bcs crossover model of high - t@xmath16 superconductors . in section",
    "ii , we give an overview of the application of path - integrals to the system of ultracold fermions , and in section iii we present our results for the critical current .",
    "the partition function for the atomic fermi gas is given by the functional integral@xmath17 with an action@xmath18 the fermionic fields @xmath19 are grassman variables .",
    "the interaction potential , as discussed in the previous section , is a contact potential with experimentally adjustable strength @xmath20 .",
    "the two hyperfine states are denoted by @xmath21 .",
    "the functional integral over the grassman variables can be performed analytically only for an action that is quadratic in @xmath22 . in order",
    "to get rid of the quartic term in ( [ s1 ] ) we perform a hubbard - stratonovic ( hs ) transformation , introducing auxiliary bosonic fields @xmath23 and @xmath24 : @xmath25 with @xmath26 indeed , performing the functional integral over the hs fields @xmath27,@xmath24 in ( [ s2 ] ) brings us back to ( [ s1 ] ) .",
    "our goal is an investigation of the superfluid properties of the ultracold fermi system . for a straightforward hydrodynamic interpretation of the hubbard - stratonovic fields ,",
    "it is advantageous to work with @xmath28 and @xmath29 . these are related to the original hs field by @xmath30 .",
    "we have restricted the functional integral to @xmath31 without neglecting any field configurations of importance to the final result .",
    "the hydrodynamic interpretation of @xmath32 is the density of fermion pairs , whereas @xmath33 can be interpreted as the superfluid velocity field . performing this change of variables in the functional integral yields@xmath34 with@xmath35 de palo et al .",
    "@xcite suggest at this point to introduce additional collective quantum variables to extract the fermionic density .",
    "however , care must be taken , since when additional collective quantum fields are present the problem of double - counting poses itself @xcite , and variational perturbation theory has to be applied to avoid double - counting @xcite .",
    "however , in the present case it is not necessary to explicitly introduce the additional collective variables to obtain information about the atomic density profile @xcite . in ( [ z3 ] )",
