    "the large area telescope ( lat ) on board _ fermi _ _ gamma - ray space telescope _ has opened a new window for observing gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) from the range of 20 mev to 300 gev ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "the discovery of these correlations can provide critical insights into crucial areas of grb physics that are not yet completely understood . although some outliers were found in the tight correlations @xmath11-@xmath12 ( e.g. , grb071010b ; urata et al .",

    "this burst was detected by all four of the wam shields , and its light curve is shown with 1 s time resolution in figure [ wamlc ] .",
    "the duration @xmath18 was @xmath19 s which places it in the class of long duration events .",
    "we also performed the spectral analysis using the wam transient data with 55 energy channels and 1-s time resolution .",
    "we used the data from the wam2 detector only because this particular grb was situated on a direction along the normal vector of the wam2 .",
    "the wam2 spectrum was extracted by integrating over t0@xmath101.5 s to t0 + 24.5 s with the hxdmkwamspec in the standard headas 6.9 package provided by nasa / gsfc .",
    "the background spectrum was estimated by incorporating the best - fit model of source - free time region on both sides ( t0@xmath10504.5 to t0@xmath104.5 and t0 + 37.5 to t0 + 237.5 ) of the burst time region .",
    "the energy response was calculated by the wam response generator version 1.9 @xcite .",
    "we performed the spectral fitting in xspec version 12.5 and found that the best - fit model was the grb band function ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "two other models we also attempted were a power - law ( @xmath21 ) and a power - law with an exponential cutoff ( @xmath22 ) .",

    "this result was consistent with @xcite .",
    "we also confirmed the temporal extended emissions .",
    "we performed the optical afterglow observations using the canada france hawaii telescope ( cfht)/megacam within the framework of the eafon @xcite .",
    "the @xmath30-band monitoring observations covered the duration from 5.2 days to 57.6 days after the burst .",
    "additional @xmath31- and @xmath32-band images were taken on the night of 2010 april 20 ( 6.2 days after the burst ) .",
    "because of the bright moon phase , there was no optical observation between 7 and 26 days .",
    "the standard cfht s data pipeline reduced all of the data .",
    "figure [ optlc ] shows the @xmath31- , @xmath30- and @xmath32-band light curves with several gcn points @xcite .",
    "the light curves demonstrated the steep decay occurring between 3 and 7 days after the burst .",
    "the temporal indices were @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 in @xmath31- , @xmath30- , and @xmath32-bands , respectively .",
    "as shown in figure [ optlc ] the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of optical afterglow during the steep decay phase ( at @xmath366.2 days ) could be satisfactorily expressed according to a simple power law with the spectral index @xmath37 .",
    "after the 35 days , a possible host galaxy component dominated . because there was no significant brightness change between 35.2 and 57.6 days , we estimated the brightness of the host to be @xmath38 ab mag .",
    "the afterglow at 27.2 days exhibited clear excess from the brightness of the host galaxy .",
    "the excess was also fairly inconsistent with the extrapolation of the afterglow component .",
    "the prior optical afterglow of grb100414a ( @xmath39 days ) exhibited power - law decays with temporal break at approximately @xmath40 days . despite the paucity of observations for the optical afterglow , the joint light curve using _",
    "swift_/uvot strongly suggested a temporal break .",
    "the decay indices before and after the break were @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively , fully consistent with typical well - observed long grb optical afterglows . comparing the sample ( listed in @xcite )",
    "revealed that the optical afterglow brightness at 2 days exhibited average brightness or was rather brighter than those of long grbs afterglows .    to examine whether the jet model is applicable to present afterglow , we utilized the relations by @xcite and calculated @xmath43 and @xmath15 based on the observed @xmath16 .",
    "the observed values were in agreement with the calculated value of @xmath44 , assuming that we were observing a jet expansion phase in the frequency range above the synchrotron cooling .",
    "in addition , although the x - ray afterglow observation was also poor , the decay index @xmath45 between 2.0 and 7.4 days was also consistent with the jet model .",
    "the case of wind density profile with @xmath46 also satisfied the closure relation .",
    "however , it is unlikely for the late ( @xmath47 days ) afterglow .",
    "we also attempted to fit the @xmath31-band light curve including the uvot data using the broken power - law model by fixing the temporal decay indices of former and post jet break at @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "the uvot data were calibrated according to the sdss field stars that have similar colors to the grb afterglow , and were converted to @xmath31 band magnitudes . as shown in figure [ optlc ] , we successfully fitted the light curve and obtained the jet break time as @xmath50 days .",
    "( figure [ optlc ] ) .",
    "the jet opening angle derived from this temporal break was @xmath51 , consistent with those of other well - observed long grbs .      the abundance of the multi - wavelength data for estimating the jet break time makes grb100414a one of the most favorable targets for evaluating the @xmath8 and @xmath52 relations of studies that had stagnated because of a lack of data on the @xmath53 estimation and long - term optical monitoring .",
    "in particular , the current event was the first _ fermi _ /lat detected event exhibiting the clear jet break features .    to examine the correlations with the least systematics errors",

    "the value is slightly smaller than that of the estimation ( 2.3@xmath55 erg ) using _ fermi _",
    "/gbm @xcite .",
    "the most likely reason for this inconsistency is that the energy range of _",
    "suzaku_/wam is insufficient in detecting the underlying power - law component in the _ fermi _ /lat - gbm spectrum@xcite .",
    "grb090510 was the short event , and the spectral parameters were not effectively constrained , we excluded this event for the evaluation of correlation .",
    "the marginal optical temporal break time @xmath56 of grb090926a and grb090902b was reported by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . as summarized in table [ tbl-2 ] , the values vary widely according to the estimation methods .",
    "we also excluded the grb091003 for the evaluation of the @xmath57 relation because of a lack of the @xmath58 estimation .",
    "interestingly , the three selected events ( grb090926a , grb090902b and the current one ) shared commonality in the delayed highest energy photons from their main burst ( grb090926a ; ackermann et al .",
    "2011 , grb090902b ; abdo et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "figure [ grel ] shows the @xmath8 and @xmath59 relations with _",
    "suzaku_/wam observed lat - detected events .",
    "we found that all four events were highly consistent with previous studies of the @xmath8 .",
    "as shown in figure [ grel ] , the measured values of current event ( @xmath60 kev and @xmath61 erg ) adhered closely to the @xmath8 relation .",
    "although the background grb physic of this correlation is not yet completely understood , the characteristics of different sub - classes of grbs become apparent ( amati 2006 ) . to compare other categories of the events ( e.g. , short duration grbs and sub - energetic events ) , we plotted them in figure [ grel ] .",
    "these features were clearly different from those of the current event .",
    "the present event and grb 090902b were also consistent with @xmath59 correlation ( figure [ grel ] ) . in the case of grb090926a",
    ", @xmath12 thoroughly depends on the jet break time estimation .",
    "the late afterglow indicated a flatter evolution with the significant excess at @xmath62 days ( 11.5 days in the rest frame ) .",
    "the flatter component in the light curve was due to the contribution from the host galaxy of grb100414a .",
    "the estimated brightness of the host was consistent with those of typical host galaxies at @xmath63 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the most straightforward explanation for the excess in the late afterglow light curve ( approximately 27.2 days ) is that grb 100414 was accompanied by a contemporaneous sn .",
    "several grbs have bumps in the optical light curves approximately 1@xmath365 days in the rest frame ( e.g. , grbs 030329 , 090323 , 090328 ) that can be interpreted by refreshed shocks ( e.g. , @xcite ) or late central engine activity . however , the appearance time of the current event is significantly later .",
    "the recent spectroscopic confirmation of the grb@xmath10sn connection on the typical long grb with the standard optical afterglow light curve while obeying the @xmath8 relation @xcite is also one of the most encouraging results supporting the sn association . although spectroscopic confirmations are required , discussing the photometric evaluation is still vital . in particular , in the case of rare _ fermi _",
    "/lat events , light curve evaluation is usually sufficient for the first step .",
    "several grbs are associated with sn components , whose rise times and peak magnitudes are constrained by their optical afterglow light curves .",
    "the grb@xmath10sn are globally similar regarding the rise times and peak magnitudes .",
    "the peak times tend to be clustered in 10@xmath1020 days after the burst in the rest frame , and the absolute magnitudes are usually approximately @xmath64 mag . to examine the consistency of the possible sn component",
    ", we added the light curve template of sn1998bw to the grb100414a s host galaxy and afterglow with scaling to the redshift of @xmath4 , and fixed the peak time at 27.2 days .",
    "this was because having less observational data points meant that constraining the peak time was not possible .",
    "although the peak time at 27.2 days ( 12.2 days in the rest frame ) was earlier than those of the grb@xmath10sn events , it was still consistent with the global feature , especially for the grb060218a case . as shown in figure [ optlc ] , the combined light curve was marginally consistent with the observational results .",
    "this implies that the energetic grb100414a was linked to a core collapse supernova .",
    "the aforementioned discussions suggest that the current event show no significant differences with long duration grbs detected in pre-_swift_and _ swift_eras , despite energetic gev radiation . by combining the features of the bumps in the optical light curves and correlations",
    ", we concluded that the progenitor of the current event was likely the massive stars .",
