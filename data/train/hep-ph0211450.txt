    "it is our purpose here to build a simple model for these quantities .",
    "phenomenological quark models , which possess some non - perturbative aspects and which are rather successful in reproducing low - energy properties of hadrons , are expected to help us understand the connection between deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) data and non - pertubative inputs .",
    "for very simple systems such as pions and other low - mass mesons , there exist some effective models ( _ e.g. _ the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model ) that incorporate , in some simplified way , special qcd features such as spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and anomalies .",
    "however , investigations of the structure functions along these lines have given rather different results  @xcite .",
    "this situation originates from the fact that the njl model needs to be regularized and that different regularizations yield different results .",

    "the second involves crossed quark lines and is related to processes where the two photons ( in the @xmath9 scattering ) are connected to different quark lines .",
    "this is incompatible with a probabilistic interpretation in terms of structure functions . as we will conclude from the calculations , contributions of this kind are fortunately higher - twists , _",

    "we shall use the following definition of the longitudinal polarisation vector , @xmath35    one has @xmath36    for the linear transverse polarisation vectors , we use the following definition : @xmath37    this and eq .

    "@xcite , this is equivalent to setting a cut - off for the square of the relative momentum of the quarks inside the pion , which can be considered as resulting from the finite size of the pion .",
    "irrespectively of the factors arising in the extraction of the structure functions ( see section  ( [ sec : sfnp_sig&w1 ] ) ) , we can simply convince ourselves that in the presence of a cut - off the contribution of the crossed diagrams ( the first photon hits a quark and the second an antiquark ) are higher - twists , by plotting the ratio of these two contributions as a function of @xmath1 .",

    "the presence of a cut - off implies the breakdown of gauge invariance .",
    "this is the main reason why one commonly uses other regularization methods such as pauli - villars or dimensional regularization . in the context of an effective theory , a simple momentum cut - off has the critical advantage that the regularization parameter ( which is kept to a finite value ) can be interpreted as a physical one . in the case of dimensional regularization ,",
    "the signification of fractional dimensional space is not at all clear . as for pauli - villars regularization , the introduction of wrong - sign fermionic contribution is not intuitive .    nevertheless , in our model , as the intermediate states in @xmath51 are on - shell , the cut - off on the internal loop momentum vertex .",
    "] acts on a physical observable , that is @xmath6 of the process @xmath52 .",
    "the conclusion is thus staightforward : this cut - off does not break gauge invariance .",
    "this procedure would have been fully justified if we had only one pion vertex , and thus one condition to implement .",
    "but we have two vertices with two different expressions for the relative momenta . to keep gauge invariance",
    ", the cut - off on @xmath6 must be on the overall cross - section as the physical observable is the full cross - section ( the square of the sum of the two diagrams ) at a given @xmath6 .    to keep the constraint coming from the pion size",
    ", we should have imposed two conditions on the cross - section to be integrated over @xmath6 . however , this would have given zero .",
    "as a makeshift we imposed one condition or the other .    even if the physical interpretation is not so obvious , we thus kept gauge invariance , information from the pion size , suppressed the crossed diagrams and hence obtained an interpretation in terms of structure functions .",
    "at this stage we have calculated the polarised cross - sections and we should be able to link them to the structure functions for neutral pion . before doing this , we shall first recall some mandatory formulae derived from the analysis of deep inelastic proton scattering .",

    ", we can now extract the functions @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "inverting for @xmath7 and @xmath8 , we get @xmath66 and @xmath67    we then get @xmath54 and @xmath55 through the usual scaling relations : @xmath68 still with @xmath57 for the hadron mass .",
    "the structure functions can now be related to the ( valence ) quark distributions : @xmath69 @xmath70 we stress that the last relation , known as the callan - gross relation , comes out of our calculation .",
    "this does indicate that our approximations have been done consistently and the leading - twist results are the same , except for the charge coefficients entering eq .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) . ] .",
    "so far , we have only described the model . in order to make predictions",
    ", we need to fix its parameters , namely @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the latter can be thought of as the normalisation of the quark wave function , and we determine it by imposing that there are only two constituent quarks in the pion . in our model ,",
    "the valence quark distributions are equal @xmath74 the condition @xmath75 then yields @xmath76 as @xmath77 is a function , not only of @xmath72 and @xmath71 , but also of @xmath78 , this gives us a coupling constant that evolves with @xmath78 .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath73 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] ( right ) : for a finite cut - off @xmath71 , the cross - section at fixed @xmath73 would grow with energy , until the pion reaches its maximum allowed size , in which case the cross section would remain constant . if we impose relation eq .",
    "( [ normf1 ] ) , this means that @xmath79 will first decrease until the cut - off makes it reach a plateau for @xmath80 ( in practice , the plateau is reached around @xmath81 ) .",
    "the plateau value depends on @xmath82 ( and @xmath83 ) .     which fulfill the sum rule ( eq .  ( [ normf1 ] ) ) , for the values of the parameters indicated at the top.,title=\"fig:\",width=377 ]      to constrain further our parameters , we can try to use the momentum sum rule @xmath84 in the parton model , this integral should be equal to 1 as @xmath85 , as we do not have gluons in the model .",
    "analyzing fig .",
    "[ fig : f4 ] , it is clear that  at least for a finite value of @xmath50 the momentum sum rule is violated .",
    "for instance the momentum carried by the quarks at large @xmath1 is @xmath86 for @xmath87 mev and @xmath88 mev .    ) , as a function of @xmath1 , for the values of the parameters indicated at the top of the figure.,title=\"fig:\",width=453 ]    nevertheless , there are two limits of our model that fulfill the condition @xmath89 automatically and for which the quarks carry the entire momentum of the pion .",
    "first of all , if we do not impose that the pion has a finite size , then asymptotically we get @xmath90@xmath91 . in the limit @xmath92",
    ", we obtain the simple expression @xmath93 this means that in that regime , for sufficiently high @xmath78 , the quarks behave as free particles , and the usual derivation based on the ope holds @xcite .    the second case where this holds confirms this interpretation : if we impose @xmath94 , the expressions we have given develop an infrared divergence , which corresponds to the case where both quarks emerging from the pion are on - shell and free .",
    "this divergence can be re - absorbed into the normalisation eq .",
    "( [ normf1 ] ) of @xmath73 , and the sum rule @xmath89 is again automatically satisfied at large @xmath1",
    ".    however , in the physical pion case , it makes more sense to consider that one of the quarks remains off - shell : the introduction of a cut - off changes the sum rule value , as the fields can never be considered as free .",
    "hence , because of the goldstone nature of the pion , one expects that the momentum sum rule will take a smaller value than in the case of other hadrons .",
    "this may explain why fits that assume the same momentum fraction for valence quarks in protons and pions @xcite do not seem to leave any room for sea quarks @xcite .",
    "we come back to the results for @xmath95 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f4 ] .",
    "again , the curves show a plateau at sufficiently large @xmath78 , with a value depending on @xmath82 and @xmath83 . it is easy to show that this value is always smaller than 1 as it can be guessed from fig .  [",

    "]    following the discussion in  @xcite , we choose the following conservative values for the remaining parameters of our model : @xmath96  mev or @xmath97  mev and @xmath98  mev .       for the neutral pion .",

    "some of our results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] , for @xmath1 = 2  gev@xmath2 .",
    "the most striking feature is the vanishing of this function for @xmath101 larger than some value @xmath102 .",
    "this is again due to the fact that , because the quarks are not free in this model , the actual value of their mass does matter .",
    "it can clearly be seen that this effect originates from kinematical cuts ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    as a result , putting",
    "the cut quarks on - shell will be easier for small than for large @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath101-distribution ( @xmath54 ) is expected to be enhanced on the low @xmath101 side , leading to a momentum fraction smaller than unity . the vanishing at large @xmath101 is not obtained in similar works , in particular in the one of ref .  @xcite . in this reference ,",
    "the bjorken limit is taken first and the kinematical constraint is not applied .",
    "this procedure seems questionable for evaluating cross - sections at finite @xmath1 .",
    "we have discussed the simplest model allowing to relate @xmath103 to the pion quark distributions .",
    "the model consists in calculating the simplest diagrams for a @xmath104 coupling between pion and constituent quark fields .",
    "we show that the crossed diagrams , which are to be included in order to guarantee gauge invariance , preclude the existence of the relation between the the cross - section and the quark distribution .",
    "the introduction of a cut - off on @xmath6 allows such a relation without breaking gauge invariance .",
    "the cut - off on @xmath6 being equivalent to a cut - off on the square of the relative momentum of the quarks inside pion , this effect can be traced back to the finite size of the pion . for reasonable value of the cut - off ,",
    "the crossed diagrams become negligible as soon as @xmath1 is larger than 2 gev@xmath2 allowing quark distributions to be meaningful even for relatively small @xmath1 .",
    "one of the most important outcomes of our calculation is the deviation from the momentum sum rule .",
    "however , we recover this sum rule ( @xmath105 ) in two limiting cases , which correspond to free quarks .",
    "the first one is the limit @xmath106 .",
    "the second one is for @xmath107 .",
    "then , an infrared divergence appears , which can be reabsorbed into the normalisation of @xmath108 and the momentum sum rule is again recovered for large @xmath1 .",
    "hence , the violation of the sum rule can tentatively be attributed to the goldstone boson nature of the pion .",
