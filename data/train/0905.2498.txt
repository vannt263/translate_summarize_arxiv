    "since the early days of high - energy gamma - ray astronomy it has become clear that the gamma - ray flux received at earth is dominated by emission from the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "this emission can be well understood in terms of cosmic - ray interactions with the interstellar medium @xcite . at energies",
    "@xmath0  mev , the generation of diffuse gamma - ray emission is dominated by the decay of @xmath1 produced in collisions between cosmic - ray nuclei and interstellar medium nuclei . ultimately , the study of this hadronic gamma - ray emission may provide hints on the still mysterious origin of the galactic cosmic - rays .",
    "however , the interpretation of the galactic diffuse gamma - ray emission is complicated by the fact that a large number and variety of individual sources contribute along the line of sight to the observed emission , thus blurring the link between individual cosmic - ray acceleration sites and observed gamma - ray signatures in our galaxy .",
    "gamma rays from cosmic - ray interactions are also expected from nearby galaxies , and indeed , the egret telescope aboard the compton gamma - ray observatory ( _ cgro _ ) has for the first time detected gamma - ray emission from the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) @xcite .",
    "the lmc is an excellent target for studying the link between cosmic - ray acceleration and gamma - ray emission since this galaxy is nearby ( bringing the sources fluxes in reach of modern gamma - ray telescopes ) and since the system is nearly seen face - on ( avoiding the superposition of sources along the line of sight that hampers studies in our own galaxy ) .",
    "in addition , the lmc is rather active , housing many supernova remnants , bubbles and superbubbles and massive star forming regions that are all potential sites of cosmic - ray acceleration @xcite .",
    "the large area telescope ( lat ) aboard the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ ( fgst ) provides now the capabilities to study diffuse gamma - ray emission from nearby galaxies in depth , and of the lmc in particular @xcite .",
    "we report here on the initial analysis of observations taken in the course of the first year s all - sky survey by the lat .",
    "the lat is the primary instrument on the fgst satellite which has been launched from cape canaveral on june 11th , 2008 .",
    "the lat is an imaging , wide field - of - view , high - energy gamma - ray telescope , covering the energy range from below 20 mev to more than 300 gev .",
    "the lat is a pair - conversion telescope with a precision tracker made of a stack of 18 x , y silicon tracking planes and a calorimeter made of 96 csi(tl ) crystals .",
    "the tracker array is covered by a segmented anticoincidence shield allowing for the rejection of charged particle backgrounds .",
    "the lat has a large @xmath2  sr field of view , and compared to earlier gamma - ray missions , has a large effective area ( @xmath3  @xmath4 on axis at @xmath5  gev for the event selection used in this paper ) , improved angular resolution ( @xmath6 68% containment radius at 1 gev ) and low dead time ( @xmath7  @xmath8s per event ) .",
    "the @xmath9 energy resolution in the 100 mev - 10 gev energy range is better than @xmath10% .",
    "a detailed description of the instrument is given by @xcite .",
    "the on - orbit instrument calibration is presented by @xcite .",
    "the data used in this work covers the period august 8th 2008  april 24th 2009 and amounts to 211.7 days of continuous sky survey observations . during this period",
    "a total exposure of @xmath11  cm  s@xmath12 ( at 1 gev ) has been obtained for the lmc region .",
    "the data analysis presented in this paper has been performed using the version v9r11 and the instrument response functions p6_v3 .",
    "we collected all data obtained within the period august 8th 2008  april 24th 2009 and applied the _ diffuse event class _ filter that has been designed to minimize contamination by instrumental background while retaining a substantial fraction of the signal .",
    "as has been pointed out by @xcite , any harsher event cut would not significantly improve the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we further excluded from the data all periods where the spacecraft has entered the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) and for which the spacecraft z - axis points more than @xmath13 away from the zenith direction ( the zenith direction being defined by the vector running from the earth center through the spacecraft ) .",
    "while the saa cut excludes periods of particular large instrumental background from the analysis , the latter cut excludes periods where the earth enters the field of view .",
    "furthermore , to minimize contamination from earth albedo photons we exclude photons with zenith angles above @xmath14 from the analysis .",
    "we further restricted the analysis to photon energies above 200  mev where our current knowledge of the instrument response implies systematic uncertainties that are smaller than @xmath15 and where the redistribution of photons in energy due to incomplete energy measurements becomes negligible .      to illustrate the distribution of observed gamma - ray photons in the lmc region we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : image ] a counts - map of the area .",
    "the arrival directions of observed photons in the 200 mev - 100 gev energy range have been binned into @xmath16 large pixels covering a @xmath17 large area around the position @xmath18 .",
    "the binned map has then been smoothed using a 2d adaptive gaussian kernel smoothing technique @xcite to remove poissonian noise that arises from the relatively small number of counts that have been registered .",

    "the extinction scales linearly with total gas column density , and we chose 10 linearly spaced contours to allow the reader to visually appreciate the distribution of gas column densities in the lmc .",
    "obviously , a substantial fraction of the gas is found in a small area in the north of the lmc , at roughly @xmath20 , which coincides with the 30  doradus star forming region .     in this area of the sky .",

    "@xmath25 we find a total number of @xmath26 counts within the energy range 200 mev - 100 gev above the expected contributions from galactic diffuse emission , extragalactic diffuse emission , instrumental background , and the blazar crates  j060106 - 703606 .",
    "these background contributions have been estimated by fitting spatial and spectral templates of their emission components together with a spatial template for the lmc emission to the data .",
    "galactic diffuse emission has been modelled spatially and spectroscopically using the galprop model @xcite version 54_59xvarh7s while for the combination of extragalactic diffuse emission and residual instrumental background we assume an isotropic emission with a power law spectral distribution .",
    "crates  j060106 - 703606 is modeled as a point source at @xmath27 with a power - law spectral distribution . for the lmc we use the extinction map of @xcite as spatial template",
    "from which we subtract a pedestal level of @xmath28 from all pixels and for which we set all pixels outside a radius of @xmath29 around @xmath30 to zero in order to extract the lmc emission .",
    "as spectral model we assume a power law for the lmc .    to describe the morphology of the high - energy gamma - ray emission from the lmc we first fit a point source with free position and flux on top of the background model to our data .",
    "this results in a best - fitting point - source position of @xmath31 with a statistical 95% confidence error radius of @xmath32 ( the systematic position uncertainty is estimated to less than @xmath33 ) .",
    "we note that this position is close to that of r  136 , the central star cluster of 30  dor , which is located at @xmath34 , i.e. at an angular distance of @xmath35 from our best - fitted point - source location .",
    "the detection significance of the lmc can be estimated using the so - called _ test statistics _ ( ts ) which is defined as twice the difference between the log - likelihood @xmath36 that is obtained by fitting the lmc model on top of the background model to the data , and the log - likelihood @xmath37 that is obtained by fitting the background model only , i.e. @xmath38 . under the hypothesis that our model satisfactorily explains the _",
    "fermi_/lat data , ts follows a @xmath39 distribution with @xmath40 degrees of freedom , where @xmath40 is the number of free parameters in the lmc model @xcite . in the particular case of a point source with free position , flux and spectral index we have @xmath41 and the measured ts of 869.1 corresponds to a significance of @xmath42 .    as next step",
    "we replace the point source model by an extended source model which we implement as axisymmetric 2d gaussian shape with variable angular size @xmath43 .",
    "in addition to the size we again fitted the position , flux and power law spectral index of the source .",
    "this results in a best - fitting source position of @xmath44 ( with a 95% confidence radius of @xmath45 ) , and source extent of @xmath46 .",
    "the ts amounts to 1088.5 which is larger by 219.4 than the value obtained for the point - source model .",
    "since we added one additional parameter ( the source extent @xmath43 ) with respect to the point - source model we obtain the significance of the source extension from the @xmath47 distribution to @xmath48 .    alternatively to the geometrical models we also compare the _",
    "fermi_/lat data to various spatial templates that trace the interstellar matter distributions in the lmc .",
    "for neutral hydrogen ( h  i ) we use the aperture synthesis and multibeam data that @xcite have combined from atca and parkes observations . for molecular hydrogen",
    "we use co observations of the lmc obtained with the nanten telescope @xcite .",
    "we further used the extinction map of @xcite ( sfd ) as tracer of the total gas column density and compare also our data to the 100 @xmath8 m iris map that has been obtained by reprocessing the iras survey data @xcite .",
    "the results of this comparison are summarized together with that of the geometrical models in table [ tab : models ] .",
    "the best fits are obtained for the sfd extinction map and the iras 100 @xmath8 m infrared map which give ts values of @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "for 2 free parameters ( the total flux in the map and the spectral index ) this corresponds to a detection significance of @xmath51 .",
    "an almost equally good fit is obtained using the neutral hydrogen map .",
    "fitting instead the co map to the lat data provides a rather poor fit , suggesting that the gamma - ray morphology differs from that of molecular gas in the lmc .",
    "fitting the h  i and co maps together to the data confirms this result since the fit attributes @xmath52 of the total flux to the h  i component .",
    "correspondingly , the ts increase with respect to fitting the h  i gas map alone is also negligible .    the h  i / sfd / iris  100  @xmath8 m maps fit the data considerably better than a single point source , adding further evidence that the observed high - energy gamma - ray emission is extended in nature .",

    "cgro_. due to egret s limited angular resolution and the weak emission detected from the lmc , details of the spatial structure of the galaxy could not have been resolved .",

    "fermi_/lat allows now for the first time to clearly resolve the gamma - ray emission of the lmc and to attribute the emission maximum to the 30  dor star forming region .",
    "while this coincidence could be taken as a hint for an enhanced cosmic - ray density in 30  dor with respect to the rest of the galaxy , we note that a substantial fraction of the interstellar gas of the lmc is also confined to the 30  dor area .",
    "consequently , the target density for cosmic - ray interactions is greatly enhanced in this region which implies a corresponding enhancement of the gamma - ray luminosity . whether the data do also support an enhanced cosmic - ray density in 30  dor with respect to the rest of the galaxy needs a more detailed analysis of the observations",
    ".    the rather poor fit of the co map to the lat data suggests that the overall distribution of gamma - ray emission differs from that of molecular hydrogen .",
    "the distribution of neutral hydrogen fits the data considerably better and the combined fit of h  i and co maps indicates that any contribution to the gamma - ray emission that is correlated to the molecular gas is at best marginal .",
    "this agrees well with expectations since the gas budget of the lmc is largely ( 90 - 95% ) dominated by neutral hydrogen @xcite .",
    "consequently we are presently unable to determine the co - to - h@xmath62 conversion factor , x@xmath63 , from our lmc data .",

    "@xcite predicted an integrated @xmath61  mev photon flux of @xmath65  based on estimates of the lmc supernova rate and total gas densities .",
