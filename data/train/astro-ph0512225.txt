    "2004 ) , and the region is dominated by two radio continuum peaks designated cores a and b. these two principal cores are separated by @xmath25@xmath3 and are often referred to as the `` binary '' system with a mass of 0.49 m@xmath5 for core a and 0.61 m@xmath5 for core b ( looney , mundy & welch 2000 ) . moreover",
    ", the gas and dust toward core a appears to be at a higher temperature than core b and most of the molecular emission lines of high energy transitions have been detected exclusively toward core a. the measured dust temperature toward core b is @xmath240 k ( mundy et al .  1986 ) and the measured temperature toward core a from many different molecular species is between 80 and 200 k ( chandler et al .",

    "2004 ) mapped slightly lower energy transitions of ch@xmath0cn and ch@xmath0ocho with the plateau de bure interferometer , noting that all the molecular emission is contained toward cores a and b and that no large molecule emission is seen associated with the molecular outflows .",
    "recently , chandler et al .",
    "( 2005 ) detected large abundances of a number of different organic molecular species primarily located toward core a from sma observations .",

    "( 2005 ) suggest that there must be material from an extended molecular envelope falling onto an embedded dust disk and that there may be a low - velocity outflow coming from an embedded protostar .",
    "the discovery of large oxygen and nitrogen bearing molecules in a low - mass star forming region is significant because the molecular complexity appears to be similar to high - mass star forming regions .",
    "such complex molecules undoubtedly are incorporated into subsequent formation of protoplanetary bodies and would provide a rich organic inventory that could be supplied to early planetary systems similar to that expected to have occurred in our own pre - solar nebula . with this in mind , we conducted high resolution observations of iras 16293 - 2422 using the nrao very large array ( vla ) using four molecular probes : ethyl cyanide ( ch@xmath0ch@xmath1cn ) , methyl formate ( ch@xmath0ocho ) , formic acid ( hcooh ) and the ground vibrational state of silicon monoxide ( sio ) to determine the implication of their relative spatial locations .",
    "surprisingly , the location of sio is not co - spatial with either core a or b. this prompted us to process archival bima array @xmath7co data for an explanation .",
    "observations of iras 16293 - 2422 were conducted with the vla in 2005 june 27 and 28 in its bnc configuration .",

    "these values are consistent to the column density of ch@xmath0ch@xmath1cn previously measured toward this source and is typical of the fractional abundance seen toward the orion compact ridge ( cazaux et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the figure 1 detection of extended emission with a spatial scale of @xmath220@xmath42 in a low - energy transition of ch@xmath0ch@xmath1cn demonstrates that there is a large envelope of cold molecular gas surrounding the compact binary cores a and b. core a is reputed to be hot ( chandler et al .",
    "2005 ) while core b is thought to be much cooler ( mundy et al .",
    "a warm gas phase chemistry or grain surface chemistry can lead to enhanced emission from nitrogen bearing molecules in hot molecular cores ( remijan et al .",
    "2004 ; mehringer & snyder 1996 ) . in previous observations of iras 16293 - 2422 which sample high energy level transitions at 1 and 3 mm , enhanced emission of nitrogen bearing molecules have been detected toward cores a and b ( e.g. , ch@xmath0cn by bottinelli et al .  2004 ; hcn , hc@xmath0n , and ch@xmath1chcn by kuan et al .",
    "2004 ) on a typical spatial scale of @xmath25@xmath3 .",
    "thus , our low - energy ch@xmath0ch@xmath1cn observations are complementary to these high - energy observations of other nitrogen bearing molecules , suggesting both increasing temperature and density gradients toward cores a and b.      high energy transition of a number of different molecules have emission centroids near core a ( e.g. , see figure 9 of chandler et al .",
    "2005 ) ; in particular , ch@xmath0ocho has high energy transitions that are associated with core a ( chandler et al .",

    "( 2005 ) toward core b is a low energy transition of dimethyl ether ( ch@xmath0och@xmath0 ) .",
    "figures 2 and 3 show maps of low - energy transitions of ch@xmath0ocho and hcooh , respectively , that are in proximity to core b. this is further evidence that core b is a much cooler protostellar core than core a. in figure 2 , the averaged emission from both the a and e states of ch@xmath0ocho are mapped using a synthesized beamwidth of @xmath22.@xmath36@xmath191.@xmath38 .",
    "figure 2 also shows an emission complex centered on the a and e states if one assumes an lsr velocity of @xmath2 + 3.9 km s@xmath17 .",
    "this complex appears to be suffering from the competing effects of emission and self - absorption . in order to observe both states in the same bandpass",
    ", the average frequency ( 45.3966 ghz ) of both states was used in the observations and this average frequency corresponds to an lsr velocity of + 3.9 km s@xmath17 in figure 2 while the a and e states appear at -1.6 and + 9.4 km s@xmath17 , respectively .",
    "figure 3 shows a map of the low - energy transition of hcooh that surrounds the peak of core b and also the ch@xmath0ocho emission in figure 2 ; no hcooh emission was detected in the vicinity of core a. in figure 3 , the emission from hcooh was mapped using a synthesized beamwidth of @xmath22.@xmath36@xmath191.@xmath38 ; similar to the beamwidth used to map the ch@xmath43ocho emission .",
    "the lsr velocity of hcooh is @xmath2 + 3.9 km s@xmath17 as indicated by the vertical dashed line in the spectrum also shown in figure 3 .",
    "the spatial distributions of ch@xmath0ocho and hcooh toward core b of iras 16293 - 2422 compare favorably to those same spatial distributions observed toward the orion molecular cloud ( omc-1 ) compact ridge ( hollis et al .",
    "2003 ; liu et al .",
    "for example , in the omc-1 compact ridge , hollis et al .",
    "( 2003 ) observed hcooh emission surrounding ch@xmath0ocho emission , and suggested that the hcooh emission delineates the leading edge of a shock front as the outflow from source `` i '' interacts with the quiescent ambient gas ; the ch@xmath0ocho emission , which is closer to source `` i '' , then represents the post shock gas .",
    "if this scenario is correct for iras 16293 - 2422 , then the corresponding outflow source associated with figures 2 and 3 is likely core b itself . indeed , chandler et al .",
    "( 2005 ) report evidence for material infall toward and also low - velocity outflow from core b ; both conditions undoubtedly result in shock phenomena . toward core",
    "a , enhanced abundances of large molecules provide indirect evidence for shocks to explain the enhancements ( chandler et al .",
    "2005 ) . the molecular differences between cores a and b",
    "are most likely explained by temperature differences and different protostellar ages . in any case , the presence of shocks seemingly leads to abundance enhancements in oxygen - bearing molecules , including large interstellar aldehydes located in high - mass star forming regions like sgr b2 ( e.g. , see hollis et al .",
    "2004a , b ) .    because the ch@xmath0ocho emission appears to be self - absorbed",
    ", we can only give a lower limit to the column density over the entire emission complex .",
    "since we have observed only low energy transitions in this work , a conservative rotational temperature of 40 k ( mundy et al .",
    "1986 ) is assumed which yields @xmath44(mef ) @xmath451.9@xmath1910@xmath46 @xmath38 .",
    "assuming an h@xmath1 column density of 1.6@xmath1910@xmath47 @xmath38 toward core b ( kuan et al .",
    "2004 ) , the ch@xmath0ocho fractional abundance is @xmath40(mef ) @xmath451.2@xmath1910@xmath48 .",
    "for the same rotational temperature , @xmath44(hcooh ) @xmath2 4.1@xmath1910@xmath49 @xmath38 and the hcooh fractional abundance is @xmath40(hcooh ) @xmath2 2.5@xmath1910@xmath41 ( see table 2 ) .      figure 4 shows redshifted and blueshifted sio ( @xmath20 , @xmath21=0 ) emission contours mapped separately over the 0.7 cm continuum ( grayscale ) .",
    "these two components of the sio emission are seen at lsr velocities of + 2.3 km s@xmath17 and + 7.9 km s@xmath17 which are approximately symmetrical around the systemic lsr velocity of 3.9 km s@xmath17 .",

    "ceccarelli et al .  ( 2000 ) concluded that an enhanced abundance of sio was necessary to account for the excess emission from the higher @xmath50 level transitions and that the emission must be coming from a compact ( @xmath223@xmath3 ) region .",
    "finally , their model calculated an infall velocity of sio of 2.8 km s@xmath17 which was consistent with their observed @xmath25 km s@xmath17 linewidths .    from our high resolution vla observations , we find that the blue and redshifted sio emission peaks have a spatial separation of @xmath22@xmath3 and the center of the sio emission centroid is located at @xmath11= 16@xmath1232@xmath1322@xmath14.875 , @xmath15 = -24@xmath428@xmath1632@xmath3.48 ( j2000.0 ) .",
    "this location is within 0.@xmath36 of the pointing position and location of the @xmath6co emission centroid taken with the owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) millimeter array ( mundy et al .",

    "the spectrum of the @xmath7co data clearly show an inverse p cygni profile with the strongest absorption in close proximity to the sio emission ( figure 5 ) , indicating unambiguously , material infalling toward the molecular disk .",
    "chandler et al .",
    "( 2005 ) also suggest there is evidence for infall toward core b from the absorption profile of so taken with the sma .",
    "it is important to note that we have only observed small - scale , blue - shifted emission and small - scale , red - shifted absorption of @xmath7co in the vicinity of cores a and b ( see the image in figure 5 ) ; these data possess the characteristic signature of infalling matter ( i.e. , an inverse p cygni profile shown in figure 5 ) .",
    "while the @xmath7co emission encompasses cores a and b , the more compact absorption occurs at a discrete position @xmath23.@xmath35 north of core a and @xmath22.@xmath35 west of core b ( see figure 4 ) . on the other hand",
    ", large - scale @xmath7co has been observed in red - shifted emission and blue - shifted emission by other investigators who reasonably interpret these results as outflow whose origin has traditionally been assigned to core a. thus , @xmath7co on two different spatial scales indicate two different phenomena : one of infall on a small - scale toward a newly detected protostellar accretion disk whose position is precisely determined and one of large - scale outflow whose exact origin may be difficult to determine .",
    "the location of the accretion disk that we have detected seems to account for our small - scale sio observations and the somewhat larger - scale @xmath6co observations of mundy et al .",
    "( 1986 ) and cs observations of menten et al .",
    "( 1987 ) only if the nearly edge - on disk is counter - rotating since the direction of rotation is opposite for sio when compared to either @xmath6co or cs .",
    "additional observational support for this scenario can be seen in the bima and ovro array images of schier et al .",
    "( 2005 ) who observed a number of low energy transitions ( i.e. , the j = 1 - 0 of hco@xmath52 , hnc , and n@xmath1h@xmath52 and the @xmath53 of c@xmath54o and sio ) . in these images , for example",
    ", the @xmath55 transition of sio suggests rotation in the opposite direction to the @xmath56 transition of hco@xmath52 .",
    "compared to the vla data presented in this work , these bima and ovro data have an order of magnitude coarser spatial resolution that precludes an exact determination of the sio emission locations that are apparent in the vla map shown in figure 4 .",
    "furthermore , sio is a refractory molecule that can withstand high temperatures , and would likely exist closer to a forming protostellar source than most other molecules .",
    "thus , the high resolution vla observations have shown for the first time , evidence for a new protostellar core with a compact inner portion of the disk containing the sio emission counter - rotating with respect to the outer portion of the disk containing @xmath6co and cs .",
    "counter - rotating cores have been reported in disks of galaxies before ( e.g. , thomas et al .",
    "2005 and references therein ) , but this is the first indication of such behavior in a protostellar accretion disk .",
    "to summarize , we find a low temperature envelope of molecular ch@xmath0ch@xmath1cn emission that is encompassing the iras 16293 - 2422 cores a and b. furthermore , low frequency , low energy transitions of large oxygen bearing molecules ( i.e. hcooh and ch@xmath0ocho ) are seen toward core b where an outflow may be responsible for a low velocity shock that is leading to enhanced abundances of large oxygen bearing species . also , the sio emission shows two velocity components with spatial scales less than 2@xmath3 and a velocity separation of @xmath25.6 km s@xmath17 .",
    "we interpret the spatial position offset in red and blueshifted sio emission as due to the rotation of a protostellar accretion disk and we derive @xmath21.4 m@xmath5 interior to the sio emission .    while it could be that the sio complex we observe is due to outflow , evidence is accumulating to the contrary that rotation is the explanation .",
    "such evidence is best seen on a small scale .",
    "the sio observations in the present work show two velocity components each with linewidths of @xmath25 km s@xmath17 , suggesting rotation of a disk seen edge - on since the two components are not cospatial , are symmetric about an infall location , and have a velocity gradient perpendicular to large - scale co outflow .",
    "moreover , images of other molecules on a small - scale also show that their velocity gradients are orthogonal to the direction of outflow seen on a large scale ( e.g. , schier et al .",
    "2005 ) . in this work",
    ", we have been very careful to match the synthesized beam to the source emission or absorption to pin - point the location of a new source of infall @xmath23.@xmath35 north of core source a and @xmath22.@xmath35 west of core source b. we have done this by two independent sets of observations ( i.e. , the vla in sio emission and the bima array in @xmath7co absorption ) . while there are no previous reports of continuum emission at this location , an inverse p cygni profile is absolute proof of absorption against background continuum , and our bima data show that the location is smaller than the synthesized beam ( i.e. , 3.2@xmath3@xmath190.8@xmath3 ) .",
    "thus , the continuum source is undoubtedly small ( e.g. a disk seen edge - on ) and may eventually be detected by an interferometer at high resolution with enough integration time .    however , the compact disk containing the sio emission is _ counter - rotating _ with respect to the @xmath6co and cs emission seen by other investigators .",
    "this is the first report of evidence for a counter - rotating accretion disk toward a low - mass protostellar complex .",
    "moreover , archival bima array @xmath7co data show an inverse p cygni profile with the strongest absorption in close proximity to the sio emission , indicating unambiguously , material infalling toward the counter - rotating protostellar disk .",
