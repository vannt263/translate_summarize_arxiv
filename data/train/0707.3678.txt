    "this paper describes the background for topological quantum computing in terms of temperely ",
    "lieb recoupling theory and gives an explicit description of the resulting unitary representations of the artin braid group , including the fibonacci model as the simplest case .",
    "we use a recoupling theory that generalizes standard angular momentum recoupling theory , generalizes the penrose theory of spin networks and is inherently topological .",
    "lieb recoupling theory is based on the bracket polynomial model for the jones polynomial .",
    "it is built in terms of diagrammatic combinatorial topology .",
    "the same structure can be explained in terms of the @xmath1 quantum group , and has relationships with functional integration and witten s approach to topological quantum field theory .",
    "nevertheless , the approach given here will be unrelentingly elementary .",
    "elementary , does not necessarily mean simple . in this case an architecture is built from simple beginnings and this archictecture and its recoupling language can be applied to many things including : colored jones polynomials , witten  reshetikhin  turaev invariants of three manifolds , topological quantum field theory and quantum computing .",
    "the contents of this paper are based upon the work in @xcite and we shall refer to results from that paper .    in quantum computing ,",
    "the application is most interesting because the recoupling theory yields representations of the artin braid group into unitary groups @xmath2 .",
    "these represententations are _ dense _ in the unitary group , and can be used to model quantum computation universally in terms of representations of the braid group .",
    "hence the term : topological quantum computation .    in this paper",
    ", we outline the basics of the temperely ",
    "lieb recoupling theory , and show explicitly how unitary representations of the braid group arise from it .",
    "we will return to this subject in more detail in subsequent papers .",
    "in particular , we do not describe the context of anyonic models for quantum computation in this paper .",
    "rather , we concentrate here on showing how naturally unitary representations of the braid group arise in the context of the temperely  lieb theory . for the reader interested in the relevant background in anyonic topological quantum computing",
    "we recommend the following references \\ { @xcite } .",
    "here is a very condensed presentation of how unitary representations of the braid group are constructed via topological quantum field theoretic methods . for simplicity assmue",
    "that one has a single ( mathematical ) particle with label @xmath3 that can interact with itself to produce either itself labeled @xmath4 or itself with the null label @xmath5 when @xmath6 interacts with @xmath3 the result is always @xmath7 when @xmath6 interacts with @xmath6 the result is always @xmath5 one considers process spaces where a row of particles labeled @xmath3 can successively interact , subject to the restriction that the end result is @xmath8 for example the space @xmath9 $ ] denotes the space of interactions of three particles labeled @xmath8 the particles are placed in the positions @xmath10 thus we begin with @xmath11 in a typical sequence of interactions , the first two @xmath3 s interact to produce a @xmath12 and the @xmath6 interacts with @xmath3 to produce @xmath8 @xmath13 in another possibility , the first two @xmath3 s interact to produce a @xmath14 and the @xmath3 interacts with @xmath3 to produce @xmath8 @xmath15 it follows from this analysis that the space of linear combinations of processes @xmath9 $ ] is two dimensional .",
    "the two processes we have just described can be taken to be the the qubit basis for this space .",
    "one obtains a representation of the three strand artin braid group on @xmath9 $ ] by assigning appropriate phase changes to each of the generating processes .",
    "one can think of these phases as corresponding to the interchange of the particles labeled @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the association @xmath18 the other operator for this representation corresponds to the interchange of @xmath17 and @xmath19 this interchange is accomplished by a _",
    "unitary change of basis mapping",
    "_ @xmath20 \\longrightarrow v[a(bc)].\\ ] ] if @xmath21 \\longrightarrow v[(ba)c : d]\\ ] ] is the first braiding operator ( corresponding to an interchange of the first two particles in the association ) then the second operator @xmath22 \\longrightarrow v[(ac)b]\\ ] ] is accomplished via the formula @xmath23 where the @xmath24 in this formula acts in the second vector space @xmath25 $ ] to apply the phases for the interchange of @xmath17 and @xmath19    in this scheme , vector spaces corresponding to associated strings of particle interactions are interrelated by _ recoupling transformations _ that generalize the mapping @xmath26 indicated above .",
    "a full representation of the artin braid group on each space is defined in terms of the local intechange phase gates and the recoupling transfomations .",
    "these gates and transformations have to satisfy a number of identities in order to produce a well - defined representation of the braid group .",
    "these identities were discovered originally in relation to topological quantum field theory . in our approach",
    "the structure of phase gates and recoupling transformations arise naturally from the structure of the bracket model for the jones polynomial @xcite .",
    "thus we obtain a knot - theoretic basis for topological quantum computing .",
    "in this section we discuss a combinatorial construction for spin networks that generalizes the original construction of roger penrose @xcite .",
    "the result of this generalization is a structure that satisfies all the properties of a graphical @xmath27 as described in our paper on braiding and universal quantum gates @xcite , and specializes to classical angular momentum recoupling theory in the limit of its basic variable .",
    "the construction is based on the properties of the bracket polynomial @xcite .",

    "@xmath3 can interact with itself to produce either @xmath3 or @xmath12 while @xmath6 acts as an identity element .",
    "that is , @xmath6 interacts with @xmath3 to produce only @xmath4 and @xmath6 interacts with @xmath6 to produce @xmath5 let @xmath28 = v[a_{1}a_{2 } \\cdots a_{n}:a_{n+1 } ] = v(p p p \\cdots p : p).\\ ] ] the space @xmath29 $ ] has basis vectors @xmath30 where @xmath31 runs over all sequences of @xmath3 s and @xmath6 s without consecutive @xmath6 s .",
