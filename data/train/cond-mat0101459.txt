    "in recent years , experiments have shown that optical excitation of electron - hole pairs in semiconductors by ultrafast lasers can coherently excite longitudinal optical phonon modes in semiconductors .",

    "coupling of the photoexcited carriers to the phonons leads only to coherent optical phonon modes with @xmath2 .",
    "since the frequency of the @xmath2 acoustic phonon is zero , coherent acoustic phonons are not excited in bulk semiconductors .    in semiconductor superlattices ,",
    "even though the laser pump has a wavelength large compared to the lattice spacing , the pump can preferentially generate electron - hole pairs in the wells .",
    "the result is to create photoexcited carrier distributions that have the periodicity of the superlattice .",
    "since the density matrix of the photo - excited carrier populations now has a @xmath3 fourier component , the photo - excited carriers can not only couple to the optical phonon modes , but they can also generate coherent acoustic phonon modes with a nonzero frequency and wavevector @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the superlattice period . in superlattices ,",

    "since acoustic phonons are almost the same in the well as in the barrier , to lowest order we can treat the string as being uniform @xcite . the forcing term on the string , however , is not uniform since photoexcitation of carriers occurs only in the wells .",

    "<S> a microscopic theory for the generation and propagation of coherent la phonons in pseudomorphically strained wurtzite ( 0001 ) @xmath0 multi - quantum well ( mqw ) @xmath1 diodes is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the generation of coherent la phonons is driven by photoexcitation of electron - hole pairs by an ultrafast gaussian pump laser and is treated theoretically using the density matrix formalism . </S>",
    "<S> we use realistic wurtzite bandstructures taking valence - band mixing and strain - induced piezoelectric fields into account . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the many - body coulomb interaction is treated in the screened time - dependent hartree - fock approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we find that under typical experimental conditions , our microscopic theory can be simplified and mapped onto a loaded string problem which can be easily solved . </S>"
