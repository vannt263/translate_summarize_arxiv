    "many experimental results confirm the possibility of shear banding , i.e. the separation of bands of different shear rates and apparent viscosities in the flow of various systems of wormlike micelles ( aqueous solutions of surfactants and salt @xcite or organic solvent solutions of metallic complexes @xcite ) , or lyotropic liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "this type of behaviour can be explained as being the result of a constitutive instability , suitably described by non - monotonic flow curves such as those arising from the johnson - segalman ( js ) @xcite or doi - edwards models @xcite .",
    "it is possible that similar constitutive instabilities are responsible for spurt and extrudate distortions of polymer melts @xcite .",
    "the steady banded flow solutions of the js model were previously studied in planar @xcite , poiseuille @xcite , and cylindrical couette geometries @xcite . in all these geometries banded flow solutions have continuous degeneracy @xcite , resulting from the indeterminacy of the positions of the interfaces and of the number of bands .",
    "the stress value can be kinetically selected @xcite , and it may differ from the top jump prediction of refs .",
    "@xcite , although the selected value depends on the flow history and on the imposed shear rate @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to experiments on wormlike micelles that show a well defined stress plateau in the flow curves : the total stress is history independent and do not change with the shear rate .",
    "furthermore , the evolution of the stress during transient flow may be rather long , suggesting the slow migration of the interface between bands to an equilibrium position @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite we showed that , by supplementing the js model with a stress diffusion term , one can lift the degeneracy of the steady flow and also account for the slow migration of the interface .",
    "the origin of this diffusion term can be justified in terms of the brownian movement of polymer chains in an inhomogeneous stress field and can be deduced from the fokker - planck equation for a system of dumbbells @xcite .",
    "there is no calculation , at present , for such a term in the wormlike micelle system .",
    "similar results have been obtained by refs .",
    "@xcite by introducing phenomenological diffusion terms in toy constitutive models .",
    "although non - local terms are not important in homogeneous flow , in banded flow a realistic description of interfaces as strongly inhomogeneous regions requires such terms .",
    "this necessity has been noted by many authors @xcite .",
    "recent experiments @xcite on wormlike micelles in pipe ( poiseuille ) and cylindrical couette flow geometries , or in cone and plate @xcite using nmr microscopy found shear rate profiles with two or three bands .",
    "birefringence measurements in couette geometry @xcite suggest the existence of only two bands , although the relation between birefringence and shear rate is hard to establish because it depends on microstructure .",
    "most experiments on shear banding are performed in geometries imposing inhomogeneous total stress ( couette , pipe flow , cone and plate ) .",
    "typically a stress quantity ( _ e.g. _ torque , or pressure drop , or shear stress ) is measured as a function of a rate of flow quantity ( _ e.g. _ mean strain rate , flux through a pipe , wall speed ) , and an engineering `` flow curve '' is constructed . under inhomogeneous flow conditions the flow curves are not simply the local constitutive relation of the fluid .",
    "it is therefore important to assess theoretically the question of how many bands can occur and which are the flow curves for a given constitutive model and in various geometries .",
    "we present elsewhere numerical computations of flow curves in couette flow @xcite for the js - d model . here",
    "we show how matched asymptotics techniques can be used to obtain analytic results on the number of bands , interface width , and flow curves in various geometries .",
    "the application of these techniques to the js - d model represents only an example , and the same method can be easily adapted to other constitutive models .    the structure of the paper is the following . in section",
    "[ sec : model ] we introduce the flow equations in various geometries .",
    "the matched asymptotic solutions of these equations are presented in section [ sect : matched ] . in section [ sect : uniqueness ] we discuss how the inner layer solution controls the history independence and stability of the flow .",
    "we apply our results in section [ sect : applications ] to predict the shapes of flow curves and the interface width . in section",
    "[ sect : conclusions ] we discuss the results and suggest possible extensions .",
    "the dynamics of the diffusive johnson - segalman fluid is described by two equations .",
    "the first is the momentum balance : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the fluid density , @xmath2 is the velocity field , and @xmath3 is the total stress tensor where the pressure @xmath4 is determined by incompressibility , @xmath5 is the viscoelastic stress carried by the polymer strands , @xmath6 is the `` solvent viscosity '' and @xmath7 is the symmetric part of the velocity gradient . the second equation is a constitutive relation for the polymer stress @xmath8 , which we take to be the the js constitutive model @xcite with an added diffusion term @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the `` polymer '' viscosity , @xmath11 is the relaxation time , and @xmath12 is the diffusion coefficient .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath8 is governed by the gordon - schowalter ( gs ) time derivative @xcite , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the `` slip parameter '' and @xmath15 is the antisymmetric part of the velocity gradient . for @xmath16 there is no slip and the gs derivative becomes the upper convective derivative . for @xmath17 ( total slip ) the fluid stress is not transmitted to the polymer strands and these can only be oriented by the flow : the gs derivative becomes the corotational derivative . in this work",

    "the introduction of a non - local diffusion term in the js local constitutive relation lifts the continuous degeneracy and the history dependence of the steady flow solution for poiseuille and cylindrical couette geometries , and generally for any geometry that imposes a non - uniform total shear stress . in order to analyse these phenomena we used matched asymptotic techniques which are common in the field of reaction - diffusion systems describing processes like combustion or nerve conduction , but which , to our knowledge , are new in the field of creeping flow of complex fluids .",
    "the use of the js model in this paper should be considered only as an example of application of these methods in order to investigate the consequences of diffusion terms on banded flow .",

    "another possibility , not taken into account here but that needs further investigation , is that concentration effects may stabilise banded flows with more than two bands .",
    "thus , a depletion layer at the inner cylinder increases locally the selected stress and may equilibrate a second interface closer to the inner cylinder than the first equilibrium position which corresponds to higher concentration and lower selected stress .    in the absence of diffusion",

    "the same arbitrariness of the number of bands was shown in steady poiseuille flow @xcite . in numerical simulations of ref .  @xcite no selection was noticed , except for the one imposed by the mesh size .",
    "recently , we showed numerically @xcite that even in couette flow , solving the flow in the absence of diffusion is an ill - posed problem , unstable to noise in the initial conditions .",
    "the lack of robustness of the flow increases when the curvature decreases , in the sense that larger and larger regions inside the gap may split into multiple bands under perturbations of the initial conditions .",
    "@xcite found an unique , single interface solution even in the planar shear of the js model without a diffusion term , although this interface has a finite width that suggests diffusion terms intrinsic to the finite element scheme . with diffusion",
    "the system of dynamical equations becomes parabolic leading to compactness of the global attractors and to stability with respect to initial conditions @xcite .    in certain conditions in cylindrical couette flow ( low curvature and high polymer viscosity ) ,",
    "both normal and inverted band sequences are allowed for the same shear rate .",
    "nevertheless , the inverted band is metastable and can be reached from rest only on the second half of the plateau @xcite . although this branch has not been observed experimentally ,",
    "its existence and linear stability is proven rigorously and may have consequences on the kinetics of shear - banding within a restricted domain of control parameters .",
    "an interesting feature shown by experimental flow curves and reproduced by our theoretical model is the presence of a selected stress plateau , reminiscent of isotherms at liquid - gas or decompositions of binary systems first order phase transitions . in thermodynamic transitions",
    "the plateau is fixed by a maxwell type construction , justified by the equality of the chemical potentials of the coexisting phases . in the model",
    "we present here the equilibrium of `` phases '' is a condition of existence of a stationary interface , and relies on the balance between stress diffusion across the interface and non - linear stress relaxation .",
    "the retardation parameter plays the rle of temperature , and its critical value @xmath213 is analogous to an equilibrium critical point .",
