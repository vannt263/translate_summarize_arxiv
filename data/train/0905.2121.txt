    "star clusters in the local group galaxies are partially resolved into individual stars in the images obtained with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) so that they play an important role in the study of extragalactic star clusters .",
    "there have been numerous studies that estimated the ages of star clusters in the local group galaxies with the photometry of resolved stars in star clusters : for example , lmc ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) and smc @xcite , ngc 185 , ngc 205 @xcite , m31 @xcite , and m33 @xcite .",
    "m33 ( ngc 598 ) , triangulum galaxy , is a late - spiral galaxy ( scd ) , and is one of the three spiral galaxies in the local group .",
    "it is known to have numerous star clusters ( see @xcite and references therein . ) .",
    "it is located at about 900 kpc from us @xcite and has a large number of star clusters so that it offers us an excellent opportunity to study the ages of resolved star clusters . at the distance of m33",
    ", bright star clusters are easily resolved into stars and even the faint star clusters can be seen with a hint of resolved stars on the images taken with hst / wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) .",
    "there were several studies on the ages of star clusters in m33 .",
    "@xcite estimated the ages of m33 star clusters in the catalog of @xcite by comparing the integrated photometry of the star clusters with a simple stellar population ( ssp ) model in the color - color diagram .",
    "later @xcite supplemented their age estimates for more m33 star clusters with the spectroscopic data .",
    "they found that the age distribution of star clusters in the halo of m33 shows a large age spread , and little progression of abundance with age .",
    "they pointed out these properties are consistent with accretion origin for a large fraction of m33 halo but not with monolithic collapse scenario of the halo . from the comparison of globular cluster properties in nearby dwarf galaxies , they claimed m33 halo cluster population might have formed by accretion of lower luminosity dwarf irregular galaxies and dwarf spheroidals rather the ones such as magellanic clouds . the apparent lack of metallicity gradient among the ten m33 halo cluster samples of @xcite also further supported the accretion scenario .",
    "@xcite estimated the ages and metallicity of the m33 star clusters in their series of papers @xcite .",
    "they obtained the integrated spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of star clusters from the photometry using the beijing - arizona - taipei - connecticut ( batc ) system with 13 narrow band filters .",
    "they fitted the seds with the ssp model to simultaneously determine the age and metallicity of star clusters .",
    "they showed that their age estimations for star cluster samples from @xcite are consistent with previous estimates . using the age estimates of m33 clusters given by @xcite",
    ", @xcite showed that the number of clusters in the age distribution appears to decline with age with no obvious breaks or abrupt changes , being fit well by a single power law .",
    "@xcite estimated ages of ten resolved globular clusters in m33 using the isochrone fitting technique to the deep cmds of resolved stars derived from the hst / wfpc2 images .",
    "they estimated the metallicity from the slope of red giant branch , and found that m33 star clusters show a significant second parameter effect .",
    "they concluded from this result that these star clusters might be several gyrs younger than the galactic globular clusters if the second parameter is the age .",
    "@xcite estimated the age of a globular cluster , c38 in the list of @xcite , to be @xmath42 - 5 gyrs old , utilizing the integrated spectrum and the resolved member star cmd .",
    "@xcite found 24 star clusters from the deep images of two hst / advanced camera for survey ( acs ) fields in m33 , and derived ages for 20 of them by fitting theoretical isochrones to the features on the cmds of resolved stars including the main - sequence turnoffs ( msto ) .",
    "the derived ages of the star clusters range from @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "recently @xcite derived an age of @xmath7 gyr , for one extended cluster at the outer edge of m33 , using the cmd of the resolved stars .",
    "@xcite also estimated ages of four m33 star clusters by fitting isochrones to the member star cmd derived from hst / acs images .",
    "@xcite compiled a comprehensive catalog of 242 star clusters in m33 identified from the hst image data .",
    "along with 32 new star clusters detected from 24 hst / wfpc2 fields , they combined several previous m33 star catalogs @xcite obtained with hst data only , thus to ensure that the resulting master catalog contains only the confirmed star clusters .",
    "this catalog offers a good sample of star clusters for age studies .",
    "as part of our project on studying star clusters in m33 , we derived photometry of the resolved stars in and around the star clusters from the hst / wfpc2 images that contain m33 star clusters listed in @xcite .",

    "note @xcite compiled all published lists of m33 star clusters to build a comprehensive catalog which is being maintained on - line ] . for reference , we included their catalog ids with sm designation .",
    "we used hst / wfpc2 images of m33 fields available in the hst archive .",
    "these hst / wfpc2 image sets include the 20 fields listed in table  1 of @xcite , 35 fields listed in table  1 of @xcite , and 24 fields listed in table  1 in @xcite .",
    "we derived the magnitudes of the point sources in the images using hstphot @xcite that is designed for the point spread function ( psf ) fitting photometry of point sources in the wfpc2 images .",
    "hstphot uses a library of tinytim psf for psf fitting .",
    "individual images were all coadded with utility program included in hstphot .",
    "hstphot produces instrumental magnitudes as well as standard magnitudes calibrated with @xcite s relation and zeropoints from @xcite after it automatically applies the correction for charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) @xcite .",
    "since hstphot only calibrates the instrumental magnitudes of widely used filters , we used only the images obtained with @xmath8(b ) , @xmath9(v ) , @xmath10(v ) , and @xmath11(i ) .",
    "the resultant photometry data turn out to have small photometric error .",
    "[ magerr ] shows that resultant data have photometric errors smaller than @xmath12 at @xmath13 mag even for about 200 sec long image , and as for the data from exposures longer than 1000 sec , the errors get larger than @xmath14 only for @xmath15 .",
    "apparent sizes of the star clusters in the images are @xmath16 in most cases , and as large as @xmath17 for some cases with long exposures .",
    "we construct the cmds of resolved stars in cluster - centric radii from @xmath18 to @xmath19 varying on the sizes of the clusters , which are listed in the fifth column of table  [ cluster_age ] . to minimize the field star contamination , the cmds of field stars were compared with those of member stars around each star cluster .",
    "field stars were selected in the annulus of which the inner radius is @xmath17 and of the same area as the member star selection circle .",
    "since hst / wfpc2 data used in this study were obtained from various observational projects , the depths of the images are not homogeneous .",
    "thus , it happened that a star cluster observed on more than one field in our image sets resulted in different individual star detection on each appearance .",
    "in such a case , we used the cmd that has the largest number of detected stars for the analysis .",
    "[ starcmd ] displays the cmds of resolved stars in 100 star clusters thus derived .",
    "some cmds include only a few resolved stars .",
    "nevertheless they show features that can be used for age estimation such as bright ms in young star clusters .",
    "the most reliable age determination of star cluster can be made with the location of the msto .",
    "we regarded the position of the brightest ms star as msto for young star clusters .",
    "however , even the deepest image set among these could not reveal the positions of the msto for old star clusters . in those cases",
    ", we had to rely on the rgb feature which is not sensitive to the age .",
    "therefore , we estimated only the lower age limits of the star clusters by fitting the isochrones to the observed part of the rgb .",
    "we used the theoretical isochrones in the padova models @xcite to estimate the age of each star cluster .",
    "@xcite reported that metallicities of their 60 star clusters span a large range from @xmath20 to @xmath21 , and that their young cluster samples can be well represented by the @xmath22 model , while there is a distinct turnoff to lower metallicity(@xmath23 ) around @xmath24 .",
    "accordingly , we used the model for @xmath22 for star clusters that turned out to have mainly blue or intermediate color stars and few red stars .",
    "as for the old star clusters whose detected members are mainly rgb stars , we used either model of @xmath22 or @xmath23 , whichever metallicity could fit the rgb better .",
    "we used the reddening values given in the @xcite for isochrone fitting for each star cluster .",
    "we adopted as the distance to m33 , 910 kpc ( @xmath25 ) given by @xcite .",
    "note there is a good summary of recent estimates of the distance to m33 obtained in various ways given by @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated the distance to m33 using the @xmath26-band magnitude of the tip of red giant branch ( trgb ) of field stars @xcite . during this study",
    ", we visually checked that the @xmath26-band magnitude of trgb for m33 field stars in our images is indeed close to their estimation .",
    "therefore we adopted their result as the distance to m33 .",
    "isochrones were fitted visually , and the upper and lower age limits of a star cluster were also estimated visually .",

    "the age distribution of star clusters in this study shows a broad distribution with a peak at @xmath0 , and a small number of star clusters older than @xmath2 .",
    "the broad component can be fit well with a gaussian with the peak age at @xmath27 and the width of @xmath28 .",
    "thus a majority of the clusters in this study are young to intermediate - age and a small number of the clusters are older than about one gyr .",
    "it is noted that there is only one star cluster younger than @xmath29 in the our sample , while the ma sample shows a large component of young clusters with a peak at @xmath30 and the chandar sample shows a small component of young clusters with a peak at @xmath31 .",
    "due to the different depths of hst / wfpc2 images used in this study , it is not easy to estimate the completeness of the age sample .",
    "however , we note that the isochrone fitting method used in this study has a bias such that bright , large sparse star clusters are likely to be included more than faint compact ones in the final age sample .      fig .",

    "in general , the age and integrated magnitude / color show consistent behaviors on the cmd .",

    "therefore , these old star clusters can be regarded as being analogous to the mwgcs .",
    "one notable star cluster is cluster i d 85 (= mkkss-27 , sm-261 ) , with @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",

    "@xcite estimated its age to be @xmath39 from integrated photometry , or 2 - 5 gyrs from spectroscopy .",
    "we obtained psf photometry of ten stars around this star cluster . summing the magnitudes of these ten stars , we derive the total magnitude and color @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "these values are very similar to those from aperture photometry , @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "therefore we regarded psf photometry recovered most of bright member stars in this cluster .",
    "the hst / wfpc2 images of the field including this cluster and the cmd of this cluster show that there are two very bright red stars .",
    "the spatial locations of these red stars in the cluster indicate that they are probably member stars , and their locations on the cmd show that they are red supergiant stars .",
    "the fluxes of these stars contribute to most of the integrated light of the star cluster .",
    "if we remove the light contribution of these two red supergiant stars , we get the integrated photometry of @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "this shows that this cluster is much younger than the age derived from the case including the two stars .",
    "we estimated the age of this star cluster to be @xmath46 , which is much younger than previous estimations .",
    "this case clearly shows the power of age estimation with resolved star cmd over those based on integrated light .",
    "intermediate - age star clusters ( @xmath47 ) occupy the intermediate color region in the cmd .",
    "it is interesting to note that their integrated magnitude range is quite fainter than those of younger star clusters or of older red star clusters . on the other hand ,",
    "star clusters younger than @xmath48 have bright young stars whose fluxes contribute the majority of total star cluster light .",
    "these stars are bright main sequence stars or supergiants .",
    "consequently , young star clusters are located in the bright , blue regions on integrated cmd .    since the ages in this study were derived in an independent way from using the integrated color of the star clusters , more insight to star cluster properties",
    "can be obtained by comparing the ages and the integrated colors of the star clusters .",
    "[ agecolor ] displays the integrated color versus age diagram .",
    "we plotted also the theoretical relations derived from single stellar population models of @xcite , for @xmath49 , 0.004 and 0.0004 .",
    "the figure shows that the integrated colors of the m33 clusters increase slowly as the age increases , approximately consistent with the theoretical curves . @xmath50 and @xmath51",
    "colors of the young clusters show a large scatter for young star clusters , while their @xmath52 colors show a small scatter around the theoretical curves .",
    "it is suspected that this may be due to the large uncertainty in the @xmath26-band photometry of the clusters .",
    "it is needed to obtain better integrated photometry in the @xmath26-band .      with 100 star cluster samples of known ages in hand , we investigated their radial distribution around m33 .",
    "with consideration of their integrated @xmath53 colors and the age distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ agedist ] , we divided the star clusters into three age groups : ( 1 ) young star clusters with @xmath54 , ( 2 ) intermediate - age star clusters with @xmath47 , and ( 3 ) old star clusters with @xmath55 .",

    "only young star clusters are found in the region close to the m33 center , whereas only intermediate - age and old star clusters are found in the outside region .",
    "this is consistent with the finding by @xcite who used the age estimates derived from integrated photometry .",

    "there are some undetected stars in cluster i d 170 ( sm-220 ) , but they look like faint stars . except for above three star clusters , it seems that hstphot detected all bright stars in the region of each star cluster .",

    "it is difficult to derive reliable ages for these clusters just with rgb features .",
    "but for other star clusters , we noted that there are some blue stars whose colors ( @xmath50 or @xmath52 ) are @xmath69 , with their magnitude errors smaller than 0.2 .",
    "most of these stars are located in the very central region of the star clusters .",
    "therefore , we regard these as blue main sequence member stars . if they are indeed the member stars of the cluster , @xcite might have overestimated the ages of these star clusters .",

    "we note they obtained @xmath52 colors to be bluer than @xcite for the same clusters @xcite .",
    "it seems that large seeing condition ( @xmath81 ) and large aperture ( @xmath82 ) used in their photometry caused light contamination from neighboring blue disk stars in m33 , thus leading to younger age estimation even compared with those of @xcite .",

    "this is true to both integrated photometry or psf photometry of resolved stars .",
    "however , the effect of non member star selection can be reduced in resolved star photometry since the contribution of individual stars can be evaluated .",
    "for example , cmd of stars near star cluster center , and those of control field are compared to minimize the field star contamination .",
    "although psf photometry could not detect some bright stars in the cluster region , we argue that our age estimations for star clusters based on the isochrone fitting are more accurate than other age estimations based on the integrated light of the star clusters .",
    "the resultant age distribution shows that there is only one star cluster which is younger than @xmath83 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ agedist](a ) .",
    "it might be that there are indeed few young star clusters in m33 .",

    "therefore it is unlikely that m33 lacks very young star clusters .",
    "in fact , the presence of very young clusters that are 35 myrs old was reported in ngc 604 @xcite .",
    "such young clusters normally are embedded in nebulous environments , which makes it difficult to be detected with visual investigation .      the interaction between galaxies",
    "is known to often trigger the formation of stars and star clusters .",

    ", the spatial distribution of halo stars shows no sign of disturbance @xcite .",

    "there are ten old star clusters with lower age limits of @xmath2 in our sample .",
    "while we can not estimate their exact ages with out data , previous studies on some of these clusters suggested that they are several gyrs younger than galactic globular clusters ( see @xcite ) .",
    "if the peak for the age distribution of these old star clusters are found to be similar to the epoch of the interaction , it might be possible that the galaxy interaction with m31 had triggered the formation of old star clusters in m33 .",
