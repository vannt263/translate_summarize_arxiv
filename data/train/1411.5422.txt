    "the sine - gordon field theory and the associated massive thirring model @xcite are some of the best studied quantum field theories . in view of its connections to other important physical models ,",
    "some of which in principle admit actual realizations in nature @xcite , a huge mass of important exact results have been obtained for this fascinating integrable system @xcite . however , no less fascinating are the remarkable mathematical and physical properties of its soliton ( or  solitary wave \" ) solutions which have contributed , along the last decades , to turn the physics of solitons into a very active research topic .    in this work we present a simple and yet appealing step - by - step derivation of a more general solution for the classical sine - gordon field theory in ( 1 + 1)-dimensions in terms of a special kind of elliptic function , namely the jacobi amplitude , which has the famous sine - gordon soliton solution as a particular case . despite the fact that the connection between solitons and jacobi elliptic functions has already been explored in @xcite",
    ", we believe this work comes to shed more light on this interesting subject , helping to fill in a gap existing in the corresponding specialized literature .",
    "we start by considering the following theory describing a real scalar field in ( 1 + 1)-dimensions ( @xmath1 ) , @xmath2 where the potential term is given by @xmath3 the above lagrangian gives rise , through the euler - lagrange equation , @xmath4 , to the following field equation @xmath5 notice that since equation ( [ eq3 ] ) is invariant under lorentz transformations ( @xmath6)@xcite , its solutions may be obtained through the solutions of the corresponding equation for the static case ( @xmath7 ) by a simple lorentz boost , namely @xmath8 , for arbitrary @xmath9 ( @xmath10)@xcite . thus , in what follows , we will focus on the solutions of the equation @xmath11 indeed , by multiplying the above equation by @xmath12 we obtain @xmath13 = \\frac{d v}{dx } , \\label{eq5}\\ ] ] which , after an integration with respect to @xmath14 and some algebra , may be rewritten as @xmath15 by integrating both sides of the above equation , from @xmath16 to @xmath17 ( @xmath18 to @xmath19 ) , we get @xmath20 in order to compute the above integral , we must firstly notice that the potential , shown in equation ( [ eq2 ] ) , may be rewritten as @xmath21 .",
    "\\label{eq8}\\ ] ] thus , by making the change of variables @xmath22 , defining @xmath23 and choosing @xmath24 such that @xmath25 , we are left with @xmath26 the integral appearing in equation ( [ eq9 ] ) is called an incomplete elliptic integral of the first kind , @xmath27 , whereas @xmath28 is called the elliptic modulus or eccentricity .",
    "the upper limit , @xmath29 , of this integral may be written in terms of the _ jacobi amplitude _ ( the inverse function of the incomplete elliptic integral of the first kind ) as @xcite .",
    "@xmath30 notice that , from the above definition , we have @xmath31 .",
    "the solution of equation ( [ eq4 ] ) may be , finally , written as @xmath32 hence , from the above equation , we may notice that @xmath33 as it should .      from the definition @xmath35 we may obviously see that when @xmath36 we have @xmath37 .",
    "hence , the solution for equation ( [ eq4 ] ) with the potential given by @xmath38 , \\label{eq13}\\ ] ] may be obtained as a special case of the solution presented in equation ( [ eq11 ] ) . indeed , since @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is called the _",
    "gudermannian function _",
    "( a special function which relates the circular functions to the hyperbolic ones without using complex numbers , named after christoph gudermann ( 1798 - 1852 ) ) , we are left with @xmath41 \\mp \\frac{\\pi}{\\beta}. \\label{eq14}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] last but not least , we must notice that by substituting the equation ( [ eq14 ] ) into equation ( [ eq3 ] ) and making the change ( lorentz boost ) @xmath8 , we obtain the famous sine - gordon field equation , namely @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the no less famous soliton / anti - soliton solution @xcite , given by @xmath44 .",
    "\\label{eq16}\\ ] ] this result allows us to characterize the lorentz boosted , and shifted by @xmath45 , version of the solution in terms of the jacobi amplitude shown in equation ( [ eq11 ] ) , namely @xmath46 as a generalization of the sine - gordon soliton / anti - soliton solution for @xmath47 .",
    "we would like to make a few comments about the soliton solution , shown in equation ( [ eq16 ] ) , and its generalized version , shown in equation ( [ eq17 ] ) .",
    "firstly , we may notice by comparing the figures [ figure1 ] and [ figure2 ] how different are these solutions , where we would like to highlight the doubly periodic behaviour of the jacobi amplitude solution .",
    "[ h ]    [ h ]    finally , let us observe that , as remarked in @xcite , this soliton solution , though arising in a classical field theory , looks very much like a classical particle since its energy density is localized at a point ( @xmath48 ) and its total energy for a static field configuration ( @xmath49 ) , namely @xmath50=\\frac{8\\sqrt{2\\alpha}}{\\beta } , \\label{eq18}\\ ] ] is finite , just as we should expect .",
