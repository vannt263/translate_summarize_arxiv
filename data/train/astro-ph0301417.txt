    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are widely believed to be powered by accretion onto super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) .",
    "recent observational studies of galaxies have revealed that substantial numbers of galaxies do contain smbhs in their nuclei ( e.g. , kormendy , richstone 1995 ; ho 1999 ; @xcite ) ; smbhs are also found even in quiescent galaxies , such as the milky way ( e.g. , eckart , genzel 1996 ) .",
    "these facts prompt us to argue that many ( or most ) quiescent galaxies were active in the past .",
    "it is therefore essential to investigate the fueling process in order to understand the nature of agns , particularly the difference between _ active _ and _ starving _ nuclei .",
    "a promising fuel source is molecular gas , because it dominates the interstellar matter ( ism ) in the circumnuclear regions ( kilo - parsec scale ) of many spiral galaxies .",
    "it is , however , not obvious how it could be transported from typical galactic radii ( @xmath3 10 kpc ) down to the scale of the central engine ( @xmath12 1 pc ) .",
    "galactic bars are frequently invoked as candidates for facilitating the transfer of mass in a host of active galaxies ( e.g. , shlosman et al .",
    "in fact , the bar - driven gas structures can be widely seen in many seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; kohno et al .  1999b ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . there appears , however , observational evidence _ against _ the bar - induced fueling scenario as well .",
    "ho et al .  (",
    "1997c ) have reported that galaxies hosting agns do not appear to be significantly affected by the presence of a bar , based on their extensive optical spectroscopic survey of 486 nearby galaxies .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached ( hunt , malkan 1999 ) using 891 galaxies in an extended 12 @xmath13 m sample ( rush et al .",
    "we should note that their conclusion was based on an optical morphology classification which could be severely affected by dust extinction ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "near - infrared ( nir ) photometric surveys have also suggested that a significant fraction of the seyfert galaxies show no evidence for the presence of barred potentials ( mcleod , rieke 1995 ; mulchaey , regan 1997 ) , although seyfert host galaxies seem to be barred more often than non - active galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "high angular resolution snapshot surveys using hst nicmos also failed to find any signature of a strong bar for many of seyfert galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; but see @xcite ) . given the absence of bars , then ,",
    "what kind of physical processes can drive the ism into the nuclear region ?    in order to investigate the distributions and kinematics of the ism in non - barred seyfert galaxies , we carried out high - resolution co(@xmath0 = 10 ) observations of the type-1.5 seyfert galaxy ngc 5033 ( ho et al .",
    "1997a , 1997b ) .",
    "nir broad - band photometry was also performed to determine the underlying potential from the stellar surface density , and also to see the distribution of ism via nir color .",
    "ngc 5033 is classified as non - barred in both the third reference catalogue of bright galaxies ( rc3 ; de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) and a revised shapley - ames catalog of bright galaxies ( rsa ; sandage , tammann 1987 ) . the distribution and kinematics of atomic gas in ngc 5033 have been investigated , and a warping of the galactic plane at larger radii ( @xmath14 a few kpc ) is reported ( e.g. , bosma 1981 ; @xcite ; thean et al .",
    "1997 ) , but there is little evidence for a bar ( thean et al .",
    "ngc 5033 is therefore an unique target to investigate the distribution and kinematics of ism in non - barred seyfert hosts .",
    "this galaxy is also suitable for a detailed study of the structure because of its proximity ( @xmath15 = 18.7 mpc ; tully 1988 ) and large apparent size ( @xmath16 ; de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "the basic properties of ngc 5033 are listed in table 1 .",
    "we describe millimeter and nir observations in section 2 , and present new results on co and nir emission in section 3 . in section 4 , we show that the molecular gas distribution and kinematics in the central a few kpc region of ngc 5033 are governed by a _",
    "small _ nuclear bar .",
    "gravitational instabilities of the molecular gas in the center of ngc 5033 are also discussed , implying the absence of strong nuclear star formation in the center of the type-1.5 seyfert galaxy ngc 5033 .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "the central region of ngc 5033 was observed in the @xmath0=10 line of co with the nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) .",
    "the observations were made during two separated runs , from 1993 december to 1994 april for the c and d configurations , and in 1996 january for the ab configuration . due to the limitation of the minimum projected baseline length ( 10 m ) , extended structures larger than about 50@xmath17 in each channel map were not sampled in the observations .",
    "the front - ends were tunerless sis receivers , whose receiver temperature was about 40 k in the double side band , and the system noise temperatures ( in single side band ) were 400  800 k during the observations . a digital spectro - correlator fx was configured to cover 320 mhz with 1024 channels per baseline .",
    "a side - band separation was achieved by 90@xmath18 phase switching .",
    "we observed a continuum source , 1308 + 326 , every 30 minutes to monitor the temporal variations of the instrumental complex gain .",
    "the passband across 1024 channels was calibrated through observations of 3c 273 .",
    "the flux density of 1308 + 326 was determined from comparisons with planets of known brightness temperatures . the uncertainty in the absolute flux scale is estimated to be @xmath19 20% .",
    "the raw data were calibrated and edited using the package uvproc - ii developed at nro ( @xcite ) , and then fourier transformed with natural weighting using the aips task mx .",

    "most of the single - dish flux seems to be recovered by our observations , and we can safely discuss the distribution and kinematics of the molecular gas below .      a velocity - integrated intensity map of the co emission is shown in figure 2b , with an optical image of ngc 5033 ( figure 2a ) from the digitized sky survey .",
    "this co image was obtained from the 0-th moment of the co data cube with the aips task momnt . to minimize the contribution from noise",
    ", we computed a moment map with a clip level of @xmath40 in each channel map .",
    "the most outstanding feature seen in the integrated intensity map of co , figure 2b , is two strong co peaks , which appear to straddle the nucleus .",
    "these two co peaks lie along the major axis of the galaxy ( @xmath41 = @xmath42 ) , and are separated by @xmath43 ( 270 pc ) from the nucleus .",
    "we also find offset ridges of the co emission , emanating from the two co peaks , along a @xmath41 of about @xmath44 .",
    "it is evident that there is an extended and patchy disk - like structure over the field of view .",
    "the outer boundary of the co emission is almost elliptical , with an axial ratio of about 0.4 .",
    "this axial ratio can be explained as a disk with an intrinsically circular boundary , at an inclination angle of @xmath45 .",
    "this inclination angle of the molecular disk agrees with that of the whole galaxy ( table 1 ; thean et al .",
    "the radius of the disk - like structure is about @xmath46 = 2.7 kpc .",
    "this size is mostly consistent with a @xmath47 resolution co map obtained from bima observations ( wong , blitz 2002 ) .",
    "a careful inspection of the co map suggests that some of the co patches on the `` disk '' are a part of continuous structures , such as a ring and a spiral arm .",
    "the ring and spiral - arm like structures are particularly remarkable in the southern part of the map , as traced by the solid lines in figure 3 .",
    "these overall co structure agree well with recent ovro millimeter array observations ( baker 1999 ) .",

    "the co spectra near the two central peaks are characterized by broad line widths ( @xmath49 200 km s@xmath21 in fwhm ) and double or multiple peaked profiles , while the co spectra in the disk region show single gaussian - shaped profiles and narrow widths ( @xmath3 50 km s@xmath21 in fwhm ) .",

    "the @xmath58 level of the co integrated intensity map , 2.0 jy beam@xmath21 km s@xmath21 or 13 k km s@xmath21 in @xmath23 , corresponds to a face - on molecular gas surface density of @xmath59 @xmath60 pc@xmath61 ( or a h@xmath62 column density of @xmath63 @xmath64 ) , and the co peak ( about @xmath65 ) is 320 @xmath60 pc@xmath61 , including he and heavier element masses , as @xmath66 .",
    "note that the gas surface densities do nt depend on the adopted distance to the galaxy .",
    "the molecular gas density derived here should be compared with the atomic gas surface density ; thean et al . ( 1997 ) detected a _",

    "the molecular gas mass is then computed by multiplying the surface density of the gas by area . converting a unit of co intensity from k km",

    "the observed co flux within the central @xmath76 region is 430 jy km s@xmath21 , which corresponds to a total molecular gas mass of @xmath77 @xmath60 , including he and heavier elements ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "figure 5 shows the radial distribution of the molecular gas surface density in ngc 5033 .",
    "the integrated intensity of co in figure 2b was azimuthally averaged over successive annuli with @xmath79 = 90.7 pc width using the aips task iring , and was used to calculate the face - on molecular gas surface density by adopting the above formula .",
    "the maximum gas surface density is located at a radius of @xmath3 400 pc ( @xmath80 ) , not at the center . a second increase in the gas surface density",
    "is also evident at @xmath81 kpc ( @xmath5 ) , which corresponds to the radius of the `` partial ring '' denoted in figure 3 .",
    "figure 2c shows an intensity - weighted isovelocity contour map of the co emission .",
    "this map was made by computing the first moment of the co data cube , as @xmath82 .",
    "it is evident that circular motion dominates the kinematics in the central a few kpc region of ngc 5033 because a systematic change in the positions of the emission as a function of velocity with the overall symmetry can be seen , suggesting an ordered circular motion .",
    "however , as seen in the channel maps , this co velocity field also reveals a `` z - shape '' twist of isovelocity contours near the systemic velocity , which is a signature of non - circular motions .",
    "it is also clear that the isovelocity contours near the center tend to align with the position angle of the co ridges ( @xmath83 ) , rather than the kinematical minor axis ( @xmath84 ) . in a pure circular rotation case",
    ", the isovelocity contours near the systemic velocity should be straight lines perpendicular to the kinematical major axis ( i.e. , aligned to the minor axis ) .",
    "this deviation is also evident in the velocity channel maps of @xmath85 km s@xmath21 in figure 1 .",
    "we determined the kinematical parameters of the gas disk ( dynamical center , position angle of the major axis , inclination angle , and systemic velocity ) by a least - squares fitting of the intensity - weighted isovelocity field as a circular rotation .",
    "we used the gal package in aips for this analysis .",
    "the derived parameters are listed in table 3 .",
    "these results agree with values determined from the @xmath3 20@xmath17 resolution hi observations ( thean et al .",
    "it should be noted that the observed co velocity field contains local deviations from circular rotation , as described above ; however , and the kinematic parameters derived here can be affected by the non - circular motions . hence , , we adopted those determined by thean et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in the following analysis .",
    "a position  velocity diagram ( p  v diagram ) along the major axis ( @xmath41 = @xmath42 ) of ngc 5033 is displayed in figure [ fig : pv ] .",
    "we determined the circular rotation curve of the inner part of ngc 5033 from our co data by averaging the intensity - weighted mean velocities ( figure 2c ) within a @xmath86 area along the major axis of the galaxy , using the gal package in aips .",
    "the resultant rotation curve is shown in figure [ fig : rotcurve ] .",
    "the rotation velocities at the flat part are @xmath3 220 km s@xmath21 on the plane of the disk ( adopting @xmath57 ) .",
    "this agrees well with the @xmath3 20@xmath17 resolution hi observations ( thean et al .",
    "1997 ) and @xmath87 resolution co observations ( sofue 1997 ; @xcite ) .    near the center ( @xmath88 ) , this diagram shows a gradual rise of the rotation velocity .",
    "smearing of the observing beam is a possible cause of this _ gradual _ rise , and the true rotation velocity could be larger there .",
    "the co spectra near the center shows very broad and multiple velocity components ( figure [ fig : cospectra ] ) , and a simple moment analysis could fail to trace the true rotation velocities in this case .",
    "in fact , the p  v diagram in figure [ fig : pv ] shows a very steep rise of the rotation velocities near the center if we trace the terminal velocities as the true rotation velocities ; it reaches a constant ( flat rotation ) at @xmath89 . given our finite spatial resolution",
    ", the turnover radius of the rotation curve ( @xmath89 ) could be an upper limit .",
    "another possibility of a _ gradual _ rise of the circular rotation velocity is a bar ; non - circular motion associated with the presence of a bar may be the cause of a steeper p  v diagram than the actual rotation curve ( bureau , athanassoula 1999 ; athanassoula , bureau 1999 ) .",
    "it should the be noted that the velocity field contains significant non - circular motions , and the derived values must be treated as an averaged rotation curve ( e.g. , sakamoto et al .",
    "1999a ) , possibly with significant local deviations .    from these considerations ,",
    "we here assume a constant rotation velocity of 220 km s@xmath21 for @xmath90 , and a rigid - body rotation of @xmath91 km s@xmath21 pc@xmath21 for @xmath92 .",
    "this rotation curve is indicated as the dashed line in figure [ fig : rotcurve ] , and is applied to resonance identifications in the following discussion ( subsection 4.2 ) .",
    "note that baker ( 1999 ) reported that there is a kinematically decoupled gas component just around the center of ngc 5033 ( i.e. , between the two co peaks in figure 2b ) based on a p  v diagram of the ovro interferometer co(21 ) data ; however , the co(10 ) emission in our map seems to be too weak to identify such features .",
    "figure [ fig : dispersion ] shows the intensity - weighted co velocity dispersion along the line of sight , as derived from the second moment of the co data cube , @xmath93 .",
    "it should be noted that this map contains both the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the gas and the gradient of the rotation velocity in the observing beam ; the very large velocity dispersion area along the minor axis of the galaxy represents the steep rise of the rotation curve in the central region of the galaxy . near the center of the galaxy ,",
    "it is evident that the second moment values at the two central co peaks are quite large ( @xmath94 km s@xmath21 ) compared with other regions .",
    "the co line profiles in this area appear to deviate from a simple gaussian shape , and are perhaps multiple - peaked , as can be seen in figure 4 .",
    "therefore , the second moment values near the central co peaks should not be treated as a velocity dispersion of gas , yet complex gas kinematics near the two central co peaks is suggested .",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath24 band images obtained with the oasis observations are presented in figure [ fig : jandk ] .",
    "the surface brightness at the outer boundary is about 19 mag arcsec@xmath22 in the @xmath24 band , and 21 mag arcsec@xmath22 in the @xmath0 band , respectively .",
    "we also show contour maps of the @xmath24 band in the central @xmath95 region in figure [ fig : kcloseup ] .",
    "the overall @xmath24 band structures agree with the previous nir observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in order to quantify the incidence of a bar , we have fitted ellipses to isophotos of each band using the routine ellipse in the stsdas package within iraf .",
    "radial profiles of the surface brightness , ellipticity , and position angle derived from the ellipse fits of the @xmath24 band data are given in figure [ fig : kisophotofit ] . because of the better seeing size in @xmath24 than that of the @xmath0 band , the ellipse fitting near the nucleus is more reliable in the @xmath24 band .",
    "we find that the position angle abruptly changes from @xmath96 ( i.e. , the same as the position angle of galactic disk major axis ) to @xmath97 at a semimajor axis of @xmath3 8@xmath17 or 730 pc .",
    "this can also be seen in the contour map in figure [ fig : kcloseup ] , and may suggest the existence of an oval distortion .",
    "it is difficult to conclude the presence of a bar here , however .",
    "generally , the criteria for the identification of bars are ( i ) the ellipticity increases as a function of the radius to a maximum , and then decreases to reveal the inclination of the disk , and ( ii ) the position angle is constant over the radii where the ellipticity is rising ( mcleod , rieke 1995 ; mulchaey et al .",
    "1997 ) , but the highly inclined disk of ngc 5033 prevents us from a reliable identification of the bars .",
    "moreover , we find that the existence of the molecular spiral arms could also influence the isophotos , even in the @xmath24 band .",
    "if the observed nir features are 2-dimensional , we can deproject the isophotal contours by expanding figure [ fig : kcloseup ] along the minor axis by a factor of ( cos @xmath56)@xmath21 ; we then see the elongated distribution of the @xmath24 emission at a semi - major length of @xmath3 15@xmath17 .",
    "however , it is likely that the true distribution of low - mass stars , which dominate the @xmath24 emission observed here , is 3-dimensional , and hence the `` deprojection '' of the contour maps gives an upper limit of the oval structures in the @xmath24-band emission .",
    "the @xmath24-band image was convolved to the same resolution as the @xmath0-band data , and a @xmath98 color map was produced .",
    "figure [ fig : colorvsco ] shows the @xmath98 color map and a comparison with the integrated co intensity image .",
    "the co image was aligned to nir maps postulating the nir continuum peak as the position of the seyfert nucleus .",
    "a circumnuclear ring with a radius of @xmath3 1.3 kpc and two spiral arms are clearly seen in the @xmath98 color .",
    "these spirals are also clearly confirmed by the high angular resolution nir colors ( @xcite ) .",
    "we see that the ring and the two spiral arms in the @xmath98 color map agree well qualitatively with the co distribution .",
    "we can trace the successive co peaks along the ring and two spirals seen in the @xmath98 map .",
    "the two spirals seen in the @xmath98 map terminate at a radius of @xmath99 as well as the co map .",
    "thus , the abrupt cut - off of the co emission seen in figure 2b means that most of the ism , including hi gas , is really concentrated within this radius .",
    "this is supported by a co mapping over the entire disk ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and an 850 @xmath13 m dust continuum map ( doi 2002 , private communication ) .",
    "good correlations between co maps and nir color maps have been reported in other spiral galaxies ( e.g. , sakamoto et al .",
    "1995 ; hurt et al .",
    "1996 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the correspondence between co and @xmath98 color is particularly significant in the western side of the galaxy .",
    "this could mean that the western part of the galaxy is the near side ; because the ism would be distributed on a thin disk - like plane , in contrast to stars , more stars on the near side are reddened than those on the far side .",
    "this configuration indicates that the spiral arms seen in optical and co images are trailing .    on the other hand , we see a significant discrepancy between the nir color index and the co distribution within the central @xmath100 region ; the color map shows a single peak at the seyfert nucleus , whereas there exist two co peaks apart from the nucleus",
    ". it could be likely that the nir color near the active nucleus no longer reflects the dust extinction ( and therefore the distribution of the ism ) , as in the case of the nucleus in ngc 1068 ( hurt et al .",
    "in fact , hst observations of ngc 5033 at 1.6 @xmath13 m band show an unresolved source in the center of ngc 5033",
    ". it must be from the non - stellar activity , because its flux correlates with the hard x - ray luminosity ( @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath98 index toward the nucleus is 1.21 mag in ngc 5033 , which is a redder color .",
    "similar @xmath98 color indices toward seyfert nuclei can be found in the literature ( e.g. , forbes et al .",
    "1992 ; hunt , giovanardi 1992 ; alonso - herrero et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 ; @xcite ) .",
    "our high - resolution co and nir observations reveal a non - axisymmetric molecular gas distribution and perturbed gas kinematics in the central @xmath3 kpc region of ngc 5033 .",
    "the observed morphological features are : ( i ) two strong co peaks straddling the nucleus , separated by @xmath3 @xmath4 or 270 pc from the nucleus , ( ii ) a molecular ring with a radius of @xmath3 @xmath101 or 1.3 kpc , ( iii ) offset molecular ridges connecting the two co peaks and the molecular ring , and ( iv ) two - armed molecular spirals that terminate abruptly at a radius of @xmath3 @xmath46 or 2.7 kpc .",
    "we also find kinematical features : ( v ) double peaked and wide co line profiles near the two co peaks , and ( vi ) a twist of the isovelocity contours near the systemic velocity , which tend to align with the position angle of the co ridges .    in this section , we show that all of the observed molecular gas distribution and kinematics can be understood as a response to a _ small _ nuclear bar .",
    "we also discuss the gravitational instabilities of molecular gas in the center of ngc 5033 in order to show that no starburst coexists in the low - luminosity type-1.5 seyfert nucleus of ngc 5033 .",
    "the observed features listed above are reminiscent of those in the central regions of barred spiral galaxies ; first , the two conspicuous co peaks which appear to straddle the nucleus of the ngc 5033 quite resemble the `` co twin peaks '' widely observed in the central regions of barred galaxies ( e.g. , kenney et al .",
    "1992 ; kenney 1996 ) .",
    "second , the elongations of co emission from two co peaks mimic the dust - lane morphology of barred galaxies ( e.g. , athanassoula 1992 ) . offset ridge structures of co emission along the leading sides of a bar are often observed in the central regions of barred galaxies , such as ic 342 ( @xcite ) , ngc 1530 ( reynaud , downes 1998 ; @xcite ) , and ngc 3504 ( kuno et al .",
    "these morphological similarities of the co distribution tempt us to consider the existence of a bar at a position angle of @xmath102 , because the twin peaks seen in barred galaxies are usually oriented perpendicular to the stellar bars , and because co ridges should be located at the leading sides of the bars .",
    "the observed velocity field , where isovelocity contours deviate from the circular motion and tend to align with the position angle of the co ridges , is also consistent with the presence of a bar .",
    "this is because models of the gas dynamics in a barred potential predict that the largest velocity gradient should be seen across the bar ( e.g. , robert et al .",
    "1979 ) ; in fact , such features have been observed in the central regions of galaxies with bars .",
    "in addition to these , the apparent disagreement between the p  v diagram and the circular rotation velocities from a moment map seen in figure 7 could also be a suggestive of a bar . as mentioned in subsubsection 3.1.6 , a steeper p ",
    "v than the rotation curve can occur due to a bar ( bureau , athanassoula 1999 ; athanassoula , bureau 1999 ) .      in order to check whether an orbit resonance theory can explain the observed gas distribution",
    ", we examined the angular velocities of the molecular gas .",
    "the inner lindblad resonances ( ilrs ) will exist wherever @xmath103 at some location within the corotation , where @xmath104 is the rotation frequency at a radius of @xmath105 [ i.e. , @xmath106 , @xmath107 is the rotation frequency of the bar ( the pattern speed of the bar , and is constant with radius ) , and @xmath108 is the epicyclic frequency . for a higher order resonance , the ultra harmonic resonance ( uhr ; 4:1 resonance ) can also occur , where @xmath109 .    we think that there are two possible loci of the corotation resonance [ cr ; it occurs where @xmath110 from the observed co distribution : one is to assume that ( i ) a cut - off of the molecular gas distribution corresponds to a possible corotation radius , giving a possible cr radius @xmath111 or 2.7 kpc , and the other is ( ii ) to assume the cr lies near @xmath112 or 2.1 kpc , where a local dip of co is seen in the radial distribution of the molecular gas ( figure [ fig : coradialdistribution ] ) .",
    "these are because barred potentials sweep gas clouds inwards from the corotation up to ilrs ; also because the gas outside the corotation tends to accumulate near the outer lindblad resonance ( olr ) , the ism would be depopulated in the corotation resonance . this scenario has been successfully applied to several galaxies , such as ngc 891 ( garca - burillo , gulin 1995 ) and ngc 253 ( houghton et al .",
    "these assumptions immediately yield possible bar pattern - speeds of @xmath113 85 km s@xmath22 kpc@xmath22 for the first case ( i ) and @xmath113 105 km s@xmath22 kpc@xmath22 for the latter case ( ii ) , respectively , adopting the rotation curve discussed in subsubsection 3.1.6 ( also see figure [ fig : pv ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : resonance ] shows the angular velocities as a function of the galactocentric radius , i.e. , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 , where @xmath117 \\cdot [ v(r)/r + dv(r)/dr ] \\}^{0.5}$ ] , as well as the proposed range of the bar pattern speeds , @xmath107 .",
    "this resonance analysis means that the two observed co peaks and the elongated co ridges lie between the inner ilr ( iilr ) and outer ilr ( oilr ) .",
    "this situation is widely observed in the central regions of barred galaxies ( e.g. , kenney et al .",
    "1992 ; telesco et al .",
    "1993 ; kenney 1996 ; downes et al .  1996 ; kohno et al .",
    "1999a ) , although it must be treated with caution , because non - circular motions near the center of barred galaxies can severely affect the estimation of ilr radii ( sakamoto et al .",
    "these co peaks are considered to be orbit crowding zones where different families of gas streams , @xmath118 and @xmath119 , would be crossing .",
    "this would result in shocks along the orbit crowding region , as suggested by theory ( e.g. , athanassoula 1992 ) .",
    "in fact , very large velocity dispersion and/or complex co spectra with two or more peaks have been observed near the `` twin peaks '' of barred galaxies ( kenney 1996 ; kohno et al .  1999a ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , adding another bit of evidence for a bar - driven gas motion .",
    "figure [ fig : resonance ] also shows that the 1.3 kpc ring feature may correspond to the uhr if @xmath113 105 km s@xmath22 kpc@xmath22 ( i.e. , the assumption ( ii ) ) .",
    "nuclear rings possibly explained by uhr are observed in barred spiral galaxies , such as ngc 253 ( @xcite ) and ngc 5005 ( @xcite ) ; we therefore suggest that the larger @xmath107 ( i.e. , @xmath3 105 km s@xmath22 kpc@xmath22 ) may be more plausible . considering the uncertainties of the rotation velocities ,",
    "we conclude here that @xmath120 is in the range of about 2.1  2.7 kpc .",
    "given the @xmath121 2.1  2.7 kpc , this would also impose an upper limit on the bar length .",
    "in early type galaxies , it is now widely accepted that the corotation radius lies near to the bar end ; that is , @xmath120 is @xmath122 @xmath123 ( athanassoula 1992 ; elmegreen 1996 ) .",
    "on the other hand , a numerical simulation by combes and elmegreen ( 1993 ) suggested that bars in late - type galaxies may have their corotation radii well outside the bar ends ; possibly , @xmath120 is @xmath3 2 @xmath123 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , the possible bar radius ( semi - major radius ) in ngc 5033 would be in the range of about 0.5  1.2 @xmath120 , i.e.",
    ", 1.1  3.2 kpc , and probably near 0.5 @xmath120 or 1.1  1.4 kpc , as in the case of the bars in other late - type spirals , such as m 100 ( garca - burillo et al .",
    "1994 ; sempre et al .  1995 ; elmegreen et al .",
    "1992 ) .    the possible bar radius of @xmath3 1.1  1.4 kpc is also implied from the observed radial distribution of co emission ;",
    "recent co observations of barred galaxies demonstrate the existence of a `` secondary peak '' of the ism near the bar - ends ( kenney , load 1991 ; nakai 1992 ; downes et al .",
    "1996 ; @xcite ) , and the second enhancement of co emission at a radius of @xmath3 1.3 kpc seen in the co radial distribution of figure 4 may suggest that a plausible bar radius in ngc 5033 would indeed be @xmath3 1.1  1.4 kpc .    we should note that ngc 5033 has several rings in the outer disk region ( @xmath14 a few arcmin ) , as can be seen in the hi maps ( @xcite ) .",
    "these outer rings seem to be difficult to explain by only the small nuclear bar proposed here , because the olr of the nuclear bar would be located at about @xmath124 kpc or @xmath125 , which is much more inward than the outer hi rings .",
    "however , it is possible to understand the whole structure if ngc 5033 has multiple bars ; s. ishizuki ( 2002 , private communication ) proposed that there are three bars in the disk of ngc 5033 based on the deprojected hi map ( @xcite ) , assuming that the ilr radii of the outer bars correspond to the corotation radii of the inner bars ( @xcite ) .    in summary",
    ", both the distribution and kinematics of the molecular gas in the central region of ngc 5033 can be well understood as the response to a bar .",
    "we propose that a small nuclear bar lies along a position angle of @xmath102 and a possible semi - major radius of @xmath126 1.1  1.4 kpc ( @xmath7  @xmath8 ) .",
    "the pattern speed of the nuclear bar is estimated to be 85  105 km s@xmath21 pc@xmath21 .",
    "figure [ fig : faceonview ] displays our proposed interpretation of the gas distribution in the center of the `` non - barred '' seyfert galaxy ngc 5033 .",
    "this small nuclear bar would sweep the molecular gas inside the corotation radius and channel it into the central region of the galaxy .",
    "our results also demonstrate that high - resolution co imaging - spectroscopy is useful to search for a bar even in highly inclined systems where isophoto ellipse fitting techniques are not applicable .",
    "the fact that @xmath3 20@xmath17 resolution hi observations show little evidence for a bar in ngc 5033 ( thean et al .",
    "1997 ) would suggest that a large - scale nonaxisymmetry of underlying potential is not required for seyfert activity , and that high - resolution observations of the ism are crucial for studying the fueling mechanism of seyfert galaxies .",
    "as pointed out by mcleod and rieke ( 1995 ) , the critical elements of the fuel supply need not be visible on the _ large scale _ in the host galaxy .",
    "in fact , the possible bar length in ngc 5033 is quite small ; the semi - major radius of @xmath3 1.1  1.4 kpc corresponds to only @xmath127 .",
    "we should also note that a very weak bar can play a significant role on the ism .",
    "numerical simulations have predicted that the molecular gas distribution and kinematics severely affected even in a potential with a very weak asymmetry , a few % or less in density ( @xcite ; jungwiert , palous 1996 ) , which might not be easy to detect , even in the nir bands .",
    "hence , it seems that the apparent lack of a clear and strong bar / oval structure in the stellar surface density traced with nir continuum emission does not immediately mean that the ism in such galaxies is not driven into the central regions by a bar .",
    "nevertheless , it appears to be clear that the presence of a small - scale bar is _ not _ a _ sufficient _ condition for seyfert activity , though it could be a necessary condition . as described in the previous sections , bar - driven gas structures , such as the `` twin - peaks '' seen in ngc 5033 ,",
    "are widely observed in many barred spiral galaxies , but not every barred galaxies hosts an active nucleus .",
    "additional mechanisms , such as self - gravity of ism ( e.g. , @xcite ) or a `` nuclear ilr '' induced by the central super massive black holes ( fukuda et al .  1998 , 2000 ) , would be necessary to drive ism into the central engine",
    ".    it should also be noteworthy that a very small amount of gas is sufficient to sustain low - level seyfert activities .",
    "the required mass accretion rates , @xmath128 , in order to feed a given luminosity , @xmath129 , are expected to be @xmath130 ( @xcite ) for a typical luminosity of seyfert galaxies , where @xmath131 is the accretion efficiency . because ngc 5033 is a low - luminosity seyfert ( @xmath132 erg s@xmath21 , @xcite ; see also koratkar et al .",
    "1995 ) , the required gas mass is only @xmath133 to feed the monster over a time of @xmath134 yr .",
    "this may explain why not all seyfert hosts are barred ; a high @xmath128 , which can be achieved by a bar , is not always required for low - luminosity agns ( ho et al .",
    "1997c ) .",
    "a massive nuclear starburst is often associated with seyfert galaxies . in particular , a large fraction ( about 50% , @xcite ) of type-2 seyfert nuclei are reported to coexist with a nuclear starburst ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these nuclear starbursts can be in the dense obscuring torus ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which would play an important role to form a geometrically thick torus via energy feedback from supernovae ( @xcite ) .    in order to address the nuclear star formation in the type-1.5 seyfert galaxy ngc 5033 , we examined the gas mass fraction to the dynamical mass , @xmath135/@xmath136 , in the center of ngc 5033 . in galaxies with nuclear starburst / star formation",
    ", @xmath135/@xmath136 often exceeds 10% ( e.g. , @xcite ; sakamoto et al .",
    "such a high gas fraction results in the unstable states of molecular gas , and eventually massive star formation occurs there ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the @xmath135/@xmath136 values can be a rough diagnostic of starbursts in the centers of galaxies .",
    "the dynamical mass within a given radius @xmath105 is calculated as @xmath137 ^ 2 m_\\odot \\mbox{,}\\ ] ] where @xmath138 is a circular rotation velocity at a galactocentric radius of @xmath105 , assuming a spherical mass distribution .",
    "the dynamical mass within a radius of 30@xmath17 or 2.7 kpc , the outer boundary of the co emission , was then calculated to be 3.0 @xmath2 10@xmath139 @xmath60 , and the ratio of dynamical mass to the total molecular gas mass @xmath9 is 0.081 within @xmath140 kpc .",
    "the gas mass ratio , @xmath9 , remains almost constant over the molecular disk ; the @xmath9 within @xmath141 kpc ( @xmath8 ) , which corresponds to the radius of the molecular ring , is found to be 0.063 .",
    "it drops to 0.006 in the very center ( @xmath92 or 180 pc ) , however .",
    "this @xmath9 of 0.006 is very small compared with that in nuclear starburst galaxies , where the ratio often exceeds 0.1 ( e.g. , sakamoto et al .  1999b ) .",
    "we therefore suggest that the molecular gas in the central @xmath142 pc region of ngc 5033 may not be self - gravitating , in contrast to the situation in nuclear starburst galaxies .",
    "this implies that no nuclear starburst coexists in the center of the type-1.5 seyfert galaxy ngc 5033 , in accord with high - resolution nir spectroscopic studies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , though extended star - forming regions exist in the disk of ngc 5033 ( e.g. , clavel et al .",
    "2000 ; wang , blitz 2002 ) . further analysis of high - resolution molecular gas data in type-1 seyferts and a comparison with that in type-2s will help in the study of the role of nuclear starbursts in the agn phenomenon .",
    "the uncertainty of the derived @xmath9 values could be large near the center , because the circular rotation velocity adopted here can be affected by the presence of non - circular motions in the central region of ngc 5033 .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath9 values in the center of ngc 5033 can be very small because the molecular gas mass near the center of ngc 5033 may be overestimated ; the conversion factors in the central regions of galaxies ( including the galactic center region ) tend to be _ smaller _ than those in the galactic disk gmcs by a factor of 3  10 or more ( e.g. , nakai , kuno 1995 ; solomon et al .",
    "1997 ; oka et al .  1998 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , which would result in a further decreasing of @xmath9 in the nucleus of ngc 5033 .",
    "our high - resolution aperture synthesis co(10 ) observations and nir broad - band photometry were performed toward the central region of the `` non - barred '' seyfert galaxy ngc 5033 .",
    "the results of the observations are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "our high - resolution co images reveal a perturbed distribution of molecular gas in the center of the `` non - barred '' seyfert galaxy ngc 5033 ; we find ( i ) two strong co peaks straddling the nucleus , separated by @xmath3 @xmath4 or 270 pc from the nucleus , ( ii ) a molecular ring with a radius of @xmath3 @xmath101 or 1.3 kpc , and ( iii ) offset molecular ridges connecting the two co peaks and the molecular ring .",
    "these are the characteristic gaseous features that are widely observed in the centers of barred galaxies",
    "we find that broad ( @xmath49 200 km s@xmath22 in fwhm ) and double - peaked profiles are seen near the two co peaks , which would support the idea that the two observed co concentrations are the orbit crowding regions where different families of gas orbits ( @xmath118 and @xmath119 ) in the bar meet there .",
    "the observed velocity field also suggests the presence of a bar in ngc 5033 .",
    "3 .   outside the ring , we find two armed spiral structures , which abruptly terminate at the radius of @xmath3 @xmath46 or 2.7 kpc , showing an excellent agreement to the @xmath98 color index map . however , in the very center of the active nucleus , the @xmath98 color does not reflect the distribution of ism .",
    "4 .   based on the resonance analysis of the molecular gas",
    ", we propose that the gas distribution and kinematics in the central a few kpc region of ngc 5033 are governed by a small nuclear bar .",
    "the possible bar properties , i.e. , the position angle , semi - major radius , and pattern speed , are estimated to be about @xmath143 , @xmath3 1.1  1.4 kpc ( @xmath7  @xmath8 ) , and @xmath3 85  105 km s@xmath21 pc@xmath21 , respectively .",
    "the parameter of the nuclear bar proposed here can account for all of the observed co features with consistency .",
    "5 .   although we could not confirm the presence of a nuclear bar from nir photometry due to the high inclination angle of ngc 5033 , we did obtain an upper limit of the bar radius , @xmath144 .",
    "this is consistent with the size of the bar deduced from the co data .",
    "these results demonstrate that high - resolution co imaging - spectroscopy is useful to search for a bar even in highly inclined systems where isophoto fitting techniques are not applicable .",
    "the fraction of molecular gas mass to the dynamical mass , @xmath9 , is very small ( @xmath10 % within @xmath92 or 180 pc ) .",
    "this would suggest that the molecular gas accumulated in this region is not self - gravitating , in contrast to nuclear starburst / star - forming galaxies , implying no nuclear starburst coexists in the type-1.5 seyfert galaxy ngc 5033 .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath9 values near the center could contain large uncertainties due to a strong non - circular motion in the central region of ngc 5033 , however .",
