    "many years of study of the light curves and spectra of type ia supernovae have revealed that a thermonuclear runaway induced by accretion on a white dwarf of @xmath21 m@xmath3 ( hoyle & fowler 1960 ) produces the energy to eject the entire star at @xmath210,000 km s@xmath4 and synthesizes @xmath20.1 - 1.0 m@xmath3 of radioactive @xmath0ni .",
    "prior to the maximum luminosity , the ejecta are opaque and both the explosion energy and the energy from the @xmath0ni@xmath5co@xmath5fe decays are deposited in and diffuse outward through the ejecta .",
    "after the bolometric light curve reaches its peak , the luminosity approaches the instantaneous decay power ( arnett 1980 ; 1982 ) and the luminosity decline follows the decay of @xmath0co , with @xmath6-ray scattering and absorption dominating energy deposition .",
    "later , due to expansion , @xmath6-ray optical depth decreases and the bolometric light curve decline becomes steeper than the @xmath0co decay . around @xmath7 200@xmath8 , almost all @xmath6-ray photons directly escape the ejecta and positrons from the decay of @xmath0co provide the main source of energy deposition into the ejecta . at this time , the light curve settles onto another , lower , @xmath0co decay curve . beyond this time the light curve evolution depends on the details of positron transport and energy loss .",
    "here we calculate energy deposition in type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) for @xmath7 60@xmath9 , when the photon diffusion time is short and the bolometric luminosity is almost entirely due to gamma - ray and positron energy loss processes",
    ".    there has been significant progress in understanding the physics of the early type ia light curves .",
    "detailed radiation transport and expansion opacity computations have reproduced observations of the bolometric and filter light curves ( i.e. , pinto & eastman 1998 ; hflich , mller , & khokhlov 1993 ; woosley & weaver 1986 ) .",
    "it is clear that the light curve s rapid early evolution is due to the explosion of a low mass compact object with a short radiative diffusion time ( arnett 1982 ; pinto & eastman 1998 ) .",
    "the secondary ir - maximum is the result of a photospheric radius that continues to expand after visual maximum .",
    "the differences in pre - maximum rise - times among observed sne can be explained in model - dependent terms as due to the differences in a transition from a deflagration flame to a detonation .",
    "the connections among peak luminosity , light curve width , and post - maximum slope with the ejecta mass , @xmath0ni location , kinetic energy of explosion , and opacity are explored in an elegant paper by pinto & eastman ( 1998 ) .",
    "comparisons between early observed light curves and many various theoretical models have been made extensively in recent years ( hflich , wheeler , & thielemann 1998 ; hflich et al .",
    "1996 ; hflich & khokhlov 1996 ( hereafter hk96 ) ) .",
    "we take the results of these works as given and extend the comparison of the models and observations to later times .    for a few bright sne ia in the past half - century ,",
    "good light curves beyond @xmath7 200@xmath8 have been obtained and studied .",
    "the first work that utilized the information from late light curves was done by colgate , petschek , & kriese ( 1980 ) .",
    "they showed that the late photographic and b band light curves of sn 1937c & sn 1972e can be explained with positron kinetic energy deposition from @xmath0co decays , as suggested by arnett ( 1969 ) .",
    "recently colgate ( 1991 , 1997 ) analyzed late light curves with positron transport to infer the ejecta mass .",
    "they found that ejecta somewhat transparent to positrons was required to fit observed light curves .",
    "cappellaro et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ( hereafter capp ) studied the influence of the mass of ejecta and the total mass of @xmath0ni on sn ia light curves , and concluded that the fraction of positron energy deposition varies among the five sne ia they analyzed , from complete transparency to a complete trapping of the positrons .",
    "ruiz - lapuente & spruit ( 1998 ) ( hereafter rls ) studied the effects of magnetic field geometry and magnitude in exploding white dwarfs to explain observed sne ia bolometric light curves .",
    "they found that the sn 1991bg magnetic field was weak ( @xmath1010@xmath11 g ) , while for sn 1972e a full trapping of positrons by a tangled magnetic field in a chandrasekhar mass model was required .",
    "in addition to furthering our understanding of sne ia , we are motivated by the possibility that the galactic diffuse 511 kev emission might be due to the annihilation of positrons that escape from sne ia , in addition to other possible sources such as core - collapse sn radioactivity and compact objects .",
    "the long lifetime of energetic positrons in the ism ( 10@xmath11 - 10@xmath12 yrs ) would mean that positrons from many sne ia would appear as a diffuse component of the 511 kev line emission .",
    "chan & lingenfelter ( 1993 ) ( hereafter cl ) calculated the number of surviving positrons from type ia supernova models for different magnetic field assumptions .",
    "combining their positron yields with supernova rate estimates , they suggested that type ia sne could provide from an insignificant to a dominant contribution to the observed diffuse galactic annihilation radiation flux  depending on the magnetic field geometry .",
    "average escape of a few per cent of @xmath0co positrons are necessary to contribute to the galactic emission , i.e. , @xmath150% of those emitted after one year would have to escape .",
    "if the escapees take a significant fraction of their kinetic energy with them , we might be able to see the power deficit in the measured light curves .",
    "thus we hope to use observed light curves to determine the sne ia contribution to galactic positrons and obtain information about the magnetic fields in sne ia .",
    "because of the variety of observed sn ia properties and numerous physical details that remain uncertain , there are many possible models allowed ( for a review see nomoto et al .",
    "we do not try to make judgements among them .",
    "we calculate the late bolometric light curves of deflagration , delayed detonation , pulsed - delayed detonation , he detonation , and accretion - induced collapse ( aic ) models for comparison with observed light curves . for",
    "each observed sn we consider the model(s ) suggested by other authors to agree with observations near maximum light .",
    "we begin by fitting each model to the observations ( to the inferred bolometric light curve when available ) in the interval 100200 days , when gamma - ray energy deposition is still important .",
    "we then follow each model to later times for various choices of magnetic field configuration and assumed ionization state of the ejecta , and compare the calculated power deposited to the observed light curves .",
    "in addition to the specific light curve consequences of positron transport we examine some more generic features of the late light curves . we show that the light curve decline rate between 60 and 200 days after the explosion can be used to clarify total ejecta mass and expansion velocity of the supernova models .",
    "we find that the transition time between the gamma - ray and positron dominated phases is a useful diagnostic to measure the ejecta mass .",
    "in addition , the slope of the light curve at @xmath13200 days is a good indicator of the magnetic field configuration in the ejecta . as a baseline",
    ", we compare the calculated light curves from positron transport with the light curve that results from the immediate , in - situ kinetic energy deposition assumption , which has been typically assumed in early light curve calculations .",
    "the physics of energy deposition in type ia sne is discussed in section 2 , followed by a discussion of the strength and geometry of the magnetic field in the post - explosion ejecta .",
    "our bolometric light curves for both turbulent and radial field geometries are shown and described in section 3 for the various models used in our study .",
    "the issues confronting fitting model generated light curves to actual observations are discussed in section 4 . in section 5 ,",
    "we combine model predictions with sn data to fit a few of the best observed sne .",
    "we conclude with section 6 in which we use positron yields from our models to estimate the type ia contribution to the observations of 511 kev annihilation radiation in the galaxy .",
    "the @xmath0ni @xmath14 @xmath0co ( @xmath15 8.8@xmath9 ) decay proceeds via electron capture ( 100% ) and produces photons and neutrinos .",
    "the line photons have energies between 0.16 and 1.56 mev , with a mean energy in photons of 1.75 mev per decay .",
    "the @xmath0co @xmath14 @xmath0fe ( @xmath15 111@xmath9 ) decay proceeds 81% of the time via electron capture and 19% via positron emission ( @xmath16 decay ) .",
    "the line photons have energies between 0.85 and 3.24 mev , with mean energy in photons per decay of 3.61 mev .",
    "segre ( 1977 ) derived the distribution of positron kinetic energy ( which is shown in figure [ emit ] ) .",
    "the mean positron kinetic energy is 0.63 mev , so when multiplied by the branching ratio 0.19 , the mean positron energy per decay is 0.12 mev .",
    "the ratio of the mean photon energy to the mean positron kinetic energy is then @xmath2 30 .",
    "the photon luminosity will dominate until the deposition fraction for positrons ( f@xmath17 ) is @xmath2 30 times larger than the deposition fraction for photons ( f@xmath18 ) .",
    "the energy deposition from both gammas and positrons depend upon two factors ; how much material must be traversed enroute to the surface , and the interaction cross - sections .",
    "the transport of gamma rays and positrons will be developed separately .",
    "the gamma - line photons from the decays of @xmath0ni@xmath19co@xmath19fe are mostly compton scattered to lower energy during the early phases of the type ia event . these photons",
    "then escape as x - ray continuum or are absorbed by material in the ejecta via the photo - electric effect . due to the supernova expansion , the gamma - line optical depth decreases , becoming low enough at late - times that most gamma - line photons escape directly . in calculating the energy deposition and the energy escape fraction of the photon energy created by the radioactive decays ,",
    "we simulate the scatter adopting the prescription of podznyakov , sobol , & sunyaev ( 1983 ) .",
    "a detailed description of the monte carlo algorithm and its application in calculating the spectra and bolometric light curves of sn1987a and type ia supernovae have been presented by the , burrows , & bussard ( 1990 ) and burrows & the ( 1990 ) .",
    "figure [ frace ] shows the fraction of the total decay energy that escapes directly as gamma - lines and emerges as x - ray continuum ( f@xmath20 ) as well as the fractions deposited by scattering ( f@xmath21 ) and photoelectric absorption ( f@xmath22 ) as functions of time for model w7 ( nomoto , thielemann & yokoi 1984 ) , which we use for illustration here .",
    "the solid curve labeled with f@xmath23 (= f@xmath21 + f@xmath22 ) is the total gamma - ray energy deposition fraction .",
    "scattering dominates over photoelectric absorption at all times , the photoelectric absorption becoming relatively less important as there become fewer multiply scattered photons at late times .",
    "the overall photon deposition fractionscales roughly as t@xmath24 , reflecting the time dependence of the column depth to the surface from any location in the ejecta .",
    "the cross sections for the various modes of positron annihilation are strongly energy - dependent and favor low energies .",
    "energetic positrons will move through the ejecta until slowed to thermal velocities and then quickly annihilate .",
    "five energy - loss mechanisms were included : ionization and excitation of bound electrons , synchrotron emission , bremsstrahlung emission , inverse compton scattering , and plasma losses .",
    "the first four are described in detail in cl .",
    "we include these processes in a calculation of model w7 , first assuming a uniformly 1% ionized medium ( i.e. , 0.01 free electrons per nucleus ) and then a uniformly triply ionized medium . the results , shown in figure  [ eloss ] , support cl s conclusion that for low ionization , the interactions with bound electrons dominate the energy loss . for higher ionization , we find that plasma energy losses must be included .",
    "regardless of the ionization , processes other than ionization and excitation and plasma losses can be ignored .",
    "the ionization and excitation energy loss rate used is ( heitler 1954 ; blumenthal @xmath25 gould 1970 ; gould 1972 ; berger @xmath25 seltzer 1954 ) ,    @xmath26    @xmath27,\\ ] ]    where e is the positron s kinetic energy , r@xmath28 is the classical electron radius , and m@xmath29 and m@xmath30 are the electron and atomic mass unit masses respectively .",
    "z@xmath31 and a are the effective nuclear charge and atomic mass of the ejecta .",
    "@xmath32 is the effective ionization potential and is approximated by segre ( 1977 ) and by roy @xmath25 reed(1968 ) as ,    @xmath33    the plasma energy loss was described by axelrod ( 1980 ) .",
    "the formula is the same as ionization and excitation , except @xmath34 is inserted in the calculation of the maximum impact parameter ( b@xmath35 ) rather than the mean ionization potential ( @xmath32 ) , and @xmath36 , the number of free electrons per nucleus ( hereafter ionization fraction ) is used rather than z@xmath31 .",
    "thus , ( z@xmath31 + @xmath36)@xmath37n = z@xmath37n is the total electron density . ignoring small differences in the relativistic corrections , when the two energy losses are summed ,    @xmath38    @xmath39,\\ ] ]    where p(e ) is the relativistic correction .",
    "there is an ionization fraction dependence due to the inequality between @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "an ionized medium is more efficient at slowing positrons than is a neutral medium .",
    "the ionization fraction must be known as a function of mass , radius , and time to determine the energy deposition exactly , but is not currently well understood .",
    "pinto & eastman ( 1996 ) , liu , jeffery & schultz ( 1997 ) , and fransson & houck ( 1996 ) arrived at different ionization structures for similar models .",
    "unable to improve this situation , we choose to calculate a range of ionization fractions to bracket the possibilities .",
    "we consider extreme values of the ionization fraction , 0.01 and 3.0 , because the actual values are almost certainly between these during the times we consider .",
    "the positron transport was done with a 1d monte carlo code .",
    "sn models were reduced to 75 - 150 zones and up to 34 elements .",
    "positrons were emitted at equally spaced time intervals from each zone ( volume - weighted , random locations within the zone ) , weighted according to the @xmath0ni(zone , t ) .",
    "positrons were followed in steps of equal column depth ; the time , energy , radial distance , zone , pitch angle , and annihilation probability were re - evaluated at each step .",
    "the range of positrons in various solid media has been measured in the laboratory ( icru report # 37 ( 1984 ) ) .",
    "figure [ range ] compares the laboratory results with the ranges of individual positrons through sn ejecta , combining the data from a number of models .",
    "the model results for low ionization are in good agreement with the laboratory results , whereas the higher ionization leads to the medium being 2 - 3 times more efficient at stopping positrons .",
    "the spread of ranges for the triply ionized ejecta reflects the variation of the ejecta s composition .",
    "a positron will have a longer range in triply ionized iron than in triply ionized carbon because of the @xmath42 dependence of the more efficient energy loss to the plasma .",
    "it is unlikely that the zones rich in c , o , si and the other intermediate elements will maintain as high a level of ionization as the fe zones ( where the decays occur ) , so the uniformly triply - ionized approximation is a lower limit for positron escape .",
    "the 1% ionized ranges have less scatter because the ionization - excitation range depends upon @xmath43 , and with @xmath44 , @xmath45 0.5 in both fe - rich zones and c - rich zones .",
    "the range determines the escape fraction because when the column depth to the surface at a given radius is less than the stopping power for a given emission energy , a positron of that energy can escape ( after it deposits a fraction of its energy in the ejecta ) .",
    "a number of groups have transported positrons with the same treatment used with photons , assigning a @xmath46 , an  effective positron opacity \" , incorrectly giving them an exponential distribution of ranges .",
    "we do not use @xmath46 , but we can estimate its value for comparison from our results . defining that @xmath47 the mean of the inverse of the range expressed in units of inverse column depth ( @xmath48 g@xmath4 ) ; for @xmath36 = 0.01 , @xmath49 = 4 ; while for @xmath36 = 3 , @xmath49 = 14 .",
    "colgate transported positrons with @xmath49 = 10 @xmath48 g@xmath4 , as did ruiz - lapuente .",
    "axelrod argued for @xmath49 = 7 @xmath48 g@xmath4 , which was the nominal value in most fits shown by capp .",
    "the efficiency of matter at slowing positrons is one factor in determining the positron escape , the quantity of matter traversed enroute to the surface is another .",
    "the effects of the total mass and the nickel distribution will be discussed in section 4 , but these are secondary to the effects of the magnetic field ( cl ) , which will force positrons to follow curved paths .",
    "the progenitor white dwarfs have been observed to have initial field strengths of 10@xmath50 -10@xmath51 gauss ( leibundgut 1995 ) .",
    "the field is assumed to diffuse on a long time - scale relative to the positron lifetimes , so the flux is treated as frozen - in .",
    "thus the expansion causes the field strength to evolve according to the relation , b(r ) = b(r@xmath28 ) r@xmath52 r@xmath24 .",
    "if the resulting field is strong enough to make the positron gyroradius smaller than the ejecta at a given time , the geometry of the field must be considered .",
    "little is known about sn ia magnetic fields , so we consider three scenarios ; radial magnetic field , disordered field , no field .",
    "thus we also bracket the extreme magnetic field configurations , and late observations of sn ia luminosities are potentially probes of the field characteristics .",
    "a radial field is an approximation of the effect of the rapid , homologous expansion of the ejecta stretching out the arbitrarily oriented field lines as it changes scale by a factor 10@xmath53 as it grows .",
    "positrons spiral inward or outward on these field lines , changing pitch angle due to mirroring and beaming , as described by cl . these bend trajectories radially outward , so this `` radial scenario '' is a favorable one for positron escape .",
    "a turbulent , confining field is presumably adjusted or generated by expansion dynamics ( rl & spruit 1997 ) , with the limiting case of a positron having no net radial motion ( in mass coordinates ) as it meanders near the location of its emission zone for all times .",
    "this is called the  trapping scenario \" .",
    "there is some survival of positrons in place , if their slowing times exceed the age of the supernova , but by definition there is no escape .",
    "the third scenario ignores magnetic fields , so the positrons travel straight - line trajectories .",
    "this is referred to as the  free scenario \" .",
    "combining the results of the gamma - ray and positron transport calculations , we obtain the rate of energy deposition throughout the sn ejecta .",
    "this energy is then mainly contained in suprathermal free electrons that slow and recombine into atoms , which then deexcite . as discussed for positrons above ,",
    "once the electrons reach energies of a few kev their slowing times , and the duration of the subsequent processes are short . at late times",
    "all the optical photons generated escape immediately without interaction .",
    "so , for the time of interest here , the major difference between the decay rate of the radioactivity and the supernova ( optical ) luminosity is the propagation times of the gamma rays and positrons , and we therefore treat the calculated power deposited and bolometric luminosity as being interchangeable .",
    "a typical calculated bolometric light curve ( power deposition ) is shown in figure [ bol ] .",
    "the initial climb to peak luminosity is generated by energy deposition from the thermonuclear burning and from the @xmath0ni decays , followed by the diffusion of light to the photosphere .",
    "the width of the peak is governed by the diffusion time from the @xmath0ni to the photosphere .",
    "observed sne have shown variations of peak width , which should arise naturally out of any successful models .",
    "the factors that determine the light curve peak width are currently debated .",
    "hflich ( hflich & khokhlov 1996 ) asserts that the ejecta mass , the @xmath0ni distribution , and the @xmath0ni mass all influence the peak width .",
    "he fits narrow peaks with models which underproduce @xmath0ni ( relative to w7 ) .",
    "pinto & eastman ( 1996 ) asserts that the peak width only depends upon the first two .",
    "their radiation transport calculation showed that the energy deposition from the @xmath0ni adjusted the structure of the ejecta to make the peak width independent of the @xmath0ni production .",
    "they explain narrow peaks with low - mass models .    because we do not do the optical radiation transfer",
    ", we can not apply our calculations to this early epoch .",
    "we simply take models shown by other authors to fit individual supernova early light curves and spectra and calculate their subsequent bolometric light curves to be compared with late observations . by 60 days after the explosion",
    ", the photosphere has receded to the sn center ; after this time our calculations should trace the bolometric light curve . wd .",
    "if so , bolometric curves may fit the data as early as 30 days .",
    "the choice of 60@xmath9 as the time to initiate light curve fitting follows from leibundgut & pinto 1992 . ]    the light curve decline after 60@xmath9 is governed by the @xmath0co decay and the falling gamma - ray optical depth .",
    "thus the light curve shape is a diagnostic of the mass overlying the ni - rich zones and the velocity structure .",
    "the decline of the gamma deposition fraction ( f@xmath18 ) makes the light curve steeper than the decay .",
    "faster models reach the transition to positron dominated power , when f@xmath18 = 0.03 , earlier .",
    "the time of this transition varies among models , occurring at 130@xmath9 -520@xmath9 .",
    "the ejecta is still too dense at these times for the positrons to have appreciable lifetimes , so the light curves flatten toward the @xmath0co decay line ( rls ) . during this epoch ,",
    "the various field geometry scenarios produce identical results .",
    "further expansion of the ejecta leads to appreciable positron lifetimes , and in the radial and free scenarios , escape .",
    "then the light curves begin to separate . for the radial and free scenarios , positron escape leads to kinetic energy loss from the system and a drop in the light curve . for the trapping scenario ,",
    "a finite positron lifetime combined with the exponential decline in the number of newly created positrons leads to a shallow dip followed by a late flattening of the light curve , as positron kinetic energy is stored and delivered a ( lengthening ) positron slowing time after emission .",
    "figure [ intl ] contrasts the integrated luminosities for the trapping and radial scenarios as compared to the instantaneous deposition approximation . the delayed luminosity is seen in figure [ bol ] as the trapping curve is brighter than the instantaneous deposition curve at late - times . for the radial scenario , positrons ( and thus kinetic energy ) can leave the system , leading to a much larger deviation from the instantaneous deposition . as this energy is increasingly leaving the system at late - times ,",
    "the radial light curve in figure [ bol ] is dimmer than either the instantaneous deposition curve or the trapping curve .",
    "as the radial and trapping curves diverge , the separation becomes great enough to be measurable , in principle .",
    "it turns out that there is surprisingly little difference in the mean path traversed to the surface for these two cases . assuming isotropic emission of positrons , the mean distance to the surface from a given point , for positrons not near the center of the ejecta , is substantially larger than the radial distance to the surface because of the large solid angle perpendicular to the radius . in the radial field case , mirroring and beaming turn positron trajectories outward , but the extra path due to the spiral around the field adds similar distance as in the no - field case .",
    "the net energy deposition and positron escape for the models we consider are almost indistinguishable for these two cases .",
    "this result was anticipated by colgate ( 1996 ) , and can be approximately demonstrated analytically .",
    "we display radial field calculations , but remind the reader that for our spherically symmetric models the conclusions apply equally to field - free scenarios . for a few of the models ,",
    "there were slight deviations at late - times ( t @xmath1 800@xmath9 , the field - free curves remaining steeper than the radial curves ) .",
    "we show field - free light curves only when the separation between these these two cases is potentially detectable .",
    "the effects of positron escape on the sn light curve are moderated somewhat by gamma - ray energy deposition .",
    "longer - lived radioactivities that were overwhelmed at earlier epochs become important at late times .",
    "two such radionuclei are @xmath54ni and @xmath55ti .",
    "the decay of @xmath54ni proceeds with @xmath56 = 52@xmath57 and @xmath58 = 392@xmath9 , thus at 500@xmath9 , 28% of the @xmath54co has yet to decay .",
    "the @xmath54co decay energy is only 1/10 that of the @xmath0co .",
    "for w7 the energy available from @xmath54co equals that available from @xmath0co at 1000@xmath9 .",
    "other models have similar @xmath54ni/@xmath0ni ratios .",
    "@xmath55ti is an even longer - liver radionucleus , with a mean - life recently estimated to be 85@xmath59 1@xmath60 ( ahmad et al .",
    "the 1.3 mev decay energy is substantial , but the slow decay rate delays the cross - over to @xmath55ti dominated deposition until 2500@xmath9 , when no sn ia has been detected .",
    "five models had the @xmath54co and @xmath55ti masses included . for the other models , m@xmath61 = 0.041 m@xmath62 and m@xmath63 = 1.5 x 10@xmath64 m@xmath62 , to match w7 .",
    "figure [ pfrac ] shows the fraction of the luminosity that is due to the deposition of positron ke .",
    "the positron deposition is dominant from 300@xmath9 -800@xmath9 for the radial field geometry .",
    "the effects of including longer - lived radioactivities is shown by the splitting of the curves at late times .",
    "there are a number of other potential sources of luminosity , both intrinsic and extrinsic .",
    "one extrinsic source is the `` light echo '' , bright peak light scattered by dust back into the line of sight after light travel delays .",
    "sn 1991 t was dominated by a light echo by day 600 ( schmidt et al .",
    "1994 ) , as discussed in section 4 .",
    "another extrinsic source is the interaction of the ejecta with the surrounding medium .",
    "this interaction will eventually be important , but should be identified by distinctive spectral and temporal characteristics .    the sn model light curves presented in this work are based on the assumption that the deposited power is instantly radiated in the uvoir bands , during the time 12 years .",
    "furthermore , during this epoch , we usually have only the v and/or b band observations , instead of the bolometric luminosity , with which to compare models",
    ". fitting model light curves to single or dual bands is susceptible to intrinsic spectral evolution effects .",
    "as the secondary electrons lifetimes increase and the collisional de - excitation rates fall , a delay develops between the positron energy deposition and emission of uvoir light , an effect called  freeze - out \" by fransson ( 1996 ) .",
    "if the fe i and ii states form in abundance without photoionization or charge exchange destruction , then [ feii]@xmath6525.99@xmath66 , @xmath6535.35@xmath66 , and [ fei]@xmath6524.05@xmath66 fine structure emission lines are produced .",
    "these lines are beyond the ubvri bands and are undetected .",
    "this effect is referred to as an infrared catastrophe ( irc ) by axelrod ( 1980 ) . both freeze - out and irc phenomena must be considered and are discussed in section 5 .",
    "it is clear that at very late times , many complicating effects , including new sources of luminosity and sinks outside the normally observed bands can be important . therefore we confine our conclusions to the times when @xmath0co decay dominates the power input and the b and v bands track well the bolometric luminosity .",
    "we considered twenty - one models , which span the range of ejecta mass , @xmath0ni mass , and kinetic energy .",
    "one deflagration ( w7 ) ( nomoto , thielemann & yokoi 1984 ) , a normally luminous helium detonation ( hed8 ) ( hk96 ) , two subluminous helium detonations ( wd065 , hed6 ) ( ruiz - lapuente et al . 1993 ; hk96 ) , two superluminous helium detonations ( hecd , hed9 ) ( kumagai 1997 ; hk96 ) , one accretion - induced collapse ( onemg ) ( nomoto 1996 ) , eight delayed or late detonations ( dd4 , m36 , m35 , m39 , dd2o2c , dd23c , w7dn , w7dt ) ( woosley 1991 ; hflich 1995 ; hflich , wheeler & thielemann 1998 ; yamaoka 1992 ) , three pulsed , delayed detonations ( pdd3 , pdd54 , pdd1b ) ( hflich , khokhlov & wheeler 1995 ) , and two mergers ( det2 , det2env6 ) were included .",
    "their characteristics are shown in table 1 .    in figure",
    "[ gamma ] we show the luminosity due only to the gamma deposition . as expected",
    ", the total luminosity roughly traces the amount of @xmath0ni produced .",
    "the steepness of the early decline measures the mass overlying the ni .",
    "the models then flatten , with slopes becoming nearly equal . in figure [ fam400 ]",
    "we add the positron contribution to create bolometric light curves for radial field geometries , assuming 1% ionization .",
    "the curves start at and are normalized to 60@xmath9 to show the evolution of their shape from 60@xmath9 -400@xmath9 .",
    "there are often many observations during this epoch , so the different shapes provide a test of whether the model ( regardless of field characteristics ) fits the light curve .",
    "one interesting feature is the steepness of the chandrasekhar mass models , in which the @xmath0ni is covered by a large overlying mass .",
    "we interpret this steepness to be due to the delayed onset of the positron - dominated epoch .",
    "the low mass models enter this epoch earlier , so they flatten toward the decay line .",
    "table [ table1 ] shows the day when gamma deposition falls to equal the positron deposition .",
    "hed6 , wd065 , onemg , det2 have relatively little mass and transition before 180@xmath9 ; pdd1b and det2env6 have much more overlying mass and transition at 300@xmath9 or later .",
    "pdd1b thins to gamma photons so slowly , that it remains as bright as the low mass models due primarily to gamma deposition .",
    "other than the extreme model pdd1b , shallow declines after 60@xmath9 suggest models with less mass overlying the @xmath0ni , steep declines suggest more overlying mass .",
    "this trend is also evident in the light curves calculated by rls , who parametrize the slope at various epochs in their table 3 .",
    "the separation of wd065 and onemg from hed6 after 200@xmath9 is due to the earlier survival of positrons in wd065 and onemg .",
    "figure [ fam1000 ] is an extension of figure [ fam400 ] to 1000@xmath9 , but including the curves from positron trapping scenarios .",
    "this epoch emphasizes the differences in positron transport between the field geometries .",
    "the most noticeable feature is that the radial models are approximately equivalent and steep , whereas the trapping models flatten according to the percentage of @xmath0ni produced in the outer portions of the sn .",
    "rls mention that the late light curves of trapping field scenarios flatten relative to instantaneous deposition , but state that the effect is small .",
    "our results show the effect to be large .",
    "thus , the 400@xmath9 -800@xmath9 , positron - dominated epoch is a diagnostic of field characteristics , not of model types . also apparent in this figure",
    "is that the `` massive '' models show separation between the field scenarios much later and to a lesser degree than the rest of the models .",
    "massive in this sense refers to a large mass of slow ejecta overlying the @xmath0ni - rich zones .",
    "the variety of shapes at early epochs and then the dramatic separation between the predictions of positron trapping in a turbulent field geometry and positron escape in a radial or weak field show that 60@xmath9 and later bolometric light curves yield a wealth of information as to the structure and dynamics of the sn ejecta .",
    "ideally , to probe the sn structure using light curves , model - generated bolometric light curves are compared with observed bolometric light curves . observed bolometric light curve reconstructions , to date , are at best based on measurements in the u , b , v , r , i bands , with some information from the j , h and k bands .",
    "as the sn dims , the photometric uncertainties increase and for many light curves , the number of bands observed decreases , leading to less accurate bolometric reconstructions .",
    "we use the available bolometric light curves : sn 1992a to day 420 ( suntzeff 1996 ) , sn 1991bg to day 220 ( turratto et al . 1996 ) , sn 1972e to day 420 ( axelrod 1980 ) , wide spectrum to be too uncertain ] sn 1989b to day 135 , and sn 1991 t to day 108 ( suntzeff 1996 ) . the best epoch to observe positron transport effects is during the 500@xmath9 -900@xmath9 range ; only sn 92a and sn 72e extend close to that epoch . nonetheless , the sn 91bg , sn 89b and sn 91 t light curves are valuable in checking the fit of a specific model during the gamma - dominated phase . for each model",
    "we consider for a particular event , we simply fit the calculated light curve to the `` observed '' bolometric light curve . thus we avoid the uncertainties in distance , extinction , and bolometric correction .",
    "we then show the later , positron - dominated light curves relative to this fit for comparison to the more limited data in one or a few bands .",
    "rls fit models to the bolometric luminosities of sn 1991bg and sn 1992a , mazzali et al .",
    "( 1996 ) fit sn 1991bg . in sections 5.1 5.2 and 5.4",
    "we will discuss our results in relation to theirs .    when there is insufficient data to reconstruct bolometric light curves we compare model bolometric shapes to individual band photometry .",
    "this assumes that at late epochs there is little color evolution",
    ". we must be able to rule out any increasing shift of the luminosity into unobserved bands .",
    "lira ( 1998 ) showed that the collective tendency is for the color indices stop evolving after day 100 - 120@xmath8 . in figure 10",
    "we show the u , b , v , r , and i band variations of six of the sne used in this study .",
    "b - v peaks around t@xmath6730 - 40@xmath8 , then decreases to approximately zero near day 100 ( except sn 1991bg ) . at the ( b - v )",
    "peak , the v band contains most of the energy and then declines to b - v @xmath67 0 with the b band a potentially important contributor .",
    "the v band is the best single band to trace the supernova bolometric light curve .",
    "the five bolometric light curves permit us to estimate the error introduced by fitting with only the v band .",
    "as shown in figure 11 , the inaccuracies in using the v or b band data for the bolometric luminosity are @xmath100.2@xmath68 during the 60@xmath8 - 120@xmath8 epoch . the similar procedure in comparing model - generated bolometric light curves to band photometry was also employed by capp who used v band data for every epoch .",
    "theoretical arguments about color evolution have been made by axelrod and colgate ( 1996 ) , who disagree as to whether collisional or radiative processes dominate the emission from the recombination cascade .",
    "the competition between collisional and radiative processes hinges upon three factors : level of ionization ( temperature in the collisional scenario ) , density , and atomic cross sections .",
    "fransson & houck ( 1996 ) addressed these issues , calculating multi - band model light curves .",
    "the technique worked well for the type ii sn 1987a , but the type ia light curves generated from the model dd4 showed a sharp decrease in u , b , v , r , i around day 500 due to the infrared catastrophe ( irc ) , and were inconsistent with sn 1972e . why the irc does not apparently occur in sn ia is something of a puzzle .",
    "the model dd3 contains more @xmath0ni ( 0.93 m@xmath69 versus 0.62 m@xmath69 for dd4 ) and thus maintains a higher level of ionization .",
    "this delayed the onset of the irc , but still could not fit the observed light curves of sn 72e .",
    "it is important for our discussion that any onset of the irc is abrupt ; this does not lead to a gentle decline of the light curve as we find for positron escape .",
    "fransson & houck ( 1996 ) also considered clumping in the ejecta .",
    "it might delay the onset of the irc for the inter - clump regions , but it hastens its onset in the clumps .",
    "it remains to be seen if spectra modeled with clumping will reproduce the observed spectra .",
    "the atomic cross sections provide a third explanation for the lack of color evolution .",
    "if the radiative transition probabilities are underestimated , the radiative scenario might dominate .",
    "fransson & houck increased the recombination rates by a factor of 3 to model the spectra ; perhaps additional adjustments are required .",
    "few of the sne observed at late epochs show convincing color evolution .",
    "two of the three sne that continue to evolve after 120@xmath9 , 1986 g and 1994d , seem to settle into constant color indices later .",
    "all the evidence suggests to us that the v ( and probably b ) band tracks the bolometric luminosity of sn ia at late times .",
    "we emphasize the sne for which there are at least two measured bands for most of the observed light curve .",
    "the amount , type , and quality of data varies among sne .",
    "a summary of the observations used in this study are listed in table [ sumobs ] .",
    "a wider range of model fits to sne is shown in milne ( 1998 ) .",
    "we primarily consider sn ia models shown by others to describe well the early light curves and/or spectra of particular well - observed events , calculating their light curves to late times .",
    "models are considered for a given event if they can reproduce some combination of the following features : distance - dependent peak luminosity estimates , rise - time to peak luminosity and peak width , early spectral features and light curve shapes for multiple color bands .",
    "generally the early data available do not uniquely define the model parameters , or even the basic type of model .",
    "for some cases , the suggested models are quite different .",
    "an example of this is sn 1991bg , which is fit with two low - mass models ( an 0.6 m@xmath69 aic and a 0.65 m@xmath69 hedet ) , a 1.4 m@xmath69 pulsed model and a 1.4 m@xmath69 deflagration model .",
    "our first test is whether a model can fit the earlier nebular light curve , which probes the transition from gamma to positron domination .",
    "we then examine whether models that pass this first test can determine the magnetic field configuration and degree of ionization .",
    "thus , this study is able to add another constraint to the sn fitting puzzle , as well as determining if positrons escape from sn ejecta .",
    "sn 1992a occurred in the s0 galaxy ngc 1380 and was observed extensively .",
    "it is often held up as an example of a normal sn ia .",
    "extinction appears to be minimal , making sn 1992a an excellent candidate for photometric analysis .",
    "sn 1992a is one of three sne treated in both rls and capp .",
    "we show the fits of three models to sn 1992a : dd23c , m39 and hed8 .",
    "dd23c was fit on the recommendation of peter hflich ( 1998 ) , and also because kirshner et al .",
    "( 1992 ) fit the spectral data with a modified version of dd4 , which is similar to dd23c .",
    "rls combined the distance estimates to ngc 1380 with suntzeff s uvoir bolometric estimation to suggest that the peak bolometric luminosity was between 42.65 and 43.00 dex .",
    "this suggests that a sub - luminous model might be required .",
    "m39 is a delayed detonation that has a peak bolometric luminosity of 43.06 .",
    "we choose it as a compromise between the delayed detonation scenario suggested by the spectra , and the low luminosity suggested by distance estimates .",
    "capp listed the distance to ngc 1380 as 16.9 mpc , with e(b - v ) = 0.00@xmath70 , and fit the data with a 1.0 m@xmath69 model which produced 0.4 m@xmath69 of @xmath0ni .",
    "we instead use the similar model hed8 .",
    "figure [ bol92a ] shows the fits of dd23c and hed8 to the bolometric light curves of sn 1992a . for this object",
    "the bolometric light curves are reconstructed to late enough times that we can use them directly to study positron energy input . assuming a 0.025 dex uncertainty for each data point , dd23c provided the best fit , varying only the overall amplitude , of the suggested models in the 55420@xmath9 epoch , fitting with 81% confidence for the radial curve .",
    "the trapping version of that model was rejected at the 99.91% confidence even when renormalized .",

    "the capp fit for 7 @xmath10 @xmath46 @xmath10 10 remained too bright from 20@xmath9320@xmath9 , also in agreement with our results .",
    "the best fitting class of models were the delayed detonation models ; w7 , det2env6 and pdd54 were the only models other than delayed detonation models to fit at better than the 20% confidence level .",
    "we show the fits of two models to the v data , dd23c and m39 , in figure [ v92a ] .",
    "both models follow the falling luminosity better with positron escape than with trapping .",
    "fitting time - invariant ionization scenarios to the v data with the published uncertainties , none of the models provided a fit better than @xmath72/dof=18 .",
    "the numerical fits to the v band data ( table 2 ) show that with the scatter in excess of the stated uncertainties , none of the models provide statistically acceptable fits . in absolute terms , our goodness - of - fit statistics are questionable , but the fits are better for radial scenarios for almost every model .",
    "the other delayed detonation models yielded fits similar to dd23c and m39 for the v data , demonstrating that the observation of positron escape at late times is not strongly model - dependent .",
    "the 928@xmath9 point might herald the onset of another source of power .",
    "possibilities include other radioactivity , such as @xmath73na or @xmath55ti ( but not @xmath54co , which is too weak ) , recombination energy lagging earlier , higher ionization input ( clayton et  al . 1992 , fransson & kozma 1993 ) , and positrons encountering circumstellar material , as well as others . in summary for sn 1992a : delayed detonations are the most promising model types , all of which overproduce the late light v light curves without escape of positrons .",

    "their light curve assumed positron trapping and was too bright to fit the data after 110@xmath9 .",

    "ten sne were analyzed , including super- and subluminous events , reddened and unreddened sne , old ones recorded on photographic plates and recent sne recorded on ccds .",
    "of the ten , five show strong evidence of positron escape ( 92a , 37c , 91 t , 72e , 90n ) , three others are also consistent with significant positron escape but somewhat ambiguous , ( 93l , 86 g , 94d ) , and for two others it was not clear which model actually described the early light curve and should be tested for its positron transport later ( 91bg , 89b ) . only sn 1989b suggests the possibility that a trapping field may provide a better fit , and there are complications with that interpretation . as a group , the supernova light curves fall more quickly than models , which fit well at early times , extrapolated to later times with all the positron kinetic energy deposited in and radiated by the ejecta .",
    "this is consistent with the escape of a substantial fraction of the positrons emitted by @xmath0co after one year .",
    "regarding even earlier times , for sub - luminous sne the chandrasekhar mass models fit the light curves better than low - mass models . for normally luminous sne , there are not enough observations from 60@xmath9400@xmath9 to choose between the model masses",
    ". the superluminous sne can apparently be fit equally well by high - mass he - detonation models and nickel - rich chandrasekhar mass models .",
    "table 3 shows the positron survival fraction of type ia sne at 2000@xmath9 and the resulting positron yields for all the models treated in this study .",
    "the range of values reflects the extremes of ionization fractions .",
    "the lower values correspond to triple ionization , the higher values are for 1% ionization .",
    "the yields vary between the two extremes by roughly a factor of three .",
    "the observations suggest that 1% ionization typically fits better , so we will quote 2/3 of that yield as a conservative estimate for each model . for radial fields ,",
    "the chandrasehkar mass models have a lower survival fraction when compared with equally luminous sub - chandrasehkar mass models , but the larger nickel mass partially compensates for that fact . as a result , for all but the  heavy \" models , the yields are not strongly dependent upon model mass .",
    "the radial scenarios have greatly enhanced positron escape yields compared to the trapping scenarios .",
    "positron escape is best observed best in light curves when its relative effect is large , between 400@xmath9 & 1000@xmath9 , but the positron yield in absolute terms is determined earlier : 80% of the escaping positrons do so between 178@xmath9 -546@xmath9 for w7 ( 94@xmath9 -492@xmath9 for hed8 ) .",
    "it is conceivable , but probably not common , that the trapping field could apply until , say , 500@xmath9 , when the field magnitude decreased to the point that the larmor radius reached the ejecta radius and the object would cross over to the field - free regime .",
    "the  release time \" for a positron of a given energy is proportional to the initial field strength , which might vary over many orders of magnitude . for one object",
    "we might incorrectly infer the positron escape for this reason , but not likely for many .",
    "the positrons that escape retain a significant fraction of their emitted energy , as shown by cl and in figure [ emit ] , which compares the emission spectrum ( dashed line ) to the escape spectrum ( solid line ) . with energies near 400 kev , the positrons have a considerable lifetime in the ism , giving diffuse galactic 511 kev emission .",
    "to estimate the rate of positron injection into the ism , we assume a 2:2:1 ratio of normal : subluminous : superluminous sne .",
    "considering dd23c , pdd3 , and hed8 , a reasonable yield for normal sne is 8 x 10@xmath78 positrons . for subluminous",
    "sne , pdd54 , det2env6 suggest a yield of 4 x 10@xmath78 positrons . from w7dt , dd4 , and hecd ( suggested by 91 t )",

    "an estimate of the uncertainty in this flux can be obtained by inserting d=7.7 -8.5 kpc , y=3 -10 e+ sn@xmath4 , snr=0.003 -0.06 sn yr@xmath4 , and @xmath84=0.5 -0.65 ( corresponding to a positronium fraction of 1.0 -0.9 ) into the formula .",

    "the flux is on the order of the galactic bulge component of the 511 kev flux as measured by osse .",

    "we calculate the @xmath6-ray and the positron kinetic energy deposition to produce `` ubvoir '' bolometric light curves for the time when the photon diffusion time ( t@xmath160@xmath8 ) is short for various models of type ia sne . in calculating positron kinetic energy deposition into the ejecta",
    ", we calculate it for particular extreme environments , they are : radial magnetic field , turbulence magnetic field , and field free geometries in a 1% and triple ionization medium throughout the evolution . the deposited energy rate is assumed to instantaneously appear as `` ubvoir '' bolometric luminosity and is compared with several observed bolometric luminosity",
    "when they are available or with b and v bands observed luminosity . in this work",
    ", we analyzed ten late time type ia supernova light curves by comparing the light curves with the calculated light curves .",
    "it can be shown clearly , that all of the light curves except of sn 1991bg ( explain below ) require positron kinetic energy deposition in order to give a reasonable agreement . without the energy deposition ,",
    "it is quite obvious that the light curve is too dim to explain the observe light curve at t@xmath1200@xmath8 ( colgate , petschek , kreise 1980 ; capellaro et al .",
    "1997 ; ruiz - lapuenta & spruit 1997 ) .",
    "we show @xmath6-ray energy deposition at t@xmath160@xmath8 can hardly be used to distinguished light curve shape between various models , except to differentiate between extreme models such as between low ( pdd1b ) and high explosion energy models or between low sub - chandrasekhar mass ( i.e. onemg ) and chandrasekhar mass ( i.e. w7 ) models .",
    "a similar situation also ensues in the epoch when positron kinetic energy deposition is dominant and for the case of magnetic field in the ejecta being radially combed outward . in the case of turbulence magnetic field , the usefulness of the late time light curve to differentiate models is moderately improved due to the effectiveness of ejecta to slow down and to absorb the kinetic energy of positrons .",
    "the light curves of sn ia are dominantly powered by the kinetic energy deposition from @xmath16 decay of positrons after the nebula becomes optically thin to gamma photons . before and at the onset of this `` positron phase '' the positrons have short lifetimes regardless of the field geometry , but as the nebula becomes more tenuous positrons can survive and possibly escape for favorable geometries . the longer",
    "the positrons stay as energetic particles , the larger is the deficit of energy deposition relative to the full instantaneous energy deposition .",
    "this effect is also observed when there are more positrons escape from the ejecta . comparing late time light curves of suggested models from early light curve and spectra for particular observed supernovae",
    ", the deficit of luminosity relative to instantaneous deposition can be seen in the b and/or the v band light curves of sne 1992a , 1990n , 1937c , 1972e , 1991 t .",
    "the phenomena give the evidence that positron take its time in depositing its kinetic energy and possibly moves quite far from its origin and even escapes from the ejecta .",
    "further detail comparisons of the calculated light curves of positron energy deposition in radial and tangled magnetic field configurations of type ia models with the observed v and b band light curves show that the radial field configuration ( or synonymously the weak field configuration ) produces a better agreement than does the tangled magnetic field configuration , which produces light curves far too flat .",
    "the agreement that requires radial field configuration is exhibited by the observed light curves of sn 1992a , sn 1937c , sn 1990n , sn 1972e , and sn 1991 t .",
    "models with tangled magnetic field configuration produce a flatter and brighter light curves than the radial field configuration due to the more energy deposition .",
    "there are a number of potential sources which can flatten the curves further , but steepening the curves such as by irc is difficult without color evolution , which to date has not been observed in sn ia light curve .",
    "these facts strengthen the argument that positron escape occurs in sn ia ejecta .",
    "fitting observed light curves of sn 1993l , sn 1994d , and sn 1986 g give ambiguous results that it is not clear which of the radial or the tangled magnetic configuration model can give acceptable fit .",
    "the ambiguity is mostly due to the fluctuation in the observed b and v band light curves .",
    "the strongest indication for the tangled magnetic configuration seems to be shown by the sn 1989b observed light curve , however there is a possibility that there is a contribution from a light echo at late times .",
    "sn 1991bg is somewhat a special case that not all sn 1991bg observed light curves agree with each other completely .",
    "two light curves ( turatto et al . 1996 ; filippenko et al .",
    "1992 ) agree with each other , but no model that we have can give a reasonable fit to the light curves unless we unphysically impose no positron kinetic energy deposition in the ejecta .",
    "the light curve observed by leibundgut et al . ( 1993 ) can be fit reasonably well with model pdd54 and w7 , but we can not determine the magnetic field configuration in the ejecta because of no observation done by leibundgut et al .",

    "based on the shape of sn 1937c , sn 1972e , and sn 1992a s light curves , which all follow the predictions of the radial field configuration model , we conclude that in these supernovae the positrons escape with the most efficient transparency as if the positrons moved in a straight line from their origins to the surface and deposit a minimum of their kinetic energy as they escape .",
    "these supernovae show that type ia sne can be a dominant source of the diffuse galactic 511 kev line fluxes .",

    "<S> we generate bolometric light curves for a variety of type ia supernova models at late times , simulating gamma - ray and positron transport for various assumptions about the magnetic field and ionization of the ejecta . </S>",
    "<S> these calculated light curve shapes are compared with light curves of specific supernovae for which there have been adequate late observations . from these comparisons </S>",
    "<S> we draw two conclusions : whether a suggested model is an acceptable approximation of a particular event , and , given that it is , the magnetic field characteristics and degree of ionization that are most consistent with the observed light curve shape . </S>",
    "<S> for the ten sne included in this study , five strongly suggest @xmath0co positron escape as would be permitted by a weak or radially - combed magnetic field . of the remaining five sne , </S>",
    "<S> none clearly show the upturned light curve expected for positron trapping in a strong , tangled magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> chandrasekhar mass models can explain normally , sub- , and super- luminous supernova light curves ; sub - chandrasekhar mass models have difficulties with sub- ( and potentially normally ) luminous sne . </S>",
    "<S> an estimate of the galactic positron production rate from type ia sne is compared with gamma - ray observations of galactic 511 kev annihilation radiation . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we emphasize the importance of correctly treating the positron transport for calculations of spectra , or any properties , of type ia sne at late epochs ( @xmath1 200 d ) . </S>"
