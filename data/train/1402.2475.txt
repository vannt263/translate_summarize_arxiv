    "in this paper we consider a relaxed version of the classical notion of proper coloring of a graph .",
    "we are interested in vertex colorings of graphs with the property that each color class consists of the disjoint union of ( connected ) components of bounded size .",
    "these components are said to be _ monochromatic _ , and the _ size _ of a monochromatic component is its number of vertices .",
    "a proper coloring is the same as a coloring in which every monochromatic component has size 1 , so by allowing monochromatic components of larger size , one expects that the minimum number of colors needed might decrease significantly .",
    "for instance it was proved by haxell , szab and tardos  @xcite that every graph with maximum degree at most @xmath3 can be 2-colored in such a way that all monochromatic components have size at most 20000 ( such graphs have chromatic number as large as 6 ) .",
    "it was conjectured by hadwiger that every graph with no @xmath4-minor has a proper coloring with @xmath5 colors .",
    "the case @xmath6 was shown to be equivalent to the famous 4 color theorem , which states that every planar graph has a proper 4-coloring .",
    "on the other hand , it was proved by kleinberg , motwani , raghavan , and venkatasubramanian  @xcite , and independently by alon , ding , oporowski and vertigan  @xcite that there is no constant @xmath7 such that every planar graph has a 3-coloring in which every monochromatic component has size at most @xmath7 .",
    "more generally , for every @xmath8 , there are graphs with no @xmath4-minor that can not be colored with @xmath9 colors such that all monochromatic components have size bounded by a function of @xmath8 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "it follows that the bound predicted by hadwiger s conjecture ( and proved for @xmath10 ) on the chromatic number of a graph with no @xmath11-minor is best possible , even in our relaxed setting .    in this paper",
    "we prove that the bound can be significantly decreased in the specific case of graphs embeddable on surfaces of bounded genus .",
    "given a graph @xmath12 , a @xmath13-list assignment @xmath14 ( for the vertices of @xmath12 ) is a collection of lists @xmath15 , @xmath16 , such that each list contains at least @xmath13 elements . given a list assignment @xmath14 , an @xmath14-coloring @xmath7 of @xmath12 is the choice of an element @xmath17 for each vertex @xmath16 . unless stated otherwise , such a coloring is not necessarily proper .",
    "it was proved by thomassen  @xcite that for every planar graph @xmath12 and every @xmath3-list assignment @xmath14 , the graph @xmath12 has a proper @xmath14-coloring .",
    "we will prove that the same holds from any graph embeddable on a surface of genus @xmath1 , provided that monochromatic components are only required to have size bouned by @xmath2 ( theorem  [ th : g3col ] ) .",
    "the fact that cliques of order @xmath18 can be embedded on such surfaces shows that the size of monochromatic components has to depend on @xmath1 .",
    "moreover we will show that we can find a list - coloring in which all vertices except @xmath2 of them lie in monochromatic components of size at most 3 .    a theorem of grtzsch  @xcite states that every triangle - free planar graph has a proper 3-coloring .",
    "esperet and joret  @xcite proved that there exist no constant @xmath7 such that every triangle - free planar graph has a 2-coloring in which every monochromatic component has size at most @xmath7 .",
    "hence , it follows again that grtzsch s theorem can not be improved even in our relaxed setting .",
    "we will show however that every triangle - free graph embeddable on a surface of genus @xmath1 can be colored from any 3-list assignment , in such a way that all monochromatic components have size @xmath2 , and all vertices except @xmath2 lie in a monochromatic component of size at most 10 ( theorem  [ th : g4col ] ) .",
    "the case of triangle - free graph is particularly interesting because voigt  @xcite proved that there exists a triangle - free planar graph @xmath12 and a 3-list assignment @xmath14 such that @xmath12 is not @xmath14-colorable .",
    "so our result is non - trivial ( and previously unknown , as far as we are aware of ) even in the case of planar graphs .",
    "the _ girth _ of a graph @xmath12 is the smallest size of a cycle in @xmath12 .",
    "we will also show that every graph of girth at least 6 embeddable on a surface of genus @xmath1 can be colored from any 2-list assignment , in such a way that all monochromatic components have size @xmath2 , and all vertices except @xmath2 lie in a monochromatic component of size at most 16 ( theorem  [ th : g6col ] ) .",
    "all these results are direct consequences of purely structural results on ( large ) graphs embeddable on surfaces of bounded genus . given a graph @xmath12 , a _",

    "large graphs of girth at least 6 and bounded genus have a 1-island of size at most 16 ( theorem  [ th : g6island ] ) .",
    "the proofs of these three results use the discharging method and are very similar , but unfortunately each one has some particularities and therefore we have not been able to factorize them .    in section  [ sec : complex ] , we study the computational aspects of minimizing the size of monochromatic components in 2-colorings of graphs .",
    "we show that approximating this minimum within a constant multiplicative factor is np - hard , even when the input graph is a 2-degenerate graph of girth at least 8 , or a 2-degenerate triangle - free planar graph .",
