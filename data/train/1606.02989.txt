    "our aim is to study the effect of the addition of a self - interaction mechanism to two initially markovian dynamics .",
    "the first one is the classical fokker - planck diffusion @xmath0 that solves the sde @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a standard brownian motion on @xmath3 .",
    "namely @xmath4 is the markov process with generator @xmath5 we recall the generator of a markov process @xmath6 is formally defined by @xmath7 the second one is the velocity jump process @xmath8 which is the piecewise deterministic markov process ( pdmp ) introduced in @xcite with generator @xmath9 where @xmath10 is constant and @xmath11 denotes the positive part ( see @xcite and section [ sectionhittingpdmp ] for a trajectory definition of the dynamic ) . in both cases , if we suppose that the potential @xmath12 is sufficiently coercive at infinity , @xmath4 is ergodic and its law converges to the gibbs measure with density proportional to @xmath13 . note that when the rate of jump @xmath14 goes to infinity and time is correctly accelerated , the velocity gibbs process ( more precisely its first coordinate ) converges to the fokker - planck diffusion ( see @xcite ) .    in both cases we want to replace the potential @xmath15 by a self - interacting potential @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a symmetric interaction potential . in other words",
    "@xmath18 depends both on the current position @xmath19 and the ( non - normalized ) occupation measure @xmath20 .",
    "this is a strong self - interaction , by contrast with the weak self - interaction such as studied in @xcite where the self - interacting potential is a function of @xmath19 and of the normalized occupation measure @xmath21 .",
    "self - interacting processes belong to the family of _ path - dependent _ processes .",
    "the particularity of such processes is their lack of markov property since the past modifies the environment that drives the particle .",
    "new phenomena may arise in their long time behaviour , which would be impossible without the path - dependency .",
    "a first example of strong self - interaction is the linear one , that correspond to @xmath22 .",
    "m.cranston and y.le jan proved in 1995 ( see @xcite ) the almost sure convergence of the solution of the sde @xmath23 later , s.herrmann and b.roynette extended this result to a broader class @xmath24 with @xmath12 convex ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in the case of the circle , the first author obtained the same result for @xmath25 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in all these cases the particle is attracted by its past .    in @xcite ,",
    "m.benam and the first author considered the repulsive case , in which the particle is repelled by its past trajectory .",
    "more precisely they studied a self - repelling diffusion on a compact manifold where @xmath17 can be decomposed as @xmath26 with the @xmath27 s being positive numbers and the @xmath28 s being eigenfunctions of the laplace operator on the manifold .",
    "the basic example on the circle would be @xmath29 .",
    "this assumption on the @xmath28 s yields an explicit formula for the invariant measure of the markov process @xmath30 .",
    "the aim of the present work is to investigate the case where the @xmath28 s are not eigenfunctions of the laplace operator . on the other hand",
    "we restrict the study ( in dimension 1 ) to the case @xmath31 , namely we take a potential of the form @xmath32 with moreover @xmath33 smooth and @xmath34-periodic , so that we consider @xmath35 .",
    "following @xcite , we set @xmath36 which reduces the study of the non - markovian process to the study of some markov process on an extended space .",
    "this restriction should be seen as a first step toward the analysis of the more general situation .    as a consequence , in this paper we study",
    "the markov processes @xmath37 on @xmath38 and @xmath39 on @xmath40 with respective generators @xmath41 and @xmath42 in both cases we call @xmath4 the position , @xmath43 the auxiliary variable and , in the case of the velocity jump process , @xmath44 the velocity .",
    "we work under the following assumption :    * the function @xmath45 is non - constant , smooth , changes signs , and @xmath46 implies @xmath47 .",
    "moreover for all @xmath48 there exists @xmath49 such that @xmath50 .",
    "in particular the critical points of @xmath33 are isolated points .    throughout this paper",
    ", we consider the discrete sets @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "recall the total variation distance between two probability laws @xmath53 and @xmath54 is @xmath55 and a measure @xmath53 is said invariant for a markov process @xmath6 if @xmath56 implies @xmath57 .",
    "we say that the law of @xmath6 converges exponentially fast to @xmath53 in the total variation sense if there exist @xmath58 , that may depend on the law of @xmath59 , such that @xmath60 our main result is the following :    [ thmprincipal ]    1 .   if @xmath61 , then each of the the processes @xmath37 with generator and @xmath39 with generator admits a unique invariant measure . if the law of @xmath62 admits an exponential moment then the process converges exponentially fast in the total variation distance sense to this invariant measure . 2 .",
    "if @xmath63 , then , in both cases , the position @xmath19 almost surely converges as @xmath64 goes to infinity to a point of @xmath65 .",
    "any point of @xmath65 has a positive probability to be the limit of @xmath4 .    before proceeding to its proof ,",
    "let us mention why this result may be expected .",
    "suppose that , at some time , @xmath66 .",
    "then , as long as @xmath43 is large enough , the force @xmath67 tends to confine @xmath4 close to the minima of @xmath33 .",
    "if these minima are all negative , while @xmath4 stays in their neighbourhood , @xmath43 decreases , up to some point where it becomes negative . from then the effect of the force",
    "is reversed , @xmath4 is attracted by the maxima of @xmath33 , and the same mechanism comes into play with @xmath43 and @xmath33 changed to @xmath68 and @xmath69 . in some sense @xmath4 and @xmath43 have then an inhibitory effect one on the other .    on the other hand if @xmath4 falls in the neighbourhood of a positive minimum of @xmath33 while @xmath66 ( the case of a negative maximum with @xmath70 being symmetric ) then , as long as it stays there , @xmath43 increases , which make it more and more unlikely for @xmath4 to escape away from the minimum , so that eventually there is a positive probability that @xmath4 never leaves and @xmath43 goes to infinity",
    "this is reminiscent of the annealing problem ( see @xcite for the diffusion and @xcite for the velocity jump process ) where @xmath71 is replaced by a deterministic @xmath72 , called the inverse temperature .",
    "it is classical that in this case , if @xmath73 increases faster than logarithmically then @xmath4 will eventually stay trapped forever in the cusp of a local minima . yet , in our present case , as long as @xmath4 stays close to a positive minimum , @xmath43 increases linearly in time .    1 .",
    "the particular form of the interacting potential @xmath74 implies that @xmath17 is a mercer kernel , which means the particle is repulsed by its past ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we could also consider the case @xmath75 .",
    "following the proof of theorem [ thmprincipal ] , it is not hard to see that in this case @xmath19 almost surely converges as @xmath64 goes to infinity to a point of @xmath76 which , as soon as @xmath33 is not constant and changes signs , is non - empty .",
    "if @xmath33 does not change signs , then , depending on the sign , @xmath71 converges either to @xmath77 or to @xmath78 linearly fast .",
    "therefore , proposition [ prophitting ] and proposition [ proplocal ] imply the almost - sure convergence of @xmath19 respectively either to a local minimum or to a local maximum of @xmath33 .",
    "we made the choice to write as much as possible notations , results and proofs which are common to both processes , isolating only the few lemmas that deal with the specific technical difficulties of each case .",
    "our arguments are based on bounds for some hitting times of the processes which are established in section  [ sectionhitting ] . from them",
    "we show in section  [ sectiontemps ] that , when @xmath65 is empty , the time for the processes to return to compact sets is short ( i.e. in a time with exponential moments ) .",
    "section [ sectiondensite ] is devoted to some uniform bounds of the transition kernel of the processes over compact sets , and section [ sectionpreuve ] to the proof of theorem [ thmprincipal ] .",
    "in this section , for a redaction purpose , we will hide the dependency on @xmath43 of the evolution of @xmath4 .",
    "more precisely we will consider the ( inhomogeneous in time ) diffusion @xmath79 for any lipschitz function @xmath80 and , similarly , the inhomogeneous pdmp @xmath81 with generator @xmath82 where the generator of an inhomogeneous markov process @xmath83 is by definition @xmath84 note the processes considered in theorem [ thmprincipal ] are particular cases of those defined here .",

    "the aim of this section is to prove the following :    [ prophitting ] there exist a constant @xmath119 and nonnegatives random variables @xmath120 and @xmath121 with some finite positive exponential moments , such that for all @xmath122 and @xmath123 $ ] with @xmath124 , for all lipschitz function @xmath125 , if @xmath4 is defined by or if @xmath81 is defined by the generator , the following holds : @xmath126    in the case of the velocity jump process @xmath81 , note that these bounds are uniform over the initial velocity @xmath127 .",
    "the meaning of these bounds is the following .",
    "suppose the auxiliary variable @xmath43 ( whose role here is played by an arbitrary function @xmath80 ) stays for some time above a given level @xmath122 . then the position @xmath4 will fall in a local minima of @xmath33 within a time shorter than @xmath120 , which does not depend on @xmath128 ( i.e. a high @xmath43 can only accelerate the hitting time of @xmath100 ) .",
    "then to climb back up to an intermediary point of @xmath129 , it takes a time @xmath130 , which is again uniform on @xmath122 . from @xmath129 ,",

    "the proof of proposition [ prophitting ] is split in the two next subsections since the arguments are different for each dynamic .",
    "note that in several proofs we will make assumptions like @xmath133 where @xmath134 and @xmath135 are in @xmath136 , which will make sense since at these times we will only be concerned by the behaviour of the processes on given simply connected intervals of @xmath136 .",

    "since , again , the arguments are different for both processes , we split the proof of proposition [ propnoyau ] in two paragraphs .      in this subsection",
    "we consider the process @xmath263 induced by the generator ( [ modelediff ] ) , namely the solution of the sde @xmath338    [ densitediff ] for all @xmath339 and @xmath281 , the transition kernel @xmath340 admits a smooth density with respect to the lebesgue measure and its support is @xmath341 $ ]",

    ", we simply approximate the case @xmath428 in the previous step by sufficiently fast and balanced jumps between @xmath429 and @xmath430 .",
    "finally , we consider the pdmp starting from @xmath303 .",
    "since the random jump times have positive density , the pdmp follows arbitrarily closely a trajectory as described in the second step with positive probability .",
    "hence , given any neighbourhood of @xmath384 , the pdmp has positive probability to be in it at time @xmath186 , which concludes .",

    "according to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.4 ) , it implies there exist a non - empty open set @xmath437 , a probability measure @xmath54 and @xmath438 such that @xmath439 , @xmath440 thus for any @xmath393 and any borel set @xmath336 , @xmath441 and lemma [ lemcontrolepdmp ] concludes .",
    "in this section we consider either @xmath263 or @xmath264 such as in theorem  [ thmprincipal ] , and we call @xmath329 the state space , namely either @xmath330 or @xmath331 .",
    "let @xmath442 where @xmath128 is large enough so that proposition [ proprecurrent ] holds , and @xmath443 .",
    "let @xmath444 and @xmath445 the boundary @xmath446 being compact and the processes being feller , the embedded markov chain @xmath447 admits an invariant measure @xmath448 .",
    "for a borel set @xmath336 , @xmath449 defines a measure which is invariant for @xmath83 ( see ( * ? ? ? * proof of theorem 4.1 ) ) , and has finite mass ( the expectation of @xmath450 being bounded uniformly on @xmath451 from proposition  [ proprecurrent ] ) , which we suppose normalized to 1 .",
    "note that from the controllability results proven in section [ sectiondensite ] , the support of @xmath53 is equal to @xmath329 .",
    "the uniqueness of the invariant measure and the exponential convergence to equilibrium are both obtained from a classical coupling argument .",
    "let @xmath452 , and let @xmath453 and @xmath202 be given by proposition [ propnoyau ] .",
    "wait until the time @xmath266 ( which according to proposition  [ proprecurrent ] is almost surely finite , and moreover , has a finite exponential moment if so does @xmath454 ) . at time @xmath266",

    "if @xmath456 ( which happens with positive probability ) , we define simultaneously two processes @xmath83 and @xmath457 with the same generator ( either or ) in such a way that @xmath458 with probability @xmath202 , in which case we say the coupling is a success and from then we let @xmath457 evolve according to its markov dynamics ( i.e. either the diffusion or the pdmp one ) and set @xmath459 for all @xmath460 .",
    "if the coupling is a failure ( which happens with probability @xmath461 ) , we wait until @xmath83 enters @xmath462 again .",
    "note that at time @xmath463 , @xmath83 is necessarily at most at distance @xmath464 from @xmath332 , hence its next time of return to @xmath332 has some finite exponential moments that do not depend on @xmath454 .",
    "once @xmath83 has reached @xmath332 we try a new coupling , and so on as long as the coupling fails .",
    "let @xmath465 be the first instance the coupling succeeds .",
    "since @xmath53 is invariant for the dynamics , @xmath466 is a coupling between @xmath467 and @xmath53 , and @xmath468 uniqueness of the invariant measure is obtained by taking @xmath469 invariant .",
    "moreover , if @xmath454 has some finite exponential moments , so does @xmath465 , and the chernoff s inequality concludes : @xmath470      [ proplocal ] suppose @xmath472 .",
    "then there exist @xmath473 and @xmath300 ( which does not depend on @xmath59 ) such that if @xmath474 and @xmath475 , then @xmath476    for @xmath477 , define @xmath478 set @xmath479 and @xmath480 and define the following stopping times : @xmath481 let @xmath482 and @xmath483 .",
    "let us give some intuition on these definitions .",
    "the connected component of @xmath484 that contains @xmath144 is a neighbourhood of @xmath144 whose diameter goes to 0 as @xmath485 goes to @xmath77 . at time @xmath486 , the process has escaped from this neighbourhood . for @xmath487 ,",
    "the process makes possibly many oscillations near @xmath144 .",
    "when such an oscillation is large enough for the process to reach @xmath488 ( this is at a time @xmath489 for some @xmath490 ) , we consider this is the beginning of an attempt to leave @xmath484 .",
    "if this attempt fails , the process falls back to @xmath144 ( this is @xmath491 ) .",
    "while @xmath4 makes those attempts to escape , time goes by , so that @xmath43 increases : after a time @xmath202 , @xmath43 has increased at least by 1 .",
    "next time @xmath4 falls back to @xmath144 ( this is @xmath492 ) , we shrink the neighbourhood , namely from then we consider that the process escapes if it reaches @xmath493 . from @xmath494 to @xmath492 , there have been @xmath495 attempts to leave .",
    "the sequence @xmath132 is scaled so that there is in fact a positive probability that the process never escape from the shrinking neighbourhood that collapses at infinity to @xmath496 .",
    "let us write these ideas more precisely .",
    "note that as long as @xmath497 , @xmath498 for @xmath499 .",
    "we take @xmath128 large enough so that @xmath500 for all @xmath501 . therefore , from proposition [ prophitting ] , for all @xmath49 , @xmath502 it implies that @xmath503 is a submartingale .",
    "thus , @xmath504 from proposition [ prophitting ] , we have @xmath505 hence , considering a sequence @xmath506 of i.i.d random variables distributed like @xmath121 @xmath507 because @xmath121 satisfies a large deviation principle , @xmath508 for some constant @xmath509 which does not depend on @xmath485 , nor @xmath128 .",

    "yet , @xmath517 and the @xmath494 s are all a.s .",
    "finite , which concludes .",
    "the proof even gives a speed of convergence .",
    "indeed we can see that @xmath518 , so that the @xmath494 s grow linearly to infinity . from the non - degeneracy assumption on @xmath33",
    ", there exist @xmath519 and @xmath520 such that the diameter of @xmath521 is less than @xmath522 , depending on the first derivative of @xmath33 at @xmath144 to be non - zero ( if @xmath33 is a morse function , @xmath523 ) .",
    "it means when there is convergence , it occurs at least at a speed of order @xmath524 .    first note that by changing @xmath43 and @xmath33 to their opposites , proposition [ proplocal ] also says that if @xmath525 then there exist @xmath526 such that if @xmath527 and @xmath528 then @xmath19 converges to @xmath144 with probability at least @xmath194 .    for @xmath300 large enough , @xmath180 small enough and @xmath529 ,",
    "let @xmath530 when @xmath182 is fixed , for @xmath128 large enough , if the process starts in @xmath531 , from inequality ( which is written for @xmath532 but by symmetry , again , also holds for @xmath533 ) it has a probability at least @xmath534 to hit @xmath535 before leaving @xmath536 .",
    "then from proposition [ proplocal ] , @xmath4 has a probability at least @xmath194 to converge to @xmath90 .",
    "let @xmath537    as long as the process is in the complementary of @xmath538 , the conclusion of proposition  [ proprecurrent ] ( together with remark [ larem ] ) holds so that , denoting by @xmath539 the first hitting time of a set @xmath336 , we have @xmath540 for all @xmath541 ( more precisely : suppose @xmath542 , the case @xmath527 being symmetric .",
