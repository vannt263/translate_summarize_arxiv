    "the investigation of the quark gluon plasma created in relativistic heavy - ion collisions relies on a fruitful interplay between theory and experiment .",
    "hence the availability of observables that are both experimentally accessible as well as theoretically amenable is of importance .",
    "the first unambiguous sign for the creation of a deconfined and strongly interacting state of matter , reported by the rhic experiments phenix@xcite and star@xcite , e.g. relied on the occurrence of collective flow@xcite and the quenching of jets @xcite in @xmath0 collisions at @xmath1 .",
    "early on , matsui and satz@xcite proposed another type of hard probe , the bound states of heavy quarks . from analogies with the electromagnetic plasma",
    ", they concluded that a debye screened potential above the deconfinement temperature would not be able to support the formation of a @xmath2 bound state .",
    "this in turn would lead to a suppression of the measured abundance of heavy quarkonia in the presence of a quark - gluon plasma .    while heavy quarkonium suppression has indeed been confirmed@xcite by several experiments , it turns out , that the physics of charmonium in relativistic heavy - ion collisions is rather involved .",
    "cold nuclear matter effects , as well as final state effects , such as recombination and feed - down mask the actual influence of the thermal medium on the stability of the bound state .    in the case of @xmath3 , which became measurable with adequate statistics , once the lhc commenced its runs at @xmath4 ,",
    "the connection is much cleaner . produced in the hard partonic stage at the beginning of the collision",
    ", bottomonium does not suffer from significant recombination effects nor is there appreciable feed - down from @xmath5 .",
    "the dimuon spectra measured by the cms collaboration@xcite furthermore provided clear evidence for the suppression of the excited states in @xmath6 collisions compared to their abundances in @xmath7 . under these conditions",
    "heavy quarkonium becomes an ideal candidate to investigate the physics of melting bound states , which will be our focus in the rest of this brief review .",
    "ever since matsui and satz , the goal for theory has to be to put their phenomenological arguments onto a solid first - principles basis . in the past",
    "many attempts relied on a time independent notion of the melting process , introducing purely real model potentials and investigating their ability to support a bound state of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "popular candidates were the color singlet free energies @xmath10@xcite , the color singlet internal energies @xmath11@xcite and even linear combinations of both quantities@xcite .",
    "while these quantities can be readily extracted from lattice qcd correlation functions at a single time step @xmath12 , a direct connection to a schroedinger equation derived from first principles qcd is unlikely to exist@xcite .",
    "in a situation where the heavy quarkonium is produced inside the quark - gluon plasma , e.g. through recombination , questions about the possibility of bound state formation can lead to insight .",
    "bottomonium however is created before the qgp thermalizes and we need to understand its real - time evolution inside the medium to eventually grasp the physics of its suppression .    an essential step into this direction was the discovery by laine et.al.@xcite that the heavy quark potential at first non - trivial order in resummed perturbation theory not only shows debye screening but also features an imaginary part .",
    "its appearance was subsequently attributed to the phenomenon of landau damping@xcite .",
    "first corrections to these results in the context of effective field theory were presented in@xcite introducing further contributions to both real and imaginary part .",
    "these findings remind us that a static notion of a well defined bound state above the deconfinement temperature becomes devoid of meaning and urge us to devise a fully dynamic approach to the stability and melting of heavy quarkonium instead .",
    "let us begin by asking how a non - relativistic schroedinger equation with instantaneous potential can be consistently derived from the underlying field theory of qcd .",
    "what makes heavy quarkonia particularly suitable to theoretical treatment is the inherent separation of scales between its constituent mass@xcite @xmath13 and other typical scales in relativistic heavy ion - collisions .",
    "compared to e.g. the temperature of the deconfinement transition @xmath14 , the intrinsic scale of qcd @xmath15 and the typical momentum exchange in the bound state @xmath16 , we find @xmath17 this in turn tells us that neither thermal nor quantum fluctuations can spontaneously pair create a heavy @xmath8 and @xmath9 and thus a non - relativistic description can be attempted .",
    "whenever there exists a hierarchy of scales , effective field theory ( eft ) provides a general framework on how to reduce the complexity of the description by treating explicitly only the physics at the energy scales of interest .",
    "( for a review of the technique applied to qcd at t=0 see refs.@xcite and references therein . ) in our case the physics of the bound state is well separated from the hard scale @xmath18 , which we hence wish to integrate out .",
    "the notion of  integrating out  encompasses three actions : first we need to identify the relevant degrees of freedom at the energy scale of interest ; secondly the most general lagrangian in these new variables is to be constructed while retaining the symmetries of the underlying field theory .",
    "last but not least , the residual influence of the higher lying energy scale is incorporated through the process of matching , where suitable correlation functions in the original and effective language are made to agree at a certain energy scale .",
    "the first step on the path towards a heavy quark potential thus lies in applying the above concepts to qcd .",
    "we begin by integrating out the hard scale , which leads us to the effective field theory nrqcd .",
    "the starting point is the qcd lagrangian @xmath19 written in terms of matrix valued gauge fields @xmath20 , light medium quarks @xmath21 and heavy quark fields denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "as the physics below the hard scale does not involve pair creation of heavy quarks , the upper and lower components of the dirac spinor @xmath22 themselves suffice to capture the relevant physics and we proceed to separate @xmath23 and @xmath24 by means of a foldy - tani - wouthuysen ( ftw ) transformation@xcite .",
    "the resulting nrqcd lagrangian presents itself as a series of terms of increasing powers in the inverse heavy quark mass @xmath25 , the first few of which read@xcite @xmath26 note that in addition to the transformation of fields , we have inserted so called wilson coefficients @xmath27 in each term that scales explicitly with a power of @xmath25 .",
    "these complex numbers encode the remnants of the physics at higher energy scales , such as e.g. a possible contribution of a gluonic cloud to a kinetic mass of the quarks via @xmath28 .",
    "one difference to the usual nrqcd approach is that here we do not integrate out gluons and light quarks with hard momenta , as we assumed @xmath29 and our aim is to explicitly incorporate their contribution through the use of non - perturbative lattice qcd simulations . for our purpose of deriving a static and spin - independent potential",
    ", we can safely set all values of @xmath27 to unity in the following .",
    "( for further information on the explicit determination of the @xmath27 s through matching we refer the reader to ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the strength of the ftw transformation is to yield a systematic expansion in the inverse rest mass , which at the same time alerts us to the limits of any potential picture derived via nrqcd . since after summing up an infinite number of terms , the underlying qcd lagrangian emerges , couplings between the upper and lower components @xmath24 and",
    "@xmath23 will necessarily reappear at some order and the absence of explicit pair creation is not guaranteed .",
    "the first relevant terms , such as @xmath30 indeed appear at order @xmath31 , signaling the break down of the non - relativistic approximation at higher orders .",
    "the notion of potential has so far not found entry into the description of the dynamics , as the pauli spinor fields @xmath23 and @xmath24 interact via the explicit mediation of the gauge fields @xmath32 .",
    "one possibility to introduce @xmath33 is to integrate out all degrees of freedom down to the so called soft scale , characterized by energies @xmath34 .",
    "the wilson coefficients in this approach are non - local and represent potentials between well defined color singlet and octet configurations of the heavy quarks .",
    "termed pnrqcd , this effective field theory allows a consistent power counting and the choice of degrees of freedom in the form of correlated pairs of heavy quarks has proven successful at zero temperature@xcite as well as in in - medium applications@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in the quark - gluon plasma we expect the heavy quark bound states to melt eventually and thus ultimately our description should comprise as relevant degrees of freedom also decorrelated pairs of individual heavy quarks .",
    "the question remains how to describe the heavy quark bound state while emphasizing the propagation of its individual constituents ?",
    "one possible way is to turn to non - relativistic path integrals@xcite , which operate with point particles@xcite along fluctuating trajectories @xmath35 and their conjugate momenta @xmath36 .",
    "in particular they will allow us to to read off the interaction potential by applying the transfer matrix prescription to the complex weighting factor @xmath37 $ ] of a two - body path integral .",

    "if a potential picture were applicable at all times , we expect to be able to rewrite the expression as an exponential over a time independent function @xmath52 .",

    "now that the field theory of qcd in form of the real - time wilson loop has been connected to a non - relativistic potential description of heavy quarkonia in eq . , we have to ask how the actual values of such a potential can be determined in practice .",

    "one novel possibility to , at least qualitatively , elucidate such non - perturbative qgp physics is the gauge - gravity duality@xcite . by mapping a certain type of strongly coupled conformal yang - mills theory to a weakly coupled classical field theory in higher dimensions , calculations that are technically impossible in the former can actually be carried out in the latter .",
    "this approach has recently been used@xcite to determine the values of the thermal real - time wilson loop and subsequently the static potential according to the definition eq .. while the obtained real part at small distances shows coulombic behavior , at large distances it exhibits a rather long tail , whose value decreases with increasing temperature . the imaginary part on the other hand while being zero up to a threshold @xmath61 runs linearly in distance already dominating the real part at relatively short @xmath62 .    in the following",
    "we investigate the non - perturbative aspects of heavy - quarkonium physics , while staying firmly within the framework of qcd .",

    "last but not least , we should extend the strategy reviewed here to measurements of the wilson loop in the context of dynamical qcd , where significant effects of deconfined light quarks to the screening of the real part and strength of the imaginary part are expected .",
    "the previous sections have shown that the static inter - quark potential in the deconfined phase most certainly exhibits an imaginary part .",
    "we might ask how such an apparent non - hermiticity can be interpreted in the context of the in - medium evolution of the heavy - quark bound state . to this end",

    "this goes so far that after some time , changes in one particle do not influence the state of the other . at this point",

    "does not possess a notion of thermal fluctuations , one necessarily goes over to an ensemble of wavefunctions @xmath116 so that the corresponding density matrix of states in the subsystem can be expressed as @xmath117=\\langle \\psi_{q\\bar{q}}({\\bf r},t)\\psi_{q\\bar{q}}^*({\\bf r}',t)\\rangle \\label{eq : qqdensmat}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by definition , decoherence in this context represents the phenomenon that the interactions with the surroundings select a certain basis of states in the @xmath39 system in which the density matrix @xmath118 becomes diagonal after the decoherence time @xmath119 has passed . to make as close contact as possible with the potential extracted from lattice",
    "qcd , we will however study the influence of the interaction with the thermal medium directly on the level of the wavefunction .    in sec.[sec",
    ": qmpi ] we connected the spectral features of the wilson loop to a complex potential . here",
    "we take a different route@xcite as indicated in fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "the intuitive idea is that the thermal fluctuations , i.e. light quarks and gluons in the qgp , will perturb the potential acting between the heavy @xmath8 and @xmath9 at each step in the time evolution .",
    "the average of this purely real potential @xmath120 corresponds to what was previously called @xmath99 $ ] , while its variance is to be connected to the width of the spectral features .",
    "based on this paradigm , let us set out to construct a fully unitary time evolution operator@xcite for each microscopic realization of the wavefunction @xmath116 in the ensemble @xmath121\\psi_{q\\bar{q}}({\\mathbf r},0)\\label{eq : stochtimeevol}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the sake of simplicity we restrict ourselves to a markovian noise term @xmath122 , which however carries a non - trivial spatial correlation structure @xmath123 characterizing the thermal properties of the qgp medium .",
    "an equation of motion for the heavy quarkonium is obtained once the operator of eq .",
    "is expanded following the rules of stochastic differential ito calculus @xmath124 at this point we are in possession of a stochastic schrdinger equation that preserves the norm of each individual wavefunction of the ensemble while introducing decoherence in the physical heavy quarkonium state , as seen from taking the average @xmath125 thus within this open quantum systems approach , the imaginary part of the eft approach emerges naturally from the diagonal correlations of the thermal fluctuations . on the other hand , extracting the imaginary part of the eft potential from lattice qcd allows us to pinpoint parts of the noise structure of the qgp .    to describe the suppression of heavy quarkonia",
    ", we have to state first what it is that we measure in experiment . naively speaking ,",
    "when heavy quarkonium is created in the partonic stage of a collision , it appears as eigenstate @xmath126 of a vacuum hamilton operator @xmath127 . after entering the qgp",
    ", the stochastic evolution will lead to a reshuffling of states but the particle we finally observe in the detector is still a vacuum eigenstate . hence we wish to ask how probable it is to find such a vacuum state after a certain time of evolution in the thermal medium , a question , which is answered by the following projection @xmath128 since this quantity is connected to the density matrix of states introduced in eq .",
    "it will be susceptible also to the off - diagonal elements in @xmath129 in contrast to the averaged wavefunction of eq .. by observing the time evolution of @xmath130 we are confident to learn , within the limitations of the non - relativistic approach , whether and how a heavy quark bound state melts as it evolves in a thermal medium .",
    "conversely by comparison with experimental suppression data , one might attempt to infer properties of the qgp itself .",
    "obviously we are only at the beginning of a thorough understanding of the open quantum systems nature of heavy quarkonium .",
    "one immediate question is e.g. how to extract not only the diagonal but also the off - diagonal components of @xmath129 from lattice qcd .",
    "a more fundamental challenge to the presented approach is the fact that we use a static potential to describe heavy but finite mass quarks in eq .. as was recently shown in a perturbative rederivation and generalization@xcite of the real - time dynamics inspired by the feynman vernon influence functional@xcite , we are missing a crucial element .",
    "in fact , dissipation , without which the heavy quarks can never thermalize , must be included to obtain e.g. consistent ehrenfest relations .",
    "once thermalization has been achieved it will be of interest to compare the resulting distribution of states to the spectral functions from htl perturbation theory@xcite and lattice qcd@xcite .",
    "in addition , a possible route to include explicit color degrees of freedom has been presented@xcite , a feature we require to allow the heavy quarkonium to melt consistently into its constituents .",
    "further studies in this direction should be undertaken as they open the way towards a consistent description of both single heavy quarks and their bound states in the qgp .",
