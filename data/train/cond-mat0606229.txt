    "it is noteworthy that as @xmath16 is decreased from 80  k , the @xmath79 curve shows a sudden drop down to @xmath80 at @xmath2 , indicating that the whole sample enters into an ic - af state .",
    "as @xmath16 decreases from @xmath2 , @xmath81 , which measures the distribution of @xmath33 in the ic - af phase , rapidly decreases down to @xmath40.8  mhz at 40  k , then seems to level off the lowest value down to @xmath420  k and then increases with increasing slope ( @xmath82d@xmath81/d@xmath83 ) until it reaches 4  mhz at 1.9  k. the overall @xmath16 dependence of @xmath81 is similar to that of @xmath84 .",
    "this behavior is expected since a large @xmath81 naturally implies a more inhomogeneous field distribution i.e , an increased flattening of the ellipse that enhances @xmath84 .",
    "the asymmetry of the ic magnetic phase , @xmath62+@xmath63 , also increases monotonically with decreasing @xmath16 , although a small jump likely exists around 20  k. the existence of a significant @xmath62 underscores the inappropriateness of fitting the zf-@xmath3sr data with only a @xmath42 term .",
