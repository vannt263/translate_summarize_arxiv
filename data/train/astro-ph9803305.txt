    "the launch of the bepposax satellite @xcite in 1996 has led to a recent breakthrough in the study of gamma - ray bursts by detecting fading x - ray counterparts and localizing them to a few arc - minutes on the sky .",
    "this has allowed subsequent identification of optical counterparts in three cases , grb970228 @xcite , grb970508 @xcite , and grb971214 @xcite .",
    "grb971214 triggered the bepposax gamma ray burst monitor on december 14.97272 ut with a peak flux of 650 counts s@xmath5 .",
    "in addition , the burst was localized to an error radius of @xmath6 ( 99% confidence ) with the wide field camera @xcite .",
    "the gamma - ray event was also detected by batse which measured a total fluence above 20 kev of @xmath7 erg @xmath8 and by one rxte - asm camera yielding a peak intensity of @xmath9 mcrab @xcite .",
    "shortly thereafter , a fading optical source was detected within the bepposax error circle at @xmath10@xmath11 , @xmath12@xmath13 with i - band magnitudes of @xmath14 on dec 15.47 ut and @xmath15 on dec 16.47 ut @xcite .",
    "further observations by bepposax detected a previously unknown fading x - ray source , later designated 1sax j1156.4 + 6513 , within the initial error circle at @xmath16 , @xmath17 with an error radius of about @xmath18 @xcite . since this second x - ray detection is consistent with the position of the fading optical source identified by halpern et al .",
    "( 1997 ) it is quite likely that these objects are the x - ray and optical afterglow of grb971214 .",
    "we report here @xmath0-band and @xmath1-band observations of this optical transient ( ot ) made with the apache point observatory(apo ) 3.5 m telescope .",
    "this work extends the preliminary photometry reported in diercks et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , castander et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and tanvir et al .",
    "the field of grb971214 was imaged on the four consecutive nights following the burst , with the first observations taking place 13 hours after the bepposax detection .",
    "the optical transient was positively detected each night .",
    "all observations were taken with a thinned site 2048 ccd through an @xmath0-band filter at @xmath19 binning yielding a plate scale of @xmath20 pixel@xmath5 .",
    "the images were overscan subtracted and flat - fielded with twilight flats in the usual manner using iraf @xcite .",
    "the field of grb971214 is plagued by the presence of a bright star hd103690 ( @xmath21 ) which contributed a substantial amount of stray light to the images . in order to optimally combine the images",
    ", we removed this stray light by median filtering each frame with a 14@xmath22 rectangular box and then smoothing the resulting image with a 18@xmath22 fwhm gaussian filter .",
    "the spatially varying part of each smoothed image was then subtracted from its corresponding flat - fielded image to remove the excess stray light . as the variations were typically less than 10%",
    ", the effect on the noise computations due to slightly lower sky values in certain regions of the images was quite small .",
    "all the images for each night were aligned and combined , weighting each frame by the photon noise within a seeing disk .",
    "the epoch quoted for each measurement is average of the time of each observation weighted in the same manner .",
    "the four final images are shown in figure  [ fig-1 ] .",
    "the ot discovered by halpern is clearly visible in our december 15.51 data and has sufficient signal to fit an accurate centroid using dophot @xcite .",
    "we measure a position of @xmath10@xmath23 , @xmath12@xmath24 for the ot with an uncertainty of @xmath25 using five nearby stars in the usno - a1.0 catalog @xcite .",
    "all subsequent photometry on both the ot and comparison stars was done using dophot with these positions fixed as it resulted in greater precision especially in the later data where the ot is quite faint .    in order to test the robustness of our detection in the december 18.50 ut data where the ot is close to the detection limit",
    ", we performed fixed position psf photometry on 50 arbitrary regions within the image . in only one case was there sufficient signal to fit a psf , and the returned magnitude was at the detection limit of the image .",
    "we are therefore confident in our detection of the ot in the december 18.50 data .",
    "we observed the field pg0918 + 029 @xcite and the field of grb971214 on 1998 february 1 under photometric conditions with the same camera and filter arrangement used to monitor the ot .",
    "observations were made over a range of airmass from 1.18 to 2.32 and we derived an average r - band extinction of @xmath26 mag airmass@xmath5 .    using this coefficient we obtained calibrated magnitudes for five stars in the field of grb971214 which are listed in table  [ tbl-1 ] and shown in figure  [ fig-1 ] .",
    "star 3 was saturated in some of the monitoring data and was not used for calibration purposes . using the remaining stars , we normalized the monitoring data to obtain the absolute photometry of the ot on each night .",
    "the lightcurve for the four days following the burst is shown in figure  [ fig-2 ] along with the lightcurves of the ots associated with grb970228 @xcite and grb970508 @xcite for comparison .",
    "we also imaged the grb971214 field with the grism spectrometer and imager ii ( grim ii ) in the j band on the first two nights after the burst .",
    "the grim ii instrument has a nicmos array , which at f/5 provides a pixel scale of 0.47@xmath22 and a field of view of @xmath27 .",
    "we obtained dithered 10-second exposures , totaling 730 and 1150 seconds on the first and second nights , respectively .",
    "images were dark - current and bad - pixel corrected , flat - fielded and combined , with high sigma threshold clipping , into a single image for each night .",
    "the mean time of the resulting exposures were december 15.44 and 16.45 ut , respectively .",
    "we detect the ot at a magnitude of @xmath28 on december 15.44 and @xmath29 on december 16.45 , where the calibration is performed using observations of the ukirt faint standard star fs12 , carried out at several airmasses .",
    "table  [ tbl-2 ] summarizes both the @xmath0-band and @xmath1-band observations .",
    "the well - observed light curve of the grb970508 ot , the brightest observed thus far , shows a dramatic rise , peaking nearly two days after the initial burst , before beginning a power - law decay .",
    "grb970228 was not observed nearly as often through a consistent filter , but there is also evidence ( depending on spectral assumptions ) @xcite that the transient increased in brightness until @xmath30 hr after the burst , after which it also began fading with a power - law slope essentially identical to that of grb970508 .",
    "despite the same decay slope , the grb970228 ot was @xmath31 mag fainter than the grb970508 ot .",
    "a detailed analysis of the difference between these two light curves is presented in pedersen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "a power - law of the form @xmath32 was fit to the four @xmath0-band data points yielding @xmath2 .",
    "this rate of decline is similar to the two previously identified bursts although there is no evidence of the ot brightening over the course of the observations .",
    "the observations from all four nights are combined into one deep image totaling 3.25 hrs of integration with a limiting @xmath0-band magnitude @xmath33 ( figure  [ fig-3 ] ) .",
    "the two brightest objects within 20@xmath22 of the ot are an extended source ( a ) @xmath34 southwest of the transient with @xmath35 , and an unresolved source ( b ) @xmath36 north of the transient with @xmath37 .",
    "the resolution of these images is insufficient to identify any structure in the extended object .",
    "we would like to thank jan van paradjis and the bepposax team for their critical help in making our early observations of grb971214 possible .",
    "we would also like to thank bruce margon , christopher stubbs , and eli waxman for useful and informative discussions .",
    "these observations were made on very short notice and involved last - minute technical changes which would not have been possible without the enthusiastic cooperation of the apo site staff .",
    "we thank daniel reichart for pointing out an error in the ut times of the apo @xmath0-band observations in a pre - print of this paper , which when corrected , yield a slower rate of decline .",
    "ad acknowledges the generous support of the david and lucille packard foundation .",
