    "the numi off - axis @xmath2 appearance experiment ( no@xmath0a ) @xcite is the flagship project of fermilab s intensity frontier initiative and will study the appearance of electron neutrinos or antineutrinos using the numi neutrino beam produced at fermilab .",
    "no@xmath0a is a next generation neutrino oscillation experiment with a baseline of 810  km .",
    "the beam is measured by a near detector ( nd ) about 1  km downstream of the beam production target and a far detector ( fd ) placed 810  km away in ash river , minnesota .",
    "the detectors are positioned 14  mrad ( 0.8 ) off the numi beam axis so that the expected neutrino beam energy spectrum is a narrow band peak at 2  gev near the oscillation maximum .",
    "this yields a dramatic reduction of backgrounds in @xmath2 appearance searches .",
    "no@xmath0a will study @xmath3 oscillations in the numi neutrino beam .",
    "the beam is created from collisions of 120  gev protons , accelerated by the main injector facility at fermilab , with a graphite target . to meet",
    "the no@xmath0a physics goals , the numi beam will be upgraded from a nominal power of 400  kw to 700  kw of beam power .",
    "this will be achieved by reducing the cycle time of the main injector from the present 2.2  s to 1.3  s via slip - stacking in the recycler ring ; increasing the intensity per cycle with 12 booster batches instead of 11 by installing new rf stations and a new injection kicker magnet ; and upgrading the target and horns to accommodate the increased proton intensity .",
    "there will be a 10  @xmath4s beam spill every 1.33  s as a result .",
    "the upgrades will be carried out during the scheduled march 2012 shutdown of the fermilab accelerator facilities and will result in an intensity of 4.9 x 10@xmath5 protons per pulse , corresponding to a total 6.0 x 10@xmath6 protons on target ( pot ) accumulated per year of running . from pion decay kinematics , we know the neutrino energy will depend on the characteristic decay angle @xmath7 between the neutrino and the parent pion in the lab frame . as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : neutrinoe ] , for @xmath7 = 14  mrad most pion decays result in neutrinos with e = 2  gev , with some energy smearing around that value .",
    "therefore , the no@xmath0a detectors placed 14  mrad off the numi beam axis will measure a narrow band beam peaked very near the @xmath3 oscillation maximum at 810  km ( e @xmath81.6 gev ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : neutrinoe2 ] .",
    "the narrow beam energy spectrum strongly reduces the background from feed - down of higher energy neutral - current ( nc ) neutrino events , the dominant background for @xmath3 oscillation searches with the detectors placed on - axis .",
    "the no@xmath0a detector system consists of a near and far detector constructed 14  mrad off - axis to the numi source .",
    "the detectors are functionally identical , allowing for cancellation of systematic uncertainties due to neutrino flux and cross - section modeling .",
    "both detectors are highly segmented tracking calorimeters built entirely from low z ( @xmath80.15 radiation lengths per layer ) , highly reflective ( 15% tio2 ) pvc cells with a 65% active volume @xcite .",
    "the pvc cells are filled with liquid scintillator ( mineral oil infused with 5% pseudocumene ) .",
    "each cell is 3.8  cm by 5.9  cm in cross section with 90% reflectivity for light at 430  nm .",
    "sixteen cells are extruded together as a single part .",
    "two extrusions are joined together by an end seal and manifold cover to produce a sealed module of 32 cells .",
    "the orientation of the cells alternates between vertical and horizontal to allow for 3d event reconstruction .",
    "the scintillation light is collected by a loop of wavelength shifting fiber in each cell and read out by 32-pixel avalanche photo - diodes ( apds ) .",
    "the apds have 85% quantum efficiency , operate at a gain of 100 and are cooled to -15  c to reduce dark noise to less than 2 photoelectrons .",
    "the detectors are optimized for detection of @xmath2 charged - current ( cc ) interactions , with fine sampling of the characteristic electromagnetic showers ( 1 layer = 0.15 x@xmath9 , molire radius = 10  cm ) .",
    "the nd will have a mass of 222  ton and will be placed underground , in a new cavern to be excavated next to the minos @xcite experiment nd hall , @xmath8 1  km away from the beam production target .",
    "excavation of the underground cavern for the near detector will begin following the beam shutdown .",
    "the nd will observe a cosmic rate of 50  hz and will see approximately 30 neutrino events per beam spill .",
    "the much larger fd will have a mass of 14  kton and will be located at the surface in ash river , minnesota , 810  km away .",
    "the relative size of the two detectors is apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig : relsize ] and the scale of the experiment is highlighted by superimposing the far detector in chicago s soldier field as in fig .",
    "[ fig : soldierfield ] .",
    "the fd will have a cosmic rate of approximately 200  khz and will see on the order of 50 @xmath2 charged - current signal events per year .",
    "the fd building at ash river includes a mound of barite rock 3  m earth - equivalent overburden of more than ten radiation lengths to reduce cosmic backgrounds .",
    "the fd pvc blocks will measure 15.6  m in height by 15.6  m in width .",
    "the total length of the detector will exceed 63  m. the fd pvc modules will be assembled and tested in a large warehouse at the university of minnesota and assembled into 32-layer blocks at ash river .",
    "beneficial occupancy of the fd building was obtained in april 2011 and the power and network infrastructure is in place .",
    "figure  [ fig : fardetview ] is an aerial view of the completed far detector building .",
    "the first fd block is expected to be installed during january 2012 .    a far detector site in ash river , minnesota.,width=510 ]",
    "no@xmath0a will be able to distinguish @xmath2-cc interactions from backgrounds very effectively due to the low - density and high granularity of its detectors .",
    "topologies for different categories of events simulated in the no@xmath0a detectors are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mc_events ] .",
    "the main backgrounds are expected to originate from nc events where a @xmath10 is produced and from the intrinsic beam @xmath2 component .",
    "the @xmath10 background events can be identified if spatial gaps are apparent near the event vertex and/or the event contains multiple displaced electromagnetic showers created by the two photons the @xmath10 decays into . the intrinsic beam @xmath2 component can be estimated from the beam simulation and nd measurements .    a detectors for @xmath11 cc , @xmath2 cc and nc with @xmath10 production neutrino interactions.,width=302 ]    no@xmath0a is sensitive to electron neutrino appearance down by an order of magnitude of the limit set by the chooz @xcite experiment at 90% cl .",

    "contours for different beam upgrades are also shown with an assumed 18 x 10@xmath6 pot of data in each neutrino and antineutrino mode .",

    "may resolve the mass hierarchy if @xmath1 is large enough .",
    "figure  [ fig : massh ] shows no@xmath0a s resolution of the normal ( left ) and inverted ( right ) neutrino mass hierarchy respectively at the 95% c.l .",
    "no@xmath0a will also be able to signicantly improve the precision on the measurements of atmospheric neutrino oscillation parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "minos reported a @xmath82@xmath20 difference between best fit values for @xmath0 and @xmath17 disappearance parameters in their 2010 @xmath21 analysis @xcite .",
    "no@xmath0a would be able to confirm ( at more than 3@xmath20 ) or rule out the asymmetry between @xmath18 and @xmath22 hinted at by minos with 1 year of neutrino running and 1 year of antineutrino running .",
    "no@xmath0a could establish this difference at the 5@xmath20 level after the full 6 year run , 3 + 3 years in neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "this is reflected in fig .",
    "[ fig : contours ] .",
    "it should be noted that minos recently released new antineutrino oscillations results @xcite whereby they include an increased antineutrino data exposure .",

    "the difference is set to coincide with the recent difference reported by minos at 2@xmath20 c.l @xcite .",
    "contours are based on three years of neutrino running and three years of anti - neutrino running and use quasi - elastic events.,width=510 ]",
    "the near detector on the surface ( ndos ) is the prototype near detector .",
    "it is functionally identical to the nd and has been operating on the surface at fermilab and taking neutrino data since october 2010 .",
    "the ndos location at fermilab has been chosen so that it is simultaneously exposed to the numi neutrino beam ( 110  mrad or 6.4off - axis ) and the booster neutrino beam ( @xmath8 on - axis ) .",
    "the ndos was built to mimic far site construction as closely as possible .",
    "building the ndos allowed the factories and collaboration to fully exercise their quality assurance / quality control ( qa / qc ) techniques in preparation for full production running for the far detector .",
    "this process revealed that @xmath822% of the manifold covers cracked after assembly into a block .",
    "these covers have been repaired and a new more robust design with more rigorous control has been adopted for future production . furthermore , oil work allowed us to gain experience qualifying the scintillating oil and filling the detector modules with the oil . surface cleanliness and sealing issues have led to many of the ndos apds becoming unusably noisy .",
    "274 installed apd units have been removed from the ndos detector for cleaning and study .",
    "the collaboration is investigating new surface coating and installation techniques which will alleviate these issues prior to far detector construction .      at peak performance ,",
    "the ndos ran warm with 75% of its available channels readout . at the time of writing only 45% of the detector",
    "is live . despite this , the ndos provides extremely valuable preparation for construction at ash river .",
    "it also has allowed us to have an early look at real cosmic rays and neutrinos and ultimately given us a headstart on calibration techniques and physics analyses .",

    "the color corresponds to hits belonging to the same track and the line indicates the fit result of the cosmic ray reconstruction algorithm .",
    "the reconstructed cosmic rays are used for commissioning , detector alignment , calibration and stability studies .",
    "the cosmic ray reconstructed tracks have been utilised to calibrate corrections for the differences in signal pulse heights from tracks going through cells at different distances from the apd sensors caused by fiber attenuation .",
    "figure  [ fig : adc ] shows the result of measuring the path - length corrected muon response for an example cell and then the effect of applying calculated attenuation corrections to produce a calibrated muon response for the cell .",

    "ndos has collected 5.6 x 10@xmath23 pot worth of data in reverse horn current beam and 8.4 x 10@xmath24 pot in forward horn current mode from numi . a subsequent analysis of this sample has yielded 1001 and 253 candidate neutrino events with 69 and 39 expected cosmic background events respectively .",
