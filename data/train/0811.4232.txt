    "knowledge of the properties of the equation of state ( eos ) of hot asymmetric nuclear matter is of fundamental importance to understand the physical mechanism of the iron core collapse of a massive star which produces a type - ii supernova , and the rapid cooling of a new born hot neutron star .",

    "eos and properties of dense neutron - rich matter is available at the accelerator facility at gsi , and in future , will be also available through the high - energy radioactive beams at the planned facility for rare isotope accelerator ( fria ) @xcite .",
    "there is a wealth of existing literature regarding the eos of supernova matter @xcite .",
    "supernova matter which exists in a collapsing supernova core and eventually forms a hot neutron star at birth is another form of nuclear matter distinguished in the participation of degenerate neutrinos and electrons @xcite .",
    "it is characterized by almost constant entropy per baryon @xmath1 ( in units of the boltzmann constant @xmath2 ) throughout the density @xmath3 and also by a high and almost constant lepton fraction @xmath4 in contrast with ordinary neutron star matter where @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "these characteristics are caused by the effects of neutrino - trapping which occurs in the dense supernova core where a neutron star is formed .",
    "this paper is a continuation of our previous work concerning the eos of hot @xmath0-stable nuclear matter in cases where neutrinos have left the system @xcite .",
    "more specifically , in order to study the properties and the eos of hot nuclear matter , a momentum - dependent effective interaction model ( mdim ) has been applied , one which is able to reproduce the results of more microscopic calculations of dense matter at zero temperature and which can be extended to finite temperature @xcite .",
    "the main incentive for the present study is the fact that only few calculations of the equation of state of the supernova matter at high densities are available , although at lower densities ( @xmath7 ) ( where @xmath8 @xmath9 is the saturation density ) reliable results are already available . for our purposes , we have applied a model which , in comparison to previous models , has the specific property that the temperature affects not only the kinetic , but also the interaction part of the energy density . in this way , we are able to simultaneously study thermal effects on the kinetic part of the symmetry energy and symmetry free energy , in addition to the interaction part of the above quantities @xcite .",
    "this is significant in the sense that the density dependent behavior of the symmetry energy and symmetry free energy strongly influence the values of the proton fraction and as a consequence the composition of hot @xmath0-stable nuclear matter .",

    "it has been speculated that matter at densities up to about @xmath10 may be present in the core collapse of type - ii supernova @xcite .",

    "proto - neutron stars are identified as a final stage of a supernova collapse . at this stage , a proto - neutron star is hot and composed of the so - called supernova matter .",
    "in addition , we examine the two findings of the previous work of takatsuka et al . @xcite concerning supernova matter .",
    "the first one is concerned with the finding that the population of the components is remarkably constant both in baryon density @xmath3 and temperature @xmath11 and the proton fraction @xmath12 is very large ( e.g. , @xmath13 for @xmath14 ) in contrast with that of neutron star matter .",
    "the second one concerns the finding that the eos of dense supernova matter is by far stiffer than that of neutron star matter and correspondingly , hot neutron stars at birth are not only `` fat '' but hot as well compared to usual cold neutron stars .",
    "we broaden our study further by examining the influences of the temperature on the stiffness of eos compared to the cold case .",

    "the most striking aspect is that the lepton energy , @xmath175 , dominates in the internal energy of the matter up to @xmath176 @xmath9 ( for @xmath149 ) and @xmath177 @xmath9 ( for @xmath14 ) .",
    "this is a characteristic of the supernova matter and is in remarkable contrast with the situation of cold neutron star matter @xcite .",
    "the contribution from baryon @xmath173 gets larger with the increase of @xmath3 and is comparable with @xmath174 for high values of @xmath3 .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the above situation depends on the combination of the stiffness of nuclear equation of state ( values of incompressibility and density dependent behavior of the nuclear symmetry energy ) and the lepton fraction .",
    "nonetheless , the main feature is unaltered , especially up to low values of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the contribution on the lepton energy , as is presented in fig .  8 , originates mainly from electrons while neutrino contribution is smaller ( but not negligible ) .",
    "the present results for the electron and neutrino energy per baryon , can also be accurately reproduced , at least for low values of @xmath11 , by applying the analytical formula used by onsi _",
    "@xcite where the energy density @xmath178 and energy per baryon @xmath174 of the leptons are given by @xmath179 @xmath180 in eqs .",
    "( [ en - den - ele ] ) and ( [ en - den - neut ] ) , @xmath181 and @xmath182 are constants .    the contributions of baryon and leptons on the total pressure are presented in fig .",
    "in contrast to the situation of the internal energy , the nuclear part contribution plays a more important role compared with the lepton part . the lepton pressure @xmath183",
    "is comparable to baryon pressure @xmath184 up to @xmath185 @xmath9 , but for higher values of @xmath3 it is significantly small .",
    "what is more , the main part of @xmath183 originates from electrons compared to neutrinos as presented in fig .  10 .    as pointed out by bethe et al .",
    "@xcite , the crucial feature in determining the evaluation of a collapsing pre - supernova core is that the entropy per particle is very low , of the order of unity ( in units of the boltzmann constant @xmath2 ) , and nearly constant during all the stages of the collapse up to the shock wave formation .",
    "therefore , the collapse is an adiabatic process of a highly ordered system .",
    "so , since the supernova matter is characterized by a constant entropy and constant lepton fraction , we shall also discuss the properties under this condition .",
    "this can be done by converting the results for isothermal case ( @xmath11=const ) into those for adiabatic case ( @xmath74=const ) in terms of the @xmath186 relation constrained by a constant entropy .",
    "the @xmath187 relation is constructed by @xmath188 values to satisfy @xmath83=const in an @xmath189 diagram .",
    "11 shows the results for @xmath149 and @xmath14 for @xmath190 .",
    "temperature is an increasing function of @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , for the same density , the temperature is higher for lower values of @xmath146 .",
    "the values of @xmath11 for various values of @xmath3 are derived , for the two cases , with the least - squares fit method and found to take the general form @xmath191 where @xmath192 , @xmath193 for @xmath149 and @xmath194 , @xmath195 for @xmath14 .",
    "the results of this study are in very good agreement with those of takatsuka et al . @xcite .",
    "the stars at lower density denote the @xmath188 values for @xmath190 and @xmath14 which are derived from lattimer et al .",
    "it is concluded that the temperature increases considerably when moving from the outer part of the star to the center in order to maintain a constant value of the entropy per baryon .    by applying the relation @xmath186 presented in fig .",
    "11 , the fractions @xmath196 of isothermal case ( see fig .",
    "3 ) is converted into the isentropic one for @xmath190 .",
    "the population of constituents is plotted in fig .",
    "12 as a function of @xmath3 for @xmath149 and @xmath14 .",
    "the most striking feature of the results is the slight dependence of the fraction @xmath196 from the baryon density @xmath3 ( the same behavior and similar results have been found in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . to sum up , during the adiabatic collapse of a supernova , the population of the constituents ( neutrons , protons , electrons and neutrinos ) are almost the same independent of the density @xmath3 .",
    "the entropy contributions ( for @xmath190 ) from the constituents are presented in fig .",
    "the contributions of the baryon are increasing functions of @xmath3 , the contribution of electrons is increasing function of @xmath3 , while @xmath197 is almost independent of density .",
    "roughly , neutrons , protons , electrons and neutrinos contribute to @xmath74 ( @xmath198 ) by about @xmath199 ( for @xmath149 ) and @xmath200 ( for @xmath14 ) respectively .",
    "our results are quite consistent with those of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "14 , displays the internal energies per baryon of respective components @xmath201 versus @xmath3 for @xmath149 , @xmath14 and @xmath190 .",
    "the main conclusions of the results are similar to those of the isothermal case ( see fig .  7 ) .",
    "the lepton energy ( which mainly originated from electrons contributions ) dominates in the internal energy of the supernova matter even for high values of the density @xmath3 . the nuclear contribution on the internal energy dominates only in high values of @xmath3 ( depending on the lepton fraction @xmath146 ) .    finally , in fig .",
    "15 we compare the eos s between supernova matter and cold neutron star matter .",
    "the case for supernova matter corresponds to @xmath190 and @xmath149 .",
    "it is thus clear that the internal energy @xmath202 of supernova matter ( sm ) is remarkably larger than that of neutron star matter ( ns ) .",
    "as far as the nucleon part @xmath173 is concerned , the @xmath173 in sm is slightly lower than that in ns due to the large energy gain in symmetry energy ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , the lepton contribution on the internal energy @xmath174 is remarkably larger in sn matter compared to ns matter due to the effect of a large lepton fraction , that is , a large kinetic energy of abundant leptons .",
    "high temperature also contributes to the stiffening , but it is less effective than the high lepton fractions ( see also fig .  7 ) .",
    "the present results also correspond well with those presented by takatsuka et al .",
    "@xcite a few years ago",
    "the evaluation of the equation of state of hot nuclear matter is a major challenge for nuclear physics and astrophysics .",
    "eos is the basic ingredient necessary for studying the supernova explosion as well as for determining the properties of hot neutron stars .",
    "the motive for the present work has been to apply a momentum - dependent interaction model for the study of the hot nuclear matter eos under @xmath0-equilibrium .",
    "we have calculated the lepton fractions by applying the constraints for chemical equilibrium and charge neutrality .",
    "the internal energy and also the pressure have been calculated as functions of baryon density and for various values of temperature .",
    "special attention has been dedicated to the study of the contribution of the components of @xmath0-stable nuclear matter on the entropy per particle , a quantity of great interest in the study of structure and collapse of supernova .",
    "we have presented and analyzed the contribution of each component .",
    "finally , we have presented the eos of @xmath0-stable hot nuclear matter , by taking into account and analyzing the contributions to the total pressure of each component .",
    "the above eos can be applied to the evaluation of the gross properties of hot neutron stars i.e. mass and radius .",
