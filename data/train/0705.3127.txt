    "charmless hadronic @xmath1 decays provide important information on the unitarity triangle which may help to reveal the nature of flavour mixing and cp violation .",
    "in order to exploit the rich amount of data that is currently being collected at the @xmath1 factories , a quantitative control of the underlying strong - interaction effects is highly desirable . in the qcd factorization framework  @xcite the hadronic matrix elements of the operators in the effective weak",
    "hamiltonian simplify considerably in the heavy - quark limit .",
    "schematically , @xmath2 where the non - perturbative strong - interaction effects are encoded in a form factor @xmath3 at @xmath4 , decay constants @xmath5 and light - cone distribution amplitudes @xmath6 .",
    "the short - distance kernels @xmath7 and @xmath8 provide the basis for a systematic implementation of radiative corrections ; the former contain the short - distance interactions that do not involve the spectator antiquark from the decaying @xmath9 meson ( _ vertex corrections _ ) and the latter describe the ones with the spectator antiquark ( _ spectator scattering _ ) .    the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections to the kernels @xmath10 , which constitute an @xmath11 correction to naive factorization",
    ", are already known from  @xcite .",
    "recently , the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) corrections to @xmath12 have been computed  @xcite . due to the interaction with the soft spectator antiquark",
    ", the spectator scattering term receives contributions from the hard scale @xmath13 and from an intermediate ( hard - collinear ) scale @xmath14 .",
    "both types of contributions are now available at @xmath15 ( 1-loop ) , indicating that the nnlo corrections are numerically important .",
    "in this work we compute nnlo corrections to @xmath16 for the so - called topological tree amplitudes ( which arise from the insertion of current - current operators ) .",
    "in contrast to the spectator scattering term , the vertex corrections are dominated solely by hard effects and amount to a 2-loop calculation .",
    "in particular , we address the imaginary part of the hard - scattering kernels which is the origin of a strong rescattering phase shift that blurs the information on the weak phases . as an imaginary part",
    "is first generated at @xmath11 , higher order perturbative corrections are expected to significantly influence the pattern of strong phases and hence direct cp asymmetries .",
    "our calculation represents an important step towards a nnlo prediction of direct cp asymmetries in qcd factorization .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : opbasis ] we present our strategy for the calculation of the topological tree amplitudes by introducing two different operator bases .",
    "section  [ sec:2loop ] contains the technical aspects of the 2-loop calculation . in section  [ sec : subs ] we show how to extract the hard - scattering kernels from the hadronic matrix elements .",
    "our analytical results can be found in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "the numerical impact of the nnlo vertex corrections is investigated in section  [ sec : numerics ] and we finally conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "a more detailed presentation of the considered calculation can be found in @xcite .",
    "in view of the calculation of topological tree amplitudes , we restrict our attention to the current - current operators of the effective weak hamiltonian for @xmath17 transitions @xmath18 due to the fact that we work within dimensional regularization ( dr ) , we also have to consider evanescent operators  @xcite .",
    "these non - physical operators vanish in four dimensions but contribute at intermediate steps of the calculation in @xmath19 dimensions .",
    "as the imaginary part has effectively 1-loop complexity with respect to renormalization at @xmath15 , the considered calculation only requires 1-loop evanescent operators . for our purposes the complete operator basis",
    "is thus given by @xmath20 \\ ;     \\left[\\bar d_j \\gamma_\\mu l\\ , u_j\\right],\\no\\\\ \\tilde q_2 & =       \\left[\\bar u_i \\gamma^\\mu l\\ , b_j\\right ] \\ ;     \\left[\\bar d_j \\gamma_\\mu l\\ , u_i\\right],\\no\\\\ \\tilde e_1 & =       \\left[\\bar u_i \\gamma^\\mu\\gamma^\\nu\\gamma^\\rho l\\,b_i\\right ] \\ ;     \\left[\\bar d_j \\gamma_\\mu\\gamma_\\nu\\gamma_\\rho l\\ , u_j\\right ]     -(16 - 4\\eps ) \\,\\tilde q_1,\\no\\\\ \\tilde e_2 & =       \\left[\\bar u_i \\gamma^\\mu\\gamma^\\nu\\gamma^\\rho l\\,b_j\\right ] \\ ;     \\left[\\bar d_j \\gamma_\\mu\\gamma_\\nu\\gamma_\\rho l\\ , u_i\\right ]     -(16 - 4\\eps ) \\,\\tilde q_2 , \\label{eq : tradbasis}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 are colour indices and @xmath22 .",
    "the operator basis in ( [ eq : tradbasis ] ) has been used in all previous calculations within qcd factorization  @xcite .",
    "we refer to this basis as the _ traditional basis _ for convenience and denote the corresponding wilson coefficients and operators with a tilde .",
    "it has been argued by chetyrkin , misiak and mnz ( cmm ) that one should use a different operator basis in order to perform multi - loop calculations  @xcite . although the deeper reason is related to the penguin operators which we do not consider here , we prefer to introduce the _ cmm basis _ in view of future extensions of our work .",
    "this basis allows to consistently use dr with a naive anticommuting @xmath23 to all orders in perturbation theory . in the cmm basis",
    "the current - current operators and corresponding 1-loop evanescent operators read ( indicated by a hat ) @xmath24 \\ ;    \\left[\\bar d_k \\gamma_\\mu l\\ , t^a_{kl } u_l\\right],\\no\\\\ \\hat q_2 & =      \\left[\\bar u_i \\gamma^\\mu l\\ , b_i\\right ] \\ ;    \\left[\\bar d_j \\gamma_\\mu l\\ , u_j\\right],\\no\\\\ \\hat e_1 & =      \\left[\\bar u_i \\gamma^\\mu\\gamma^\\nu\\gamma^\\rho l\\ , t^a_{ij } b_j    \\right ] \\ ;    \\left[\\bar d_k \\gamma_\\mu\\gamma_\\nu\\gamma_\\rho l\\ , t^a_{kl } u_l    \\right ]     - 16 \\,\\hat q_1,\\no\\\\ \\hat e_2 & =      \\left[\\bar u_i \\gamma^\\mu\\gamma^\\nu\\gamma^\\rho l\\ , b_i \\right ] \\ ;    \\left[\\bar d_j \\gamma_\\mu\\gamma_\\nu\\gamma_\\rho l\\ , u_j \\right ]     -16 \\,\\hat q_2 , \\label{eq : cmmbasis}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with colour matrices @xmath25 and colour indices @xmath26 .    comparing the operator bases in ( [ eq : tradbasis ] ) and ( [ eq : cmmbasis ] )",
    "we observe two differences : first , the two bases use different colour decompositions which is a rather trivial point .",
    "more importantly , they contain slightly different definitions of evanescent operators . whereas the definitions in the cmm basis correspond to the simplest prescription to define evanescent operators , subleading terms of @xmath27 appear in the one of the traditional basis .",
    "these terms have been properly adjusted such that fierz symmetry holds to 1-loop order in @xmath28 dimensions .",
    "we follow the notation of  @xcite and express the hadronic matrix elements of the effective weak hamiltonian in terms of topological amplitudes @xmath29 . e.g.  the @xmath30 decay amplitude is written as @xmath31 \\ ; a_{\\pi\\pi } ,   \\label{eq : amplitudes}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 . the amplitude @xmath33 is called the colour - allowed tree amplitude which corresponds to the flavour content @xmath34 $ ] of the decaying @xmath35 meson , @xmath36 $ ] of the recoil meson @xmath37 and @xmath38 $ ] of the emitted meson @xmath39 .",
    "the colour - suppressed tree amplitude @xmath40 then belongs to the flavour contents @xmath34 $ ] , @xmath41 $ ] and @xmath42 $ ] , respectively . for more details concerning the definition of the topological amplitudes we refer to section  2.2 in  @xcite .",
    "according to this definition , the left ( right ) diagram in figure  [ fig : insertions ] contributes to the tree amplitude @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) . on the technical level these two insertions of a four - quark operator",
    "correspond to two different calculations . instead of performing both calculations explicitly , we may alternatively compute the amplitude @xmath44 by inserting fierz reordered operators into the left diagram of figure  [ fig : insertions ] . to do so , it is essential to work with an operator basis that respects fierz symmetry in @xmath28 dimensions .",
    "as we have argued above , fierz symmetry indeed holds to 1-loop order in the traditional basis from ( [ eq : tradbasis ] ) which allows us to _ derive _ @xmath44 directly from @xmath43 .",
    "we conclude that the cmm basis is the appropriate choice for a 2-loop calculation whereas the traditional basis provides a short - cut for the derivation of the colour - suppressed amplitude .",
    "we therefore pursue the following strategy for the calculation of the imaginary part of the nnlo vertex corrections : we perform the explicit 2-loop calculation in the cmm basis using the first type of operator insertion in the left diagram from figure  [ fig : insertions ] . from this",
    "we obtain @xmath45 .",
    "we then transform this expression into the traditional basis which yields @xmath46 and finally apply fierz symmetry arguments to derive @xmath47 from @xmath46 by simply exchanging @xmath48 .",
    "the core of the considered calculation consists in the computation of the matrix elements @xmath49 to @xmath15 which represents a 2-loop calculation . as will be described in section  [ sec : factnnlo ] , only ( naively ) non - factorizable diagrams with at least one gluon connecting the two currents in the left diagram of figure  [ fig : insertions ] have to be considered here .",
    "the full nnlo calculation thus involves the 2-loop diagrams depicted in figure  [ fig : diagrams ] , but only about half of the diagrams give rise to an imaginary part .",
    "it is an easy task to identify this subset of diagrams since the generation of an imaginary part is always related to final state interactions .    in our calculation",
    "we treat the partons on - shell and write @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 satisfying @xmath4 and @xmath53 ( with @xmath54 ) .",
    "we use dr for the regularization of ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) divergences and an anticommuting @xmath23 according to the ndr scheme .",
    "we stress that we do not perform any projection onto the bound states in the partonic calculation .",
    "we instead treat the two currents in the four - quark operators independently and make use of the equations of motion in order to simplify the dirac structures of the diagrams . in order to calculate the large number of 2-loop integrals we proceed as follows : using a general tensor decomposition of the loop integrals",
    ", we essentially deal with the calculation of scalar integrals . with the help of an automatized reduction algorithm , we are able to express several thousands of scalar integrals in terms of a small set of so - called master integrals ( mis ) .",
    "the most difficult part finally consists in the calculation of these mis .    in the remainder of this section we present some techniques that we have found useful for the considered calculation .",
    "we sketch the basic ideas of the aforementioned reduction algorithm and discuss several techniques for the calculation of the mis .",
    "we refer to the references quoted in the following subsections for more detailed descriptions ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "any scalar 2-loop integral in our calculation can be expressed as @xmath55 where the @xmath56 are scalar products of a loop momentum with an external momentum or of two loop momenta .",
    "the @xmath57 denote the denominators of propagators and the exponents fulfil @xmath58 .",
    "the scalar integrals themselves depend on the convolution variable @xmath59 in the factorization formula ( [ eq : qcdf ] ) .",
    "very few integrals , arising from diagrams with a charm quark in a closed fermion loop , depend in addition on the ratio @xmath60 .",
    "we have suppressed this dependence in ( [ eq : int ] ) for simplicity .",
    "notice that an integral has different representations in terms of @xmath61 because of the freedom to shift loop momenta in dr .",
    "it is the underlying topology , i.e. the interconnection of propagators and external momenta , which uniquely defines the integral . in the following we loosely use the word topology in order to classify the integrals .",
    "an integral with @xmath62 different propagators @xmath57 with @xmath63 is called a @xmath62-topology .",
    "the integrals in the considered calculation have topology @xmath64 .",
    "the reduction algorithm makes use of various identities which relate integrals with different exponents @xmath65 .",
    "the most important class of identities are the integration - by - parts identities  @xcite which follow from the fact that surface terms vanish in dr @xmath66 in order to obtain scalar identities we may contract ( [ eq : ibp ] ) with any loop or external momentum under the integral before performing the derivative . in our case of two loop and two external momenta",
    "we generate in this way eight identities from each integral .    a second class of identities , called lorentz - invariance identities  @xcite , exploits the fact that the integrals in ( [ eq : int ] ) transform as scalars under a lorentz - transformation of the external momenta . in this way",
    "we may generate up to six identities from each integral depending on the number of external momenta . in our example with only two linearly independent external momenta @xmath67 and @xmath68",
    "there is only one such identity given by @xmath69 \\ ;          \\frac{\\cals_1^{m_1 } \\ldots \\cals_s^{m_s } }           { \\calp_1^{n_1}\\ldots \\calp_p^{n_p } }   \\;=\\ ; 0 .",
    "\\label{eq : li}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in total we obtain nine identities from a given integral , each of the identities containing the integral itself , simpler integrals with smaller @xmath65 and more complicated integrals with larger @xmath65 .",
    "it is important that the number of identities grows faster than the number of unknown integrals for increasing @xmath65 .",
    "hence , for large enough @xmath65 the system of equations becomes ( apparently ) overconstrained and can be used to express more complicated integrals in terms of simpler ones .",
    "not all of the identities being linearly independent , some integrals turn out to be irreducible to which we refer as mis .    in the considered calculation we typically deal with systems of equations made of several thousands equations .",
    "the solution being straight - forward , the runtime of the reduction algorithm depends strongly on the order in which the equations are solved . as a guideline for an efficient implementation",
    "we have followed the algorithm from  @xcite .",
    "the reduction algorithm enables us to express the diagrams of figure  [ fig : diagrams ] as linear combinations of mis which are multiplied by some dirac structures .",
    "as the coefficients in these linear combinations are real , we may extract the imaginary part of a diagram at the level of the mis which is a much simpler task than for the full diagrams .",
    "as depicted in figure  [ fig : mis ] , we find 14 mis that contribute to the calculation of the imaginary part of the nnlo vertex corrections .",
    "some mis in figure  [ fig : mis ] can be solved easily e.g.  with the help of feynman parameters . for the more complicated mis",
    "the method of differential equations  @xcite in combination with the formalism of harmonic polylogarithms ( hpls )  @xcite turned out to be very useful . in this section",
    "we give brief reviews of these techniques and conclude with a comment on the calculation of the boundary conditions to the differential equations .",
    "the analytical results for the mis from figure  [ fig : mis ] can be found in appendix  a.1 of  @xcite . as an independent check of our results we evaluated the mis numerically using the method of sector decomposition  @xcite .",
    "the mis are functions of the physical scales of the process which are given by scalar products of the external momenta and masses of the particles . in our calculation",
    "the mis depend on the dimensionless variable @xmath59 as in ( [ eq : int ] ) .",
    "for a given mi we perform the derivative with respect to @xmath59 and interchange the order of integration and derivation @xmath70 the right - hand side being of the same type as equations ( [ eq : ibp ] ) and ( [ eq : li ] ) , this procedure again leads to a sum of various integrals with different exponents @xmath65 . with the help of the reduction algorithm",
    ", these integrals can be expressed in terms of mis which yields a differential equation of the form @xmath71 where we indicated that the coefficients @xmath72 and @xmath73 may depend on the dimension @xmath28 .",
    "the inhomogeneity of the differential equation typically contains mis of subtopologies which are supposed to be known in a bottom - up approach . in case of the mis from the third line of figure  [ fig : mis ] ,",
    "one mi in the inhomogeneous part is of the same topology as the mi on the left hand side of ( [ eq : diffeq ] ) and thus unknown .",
    "writing down the differential equation for this mi , we find that we are left with a coupled system of linear , first order differential equations .",
    "we are looking for a solution of the differential equation in terms of an expansion @xmath74 expanding ( [ eq : diffeq ] ) then gives much simpler differential equations for the coefficients @xmath75 which can be solved order by order in @xmath76 .",
    "in addition , in the case where we were left with a coupled system of differential equations , the system turns out to decouple in the expansion .",
    "the solution of the homogeneous equations is in general straight - forward .",
    "the inhomogeneous equations can then be addressed with the method of the variation of the constant .",
    "this in turn leads to indefinite integrals over the inhomogeneities which typically contain products of rational functions with logarithms or related functions as dilogarithms . with the help of the formalism of hpls these integrations",
    "simplify substantially .",
    "the formalism of hpls  @xcite allows to rewrite the integrations mentioned at the end of the last section in terms of familiar transcendental functions which are defined by repeated integration over a set of basic functions .",
    "we briefly summarize their basic features here , focussing on the properties that are relevant for our calculation .",
    "the hpls , denoted by @xmath77 , are described by a @xmath78-dimensional vector @xmath79 of parameters and by its argument @xmath80 .",
    "we restrict our attention to the parameters @xmath81 and @xmath82 in the following .",
    "the basic definitions of the hpls are for weight @xmath83 @xmath84 and for weight @xmath85 @xmath86 where the basic functions @xmath87 are given by @xmath88 in the case of @xmath89 , the definition in ( [ eq : hpl ] ) does not apply and the hpls read @xmath90 the hpls form a closed and linearly independent set under integrations over the basic functions @xmath87 and fulfil an algebra such that a product of two hpls of weight @xmath91 and @xmath92 gives a linear combination of hpls of weight @xmath93 .",
    "as described above , the solution of the differential equations leads to integrals over products of some rational functions with some transcendental functions as logarithms or dilogarithms .",
    "more precisely , we find e.g.  integrals of the type @xmath94 it turns out that all these integrals can be expressed as linear combinations of hpls of weight @xmath95 .",
    "this is obvious for the first integral as it simply corresponds to the definition of a hpl , cf .",
    "( [ eq : hpl ] ) with @xmath96 . for the other integrals in ( [ eq : hplints ] )",
    ", an integration - by - parts leads either to a recurrence relation or again to integrals of the type ( [ eq : hpl ] ) .",
    "not all integrals in our calculation fall into the simple pattern ( [ eq : hplints ] ) , but a large part of this calculation can be performed along these lines .    in the considered calculation we encounter hpls of weight @xmath97 .",
    "our results can be expressed in terms of the following minimal set of hpls @xmath98 the situation is more complicated for the last two mis in the third line of figure  [ fig : mis ] where the internal charm quark introduces a new scale . however",
    ", a closer look reveals that these mis depend on two physical scales only , namely @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the mis can then be solved within the formalism of hpls in terms of the ratio @xmath101 if we allow for more complicated arguments of the hpls as e.g.  @xmath102 .",
    "a unique solution of a differential equation requires the knowledge of its boundary conditions . in the considered calculation",
    "the boundary conditions typically represent single - scale integrals corresponding to @xmath103 or @xmath82 .",
    "it is of crucial importance that the integral has a smooth limit at the chosen point such that setting @xmath103 or @xmath104 does not modify the divergence structure introduced in ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) .    in some cases the methods described so far",
    "can also be applied for the calculation of the boundary conditions since setting @xmath103 or @xmath82 leads to simpler topologies which may turn out to be reducible . if so , the reduction algorithm can be used to express the integral in terms of known mis .",
    "if not , a different strategy is mandatory . in this case we tried to calculate the integral with the help of feynman parameters and managed in some cases to express the integral in terms of hypergeometric functions which we could expand in @xmath76 with the help of the mathematica package hypexp  @xcite .",
    "finally , the most difficult single - scale integrals could be calculated with mellin - barnes techniques  @xcite .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath105 which we obtained from computing the 2-loop diagrams in figure  [ fig : diagrams ] are ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) divergent . in this section we show how to extract the finite hard - scattering kernels @xmath106 from these matrix elements .",

    "this value is somewhat larger than the one used in previous qcd factorization analyses  @xcite , but it is supported by a qcd sum rule and a lcsr calculation  @xcite .",
    "the value for the second gegenbauer moment of the pion can be inferred from a lcsr analysis  @xcite and lattice results  @xcite .    in order to estimate the size of higher - order perturbative corrections we vary the hard scale in the range @xmath276 and the hard - collinear scale independently between @xmath277 . throughout",
    "we use 2-loop running of @xmath278 with @xmath221 ( @xmath279 ) for quantities that are evaluated at the hard scale @xmath280 ( hard - collinear scale @xmath281 ) .",
    "the quark masses are interpreted as pole masses except for those entering @xmath282 .    with these input parameters the complete nnlo result for the imaginary part of the topological tree amplitudes",
    "is found to be @xmath283 in these expressions we disentangled the contributions from the nlo ( 1-loop ) vertex corrections @xmath284 , nnlo ( 2-loop ) vertex corrections @xmath285 and nnlo ( 1-loop ) spectator scattering @xmath286 . in both cases the nnlo corrections",
    "are found to be important , although small in absolute terms .",
    "for the imaginary part of @xmath43 the nnlo corrections exceed the formally leading nlo result which can be explained by the fact that the latter is multiplied by the small wilson coefficient @xmath231 , cf .  the discussion after ( [ eq : v12num ] ) .",
    "we further observe that the individual nnlo corrections come with opposite signs which leads to a partial cancellation in their sum .",
    "the phenomenologically most important consequence of our calculation may be the enhancement of the imaginary part of the colour - suppressed tree amplitude @xmath44 .    in our error estimate in ( [ eq",
    ": nnloresult ] ) we distinguished between uncertainties which originate from the variation of the hard and the hard - collinear scale ( scale ) , from the variation of the input parameters in table  [ tab : numeric ] ( param ) and from the bbns model which we used to estimate the size of power - corrections ( power ) .",
    "by now we expect the power corrections to be the main limiting factor for an accurate determination of the amplitudes .",
    "however , although the inclusion of nnlo corrections has reduced the dependence on the renormalization scales , it still remains sizeable ( in particular for @xmath280 ) . for our final error estimate in the third line of each amplitude , we added all uncertainties in quadrature .    finally we remark that our numerical values for the nnlo spectator terms are much smaller than the ones quoted in  @xcite .",
    "this is partly related to the fact that we use different hadronic input parameters , in particular a much larger value for @xmath265 .",
    "in addition to this , the authors of  @xcite essentially evaluate the hard functions @xmath237 at the hard - collinear scale in order to partly implement the ( unknown ) nll resummation of parametrically large logarithms .",
    "the nll approximation is indeed required for the real part of the amplitudes , but as long as we concentrate on the imaginary part it is consistent to work in the ll approximation as discussed in section  [ sec : specscat ] . as the spectator term is the main source for the uncertainties from the hadronic input parameters , we also obtain smaller error bars than  @xcite .",
    "we computed the imaginary part of the 2-loop vertex corrections to the topological tree amplitudes in charmless hadronic @xmath1 decays . together with the 1-loop spectator scattering contributions considered in  @xcite ,",
    "the imaginary part of the tree amplitudes is now completely determined at nnlo in qcd factorization .    among the technical issues we showed that soft and collinear infrared divergences cancel in the hard - scattering kernels and that the resulting convolutions are finite , which demonstrates factorization at the 2-loop order . in our numerical analysis we found that the nnlo corrections are significant , in particular they enhance the strong phase of the colour - suppressed tree amplitude @xmath44 .",
    "further improvements of the calculation still require a better understanding of power corrections to the factorization formula .",
    "our calculation represents an important step towards a nnlo prediction of direct cp asymmetries in qcd factorization .",
    "as the topological penguin amplitudes , which also affect the direct cp asymmetries , have not yet been computed completely at nnlo ( the contribution from spectator scattering can be found in  @xcite ) , we refrained from discussing them already in this work .",
    "moreover , the strategy outlined in this work may also be applied for the calculation of the real part of the topological tree amplitudes , which is , however , technically more involved  @xcite .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank gerhard buchalla for his continuous help and guidance and for helpful comments on the manuscript .",
    "i am also grateful to volker pilipp and sebastian jger for interesting discussions .",
