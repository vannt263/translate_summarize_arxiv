    "we reconsider the two - dimensional @xmath0 model with random phase shifts and a symmetry - breaking field , which is described by the reduced hamiltonian @xmath1 @xmath0 spins @xmath2 are placed on the sites @xmath3 of a square lattice .",
    "the coupling of nearest neighbors with a spin stiffness @xmath4 favors a relative angle prescribed by the quenched random phase shifts @xmath5 , which we assume to be gaussian distributed with zero mean and variance @xmath6 .",
    "the global rotation symmetry of spins is broken by the field @xmath7 that selects @xmath8 equivalent favorable directions for the spins .",
    "the model will be considered with uniform fields ( @xmath9 ) and with random local orientations @xmath10 of the field .",
    "this model describes a variety of physical systems , ranging from disordered magnets@xcite to josephson - junction arrays@xcite and planar josephson - junctions.@xcite it is also closely related to surfaces of crystals with bulk disorder@xcite and even to periodic elastic media such as vortex lattices in the presence of a pinning potential,@xcite two - dimensional crystals with quenched impurities@xcite or adsorbates on disordered substrates.@xcite    the study of the above and related models started already decades ago .",
    "we briefly recall some marked steps in its history to provide the background for the present work .",
    "the @xmath0 model in the absence of disorder and magnetic fields exhibits the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition from a phase with quasi - long - range order ( qlro , i.e. , algebraic decay of the spin - spin correlation ) to short - range order ( sro , i.e. , exponential decay of the spin - spin correlation ) at @xmath11,@xcite where the effective spin stiffness @xmath12 is renormalized by thermal fluctuations .",
    "the transition was identified with an unbinding of vortex pairs .",
    "uniform _ fields have been included by jos , kadanoff , kirkpatrick , and nelson.@xcite for @xmath13 they found that the phase with qlro is stable against such fields over a temperature range @xmath14 and that weak fields become relevant at low temperatures @xmath15 where they stabilize long - range order ( lro , i.e. finite magnetization ) .",
    "for @xmath16 the transition resulting from the competition between the ordering tendency of the magnetic field and the disordering tendency of the thermal fluctuations could not be captured by a kt - like approach .",
    "houghton , kenway , and ying@xcite found the phase with qlro to be unstable to magnetic fields with _ random _ orientation only for @xmath17 .",
    "accordingly , a phase with qlro can be stable within a finite temperature range @xmath18 provided @xmath19 .",
    "their study was extended by cardy and ostlund@xcite ( co ) to address the nature of the phase transitions and of the low - temperature phase .",
    "their analysis implied that randomness of the direction of the magnetic field effectively generates a new type of disorder on large scales ( in the sense of a renormalization group ) , namely random phase shifts @xmath5.@xcite    rubinstein , shraiman , and nelson@xcite ( rsn ) examined the @xmath0 model with random phase shifts in the absence of fields .",
    "they found qlro to be stable against disorder below a certain critical strength and a phase diagram with reentrant shape .",
    "paczuski and kardar@xcite ( pk ) added uniform fields and obtained a phase diagram composed of various phases with lro , qlro , and sro .",
    "the transitions between these phases showed multiple reentrance .",
    "recent advance in the understanding of the bond - disordered model without fields has led to a revised nonreentrant phase diagram , where the phase with qlro turned out to be more stable than found by rsn.@xcite the earlier underestimation of the order in the system was caused by a subtle _ breakdown of the fugacity expansion _ in the coulomb gas representation of the model at low temperatures.@xcite this breakdown was overcome in these recent approaches by nonperturbative techniques .",
    "the features of the revised phase diagram have been confirmed by numerical simulations.@xcite    the breakdown of the fugacity expansion is likely to affect _ all _ problems involving random phase shifts . in particular",
    "one has to ask how the structure of the phase diagram , the nature of the phases and the nature of the phase transitions are modified .",
    "it is also important to examine whether a similar breakdown occurs in a perturbative treatment of the fields .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to reexamine model ( [ h ] ) in view of these questions .",
    "the method of our choice is a mapping of model ( [ h ] ) on two coupled coulomb gases , `` vortices '' and `` charges '' ( sec .",
    "thereby we take a pre - averaging over disorder using the replica trick .",
    "we establish renormalization group flow equations for the model parameters to capture the large scale properties of the system ( sec .",
    "iii ) . from the evaluation of these flow equations ( sec .",
    "iv ) we obtain results that are significantly different from those obtained by co and pk for the special cases of ferromagnetic bonds with random fields and bond disorder with uniform fields .",
    "our phase diagrams are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.schem ] for these two previously examined special cases .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of our results and of consequences for physical realizations of the @xmath0 model ( sec .",
    "appendices with some calculational details and a dictionary for a translation of notations from previous works to the present work are included .",
    "in this section we specify the stochastic properties of the random phase shifts considered subsequently .",
    "in addition , we transfer randomness in the orientation of the symmetry - breaking fields to the random phase shifts such that we need to deal only with ( correlated ) bond disorder . the latter model is then mapped onto two coupled coulomb gases .",
    "eventually we arrive at a replica representation of the model that serves as basis for our further analysis .      in order to be able to treat the model irrespectively of a randomness in the local field orientation ,",
    "we decompose the field @xmath20 in fourier space into its longitudinal and transverse component ,    [ def.a ] @xmath21    both components ( polarizations @xmath22 ) are supposed to be gaussian distributed with zero average and to have variances ( over - lining denotes averaging over quenched disorder ) @xmath23 where we explicitly allow for @xmath24 .",
    "then the random phase shifts have a variance @xmath25 and are in general correlated in space .",
    "only in the special case @xmath26 the phase shifts are uncorrelated on different bonds of the lattice .",

    "we will also examine correlations of the edwards - anderson order parameter    [ ea.corr ] @xmath31    between different replicas",
    "@xmath32 of the system . in the spin - wave approximation",
    "the exponent @xmath33 is completely independent of disorder.@xcite      a convenient way of dealing with the randomness in the local field orientation @xmath10 is to eliminate the angles @xmath10 in favor of modified phase shifts @xmath34 by a substitution @xmath35 .",
    "this transformation leaves the thermodynamic partition sum invariant , i.e. , @xmath36 therefore , the existence and location of phase transitions in the phase diagram are not affected by this manipulation .",
    "in contrast , spin correlation functions are _ not _ invariant and can display qualitatively different large - scale behavior before and after the transformation .    in order to restrict our analysis of random phase shifts to those with correlations ( [ corr.a ] ) even after the transformation , we limit the possible distributions of the angles @xmath10 to those having a gaussian distribution with correlations @xmath37 only such random orientations are transformed by the above mapping into longitudinal phase shifts with a variance @xmath38 equation ( [ corr.alpha ] ) implies correlations @xmath39 for @xmath40 in real space",
    ". however , in the limit @xmath41 the relative fluctuations even of neighboring angles are that large that they can be considered practically as uncorrelated since they enter the hamiltonian only modulo @xmath42 . in this sense",
    "the examination of the model ( [ h ] ) with random phase shifts and uniform field effectively includes the model with random symmetry - breaking fields in the limit @xmath43 .",
    "we apply standard techniques@xcite to map model ( [ h ] ) onto a coulomb gas . for this purpose",
    "we first use the villain approximation@xcite to replace both cosines in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) by a slightly different periodic potential and obtain an effective hamiltonian @xmath44 the partition sum of this effective model contains not only the integration over the angles @xmath45 but also a summation over the integer - valued vector field @xmath46 and the integer - valued scalar field @xmath47 .",
    "the parameters of this effective model are related to the original parameters by @xmath48 and @xmath49 through the function @xcite @xmath50 since we are mainly interested in the stability of the phase with qlro ( i.e. , @xmath51 ) to symmetry - breaking fields ( i.e. , @xmath52 ) , we effectively operate in the limiting cases @xmath53 and @xmath54 .    for small @xmath55",
    "the sum over @xmath47 converges very slowly .",
    "therefore it is of advantage to go over from the field @xmath47 to a conjugate integer - valued field @xmath56 by means of the poisson summation formula ( some calculational details are given in appendix [ app.cg ] ) .",
    "after integrating out the angles @xmath45 in the partition sum we end up with a new effective hamiltonian for two coupled coulomb gases .",
    "the first coulomb gas is the gas of _ vortices _ with a vorticity @xmath57 .",
    "these vortices are located on the dual lattice , i.e. , on plaquette centers @xmath58.@xcite the _ `` charges '' _ @xmath59 constitute the second coulomb gas .",
    "these coulomb gases are coupled to _",
    "`` quenched vortices '' _ @xmath60 and _ `` quenched charges '' _ @xmath61 , which are generated by the transverse and longitudinal components of the bond disorder respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian of the effective model reads    [ h.rs ] @xmath62    it has been split into the interaction among vortices @xmath63 , the interaction among charges @xmath64 , the interaction between vortices and charges @xmath65 , and an excess term @xmath66 .",
    "particles of the same type interact logarithmically and the coupling between the two gases is given by the angle @xmath67 enclosed by their relative distance and an arbitrary reference direction in the @xmath68 plane ( see appendix [ app.cg ] for some intermediate steps ) . due to the introduction of the charges by means of the poisson summation formula there are two imaginary - valued contributions to the hamiltonian : the coupling of thermal charges @xmath56 to quenched charges @xmath69 and the coupling of vortices @xmath70 to charges @xmath56 . however , the partition sum is real - valued since the imaginary parts cancel in pairs @xmath71",
    "+ \\exp[-{\\cal   h } ( \\{n\\ } , \\{-n\\})]$ ] .",
    "both gases are dilute for @xmath72 and @xmath73 , where the core energies @xmath74 are large ( @xmath75 is a constant of order unity@xcite emerging from the lattice green function ) .",
    "although these core energies are determined by @xmath76 and @xmath55 we will consider them formally as independent parameters in the subsequent treatment .",
    "the partition function of this effective model ( [ h.rs ] ) reads @xmath77 the primed summation is constrained by neutrality conditions @xmath78 since the real part of the energy of nonneutral configurations diverges logarithmically with the system size .",
    "the direct analysis of the partition sum ( [ z.rs ] ) in the spirit of the kt renormalization group ( rg ) is prevented by the broken translation invariance in the presence of the quenched vortices and charges .",
    "since we are aiming at the calculation of disorder - averaged quantities , such as the correlation function ( [ def.gamma ] ) , we may perform the disorder average on the replicated partition sum already at this stage.@xcite    for an integer number of replicas @xmath56 the hamiltonian of the replicated system is most conveniently expressed in a vector notation , where @xmath79 for @xmath80 is a replica charge at site @xmath81 and @xmath82 is a replica vortex at site @xmath58 :    [ h.rep ] @xmath83    all parameters are incorporated in the replica - symmetric coupling matrices    [ e.k ] @xmath84    hamiltonian ( [ h.rep ] ) is a generalization of that given in sec .",
    "ii of co. in the limit @xmath43 we retrieve their model , i.e. , eq .",
    "( [ h.rep.hc ] ) becomes equivalent to their eq .",
    "( 2.15 ) . furthermore , in this limit the contribution of the charge core energy proportional to @xmath85 enforces an additional neutrality @xmath86 across the replicas , i.e. , the weight of nonneutral configurations vanishes in the partition sum .",
    "then the vector @xmath87 can be decomposed into pairs of type @xmath88 at every site .",
    "such pairs correspond to the vector charges of co. however , for finite @xmath85 the summation over charges is _ not _ restricted by this additional neutrality condition .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ h.rep ] ) contains an _ explicit _ coupling between vortices and charges .",
    "the effective model under consideration is self - dual,@xcite i.e. , it is invariant under a mutual exchange of vortices and charges with a simultaneous substitution of parameters . for the unreplicated model ( [ h.rs ] )",
    "these substitutions are @xmath89 this duality implies a relation @xmath90 for the partition sum,@xcite which simplifies our subsequent calculations because it enables us to relate renormalization effects arising from vortex fluctuations to renormalization effects arising from charge fluctuations or vice versa . in this way pk obtained recursion relations for the bond - disordered model _ with _ field from those of rsn _ without _ field .",
    "we are going to use the same strategy starting from the corrected flow equations.@xcite    we will proceed within the replica formulation ( [ h.rep ] ) , where the self - duality of the model is reflected by the substitutions @xmath91 the excess contribution ( [ h.x ] ) to the hamiltonian of the unreplicated system effectively modifies the action of the longitudinal disorder distribution .",
    "the duality @xmath92 implies @xmath93 .",
    "the latter relation is consistent with eq .",
    "( [ dual ] ) if one keeps in mind the presence of the excess term in eq .",
    "( [ dual.z ] ) .",
    "this term gives rise to the denominator @xmath94 that becomes unity in the limit @xmath95 that eventually will be taken .",
    "after the coulomb gas representation of our model has been established in the previous section we now turn to a scaling analysis for the relevance of vortices and charges .",
    "we basically follow kosterlitz rg approach @xcite to the @xmath0 model and its recent generalization@xcite to the @xmath0 model with random phase shifts . to account for magnetic fields we have to include charges and their coupling to the vortices .    following ref .",
    "we introduce the notion of `` _ types _ '' of replica vortices and charges .",
    "we consider charges at site @xmath96 and site @xmath97 as being of the same or of different type if @xmath98 or @xmath99 in analogy to the vortex types . from the core energy contribution to the hamiltonian ( [ h.rep ] ) we identify fugacities    [ fuga ] @xmath100    for each type of particles . because of the replica symmetry of the matrices @xmath101 and @xmath102 different particle types have the same fugacity if they belong to the same `` _ class _",
    ", '' that is , if they are of the same type after a permutation of replicas and/or an inversion of the replica vector ( such as @xmath103 ) .      in the limit of vanishing field",
    "all charge fugacities ( [ fuga]b ) go to zero .",
    "the relevance of a weak field can be examined by looking at the scaling behavior of the charge fugacities .",
    "as soon as the fugacity of some charge type increases under rescaling , the field constitutes a relevant perturbation .",
    "analogously , the relevance of vortices signals the importance of topologically nontrivial spin configurations .",
    "however , while a relevance of vortices indicates a tendency to reduced spin correlations on large scales , a relevance of charges expresses a tendency to enhanced spin correlations .",
    "a rescaling of lengths @xmath104 and @xmath105 with an infinitesimal increase on a logarithmic length scale @xmath106 has the following effect on hamiltonian ( [ h.rep ] ) : the angles @xmath107 are invariant but the logarithms generate additive constants , @xmath108 .",
    "using the neutrality conditions ( [ neutr ] ) the twofold spatial summations over these constants can be reduced to single summations .",
    "then the rescaling effectively amounts to an additive flow of the core matrices @xmath109 , or equivalently to a multiplicative flow of the fugacities    @xmath110    for a finite number @xmath56 of replicas we can now determine the stability of qlro to vortices and charges at given temperature @xmath111 and disorder strengths @xmath112 by looking for the most relevant class of particles .",
    "we focus here on the charge sector , since the vortex sector has been covered in ref . .",
    "the _ most relevant _ charge class is the one that minimizes @xmath113.\\ ] ] the minimum is provided by charges of class @xmath114 for @xmath115 and by charges of class @xmath116 for @xmath117 .",
    "the class `` @xmath114 '' is composed of all replica charges @xmath87 that contain an elementary charge in a single replica [ e.g. , @xmath118 and the class `` @xmath116 '' is composed of all replica charges @xmath119 that contain an elementary charge in one replica and an opposite elementary charge in a second replica [ i.e. , the co vector charges , such as @xmath120 .",
    "let us consider for illustration vector charges that are composed only of @xmath121 elementary charges , thereof @xmath122 are positive and @xmath123 are negative .",
    "the fugacity of such charges scales like @xmath124   \\frac{p^2}{4 \\pi}\\right]\\right\\ } .\\ ] ] figure [ fig.relev ] displays the stability boundary in the ( @xmath125 ) plane for various classes of charges , which are irrelevant on the high - temperature side of the corresponding ( full ) lines .",
    "charge class @xmath114 is most relevant on the high - temperature side ( @xmath126 ) and charge class @xmath127 is most relevant on the low temperature side ( @xmath128 ) of the dashed line .",
    "there is an important difference in the scaling analysis for charges and for vortices .",
    "the region of the phase diagram , where _ all _ @xmath56-component charges are irrelevant , is _ independent _ of the number @xmath56 of replicas .",
    "in addition , the boundary of this region is invariantly given for _ all _ integer @xmath56 by the charge classes @xmath114 or @xmath116 ( strictly speaking , the class @xmath116 exists only for @xmath129 ) .",
    "this independence on @xmath56 indicates that the replica limit @xmath130 can be taken in a very simple way .",
    "in contrast , the region where all vortices are irrelevant depends explicitly on @xmath56 and so does the class of the most relevant vortices at lower temperatures ( see fig . 2 of ref . ) .",
    "therefore the replica limit will be easier to take for charges than for vortices .",
    "the save proceeding for both cases is to consider the collective renormalization of the physical parameters by all classes of vortices and charges , which will be carried out subsequently .",
    "we anticipate here that through this proceeding we obtain first closed expressions for the collective effects of charges , for which the perturbative expansion in small charge fugacities can be justified _",
    "a posteriori_. the various terms in this expansion can again be identified with vector charge classes .",
    "the leading terms correspond to the most relevant classes identified above and the stability region ( shaded area ) of fig .",
    "[ fig.relev ] remains unchanged .",
    "the renormalization of parameters on large scales due to fluctuations on small scales will now be calculated by integrating out pairs of particles from the partition sum following the approach of kosterlitz.@xcite since our model possesses the vortex - charge duality , it is sufficient to perform the actual calculations only in one particle sector .",
    "the renormalization effects of the other sector are then obtained by a duality transformation .",
    "we adopt the results for the vortex sector directly from ref . . however , we extend these previous calculations at two points .",
    "first , we calculate the flow equations for the fugacities to higher order in the fugacities .",
    "this extension is necessary to consider the parameter renormalizations not only within the phase with qlro , but also in the phase where magnetic fields are relevant .",
    "this requires flow equations of higher order in the charge fugacities , which we can obtain through the duality mapping only from the terms of higher order in the vortex fugacities .",
    "second , when the vortex dipoles are integrated out in the presence of charges , they renormalize the interactions among the charges ( and vice versa ) .",
    "this feature was naturally absent in ref . , where fields were not included .    for technical convenience we allow replica vortices to take positions in the continuous space and not only on the lattice .",
    "the lattice provides only a cutoff ( taken to be unity ) for the minimal distance between vortices .",
    "our present goal is to integrate out all configurations in the partition sum , where the smallest distance between two replica vortices ( of any type ) lies in the range @xmath131 .",
    "we follow young s treatment of a vector coulomb gas,@xcite which can be applied directly to our vectors @xmath132 . during this procedure",
    "two cases have to be distinguished : ( i ) the two close vortices are of opposite type , i.e. , @xmath133 ( in the continuous space subscripts to @xmath132 denote the particle label instead of the position ) and ( ii ) these two vortices are not of opposite type , i.e. , @xmath134 .    in case ( i ) , where the pair of close vortices is composed of a vortex and its antivortex , they essentially annihilate .",
    "the leading interaction with the other particles , which are approximately considered to be far away , is through the dipole moment of the pair . because of the polarizability of this dipole moment",
    "the pair screens the interaction between the other particles.@xcite the screening of the interaction among vortices can be captured by a flow of the coupling @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the replica vortex density correlation at the cutoff distance [ see eq .",
    "( 13 ) of ref . ] . due to the angular coupling between vortices and charges",
    "there is an additional screening of the interaction among charges ( see appendix [ app.screen ] ) : @xmath137 besides the screening of these coupling matrices , the annihilation of such dipoles changes the free energy per unit area and per replica by @xmath138    in case ( ii ) the two close vortices appear ( in the eyes of the other particles , which are assumed to be far away ) essentially as a single vortex of type @xmath139 , i.e. the dominant interaction with the other particles is not given by the dipole moment of the pair but by the total vorticity .",
    "therefore we can `` replace '' the two vortices by the single one , i.e. , we transfer the statistical weight of the entire particle configuration to a different particle configuration , where the two close vortices 1 and 2 are replaced by a vortex of type 3 and all other particles are unchanged . by analogy with young s",
    "analysis@xcite [ leading to his eq .",
    "( 75 ) ] we obtain @xmath140 the neutrality conditions ( [ neutr ] ) are preserved under such types of recombination .      in order to establish the rg flow equations , we combine the contributions from scaling and screening . using the duality relations ( [ dual.rep ] ) we infer the contributions by charge fluctuations immediately from those by vortex fluctuations that have been given above .",
    "thus , after collecting all terms , we find the complete flow equations for the replicated system    [ flow.y ] @xmath141    and    [ flow.param ] @xmath142    since we establish the flow equations for an infinitesimal change of the cutoff , we assume that we can simply add vortex and charge contributions , i.e. , that there are no terms mixing vortex and charge fugacities .",
    "such a mixing could arise in principle if one implies a minimal cutoff distance not only among vortices and among charges , but also between vortices and charges .",
    "we are inclined to believe that a hard - core interaction between vortices and charges is not necessary , because we do not expect divergences related to short distances of that type : due to the imaginary - valued nature of angular coupling ( [ h.vc ] ) in the hamiltonian it seems plausible that configurations with close vortex - charge pairs give no essential contribution to the partition sum .    since not only the original couplings @xmath143 but also the particle density correlations @xmath144 are replica - symmetric , this symmetry holds also for the screened couplings .",
    "even more , the renormalized matrices @xmath145 and @xmath146 can be reexpressed in terms of renormalized parameters @xmath76 and @xmath112 preserving relations ( [ e.k]a , b ) : equations ( [ flow.param]a,b ) are equivalent to    [ flow.par ] @xmath147.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thereby the particle correlation matrices were decomposed into the `` connected '' and `` disconnected '' contributions according to @xmath148 for both vortices and charges .      so far , the derivation of the rg flow equations for the replicated system have been conceptually straightforward . the less trivial part is to take the replica limit , i.e. , to perform an analytic continuation for @xmath130 .",
    "the first step in this direction was the reduction of the @xmath143 matrix flow equation to the parameter flow equations ( [ flow.par ] ) .",
    "we focus on these equations , since the physical large - scale properties of our system show up in the flow of these parameters . in order to send @xmath130 in these flow equations",
    ", we have to overcome only one hurdle : to make @xmath56 an explicit parameter in the connected and disconnected correlations . here",
    "again we follow the route of ref . , where the problem was solved for the vortex correlations , and treat charges on the same footing .",
    "one easily realizes from the flow equations for the fugacities that large vortices ( charges ) with @xmath149 ( @xmath150 ) are less relevant than small vortices ( charges ) with @xmath151 ( @xmath152 ) .",
    "therefore it is a good approximation to restrict the further calculation to the small particles ( this approximation is made for simplicity , the inclusion of large particles is possible ) .",
    "the correlations can then explicitly be evaluated after introducing a auxiliary random variable @xmath153 .",
    "its distribution is defined to be gaussian with average @xmath154_{\\cal a}=0 $ ] and variance @xmath155_{\\cal a}=1/2 $ ] ( averages over @xmath153 are denoted by @xmath156_{\\cal a}$ ] ) .",
    "we decompose the core energy matrices ( [ e.k]c , d ) into @xmath157 for vortices and charges ( one specifies by adding the corresponding subscripts `` v '' or `` c '' ) .",

    "c_{\\rm con}&= & - \\left[\\frac{z_+ + z_- + 4z_+ z_-}{(1 + z_+ + z_- ) ^2 } \\right]_{\\cal a}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    then the replica limit of the flow equations ( [ flow.par ] ) for @xmath76 and @xmath112 can be taken right away , since now all dependences on @xmath56 are explicit .",
    "the contributions to the flow of the free energy ( [ flow.param]c ) can be rewritten as@xcite @xmath164_{\\cal a } \\to [ \\ln z_{\\rm v}]_{\\cal a},\\ ] ] where in the last expression the replica limit has already been performed .",
    "the analogous charge contribution is obtained by duality substitutions .",
    "combining expressions ( [ flow.param]c ) , ( [ flow.par ] ) , ( [ c.z ] ) , and ( [ f.z ] ) the flow of the physical quantities @xmath76 , @xmath112 , and @xmath165 can be expressed through the fugacities @xmath166 for both types of particles . according to eq .",
    "( [ defs.e ] ) these fugacities are small for large @xmath76 and small @xmath55 and one might be tempted to simplify the expressions ( [ c.z ] ) and ( [ f.z ] ) by a truncated expansion in these fugacities .",
    "the early studies of the disordered @xmath0 model@xcite made use of this fugacity expansion . the invalidity of this expansion was recognized later on and was considered as a possible reason for the destruction of qlro even by infinitesimally weak disorder.@xcite however , it was shown recently@xcite for the model without fields that the mere breakdown of the fugacity expansion does not imply the relevance of vortices and the destruction of qlro . in other terms : in the vortex sector the closed expressions ( [ c.z ] ) and ( [ f.z ] ) are _ finite _ and they are to be evaluated nonperturbatively .",
    "therefore it is a central issue of the present work to reexamine the validity of the fugacity expansion for charges that underlies refs . .    to be explicit let us examine the `` smallness '' of the charge fugacities @xmath167 defined in eq",
    "( [ def.z ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the real - valued vortex fugacities they are complex - valued since @xmath168 is purely imaginary . their absolute value @xmath169 is small for weak fields _ independently _ of the disorder represented by the variable @xmath153 .",
    "therefore it is safe to expand the expressions correlations ( [ c.z ] ) for charges _ before _ performing the average over @xmath153 .",

    "in contrast to the case of uniform fields , the lro phase disappears and the low - temperature qlro / sro boundary is located at @xmath306 down to @xmath296 .",
    "thus a phase with qlro now exists for @xmath307.@xcite the spin correlation function has a finite exponent ( [ eta.inf ] ) ( involving the original @xmath85 and not @xmath308 since we are interested in the correlation of @xmath45 and not of @xmath309 ) .    for temperatures @xmath310 the cardy - ostlund charges @xmath116 become relevant and still generate transverse bond disorder according to eq .",
    "( [ fix.qsro ] ) ( which also describes the further decrease of longitudinal bond disorder ) .",
    "therefore vortices become relevant again on scales ( [ l_v ] ) for @xmath310 .",
    "to summarize , we have performed a renormalization group analysis of the model ( [ h ] ) in the villain approximation that allowed us to represent the model by two coupled coulomb gases .",
    "the breakdown of the fugacity expansion for the vortex gas@xcite was treated nonperturbatively ( the flow equations contain the effective vortex fugacities @xmath185 that are nonperturbative functions of the original vortex fugacity @xmath311).@xcite we have shown that an analogous breakdown does _ not _ occur for an expansion in the charge fugacities and have identified two most relevant classes of vector charges out of an infinite set .",
    "the renormalization group flow equations for the interacting coulomb gases have been established and evaluated for the limit where both gases are dilute , i.e. , for low temperatures and weak fields .    from these flow equations",
    "we have determined the structure of the phase diagrams , in particular the domains of stability of the phase with qlro . due to the breakdown of the fugacity expansion for the vortices",
    "this phase was found to be more stable against disorder than found previously.@xcite the critical exponents @xmath209 , @xmath312 , and @xmath216 have been given in eqs .",
    "( [ eta.inf ] ) , ( [ overeta.inf ] ) , and ( [ delta.inf ] ) .    in a strict sense",
    "our approach is valid only for the characterization of the qlro phase , where vortices and fields are asymptotically irrelevant .",
    "nevertheless we have attempted to complete the picture of the phase diagram by examining how vortices and fields become relevant , which was taken as indication for the lro , qsro , or sro nature of the neighboring phases .",
    "thereby we were also able to locate qualitatively the lro / qlro transition in the case of uniform fields .",
    "this transition was found to merge one corner of the phase with qlro .",
    "its location is in qualitative agreement with that found in a recent gaussian variational approach,@xcite where vortices had not been considered . on the high - temperature side of the qlro phase vortices",
    "become relevant on relatively short length scales and immediately lead to an increase of the effective temperature and a suppression of the charge fugacities . on the low - temperature side of the qlro phase charges",
    "become relevant first . for weak longitudinal disorder ( @xmath313 ) the flow converges to a lro fixed point ,",
    "otherwise the flow tends on intermediate scales towards the qsro fixed point before it eventually crosses over to the sro fixed point .",
    "since the crossover from qsro to sro occurs at finite values of the charge fugacities , this behavior might be modified by higher orders in the charge fugacities , which we are not able to incorporate systematically at present .",
    "this difficulty excludes also the calculation of phase diagrams for uniform fields with @xmath314 and random fields with @xmath315 in the present framework .",
    "co have suggested the possibility of a first - order transition between the glassy low - temperature sro and the based on the nonglassy high - temperature sro . to our understanding",
    "this scenario was based on low - temperature properties of the vortex fugacity flow equation that are absent in the present analysis , where the vortex fugacity expansion has been avoided .",
    "we speculate that there could be a transition from a low - temperature sro phase to a high - temperature sro phase that merges the upper left corner of the qlro phase .",
    "it could be possible that this transition line persists even at very strong disorder and ends up at @xmath316 and @xmath295 .",
    "this point corresponds to the so - called gauge glass model that represents a zero - temperature critical point.@xcite however , for such a transition line we have no evidence other than the fact that corners usually occur only at a three - phase coexistence and that the gauge glass fixed point should have a continuation for weaker disorder ( finite @xmath285 )",
    ". it would be interesting to examine this scenario further , which probably can be achieved only by numerical methods .",
    "the studied model has physical applications in various fields .",
    "the most direct application is to @xmath0 magnets , where random phase disorder can be provided by nonmagnetic impurities through the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction and local crystal fields break the spin rotation symmetry.@xcite    in the case when vortices are excluded , the model also describes crystal surfaces grown on a disordered substrate.@xcite such disorder can also be related to dislocations that leave the crystal at the surface.@xcite the lro / qsro transition described above corresponds to a disorder driven transition from a rough crystal surface to a super - rough phase . in the context of planar josephson junctions@xcite",
    "lro corresponds to a finite critical current density even for arbitrarily large contacts and qsro corresponds to a critical current density that decays faster than algebraically with the contact area .",
    "the phase diagrams obtained here should also be qualitatively similar to those of crystalline films on periodic substrates with disorder@xcite and of vortex lattices.@xcite the transitions occur between phases that differ in the degree of structural order .",
    "however , these systems are more complicate to analyze in a similar framework since they have a two - component displacement field instead of the one - component phase of model ( [ h ] ) .",
    "in addition , the periodicity of the lattice implies that both the particle interactions and the pinning energy have the same wavelength , i.e. , @xmath231 .",
    "uniform and disordered fields then correspond to pinning that is commensurate or incommensurate with the crystal . since @xmath231 it appears likely that there is no phase where the effects of pinning and the proliferation of dislocations are irrelevant on large scales and that the strongly relevant fields and dislocations can not be well described by a direct generalization of the present framework .",

    "in this appendix some intermediate steps in the derivation of the coulomb gas model ( [ h.rs ] ) are given .",
    "the starting point is the effective hamiltonian ( [ h.vil ] ) .",
    "the first step is to replace the scalar field @xmath47 by the charge field @xmath56 with the use of the poisson summation formula : @xmath317 in the corresponding partition function all @xmath318 $ ] are integrated over and all @xmath319 and @xmath320 are summed over .",
    "the integrations can be extended to @xmath321 if the summation over the @xmath46 is restricted to a summation over a subset @xmath322 .",

    "the summation over the subset of @xmath322 then corresponds to a summation over the vortex density .",
    "the integration over the angles is most conveniently performed in fourier space and results in the hamiltonian ( [ h.rs ] ) . in the following",
    "we examine closer the vortex - charge interaction that reads on at an intermediate level @xmath324 note that it is not possible to choose a coulomb gauge with @xmath325 due to the integer nature of @xmath326 .",

    "let us look for simplicity at the ground state of hamiltonian ( [ h.1 ] ) in the absence of fields and disorder , @xmath331 but this is just the phase field generated by vortices , which can be written in real space ( neglecting discretization effects ) @xmath332 where @xmath333 measures the angle enclosed between the vector @xmath334 and an arbitrary reference direction in the @xmath68 plane . in direct analogy",
    "the coupling ( [ h.2 ] ) becomes ( [ h.vc ] ) in real space .",
    "@xmath335 and @xmath336 do not depend on the choice of this reference direction for vortex configurations satisfying the neutrality ( [ neutr ] ) .",
    "only these configurations have finite energy and contribute to the statistics .",
    "here we show how the angular interaction between vortices and charges induces a screening ( [ kc.screen ] ) of the interaction among charges when vortices are integrated out from the partition sum . following kosterlitz@xcite and",
    "young@xcite we integrate out every pair of vector vortices with radius less than @xmath337 .",

    "we can expand @xmath342 then it is straightforward to perform the integration over the annulus @xmath343 . after that step one can translate the vortex pair over the whole space excluding the spheres occupied by the other vector pairs and obtains a screening of charges by vortices very similar to the screening of vortices by vortices.@xcite",
