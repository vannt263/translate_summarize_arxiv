    "clustering and percolation in continuum systems are concepts of great interest in chemical physics .",
    "phenomena such as nucleation @xcite , hydrogen bonding @xcite , conductor - insulator transitions @xcite , sol - gel transitions @xcite and bridging in granular materials @xcite are frequently studied in terms of clusters and percolation @xcite .",
    "the first application of statistical mechanics formalism to describe clustering in equilibrium classical systems was done by hill @xcite . in hill s",
    "theory , the concept of cluster is directly related to the idea of bonded - pairs . a bonded - pair is a set of two particles that are linked by some direct mechanism .",
    "then , a cluster is a set of particles such that any pair of particles in the set is connected through a path of bonded - pairs .",
    "we call this clusters `` chemical clusters '' to distinguish them from the non - pair - bonded clusters we have introduced in a previous work @xcite .",
    "a system is in a percolated state if it contains a cluster that spans the system .    from hill s theory , we see that , in order to decide when two particles are bonded , a connectivity criterion is necessary .",
    "this connectivity criterion has to be defined according to the phenomenon under study @xcite . in the search for clusters of atoms in a monatomic gas that marks the onset of a phase transition ,",
    "hill proposed a simple energetic criterion : two particles are bonded if their relative kinetic energy is less than minus their relative potential energy @xcite .",
    "however , this criterion is difficult to implement from a theoretical point of view and simpler ones were preferred .",
    "the very first simplification was set by hill himself . instead of using his general criterion ,",
    "for which the relative positions and velocities of the relevant pair of particles come into account , he averaged out all the possible velocities of the particles .",
    "then , a velocity - averaged ( va ) criterion can be stated as follow : two particles are bonded with probability @xmath0 if their relative potential energy is negative .",
    "@xmath0 is calculated as an average probability over all possible relative velocities of a pair of particles @xcite .",
    "coniglio _ et .",
    "al . _ have obtained an ornstein - zernike - type relationship for the pair connectedness function @xmath1 .",
    "this function is proportional to the joint probability density of finding two particles belonging to the same cluster and at positions @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively @xcite .",
    "then , by integrating @xmath1 , the mean cluster size @xmath4 and the percolation density @xmath5 ( i.e. the value of @xmath6 for which @xmath7 diverges ) can be obtained .",
    "it is worth mentioning that most of the theoretical studies on connectivity and percolation in continuum systems ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) were focused in the rather simple stillinger s connectivity criterion @xcite .",
    "it states that two particles are bonded if they are separated by a distance shorter than a given connectivity distance @xmath8 . in this case",
    ", @xmath8 is an _",
    "ad hoc _ parameter , which must be chosen on physical grounds .",
    "although this criterion might be sensible in the study of certain insulator - conductor transitions , it is unrealistic regarding clustering in saturated vapours .",
    "more recently , hill s criterion has been reconsidered in molecular dynamics studies of small clusters @xcite and the critical percolation behaviour of lennard - jones fluids @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the percolation line @xmath9 the line that separates the temperature - density phase space into percolated and non - percolated states @xmath9 might be experimentally observable @xcite .",
    "moreover , cluster analysis based in hill s criterion seems to be useful in locating gas@xmath9liquid coexistence curves @xcite .",
    "notice that molecular dynamics simulations are mandatory if hill s criterion is used to identify clusters since monte carlo algorithms do not provide the velocities of the particles to decide whether the relative kinetic energy of the a given pair outweighs its relative potential energy .    since coniglio s theory deals only with the positions of the particles , hill s criterion can not be achieved . instead",
    ", the va criterion was used by coniglio _ et .",
    "@xcite to analytically calculate , for a potential made up of a hard core plus an attractive interaction , the percolation loci in a crude mean - field approximation .",
    "although they obtained that the percolation line ended just below the critical point , we show that this is an artefact of an additional approximation they introduced , which is not very suitable for the low temperatures involved .    in this work we present the results of a molecular dynamics ( md ) investigation of the percolation loci for a lennard - jones system by using the two previous energetic criteria , i.e. va and hill s energetic criteria .",
    "we add a maximum connectivity distance @xmath8 to the criteria to avoid unrealistic bonding .",
    "two particles separated by a distance greater than this maximum distance are considered as non - bonded even if their relative velocity is by chance zero @xcite .",
    "we show that the velocity average introduces an important overestimation on the predicted percolation density at all temperatures .",
    "therefore , the approximation introduced by this velocity average is not sensible . as a consequence ,",
    "a way to implement the full hill s connectivity criterion in an integral equation approach becomes essential for the future of these theories .",
    "here , we show how a recently developed integral equation theory for continuum percolation @xcite can be used to solve this problem .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follow . in sec .",
    "2 we describe the md simulations and show the unsuitability of the velocity average in the energetic bonding criterion . in sec .",
    "3 we briefly discuss coniglio s percolation theory and two examples of its application to the va criterion . in sec .",

    "note that this criterion can also be used in monte carlo simulations because it does not need the knowledge of the particle velocities .",
    "we also identify clusters according to stillinger s criterion for the sake of comparison . to identify the clusters from the list of bonded - pairs we use the stoddard algorithm @xcite .",
    "a system is said to be in a percolated state if a cluster that spans through the replicas is present 50 percent of the time @xcite .",

    "the coexistence curve obtained by panagiotopoulos @xcite is also included for comparison .",
    "theoretical predictions from connectedness integral equation theory are shown for va and stillinger s criteria only ( see sec . 3 ) .",
    "the two distinctive differences of the results for the two energetic criteria , as compared with the stillinger s criterion , are : i ) a strong dependence on temperature of the percolation curves and ii ) a shift towards higher densities .    as it can be seen in fig .",
    "1 , the va criterion yields higher percolation densities than hill s criterion .",
    "as it is expected , the approximation due to the average is less important as temperature drops : for low temperatures , the kinetic energy is small compared to the potential energy and an average over velocities is a good approximation .",
    "nevertheless , the overestimation of the percolation density is never small .",
    "therefore , it is expected that any theory based on the va criterion will fail in describing the proper percolation ( and in general clustering ) behaviour of simple fluids .",
    "any success should be attributed to cancellation of errors rather than accuracy of the theory . indeed",
    ", we shall see in the next section that a percus - yevick - like approximation in the connectedness ornstein@xmath9zernike integral equation yields , for the va criterion , an apparently good percolation line as compared with the full hill s criterion .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the results for the hill s criterion are similar to the ones obtained by campi _ et .",
    "_ @xcite in a more extensive md simulation .",
    "however , they obtained a faster increase in the percolation density with increasing temperature .",
    "the differences between our results and those from campi _ et .",
    "_ could be related to the small size of our system and most importantly to the criterion for deciding whether the system is percolated or not . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors considered that the system is on the percolation line if the second moment of the cluster size distribution @xmath33 that excludes the largest cluster reaches its maximum .",
    "nevertheless , we are interested in the suitability of the va bonding criterion and we expect that any criterion to calculate the percolation line might be affected to a similar extent by this simplification .",

    "based on the earlier results , it was suggested @xcite that this theory is rather satisfactory considering its simplicity because the predicted percolation line ended close to the critical point as md simulations show @xcite for the full hill connectivity criterion . however , this might be due to a cancellation of errors .",
