    "in contrast , if the origin of the mev background is non - thermal tail from seyferts ( i08 ) , we can expect several hundred seyferts at the mev band with the sensitivity limit of @xmath0 .",
    "since each seyfert is faint , we can detect only nearby ( @xmath167 ) seyferts even with the sensitivity limit of @xmath0 .",
    "if fsrqs make up the whole mev background ( a09 ) , the sensitivity of @xmath1 is needed to detect several hundreds of fsrqs at the mev gamma - ray band . however , based on the latest fsrq glf ( a12 ) , the sensitivity limit of @xmath3 , which is almost the same as the expected sensitivity of the next generation mev telescopes , would be enough to detect several hundreds of fsrqs .",
    "the difference between the two fsrq models comes from the different evolutionary history .",
    "future mev observational windows will range about three orders of magnitude in energy . with that wide energy range , the dominant population of the cosmic mev gamma - ray background radiation would change with the energy . furthermore ,",
    "as there are uncertainties of luminosity functions and spectral models , the sensitivity of several times of @xmath0 would be desirable to detect several hundred agns .",
    "it is important to know the origin of the mev background because the expected source counts depends on it . to observationally unveil the origin of the mev background , we need to resolve the sky into point sources as in soft x - ray",
    ", the expected sensitivity of the next generation mev instruments such as astrogam is @xmath168 . with this sensitivity ,",
    "the expected resolved fraction will be a few percent of the total background in the i08 seyfert scenario , while it will be @xmath55% in the a09 fsrq scenario .",
    "thus , the large fraction of the mev sky will not be resolved even with the next generation instruments . however , as about one hundred to several hundred fsrqs are expected , we will be able to obtain typical mev spectra and cosmological evolution of fsrqs and theoretically estimate their contribution to the mev background more robustly . on the other hand , it would be hard for seyferts since we can expect only about ten sources .",
    "the angular power spectrum of the mev sky will provide a unique opportunity to unveil the origin of the mev sky @xcite .",
    "the sgd onboard _ astro - h _ will be able to probe it up to 0.6  mev .",
    "although the angular power spectrum with the sensitivity of the sgd is dominated by the poisson term @xmath169 , a significant difference of the @xmath169 of seyferts @xcite and fsrqs @xcite is expected .",
    "this is because fsrqs are brighter but fewer than seyferts .",
    "anisotropies of the mev sky would allow us to understand the origin of the mev background and be useful to design future missions .",
