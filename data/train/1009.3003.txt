    "a packing is defined as a set of nonoverlapping objects arranged in a space of given dimension @xmath3 .",
    "one packing problem in @xmath3-dimensional euclidean space @xmath12 that has not been generally addressed is that of finding the maximally dense ( optimal ) packing(s ) of @xmath0 nonoverlapping @xmath3-dimensional spheres of unit diameter near ( local to ) an additional fixed central sphere such that the greatest radius @xmath13 from any of the surrounding spheres centers to the center of the fixed sphere is minimized .",
    "this problem is called the densest local packing ( dlp ) problem @xcite , and the minimized greatest radius associated with number of spheres @xmath0 is denoted by @xmath1 . in various limits , the dlp problem encompasses both the kissing number and ( infinite ) sphere packing problems @xcite .",
    "the former is a special case of the dlp problem in that the kissing number @xmath14 , or number of identical @xmath3-dimensional nonoverlapping spheres that can simultaneously be in contact with ( kiss ) a central sphere , is equal to the greatest @xmath0 for which @xmath15 , and the latter is equivalent to the dlp problem in the limit that @xmath16 .",
    "the dlp problem for @xmath17 spheres in @xmath7 dates back to a debate between newton and gregory in 1694 .",
    "newton believed that only @xmath18 identical spheres could simultaneously contact a central same - size sphere , while gregory believed the correct number to be @xmath17 . the first rigorous proof that newton was right came in 1953 @xcite , followed by a more concise proof in 1956 @xcite .",
    "however , the question remains : how close can @xmath17 identical spheres come to a central same - size sphere - how good was gregory s guess ? in another paper @xcite , we showed that for any @xmath3 , the dlp optimal packings in @xmath12 with @xmath19 , @xmath20 the golden ratio , include packings where all @xmath0 sphere centers lie on a spherical surface of radius @xmath1 .",
    "the smallest radius spherical surface onto which the centers of @xmath17 spheres of unit diameter can be placed is strongly conjectured to be @xmath21 , with the centers arranged in a structure first documented in @xcite .",
    "it appears that though gregory was incorrect in conjecturing @xmath22 to be @xmath17 , his guess was nt particularly far - off .    for each @xmath0 in the dlp problem in @xmath12",
    ", there is a single optimal @xmath1 , though generally for a given @xmath0 there can be multiple distinct packings that achieve this radius . in the predecessor to this paper @xcite , hereafter referred to as paper i , we studied the optimal packings and corresponding @xmath1 for the dlp problem in @xmath5 for @xmath23 to @xmath24 and for @xmath0 corresponding to full shells of the triangular lattice from @xmath25 to @xmath6 .",
    "we also discussed the general concepts and applications associated with dlp optimal packings for arbitrary @xmath0 and @xmath3 .    in paper",
    "i , we reported that a majority of the dlp optimal packings in @xmath26 contain rattlers , or spheres ( disks ) that can be displaced in at least one direction without increasing @xmath1 or displacing any other sphere ( disk ) in the packing .",
    "further , we found that many optimal packings contain cavities at their centers in which the central disk , were it not fixed , could move freely ( as a rattler , or object in a packing that can be displaced without displacing any other objects or the packing boundary ) .",
    "the optimal packings in @xmath26 also exhibit a wide range of rotational symmetries , particularly for smaller @xmath0 , and packings of @xmath0 spheres from certain classes such as the curved @xcite and wedge hexagonal packings were found to be optimal at various @xmath0 .",
    "we additionally observed that as @xmath0 grows large , disks in the _ bulk _ ( as opposed to on the surface ) of dlp optimal packings are largely arranged as subsets of the densest infinite packing in @xmath5 , i.e. , with centers on the sites of the triangular lattice , whereas disks farthest from the central sphere ( centers at distance @xmath1 ) tend to form circular rings .",
    "the dlp problem is related to problems of finding arrangements of @xmath8 points @xmath27 that minimize potential energy . defining the dlp potential energy as the negative of the density of @xmath8 spheres ( including the central sphere ) contained completely within the _ encompassing sphere _ , a sphere of radius @xmath28 centered on the central sphere , the dlp problem becomes a minimal - energy problem with the pair potential between points ( sphere centers ) exhibiting features of long - range attraction and infinite short - range repulsion .",
    "comparisons between dlp optimal packings and minimal - energy configurations for @xmath8 points with pair potentials exhibiting similar features of long - range attraction and short - range repulsion indicate that , though minimal energies for certain values of @xmath0 are similar , optimal configurations of points ( sphere centers ) are in general completely different .",
    "this finding could have implications for nucleation theory , as is discussed in more detail in secs .",
    "[ minenergysection ] and [ conclusions ] .",
    "the dlp problem is relevant to the realizability of functions that are candidates to be the pair correlation function of a packing of identical spheres . for a statistically homogeneous and isotropic packing , the pair correlation function",
    "is denoted by @xmath29 ; it is proportional to the probability density of finding a separation @xmath30 between any two sphere centers and normalized such that it takes the value of unity when no spatial correlations between centers are present .",
    "specifically , no function can be the pair correlation function of a point process ( where a packing of spheres of unit diameter is a point processes with a minimum pair separation distance of unity ) unless it meets certain necessary , but generally not sufficient , conditions known as realizability conditions @xcite .",
    "two of these conditions that appear to be particularly strong for the realizability of sphere packings @xcite are the nonnegativity of @xmath29 and its corresponding structure factor @xmath31 , where @xmath32 with number density @xmath33 and @xmath34 the @xmath3-dimensional fourier transform of the total correlation function @xmath35 .",
    "knowledge of the maximal number of sphere centers that may fit within radius @xmath13 from an additional fixed sphere s center , where that maximal number , denoted by @xmath36 , is equal to the greatest @xmath0 in the dlp problem for which @xmath37 , may be employed to construct a third realizability condition , called the @xmath38 condition @xcite , on @xmath29 .",
    "this condition is written @xmath39 where @xmath40 is defined for a statistically homogeneous packing as the expected number of sphere centers within distance @xmath13 from an arbitrary sphere center .",
    "the function @xmath40 can be related to the pair correlation function @xmath29 , where for a packing of spheres with a pair correlation function @xmath41 that is direction - dependent , @xmath29 is the directional average of @xmath42 , by @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ zr ] ) , @xmath33 is the constant number density of sphere centers and @xmath44 is the surface area of a sphere of radius @xmath30 in @xmath12 , @xmath45 as was discussed in previous papers @xcite , the @xmath38 realizability condition has been shown to encode information not included in the nonnegativity conditions on pair correlation functions and their corresponding structure factors alone .",
    "the maximal infinite - volume packing fraction @xmath46 of identical nonoverlapping spheres in @xmath12 can be bounded from above by employing knowledge of the optimal @xmath1 in the dlp problem , where a _ packing fraction _ is the fraction of a given space covered by nonoverlapping objects . as was discussed in paper",
    "i , an upper bound is constructed by measuring the packing fraction @xmath47 as the fraction of the volume of the encompassing sphere covered by the @xmath8 spheres of unit diameter , @xmath48 in the first equality in ( [ packingfraction ] ) , @xmath13 is the greatest radius from any of the @xmath0 surrounding spheres centers to the center of the central sphere , and in the second equality , the number density @xmath33 is the fraction of a sphere of radius @xmath47 covered by the @xmath8 spheres of unit diameter and @xmath49 is the standard gamma function .    for small numbers of spheres ( @xmath50 ) in low dimensions ( @xmath51 ) ,",
    "an algorithm combining a nonlinear programming method with a stochastic search of configuration space can be employed on a personal computer to find putative solutions to the dlp problem .",
    "the accuracy of the solutions found by such an algorithm is bounded only by a machine s precision , and in general higher accuracy only requires more computation time . using such an algorithm , the details of which",
    "are described in paper i , we find and present putatively - optimal dlp packings and their corresponding @xmath1 in @xmath7 for @xmath52 to @xmath53 ( accuracy of at least @xmath54 sphere diameters ) , and for selected values of @xmath0 from @xmath55 to @xmath2 ( accuracy of at least @xmath56 sphere diameters ) .",
    "images and coordinates for many of the optimal packings that we have found are located on our website @xcite .",
    "of the @xmath57 studied , some are randomly chosen and some correspond to the numbers of contacting spheres of unit diameter near and equal to the number in subsets of face - centered - cubic ( fcc ) and hexagonal - close - packed ( hcp ) packings with a given number of full coordination shells .    in @xmath7 as in @xmath5 , rigorous and repeated testing of the algorithm indicates that it is robust in finding dlp optimal packings .",
    "the identification of rotation and reflection symmetry , spatially precise to @xmath54 or better sphere diameters , in numerous dlp presumed - optimal packings in @xmath7 for @xmath58 supports this conclusion , as does our finding that the minimal @xmath13 found for @xmath59 to @xmath60 and for @xmath61 are smaller than the ( previously ) best - known minimal radii @xcite for the less - restrictive problem of finding the minimal radius ( larger ) sphere into which @xmath8 spheres of unit diameter may be packed .",
    "however , the algorithm is dependent upon initial conditions , and as the number @xmath0 of spheres increases , an increasing number of trials have been necessary before we have found a packing and corresponding @xmath1 that with a high degree of confidence we consider optimal . for this reason , due to computing time constraints",
    ", though we strongly conjecture that the vast majority of our packings are optimal for @xmath62 , as many as @xmath63 or more of packings for @xmath64 may not be strictly optimal ( though we hereafter refer to them as optimal ) .",
    "for these packings , we will present evidence indicating that the smallest radius @xmath13 found for each @xmath65 is very near to the optimal @xmath1 , if not equal to it .    over the range of @xmath0 studied , dlp",
    "optimal packings in @xmath7 differ substantially in terms of symmetry , contact networks , and spatial positioning from the barlow packings @xcite , which we recall are the maximally dense infinite packings of identical nonoverlapping spheres in @xmath7 . in general",
    ", we find that optimal packings are dominated by the dense arrangement of spheres on their surface , i.e. , those spheres with centers at precisely distance @xmath1 , where the arrangement of the spheres in the bulk ( interior ) is of secondary importance .",
    "similarly in @xmath5 , dlp optimal packings differ substantially from packings of contacting disks arranged on the points of a triangular lattice , though in both dimensions at sufficiently large @xmath0 , the spheres in the bulk of each optimal packing begin to always resemble , respectively , a subset of a corresponding maximally dense infinite packing in @xmath5 or @xmath7 .    in @xmath5 , the approximate @xmath0 and corresponding @xmath1 at which this change occurs",
    "may be identified visually by perusing the dlp optimal packings at various @xmath0 . in @xmath7",
    "however , it can be difficult to visually compare distinct packings .",
    "consequently , we here introduce the concept of a _ similarity metric _ , defined as a metric designed to quantify the degree of similarity between one set of points and a reference set .",
    "as will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ scandbarlow ] , using such a metric allows quantitative comparisons of the relative degree of similarity between the radial spatial positions of spheres configured as dlp optimal packings and of spheres configured as subsets of a maximally dense infinite packing .",

    "considering , for example , the spheres forming the cavity wall in dlp optimal packings in @xmath7 with cavities around the central sphere , it is clear that not every sphere in a packing can have the maximal number @xmath36 of sphere centers within distance @xmath13 from its center ( except for @xmath13 such that @xmath160 , where the barlow packings realize this criterion ) .",
    "however , as any single ( solute ) sphere can have the maximal number of ( solvent ) sphere centers within distance @xmath13 from its center , a @xmath40 defined in terms of a cross - correlation function of a single central sphere can be equal to @xmath36 at any @xmath13 .",
    "otherwise expressed , for @xmath161 any realizable cross - correlation function between nonoverlapping spherical solute molecules of unit diameter ( of type @xmath162 ) in the dilute limit and same - size spherical solvent molecules ( of type @xmath163 ) , @xmath164 where the notation @xmath165 indicates the mathematical supremum .",
    "the function @xmath36 is thus a significantly more restrictive upper bound for candidate cross - correlation functions of a single solute sphere amongst same - size solvent spheres than for candidate pair correlation functions of packings of indistinguishable spheres .",
    "the characteristics of dlp optimal packings in each dimension @xmath3 are heavily dependent on the underlying differences in packing spheres densely in @xmath4 .",
    "for example , in @xmath5 there is a unique arrangement of @xmath166 disks in contact with a central disk , whereas in @xmath7 there are a continuum of arrangements of @xmath167 spheres in contact with a central sphere . in @xmath5 , there is a unique densest infinite packing of disks and in @xmath7 , there are an uncountably infinite number of densest infinite packings of spheres .",
    "differences in characteristics across dimension are also driven by the existence of particularly locally dense dimensionally - unique packings . in @xmath5 , these include the wedge hexagonal packings described in paper i and the curved hexagonal packings @xcite , the densest local packings for @xmath168 , @xmath169 . in @xmath7 , they include the two perfectly icosahedrally symmetric packings for @xmath109 and @xmath110 ( table [ icostable ] ) that contain only two and four shells , respectively .",
    "it is curious to note that both the curved hexagonal packings and the perfectly icosahedrally symmetric packings for @xmath109 and @xmath110 are composed of a relatively small number of densely - packed shells of spheres ; however , in the curved hexagonal packings , the spheres in any given shell are in contact with one another whereas in the aforementioned perfectly icosahedrally symmetric packings , they are not .",
    "dimensions four , eight and twenty - four are similar to dimension two in that in each of these dimensions there is a unique ( uniqueness is conjectured for @xmath170 and proved for @xmath78 and @xmath79@xcite ) arrangement of spheres with kissing numbers @xmath171 ( recently proved by musin in @xcite ) , @xmath172 , and @xmath173 .",
    "the densest known packings in dimensions four , eight , and twenty - four are also conjectured to be unique , and each is a lattice packing that is self - dual , i.e. , its reciprocal lattice is itself ( the dual of the triangular lattice is similarly a triangular lattice , though resized and rotated @xmath111 degrees ) .",
    "the self - duality of the @xmath174 ( @xmath78 ) and leech ( @xmath79 ) lattices has been exploited to prove , up to a very small numerical tolerance , that identical nonoverlapping spheres with centers on the sites of these lattices are the densest packings of spheres in their respective dimensions @xcite . in dimension five ,",
    "the densest known packings can be described , similarly to barlow packings , as stackings of layers of the densest packings in @xmath175 .",
    "consequently , we might expect to find dlp optimal packings in @xmath12 , @xmath170 , @xmath148 , and @xmath176 similar to the curved hexagonal packings in @xmath5 , whereas we would not expect to find such optimal packings in @xmath177 .",
    "these and other dimension - dependent dense packing characteristics could have an effect on the probability of freezing in a overcompressed liquid of hard spheres in @xmath12 .",
    "recent work @xcite suggests that the phase transition from a overcompressed hard - sphere liquid in @xmath7 to a crystalline solid with sphere centers near to the sites of the spheres centers in a barlow packing may be described as a two - stage process . in the first stage ,",
    "small clusters of spheres form that are denser than either the liquid or crystalline solid states . in the second stage ,",
    "the dense clusters grow in size and decrease in density while their bulk ( interior ) transforms from the center outward into a crystalline solid state @xcite .",
    "an analogy can be drawn between dlp optimal packings in @xmath7 for smaller @xmath0 and the small clusters , in that both are locally denser than corresponding subsets of barlow packings or crystalline solid states and in that neither are similar ( both angularly and radially ) to small subsets of barlow packings .",
    "a similar analogy applies between dlp optimal packings for sufficiently large @xmath0 and the larger clusters with crystalline solid interiors , in that both are very similar to barlow packings in their bulk and not similar on and near their surfaces .    in general , the probability per unit time of freezing in hard - sphere liquids at comparable overcompression decreases with increasing dimension , at least for dimensions two through six @xcite .",
    "however , with the previously described two - stage process in mind , consideration of the dimension - dependent characteristics of the densest local packings could lead to a further increase , beyond what might otherwise be predicted by the general trend , in estimates of the probability per unit time of freezing in @xmath5 as compared to in @xmath7 .    for example , unlike in @xmath7 , in @xmath5",
    "there are several values of @xmath178 , specifically , @xmath179 , @xmath111 and @xmath180 , for which one of the densest local packings is a subset of the densest infinite packing , and therefore for which the equality in the upper bound ( [ zrbound ] ) can hold . we might expect to see this occurring in @xmath175 , @xmath181 , or @xmath182 as well , but not in @xmath177 .",
    "the equivalence of densest local packings at certain @xmath0 and subsets of the densest infinite packing in @xmath5 suggests that the first stage of the two - stage crystallization process , in which small clusters of spheres form that are denser than either the liquid or crystalline solid states , may be shortened in duration for hard - disk liquids in @xmath5 relative to hard - sphere liquids in @xmath7 . if this is the case , accounting for the equivalence of densest local packings and subsets of the densest infinite packings should result in an increase in the probability per unit time of freezing in @xmath5 and potentially @xmath175 , @xmath181 , and @xmath182 as compared to in @xmath7 and @xmath177 . for hard - sphere liquids at densities near the freezing point , in @xmath5 relative to in @xmath7 , the more pronounced `` shoulder '' @xcite appearing in pair correlation functions between the first and second nearest - neighbor distances",
    "could be evidence indicating such a shortened first stage .",
    "this example and the similarities between dlp optimal packings and the nuclei described in the two - stage description of crystallization suggest that there may be an explicit connection between freezing in overcompressed hard - sphere liquids and dlp optimal packings .",
    "it would be interesting , in the context of a revised nucleation theory , to explore the relationship between nucleation and dense local clusters of spheres configured with centers near the sites of sphere centers in the densest local packings .",

    "more generally , the value of @xmath190 can be significantly reduced by investigating the geometric considerations of placing the @xmath8 spheres of any dlp optimal packing of radius @xmath1 into the void created by removing @xmath0 spheres from a barlow packing . reducing @xmath190 to a minimum possible value @xmath198 results in the lower bound @xmath199 .",
    "any set of @xmath8 spheres in a given @xmath156 can be used as a reference set in the similarity metric ( [ simmetric ] ) . however , for @xmath200 , there are always multiple reference sets of @xmath8 spheres that will produce the same @xmath201 and consequently the same value of @xmath124 for a given comparison set . for example , as the metric ( [ simmetric ] ) is insensitive to the angular position of any sphere , for a furthest coordination shell that is not full , the same @xmath201 is produced regardless of which of the spheres in the furthest shell is included in the packing used as a reference set .",
    "when these and all other degeneracies are taken into account , we find that for @xmath156 including only packings of @xmath202 , and @xmath17 barlow stacking layers , where all @xmath203 packings are constructed from @xmath17 layers , there are @xmath204 and @xmath205 distinct sets @xmath201 . for",

    "an intuitive analysis of the determination of the shells @xmath201 suggests that the presence of relatively fewer shells in a reference set can generally increase the value of @xmath124 .",
    "an increase of this sort does occur when shells are of radial width large enough such that the number of sphere centers within each shell approaches the number density of the packing , i.e. , when radial width is on the order of a sphere s diameter .",
