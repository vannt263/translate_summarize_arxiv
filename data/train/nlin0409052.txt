    "the theta model @xcite , which is derived as a canonical model for neurons near a ` saddle - node on a limit cycle ' bifurcation , assumes the state of the neuron is given by an angle @xmath0 , with @xmath1 , @xmath2 corresponding to the ` firing ' state , and the dynamics described by @xmath3 where @xmath4 represents the inputs to the neuron .",
    "when @xmath5 this model describes an ` excitable ' neuron , which in the absence of external input ( @xmath6 ) approaches a rest state , while if @xmath7 this represents an ` oscillatory ' neuron which performs spontaneous oscillations in the absence of external input .",

    "it is naturally assumed that @xmath11 decays at infinity ( precise assumptions will be presented later ) .",
    "the above model , in the case @xmath25 , is the one presented in @xcite . in the case @xmath26 this model is the one presented in @xcite ( remark 2 ) and @xcite .",
    "we always assume @xmath27 .    when the geometry is linear , @xmath28 , it is natural to seek travelling waves of activity along the line in which each neuron makes one or more oscillations and then approaches rest , or even where each neuron oscillates infinitely many times .",
    "in @xcite it was proven that for sufficiently strong synaptic coupling @xmath22 , at least two such waves , a slow and a fast one , exist , and also that they always involve each neuron firing more than one time before it approaches rest , while for sufficiently small @xmath22 such waves do not exist .",
    "it was not determined how many times each neuron fires before coming to rest , and it may even be that each neuron fires infinitely many times .",
    "some numerical results in the case of a one and a two - dimensional geometry were obtained in @xcite .",
    "at least as far as can be gleaned from these simulations , it seems likely that , starting with initial conditions in which a small patch of tissue is depolarized , more and more of the neurons start oscillating , so it may be that the large - time behavior is described by a * periodic travelling wave*. this motivates the study of periodic travelling waves , with infinitely many spikes .",
    "these are solutions of ( [ de]),([syn ] ) which take the form @xmath29 @xmath30 where the functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 satisfy @xmath33 for some integer @xmath34 , called the winding number , and @xmath35 @xmath36 is the wave - number and @xmath37 is the frequency .",
    "the wavelength of the travelling wave is given by @xmath38 the time - period is given by @xmath39 and the wave - velocity is given by @xmath40 in this formulation the spike - times of the neuron located at @xmath16 are the values @xmath41 for which @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is an integer .",
    "it is thus not assumed that the spike - times are equally spaced , but as we shall prove below ( lemma [ nspikes ] ) they form a periodic sequence in the sense that @xmath44 , so that the winding number @xmath34 is the number of spike events for each neuron in the duration of a period @xmath45 .",
    "we note here that periodic travelling waves have already been studied in the context of one - dimensional integrate - and - fire neural networks @xcite , in which case it was possible to obtain quite explicit analytical results .",
