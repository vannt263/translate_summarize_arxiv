    "in recent years there has been a revival of the research interest in random access protocols , instigated by the growth of machine - to - machine ( m2 m ) communications .",
    "this is particularly valid for cellular networks , where the random access mechanisms are used to establish the initial connection between the terminals and the base station ( bs ) , and facilitate access to data services .",
    "cellular random access is commonly based on the traditional slotted aloha ( sa ) , a simple distributed access method that provides satisfactory performance for human - oriented traffic .",
    "however , the m2 m traffic has fundamentally different requirements , primarily seen in the expected number of accessing terminals , and using traditional sa may create bottlenecks already in the access network .    a promising approach for enhancing the performance of sa by using interference cancellation ( ic )",
    "was demonstrated recently in @xcite . in brief ,",
    "application of ic potentially unlocks the collision slots , radically boosting the throughput of sa . of a particular importance",
    "is liva s paper @xcite , where it was shown that the use of successive ic in sa for recovering user transmissions is analogous to the iterative belief - propagation ( bp ) erasure decoding , promoting the use of the erasure coding theory to design `` coded slotted aloha '' schemes .    despite the similarities",
    ", there are important differences between erasure coding and sa with ic due to the effects of the wireless medium in the latter .",
    "when the power of one of the colliding signals is stronger than the rest , a capture effect may occur , i.e. , the corresponding transmission may be successfully received .",
    "therefore , the capture effect may significantly affect both the access scheme design and performance , as the collision slots may potentially be exploited both through captures and ic .",
    "in that case , the analysis and design of coded sa schemes requires incorporation of the capture effect in the model that is inspired by erasure coding .",
    "a brief treatment of the capture effect in coded sa was presented in @xcite , introducing the general modification of the and - or tree evaluation @xcite , a tool used to assess the asymptotic performance of the erasure codes when decoded by the iterative bp algorithm .",
    "this analysis was extended further in @xcite , showing how to actually evaluate the asymptotic performance of coded sa for narrowband systems and rayleigh fading .    besides the work on mac random access protocols there has also been a renewed interest in multi - user detection ( mud ) in the context of random access . in classical mud",
    ", it is assumed that the set of active users is known a priori and the focus on reliable data detection .",
    "however , in random access schemes the main ingredient is the uncertainty about the set of active users , such that both the user activity as well as data have to be estimated . considering that the setup leads to so - called _ sporadic communication",
    "_ the active users only constitute a small subset of all users , such that the problem is inherently sparse and motivates the use of compressive sensing ( cs ) to facilitate a low - overhead phy scheme for low data rate m2 m communication .",
    "this novel compressive sensing based multi - user detection ( cs - mud ) achieves a joint detection of activity and data of the subset of active users in a slot and exhibits performance close to the genie - upper bound when the user activities are known a priori @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the coded sa with capture effect in broadband , mud systems , which , to the best of our knowledge , has not been analyzed in the literature available so far .",
    "first , we show how to generally model and incorporate the capture effect in mud systems into the and - tree evaluation , applicable to any coded slotted aloha scheme . in the next step ,",
    "we deviate from the simple phy - layer , commonly used in aloha schemes , and introduce the details of the receiver based on cs - mud .",
    "finally , we apply the obtained analytical and numerical results to the frameless aloha , a simple but effective variant of coded sa @xcite , and demonstrate how the capture effect and features of the cs - mud impact the design and performance of the scheme .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : background ] introduces the most important concepts of coded sa and capture effect .",
    "section  [ sec : sysmod ] elaborates the system model .",
    "the analysis of the proposed access method is performed in section  [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "section  [ sec : performance ] presents the asymptotic performance of frameless aloha with cs - mud .",
    "finally , the paper is concluded in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the basic principles of coded sa are illustrated in the example presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : csa]a ) . the contention process is depicted by a bipartite graph , where nodes on the left represent users ( i.e. , contending terminals ) , the nodes on the right represent slots , and the edges connect users with the slots in which they transmitted ( for instance , user @xmath0 transmitted in slots @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) .",
    "each time the user makes a transmission , it is the replica of the same data packet that , in addition , contains the information in which slots the other replicas occurred . in traditional sa with no capture effect , only the singleton slot @xmath2 is usable and the packet of @xmath0 becomes recovered , denoted by ( i ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : csa]a ) ; the collision slots @xmath1 and @xmath3 and the idle slot @xmath4 are wasted . on the other hand ,",
    "the use of interference cancellation allows for removal of packet replica of @xmath0 from @xmath1 ( ii ) , which reduces @xmath1 to a singleton slot and enables recovery of the packet of @xmath5 ( iii ) . in the same way",
    ", the packet replica of @xmath5 is removed from @xmath3 using ic ( iv ) , enabling recovery of the packet of @xmath6 ( v ) .",
    "the above representation and the successive application of ic are analogous to the representation of codes - on - graphs and iterative bp erasure - decoding .",
    "we now briefly introduce the notation used in the rest of the paper .",
    "denote users by @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and slots by @xmath9 , @xmath10 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : csa]b ) .",
    "by @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) denote the degree of @xmath7 ( @xmath9 ) , where the degree is the number of edges incident to the node .",
    "further , denote by @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) the probability that a degree of user ( slot ) node is @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "an important feature of coded sa is that one can design only the user degrees @xmath11 , @xmath8 , while the slot degrees @xmath12 , @xmath10 , are random , being outcomes of the contending process .",
    "a typical assumption is that users select slots in which they transmit with a uniform probability @xcite .",
    "this implies that @xmath12 , @xmath10 , are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) , i.e. , @xmath17 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the probabilities @xmath18 , @xmath19 , can be approximated by a poisson distribution : @xmath20 where @xmath21 $ ] , @xmath22 , i.e. , @xmath23 is the average slot degree .",
    "the same assumption is typically used in sporadic communication setups with cs - mud @xcite , enabling the combination of the two approaches .      as already stated in the introductory section ,",
    "a capture effect occurs when one or more user transmissions may become recovered despite the interference originating from other users . in narrowband systems",
    ", the capture effect leads to recovery of a single user transmission , while in broadband mud systems it may lead to recovery of more than just one transmission .",
    "the capture effect has been extensively studied in the traditional sa framework , both in narrowband and in broadband systems ; c.f .",
    "a typical premise is that the capture occurs for all transmissions whose signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) is above capture threshold @xmath24 , where @xmath25 for narrowband , and @xmath26 for broadband systems @xcite .",
    "however , the features of the cs - mud receiver studied in this paper and presented in detail in section  [ sec : cs - mud ] , can not be described by such a simplistic model . specifically , the considered receiver exploits compressive sensing , and its performance depends on the sparsity of the input observation , as well as the correlation among users spreading sequences and noise .",
    "we note that these dependencies pose significant analytical difficulties and we therefore numerically evaluate the capture probabilities for the cs - mud receiver and the scenario of interest , as presented in section  [ sec : captureprobability ] .",
    "in this paper we adopt the frameless aloha strategy @xcite .",
    "we assume that there are @xmath27 users in the system , synchronized on a slot basis .",
    "the users contend for the access to the base station ( bs ) by transmitting replicas of the same packet in randomly selected slots of the contention period .",
    "the start and end of the contention period are denoted by downlink beacons sent by the bs , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m2 m ] .",
    "the duration of the contention period in slots , denoted by @xmath28 , is a priori unknown and chosen such that the expected throughput is maximized .",
    "every user transmits with a predefined activation probability @xmath29 in every slot of the contention period , where @xmath23 is a suitably chosen constant .",
    "therefore , the probabilities @xmath13 are the same for all users @xmath7 , and it can be shown that : @xmath30 where @xmath31 . the average user degree is : @xmath32 = ( 1 + \\epsilon)\\beta , \\ ; 1 \\leq i \\leq n.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to ease the following analytical as well as numerical investigations the following assumptions are made : ( i ) the user channels are assumed to be i.i.d",
    ".  and constant for the duration of a contention period , ( ii ) channel state information is perfectly known at the bs and ( iii ) the received power of all users is the same on average , e.g. , through power control .      in every slot @xmath9 , @xmath10 , the bs receives and stores the composite signal @xmath33 , which combines the colliding transmissions and the noise , and executes the following steps :    1 .",
    "all previously recovered transmissions whose replicas occur in @xmath9 ( if there are such ) , are removed from @xmath9 , i.e. , the bs performs the _ inter - slot _ ic .",
    "2 .   the bs applies the cs - mud algorithm .",
    "the bs removes all the newly recovered transmissions in step 2 ) from @xmath9 , i.e. , performs _ intra - slot _ ic .",
    "the bs removes all the replicas of the newly recovered transmissions in step 2 ) from all the previous slots where they occur , i.e. , performs _ inter - slot _ ic in @xmath34 , @xmath35 . 5 .",
    "the bs repeats steps 2)-4 ) until there are no newly recovered transmissions in @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , steps 2)-5 ) are also executed on all the slots @xmath34 , @xmath35 , that experienced inter - slot ic in previous runs , potentially resulting with new candidate slots on which the same operation cycle , i.e. , cs - mud , intra- and inter - slot ic , is executed again .",
    "the processing at the bs ultimately stops when there are no new slots affected by the inter - slot ic .",
    "an assumption made in this paper is that both inter- and intra - slot ic are perfect , i.e. , the recovered transmissions and their replicas are removed leaving no residual interference .      for a general introduction to cs - mud in sporadic communication",
    "please refer to @xcite . here , we focus on a summary of the most important parts .",
    "we model the physical layer transmission through a typical simplified synchronous baseband description , in which a linear input - output relation is used to express the multi - user wireless transmission in slot @xmath9 @xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath37 summarizes the influences of channel and medium access .",
    "the stacked multi - user vector @xmath38 contains all symbols from all @xmath27 user nodes in one slot , independent of their activity in that slot . due to the probabilistic activity of users ,",
    "i.e. , the number of active users in one slot is given by the random slot degree , the activity in the system is unknown at the bs and needs to be estimated .",
    "accordingly , inactive users who do not transmit any data are modeled as `` transmitting '' a frame of @xmath39 zeros .",
    "active users transmit frames of @xmath39 data symbols from a discrete modulation alphabet @xmath40 .",
    "thus , the elements of the multi - user vector are @xmath41 with @xmath42 being the so - called _ augmented _ alphabet given by @xmath43 . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that bpsk is applied in our system , which leads to @xmath44 . however , this is not a general restriction and higher order modulations are easily incorporated .",
    "finally , @xmath45 denotes additive white gaussian noise with zero mean and variance @xmath46 and the vector @xmath33 represents the measurements of the signal @xmath38 available at the receiver in slot @xmath9 .    in sporadic communication",
    "the basic assumption is intermittent ( sporadic ) user activity , which usually leads to a small number of active users compared to the total number of users . here",
    ", the sa scheme determines how many users are accessing a slot at any given time , which may lead to less sparse systems compared to the current cs - mud literature .",
    "nonetheless , many elements in @xmath38 may be zero or , more specifically , block - zero in blocks of @xmath39 consecutive symbols . in cs literature this property",
    "is called `` block - sparse '' and enables improved detection algorithms which exploit this structure .",
    "thus , the sparse multi - user detection problem can be solved by cs , which facilitates a joint activity and data detection .",
    "a very interesting feature of this cs - mud is that may even be highly under - determined .",
    "the reconstruction of @xmath38 from the noisy received signal @xmath33 is still possible due to the sparsity of @xmath38 .",
    "for the remainder of the paper , cdma will be applied as an exemplary medium access scheme , which is quite attractive for m2 m communications due to its adaptive and flexible support of different number of devices , as well as variable quality of service .",
    "specifically , @xmath37 describes the spreading of @xmath38 by user - specific real - valued pn sequences , which are assumed to be known at the bs and could serve as a user i d .",
    "all transmitted frames are assumed to have the same length of @xmath47 chips after spreading each of the @xmath39 symbols by a pn sequence with spreading factor @xmath48 . here",
    ", the spreading factor @xmath48 determines the resource efficiency of the phy layer .",
    "as the slot degree @xmath16 is typically much smaller than @xmath27 , we choose @xmath49 , which leads to an overloaded cdma system . in this case , is an under - determined linear equation system .",
    "further , the matrix @xmath37 also describes the convolution with the user - specific channel impulse responses @xmath50 of length of @xmath51 .",
    "after convolution @xmath52 chips will be received .",
    "thus , @xmath53 summarizes both the spreading and channel convolution .",
    "the details of cs - mud algorithms are not our main focus and readers who are interested may refer to @xcite . in order to have reasonable complexity and exploit the discussed group sparsity , we choose the well studied group orthogonal matching pursuit ( gomp ) as our detection algorithm .",
    "usually , physical layer algorithms are analyzed by bit or frame error rate plots over the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "however , here we are more interested in the capture probability of this specific phy layer setup for the overall evaluation of coded random access with cs - mud . in section  [ sec : captureprobability ] , we will detail how these probabilities are numerically obtained .",
    "for the general introduction to the and - or tree evaluation in the erasure coding framework , we refer the reader to @xcite . hereafter , we focus on the most relevant aspects that are subject to the properties of the proposed access method and the cs - mud receiver . and - or tree evaluation provides the asymptotic probability ( i.e. , when number of users @xmath54 ) of user transmission recovery",
    ". the evaluation is based on the graph that represents the contention process , fig .",
    "[ fig : csa]b ) , and it is performed via iterative updates of the probabilities of transmission recoveries over the corresponding graph edges . as elaborated in section  [ sec : sysmod ] , the access strategy is uniform both over users and slots , users channels are statistically equivalent , and the expected received powers for all users are the same .",
    "therefore , we can model the and - or tree evaluation through a message exchanges among a referent ( exemplary ) user and slot , depicted in fig .  [",

    "therefore , the probability @xmath56 that a replica corresponding to the outgoing edge _ is not _ recovered is @xmath57 , i.e. , the outgoing edge is not recovered if all the incoming edges are not recovered .",
    "averaging over user degrees yields : @xmath58 where @xmath59 denotes the probability that an edge is connected to a user node of degree @xmath15 , which can be calculated as @xcite : @xmath60 for frameless aloha , using and transforms into : @xmath61        the analysis of the probability updates performed in slots is more involved , due to the way that receiver operates .",
    "the probability that the outgoing edge _ is _ recovered is : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the number of unrecovered incoming edges , @xmath64 is the number of incoming edges that have been recovered in other slots and removed via inter - slot ic , @xmath65 is the probability that the outgoing edge is recovered when @xmath63 unrecovered edges remain , and @xmath66 is a combinatorial argument representing the symmetry of the problem setting .",
    "we deal with computation of @xmath65 in section  [ sec : c(t ) ] .    averaging over slot degrees yields : @xmath67 where @xmath68 denotes the probability that an edge is connected to a slot of degree @xmath16 @xcite : @xmath69 combining , and yields : @xmath70    finally",
    ", the and - or tree evaluation is performed in an iterative manner : @xmath71 where the subscript denotes the iteration number , and @xmath72 and @xmath73 are given by and , respectively .",
    "the probability of user transmission recovery is : @xmath74 a central measure of system efficiency is the throughput @xmath75 , defined as the number of recovered users within @xmath28 slots of the contention period .",
    "@xmath75 can be computed as : @xmath76      assume that @xmath77 users are active in the slot , i.e. , there are @xmath78 interfering transmissions from the perspective of the referent outgoing edge .",
    "denote by @xmath79 the probability that @xmath80 users out of @xmath77 have been recovered from the slot using cs - mud .",
    "further , by @xmath81 denote the probability of the event that among these @xmath80 is the user that corresponds to the outgoing edge .",
    "likewise , by @xmath82 denote the event among @xmath80 recovered users is not the one corresponding to the outgoing edge . obviously : @xmath83 the recovery of the outgoing edge can happen in any chain of fortunate successive applications of the cs - mud and the intra - slot ic , as elaborated in section  [ sec : bs ] , which can be stated as : @xmath84 where @xmath55 is the number of intra - slot ic steps and : @xmath85 in other words , the pivotal idea in is that the chain of the events , whose probabilities constitute summands , ends up with the outgoing edge being recovered .",
    "as all the transmissions colliding in the slots are statistically equivalent , probabilities @xmath86 can be obtained from @xmath87 in the following way : @xmath88 for @xmath89 and @xmath90 ; @xmath82 can be obtained using .",
    "the analytical derivation of probabilities @xmath87 for the considered cs - mud receiver represent a formidable task that is out of the paper scope .",
    "instead , we obtain them numerically , as described in the next subsection .",
    "we focus on the physical layer processing with cs - mud in one slot , as described in section  [ sec : cs - mud ] .",
    "in general , the performance of physical layer algorithms is analyzed by bit or frame error rate results , which are obtained by monte carlo simulations . here",
    ", however , we define the event of @xmath80 users being successfully decoded as @xmath91 in a slot of degree @xmath77 .",
    "then , the capture probability can be numerically evaluated by extending the usual average frame error rate evaluation such that all user frames _ without frame error _ in the sense of @xmath91 are counted .",
    "evaluating @xmath92 monte carlo simulations , the capture probability can be approximated as : @xmath93 where @xmath94 counts how many times the event has happened ; this approximation enhances with increasing @xmath92 . according to",
    ", @xmath79 is required for all combinations of slot degrees @xmath95 and captures @xmath96 , where @xmath97 should be sufficiently high to evaluate all non - zero probabilities @xmath79 up to the achievable accuracy .    in order to numerically evaluate the capture probability for the and - or tree evaluation",
    ", we choose a specific physical layer setup . as mentioned in section  [ sec : sysmod ] , the capture probabilities are decided by the performance of the cs - mud scheme .",
    "thus , the choices of the length of pn sequence @xmath48 and average slot degree @xmath23 highly impact the numerical results . in cs theory",
    ", the properties of @xmath37 in strongly determine the recovery performance .",
    "the correlation of columns in @xmath37 is determined by pn sequences and user - specific channels and should be minimal to achieve the best performance . however , for the sake of resource efficiency the spreading factor @xmath48 should be chosen as small as possible , which requires a compromise .",
    "finally , due to the interaction of cs - mud and coded sa optimization in terms of average slot degrees the overall optimum choice of @xmath48 is unknown and beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "therefore , based on the general description given in section  [ sec : cs - mud ] , we focus on a basic setup to gain insight into the complex interaction of sa and cs - mud .",
    "we assume an overloaded cdma system with @xmath98 users and pn spreading sequences of length of @xmath99 and @xmath100 symbols per frame .",
    "furthermore , the transmit data will be encoded by a convolutional code with code rate @xmath101 and modulated to bpsk symbols .",
