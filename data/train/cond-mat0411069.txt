    "because of its relation to the mechanism for superconductivity in the high temperature superconducting compounds ( htsc ) , there has long been a raging debate regarding their orbital symmetry of the superconducting order parameter ( op).@xcite only `` phase - sensitive '' experiments involving josephson tunneling can distinguish the op from the non - superconducting pseudogap.@xcite although the first in - plane phase - sensitive experiment on yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 ( ybco ) suggested a dominant @xmath1-wave op,@xcite experiments using tricrystal films of ybco , bi@xmath3sr@xmath3cacu@xmath3o@xmath6 ( bi2212 ) , and nd@xmath7ce@xmath8cuo@xmath9 ( ncco ) , and tetracrystal films of ybco and la@xmath10ce@xmath11cuo@xmath12 ( lcco ) suggested that these materials had a dominant @xmath2-wave op.@xcite    very different results were obtained for @xmath13-axis junctions .",

    "the components of the quasiparticle wave vectors parallel to the junction on the two sides of the junction are completely independent variables .",
    "for example , let us consider a tight - binding model of near - neighbor hopping in a tetragonal lattice , as in eq .",
    "( 4 ) with @xmath58 . in this model , a quasiparticle far from the junction hops from one site to an adjacent site . in a defect - free straight ( or symmetric ) @xmath119 junction , the lattices on both sides of the junction are identical .",
    "thus , a quasiparticle can propagate from any site on one side of the junction to the nearest neighbor site on the other side without changing its direction .",
    "a quasiparticle can also backscatter coherently at the interface , preserving the component of the wave vector parallel to the junction , as in other treatments.@xcite for instance , when the interface is a ( 110 ) surface , the surface is theoretically atomically flat , allowing a substantial amount of coherent reflection , as sketched in fig .",
    "although with the usual vapor phase epitaxy , such @xmath120 junctions are far from perfect,@xcite when they were constructed using the far superior liquid phase epitaxy , an excellent fit to the fraunhofer pattern was obtained by application of a magnetic field parallel to the junction , without any evidence of a zero - bias conductance peak at the interface,@xcite at least in some cases .",

    "4 , the amount of coherent reflection off the surface is likely to depend strongly upon the incident quasiparticle wave vector direction , as the surface is a periodic , but uneven zigzag . to date",

    "3 , the ratio of the parallel lattice spacings on the two sides of the junction is @xmath124 , an irrational number .",
    "although specular reflection at the interface by a quasiparticle is entirely possible , in this case , even if the junction were atomically perfect , the proportion of atomic sites at which coherent tunneling across the junction can occur is vanishingly small .",
    "that is , in tunneling to the nearest site across the junction , nearly all quasiparticles will change the component of their direction parallel to the junction .",
    "one example of this is sketched in fig .",
    "3 . when one includes the dominant junction tunneling from all sites along the junction , the tunneling component of the quasiparticle wave vector parallel to the junction is effectively random .",
    "in general , one expects that atomically perfect straight junctions can exhibit specular , or coherent tunneling .",
    "defects would lead to a component of the tunneling that is random , or incoherent .",
    "asymmetric junctions and symmetric junctions that can not also be described as straight junctions ( such as the @xmath119 junction ) intrinsically lead to predominantly random , or incoherent tunneling .",
    "thus , atomically perfect @xmath125 asymmetric or @xmath126 symmetric junctions for @xmath127 ( with @xmath128 ) are expected to exhibit primarily random , or incoherent microscopic tunneling processes .",

    "for example , the ab microscopic model of josephson tunneling,@xcite which averages independently over the parallel components of the quasiparticle wave vector on each side of the junction , assumes uniformly random , or incoherent , microscopic quasiparticle tunneling only .",

    "however , for hole - doped cuprates , the agreement with the tricrystal experiments is less robust . assuming only a @xmath2-wave op,@xcite our fs2 results pictured in figs . 3 ,",
    "4 show that tricrystal ( a ) would have two @xmath27-junctions if the tunneling were specular , and one @xmath27-junction if it were random .",
    "tricrystal ( b ) should have no @xmath27-junctions , as claimed .",
    "tricrystal ( c ) , if the 2@xmath221 junction can be approximated by an asymmetric 0@xmath222 junction , would have one @xmath27-junction for specular tunneling , and two @xmath27-junctions for random tunneling .",
    "hence , our fs2 results are only consistent with the observation claims if the tunneling is non - specular .    on the other hand , the arpes fs , while only slightly different from fs2 , leads to very different conclusions with regard to the agreement with the tricrystal experiments .",
    "for specular gb tunneling , the arpes fs is in complete agreement with the observations of the three tricrystal experiments .",
    "however , for random gb tunneling , tricrystal ( a ) is expected to have a very small overall @xmath0 , as @xmath223 for all three asymmetric gb junctions in that tricrystal .",
    "although tricrystal ( b ) would be expected to exhibit an even number of @xmath27-junctions , as claimed to be observed , tricrystal ( c ) would be expected to exhibit one @xmath27-junction for random gb tunneling with the arpes fs .",
    "hence , the arpes fs can only be fully consistent with the tricrystal experiments on hole - doped cuprates for non - random gb tunneling .",
    "one interpretation is that if the quasiparticle tunneling across the relevant grain boundaries is random and the op were pure @xmath122-wave , then the fs would be expected to be more like fs2 . in the unlikely event that the grain boundary tunneling were coherent ,",
    "then a pure @xmath122-wave op would have a fs more like the arpes fs .",
    "such a scenario might be used to argue that the fs of bi2212 , usually thought to have the arpes fs form , is actually closer to fs2 .",
    "however , we caution that fs2 and the arpes fs are one - band approximations to the fs of bi2212 , which contains two cuo@xmath3 layers thought by many to be responsible for the superconductivity , and that no tricrystal ( c ) experiments were performed on bi2212 . in addition",
    ", this scenario ignores the @xmath13-axis twist experiments , which indicate that essentially all of the @xmath13-axis tunneling is in the @xmath1-wave channel.@xcite if those three experiments are correct , then bi2212 contains an op with an @xmath1-wave component that is at least 20% of the total . although not appreciated by tsuei _",
    "et al._,@xcite in the presence of nanoscale disorder that has recently been observed in stm experiments,@xcite a mixed @xmath224 op is indeed allowed.@xcite thus , it is possible that bi2212 could have a dominant @xmath122-wave op and still have all of the intrinsic @xmath13-axis tunneling be in the @xmath1-wave op channel .",
    "if this scenario proves to be true , then further calculations with a mixed @xmath1- and @xmath122-wave op would be warranted.@xcite    with regard to the most - studied material , ybco , in addition to the two cuo@xmath3 layers , there is also a conducting cuo chain layer , which is responsible for the orthorhombicity and the strong twinning that occurs in thin films .",
    "the strong twinning makes ( 100 ) and ( 010 ) films indistinguishable , which can complicate the analysis .",
    "second , unless strongly underdoped , ybco appears to be more three - dimensional than are most other cuprates , so that @xmath225 might be large enough to cause an important modification to our results .",
    "third , it is clear from many other experiments that ybco also has a substantial @xmath1-wave component,@xcite which has often been ignored by many workers.@xcite in each twin domain , a purported dominant @xmath122-wave op would have either a @xmath224 or a @xmath226 op mix , and if the twin areas were equal , then one might expect the @xmath1-wave op component to make a negligible contribution to the measured critical currents . however , in @xmath13-axis ybco / pb josephson junctions made with highly twinned ybco thin films , quantitative agreement to the fraunhofer pattern was obtained , although @xmath129 was considerably less than the ab value.@xcite    thus , the different results of fs2 and the arpes fs indicate that the tricrystal experiments are less robust determinations of the symmetry of the order parameter in hole - doped cuprates than has been generally thought .",
    "small variations in the fs topology and the non - specularity of the gb tunneling processes play a crucial role that can not be anticipated _ a priori_. to the extent that defects play a role in the tunneling processes , it might be possible to understand the experimental observations with a substantial @xmath1-wave op component .",
    "especially since the ( 001 ) tilt gb junctions are known to be increasingly underdoped with increasing gb misalignment,@xcite it is possible that @xmath27-junctions arising from the local magnetism of the cu@xmath227 spins formed from oxygen loss at the gb junctions could be important .",
    "all of our calculations using the shirai fs are in complete disagreement with both the tricrystal and tetracrystal experiments , regardless of the degree of randomness in the gb tunneling matrix elements .",
    "in addition , the shirai _",
    "results for specular symmetric 18.4@xmath219 gb s are in direct conflict with all experiments using tricrystal ( b).@xcite taking all of our results for the various fs s into account , it appears that there is a topological crossover relevant for the agreement of the critical currents with the gl results,@xcite with full agreement for the electron - doped fs s centered about the @xmath228 point in the first bz , and complete disagreement with the extreme shirai fs .",
    "the cross - over appears to occur for fs s intermediate to the arpes fs and fs2 .",
    "hence , for the hole - doped cuprates , not only are the details of the tunneling important , but the topological structure of the hole - doped fs is also very relevant , and minute details can change the interpretation .",
    "tetracrystals consisting of highly twinned thin films of the hole - doped ybco and electron - doped lcco containing a symmetric @xmath229 junction and a 45@xmath230 junction , plus two symmetric @xmath231 junctions were made.@xcite for comparison , they also made bicrystals with two symmetric 22.5@xmath232 junctions .",
    "we also calculated the straight gb junction case @xmath32 for a @xmath2-wave op , and our results for fs2 and fs3 are shown by the green dotted lines in figs .",
    "6 and 8 , and at 45@xmath164 , are opposite in sign to the respective symmetric junction cases with specular gb tunneling .",
    "if the tunneling were non - specular , as required for the @xmath122-wave interpretation with fs2 of the tricrystal experiments , then the 45@xmath230 junction would have the smallest ( or vanishing , for random tunneling ) @xmath0 value for a @xmath122-wave op .",
    "if instead the tunneling were specular , as required for the arpes fs @xmath122-wave interpretation of the tricrystal experiments on hole - doped cuprates , then that junction would allow a small but significant @xmath0 value , but would behave either as a @xmath27- or 0-junction , respectively , for a @xmath122-wave op , depending upon the particular distribution of twin domains present at the junction .",
    "thus , this tetracrystal would have an indeterminate number of @xmath27-junctions for specular tunneling and a @xmath122-wave op , but no supercurrent for random tunneling .",
    "similar arguments apply to the lcco case . for a highly twinned thin film junction , both specular and random tunneling across the 45@xmath230 gb junction would lead to @xmath223 for a @xmath2-wave op , contrary to the claims in the experiment.@xcite the other two junctions , symmetric 22.5@xmath232 junctions , would not be @xmath27-junctions , unless the tunneling were specular and the fs were different from any that we studied .",
    "hence , the interpretation put forward by those authors , which assumed the 45@xmath230 junctions were straight , should be reexamined,@xcite as the @xmath27-junction could arise extrinsically from defects in this very imperfect 45@xmath230 junction.@xcite we urge that the experiment be redesigned in the form of a tricrystal , omitting the 45@xmath230 junction .",
    "recently , there have been zigzag in - plane ybco / nb experiments.@xcite in these experiments , a ybco film is angularly cut from above with a ramping angle @xmath233 into a regular zigzag pattern of nominally exposed ( 100 ) and ( 010 ) edges , each edge of equal length @xmath234 m .",
    "after deposition of a thick layer of au , a thicker layer of nb was applied .",
    "this experiment is a variation of the earlier @xmath235 ybco / pb superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) experiment of mathai _ et al._,@xcite which contained ybco / pb junctions with a thin ag interstitial layer along the ramped nominally ( 100 ) and ( 010 ) edges of ybco , respectively . in those experiments ,",
    "one of the junctions functioned as a 0-junction , and the other functioned as a @xmath27-junction.@xcite the beauty of the recent experiment is that the zigzag array of alternating 0-/@xmath27-junctions was observed by a squid microscope to exhibit an ordered array of fractional vortices , the magnitude of which was within the experimental error of @xmath236 , where @xmath237 is the flux quantum .",
    "although no microscopic analysis of the edges of the ybco was presented , the ion milling technique employed necessarily leaves a rough surface on a scale of at least 1 - 5 nm , so that the tunneling across each of these edges is most likely incoherent .",
    "the thick au layer could modify the overall tunneling process , however .",
    "the much longer length scales @xmath238 of the josephson vortices , which is only 1 - 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the edge dimensions , allows the vortices to weakly interact , forming a regular array .",
    "these experiments are suggestive of a dominant @xmath122-wave op .    however , we recall that gim _",
    "studied ybco / pb squid s prepared with a much wider selection of squid angles @xmath163.@xcite in those experiments , which did not include @xmath235 , the results were inconsistent with either a predominant @xmath122- or @xmath1-wave op component,@xcite but were instead consistent with a @xmath239-wave polar state .",
    "apparently , the preparation of a @xmath180-junction or a @xmath27-junction depends upon the ramping angle @xmath240 of the bombarding ions , so that many pairs of squid s with angles @xmath163 and @xmath241 contained one 0-junction and one @xmath27-junction.@xcite although the nice zigzag experiments do demonstrate the reproducibility of the 0-junction and @xmath27-junction preparation at fixed @xmath240 and @xmath235 with ybco / nb junctions , those authors did not report the results of @xmath163 and @xmath240 variation studies.@xcite    we are presently engaged in calculating the single quasiparticle and pair excitations at low @xmath14 , both of which are contained in the green function matrix given by eqs .",
    "( [ gmnp ] ) and ( [ gmnm ] ) . for brevity",
    "we have here only presented the josephson critical current across the grain boundaries , the quasiparticle densities of states at the sites on the rows adjacent to or near to the junction can be evaluated from the imaginary part of the single particle @xmath242 for @xmath243 although the most commonly used procedure for obtaining the zero - bias conductance peak on a surface is to use the bogoliubov - degennes technique,@xcite our green function technique with the appropriate surface boundary conditions is equally valid,@xcite but is considerably more compact and powerful . with our green function technique , we are able to evaluate the critical current at arbitrary grain boundary angles , and are not restricted to specific interfaces such as @xmath244 for integral @xmath245 .",
    "it is also much easier to generalize the tunneling forms , although we have limited our treatment to the most commonly studied specular and random cases .",
    "although it would be rather easy to generalize the tunneling matrix elements to forms intermediate to these limiting cases for symmetric and straight junctions,@xcite for asymmetric junctions , such a generalization is more difficult . we have compared our results with those obtained by shirai _",
    "_ using a purely numerical technique , and some of their numerical results at low @xmath14 are in qualitative agreement with our results obtained from eq .",
    "( [ current ] ) .",
    "our results with the nearly circular fs3 are in fairly good agreement with those obtained with the gl model and with microscopic calculations using a circular fs.@xcite the main drawback with the green function technique is the procedure for making the calculations self - consistent .",
    "however , as noted by tanaka and kashiwaya,@xcite making the results self - consistent does not usually result in qualitative changes .",
    "we are presently engaged in self - consistent calculations for various grain boundaries of the @xmath244 types , as was done by shirai _",
    "et al._@xcite but we are using the near - neighbor and next - nearest neighbor single quasiparticle matrix elements appropriate for either the arpes or fs2 fs s on bi2212 , and will present our results elsewhere.@xcite we will also present the quasiparticle densities of states for these more realistic fs models elsewhere.@xcite    finally , we remark that recent ybco thin film structures have been studied using @xmath246 thin film boundaries with 45@xmath164 in - plane misalignment angles , and the results interpreted using the sigrist - rice formula .",
    "@xcite we have not yet analyzed such grain boundaries , because the fermi surface of ybco is particularly complicated , and our fs2 and arpes fs s are likely to be inadequate to do so reliably .",
    "nevertheless , from the results we obtained with these two fs s , it is evident that the results obtained from such devices , the grain boundaries of which have not been analyzed with atomic scale precision as was done with the bi2212 @xmath13-axis twist experiments,@xcite might also have a more conventional explanation.@xcite    it has been suggested that the experimental @xmath158 observed in @xmath247 tilt grain boundary junctions can only be understood in terms of interface defects , regardless of the op.@xcite of course , in bi2212 , it has long been established that a significant amount of static defects exist not only on the top cleaved surface,@xcite but throughout even the best single crystals.@xcite such defects combined with significant oxygen loss at the grain boundaries may be the most important source of the observed @xmath27-junctions in the tricrystal and tetracrystal experiments , accounting for the apparent inconsistency between those and the @xmath13-axis bicrystal and cross - whisker experiments.@xcite    finally , we recall that @xmath27-junctions are now routinely produced using junctions of the sns and sinis varieties constructed from conventional superconductors,@xcite so that a close reexamination of the tri- and tetracrystal experiments is warranted .",
    "this is especially true in the case of the hole - doped cuprates .",
    "we note that not only are @xmath27-junctions readily obtained with nb , al and their oxides,@xcite but the associated zero - bias conductance peaks and higher harmonic order josephson phase relations in such conventional junctions have also been observed,@xcite as in ybco.@xcite",
    "we calculated the critical current @xmath0 versus ( 001 ) in - plane tilt angle @xmath163 for symmetric and asymmetric grain boundary junctions , assuming the order parameter has either the @xmath1- , extended-@xmath1- , or @xmath2-wave form .",
    "we used two fermi surfaces appropriate for hole - doped cuprates , one appropriate for electron - doped cuprates , and an extreme fermi surface for comparison purposes , and took account of the surface boundary conditions appropriate for the interfaces .",
    "we studied both tunneling limits of specular and random tunneling .",
    "an important feature of our results is that the presence of the surface boundary conditions allows for a finite @xmath122-wave critical current across junctions in which the microscopic tunneling is random .",
    "this is especially important because the tunneling across nearly all in - plane ( 001 ) tilt junctions is expected to be random on an atomic scale , even within each reconstructed facet .",
    "although our results for electron - doped cuprates are in complete agreement with the interpretation of the observation of the tricrystal experiments on those compounds , our results for hole - doped cuprates differ qualitatively with those obtained from ginzburg - landau models,@xcite and indicate that the interpretation of the tricrystal experiments is complicated , depending upon strong assumptions about the details of the fermi surface topology and the nature of the tunneling processes .",
    "in addition , corresponding problems in the interpretation of the tetracrystal experiments on hole - doped cuprates persist , leading to expectations of an @xmath158 inconsistent with many experiments.@xcite we urge further in - plane @xmath247 tilt grain boundary experiments using films deposited by liquid phase epitaxy to be made , and for high resolution transmission electron microscopy studies of the pertinent grain boundaries to be presented.@xcite",

    "putting these numbers into the above dispersion , one obtains @xmath256 , which never vanishes , and hence does not exhibit a fermi surface .",
    "however , the @xmath257-independent part of this expression is inconsistent with their eq . ( 4 ) for the effective chemical potential , @xmath258 , where the summation is over the four near - neighbor in - plane sites denoted by @xmath259 and the two spin states .",

    "( 15 ) should be replaced with the number 4 to avoid overcounting the two spin states . with this modification , the correct dispersion of shirai _ et al .",
