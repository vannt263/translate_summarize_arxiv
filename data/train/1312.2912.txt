    "holding a fishing rod at one end ( @xmath0 ) and starting from the rod at rest , is it possible to achieve any desired displacement at the other ( @xmath1 ) by prescribing the motion of the held end ?",
    "this problem has a long history and is of practical relevance for the control of flexible robotic manipulators , a field of research that has attained a high degree of mathematical sophistication .",
    "the modest objective of this note , on the other hand , is to shed some light on the feasibility of solutions of the problem from the point of view of the elementary theory of partial differential equations .",
    "the analysis is conducted within the realm of small deflections of a timoshenko beam .",
    "two separate situations are envisioned . in the first , that we call the 2 - 2 problem , to achieve any desired displacement and rotation functions at the free end it is required to prescribe both the displacement and the rotation of the held end . since initially",
    "the rod is at rest , the motion at the free end will start with a delay dictated by the slower speed of wave propagation in the rod .",
    "the existence of a solution to this problem is argued on the basis of the existence of a solution to the cauchy problem when the roles of time and space are interchanged . the second situation , called the 1 - 1 problem , consists of attaining a desired displacement evolution at the free end while keeping the displacement of the held end fixed and prescribing only its rotation .",
    "the solution in this case is based upon the solution of a recursive functional equation .",
    "under fairly general assumptions , namely ,    1 .",
    "cross sections remain plane , though not necessarily perpendicular to the deformed axis of the beam , 2 .",
    "both translational and rotational inertia terms are included 3 .",
    "transverse deflections @xmath2 are very small compared with the length of the beam 4 .",
    "the material abides by hooke s law    timoshenko derived the dynamic equations of an ideal elastic beam , which bears his name . for the free motion ( no external forces ) of a beam of constant cross section and uniform material properties , timoshenko s equations can be expressed in terms of the transverse deflection @xmath2 and the cross - section rotation @xmath3 as @xmath4 and @xmath5 where @xmath6 are positive constants and where subscripts indicate partial derivatives with respect to the natural body - time coordinates @xmath7 .",
    "it is possible to eliminate @xmath3 between the two equations so as to obtain a single fourth - order pde for the transverse displacement .",
    "the result is @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "the constants @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 represent , respectively , relative measures of the shear compliance , rotational inertia and translational inertia . in the limiting case when the stiffness compliance and the rotational inertial approach zero values , we recover the classical bernoulli beam equation .",
    "an interesting intermediate case is that for which only the shear compliance vanishes .",
    "it is also possible to express the equations of motion as a symmetric system of four first - order pdes .",
    "the original formulation in terms of two second - order equations , however , is most suitable for the imposition of physically meaningful boundary conditions .",
    "the characteristic polynomial associated with this differential equation is @xmath13 the roots of this polynomial are @xmath14 and @xmath15 discarding the unlikely case in which @xmath16 , . ]",
    "equation ( [ beam1 ] ) is a totally hyperbolic pde , with @xmath17 as the four distinct characteristic speeds .",
    "physically , @xmath18 and @xmath19 correspond , respectively , to the forward and backward bending waves , while @xmath20 and @xmath21 pertain to the shear waves . notice that in the case of the bernoulli beam all roots @xmath22 of the characteristic polynomial vanish , which indicates an infinite speed of propagation of all signals . in the intermediate case of a bernoulli beam endowed with rotational inertia ( @xmath23 ) ,",
    "bending waves propagate at a finite speed .",
    "the bernoulli beam equation stands with respect to the timoshenko beam in a relation somewhat analogous to the relation between the heat equation and the wave equation .",
    "the fact that all characteristic roots vanish implies not merely the loss of hyperbolicity but also that , the characteristic line being purely spatial , the initial value problem specifies initial data on a characteristic line , just as in the case of the classical heat equation . although considerations of well - posedness can be derived for these non - hyperbolic characteristic - initial problems , the theory for totally hyperbolic problems is better established .",
    "for this reason , we will limit our considerations to the timoshenko beam and adduce physical arguments to claim that the results obtained for a flexible manipulator based on the timoshenko beam are also applicable to the bernoulli beam .",
    "let a @xmath24-th order totally hyperbolic linear pde for a function @xmath2 of the two independent variables @xmath25 and @xmath26 be given .",
    "consider a smooth line @xmath27 in the @xmath7 plane with the property of not being anywhere tangent to a characteristic direction .",
    "assume , moreover , that on this line we have stipulated sufficiently regular values of the function @xmath2 and of its derivatives up to and including the order @xmath28 in a direction transversal to @xmath27 . ) and ( [ beam0 ] ) the data to be stipulated are the two functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 and their first derivatives in a direction transversal to @xmath27 . ]",
    "the main result of the theory states that the solution at a point @xmath29 is completely and uniquely determined by the given data within the _ domain of dependence _ of @xmath29 obtained as the portion of @xmath27 comprised between the two extreme intersections with the characteristic lines through @xmath29 . for an equation with constant coefficients ,",

    "these conditions , however , can not be prescribed arbitrarily .",
    "it can be shown that the number of conditions to be imposed on any such line must be equal to the number of intersections with this line of the characteristic lines issuing from @xmath29 toward @xmath27 . in the case of the timoshenko beam",
    ", this implies that at each boundary exactly 2 boundary conditions must be specified .",

    "the 2 - 2 problem consists of finding two inputs ( such as @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) at the held end so that the desired outputs ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) are obtained at the free end while starting from vanishing initial conditions at all @xmath34 .",
    "the proof that the solution to this problem exists and the actual procedure to construct it are based on the fact that the line @xmath1 is non - characteristic .",
    "interchanging the roles of space and time , the problem effectively becomes an ` initial ' value ( cauchy ) problem .",

    "it is convenient to obtain a non - dimensional version of the equations of motion ( [ beam-1 ] ) and ( [ beam0 ] ) . defining the non - dimensional variables @xmath52 by @xmath53 we obtain @xmath54 and @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 is a measure of the slenderness ratio of the beam . in most applications",

    "interchanging the roles of space and time , we give as ` initial ' conditions on the line @xmath62 the following desired deflection @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the heaviside step function , a vanishing rotation ( for lack of a better choice ) , namely , @xmath65 and zero shear and bending moment as stipulated by conditions ( [ beam5 ] ) and ( [ beam6 ] ) .",
    "notice that we have chosen our desired deflection at the free end ( @xmath62 ) so that it starts to manifest itself , according to equation ( [ beam20 ] ) , at @xmath66 .    to run this problem in a commercial software , we stipulate artificial vanishing ` boundary ' conditions of displacement and rotation at ` time boundaries ' located far enough from the domain of interest ( at @xmath67 in our example ) . for the values @xmath68 , the solution was obtained with mathematica^^. the code",
    "is shown in figure [ fig : mathcode ] .",
    "notice that the non - dimensional wave speeds are @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively , for the shear and the bending waves .",
    "accordingly , the non - dimensional time for starting to impose the displacement and rotation on the held end ( @xmath71 ) , should be exactly equal to @xmath72 . and",
    "this is indeed the case in the numerical solution ( which does not make use of characteristics ) , as can be observed in the graphs .",
    "the solution converges for a very wide range of values of the slenderness parameter @xmath73 .",
    "on intuitive grounds it seems that , if the proverbial fishing rod is hinged to a support so as to permit only the variation of the angle at the held end , it should be possible to achieve any desired displacement at the free end provided one does not insist on imposing the rotation thereat .",
    "we call this the 1 - 1 problem .",
    "the intuitive reasoning is likely driven by a principle of conservation of the number of data necessary to solve a problem .",
    "it seems reasonable to conclude that all we are doing is exchanging the imposition of a desired rotation at the free end with a zero displacement at the other end .    in the 2 - 2 case ,",
    "the solution was attainable because we managed to convert this problem into a 0 + 4 formulation , namely , when all 4 data were available along a single non - characteristic line ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "this is the so - called cauchy problem , whose solution is guaranteed . to solve the 1 - 1 problem , on the other hand",
    ", we would have to resort to a 1 + 3 formulation .",
    "in other words , we would have to specify 3 data on the line @xmath62 ( namely , the desired displacement and the vanishing of the bending moment and the shear force ) and 1 on the line @xmath71 ( namely , the vanishing of the displacement ) .",
    "thus , it appears that , as we already pointed out in section [ sec : wellposedness ] , there will be a conflict between the initial conditions and the boundary conditions on either side of the rod . that this conflict may be resolvable",
    "should not come as a surprise , since we already encountered a similar conflict by imposing all 4 boundary conditions on a single end in the solution of the 2 - 2 problem .",
    "the key to the resolution resides in the fact that an arbitrary time delay is at our disposal .",
    "the details in the 1 - 1 case , however , are more subtle and perhaps less convincing .",
    "let a point @xmath29 be located on the line @xmath0 , as shown in figure [ fig : theoneoneproblem ] .",
    "if data are to be specified on the line @xmath1 , the domain of dependence thereat is dictated by the segment between the intersections , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , of this line with the two slower characteristics issuing form @xmath29 .",

    "moreover , we also specify the function @xmath84 under the condition that it vanishes identically for all times prior to some value @xmath85 , just as in the 2 - 2 problem .",
    "we have left the rotation @xmath86 unspecified .",

    "just presented , which will be illustrated in the next section by means of an example , should be strengthened . in particular , the issue of continuous dependence of the solution ( i.e. , the rotation ) on the boundary data ( i.e. , the displacement ) deserves special attention .",
    "to obtain an explicit solution of the general 1 - 1 problem we would need a corresponding explicit expression of the solution of the cauchy problem with ` initial ' data on the line @xmath88 .",
    "this expression not being available for general values of the parameters @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 in equation ( [ beam1 ] ) , we will solve the problem only for the case @xmath89 , namely , for the equation @xmath90 whose physical meaning is of less practical interest , but whose characteristic polynomial is identical to that of the general case .",
    "from the point of view of the original pair of equations ( [ beam-1 ] ) and ( [ beam0 ] ) , we have a weaker coupling resulting from neglecting the shear term in the second equation , that is , @xmath91 and @xmath92    the explicit solution of the cauchy problem for these equations under the ` initial ' conditions stipulated by equations ( [ beam5 ] , [ beam6 ] , [ beam7 ] , [ beam8 ] ) is given by @xmath93 and @xmath94 where we have shifted the origin to @xmath1 by introducing the variable @xmath95    we still need to determine the function @xmath96 .",
    "to achieve this aim , we set the deflection to zero at @xmath97 , giving us the desired recursive functional equation .",

    "the resulting function @xmath100 should clearly vanish , while the function @xmath101 provides the desired angle to be prescribed at the held end to produce the desired deflection at the free end .",
    "notice that the fact that , by definition , the desired displacement @xmath102 vanishes identically for all @xmath103 , guarantees the existence of a unique solution of equation ( [ beam37 ] ) , provided we impose the same condition on @xmath96 .",
    "similar considerations apply to the original timoshenko equations , except for the fact that the recursion formula is not available explicitly ."
