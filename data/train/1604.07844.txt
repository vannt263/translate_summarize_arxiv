    "what are the limits to technological achievement ? that question has always been implicit in discussions for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence ( seti ) . as far as we can tell",
    ", the universe as a whole is pristine and natural . if it s easy for technological societies to engineer whole sections of the cosmos , then the simplest explanation seems to be that we are alone .",
    "if such `` cosmic engineering '' is difficult or impossible , then there may be a menagerie of societies out there that are too subtle to detect yet .",
    "interstellar travel , which has not yet been achieved by humans , is one possible limit to technology .",
    "the apparent lack of starfarers in the local universe leads to fermi s paradox , which is the observation that the galaxy is old enough for even fairly slow starfarers , traveling at a few percent of @xmath1 , to spread across entirely ( @xcite and @xcite review possible solutions and implications ) .",
    "while some societies may decide against a large - scale expansion program , it seems unbelievable that any unified ban could be maintained across multitudes of completely alien societies and across billions of years @xcite .",
    "technological limits can be classified according to how much energy a society harvests . @xcite",
    "introduced a widely - used scale that roughly spans the imaginable possibilities .",
    "a type i society harnesses the power its planet receives from its sun . a type ii society catches all of the power radiated by its home sun .",
    "and a type iii society harvests all the energy radiated by all of the stars in its home galaxy ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "if technology is limited , then seti should search mainly for type i ( or smaller ) societies , which may be nearby .",
    "if , on the other hand , societies can and do achieve starfaring , then the fermi - hart argument suggests we should look for distant but easily observable type iii societies @xcite .",
    "most seti efforts so far have concentrated on small and nearby societies @xcite , but as galaxy surveys have become commonplace , there has been more discussion of how to look for type iii societies .",
    "surveys for type iii societies can follow at least two basic strategies .",
    "they can look for galaxies with strange morphologies , to see if aliens have physically rearranged or hidden stars ( @xcite ; @xcite describes how stars could be pushed around ) . or",
    ", they look for signs that the radiated starlight of the entire galaxy is collected .",
    "then the galaxy will look abnormally dark in the optical @xcite , but will emit waste power as thermal infrared @xcite .",
    "either the optical faintness or the thermal emission are signs .    in order to isolate excess thermal emission ,",
    "the temperature of the artificial structures must be assumed .",
    "this is especially important because the dust mixed into galaxies gas catches about half of the ultraviolet / optical starlight and thus also glows thermally , with typical temperatures of order 20 k in @xmath2 normal star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the typical assumption is that the thermal emission comes from billions of dyson spheres , each a shell of habitats surrounding a star at @xmath3au distances and kept at habitable temperatures .",
    "this maximizes the habitable volume around each individual star .",
    "then the excess thermal emission comes out in the mid - infrared ( mir ; @xcite ) . the most comprehensive survey yet for engineering of this kind , glimpsing heat from alien technology ( ) , searched for excess mir thermal emission from @xmath4 galaxies in the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) all - sky source catalog , and found no evidence for galaxies with their stellar populations surrounded by dyson spheres ( @xcite ; @xcite re - examined this sample ) .    this is not the only possible way to harvest all of the starlight from a galaxy , though .",
    "i will motivate the idea that type iii societies can plausibly take the form of _ blackboxes_. a blackbox is , simply , an entire galaxy ( or even cluster of galaxies ) shrouded within an opaque screen .",
    "the activities of the societies within it are thus completely unknown to us , and largely irrelevant as far as detecting them goes .",
    "a blackbox is fundamentally a galactic - scale entity , not just a collection of stellar type ii societies .",
    "since the emitting area covers the entire galaxy , and not just au - sized bubbles around individual stars , its effective temperature is no more than about a k ( kelvin ) over that of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "although a structure that big may seem far - fetched , especially since dyson spheres already defy the modern limits of engineering , i show that it could be possible with the use of artificial dust .",
    "a serendipitous survey for blackboxes already exists : the _ planck _ maps of the microwave sky .",
    "after all , _ planck _ is designed specifically to look for temperature fluctuations in the cmb , and a blackbox appears on the sky as a fairly large region of the sky that is slightly hotter than the cmb .",
    "sunyaev - zeldovich surveys also are good for detecting blackboxes for similar reasons .",
    "yet these experiments have found no blackboxes .",
    "as i will show , this means that _ there are essentially no blackboxes anywhere in the observable universe_. combined with other null results , it appears that type iii societies do not exist within the observable universe , not one in millions of galaxies .",
    "i am left to conclude , from the fermi - hart argument , that we are in fact alone in the observable universe , or we are doomed , and very plausibly both .",

    "while kardashev focuses on a structure with an earthly surface temperature of 300 k , he does mention that temperatures as low as 3 k are possible .",

    "but i will show that there is a problem with this concept that has not been discussed in the literature : it would take too much matter to surround a red giant with a shell of habitats .",
    "the solution  capturing light with dipole antennas  also makes building true galactic - size structures easy .",

    "but in mir light , it would basically look the same as it does now in near - infrared and optical ( ignoring interstellar dust ) .",
    "we would still see a disk and a bulge ; they d just appear to be made of big , cold stars .",
    "no convenient name has been given to these converted galaxies in the literature , as far as i am aware .",
    "in this paper , i will call them _ chilly ways _  the diffuse , white band of starlight that we know as the milky way is transformed into a diffuse band of mid - infrared light from chilly dyson spheres .",
    "dyson spheres were originally conceived as something living beings would build around their home stars , which are presumed to be similar to the sun .",
    "the spheres are rigid structures , or swarms of rigid structures , that they would physically live on ; they maintain a habitable temperature of a few hundred k , the same as the home planet of the builders @xcite .",
    "but not all stars have the same luminosity , and therein lies the problem with extrapolating one of these type ii societies to an entire galaxy .",
    "the surface area of a dyson sphere must scale directly with the luminosity of the star in order to maintain a habitable temperature .",
    "a 1 au wide dyson sphere around vega ( luminosity of @xmath58 ) , for example , would have a surface temperature of @xmath59 , comparable to venus surface temperature .",
    "the problem with chilly ways is that the majority of starlight in galaxies comes from bright blue stars or red giants .",
    ", @xmath385% from stars brighter than @xmath60 , 75% from stars brighter than @xmath61 , half from stars brighter than @xmath62 , and 15% from stars brighter than @xmath63 .",
    "according to the v - band luminosity function from @xcite , 90% of the v - band light of the galaxy comes from stars brighter than the sun , three quarters from stars @xmath64 times brighter than the sun , half from stars @xmath65 times brighter than the sun , one quarter from stars @xmath66 times brighter than the sun , and 16% from stars @xmath67 times brighter than the sun .",
    "rules out chilly ways that convert 85% of their starlight into mir light in their sample and allow 15% to escape , with weaker limits on partial chilly ways that capture half and one quarter of their starlight @xcite .",
    "] red giants , in particular , have typical luminosities that are several hundred times that of the sun .",
    "so , aspiring chilly way builders would need to build structures with several hundred times the mass of a solar dyson sphere . and the mass of a traditional solar dyson sphere is already something not to be undertaken lightly : @xmath68 the column density of the dyson sphere , @xmath69 , is presumed to be comparable to a building wall , since these are supposed to be habitats @xcite .    where could chilly way builders get the materials to build dyson spheres around brighter stars ? a habitable dyson sphere around a solar mass red giant would have a mass of up to a thousand jupiters  or about the entire mass of the host star itself . in principle",
    ", aliens could mine the material in stars with a starlifting process , in which light is reflected back onto a star , causing its outer layers to heat and escape @xcite .",
    "the early phases of a chilly way might then look like a galaxy filled with planetary nebulas , an interesting signature in its own right .    aside from the mass of the sphere , there s the problem of its composition .",
    "the majority of the mass in gas giant planets and host stars is in hydrogen and helium , but habitat structures would probably be mostly made of heavier elements .",
    "the chilly way builders would need to build fusion reactors , each big enough to be a small star in its own right and having a lifetime shorter than the universe s age , otherwise the dyson spheres could nt be built in time for us to see them . like rampant starlifting , these artificial stars",
    "might themselves be more spectacular signatures of cosmic engineering than the dyson spheres .",
    "a chilly way is a far more daunting engineering project than usually considered for these reasons .",
    "these problems all arise from the assumption that the dyson sphere is a collection of habitats .",
    "if the builders are simply out to collect all the energy of a star , the column density of a dyson sphere can be much lower , since the swarm elements may be more like efficient solid - state solar panels , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "depending on the details of the structures , they might be a lot thinner than @xmath70 , easily allowing much bigger dyson swarms to be built .",
    "but then , there s no reason to assume that the surface temperature of a dyson sphere is habitable .",
    "in fact , a colder sphere might be preferred for thermodynamic reasons ( c.f .",
    "since the solar panels might be a lot thinner than @xmath70 , there could easily be enough material to build a very large dyson sphere .",
    "we therefore have reason to consider looking for structures that are far more diffuse and far colder than the habitable dyson spheres of chilly ways .      once we go beyond the idea that type iii societies will simply maximize habitable surface area , then there are many more things that can be done with a galaxy .",
    "a galaxy is not empty space sprinkled with some stars .",
    "a type iii society may wish to engineer the interstellar medium ( ism ) between the stars .",
    "this would grant them the power to adjust the rate of star formation and to harvest the metals produced by dying stars .",
    "they may turn on and off the supermassive black hole at the center of their galaxy , to power more radical projects . or , they may wish to blast the gases out into intergalactic space .",
    "dust grains are one way to act on the ism .",
    "since dust grains contain heavy elements , they could be engineered to house microscopic computers , sensors , and broadcasting equipment .",
    "this kind of dust is called _",
    "smart dust_. smart dust is the ultimate endpoint of the current trend towards miniaturizing electronic devices ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it has been proposed that satellites and space probes can be replaced by swarms of spaceborne smart dust ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "but a type iii society may take this further ; rather than just sending a few discrete swarms to individual targets , they could fill an entire galaxy with smart dust . when the smart dust is numerous enough",
    ", the galaxy becomes opaque to its own thermal emission and it becomes a kind of blackbox .    while interstellar smart dust can not house biological beings , there are many things that it can do .",
    "the smart dust can be used to form a galactic - scale information network .",
    "a type iii society needs some way of communicating with itself across interstellar distances ; the interstellar smart dust could function in this capacity much like our own internet does for us .",
    "any artificial intelligences that the society may develop might dwell in the smart dust , since they are not limited by the cold temperatures of interstellar space .",
    "a blackbox , then , is a possible end point of the machine intelligence societies described in @xcite , even those that did not have cosmic engineering as a goal per se .",
    "in addition , non - intelligent computation and automation could be distributed among the vast number of smart dust grains , as a kind of literal cloud computing .",
    "furthermore , the dust can mechanically couple with the gases in the ism . if the dust grains can propel themselves , perhaps using radiative thrusters or by deflecting themselves on galactic magnetic fields , they can shape the ism .",
    "finally , dust grains are relatively efficient at capturing the starlight of a galaxy .",
    "i provide quantitative estimates of these capabilities in the appendix .",
    "once the opacity of the dust becomes high enough , it is possible to create a galactic - scale greenhouse effect using artificial dust .",
    "natural dust in starbursting regions can raise the temperature to @xmath71 on scales of a few hundred parsecs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in the most extreme natural star clusters , the temperatures might reach habitable levels @xcite .",
    "artificial dust , in principle , could have much higher opacities than natural dust . then",
    ", artificial dust could be used to establish literal galactic habitable zones extending over kiloparsecs . for comparison ,",
    "the total habitable volume of a chilly way with luminosity @xmath72 is @xmath73 . actually achieving this on 10 kpc scales requires an optical depth of order @xmath74 , which is probably too high to actually achieve . in addition",
    ", convection could set in and result in faster heat transport out of the blackbox .",
    "but smaller habitable zones are possible , as are large but colder zones that might be comfortable for something native to a world like titan ( as in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or the kuiper belt ( as in * ? ? ?",
    "the ultimate result could be to create an actual ecosystem where quasi - biological entities subsist off the ism and starlight .",
    "the dust grains themselves could be self - replicating , and there might be larger lifeforms that feed on them and reprocess them , analogous to ecological and geological cycles .",
    "different optical depths would have different `` climates '' , hosting different populations of beings .",
    "a truly _ galactic _ entity exploits the spaces and matter between the stars .",
    "the inhabitants of a chilly way are restricted to au - scale bubbles surrounding stars , leaving most of the galaxy s volume untouched .",
    "but by inhabiting the ism itself , as might be done with smart dust , the type iii society is truly pervasive ",
    "less a collection of individual worlds and more a _ genius loci _ that reaches everywhere in the galaxy .    _",
    "the case for blackboxes _  from a thermodynamic view , a chilly way is sub - optimal at harnessing the power of starlight .",
    "the maximum efficiency of a heat engine working between a hot heat reservoir with temperature @xmath75 and a cold heat reservoir with temperature @xmath76 is @xmath77 on a galactic scale and with conventional physics , the temperature of the cold reservoir is at least the temperature of the cmb , @xmath78 at redshift @xmath79 @xcite . in one sense",
    ", a dyson sphere can be very efficient , of course , since it harnesses optical light emitted by the surfaces of stars with temperatures of @xmath80 and thermalizes it to a temperature @xmath81 , releasing it as waste heat .",
    "but there s no reason why a second dyson swarm could nt surround the first , using the inner swarm as its hot reservoir and stepping it down to a colder temperature still ( perhaps @xmath82 ) .",
    "the `` waste heat '' of the inner swarm does not have to be waste at all , but can still be put to useful work .",
    "the second swarm can then be surrounded by a third swarm , and so on , until the outermost swarm has a temperature approaching that of the cmb .",
    "the idea of dyson swarms within swarms , called a matrioshka brain , was proposed as a way for maximizing the computation that a type ii society could perform @xcite .",
    "landauer s principle provides a fundamental reason why a society seeking to maximize computational power would tend to build a galaxy - wide blackbox instead of a chilly way . according to landauer s principle , each erasure of a bit requires the use of @xmath83 energy @xcite .",
    "colder temperatures allow for more energy - efficient computation . but put another way , landauer s principle states that each bit erasure produces one unit of entropy . aside from black hole formation ,",
    "the greatest source of entropy production in the present universe is the absorption and re - emission of starlight by dust in the ism @xcite . and",
    "indeed , this is because ism dust is both effective at capturing starlight and very cold , typically just around 20 k. a society that attempts to maximize entropy production  whether to convert more of the starlight into usable work , or to maximize computation ",
    "will probably use something like dust to harness the starlight , if they are using conventional physics at all . along these lines",
    ", @xcite proposed that type ii ",
    "iii societies would build structures in interstellar space far from their home galaxy s core to take advantage of the frigid conditions , and even suggested they might use something like smart dust , although they did nt quite extend the idea to capturing all of a galaxy s light .      _ the uses of antennas _  but is it really possible to render a galaxy totally opaque to its own thermal radiation , on kiloparsec scales ?",
    "the typical milky way - like spiral galaxy absorbs about half of its ultraviolet radiation @xcite , but dust grains are much less effective at absorbing light at longer wavelengths .",
    "the most intense starburst regions of star - forming galaxies do appear to be opaque to their own thermal radiation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "yet these regions are generally only about a few hundred parsecs across .",
    "the large optical depths arise from the large column densities of gas ; hiding an entire milky way - sized galaxy requires either too much gas , or too high a metal abundance . even at high redshift , where actively star - forming galaxies can contain large amounts of gas , the biggest starbursts are about a kiloparsec across ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "natural blackboxes are therefore unlikely to be more than a kiloparsec across , too small to hide a fully engineered galaxy .",
    "the problem with natural dust is that it is three - dimensional .",
    "a lot of the mass is hidden inside the center of a dust grain , where it does not absorb infrared light .",
    "small dust grains are very poor at coupling with far infrared light , but large grains about one wavelength across require disproportionately more mass because of the cube law .",
    "wire antennas have a far more effective geometry for absorbing and emitting long wavelength light .",
    "the simplest antenna geometry is the dipole antenna floating in free space .",
    "it is a straight wire of length @xmath84 , typically cut into two segments that are wired into a feed point that is connected to whatever devices are powered by the antenna .",
    "the system can be modeled as an rlc circuit .",
    "the antenna itself has an associated impedance @xmath85 at each frequency @xmath86 ; the real part is called the radiation resistance ( @xmath87 ) , and the imaginary part is the reactance @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "a half - wavelength dipole is a special case that interacts well with light of wavelength @xmath89 . at this frequency ,",
    "the antenna reactance is zero , and light can effectively be absorbed or scattered by the dipole .",
    "for this reason , this frequency is said to be the resonant frequency of the antenna .",
    "when the antenna has no thickness , the resonance is exactly at @xmath90 , at which @xmath91 .",
    "the resonance occurs at slightly greater wavelengths for thick antennas @xcite .",
    "away from resonance , the reactance diverges from 0 at a rate @xmath92 that depends on the thickness of the antenna .",
    "thick antennas have a relatively small @xmath93 and therefore have a big bandwidth , while thin antennas are narrowband instead .",
    "however , the bandwidth depends only weakly on the length - to - width ratio of the dipole once the ratio is @xmath94 @xcite , so a collection of narrow antennas may be more effective than a thick antenna in terms of spectrum coverage per material used .",
    "there are also ways to emulate a thick antenna with relatively little material , by using a hollow wire or connecting a few parallel thin wires , for example ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we are interested in how much power the antenna can deliver into the rest of the circuit , even if it is not in resonance . for simple circuits ,",
    "the rest of the circuit can be characterized by an impedance of @xmath95 which can be regarded as in series with @xmath96 for dipole antennas near resonance ( @xcite discusses some of the caveats for circuit models of antennas ) .",
    "@xmath95 includes the effects of both dissipative ohmic losses in the antenna and the circuitry attached to the feed point .",
    "then the efficiency of power delivery to the rest of the circuit , @xmath97 follows from a calculation of the reflection constant @xmath98 the efficiency reaches 1 when the impedances are matched ( @xmath99 ; @xcite ) .",
    "note that the fraction of power delivered to a circuit element attached to the feed point is less than @xmath100 because of ohmic losses in the antenna conductor ; another reflection constant must be considered to calculate this fraction @xcite .",
    "however , i am mainly interested in calculating whether the antenna is an effective absorber , so i include ohmic losses because they convert the incident light into heat .    as an example",
    ", consider what would happen if the rest of the circuit had a purely resistive nature , with a purely real @xmath95 equal to @xmath101 : @xmath102 at resonance ( @xmath103 ) , @xmath100 starts off small for low resistance systems ( @xmath104 ) , peaks at 1 when @xmath105 , and then falls off for high resistance systems ( @xmath106 ) ( c.f .",
    "according to equation  [ eqn : etalresistiveload ] , the reactance only matters when @xmath107 .",
    "antennas attached to a highly resistive circuit ( @xmath108 ) are actually wideband , in that they maintain a constant @xmath109 over a broad span of frequencies .",
    "this suggests one strategy at implementing an economical blackbox : very thin wires have high ohmic resistance , but they use very little mass so that a lot of them can be built , each effective at absorbing light of a variety of frequencies ( c.f .",
    "the great advantage of using antennas is clear when considering their effective aperture , which is their absorption cross section .",
    "when averaged over all angles and all polarizations , as appropriate for an antenna floating in a thermal radiation background , it is @xcite @xmath110 the @xmath111 factor accounts for the fact that a dipole antenna has a single polarization , and radiation interacts with it only if its polarization is the same .",
    "a dipole antenna can easily be as effective at absorbing light as a standard three dimensional dust grain , using just a thousandth of the mass .",
    "this makes them well - suited for building blackboxes , where the limiting factor is the amount of materials available ( equation  [ eqn : dysonmass ] ) .",
    "antennas can also scatter or reflect light .",

    "the scattering opacity is largest when dissipative losses in the antenna ( represented by @xmath101 ) are small .",
    "when the load and radiation impedances are matched in the antenna circuit , @xmath114 , and in resistive antennas , @xmath115 drops quickly as @xmath101 increases and reflection is negligible @xcite .",

    "note that this is actually wavelength independent .",
    "this allows for relatively low mass blackboxes that trap long - wavelength thermal infrared and even radio emission .",
    "the minimum mass can also be written as a minimum column density , independent of the surface area of the blackbox : @xmath147    second , since the dipoles are made of atoms , the antennas must be at least a few atoms across .",

    "it is probably more advantageous to extract energy from the waste heat by building another layer around the blackbox and harnessing the temperature difference between the new , colder surface and the interior . yet , harvesting non - thermal radiation may be easier since it does not require working with small temperature differences . or",
    ", the occupants of a blackbox may try to stop non - thermal radiation simply to hide their activities or some other reason .",
    "radio emission can be absorbed quite efficiently with dipole antennas , similar to those that might be used to absorb the thermal radiation of a blackbox .",
    "i showed in section  [ sec : dipoleclouds ] that the mass of an opaque dipole cloud does not depend on the wavelength at low frequencies  the effective area of the antenna increases as the square of its length , while the cross - section must also increase as the square of its length to avoid ohmic losses .",

    "still , doubling the total mass of a dipole cloud should still be allowed in the mass budget of a galaxy if carbon nanotube antennas are used . for mhz radio waves ,",
    "half - wavelength dipole antennas need to be kilometers long .",
    "yet antennas that are hundreds of meters tall are used on the earth for transmitting radio .",
    "furthermore , interstellar space is a much gentler environment than the earth , with negligible gravity , pressure , and temperature ; building big antennas and setting them free in the ism may work fine .",
    "there is no obvious clever solution like dipole antennas for absorbing harder x - rays and gamma rays .",
    "the optical properties of a material depend on structures that are smaller than the wavelength of a photon ; when the wavelength of a photon is smaller than an atom , only chemistry and nuclear physics matters .",

    "the excess power conjured against the first law of thermodynamics can not be vastly greater than the typical luminosity of a galaxy , or else it would have been seen with wise .",
    "similar considerations apply for blackboxes ; they would have been detected by _ planck _ and earlier surveys .",

    "what if aliens know a way around the second law of thermodynamics , unlikely as that is ? in the worst case from an observer s point of view ( but not the aliens ) , energy is continuously recycled and never released as waste heat . as far as searches in the microwave and infrared regions are concerned , it might as well be as if the aliens are not there .",
    "but there is another possibility ",
    "the blackbox ( or chilly way ) can be refrigerated until it is much _ colder _ than the cmb .",

    "a refrigerated blackbox is possible if it is opaque to low energy neutrinos or gravitational waves .",
    "the temperature of the cosmic neutrino background from the big bang is expected to be only 1.95 k @xcite .",
    "a blackbox could potentially use the cmb as a hot reservoir and the neutrino background as a cold reservoir and extract useful work . just as the ebl heats a blackbox slightly over the cmb",
    ", the diffuse supernova neutrino background may heat a neutrino - opaque blackbox . the energy density in the supernova neutrino background",
    "is probably comparable to that of the ebl @xcite , so this heating is at most a few hundredths of a kelvin , compared to a potential cooling of a few tenths of a kelvin . the relic gravitational wave background , if there is one , is thought to be even colder , at less than 1 k @xcite , providing another possible cold reservoir . of course , a galaxy - sized shroud that can absorb neutrinos and especially gravitational waves defies our knowledge of material physics",
    ".    a very large black hole would also appear colder than the cmb , if it was large enough to cast a detectable shadow , and would still be allowed by thermodynamics .",
    "rich galaxy clusters contain about @xmath336 of matter .",
    "if it was all fed into a single black hole , the hole would grow to have a schwarzschild radius of about 100 pc .",

    "thus , these galaxy clusters appear hotter at high frequencies @xcite .",
    "a refrigerated blackbox appears as a negative source at all frequencies .",
    "the cmb does not have exactly the same temperature in every direction , but is slightly cooler in a few parts of the sky than others .",
    "a refrigerated blackbox appears like an extreme temperature anomaly , with a magnitude of order a k instead of a few dozen @xmath338 . clearly , if any such blackboxes existed and were resolved in the sky by _ planck _",
    ", it would have been noticed by now in searches for non - gaussian anomalies . even if it was just the size of the milky way , and unresolved , the negative flux from the blackbox would be of order @xmath339 , easily noticed by _ planck _ and sunyaev - zeldovich surveys ( equation  [ eqn : fiducialexcessflux ] ) .",
    "thus , there are probably no large , refrigerated blackboxes .",
    "the thermal emission of a blackbox comes out in radio , microwave , and infrared bands .",
    "infrared surveys can be useful for hot blackboxes , just like they are for dyson spheres @xcite , but they are essentially useless for cold blackboxes with @xmath340 .",
    "all ( conventional ) blackboxes should emit microwave thermal emission , since they are at least as hot as the cmb , but all - sky microwave surveys tend to be relatively shallow .",
    "finally , although blackboxes are much fainter at ghz radio frequencies , a radio survey might pick up their emission anyway , much like how radio telescopes can study the extended photospheres of giant stars @xcite . fortunately",
    ", there are now many all - sky and large field surveys for all three , which i list in table  [ table : figuresofmerit ] . but which of these is most constraining ?    this depends on whether one knows where to look .",
    "a survey reaches some minimum flux @xmath341 and covers some solid angle on the sky @xmath342 .",
    "there are three possibilities to consider .",
    "first , what if one wanted to catalog all the blackboxes in some well - defined region of space , like a given galaxy cluster ?",
    "then , it does not matter if the survey is wide - field or not , as long as it covers the target region .",
    "the effectiveness of the survey depends only on the ratio of the expected flux to the minimum flux , which can be parameterized by @xmath343 a blackbox that covers a solid angle @xmath293 on the sky is detectable if @xmath344 .",
    "what if one wanted to construct a luminosity - selected catalog of blackboxes , or to measure the fraction of galaxies sealed in blackboxes in the local universe ?",
    "blackboxes with the necessary luminosity are visible out to some comoving distance @xmath345 .",
    "the survey effectiveness is measured by how much comoving volume it examines : @xmath346 , where @xmath342 is the solid angle covered by the survey . if the blackboxes are relatively faint , then @xmath347 is small compared to cosmological scales and has the form @xmath348 , where @xmath349 is a reference radius of a blackbox .",
    "the sampled comoving volume is then proportional to @xmath350    on the other hand , if the blackboxes are very bright , they can be visible anywhere in the universe .",
    "this is actually true for blackboxes that contain rich galaxy clusters .",

    "star - forming galaxies contain dust with temperatures around 20 k @xcite .",
    "distinguishing between this natural dust and artificial dust is a challenge when searching for chilly ways of these temperatures .",
    "the apparent gas - to - dust ratio can be used as a signature of artificial activity .",
    "dipole antennas can have a far greater opacity than the same mass of natural , three - dimensional dust , so a galaxy filled with them will appear to have an anomalously high dust mass , perhaps exceeding the gas mass itself .",
    "there is also a window above 600 k that has not been explored in seti .",
    "although organic beings can not survive in places that hot , technology might .",
    "chilly ways with @xmath501 could be built with dyson spheres fairly close to the surfaces of stars , or a larger cloud around a bright active nucleus .",
    "they could be detected with wise , which was designed to find similarly hot brown dwarfs .",

    "another possibility not yet examined is that of partial blackboxes with @xmath503 .",
    "my calculations in section  [ sec : dipoleclouds ] indicate that the milky way has just enough metals in its ism to reach @xmath504 with metallic wire dipole antennas , and much more if carbon nanotube antennas can be used .",

    "further improvements can be set mainly by a more careful examination of the _ planck _ catalogs and more sensitive microwave surveys . beyond a certain point , though , emission from artificial dust is buried by that of natural dust , both the rayleigh - jeans tail of small grains and the blackbody emission of very large grains equilibrating to the same temperature as any artificial dust .",
    "the thermodynamic motivations for blackboxes ignore one very important possibility .",
    "astronomical black holes are far , far colder than the cmb , and so are ideal cold reservoirs .",
    "vastly more entropy is generated by sending energy into a black hole than by running it through a blackbox .",

    "so why bother with blackboxes at all ?",
    "blackboxes are much easier to construct ; the basic technology involves relatively simple physics .",
    "in contrast , it is not clear how feasible megastructures girdling supermassive black holes are . while in principle",
    "more entropy is produced by sending energy into a black hole than out through a blackbox , it is not clear how to actually use that entropy increase for computation .",
    "after all , most matter falling into black holes actually becomes very hot .",
    "shifting this power down to low temperatures would require a large emitting area  in other words , a blackbox .",
    "the entropy is ultimately released in the hawking radiation , and could be used for computation then , but this could take more than a googol years , and it is not even clear baryonic matter will still be around then @xcite .",
    "in addition , typical supermassive black holes can not actually sustain type iii , or even type ii societies , as defined by their power consumption .",
    "the total amount of power that can be harvested from the cmb by sending it into a black hole is limited : @xmath508 with @xmath509 as the schwarzschild radius of a black hole of mass @xmath510 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "trying to harvest more power requires either hotter material surrounding the black hole or non - thermal emission that would produce enormous waste heat , and is self - defeating .",
    "the thermodynamic advantages of black holes require the aliens to be very patient .",
    "finally , black holes are ultimately fueled by the matter around them , which comes from the galaxy at large and ultimately the intergalactic medium .",
    "although type iii societies may decide on black holes as their ultimate home , they still have to move gas and possibly stars into the centers of their galaxies . in order to funnel the ism of their home galaxies inwards",
    ", they could very well build a blackbox as an intermediate step , using its artificial dust to interface with the gas .",
    "if we are alone in the observable universe , then one might conclude that the `` great filter '' is safely behind us , and that humanity s future beyond current crises is bright .",
    "it is not . even if @xmath498 is much greater than @xmath511",
    ", it can still be much less than 1 .",
    "in fact , the very same dipole cloud technology may also spell our doom . for consider , what would happen if we placed a blackbox around the earth itself ?",
    "the outcome would depend on @xmath124 and which wavelengths it absorbed .",
    "a @xmath179 planetary blackbox that absorbed optical light would reduce solar insolation to about 30% of its current value . as a result ,",
    "the surface temperature of the planet would drop to @xmath512 of its current value , a fall of roughly 60 k. the surface of the planet would freeze within a few months , and the oceans would freeze in about a millennium , as the world artificially transitioned into a snowball earth phase . in the end , most life would go extinct , except that living deep underground or near oceanic vents .",
    "alternatively , a @xmath179 planetary blackbox that absorbed mid - infrared light would cause an enormous greenhouse effect .",
    "the earth s greenhouse gases , particularly water vapor , already push the surface temperature up about 30 k @xcite . since the temperature only increases as @xmath513 , the effects of the next optical depth are thus reduced somewhat .",
    "still , a mid - infrared planetary blackbox could raise the earth s surface temperature by another few tens of k. by itself , this would make the surface inhospitable to complex life .",

    "wavelength radiation , the skin depth is @xmath558 a good quality iron conductor with @xmath559 has a skin depth of about 100 nm at these frequencies .",
    "the skin effect must be taken into account when designing the dipole cross - section if the radius of a filled disk with a given area is smaller than the skin depth : @xmath560 the @xmath561 factor accounts for the fact that a fraction of the current still flows below one skin - depth . in section  [ sec : dipoleclouds ] , i assumed that the cross - sectional area was at least @xmath562 .",
    "then , the skin effect matters if @xmath563 , or @xmath564 regardless of the conductor s resistivity or the resonant frequency , the skin effect can be basically ignored for a half - wave dipole with @xmath565 if the conductor is non - ferromagnetic . however , it clearly can not be ignored for a ferromagnetic material like iron .",

    "high frequency dipoles often are manufactured with ring cross - sections , effectively only including the current - bearing skin of the antenna @xcite .",
    "a ring cross - section may also be used to create a relatively wide dipole , which has a larger bandwidth near resonance @xcite .",
    "even wider antennas can be effectively achieved because the conducting ring itself does not have to be solid , but can consist of disconnected elements .",
    "for example , a few conducting rods can be arranged in a sparse ring ; when wired together correctly , they form a cage dipole antenna @xcite . with a little engineering , the skin effect does not prevent the efficient use of ferromagnetic conductors like iron in a blackbox .",
    "like most conceptions of dyson spheres , a dipole cloud involves an astronomical number of swarm elements swarming in a limited space . and like dyson spheres @xcite , actually maintaining a blackbox runs into a problem of traffic control ",
    "how does one keep all of those elements from crashing into one another ?    simply allowing the motes to crash into one another wo nt work , not if the elements are half - wavelength dipoles .",
    "when two thin dipoles collide , they almost always cross one another like an x shape . if the radius of each dipole is @xmath156 , the contact area where the dipoles touch is of order @xmath566 . assuming the relative velocity of the elements is @xmath567 , the collision lasts for a duration of @xmath568 .",
    "a significant fraction @xmath569 of the momentum of each dipole ( @xmath570 ) is transferred to the other during this collision .",
    "this setup leads to a stress on the contact area of @xmath571 : @xmath572 for comparison , most materials fail under stresses greater than a few hundred mpa .",
    "the characteristic collision timescale for a blackbox is in fact the orbital time of an element , because if a blackbox has an optical depth of @xmath573 , any path through the host galaxy typically passes through @xmath573 element .",
    "although dipole antennas have needle - like shapes , with geometrical cross - sections much smaller than their radio cross - sections , two elements are likely to meet at an angle with one another when they collide , so their effective cross sections are still of order @xmath574 .    in more detail , the average time a mote of length @xmath84 goes between collisions is @xmath575^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath576 is the volume of the region filled by motes , @xmath577 is the mote length distribution function , and @xmath578 is the typical collision cross section for two motes of length @xmath84 and @xmath579 averaged over all possible orientations .",

    "it is clear that the collision problem is far more severe for planetary - scale blackboxes ( @xmath587 ) and dyson swarms ( @xmath588 ) than for a galaxy - scale blackbox ( @xmath589 ) , if the motes are released into random orbits .",
    "nonetheless , the collision time is still very short compared to the millions or billions of years that a type iii society may last .",
    "there are a few obvious solutions .",
    "the first is giving the dipoles some kind of navigation system to steer around each other .",
    "getting one mote to detect another and exchange navigational information with it in time to avoid collision could have practical difficulties that i discuss later .",
    "a second solution is to give the antennas some kind of self - repair capability .",
    "a third is to launch the motes in organized patterns with cold velocity dispersions , so that the relative velocities of nearby motes is very small compared to their total orbital velocities .",
    "for example , a velocity dispersion of @xmath590 , more typical of the galactic interstellar medium , prolongs the mote survival time to @xmath591 . as @xcite notes , gravitational instabilities may arise that disrupt these patterns , and",
    "the stellar population of a galaxy will stir the population of motes and heating their relative velocities .",
    "the lifetime of the blackbox is important when setting limits on the abundance of blackbox builders ( equation  [ eqn : type3drake ] ) .",
    "even if the motes start with zero relative velocity to each other , once any guidance is turned off , they will be dragged by the turbulent gas flow of the ism .",
    "generally , turbulence is stirred up on an outer scale , and the energy cascades down to smaller scales in one flow crossing time on the outer scale .",
    "supersonic turbulence would probably dissipate the blackbox very quickly for three reasons : ( 1 ) it is characterized by shocks , with velocity discontinuities on small scales , resulting in relatively large velocities between the motes ; ( 2 ) it concentrates most of the mass into transient , small clumps , where the higher mote density will result in much faster destruction ; and ( 3 ) even if the motes survive in the clumps , the clumpiness of the ism will leave most of the galaxy unobscured ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this is the situation for turbulence in cold and warm gas in galaxies @xcite .",
    "so the maximum unguided blackbox lifetime is probably of order @xmath592 for an outer scale of @xmath593 and a velocity dispersion of @xmath590 .",
    "subsonic turbulence is not as clumpy , and it is characterized by a kolmogorov spectrum , with small velocity dispersions on small length scales .",
    "this is the case for the icm of galaxy clusters .",
    "the flow crossing time may not limit the blackbox lifetime , but for completeness , it is of order @xmath594 for an outer scale of @xmath595 and a velocity dispersion of @xmath596 @xcite .",
    "the collisional destruction of the motes does not proceed at the same rate for all of them .",
    "large motes are destroyed first .",
    "if the motes break into only a few pieces when they shatter , then the debris from large motes should not accelerate the destruction of the small motes much .",
    "for metallic dipoles at very cold ism temperatures , the dipole wire radius is set by nanoscale effects on the drude conductivity , so that the mass goes as @xmath597 .",
    "then , since @xmath598 , the small motes outnumber the fragments of large motes , as long as the size of the debris is bigger than @xmath599 . for carbon nanotube antennas ,",

    "when i motivated blackboxes as a form that type iii might take in section  [ sec : geniusloci ] , i implied that individual smart dust elements could harness the ambient radiation to do useful work on the ism .",
    "i also suggested that a type iii society might build a blackbox with an enormous optical depth , to create a greenhouse environment with relatively high temperatures .",
    "but while a marginally opaque blackbox can harness the huge temperature difference between starlight and the cmb , the temperature gradients deep in an opaque atmosphere are small . unless there s something very wrong with our knowledge of physics ( section  [ sec:2lot ] ) ,",
    "only a small fraction of the ambient radiation energy density can be harnessed .",
    "furthermore , the temperature of a cold blackbox asymptotes to @xmath326 ; the energy density of reprocessed energy may be just a tiny fraction of the total energy density .",
    "does the second law of thermodynamics render blackboxes useless at high optical depths ?",
    "as it turns out , no .",
    "when there is only a small temperature difference @xmath602 to exploit in an environment with an ambient temperature @xmath603 , the maximum carnot efficiency of a heat engine is @xmath604 at any given place deep in a blackbox atmosphere , an element receives radiation from cooler material that is up to @xmath573 optical depth above it and hotter material that is up to @xmath573 optical depth below it .",
    "this provides the temperature difference that can be used for work .",

    "of course , an actual blackbox is embedded in the cmb and the ebl .",

    "if the mean free path of photons @xmath619 is much smaller than @xmath606 and @xmath620 , as assumed when deriving the grey atmosphere solution , then @xmath621 .",
    "the carnot efficiency of the element is then @xmath622^{-1 } \\times d\\tau^{\\prime},\\ ] ] where @xmath623 .",
    "but while the thermodynamic efficiency is indeed small , the flux of useful energy through the atmosphere is @xmath624 deep in the atmosphere , the ambient energy density is greater by a factor @xmath605 than at the surface , canceling out the smaller thermodynamic efficiency . likewise ,",
    "if there is a lot of background radiation , a mote can not harvest that background , but it can still harvest a much smaller flux from the blackbox s own luminosity .",
    "the use of the grey atmosphere solution assumes that the flux through the atmosphere is constant , not converted into a non - thermal form nor escaping the blackbox directly .",
    "this is true if the work performed is ultimately dissipated as waste heat within the blackbox . if a layer of the blackbox converted all of @xmath625 into neutrinos that simply escaped , for example , shallower layers above it have no useful flux to do more work .",
    "the upshot is that a type iii society can , in principle , always extract more work from its starlight by shrouding a blackbox in another layer of material , as long as all the work is converted back into waste heat .",
    "the total amount of work extracted is proportional to the number of motes and the total optical depth @xmath626 , since all of the motes within the atmosphere are exposed to the same amount of useful flux .",
    "this is in accord with the reasoning behind the matrioshka brain ( section  [ sec : geniusloci ] ) .",
    "it works even if the excess temperature is much smaller than @xmath326 .",
    "a mote with a single dipole antenna only harnesses a fraction of @xmath625 because ( 1 ) it catches light of a single polarization , ( 2 ) the antenna is not perfectly efficient , and ( 3 ) it may have a narrow bandwidth .",
    "the total amount of power derived can be written in terms of an effective aperture @xmath627 : @xmath628 @xmath627 depends on the spectral response of the mote , the effectiveness it converts thermodynamically useful power into work , and the total background of thermal radiation available : @xmath629 the @xmath630 factor is the antenna s efficiency at converting the thermodynamically useful flux in light with wavelength @xmath631 into work .",
    "note that @xmath630 is the efficiency at converting the total flux of light divided by @xmath632 , so it s possible for @xmath630 to equal 1 .    throughout most of this paper ,",

    ", the aperture attains a value of @xmath638 not all motes will be resonant at the optimal wavelength in a blackbox , so i find it convenient to define a scaling variable @xmath639 that accounts for the smaller aperture .",
    "thus , for all narrowband antennas , @xmath640    for convenience , i will give values for two broadband cases here .",
    "if an antenna has a constant @xmath641 for a broad frequency range around @xmath642 , then because the effective aperture of an antenna scales as @xmath643 , it is more effective at absorbing the rayleigh - jeans tail of the thermal radiation .",

    "thus , @xmath651 .",
    "these antennas have an aperture of @xmath652 and can harvest @xmath653 of power .",
    "like our own internet , a blackbox may take the form of many computers that are connected to one another .",
    "let s compare the power of the individual computers that make up these networks , as well as the rate that information is exchanged between them .    according to landauer s principle , irreversible computation is directly related to entropy .",

    ", there does not have to be a direct connection between any two given elements ; rather , information can be passed along from one mote to the next until it reaches the destination .",
    "but information transfer between two relatively nearby motes faces some big challenges .",
    "the typical distance between a mote with resonant wavelength @xmath122 and its nearest neighbor with an overlapping resonance is @xmath659^{-1/3 } = \\left(\\frac{f_{\\rm pol } \\etaabs \\lambda_a^2 v_{\\rm box}}{4 \\pi \\tau_{\\rm abs } a_{\\rm box}}\\right)^{1/3 } = 16\\ \\km \\left(\\frac{2 f_{\\rm pol } \\etaabs}{\\tau_{\\rm abs}}\\right)^{1/3 } \\left(\\frac{r_{\\rm box}}{10\\ \\kpc}\\right)^{1/3 } \\left(\\frac{\\lambda_a}{\\mm}\\right)^{2/3}\\ ] ] in a spherical blackbox .",

    "this distance is much bigger than the motes themselves , and unless the transmission is highly beamed , most of the energy is wasted .",
    "let s calculate the power transfer between two elements .",
    "suppose the transmitting element broadcasts a signal with a power spectrum of @xmath662 over a frequency range @xmath309 to @xmath310 .",
    "the duty cycle of the sender s transmissions is @xmath663 , so the time - averaged power spectrum is @xmath664 .",
    "furthermore , the transmitter beams the signal into a solid angle @xmath665 that includes the receiving .",
    "the receiving mote , located a distance @xmath666 from the sending element , has an effective aperture of @xmath667 , a solid angle field of view @xmath668 , and can deliver the signal power at frequency @xmath86 to the detector with an efficiency @xmath669 .",
    "the transmitting mote must be in the receiving mote s field of view , and the receiving mote has to be listening while the signal is being sent .",
    "the detected power at the receiver mote is @xmath670    although i have been describing the motes as the same antennas that absorb light in the blackbox , the communication might be through a different class of smart dust entirely or by a different part of the motes than the antennas .",
    "the communication might be sent by optical laser , for example .",
    "but if we are considering broadcasts through individual antennas , then equation  [ sec : receivedpower ] reduces to the friis transmission equation : @xmath671 where @xmath672 is the gain of the transmitter and @xmath673 is the gain of the receiver @xcite .",
    "when considering the motes responsible for absorption , the time - averaged power sent by the transmitter is at most @xmath674 in equation  [ eqn : eharvestbest ] , when integrated over all frequencies . for convenience ,",
    "i define the spectrum shape as @xmath675 the received power during a transmission is only @xmath676 which comes out to @xmath677 if the signal is transmitted around at typical thermal background frequency of @xmath678 , this comes out to only 10 photons per year of active transmissions for the fiducial values .",
    "the time - averaged received power is smaller by a factor of @xmath663 .",
    "that s not all .",
    "the interior of the blackbox is filled with thermal radiation and interference from all the other notes , so the receiving mote is in a very noisy environment . given a gaussian noise power spectrum of @xmath679 , the rate of information transmission",
    "is limited by the channel capacity , @xmath680 d\\nu,\\ ] ] from @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath681 is the channel capacity during the transmission ; the time - averaged channel capacity @xmath682 is again smaller by a factor @xmath683 .",
    "according to @xcite , the optimum signal spectrum has a shape such that @xmath684 adds to a constant at the frequencies where @xmath679 is smallest .",
    "the worst case is white noise , with a flat noise spectrum and a flat signal spectrum .",
    "from an energy point of view , large signal - to - noise ratios are wasteful , since @xmath681 rises logarithmically with @xmath685 if @xmath686 .",
    "the detector is likely to be in thermal equilibrium with the surrounding radiation .",
    "since i am supposing that it is hooked up to an antenna , it could take the form of an electronic device in a circuit , in which case the thermal noise is the johnson noise @xcite , @xmath687 as long as the electronic detector is in thermal equilibrium with the outside radiation , this formula holds because of the zeroth law of thermodynamics , regardless of the details of the antenna or detector .",
    "if the transmission is entirely at low frequencies ( @xmath688 ) , then the johnson noise is simply thermal noise with @xmath689 .",
    "if johnson noise is the primary source of noise and the signal spectrum is @xmath690 , @xmath691 $ ] , where @xmath692 is the bandwidth .",
    "the channel capacity reduces to @xmath693 $ ] when the signal - to - noise ratio is small .",
    "thus , thermal noise limits the amount of information conveyed per unit energy to 1 bit per @xmath654 of energy @xcite , and the channel capacity to @xmath694 with a new mean receiver efficiency defined as @xmath695 when averaged over time , this is indeed small for isotropically - emitting motes : @xmath696    going to higher frequencies to avoid thermal noise may seem like a good idea , but it does not work out .",
    "as it turns out , the channel capacity is limited to 1 bit per @xmath654 of energy at all frequencies @xcite . in principle",
    ", this means that high frequencies are exactly as good as low frequencies in terms of information transfer per unit energy , with a @xmath697 near - infrared photon carrying up to 1600 bits in a 3 k environment .",
    "but that kind of information transfer is impractical , since in order to code @xmath698 bits , the encoder / decoder must be able to distinguish between @xmath699 states . in the case of the 1600 bit photon , this comes out to @xmath700 states .",
    "instead , it might be practical to get @xmath701 bits per photon by using the timing of the photon or spectroscopy .",
    "still assuming that the transmitter and receivers are antennas , then the channel capacity is limited to @xmath702 this time , the receiver efficiency is defined as @xmath703 so with these assumptions , the data transmission rate for a high frequency antenna system is actually poor : @xmath704 as the frequency increases towards the optical regime , the data rate plummets to the point that it takes millions of years just to communicate one bit .",
    "of course , optical communication is practical in our own technology because neither the detectors nor the receivers are isotropically emitting antennas .",
    "actual optical detectors have areas far greater than a square wavelength .",
    "furthermore , because optical wavelengths are much shorter than radio wavelengths , relatively small telescopes can magnify small portions of the sky , boosting the gains of both the transmitter and the receivers .    aside from thermal and quantum noise , there is also confusion noise from all of the other motes transmitting to each other along the line of sight . assuming these motes are oriented randomly , and that the emitting beams are wide enough that they do nt all miss the original receiving mote , the time - averaged confusion noise is @xmath705 the maximum distance along the sightline @xmath706 is either the distance to the edge of the blackbox , or the distance until a photon is absorbed , whichever is smaller . strictly speaking ,",
    "each of the motes on the sightline may transmit signals with a distinct spectrum , all of which might be different than the original transmitting mote , so @xmath707 averages over both time and motes . if all of the motes are using wideband signals near the wien peak of the thermal background , then the confusion noise is less than the thermal noise simply from energy conservation .",
    "but the confusion noise is always present , and it is important if ( 1 ) the motes transmissions are all confined to a bandwidth @xmath708 or ( 2 ) the transmissions are at high frequency where there is no thermal noise .    from the form of equation  [ eqn : confusionnoise ] ,",
    "it is clear that it is enormous compared to the neighboring mote s signal : @xmath709 it follows that the channel capacity is tiny , @xmath710 $ ] , which is @xmath711 assuming the frequency bandwidth is @xmath712 .",
    "the confusion noise is a fundamental limitation to the rate of information transfer .",
    "it is unaffected by the surrounding temperature .",
    "if one tries to assign each mote its own frequency channel , then the incredibly narrow bandwidth required cancels the improvement in signal - to - noise .",
    "if one tries to stagger the mote transmissions so that only a few are broadcasting at a given time , the time - average channel capacity is reduced in proportion to @xmath663 .",
    "more generally , one could try to assign each mote a `` signature '' signal or waveform that a receiver can pick out with a matched filter .",
    "but the signature must have a duration of at least @xmath713 to be reliably detected against the noise background , so equation  [ eqn : confusioncapacity ] is enforced .    still , the situation is not hopeless for would - be builders of a galactic internet .",
    "first , the motes could be designed with a high gain , beaming the transmissions .",
    "one way to do this would be to group motes into phased arrays , which could be scaled to arbitrarily large numbers .",
    "dense phased arrays ( with spacings @xmath714 ) have great freedom in beamforming , with the ability to steer the beam in almost any direction @xcite , so neither the transmitter nor the receiver needs to be aimed at the other ( although the transmitting array needs information on where the receiver is to steer the beam in its direction ) .    another solution is to arrange the motes in clusters , so that @xmath715 for motes within the clusters . in order to send messages between clusters ,",
    "some kind of relay is necessary .",
    "this relay may simply be all of the motes in the cluster working together . in this case , when one relay communicates with a neighboring relay , and both consist of @xmath716 motes , the signal - to - noise at the receiver is boosted as @xmath717 , even if there are no improvements in gain by beamforming .",
    "furthermore , there is no reason that the clusters themselves could nt be grouped into higher order clusters , and so on , until the network has a fractal topology .",
    "clustering does have the possible disadvantage of reducing the effective opacity from the motes ; this can be avoided if the clusters are ( at most ) two dimensional or are sparse .",
    "if none of the power transmitted in messages misses the receiver , landauer s principle sets the maximum channel capacity .",
    "the best possible @xmath681 is just @xmath718 , which is of order @xmath719 .",
    "again , this is not much faster than our own network speeds , but the blackbox does it on astronomical scales .    on a final note ,",
    "my calculations are based on the assumption that the channel between two motes is open forever .",
    "the optimal coding of information in the presence of noise is based around grouping large chunks of information ; otherwise equation  [ eqn : channelcapacity ] is not obtained @xcite .",
    "the successful receipt of a message , of course , requires at least one photon to be detected , but this is already considered in equation  [ eqn : quantumchannelcapacity ] , and at low frequencies ( @xmath720 ) , energy is the more stringent limit since more than one photon is needed to convey one bit in that case @xcite .",
    "i also suggested in section  [ sec : geniusloci ] that motes might be used to direct the flow of matter in the ism .",
    "the basic principle is the same as the natural driving of winds by radiation pressure on dust grains in stars and winds , but i want to show that it works in a blackbox - like environment too",
    ".    if the motes are to push the gas around , they must be able to transfer their momentum to the gas on time scales short compared to the ism s dynamical timescale .",
    "the simplest mechanism for this is drag , where the gas particles directly collide with the mote itself .",
    "consider a mote with a geometrical cross section @xmath721 moving at a speed @xmath567 relative to gas with mass density @xmath722 .",
    "the drag force is the drag pressure @xmath723 times the mote s cross section , and the deceleration time is @xmath724 if the mote is a solid cylinder , its mass is @xmath725 and its cross section is @xmath726 , where @xmath727 is a factor relating to the orientation of the mote .",
    "the drag time is then @xmath728    one way for a mote to accelerate is to act as a radiative thruster , broadcasting its momentum away in photons . only moderate",
    "beaming is required for a net force .",
    "the ( time - averaged ) maximum possible thrust is then @xmath729 .",
    "typical accelerations are @xmath730 in general , this is too slow to avoid colliding with motes unless the warning time is far greater than @xmath731 ( section  [ sec : collisions ] ) .",
    "note that the maximum thrust and the drag time together define a maximum relative velocity of the grains to the gas , @xmath732 .",
    "for a cylindrical antenna , @xmath733 this comes out to about 1 mpc per 10 gyr for an ism density of about @xmath734 .",
    "so , it should be possible to launch motes directly into a galactic halo or even into the igm without actually sending manufacturing facilities there , especially if they are injected into the hot , rarefied ism ( note that @xmath735 is much greater than the pull of gravity , which is usually around @xmath736 to @xmath737 in a disk galaxy ) .    we might expect the ism mass to be much greater than the total mass in motes .",

    "the maximum thrust the parcel can achieve is @xmath740 .",
    "since the motes are , to some extent , locked into the gas , the density in motes is probably roughly proportional to the gas density .",
    "thus , we can relate @xmath739 to the total mote mass in the blackbox , @xmath741 ( equation  [ eqn : dipolecloudmass ] ) , by a simple factor @xmath742 .",
    "then , @xmath743 this is enough to levitate gas out of the midplane of a disk galaxy if @xmath179 .",
    "note that for a small parcel , the maximum thrust is proportional to @xmath124 .",
    "it s more challenging to move a large , optically thick parcel .",
    "if the parcel is optically thick to its own thrust radiation , then only motes near the surface of the parcel contribute to the thrust of the parcel as a whole .",
    "if the parcel is optically thin to the thrust radiation , the thermodynamically useful energy flux is removed from the parcel within one optical depth of its surface .",
    "thus , if the optical depth of the parcel to thermal radiation is @xmath744 , @xmath745 is reduced by a factor @xmath746 compared to equation  [ eqn : agasopticallythin ] . when considering the ism as a whole , the maximum thrust is limited by the total momentum of the blackbox s radiation , so @xmath747 .",
    "photons are a poor propellant in an energy - limited environment , since they move at @xmath1 .",
    "if the motes ejected a material propellant at a mass rate @xmath748 , they could impart a speed of @xmath749 into it , for a total force of @xmath750 .",
    "although motes are tiny and unlikely to carry a spare load of propellant within them , they might conceivably harvest the matter around them , analogous to the ramscoop concept of interstellar travel .",
    "suppose a mote uses all gas that falls onto some capture area @xmath751 as propellant .",
    "it also continues to act as an antenna , heating the propellant with the thermodynamically useful flux of radiation .",
    "gas enters into @xmath751 with a mean speed of @xmath752 .",
    "if the mote is moving with a mach number greater than 1 , then @xmath752 is roughly the speed of the mote , but even if it is at rest with respect to the gas , atoms will still enter the capture area at roughly the speed of sound @xmath753 ( which is roughly @xmath754 at 3 k ) .",
    "let @xmath755 .",
    "then the maximum thrust possible is @xmath756    the ratio of thrusts from matter and photons is @xmath757 : @xmath758 if the mote is moving slowly in rarefied ism and only captures gas that actually hits it , then radiative emission provides a greater possible thrust . if the mote can capture gas across an area @xmath759 , perhaps using magnetic fields , then gaseous thrust is around a thousand times more potent . using captured gas propellant also is advantageous in low luminosity galaxies .",
    "planetary systems with small bodies conveniently provide the materials to build a planetary- or stellar - scale blackbox .",
    "a galactic - scale blackbox , though , requires so much materials that a large fraction of the ism must be mined .",
    "furthermore , the ism is incredibly diffuse , occupying cubic kiloparsecs . at first glance",
    ", it seems that something the size of a galaxy is needed to catch the metals necessary to build the blackbox in the first place .    the volume swept up by a blackbox s mote population approaches the total galactic volume over cosmological timescales , though .",
    "that is why the collision problem is so tough for blackboxes , although the collision cross section is much larger than a dipole antenna s geometrical cross section ( appendix  [ sec : collisions ] ) .",
    "thus , if the motes can replicate themselves using metals they sweep up from the ism , their population could grow exponentially until the ism is fully mined .",
    "alternatively , self - replicating nets might be launched ; these would harvest metals in order to grow catchments for ism metals , devoting a fraction of the consumed ism for mote manufacture .    the rate that material is harvested",
    "is estimated along the same lines as the capture of ism gas for use in thrusters ( appendix  [ sec : thrusters ] ) . for a general population of @xmath760 replicators ,",
    "each capturing ism that lands on an area @xmath751 as it moves at a speed @xmath752 , the rate of growth in the total mass of the replicators is @xmath761 where @xmath240 is the abundance of the elements that make up the motes .",
    "a general replicating machine might look like a very delicate sheet with surface density @xmath762 and a mass of @xmath763 .",
    "the time for population growth is @xmath764 : @xmath765    consider a cylindrical mote that harvests materials that impede onto its geometrical cross section @xmath766 ( see section  [ sec : thrusters ] for details ) .",
    "then , its effective surface density is @xmath767 .",
    "if it has the capability of building more motes with the harvested materials , the time for the mote population to grow by a factor of @xmath768 is @xmath769 although this is shorter than the age of the universe , the replication process probably would take several @xmath768-folds to complete .",
    "the harvest of the ism could be completed within a few gyr if the motes achieve @xmath770 with the use of radiative thrusting ( equation  [ eqn : vmaxmote ] ) , even starting from a small population . harvesting",
    "the icm of galaxy clusters , which is about a thousand times more rarefied than the ism , is a much slower process , however .",
    "the harvesting can also be sped up if the replicators take advantage of the clumping of the ism . the supersonic turbulence in the cold",
    ", molecular ism concentrates most of the h@xmath771 mass into clouds that are overdense by a factor of @xmath772 @xcite . nor do the motes necessarily have to seek out these clouds ; they could simply ride along with the gas , following most of it into the clumps .",
    "while only a minority of the galactic ism s mass is cold and molecular , gas mixes between the phases on timescales of @xmath773 200 myr @xcite .",
    "this strategy will not work in the icm , however , where the turbulence is subsonic and density fluctuations are relatively small @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to use a separate class of replicators to actually harvest the ism more efficiently , and only reprocess that material into motes later .",
    "a more efficient geometry for harvesting the ism would be a very thin sheet only a few nanometers thick , perhaps made of graphene or carbon nanotubes , with @xmath774 .",
    "then , these sheets would have a population growth time of @xmath775 if combined with a faster @xmath752 , or if they spend most of their time in molecular clouds , an initially small population could collect much of the ism s metals within the fermi - hart timescale of a few myr . once again , though , population growth in a cluster s diffuse icm is probably too slow to have been achieved yet .",
    "further savings in @xmath762 are possible if the sheets are porous ; although this would make it harder to refine gas phase metals in the ism , the replicator could still capture solid interstellar dust grains and slowly digest them .",
    "of course , individual replicators could not grow exponentially in size for long , because of the time it would take to circulate materials towards their edges . instead",
    ", these sheets could be made to fragment once they grew to a certain size , keeping the circulation times reasonable .",
    "a variation of this budding process might release motes into the ism . or",
    ", these replicators might be like autotrophs in our own ecosystem , with the motes ( or mote - producing machines ) being heterotrophs that eat the sheets ."
