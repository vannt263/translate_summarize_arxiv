    ", we can estimate the temperature and metallicity distributions of the ism and reveal the metal enrichment history of the universe .    in the past ,",
    "x - ray imaging detectors , such as chandra acis or xmm - newton epic , have observed the ism with high angular resolution and high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) or wide field of view , and revealed temperature structures , surface brightness and mass distributions ( e.g. , buote 2002 ; buote et al . 2003 ; fukazawa et al .",

    "it is also necessary to have an accurate estimate of the foreground galactic thermal emission .",
    "the best detector to satisfy these conditions is the suzaku xis which has a better energy resolution and a lower background than any previous x - ray ccd camera . the launch of the suzaku xis ( koyama et al .",
    "2007 ) with high energy resolution in the lower energy x - ray band allows us to obtain o and mg abundance distributions through accurate measurements of their emission lines .",

    "the fit is acceptable for all the regions .",
    "the o abundance is measured up to 1012 and mg , si and fe to 1228 for the first time . however , the ne abundance is not reliable because ne line measurements are influenced by nearby fe - l lines , which can not be resolved with the resolution of the xis .",
    "it can be seen from figure 3 that the galactic emission is well reproduced and significantly contributes to the spectra in the outer region , and thus it must be accurately estimated to derive the o abundance of ngc 4636 . as a result , even for o , the abundances in the outer regions are determined up to 10 with @xmath030% accuracy . even if we allow the temperature of the bremss ( 7kev ) component to vary , the metal abundances only change within errors so we believe that they are reliable .",
    "the luminosity of the hard x - ray component of the bremss model is 1.5@xmath1510@xmath28 erg s@xmath7 over 210 kev within 6 of ngc 4636 .",
    "this is consistent with the asca results ( matsushita et al .",
    "1994 ) , indicating that the hard x - ray component is due to lmxb .",
    "we also confirmed that the abundance results are almost the same when we fit the hard component with a power - law of index 1.5 , which was used for the lmxb estimation in loewenstein et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . in the central region ,",
    "the reduced-@xmath24 is a little larger than that in the outer region .",
    "this might be due to temperature structure in the center region ( ohto et al . 2003 ) so we tried fitting with a two - temperature model only in the 02 region .",
    "we assumed that the metal abundances are the same for both temperature components . comparing the result with that of the single - temperature model ,",
    "the metal abundances do not greatly change and the temperature of the hot component in the two - temperature model is almost the same as that in the single - temperature .",
    "the f - test probability is 0.097% and thus the improvement is marginal .",
    "therefore , hereafter we focus on the results with the single - temperature model .",
    "a fit residual around 0.7 kev in the 02 region is discussed and analyzed in  3.4 .",
    "distributions of temperature and metal abundances are plotted against radius ( kpc ) in figures 4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "systematic errors due to the gxe , cxb , and nxb are also shown .",
    "the systematic errors due to the gxe are estimated by varying the normalizations of the apec model for the mwh and lhb within their error ranges , which are comparable to the x - ray count fluctuation ( 15% ) of the rosat all - sky x - ray background survey ( band 4 ) for the ngc 4636 region .",
    "the systematic errors due to the cxb and nxb are at most 5% ( tawara et al . 2008 ) , respectively , and they are dominant in the hard x - ray band .",
    "therefore , the systematic errors on the temperature and metal abundances are mostly caused by the gxe uncertainty .",
    "a 15% uncertainty in the estimate of the xis optical blocking filter thickness introduces systematic errors comparable to those from the gxe . the temperature in the central region is 0.64 kev , rising to 0.70.8 kev .",
    "this profile is consistent with that from asca ( matsushita et al .",
    "1997 ) , xmm - newton ( xu et al . 2002 ) and chandra ( ohto et al .",
    "2003 ) and the temperature distribution is barely affected by any systematic errors in the gxe . for the inner 50 kpc most metal abundances are tightly restricted thanks to the high energy resolution of the suzaku xis while in the outer regions the abundances are less well constrained due to the gxe systematic errors . however , the ne abundance is not reliable because ne lines are confused with fe - l lines .",
    "furthermore , only upper limits could be obtained on the o and ne abundances in the 60140 kpc region , since their uncertainties are very large due to contamination by the galactic emission .",
    "it can been seen that all the metal abundances are 0.72.5 solar in the central region , and decrease down to 0.31.0 solar towards the outer region . in the central region ,",
    "the o and fe abundances are about 1.2 times larger than that obtained with the rgs ( xu et al .",
    "figure 6 shows confidence contours of o and mg abundances against the fe abundance .",
    "the o and mg to fe abundance ratio are particularly important to constrain the contribution of different types of supernovae . although the individual errors for each metal abundance are large , the abundance ratios are constrained well , especially for the mg to fe abundance ratio in the outermost region .",
    "c    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      the gas mass distributions of ngc 4636 and ngc 1399 are shown in figure 10 , which also shows the chandra results within 0.022 @xmath3 ( @xmath1 15.6 kpc ) ( fukazawa et al .",
    "2006 ) and the asca results beyond this radius ( matsushita et al .",
    "these results show that the gas mass of ngc 4636 is about half as much as that of ngc 1399 .",
    "this is possibly because ngc 1399 sits at the center of the fornax cluster , where the potential is deeper than that for ngc 4636 ( figure 4 ) , so the gas is more tightly bound by ngc 1399 .",
    "the ngc 4636 metal mass distributions and metal - mass - to - light - ratios ( mlr ) of o and fe are shown in figures 11(a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "the metal mass is obtained by multiplying the metal abundance value in the outermost region in figure 5 with the gas mass distribution ( figure 10 ) .",
    "the stellar light distribution is quoted from fukazawa et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "c    cc    figure 11(a ) shows that the o and fe mass distributions are similar between the two galaxies and the metal mass of ngc 4636 is almost the same as that of ngc 1399 at all radii . combining this with the difference of the gas mass",
    ", it can be understood that the abundance and the gas mass of ngc 4636 are about twice and half those of ngc 1399 , respectively . as seen in figure 11(b ) , mlr of ngc 4636 is also 2@xmath03 times larger than that of ngc 1399 in all regions for both metals .",
    "this indicates that the metals in the ism are distributed more compactly in ngc 4636 ; the metals in ngc 4636 do not diffuse so widely .",
    "this difference might be caused by environmental effects ; galaxy interaction is frequent for ngc 1399 and thus metal - rich gas could be stirred by galaxy motions .    finally , we compared the mlr of ngc 4636 with suzaku results of other groups and clusters .",
    "these objects are galaxy groups centered on ngc 1399 , ngc 5044 , and ngc 507 .",
    "they are x - ray bright elliptical galaxies like ngc 4636 , but the galaxy density is high around them and thus they are identified as centers of galaxy groups .",
    "we also compare with galaxy clusters such as abell 262 , abell 1060 , awm 7 , and centaurus . following sato at al .",
    "( 2009b ) , we plot the correlation between temperature and mlr at 0.1 @xmath3 in figure 12 .",

    "hcg 62 exhibit a spherically symmetric x - ray emission , and ngc 4636 has the lowest mlr among them . a possible correlation between temperature and mlr",
    "is suggested only for these spherically symmetric objects .",
    "such a correlation could be explained by higher temperature systems possessing a deeper gravitational potential which prevents dispersal of the metals .",
    "although galaxy velocity dispersion is larger for higher temperature clusters , there are no big galaxies around cd galaxies .",
    "therefore , we think that the deep potential can confine the metals even if a small galaxy passes around the cd galaxy . on the other hand , the x - ray asymmetric groups ngc 1399 and ngc 507 show a relatively low mlr .",
    "these imply that ngc 1399 and ngc 507 experience galaxy interactions frequently and metal - rich gas could be stirred by galaxy motions .",

    "* we found out that the o and fe radial mass distributions are similar between ngc 4636 and ngc 1399 .",
    "this indicates that both objects have similar metal diffusion processes .",
    "however the mlr of ngc 4636 is 2@xmath03 times larger than that of ngc 1399 , possibly due to ngc 4636 confining more metal - rich gas .",
    "the mlr of ngc 4636 is @xmath05 times smaller than that of groups and clusters of galaxies and there may be a correlation between the temperature and mlr in other spherical groups .",
    "* we confirmed resonance scattering in the fe @xmath4 line in the central region of ngc 4636 , first suggested by the xmm - newton rgs results .",
    "the optical depth in the central region is , 24.1 @xmath51 56.3 , and thus it is extremely optically thick in the central region if there is no turbulence .",

    "<S> ngc 4636 , an x - ray bright elliptical galaxy , was observed for 70 ks with suzaku . </S>",
    "<S> the low background and good energy resolution of the xis enable us to estimate the foreground galactic emission accurately and hence measure , for the first time , the o , mg , si and fe abundances out to a radius of @xmath028 arcmin ( @xmath1 140 kpc ) . </S>",
    "<S> these metal abundances are as high as @xmath21 solar within the central 4 and decrease by @xmath050% towards the outer regions . </S>",
    "<S> further , the o to fe abundance ratio is about 0.601.0 solar in all regions analyzed , indicating that the products of both sne ii and sne ia have mixed and diffused to the outer regions of the galaxy . the o and fe metal mass - to - light - ratios ( mlr ) of ngc 4636 are 23 times larger than those of ngc 1399 implying that metal distributions in ngc 4636 are less extended than those in ngc 1399 , possibly due to environmental factors , such as frequency of galaxy interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we also found that the mlrs of ngc 4636 at 0.1 @xmath3 are @xmath05 times smaller than those of clusters of galaxies , possibly consistent with the correlation between temperature and mlr of other spherically symmetric groups of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we also confirmed a resonant scattering signature in the fe @xmath4 line in the central region , as previously reported using the xmm - newton rgs . </S>"
