    "penrose s definition of _ asymptotic simplicity _ is an attempt to provide a characterisation of isolated systems in general relativity @xcite .",
    "it offers a framework on which diverse notions of physical interest can be defined and handled in a precise and rigorous manner .",
    "there is , however , a notorious lack of nontrivial examples where the associated formalism see e.g. @xcite has been actually been used to extract some physics .",
    "the obvious reason for this is the scarcity of radiative exact solutions to the einstein field equations other than the boost - rotation symmetric ones @xcite . a more conspicuous consideration in this regard",
    "is the fact that radiative spacetimes have to be constructed starting from an initial value problem where , say , some cauchy initial data are provided .",
    "up to fairly recently , there has not been a way of relating the properties of the initial data to the radiative properties of the development .",
    "for example , how does an initial data set have to be so that the resulting spacetime _ peels _ ?",
    "that is , the components of the weyl tensor in an adapted gauge having a distinctive decay in terms of powers of an affine parameter of the generators of outgoing light cones @xcite .",
    "another natural question on these lines would be how does the adm mass and the bondi mass relate ?",
    "similarly , is there any relation between the angular momentum defined at spatial infinity and that defined at null infinity ? which classes of initial data allow to select the poincar group out of the group of asymptotic symmetries",
    "the bms group in a canonical fashion ?    arguably , there is a shortage of general results about the evolution of initial data sets for the einstein field equations near spatial infinity .",
    "this particular has made the idea of relating the structure of initial data with radiative properties a daunting endeavour .",
    "however , work by friedrich @xcite on the _ regular initial value problem at spatial infinity _ for time symmetric initial data sets has provided a tool to address questions similar to the ones raised in the first paragraph through a systematic approach .",
    "friedrich has introduced a representation of spatial infinity as a cylinder _the cylinder at spatial infinity _",
    ", @xmath0 in stark contrast to the usual representation as a point .",
    "the cylinder at spatial infinity can be regarded as a limit set of incoming and outgoing characteristics of the einstein field equations , and as such it happens to be a _",
    "total characteristic_. as such , it allows to transport information from the cauchy surface to null infinity without being contaminated by any sort of boundary conditions .",
    "the construction which led to the cylinder at spatial infinity allows an unfolding of the evolution process , which in turn can be analysed in all detail and to the desired order .",
    "the latter can be thought of as enabling the construction of a certain kind of asymptotic expansions which are completely determined by the cauchy data near infinity .",
    "friedrich s seminal work has been extended in several directions , automatising , in some sense , the calculation of the asymptotic expansions of the relevant field quantities @xcite and to include more general classes of initial data sets @xcite .",
    "the analysis described in these references has exhibited the existence of a hierarchy of obstructions to the smoothness of null infinity which goes beyond that arising from a mere consideration of the linear aspects of the field equations as described in e.g. @xcite .",
    "the existence of the hierarchy of obstructions has nurtured a _ rigidity conjecture _ on the smoothness of null infinity which , broadly speaking , states that the only cauchy initial data sets which have a development with a smooth null infinity . ]",
    "are those which are stationary close to infinity .",
    "similarly , a given degree of differentiability at null infinity , say @xmath1 , would only be possible if the initial data is stationary to a given order which depends on @xmath2 .",
    "the kind of initial data required can be constructed by means of the gluing techniques of @xcite . intuitively , the absence of gravitational radiation near spatial infinity which the rigidity conjecture asserts , suggests that the incoming radiation has to die off in the infinite future , and at the same time the system can not have emitted gravitational waves for all times in the infinite past .",
    "now , the calculation of the asymptotic expansions which arise from the construction of the cylinder at infinity is performed in a gauge which is adapted to a cauchy initial value problem remarkably , the gauge also allows to read off the structure and location of infinity directly from the initial data . on the other hand ,",
    "the discussion of the gravitational field near null infinity is usually done using a gauge which is based on geometric structures of null hypersurfaces .",
    "having two different gauges , hampers , to a certain extent , extracting the physics of the system .",
    "it also difficults the attempts to assess the relevance of the presence of obstructions to the smoothness to null infinity in the asymptotic expansions .",
    "one of the aspects of the analysis of the asymptotic behaviour of the gravitational field via the definition of asymptotic simplicity and related constructions is that it allows to rephrase the decay of the fields in terms of differentiability at the conformal boundary .",
    "thus , it is natural to expect that the presence of obstructions to smoothness in the asymptotic expansions may result in a modified peeling behaviour this idea has already been explored in @xcite .    a first study of the transformation between the gauge used in friedrich s analysis of spatial infinity and the gauge generally used to discuss null infinity has been given in @xcite . in the present article their analysis will be extended to the developments of a class of initial data sets which are not time symmetric .",
    "the consideration of initial data sets with a non - vanishing second fundamental form will allow us to examine some time asymmetric aspects of the structure of the conformal boundary of asymptotically flat spacetimes which up to now have remained _ terra incognita .",
    "_ on the other hand , the discussion shall be restricted to conformally flat initial data sets .",
    "this is done for conciseness and for the ease of calculations and presentation .",
    "previous analysis with conformally flat initial data sets see e.g. @xcite have shown that most of the crucial phenomena and structure observed in this setting admit a counterpart when discussing non - conformally flat data sets like in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the detailed understanding of conformally flat initial data sets is of relevance in view of their use in the numerical simulation of black hole spacetimes see e.g. @xcite for a recent discussion on this .",
    "a cautionary note is , however , due : most of the conformally flat initial sets considered in the numerical simulations are boosted .",
    "this is done on physical grounds . here , initial data sets with linear momentum i.e .",
    "boosted will not be considered .",
    "the reason being that , as it will be discussed in the sequel , they are more technically involved and less smooth .",
    "the effects of this lower regularity are of interest in themselves and will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "the article is structured as follows : section [ section : basic_setup ] discusses some ideas of the basis set up and fixes some notation ; section [ section : f - gauge ] describes some aspects of the `` cylinder at spatial infinity''-formalism ; section [ section : constraints ] considers relevant aspects of the class of initial data sets to be used ; section [ section : expansions ] muses over the asymptotic expansions that can be calculated using the cylinder at spatial infinity ; section [ section : np - gauge ] goes briefly about the construction of a frame adapted to null infinity the np gauge while section [ section : relating_gauges ] discusses how it is related to the gauge used in the expansions of section [ section : expansions ] .",
    "this article revisits the analysis carried out in @xcite of `` bondi type '' systems what here is called the newman - penrose gauge and combines it with the asymptotic expansions for the development of conformally flat initial data sets which have been calculated in @xcite . in section [ section :",
    "peeling ] analysis of the implications of these expansions and the related obstructions to the smoothness of null infinity is done under some existence and regularity assumptions . in section [ section : sigma ]",
    "the machinery is used to calculate expansions of the spin coefficient @xmath3 on null infinity in the np gauge .",
    "the behaviour of this coefficient is related to various physical aspects of the theory of isolated systems .",
    "the implications of these expansions are analysed .",
    "it is shown that if the spacetime peels , then the behaviour of @xmath3 is such that it is always possible to single out the poincar group out of the asymptotic symmetry group in a canonical way .",
    "expansions of the bondi mass are also considered . in section [ section : np - constants ] the formalism is used to write down the newman - penrose constants of the developments of the class of initial data under consideration in terms of initial data quantities .",
    "these expressions allow to show that the constants at future null infinity are equal to those at past null infinity .",
    "there is much more to the aforementioned analysis than what is presented in this article . in particular , most of the calculations involved in the analysis have been carried out using _ ex profeso _ scripts in the computer algebra system maple v. a first subset of the scripts constructs the initial data ; another subset determines the coefficients of the asymptotic expansions in terms of initial data quantities ; finally a third subset calculates the transformation between gauges and allows to calculate the asymptotic expansions of np objects . in order to keep the presentation at a reasonable length , the explicit expressions of intermediate steps will be omitted , and more emphasis will be put on to the qualitative aspects of the results . some familiarity with the use of spinors in particular the space - spinor formalism of @xcite will be assumed .",
    "details of the diverse other formalisms used the cylinder at spatial infinity , the formalism of null infinity , the construction of gauges , and how to relate them is kept to the minimum necessary to motivate the analysis and to point out the many subtleties arising . in any case",

    "in contrast , the representation of @xcite depicts spatial infinity as a cylinder the cylinder at spatial infinity .",

    "friedrich s construction makes use of a blow up of the infinity of the initial hypersurface to @xmath34 .",

    "this extra dimension can be interpreted as giving rise to the spin - weight of the diverse spinorial objects when lifted from @xmath23 to @xmath49 .",

    "the assumption of axial symmetry allows to carry the calculations up to a couple of orders more .",
    "an important question in the programme is the sense if any in which the expansions ( [ v_ansatz ] ) and ( [ phi_ansatz ] ) approximate the solutions of the equations ( [ evolution_upsilon])-([evolution_bianchi ] ) . in particular",
    ", one would like to be able to estimate the residues    @xmath174    the estimation of the above residues and proving that the asymptotic expansions actually do approximate the solution to the conformal field equations is one of the remaining outstanding problems in the analysis of the structure of spatial infinity .",
    "it is expected that some suitable extension of the estimates discussed in @xcite in the case of the spin-2 massless field ( linearised gravity ) will permit to remove this hurdle .",
    "some of the technical complications of the problem lie in the degeneracy of the principal part of the equations ( [ evolution_bianchi ] ) and ( [ bianchi_propagation_transport_eqns ] ) at the critical sets @xmath175 , which precludes the use of standard methods of the theory of partial differential equation .",

    "[ theorem : equality ] for the class of initial data given by ( [ assumption : initialdata ] ) and under assumption [ assumption : existence ] , the newman - penrose constants at @xmath67 are equal to those at @xmath68 .",
    "more precisely , one has that @xmath400 where    @xmath401    it is noted that the integrand of the formula ( [ monster_1 ] ) can be written concisely as : @xmath402    from where it can more easily be seen that the constants have the structure : @xmath403    in the view of the above formulae , it is natural to ponder what would happen if one were to consider a more general class of initial data sets .",
    "it is to be expected that the theorem [ theorem : equality ] will still hold if one considers non - conformally flat initial data , for the time asymmetry in the solutions of the einstein constraint equations is fed by the second fundamental form , not by the conformal metric .",
    "if one were to consider boosted initial data , it is quite plausible that null infinity may not be regular enough recall the existence of logarithms in the initial data discussed in section [ section : constraints] to ensure the constancy of @xmath404 and @xmath405 unless , perhaps if the initial data set is not maximal , like in the case of boosted slices of schwarzschild .",
    "the present article has been concerned with an analysis of the physical implications of certain asymptotic expansions for asymptotically flat spacetimes which allow to relate the behaviour near null and spatial infinity to properties of the initial data .",
    "these asymptotic expansions are obtained in a gauge which exploits to the maximum the conformal structure of the spacetime .",
    "hence , in order to gain intuition on the physics of these expansions one has to transform to a more `` physical gauge '' .",
    "crucial feature of the expansions is that they bring to the foreground the fact that the development of generic initial data will render a non - smooth conformal boundary of the spacetime .",
    "this non - smoothness manifests itself in the appearance of logarithmic terms in the solutions to the transport equations which generate the terms in the asymptotic expansions .",
    "it has to be emphasised that these logarithmic terms are conformal invariants of the spacetime and not the product of some bad choice of gauge . in other words",
    "one could completely forget about the f - gauge and the cylinder spacetime , but one would still have to confront in one way or another their implications as the discussion about the peeling behaviour in section [ section : peeling ] evidences . on a more practical side ,",
    "it is not clear what the implications for numerical simulations of the non - smoothness of null infinity are .",
    "as seen here , as long as no linear momentum is included in the reference asymptotic end , the smoothness of most conformally flat initial data sets of interest is enough peeling so that most of the @xmath406 formalism remains untouched .",
    "an interesting and in principle not evident result from our calculations is the fact that the np constants in the cases for which they are well defined offer a set of absolute conserved quantities for the whole spacetime , and not too different for each component of null infinity .",
    "it has been argued that this feature will be preserved in the case of more general initial data sets .",
    "further , a simple computation also reveals that the logarithmic np constants should also share this feature .",
    "finally , it has been seen that under certain existence assumptions having the peeling behaviour automatically implies the right kind of behaviour of the asymptotic shear at null infinity to obtain a canonical representative of the poincar group out of the bms group .",
    "this result exemplifies the power and insights that can be gained by methods presented in this work . at this point",
    "it would be natural to proceed with a discussion of angular momentum .",
    "however , as the result of the non - existence of conformally flat slices in the kerr and other ( non - static ) stationary spacetimes exposes , there is a certain non - cooperation between conformal flatness and the presence of angular momentum at null infinity see e.g. @xcite .",
    "so it seems that a more natural setting for this analysis is that of non - conformally flat metrics .",
    "this last issue and other questions raised in this article will be further dwell upon elsewhere .",
