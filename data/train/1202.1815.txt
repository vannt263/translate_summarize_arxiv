    "walker first noticed @xcite that the endomorphism induced in a @xmath1-tqft ( defined over a field ) by the exterior of a closed off seifert surface of a knot in zero - framed surgery along the knot can be used to give lower bounds for the genus of the knot .",
    "he did this by showing the number of non - zero eigenvalues of this endomorphism counted with multiplicity is an invariant @xcite , i.e. it does not depend on the choice of the seifert surface .",
    "thus the number of such eigenvalues must be less than or equal to the dimension of the vector space that the tqft assigns to a closed surface of this minimal genus .",
    "next turaev and viro @xcite , again assuming the tqft is defined over a field , saw that the similarity class of the induced map on the vector space associated to a seifert surface modulo the generalized @xmath2-eigenspace was a stronger invariant .",
    "if the tqft is defined over a more general commutative ring , the second author observed that the strong shift equivalence class of the endomorphism is an invariant of the knot @xcite .",
    "strong shift equivalence ( abbreviated sse ) is a notion from symbolic dynamics which we will discuss in  [ sse ] below . for a tqft defined over a field @xmath3 ,",
    "the similarity class considered by turaev - viro is a complete invariant of sse . in this case",
    ", the vector space modulo the generalized @xmath2-eigenspace together with the induced automorphism , considered as a module over @xmath4 $ ] , is called the turaev - viro module .",
    "it should be considered as somewhat analogous to the alexander module .",
    "the order of the turaev - viro module is called the turaev - viro polynomial and lies in @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "we will refer to the endomorphisms constructed as above ( and those in the same sse class ) as turaev - viro endomorphisms .    in @xcite ,",
    "turaev - viro endomorphisms were studied and methods for computing the endomorphism explicitly were given .",
    "these methods adapted rolfsen s surgery technique of studying infinite cyclic covers of knots .",
    "this method requires finding a surgery description of the knot ; that is a framed link in the complement of the unknot such that the framed link describes @xmath5 and the unknot represents the original knot .",
    "moreover each of the components of the framed link should have linking number zero with the unknot . for this method to work ,",
    "it is important that the surgery presentation have a nice form . in this paper",
    ", we will show that all knots have a surgery presentations of this form ( in fact an even nicer form that we will call standard . )",
    "another explicit method of computation was given by achir , and blanchet @xcite .",
    "this method starts with any seifert surface .",
    "the second author also considered the further invariant obtained by decorating a knot with a colored meridian ( this was needed to give formulas for the turaev - viro endomorphism of a connected sum , and to use the turaev - viro endomorphism to compute the quantum invariants of branched cyclic covers of the knot ) .",
    "ohtsuki @xcite arrived at the same invariant as the turaev - viro polynomial but from a very different point of view .",
    "ohtsuki extracts this invariant from a surgery description of a knot ( alternatively of a closed 3-manifold with a primitive one dimensional cohomology class ) and the data of a modular category .",
    "his method starts from any surgery description standard or not .",
    "this is a significant advantage of his approach .",
    "ohtsuki s proof of the invariance of the polynomial in @xcite is only sketched .",
    "he stated that his invariant is the same as the turaev - viro polynomial , but does not give an explanation .",
    "recently viro has returned to these ideas @xcite .",
    "he has studied the turaev - viro endomorphism of a knot after coloring both the meridian and the longitude of the knot .",
    "viro observed that a weighted sum of the traces of these endomorphisms is the colored jones polynomial evaluated at a root of unity .    in @xcite ,",
    "turaev - viro endomorphisms were defined more generally for infinite cyclic cover of 3-manifolds .",
    "suppose @xmath6 is a closed connected oriented @xmath7-manifold @xmath8 with @xmath9 such that @xmath10 is onto .",
    "let @xmath11 be the infinite cyclic cover of @xmath8 corresponding to @xmath12 .",

    ", it is proved that the strong shift equivalent class of @xmath17 is an invariant of the pair @xmath6 , i.e. it does not depend on the choice of @xmath13 .",
    "we denote this sse class by @xmath18",
    ". we will sometimes refer to a pair @xmath19 as above , informally , as a 3-manifold with an infinite cyclic covering .",
    "the knot invariants discussed above can be obtained as special cases of the above invariants of 3-manifolds with an infinite cyclic covering . for any _ oriented _ knot @xmath0 in @xmath5 , we obtain an extended @xmath7-manifold @xmath20 by doing @xmath2-surgery along @xmath0 .",
    "we choose @xmath12 to be the integral cohomology class that evaluates to @xmath21 on a positive meridian of @xmath0 .",
    "then it is easy to see that the invariant @xmath22 corresponding to @xmath23 only depends on @xmath0 .",
    "if our tqft is defined for 3-manifolds with colored links , one may obtain further invariants by coloring the meridian and the longitude ( a little further away ) of the knot .    for the knot invariants discussed above ,",
    "it is required , in general , that @xmath0 be oriented .",
    "] this is so that the exterior of a seifert surface acquires a direction as a cobordism from the seifert surface to itself .",
    "however , we decided to delay mentioning this technicality .",
    "to avoid issues that arise from phase anomalies in tqft , in this paper , we work with extended manifolds as in walker @xcite and turaev @xcite . in this introduction ,",
    "we omit mention of the integer weights and lagrangian subspaces of extended manifolds .",
    "we discuss extended manifolds carefully in the main text .      inspired by ohtsuki",
    ", we construct a sse class @xmath24 from a framed ( or banded ) tangle in @xmath25 that arises in a surgery presentation of @xmath6 .",
    "we call this the tangle endomorphism .",
    "moreover we show that the endomorphism ( or square matrix ) that ohtsuki considers in this situation is well defined up to sse . by relating",
    "the definition of the turaev - viro endomorphism to ohtsuki s matrix , we give a different proof of the invariance of ohtsuki s invariant .",
    "in fact , we show that ohtsuki s matrix has the same sse class as the turaev - viro endomorphism , i.e. @xmath26 .",
    "we do not prove these results in the general case of a tqft arising from a modular category .",
    "we only work in the context of the skein approach for tqfts associated to @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "we work with a modified blanchet - habegger - masbaum - vogel approach @xcite as outlined in @xcite .",
    "this theory is defined over a slightly localized cyclotomic ring of integers .",
    "it is worthwhile studying endomorphisms defined up to strong shift equivalence over this ring rather than passing to a field .",
    "we show that the traces of the turaev - viro polynomial of knots with the meridian and longitude colored turns out to encode exactly the same information as the colored jones polynomial evaluated at a root of unity .      in section [ preliminary ] , we discuss extended manifolds , a variant of the tqft constructed in @xcite , surgery presentations and the definition of sse . in section [ thetanglemorphism ] ,",
    "we construct an endomorphism for each framed tangle in @xmath25 and apply it to the tangle obtained from a surgery presentation of an infinite cyclic cover of a 3-manifold .",
    "we call it the tangle endomorphism",
    ". then we state theorem [ main ] which states that the sse class of a tangle endomorphism constructed from a surgery presentation of @xmath19 is an of invariant @xmath19 . in section [ tvm ] ,",
    "we discuss technical details concerning the turaev - viro endomorphism for @xmath6 , and the method of calculating @xmath29 introduced in @xcite . in section [ relation ] , we relate the tangle endomorphism associated to a nice surgery presentation to the corresponding turaev - viro endomorphism . in section [ pmt ] , we prove theorem [ main ] . in section [ cj ] , we give formulas relating the colored jones polynomial to the traces of turaev - viro endomorphism of a knot whose meridian and longitude are colored . in section [ example ] , we compute two examples to illustrate these ideas .",
