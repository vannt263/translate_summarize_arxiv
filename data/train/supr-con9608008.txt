    "the origin of the irreversibility line ( irl ) in the field - temperature ( @xmath3 ) phase diagram of high - temperature superconductors ( hts ) is intriguing and still a widely discussed topic .",
    "experimentally , this line is defined as the border line at which the magnetic response of the sample changes from irreversible to reversible . in hts , large fluctuations and relatively weak pinning lead to a rich @xmath3 phase diagram with a variety of dynamic and static transitions which can be responsible for the appearance of magnetic reversibility .",
    "thus , a thorough experimental investigation of the irl is important for the understanding of the vortex - lattice behavior in superconductors in general and of the mechanisms responsible for the onset of irreversible magnetic response , in particular .",
    "several models , like thermally activated depinning , vortex - lattice melting and a transition from vortex glass to vortex fluid @xcite , were proposed to identify the origin of the irl in hts .",
    "also , attention was given to the possibility of pinning in the vortex - liquid phase and to different dissipation mechanisms above the melting line @xcite .",
    "irreversibility due to geometrical @xcite or surface barriers @xcite have also been proposed , but these mechanisms are less probable in thin @xmath4 films with strong pinning .",
    "the irreversibility line may be affected by sample - dependent properties such as the nature and density of pinning centers and by intrinsic or extrinsic anisotropy .",
    "for example , in superconductors with columnar defects , the irreversibility line may either be identified with the bose - glass transition , or related to the concept of a trapping angle @xcite .",
    "the configuration of the columnar defects is also very important , since it affects possibility for different types of depinning mechanism . a splayed configuration , for example , inhibits creep from columnar defects @xcite .",
    "similarly  crossed  defects ( i.e. defects at angles @xmath5 ) were shown to act collectively , i.e. , they introduce unidirectional anisotropy such that the current density reaches its maximum for magnetic field directed in a mid angle between defects @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the situation is even more complex , since different techniques ( magnetization loops , field - cool vs. zero - field - cool dc magnetization , peak in the imaginary part of the first harmonic etc . )",
    "yield different irls @xcite . to a great extent , the reliability of the determination of irl depends on the criterion for the onset of the irreversibility .",
    "we determine the irreversibility temperature at given dc field by the onset of third harmonic in the @xmath6 response , which , we believe , is one of the most reliable methods for contactless determination of the irl @xcite .",
    "in most experiments @xmath7 is measured as a function of the external field @xmath8 .",
    "this information is insufficient to distinguish between different models for the origin of the irreversibility .",
    "additional information , like the frequency dependence of the irl or its angular variation , is needed .",
    "in this paper we report on a study of the angular dependence of the irreversibility temperature @xmath0 in thin @xmath4 ( @xmath9 ) films before and after irradiation with pb ions .",
    "the @xmath10 @xmath9 films were  sandwiched  between @xmath11 layers @xcite .",
    "first , a @xmath12 layer of @xmath11 was deposited on a @xmath13 substrate .",
    "then , the @xmath9 film was laser ablated on top of the @xmath14 and finally , the @xmath9 was covered by a protective @xmath15 layer of @xmath11 .",
    "all three samples have the same lateral dimensions of @xmath16 .",
    "one film , denoted as @xmath17 , was used as a reference sample .",
    "the other two , _ uir _ and _  cir _ , were irradiated at ganil with @xmath18 @xmath19 pb ions along the @xmath20axis and along @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "( _ uir _ and _  cir _ stand for  uniform irradiation  and  crossed irradiation  , respectively ) .",
    "the superconducting transition temperatures , measured by a _ quantum design squid _ susceptometer and defined as the onset of the meissner expulsion in a dc field of @xmath22 , are @xmath23 for the samples _ ref _ and _ uir _ and @xmath24 for _ cir_.    for the @xmath6 measurements reported below we used a miniature @xmath25  @xmath26 insb hall - probe , which was positioned in the center of the sample .",
    "the @xmath27 @xmath6 magnetic field , always parallel to the @xmath20 axis , was induced by a small coil surrounding the sample .",
    "an external @xmath28 magnetic field , up to @xmath29 , could be applied at any direction @xmath30 with respect to the @xmath20 axis . in our experiments",
    "@xmath31 magnetic field was always turned on at a fixed angle at @xmath32 and then the @xmath6 response was recorded during sample cooling .",
    "the irreversibility temperature , @xmath33 is defined as the onset of the third harmonic signal in the @xmath6 response measured by the hall probe @xcite .",
    "this procedure was repeated for various @xmath28 fields and at various angles @xmath34 of the field with respect to the @xmath20axis .",
    "fig . [ rawdata ] presents measurements of @xmath35 , the third harmonic in the _ ac _ response , versus temperature @xmath36 , during field - cooling at @xmath37 for the sample _ ref _ at various angles between @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "apparently , as the angle @xmath30 increases the whole @xmath35 curve shifts to higher temperatures and becomes narrower .",
    "the onset of irreversibility , @xmath33 , is defined by the criterion @xmath40 in the units of fig .",
    "[ rawdata ] .",
    "[ refref ] exhibits typical @xmath0 data for the unirradiated sample _ ref _ , measured at two values of the external field : @xmath41 and @xmath37 .",
    "both curves exhibit a shallow minimum around @xmath42 and they reach their maximum values for @xmath8 along the @xmath43 plane , at angles @xmath44 .",
    "we also measured the frequency dependence of @xmath7 for the same values of magnetic field .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ reffr ] , the slope @xmath45 is larger for larger field .    the sample irradiated along",
    "the @xmath20axis exhibits additional feature - a _ peak _ around _  _ @xmath42 .",
    "this is clearly shown in fig .",
    "[ refuir ] where we compare @xmath0 at @xmath46 for the samples _ ref _ and _ uir_. as discussed below , this peak is a signature of the unidirectional magnetic anisotropy induced by the columnar defects .",
    "intuitively , one would therefore expect two peaks , along @xmath47 , for the third sample , _ cir _ , crossed - irradiated at @xmath47 .",
    "instead , we find one strong peak around @xmath42 , similar to that found in bscco crystals @xcite .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ refcir ] where we compare @xmath0 at @xmath48 for this sample ( _ cir _ ) and for the unirradiated sample ( _ ref _ ) .",
    "we argue below that the peak around @xmath49 is a result of a collective action of the crossed columnar defects , and its origin is the same as that for unidirectional enhancement of critical current density observed in _ bscco",
    "_ crystals @xcite .",
    "the  true  irreversibility temperature @xmath50 is defined as a temperature above which the pinning vanishes .",
    "such disappearance of pinning can be of static ( true phase transition ) , as well as of dynamic origin ( gradual freezing , pinning in liquid ) . in practice",
    ", one determines the irreversibility temperature @xmath51 as the temperature above which the critical current density is less than some threshold value @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , by definition , @xmath53 .",
    "the apparent current depends on temperature @xmath36 , magnetic field @xmath54 and the frequency @xmath55 of the exciting field which defines a characteristic time - scale @xmath56 for the experiment . by solving the equation @xmath57 with respect to @xmath36 one finds the experimental irreversibility temperature @xmath7 for constant @xmath54 and @xmath55 . in the following",
    "we argue that in our experiments the measured @xmath7 is a good approximation of @xmath50 .",
    "in order to estimate @xmath7 we employ a general form for the apparent current density _ in the vicinity of the irreversibility line _ ( irl ) @xcite : @xmath58 where the parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 are temperature independent ( eq . [ j ]",
    "is thus valid only in a narrow temperature interval near the irl and for fields larger than @xmath61 ) . from eq .",
    "[ j ] we get : @xmath62 inserting reasonable numerical estimates : @xmath63 , @xmath64 for our experimental resolution , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 @xcite , @xmath68 @xcite , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 @xcite , we get from eq .",
    "[ tirr ] : @xmath71 .",
    "thus , with @xmath72 accuracy we may say that @xmath7 , the measured onset of the third harmonic component in the @xmath6 response , marks some  true ",
    "irreversibility crossover line @xmath73 .",
    "the nature of this line @xmath74 is our main interest , since , as discussed in the introduction , it is directly related to the pinning properties of vortex lattice in type - ii superconductors at high temperatures .",
    "we turn now to consider the effect of the intrinsic anisotropy on @xmath33 . following the anisotropic scaling approach proposed by blatter et al.@xcite",
    ", we replace @xmath36 by @xmath75 and @xmath54 by @xmath76 , where @xmath77 and @xmath78 is the anisotropy parameter for @xmath9 .",
    "it should be emphasized that we can use this scheme only in the case of _ intrinsic _ anisotropy @xmath79 , where @xmath80 and @xmath81 denote the effective masses of the electron along the @xmath20axis and in the @xmath82 plane , respectively . in the case of some _ extrinsic _ magnetic anisotropy , ( columnar defects or twin planes )",
    ", the critical current depends on the angle not only via the effective magnetic field @xmath83 , but also because of this extrinsic anisotropy .    as we have already indicated in the introduction , there are several possible origins for a crossover from irreversible to reversible magnetic behavior in unirradiated samples .",
    "we exclude the vortex - glass to vortex fluid transition as a possible origin for the irl , because this transition was shown to occur at temperatures lower than the onset of dissipation @xcite .",
    "the thermal depinning temperature _ increases _ with increase of field @xcite @xmath84 and , therefore is excluded as well .",
    "vortex - lattice melting transition is believed to be responsible for the appearance of reversibility @xcite .",
    "the explicit angular dependence of @xmath85 was derived by blatter et al .",
    "using their scaling approach : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the flux quantum , @xmath88 is the coherence length , @xmath89 is a numerical factor , estimated in @xcite , @xmath90 is the lindemann number , @xmath91 is the ginzburg number , and @xmath92 is the _ linear _ extrapolation of the upper critical field from @xmath93 to zero . solving eq .",
    "[ tm0 ] with respect to @xmath85 we get : @xmath94    eq . [ tm ] predicts that the melting temperature decreases as @xmath95 increases .",
    "this is due to the fact that the inter - vortex distance @xmath96 decreases faster than the characteristic amplitude of fluctuations @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , the condition for the vortex - lattice melting @xmath98 implies larger melting temperatures for smaller effective fields , i. e. , for larger angles . in agreement with this prediction , the experimental data of fig .",
    "[ refref ] show that @xmath99 increases with the angle .",
    "i.e. , decreases with @xmath83 .",
    "the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ refref ] are fits to equation [ tm ] . from this fit",
    "we get @xmath100 . however , a reasonable estimate of @xmath101 yields @xmath102 , where we take @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "also , yeh et al .",
    "showed that the onset of irreversibility occurs above the melting temperature ( ref.@xcite , fig .",
    "4 ) . in addition ,",
    "the important effect of the frequency ( see fig . [ reffr ] ) is not included in eq .",
    "[ tm ] .",
    "we discuss now another possibility for the onset of the irreversibility , namely , pinning in the vortex liquid ( for a discussion see ch .",
    "vi in blatter et al .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "any fluctuation in the vortex structure in the liquid state has to be averaged over the characteristic time scale for pinning @xmath107 . in the absence of viscosity",
    "the only fluctuations in the liquid state are thermal fluctuations , which have a characteristic time @xmath108 .",
    "( as shown in @xcite @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the depairing current ) .",
    "thus , such a liquid is always unpinned .",
    "the situation is different for a liquid with finite viscosity . in this case",
    "there exists another type of excitations in the vortex structure , i.e. _ plastic _ deformations with a characteristic time scale @xmath111 .",
    "the energy barrier , corresponding to plastic deformation is shown to be @xcite : @xmath112 where @xmath113 is a coefficient of the order of unity .",
    "the corresponding characteristic time scale is : @xmath114 thus , depending on the viscosity , @xmath111 can be smaller or larger than @xmath115 . in the latter case , after averaging over a time @xmath107 , the vortex structure remains distorted and such a liquid shows irreversible magnetic behavior .",
    "thus , on the time scale of @xmath107 the distorted vortex structure is pinned .",
    "the crossover between pinned and unpinned liquid occurs at temperature @xmath116 where the characteristic relaxation time for pinning @xmath117 becomes comparable to that for plastic motion @xmath118 .",
    "thus , using eqs .",
    "[ upl ] and [ tpl ] we obtain : @xmath119 finally , using the anisotropic scaling @xcite we may rewrite eq .",

    "this is in agreement with the value found from the fit ( solid line in fig .",
    "[ refref ] ) for @xmath103 , @xmath105 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 .    to further confirm that in our @xmath9 films the most probable physical mechanism for the onset of irreversibility is a dynamic crossover from unpinned to pinned vortex liquid we discuss now the frequency dependence of @xmath99 .",
    "equation [ tk ] has a clear prediction for the frequency dependence of @xmath7 . to see it",
    "directly we may simplify it by using the experimentally determined smallness of value of the fit parameter @xmath128 , which allows to expand eq .",
    "[ tk ] ( for not too large fields ) as @xmath129 which results in a linear dependence of @xmath7 upon @xmath130 and a slope @xmath131 .",
    "note that the slope is proportional to @xmath132 .",
    "this is indeed confirmed by the experimental data , as is demonstrated by the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ reffr ] . from this fit",
    "we get @xmath133 and we can independently verify the parameter @xmath134 appeared in eq .",
    "[ tk ] @xmath135 , which is in an agreement with the value obtained above .",
    "we note that the approximated expression for the frequency dependence of @xmath99 , eq .",
    "[ tks ] , is valid in the whole experimentally accessible range of magnetic field since eq .",
    "[ tk ] predicts a maximum in the slope @xmath136 at @xmath137 @xmath138 for the experimental parameters .",
    "this value is , of course , beyond the experimental limits and , probably , even exceeds @xmath139 .",
    "another support for the onset of the irreversibility in a vortex liquid is the @xmath140 field amplitude dependence of the irl . in both , thermal - activated",
    "( taff ) and pure flux - flow ( ff ) regimes the i - v curves are linear and the onset of the third harmonic is due to a change in the slope ( from @xmath141 to @xmath142 ) . in this case",
    "we expect the amplitude dependence for this onset .",
    "contrary , at the melting transition the onset of irreversibility is sharp and is not expected to depend upon the amplitute of the @xmath6 field . in our experiments",
    "we find a pronounced amplitude dependence of the irl , thus confirming the above scenario .",
    "for the irradiated films the situation is quite different . the models for @xmath33 in unirradiated films can not explain the experimental features exhibited in figs .",
    "[ refuir ] and [ refcir ] , in particular the increase in @xmath7 in the vicinity of @xmath42 .",
    "such discrepancy can only be due to the angular anisotropy introduced by columnar defects , i.e. , the angle - dependent pinning strength .",
    "it was shown , both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite , that for magnetic field oriented along the defects the irreversibility line is shifted upward with respect to the unirradiated system .",
    "thus , our results in fig .",
    "[ refuir ] suggest that the measured @xmath0 is a superposition of the angular variation of @xmath7 in unirradiated film ( denoted in this section as @xmath143 ) and the anisotropic enhancement of the pinning strength due to irradiation .",
    "we can estimate the latter contribution by employing the concept of a  trapping angle ",
    "@xmath144 , the angle between the external field and the defects at which vortices start to be partially trapped by columnar tracks .",
    "( for a schematic description , see fig .",
    "@xmath145 in blatter et al .",
    "@xcite ) . as we show in appendix a , @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the trapping potential of a columnar defect and @xmath148 is the line tension . in the experiment we cool down at a fixed @xmath30 , and the onset of irreversibility must occur when @xmath149 , provided that the temperature is still larger than @xmath150 .",
    "otherwise , the onset occurs at @xmath143 .",
    "this defines the condition for the irreversibility temperature @xmath7 for angles @xmath151 in our case : @xmath152 at high - temperatures @xmath153 , where @xmath154 is the depinning energy @xcite .",
    "thus , we can write for @xmath7 : @xmath155 where @xmath156 and @xmath157 are constants .",
    "this expression is in an agreement with our results shown in fig .",
    "[ refuir ] ( solid line ) .",
    "we note , however , some discrepancy in the vicinity of @xmath42 , where we find quite weak dependence of @xmath7 on angle .",
    "we explain this deviation by considering the influence of relaxation , which , in the case of parallel defects depends on angle .",
    "the relaxation rate is maximal , when vortices are aligned along the defects and retains its normal  background  value for perpendicular direction @xcite .",
    "vortex , captured by a defect , can nucleate a double kink which slides out resulting in a displacement of a vortex on a neighboring column . in our irradiated samples",
    "the defect lattice is very dense ( the matching field @xmath158 , i.e. , distance between columns @xmath159 ) and such double - kink nucleation an easy process .",
    "thus , the irreversibility temperature should be shifted down around @xmath42 as compared to the  ideal  , non - relaxed value , eq . [ tirrcd ] .",
    "this explains the reduction in @xmath7 in fig .",
    "[ refuir ] .",
    "we may now conclude that in irradiated films , for angles less than the critical angle @xmath160 , the irreversibility line is determined by the * trapping angle * @xmath144*. * the bose - glass transition can probably only be found for small angles within the lock - in angle @xmath161 .",
    "this conclusion is also indirectly confirmed in @xcite .    as was pointed out in the introduction , crossed defects should hinder the relaxation due to forced entanglement of vortices .",
    "thus , the irreversibility temperature is expected to be closer to that predicted by eq .",
    "[ tirrcd ] .",
    "[ refcir ] shows a good agreement of the experimental data with eq .",
    "[ tirrcd ] ( solid line ) . to explain why defects crossed at large angle act collectively and force unidirectional magnetic anisotropy , we follow here the approach outlined in @xcite , and extend that description to account for arbitrary orientation of the external field with respect to the crossed columnar defects and to the @xmath20axis . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors consider possible motion of vortices in a ",
    "forest  of crossed defects for field oriented along the @xmath20axis . in our case of a dense lattice",
    "we may exclude from consideration free kink sliding and consider only depinning from the intersections .",
    "we sketch in fig .",
    "[ forest ] the two limiting situations : @xmath162 the external field is parallel to one subsystem of the columnar defects @xmath163 and @xmath164 the external field is oriented along the @xmath20axis , between crossed columns @xmath165 . in case @xmath162 , fig .",
    "[ forest]a , vortices can depin just by nucleation the single kinks which are sliding from intersection to intersection , or , by nucleation of super - kinks resulting in a kind of motion , similar to a variable - range hopping .",
    "this type of thermally assisted vortex depinning does not cost any additional energy on vortex bending .",
    "another situation arises for field along the @xmath20axis , fig .",
    "[ forest]b .",
    "now vortices can depin _ only _ via nucleation of multiple half - loops , which characteristic size depends upon current density .",
    "this results in additional barrier for vortex depinning , which even diverges at zero current @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the relaxation rate is anisotropic , i.e , it is suppressed when the external field is oriented along the mid direction between the two subsystems of the crossed columnar defects .",
    "this is just opposite to a situation in uniformly irradiated samples .",
    "we presented angle - resolved measurements of the irreversibility temperature in unirradiated @xmath1 film and in two films with columnar defects , induced by @xmath166 pb - ions irradiation , either parallel to the @xmath20axis or crossed in @xmath21 .",

    "are given .",
    "we also discuss the possible influence of anisotropic enhancement in relaxation rate which leads to a smearing of the expected cusp at @xmath168 in the @xmath0 curve in the uniformly irradiated film .",
