    "in wireless networks with selfish nodes such as ad hoc networks , the nodes may not be willing to fully cooperate to accomplish the overall network goals . specifically for the packet - forwarding problem , forwarding of other nodes packets",
    "consumes a node s limited battery energy .",
    "therefore , it may not be in a node s best interest to forward other s arriving packets .",
    "however , refusal to forward other s packets non - cooperatively will severely affect the network functionality and thereby impair a node s own performance .",
    "hence , it is crucial to design a mechanism to enforce cooperation for packet forwarding among greedy and distributed nodes .",
    "the packet - forwarding problem in ad hoc networks has been extensively studied in the literature .",
    "the fact that nodes act selfishly to optimize their own performance has motivated many researchers to apply game theory @xcite in solving this problem .",
    "broadly speaking , the approaches used to encourage packet - forwarding can be categorized into two general types .",
    "the first type makes use of virtual payments . pricing @xcite and credit based method @xcite",
    "fall into this first type .",
    "the second type of approach is related to personal and community enforcement to maintain the long - term relationship among nodes .",
    "cooperation is sustained because defection against one node causes personal retaliation or sanction by others .",
    "_ watchdog _ and _ pathrater _ are proposed in @xcite to identify misbehaving nodes and deflect traffic around them .",

    ", a cartel maintenance framework is constructed for distributed rate control for wireless networks . in @xcite ,",
    "self - learning repeated game approaches are constructed to enforce cooperation and to study better cooperation .",
    "some recent works for game theory to enhance energy - efficient behavior in infrastructure networks can be found in @xcite .",
    "however , for packet - forwarding networks , there exists the so - called _ curse of boundary nodes_. the nodes at the boundary of the network must depend on the backbone nodes in the middle of the networks to forward their packets . on the other hand , the backbone nodes will not depend on the boundary nodes . as a result",
    ", the backbone nodes do not worry about retaliation or lost reputation for not forwarding the packets of the boundary nodes .",
    "this fact causes the curse of the boundary nodes . in order to cure this curse , in this paper",
    ", we propose an approach based on cooperative game coalitions using cooperative transmission .",
    "recently , cooperative transmission @xcite @xcite has gained considerable attention as a transmit strategy for future wireless networks .",
    "the basic idea of cooperative transmission is that the relay nodes can help the source node s transmission by relaying a replica of the source s information .",
    "cooperative communications efficiently takes advantage of the broadcast nature of wireless networks , while exploiting the inherent spatial and multiuser diversities . the energy - efficient broadcast problem in wireless networks",
    "is considered in @xcite .",
    "the work in @xcite evaluates the cooperative diversity performance when the best relay is chosen according to the average snr , and the outage probability of relay selection based on instantaneous snrs . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors propose a distributed relay selection scheme that requires limited network knowledge with instantaneous snrs . in @xcite , the relay assignment problem",
    "is solved for multiuser cooperative communications . in @xcite , cooperative resource allocation for ofdm is studied .",
    "a game theoretic approach for relay selection has been proposed in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the centralized power allocation schemes are presented by assuming all the relay nodes helped . in @xcite ,",
    "cooperative routing protocols are constructed based on non - cooperative routes .    using cooperative transmission",
    ", boundary nodes can serve as relays and provide some transmission benefits for the backbone nodes that can be viewed as source nodes . in return ,",
    "the boundary nodes are rewarded for packet - forwarding . to analyze the benefits and rewards ,",
    "we investigate a game coalition that describes how much collective payoff a set of nodes can gain and how to divide the payoff .",
    "we investigate the stability and payoff division using concepts such as the core , nucleolus , and shapley function .",
    "two types of fairness are defined , namely , the min - max fairness using nucleolus and average fairness using the shapley function .",
    "then , we construct a protocol using both repeated games and coalition games . from the simulation results ,",
    "we investigate how boundary nodes and backbone nodes form coalitions according to different fairness criteria .",
    "the proposed protocol can improve the network connectivity by about 50% , compared to the pure repeated game approach .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : model ] , repeated game approaches are reviewed and the curse of the boundary nodes is explained . in section [ sec :",
    "protocol ] , the cooperative transmission model is illustrated and the corresponding coalition games are constructed .",
    "stability and two types of fairness are investigated .",
    "a protocol that exploits the properties of our approach is also proposed .",
    "simulation results are shown in section [ sec : simulation ] and conclusions are given in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "a wireless packet - forwarding network can be modeled as a directed graph @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the set of all nodes and @xmath2 is the set of all directed links @xmath3 .",
    "each node @xmath4 has several transmission destinations which are included in set @xmath5 . to reach the destination @xmath6 in @xmath5 ,",
    "the available routes form a _ depending graph _",
    "@xmath7 whose nodes represents the potential packet - forwarding nodes .",
    "the transmission from node @xmath4 to node @xmath6 depends on a subsect of the nodes in @xmath7 for packet - forwarding .",
    "notice that this dependency can be mutual .",
    "one node depends on the other node , while the other node can depend on this node as well . in general , this mutual dependency is common , especially for backbone nodes at the center of the network . in the remainder of this section , we will discuss how to make use of this mutual dependency for packet - forwarding using a repeated game , and then we will explain the curse of boundary nodes .",
    "a repeated game is a special type of dynamic game ( a game that is played multiple times ) .",
    "when the nodes interact by playing a similar static game ( which is played only once ) numerous times , the game is called a repeated game . unlike a static game ,",
    "a repeated game allows a strategy to be contingent on the past moves , thus allowing reputation effects and retribution , which give possibilities for cooperation .",
    "the game is defined as follows :    a @xmath8-period _ repeated game _ is a dynamic game in which , at each period @xmath9 , the moves during periods @xmath10 are known to every node . in such a game , the total discounted payoff for each node is computed by @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the payoff to node @xmath4 at period @xmath9 and where @xmath13 is a discount factor . note that @xmath13 represents the node s patience or on the other hand how important the past affects the current payoff .",
    "if @xmath14 , the game is referred as an infinitely - repeated game .",
    "the average payoff to node @xmath4 is then given by : @xmath15    it is known that repeated games can be used to induce greedy nodes in communication networks to show cooperation . in packet - forwarding networks , if a greedy node does not forward the packets of other nodes , it can enjoy benefits such as power saving .",
    "however , this node will get punishment from the other nodes in the future if it depends on the other nodes to forward its own packets .",
    "the benefit of greediness in the short term will be offset by the loss associated with punishment in the future .",
    "so the nodes will rather act cooperatively if the nodes are sufficiently patient . from the folk theorem",
    "below , we infer that in an infinitely repeated game , any feasible outcome that gives each node a better payoff than the nash equilibrium @xcite can be obtained .",
    "( _ folk theorem _",
    "@xcite ) let ( @xmath16 ) be the set of payoffs from a nash equilibrium and let ( @xmath17 ) be any feasible set of payoffs .",
    "there exists an equilibrium of the infinitely repeated game that attains any feasible solution ( @xmath17 ) with @xmath18 as the average payoff , provided that @xmath13 is sufficiently close to 1 .    in the literature of packet - forwarding wireless networks ,",
    "the conclusion of the above folk theorem is achieved by several approaches .",
    "tit - for - tat @xcite @xcite is proposed so that all mutually dependent nodes have the same set of actions .",
    "a cartel maintenance scheme @xcite has closed - form optimal solutions for both cooperation and non - cooperation .",
    "a self - learning repeated game approach is proposed in @xcite for individual distributed nodes to study the cooperation points and to develop protocols for maintaining them .",
    "given the previous attention to the problem of nodes having mutual dependency , we will assume in this paper that the packet - forwarding problem of selfish nodes with mutual dependency has been solved and we will focus instead on the problems encountered by the boundary nodes .",
    "when there is no mutual dependency , the curse of boundary nodes occurs , an example of which is shown in figure [ example ] .",
    "suppose node @xmath19 needs to send data to node @xmath20 and node @xmath21 needs to send data to node @xmath22 .",
    "because node @xmath19 and node @xmath21 depend on each other for packet - forwarding , they are obliged to do so because of the possible threat or retaliation from the other node .",
    "however , if node @xmath22 wants to transmit to node @xmath21 and node @xmath23 , or node @xmath23 tries to communicate with node @xmath22 and node @xmath19 , the nodes in the middle have no incentive to forward the packets due to their greediness .",
    "moreover , this greediness can not be punished in the future since the dependency is not mutual .",
    "this problem is especially severe for the nodes on the boundary of the networks , so it is called _ the curse of boundary nodes_.    on the other hand , if node @xmath22 can form a coalition with node @xmath19 and help node @xmath19 s transmission ( for example to reduce the transmitted power of node @xmath19 ) , then node @xmath19 has the incentive to help node @xmath22 transmit as a reward .",
    "a similar situation arises for node @xmath23 to form a coalition with node @xmath21 .",
    "we call nodes like @xmath19 and @xmath21 _ backbone nodes _ , while nodes like @xmath22 and @xmath23 are _ boundary nodes_. in the following section , we will study how coalitions can be formed to address this issue using cooperative transmission .",
    "in this section , we first study a cooperative transmission technique that allows nodes to participate in coalitions . then",
    ", we formulate a coalition game with cooperative transmission .",
    "furthermore , we investigate the fairness issue and propose two types of fairness definitions . finally , a protocol for packet - forwarding using repeated games and coalition games is constructed .",
    "first , we discuss the traditional direct transmission case .",
    "the source transmits its information to the destination with power @xmath24 .",
    "the received signal to noise ratio ( snr ) is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the channel gain from the source to the destination and @xmath27 is the noise level . to achieve the minimal link quality @xmath28 , we need for the transmitted power to be sufficiently large so that @xmath29 .",
    "the transmitted power is also upper bounded by @xmath30 .",
    "next , we consider multiple nodes using the amplify - and - forward protocol @xcite to transmit in two stages as shown in figure [ example_ct ] . in stage one , the source node ( denoted as node @xmath22 ) transmits its information to the destination , and due to the broadcast nature of the wireless channels , the other nodes can receive the information . in stage two ,",
    "the remaining @xmath31 relay nodes help the source by amplifying the source signal . in both stages , the source and the relays transmit their signals through orthogonal channels using schemes like tdma , fdma , or orthogonal cdma .    in stage one",
    ", the source transmits its information and the received signals at the destination and the relays can be written respectively as @xmath32 @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the transmitted power of the source , @xmath35 is the transmitted symbol with unit power , @xmath36 is the channel gain from the source to relay @xmath4 , and @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the thermal noise processes at the destination and relay , respectively . without significant loss of generality , we assume that all thermal noises have the same power @xmath39 .    in stage two , each relay amplifies the received signal from the source and retransmits it to the destination .",
    "the received signal at the destination for relay @xmath4 can be written as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is relay @xmath4 s transmit power , @xmath42 is the channel gain from relay @xmath4 to the destination , and @xmath43 is the thermal noise with variance @xmath39 .    at the destination ,",
    "the signal received at stage one and the @xmath31 signals received at stage two are combined using maximal ratio combining ( mrc ) .",
    "the snr at the output of mrc is @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46    on comparing ( [ snr_coop ] ) with ( [ snr_direct ] ) , in order to achieve the desired link quality @xmath28 , we can see that the required power is always less than the direct transmission power , i.e. , @xmath47 .",
    "so cooperation transmission can reduce the transmit power of the source node .",
    "this fact can give incentives of mutual benefits for the backbone nodes ( acting as sources ) and the boundary nodes ( acting as relays ) , and consequently can cure the curse of the boundary nodes mentioned in section [ curse ] .",
    "in this subsection , we study possible coalitions between the boundary nodes and the backbone nodes , for situations in which the boundary nodes can help relay the information of the backbone nodes using cooperative transmission . in the following ,",
    "we first define some basic concepts that will be needed in our analysis .    a _ coalition _",
    "@xmath48 is defined to be a subset of the total set of nodes @xmath49 .",
    "the nodes in a coalition want to cooperate with each other .",
    "the _ coalition form _ of a game is given by the pair @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is a real - valued function , called the _",
    "characteristic function_. @xmath52 is the value of the cooperation for coalition @xmath48 with the following properties :    1 .",
    "super - additivity : if @xmath48 and @xmath54 are disjoint coalitions ( @xmath55 ) , then @xmath56 .",
    "the coalition states the benefit obtained from cooperation agreements .",
    "but we still need to examine whether or not the nodes are willing to participate in the coalition .",
    "a coalition is called _ stable _ if no other coalition will have the incentive and power to upset the cooperative agreement .",
    "such division of @xmath51 is called a point in the _ core _ , which is defined by the following definitions .",
    "a payoff vector @xmath57 is said to be _ group rational _ or _ efficient _ if @xmath58 .",
    "a payoff vector @xmath59 is said to be _ individually rational _ if the node can obtain the benefit no less than acting alone , i.e. @xmath60 .",
    "an _ imputation _ is a payoff vector satisfying the above two conditions .",
    "an imputation @xmath59 is said to be unstable through a coalition @xmath48 if @xmath61 , i.e. , the nodes have incentive for coalition @xmath48 and upset the proposed @xmath59 . the set @xmath62 of a stable imputation is called the _ core _ , i.e. , @xmath63    in the economics literature , the core gives a reasonable set of possible shares .",
    "a combination of shares is in the core if there is no sub - coalition in which its members may gain a higher total outcome than the combination of shares of concern .",
    "if a share is not in the core , some members may be frustrated and may think of leaving the whole group with some other members and form a smaller group .    in the packet - forwarding network as shown in figure",
    "[ example_ct ] , we first assume one backbone node to be the source node ( node @xmath22 ) and the nearby boundary nodes ( node @xmath19 to node @xmath31 ) to be the relay nodes . we will discuss the case of multiple source nodes later .",
    "if no cooperative transmission is employed , the utilities for the source node and the relay nodes are @xmath64 with cooperative transmission and a grand coalition that includes all nodes , the utilities for the source node and the relay nodes are @xmath65 @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the ratio of the number of packets that the backbone node is willing to forward for boundary node @xmath4 , to the number of packets that the boundary node @xmath4 relays for the backbone node using cooperative transmission . here",
    "we use negative power as the utility so as to be consistent with the conventions used in the game theory literature .",
    "smaller @xmath67 means the boundary nodes have to relay more packets before realizing the rewards of packet forwarding .",
    "the other interpretation of the utility is as the average power per transmission for the boundary nodes .",
    "the following theorem gives conditions under which the core is not empty , i.e , in which the grand coalition is stable .",
    "the core is not empty if @xmath68 , and @xmath67 are such that @xmath69 , i.e , @xmath70    first , any relay node will get @xmath71 utility if it leaves the coalition with the source node , so no node has incentive to leave coalition with node @xmath22 .",
    "then , from ( [ snr_coop ] ) , the inclusion of relay nodes will increase the received snr monotonically .",
    "so @xmath34 will decrease monotonically with the addition of any relay node . as a result ,",
    "the source node has the incentive to include all the relay nodes , as long as the source power can be reduced , i.e. , @xmath69 .",
    "a grand coalition is formed and the core is not empty if ( [ condition_core ] ) holds .",
    "the concept of the core defines the stability of a utility allocation .",
    "however , it does not define how to allocate the utility . for the proposed game ,",
    "each relay node can obtain different utilities by using different values of @xmath67 . in the next two subsections ,",
    "we study how to achieve min - max fairness and average fairness .",
    "we introduce the concepts of _ excess _ , _ kernel _ , and _ nucleolus_@xcite . for a fixed characteristic function @xmath51 , an imputation @xmath59",
    "is found such that , for each coalition @xmath48 and its associated dissatisfaction , an optimal imputation is calculated to minimize the maximum dissatisfaction .",
    "the dissatisfaction is quantified as follows .",
    "the measure of dissatisfaction of an imputation @xmath59 for a coalition @xmath48 is defined as the _ excess _ : @xmath72    obviously , any imputation @xmath59 is in the core , if and only if all its excesses are negative or zero .",
    "a _ kernel _ of @xmath51 is the set of all allocations @xmath59 such that @xmath73 if nodes @xmath4 and @xmath6 are in the same coalition , then the highest excess that @xmath4 can make in a coalition without @xmath6 is equal to the highest excess that @xmath6 can make in a coalition without @xmath4 .",
    "the _ nucleolus _ of a game is the allocation @xmath59 that minimizes the maximum excess : @xmath74    the nucleolus of a game has the following property : the nucleolus of a game in coalitional form exists and is unique .",
    "the nucleolus is group rational and individually rational . if the core is not empty , the nucleolus is in the core and kernel . in other word ,",
    "the nucleolus is the best allocation under the min - max criterion .    using the above concepts , we prove the following theorem to show the optimal @xmath67 in ( [ alpha ] ) to have min - max fairness .",
    "the maximal @xmath67 to yield the nucleolus of the proposed coalition game is given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the required transmitted power of the source when all relays transmit with transmitted power @xmath30 .",
    "since for any coalition other than the grand coalition , the excess will be @xmath71 , we need only consider the grand coalition .",
    "suppose the min - max utility is @xmath77 for all nodes , i.e. @xmath78 from ( [ condition_core ] ) and since @xmath79 is monotonically increasing with @xmath67 in ( [ ui ] ) , we have @xmath80 since @xmath34 in ( [ snr_coop ] ) is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath41 , to achieve the maximal @xmath67 and @xmath77 , each relay transmits with the largest possible power @xmath30 .",
    "notice here we assume the backbone node can accept arbitrarily small power gain to join the coalition .",
    "the core concept defines the stability of an allocation of payoff and the nucleolus concept quantifies the min - max fairness of a game coalition . in this subsection",
    ", we study another average measure of fairness for each individual using the concept of a shapley function @xcite .    a _ shapley function _",
    "@xmath81 is a function that assigns to each possible characteristic function @xmath51 a vector of real numbers , i.e. , @xmath82 where @xmath83 represents the worth or value of node @xmath4 in the game .",
    "there are four shapley axioms that @xmath84 must satisfy    1 .",
    "_ efficiency axiom _ : @xmath85 .",
    "symmetry axiom _ : if node @xmath4 and node @xmath6 are such that @xmath86 for every coalition @xmath48 not containing node @xmath4 and node @xmath6 , then @xmath87 .",
    "dummy axiom _ : if node @xmath4 is such that @xmath88 for every coalition @xmath48 not containing @xmath4 , then @xmath89 .",
    "_ additivity axiom _ : if @xmath90 and @xmath51 are characteristic functions , then @xmath91 .",
    "it can be proved that there exists a unique function @xmath81 satisfying the shapley axioms .",
    "moreover , the shapley function can be calculated as @xmath92.\\ ] ] here @xmath93 denotes the size of set @xmath48 and @xmath94 .",
    "the physical meaning of the shapley function can be interpreted as follows .",
    "suppose one backbone node plus @xmath31 boundary nodes form a coalition .",
    "each node joins the coalition in random order .",
    "so there are @xmath95 different ways that the nodes might be ordered in joining the coalition . for any set @xmath48 that does not contain node @xmath4",
    ", there are @xmath96 different ways to order the nodes so that @xmath48 is the set of nodes who enter the coalition before node @xmath4 .",
    "thus , if the various orderings are equally likely , @xmath97 is the probability that , when node @xmath4 enters the coalition , the coalition of @xmath48 is already formed .",
    "when node @xmath4 finds @xmath48 ahead of it as it joins the coalition , then its marginal contribution to the worth of the coalition is @xmath98 .",
    "thus , under the assumption of randomly - ordered joining , the shapley function of each node is its expected marginal contribution when it joins the coalition .    in our specific case",
    ", we consider the case in which the backbone node is always in the coalition , and the boundary nodes randomly join the coalition .",
    "we have @xmath99 and @xmath100 which is the overall power saving .",

    "we can see that when boundary node @xmath21 is closer to the backbone node than boundary node @xmath19 , @xmath128 , i.e. , boundary node @xmath21 can help relay fewer packets for backbone node @xmath19 before being rewarded .",
    "the two curves for @xmath129 and @xmath130 for the same boundary node @xmath19 location cross at the boundary node @xmath19 location .",
    "the figure shows that the average fairness using the shapley function gives greater rewards to the boundary node whose channel is better and who can help the backbone node more . when boundary node @xmath21 moves from @xmath126 to @xmath116 , @xmath129 becomes smaller , but @xmath130 becomes larger .",
    "this is because the backbone node must depend on boundary node @xmath21 more for relaying .",
    "however , the backbone node will pay less for the boundary nodes .",
    "notice that @xmath67 at the crossover point is lower .",
    "this is because the overall power for the backbone node is high when boundary node @xmath21 is far away , as shown in figure [ p0_r ] .",
    "finally , we examine the degree to which the coalition game can improve the network connectivity . here",
    "we define the network connectivity as the probability that a randomly located node can connect to the other nodes .",
    "all nodes are randomly located within a square of size @xmath131 . in figure",
    "[ prob_size ] , we show the network un - connectivity as a function of @xmath132 for the numbers of nodes equal to @xmath120 and @xmath133 . with increasing network size , the node density becomes lower , and more and more nodes are located at the boundary and must depend on the others for packet - forwarding .",
    "if no coalition game is formed , these boundary nodes can not transmit their packets due to the selfishness of the other nodes . with the coalition game",
    ", the network connectivity can be improved by about 50% . the only chance that a node can not connect to the other nodes",
    "is when this node is located too far away from any other node .",
    "we can see that the game coalition cures the curse of the boundary nodes in wireless packet - forwarding networks with selfish nodes .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed a coalition game approach to provide benefits to selfish nodes in wireless packet - forwarding networks using cooperative transmission , so that the boundary nodes can transmit their packets effectively .",
    "we have used the concepts of coalition games to maintain stable and fair game coalitions .",
    "specifically , we have studied two fairness concepts : min - max fairness and average fairness .",
    "a protocol has been constructed using repeated games and coalition games . from simulation results ,",
    "we have seen how boundary nodes and backbone nodes form coalitions according to different fairness criteria .",
    "we can also see that network connectivity can be improved by about 50% , compared to the pure repeated game approach .",
