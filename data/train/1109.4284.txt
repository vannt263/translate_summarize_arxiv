    "the reported values for measurements on powders are usually smaller due to the presence of hydrophilic sites on the edges of finite clay particles  @xcite . to the best of our knowledge , no experimental contact angles have been reported for fluorotalc . for both talc and pyrophyllite , the contact angles obtained from our simulations ( @xmath20 and @xmath22 respectively ) are somewhat larger than the experimental estimates , suggesting that surfaces modeled with the clayff model are too hydrophobic .",
    "nevertheless , amongst various commonly used clay force fields  @xcite , we find that the correspondence with experiments is closest for clayff .",
    "a comparison of these force fields with experiments is provided in the supplementary information .",

    "i.e. _ the width of the pmf well in  [ fig : pmf](c ) , and @xmath34 is the thermal energy .    in the very low rh limit",
    ", corresponding to single water adsorption , we can safely assume that water molecules do not interact with each other .",

    ", we get an experimental estimate of @xmath39  kcal / mol  @xcite .",
    "this somewhat stronger adsorption than that predicted from simulations using clayff ( -5.9  kcal / mol ) , is consistent with the overestimate of the clayff talc contact angle .",
    "if we further assume that the adsorbed water molecules do not interact with each other even at higher rh , the langmuir model ( with @xmath40 ) predicts that @xmath41 at @xmath42 rh . as water coverage on the talc surface",
    "can be large even at moderate rh , interactions between water molecules may be important , consistent with suggestions that clustering needs to be considered  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for fluorotalc @xmath43 at saturation estimated from @xmath15 is very small ( @xmath44 ) , in agreement with the hydrophobic adsorption behavior reported in figure 10 of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "thus , the clay surfaces simulated using the clayff force field are more hydrophobic than the real clay surfaces used in experiments",
    ". however , the interesting dichotomy of talc surfaces is also observed in the simulations and our findings are qualitatively consistent with the experiments , both at low rh ( strong adsorption for talc and not the other clays ) and at high rh ( large contact angles for all clays ) .",
    "to investigate the disparate behavior of talc surfaces at low and high rh , we compare @xmath16 for moving a water molecule away from the surface under both conditions . at saturation , @xmath16 for the clay surfaces",

    "@xmath16 for fluorotalc is nearly identical to that for pyrophyllite , and that for talc features an additional local minimum around @xmath45    corresponding to water molecules above the binding site .",
    "however , the @xmath16 curves at saturation are qualitatively different from those at low rh [ see [ fig : pmf](c - d ) ] for all three clays , and especially so for talc , the depth of the minimum at saturation is smaller than that at low rh , suggesting a weakening of adhesive interactions at saturation .     for adsorbing a single water molecule on the talc surface , compared to that for a molecule in the dimer and a molecule at saturation . , width=211 ]    to explore the competition between adhesive and cohesive interactions in talc , in [ fig : dimer ] , we compare @xmath16 for an individually adsorbed water , with that for water in a dimer , and that for water at saturation .",
    "as shown in [ fig : dimer ] , the @xmath16 for the dimer displays two minima .",
    "the minimum corresponding to the molecule inside the cavity is shifted to slightly larger values compared to the minimum in the @xmath16 for a single water . in addition , the depth of the minimum is smaller , and is comparable to that for a single water on the more hydrophobic fluorotalc surface [ [ fig : pmf](c ) and [ fig : dimer ] ] . in other words ,",
    "the presence of the second water weakens the adhesive surface - water interactions , which have to compete with the cohesive interactions between the waters .",
    "as the dimer is less tightly bound to the surface than a single water , it is easier for the water to escape the cavity in the presence of a second molecule .",
    "the dimer is in fact more mobile on the talc surface than isolated water molecules ( not shown ) , confirming that the interaction of the surface with the dimer is weaker than with individual molecules",
    ". finally , at saturation , cohesive interactions prevail , and water no longer occupies the binding site cavity as evidenced by the lack of a minimum in @xmath16 for 3  @xmath46  5 .          while the h - bonding between binding sites on the talc surface and water leads to an interesting transition from hydrophilic at low rh to hydrophobic at high rh , the binding sites interact weakly with water in fluorotalc and pyrophyllite , which display hydrophobic behavior for all rh . to investigate the effect of the binding strength on the hydrophobicity of the surface , following giovambattista _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , we construct a series of modified talc surfaces .",
    "the only force field parameters that are changed are the charges on the oxygen ( from @xmath47 to @xmath48 ) and the hydrogen ( from @xmath49 to @xmath50 ) of the hydroxyl group .",
    "we study modified talc surfaces for @xmath51 ranging from -0.425 which corresponds to a non - polar binding site similar to that in fluorotalc , to + 0.6 which corresponds to an ion - pair .",
    "@xmath52 is the talc surface , by definition .    in  [ fig : strength](a ) , we show @xmath16 for an isolated water molecule on the modified talc surfaces .",
    "as the polarity of the -oh bond is increased , the magnitude of @xmath15 also increases , providing us with surfaces that display a wide range of binding strengths .",
    "@xmath16 at saturation , shown in  [ fig : strength](b ) for these surfaces is particularly interesting . for weakly adhesive surfaces ( @xmath53 ) , there is only one stable basin at @xmath54   , corresponding to molecules outside the binding site cavity . for stronger adhesion ( larger @xmath51 ) , a second basin develops at @xmath55    and is separated from the first basin by a barrier .",
    "[ fig : strength](c ) shows the depth of this minimum relative to bulk , @xmath56 , as a function of @xmath15 .",
    "as the surface becomes more adhesive , more waters occupy the binding site and the depth of this minimum increases . when adhesive interactions are large enough to overcome cohesive interactions , _",
    "i.e. _ , when @xmath57 becomes larger than the chemical potential at saturation , @xmath58 ( for @xmath59 ) , every binding site is occupied by a water molecule , resulting in a plateau in @xmath56",
    ".    however , the height @xmath60 of the barrier to escape the cavity , also shown in [ fig : strength](c ) , continues to increase approximately linearly with the binding strength .",
    "thus , for surfaces with strong binding , @xmath60 is large , and the exchange of molecules between the cavities and the liquid is expected to be very slow , with possible consequences on the extent of stick / slip at such surfaces in the presence of a hydrodynamic flow .",
    ", over a wide range of relative humidities ( @xmath61 $ ] ) and adhesive interaction strengths ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "( b ) effect of @xmath15 on surface hydrophobicity quantified by @xmath62 .",
    "the dashed vertical line corresponds to @xmath63 .",
    "snapshots indicating typical configurations of water molecules ( red and white ) on modified talc surfaces ( blue ) are also shown . as the adhesive interactions ( @xmath15 ) overcome the cohesive interactions ( @xmath64 ) ,",
    "there is a transition from a dry surface [ snapshots ( i ) and ( iii ) ] to one covered with a monolayer of water [ snapshots ( ii ) and ( iv ) ] .",
    ", width=331 ]      collectively our results paint a comprehensive picture of how the experimentally measurable quantities , the surface coverage @xmath43 , and the contact angle @xmath65 , respond to changes in relative humidity ( or water chemical potential ) , and on the strength of the adhesive surface - water interactions .",
    "the surface coverage @xmath43 , is defined as the fraction of binding sites occupied by water molecules , and its dependence on rh and @xmath15 is shown schematically in [ fig : bigpicture](a ) .    at low rh ( @xmath66 )",
    ", the competition between the adhesive interactions and the entropy of being in the vapor determines the surface coverage , @xmath43 . at very low rh ,",
    "there are no interactions between adsorbed waters and @xmath43 can be approximated as  : @xmath67 where the second part of the equation is obtained by substituting for @xmath38 using equation ( 1 ) , and using appropriate values of the constants that depend on the surface geometry , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , and those that depend on thermodynamic conditions , @xmath70  and  @xmath71 .    for surfaces with small adhesive interactions , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath72kcal / mol ( or @xmath73 ) , the coverage remains small ( @xmath74 ) even at saturation [ snapshot ( i ) in  [ fig : bigpicture ] ] .",
    "thus , no appreciable interactions between waters are expected over the entire range of rh - values .",
    "both pyrophyllite and fluorotalc fall in this regime .",
    "since @xmath43 increases exponentially with @xmath75 , for values of @xmath76  kcal / mol , there can be substantial coverage even at modest rh [ snapshot ( ii ) in  [ fig : bigpicture ] ] .",
    "equation ( 2 ) is then valid only for small rh - values for which the predicted @xmath43-values are small .",
    "talc lies in this regime .    for larger rh values , there are appreciable interactions between the waters , and it is the competition between adhesive and cohesive interactions that determines surface properties . for surfaces such as talc , for which @xmath77 ,",
    "cohesion prevails at saturation , and the adsorbed waters bead up into a droplet , while the rest of the binding sites on the surface are devoid of waters [ snapshot ( iii ) in  [ fig : bigpicture ] ] .",
    "thus , the interesting crossover from hydrophobic to hydrophilic behavior in talc is a result of its adhesive interactions being strong enough to overcome vapor phase entropy at low rh , but not strong enough to overcome cohesive interactions at saturation . in this regime , with increasing polarity of the binding site , the surface gradually shifts from hydrophobic to hydrophilic , and @xmath62 increases approximately linearly as shown in [ fig : bigpicture](b ) .",
    "finally , for surfaces with even larger values of @xmath57 that are greater than @xmath58 , adhesion dominates . .",
    "surprisingly , water does not fully wet the surface at saturation . instead , all binding sites are occupied by water molecules and only this first layer of water wets the surface .",
    "this water is strongly bound to the surface and the microstructure of the surface dictates the relative positions of the waters . in the present case , the arrangement of waters on the surface is not commensurate with the hydrogen bonding network of water , so that water beads up on the monolayer [ snapshot ( iv ) in  [ fig : bigpicture ] ] . for the modified talc surfaces with @xmath78 , the surface has a strongly adsorbed water monolayer with a droplet on it that makes a contact angle of about @xmath79 .",
    "similar behavior was reported by ohler _",
    "et al . _ for titanium dioxide surfaces , with droplet contact angles of @xmath80 on top of roughly two monolayers of water  @xcite .",
    "however , other simulation studies investigating the effects of surface polarity on hydrophobicity  @xcite , do not observe a plateau with non - zero contact angle at large polarities , seen in our results  [ [ fig : bigpicture](b ) ] .",
    "our modified talc surfaces are different from these previous studies in that the variation in polarity was achieved by changing the charges on atoms in recessed binding sites , while the remaining surface atoms remained the same .",
    "in contrast , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the surface was modified by changing dipoles that protrude from the surface , while leaving the remaining surface atoms unchanged ; whereas in ref .",
    "@xcite , the charges on all atoms in the top two layers of an fcc crystal ( 111 facet ) were changed to tune the polarity . thus , our results indicate that the microstructure of the surface is important in determining the effect of polarity on its wetting properties .",
    "in contrast to the wetting properties of the model fcc surfaces used in ref .",
    "@xcite , experimental measurements indicate that the fcc crystals of platinum ( pt ) , palladium ( pd ) , and gold ( au ) are hydrophobic .",
    "et al . _ observed a hydrophobic water monolayer on both pt(111 ) and pd(111 ) crystals  @xcite .",
    "similarly , water has been shown to bead up on au surfaces  @xcite with a contact angle of @xmath81 and au surfaces have also been shown to adsorb , and facilitate the unfolding of proteins  @xcite ; behavior that is typically associated with hydrophobic surfaces  @xcite .",
    "we speculate that the hydrophobicity of these metal surfaces arises from the presence of a monolayer of water , which binds strongly to the surface in a geometry that inhibits hydrogen bonding to the subsequent liquid water molecules .",
    "our results also have implications on the wetting properties of nanoporous silicates such as hydrophobic zeolites  @xcite and metal - organic frameworks  @xcite .",
    "these hydrophobic pores are thought to be devoid of water at ambient conditions , with water intrusion into the pores occurring only at sufficiently high water pressures .",
    "our results suggest that in the presence of strong binding sites , these nanoporous materials may contain strongly adsorbed water molecules , even at lower pressures .",
    "if the resulting water - covered surface is hydrophobic , no further filling of the pores ( analogous to wetting for planar surfaces ) would be observed at ambient pressures , and intrusion would occur only at higher pressures .",

    "@xmath9 for @xmath85 near the skipper / smith talc surface indicates that it is harder to empty the observation volume close to the surface than in bulk water .",
    "this is also consistent with the observed complete wetting of the talc surface by a droplet , indicating a contact angle of @xmath86 .",
    "such a complete wetting is however in contradiction with the experimental contact angle of @xmath87 .",

    "we nevertheless simulated water droplets on the surface of pyrophyllite using this force field .",
    "the resulting contact angle ( @xmath88 ) was larger than that measured experimentally ( @xmath87 ) , suggesting that this force fields results in surfaces that are too hydrophobic .    finally , while we find that clayff is the best available force field to date , to simulate water at the surface of uncharged clay minerals , the present work suggests that it is too hydrophobic .",
    "thus we find that there is room for improvement to describe the clay - water interaction , in agreement with the findings of a recent study comparing molecular simulations with x - ray and neutron diffraction experiments on a charged smectite  @xcite .",
    "the insights gained during the present study of neutral clays , which are more sensitive to the clay - water interactions , could also be helpful in the design of an improved force field .",
    "such design requires a subtle balance between different interactions which is generally not achieved by tuning only one parameter . with this caveat in mind",
    ", we note that a slightly more polar hydroxyl group might be relevant , as the modified talc surface with @xmath89 seems to agree quite well with experimentally measured @xmath15 and @xmath62 values for talc .",

    "<S> while individual water molecules adsorb strongly on a talc surface ( hydrophilic behavior ) , a droplet of water beads up on the same surface ( hydrophobic behavior ) . to rationalize this dichotomy , we investigate the influence of the microscopic structure of the surface and the strength of adhesive ( surface - water ) interactions on surface hydrophobicity . </S>",
    "<S> we show that at low relative humidity , the competition between adhesion and the favorable entropy of being in the vapor phase determines the surface coverage . however , at saturation , it is the competition between adhesion and cohesion ( water - water interactions ) that determines surface hydrophobicity . </S>",
    "<S> the adhesive interactions in talc are strong enough to overcome the unfavorable entropy , and water adsorbs strongly on talc surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> however , they are too weak to overcome the cohesive interactions , and water thus beads up on talc surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , even ( talc - like ) surfaces that are highly adhesive , do not fully wet at saturation . instead , a water droplet forms on top of a strongly adsorbed monolayer of water . </S>",
    "<S> our results imply that the interior of hydrophobic zeolites suspended in water may contain adsorbed water molecules at pressures much smaller than the intrusion pressure .      </S>",
    "<S> wetting properties of minerals in soils and rocks play a crucial role in the transport , and thus availability , of water and oil . </S>",
    "<S> clay minerals are particularly interesting , not only due to their abundance in nature and in synthetic materials , but also because the existence of clays with different structures allows us to investigate the effect of surface microstructure on macroscopic properties . </S>",
    "<S> clay surfaces can be either charge - neutral or have a net charge , which is balanced by counter - ions in solution . </S>",
    "<S> molecular simulation has furthered our understanding of both these types of clays : uncharged clays have been studied using both ab - initio  @xcite and classical simulations  @xcite , whereas simulations of charged clays have provided insights into interlayer properties  @xcite , swelling  @xcite , and cation exchange  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these studies have shown that the surface microstructure is expected to be more important in determining surface - water interactions in uncharged clays  @xcite , and it is these surfaces that are the focus of the current work . among uncharged clays , </S>",
    "<S> talc surfaces have attracted a lot of attention  @xcite , because of their peculiar behavior with respect to water . </S>",
    "<S> water adsorption at low relative humidity ( rh ) reveals the presence of strong binding sites on talc  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such strong binding sites are absent in other uncharged clays such as pyrophyllite and fluorotalc . yet , </S>",
    "<S> experimental contact angles indicate that the surface of talc monocrystals is hydrophobic , similar to that of pyrophyllite  @xcite .    to investigate this dichotomy , here we employ molecular dynamics simulations combined with recently developed algorithms @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in agreement with experiments , we find that at low rh , talc surfaces display hydrophilic behavior as water adsorbs strongly to the binding sites on the surface . </S>",
    "<S> however , at saturation , cohesive interactions dominate and the interaction between the surface binding sites and water is minimal , resulting in a hydrophobic surface .    to further explore the role of surface microstructure and the strength of the adhesive interactions on surface hydrophobicity , we also study similar clay minerals , pyrophyllite and fluorotalc , as well as modified talc surfaces with a range of binding site polarities , both at low relative humidity and at saturation . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the dual hydrophilic - hydrophobic behavior observed in talc , is generically expected to manifest for surfaces whose adhesive interaction energy lies in a special range . if the adhesion to water is strong enough to overcome the entropy of being in the vapor phase at low rh , water adsorbs strongly to the surface ( hydrophilic behavior ) . at the same time , if adhesion is too weak to overcome the cohesive interactions in water , the surface is hydrophobic at saturation . for modified talc surfaces with strong enough adhesion to overcome the cohesive interactions , all surface binding sites </S>",
    "<S> are occupied by water molecules at saturation , as expected . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , instead of observing complete wetting , we find that a water droplet sits atop the adsorbed water monolayer .      </S>",
    "<S> talc , fluorotalc and pyrophyllite are uncharged clay minerals , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , layered silicates of magnesium ( mg ) or aluminum ( al ) . </S>",
    "<S> they belong to the family of tot clays : each clay sheet consists of a layer of octahedrally coordinated mg or al oxide between two layers of tetrahedral silicon oxide ( see  [ fig : structure](a ) - side view ) . the surface of these sheets displays hexagonal rings of sio@xmath0 tetrahedra . in talc and fluorotalc , </S>",
    "<S> all octahedral sites are occupied by mg atoms , while in pyrophyllite two third of these sites are occupied by al atoms ( see  [ fig : structure](a ) - top view ) . </S>",
    "<S> the charge on mg and al is balanced by hydroxyl groups in the center of the hexagonal cavities . in talc , these hydroxyl groups are oriented perpendicular to the surface , and can participate in hydrogen bonds with water . in pyrophyllite , </S>",
    "<S> the hydroxyl groups are oriented parallel to the surface , and in fluorotalc , they are replaced by fluorine atoms . </S>",
