    "there are a few facts about the universe we live in that we have now become certain of .",
    "one such fact is that our universe is expanding . in 1929",
    "edwin hubble discovered that distant galaxies appear to be receding from us with velocity proportional to their distance ( see fig .",
    "[ hubble ] ) : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the famous hubble constant , whose value is @xcite .",
    "this observation marks the discovery that we live in an expanding universe .",
    "because the above relation is linear it can be deduced that there is no centre for this expansion ( called hubble expansion ) ; distant galaxies are receding away from any observer , wherever placed , according to the above relation . the universe expansion , as it is perceived today , does not correspond to galaxies travelling through space away from each - other but it is due to an expansion of space itself , between the galaxies , which is responsible for galaxies being pulled away from each - other .",
    "hence , according to hubble law above , the expansion of the universe is self - similar ; the three - dimensional equivalent of a photograph magnification .",
    "such a uniform expansion suggests that the content of the universe is also uniformly distributed .",
    "indeed , galaxy survey observations show that the distribution of galactic clusters and superclusters becomes uniform on scales above 100  mpc , which is about a few percent of the size of the observable universe ( e.g. see fig .",
    "[ 2df ] ) . that is to say that structure in the universe is not of fractal form ; one does not find bigger structures the larger the distance scale considered .",
    "instead , the largest structures correspond to bubble and filament like matter distributions comprised by galactic superclusters ( see fig .  [ 2df ] ) whose characteristic size ( @xmath2  100  mpc ) is much less than the cosmological horizon scale which marks the limit of our observational capability .",
    "the above correspond to observational support for the so - called _ cosmological principle _",
    ", which simply states that , on large scales , `` the universe is homogeneous and isotropic '' , i.e. invariant under translations and rotations .",
    "this means that there are no special points or directions in the universe , no centre , no edges and no axis of rotation . using the cosmological principle it has been possible to study the global dynamics of the universe as dictated by einstein s general relativity theory .",
    "according to general relativity there is no stable spacetime solution which contains uniformly distributed matter and radiation and remains static .",
    "hence , general relativity demands that the universe is either expanding or collapsing .",
    "this agrees well with the observed hubble expansion .",
    "now , going backwards in time , we would expect the universe to be contracting and its energy density increasing .",
    "this means that matter in the early universe is predominantly relativistic , with a planckian spectrum of high black - body temperature .",
    "furthermore , the universe content is fully ionised with matter being strongly coupled to radiation through thomson scattering . as the universe expands , its density is diluted and its temperature decreases . at some moment , the plasma filling the universe cools down enough to allow neutral atoms to form .",
    "when this occurs , the scattering of radiation from matter is drastically reduced , which means that the universe content becomes transparent , allowing radiation to travel free , similarly to what happens at the photosphere ; the visible surface of the sun . at that time radiation",
    "is said to `` decouple '' from matter .",
    "this released radiation fills all space and survives until the present time .",
    "indeed , in 1978 penzias and wilson won the nobel prize because they discovered this so - called cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation .",
    "as shown in fig ,  [ cmb ] , the cmb has an almost perfect blackbody spectrum peaked at microwave wavelengths corresponding to temperature of @xmath3  k. the distribution of the cmb is extremely uniform with minute variations in its temperature at the level .",
    "such uniformity is another piece of supporting evidence for the cosmological principle .",
    "the existence of the cmb shows that the early universe was hot and dense and a lot different from the universe at present .",
    "this fact , along with the observation that the universe is expanding , agrees well with general relativity which suggests that our expanding universe has finite age .",
    "this means that , when travelling backwards in time , the reversed expansion is such that all distances shrink in a self - similar manner to zero in finite time . that initial moment of infinite density has been dubbed the big bang ; the onset of time itself .",
    "the latest dynamical estimate for the age of the universe is @xmath4  gyrs @xcite , which is in good agreement with estimates of the ages of the oldest astrophysical objects such as , for example , globular star clusters @xcite .",
    "hence , cosmologists today operate in the framework of a standard model , which considers that the universe began its existence 14 billion years ago , passed through a hot period of ultra - high density , and has continued to cool down until the present because of the expansion of space .",
    "this back - bone history of the universe is called the hot big bang and has been observationally confirmed as far back as the time when the universe was no more than a few seconds old .      despite the observational support for the hot big bang",
    "the fact is that , fundamentally , the cosmological principle is incompatible with a finite age for the universe .",
    "this paradox is the so - called _ horizon problem _ and has to do with the apparent uniformity of the universe over distances which are causally unconnected .",
    "for example , the cmb appears to be correlated at regions beyond the causal correlation scale ( the so - called particle horizon ) ; it appears to be in thermal equilibrium and at a preferred reference frame .",
    "general relativity does not single out a preferred reference frame , which would imply that doppler shifts in the frequency of the cmb over causally unconnected regions ( with different centre of mass frames ) would result in @xmath5 .",
    "in contrast , observations suggest that matter at these regions does lie at the same reference frame when the cmb is emitted and the fractional perturbation of the cmb temperature is much smaller",
    ".    one can understand the problem schematically by considering the spacetime diagram in fig .",
    "[ horizon ] .",
    "the slanted lines depict signals which travel with the speed of light , which is the fastest possible propagation through space . along the time axis",
    "the present time @xmath6yrs is depicted at the tip of our past light - cone , that is the region of spacetime from which we can receive signals and lies below the large slanted lines in the diagram .",
    "the horizontal line corresponds to the time of the decoupling of radiation from matter , when the cmb was emitted at @xmath7yrs .",
    "the small triangles correspond to the light - cones at the time of decoupling and designate the regions which are in causal contact when the cmb was emitted ; at @xmath8 an observer can not be affected by events occurring beyond his / her light - cone . because @xmath9 our field of vision today includes a large number of regions which were beyond causal contact at the time of the cmb emission and yet these uncorrelated regions appear to be in thermal equilibrium at the same temperature",
    ".     +    the most compelling mechanism to date which overcomes the horizon problem is the theory of _ cosmic inflation _ originally suggested by guth @xcite and independently by starobinsky @xcite . in a nutshell",
    ", cosmic inflation can be defined as a brief period of superluminal expansion of space in the early universe .",
    "general relativity allows inflation because the latter does not correspond to displacement of matter or energy through space with velocity faster than lightspeed .",
    "instead , it is space itself which is expanding faster than light can travel .",
    "indeed , inflationary expansion is readily obtained by general relativity if certain conditions are satisfied .    how does inflation overcome the horizon problem ?",
    "well , inflation produces correlations beyond the causal horizon by expanding an initially causally connected region to a size large enough to encompass the observable universe .",
    "the region which corresponds to the observable universe is supposed to lie within the light - cone before the onset of inflation .",
    "being initially causally self - correlated it can become uniform by interacting with itself . after it is inflated to super - horizon distances this original uniformity sets up uniform initial conditions after inflation , even if the original region corresponds to many causally - disconnected regions .",
    "this is depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ horizon ] , where during inflation the growth of an initially causally correlated region is shown to be faster than lightspeed so as to engulf the entire field of vision today .",
    "hence , we see that , provided it lasts long enough , cosmic inflation can impose the cosmological principle as an initial condition for the hot big bang",
    ". however , if the cosmological principle was exact then there would be no structure in the universe ; no galaxies , no stars with planets harbouring intelligent life .",
    "all these structures require the uniformity of the universe to be violated . if not , the universe today would be filled only with the cmb radiation and a thinned out gas at temperature @xmath10 , evenly distributed through space .",
    "our existence demands that the cosmological principle is only approximately respected .",
    "it so happens that cosmic inflation can provide also a small violation of the cosmological principle .",
    "this is due to quantum effects during inflation , which , as explained below , can introduce a tiny variation in the density @xmath11 of the universe , called the _ primordial density perturbation _  @xmath12 .",
    "+    this density perturbation reflects itself onto the cmb through the so - called sachs - wolfe effect @xcite , which describes how the cmb photons become redshifted when crossing regions of density higher than average ( so - called overdensities ) because they lose energy while struggling to exit from the gravitational potential wells of these growing overdensities .",
    "hence , variations in the density of the universe cause perturbations in the apparent temperature of the cmb radiation : @xmath13 indeed the observations ( e.g. see fig .  [ wmap ] ) suggest that @xmath14 @xcite , which , albeit tiny , turns out to be enough to explain the formation of structures in the universe , such as galaxies and galactic clusters . starting from an initial density perturbation , structure formation proceeds through the process of _ gravitational instability_. the latter amounts to intensifying , in a runaway manner , the contrast between overdense and underdense regions and is based on the fact that overdensities grow more massive by attracting matter from surrounding underdensities , depleting them even further .",
    "indeed , numerical simulations have shown that density perturbations of magnitude @xmath15 at @xmath8 suffice to generate the observed structures given 14 billion years of growth .",
    "therefore , it seems that inflation can successfully impose both the cosmological principle onto the universe and the deviations from it , which are necessary for structure formation .",
    "inflation produces the primordial density perturbation through a process called _ particle production _ that arises from considering the superluminal expansion of space in conjunction with the notion of the quantum vacuum .",
    "we are all familiar with the concept of the classical vacuum .",
    "a box filled with vacuum is a box which is totally empty of matter and energy , i.e. the energy in the box is .",
    "however , in quantum theory , this can not be true and the box has to have .",
    "this is due to _ heisenberg s uncertainty principle _ , which , for energy , can be expressed mathematically as @xmath16 the meaning of the above expression is that the energy of a closed system ( such as our box ) can not be precisely determined but it has to fluctuate by an amount @xmath17 , which , in a given time period @xmath18 , has to satisfy the above constraint .",
    "the crucial point is that the reduced planck s constant is planck s constant . ]",
    "@xmath19 featured above , is small but positive , which means that , for any finite time interval , @xmath17 has to be non - zero .",
    "in fact , the smaller the period of time considered the larger the fluctuation of the energy has to be .",
    "hence , the uncertainty principle amounts to a controlled violation of energy conservation .",
    "this violation manifests itself as the brief appearance of pairs of particles and anti - particles , the reason being that other quantities such as the electric charge or other quantum numbers , are indeed conserved .",
    "consequently , the quantum vacuum is not empty but , instead , it is filled with constantly appearing and disappearing pairs of so - called virtual particles and anti - particles ( see fig .  [ qv ] ) .",
    "the energy of these virtual particles is the so - called vacuum ( or zero - point ) energy .",
    "the above may sound like a bunch of flowery ideas , but it so happens that there is experimental proof of the existence of virtual particles .",
    "this is the famous casimir experiment , first realised by casimir and polder in 1948 @xcite .",
    "consider a pair of parallel conducting plates , not electrically charged and not connected through an electrical circuit .",
    "the plates are just standing in empty space ( i.e. in vacuum ) , close to each - other as shown in fig .",
    "[ casimir ] .",
    "classically there is no force on the plates except from their mutual gravitational attraction , which is extremely weak and can be ignored .",
    "now , let us consider the existence of virtual particles in the space between the plates and in particular , the appearance of virtual photons .",
    "photons are the quanta of the electromagnetic field .",
    "they can be thought of as wave packets of electromagnetic radiation whose energy @xmath20 is related to their wavelength @xmath21 as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "the existence of photons has been confirmed by the photo - electric phenomenon , whose particle interpretation awarded einstein his nobel prize in 1921 .",
    "now , since the plates are conducting they can not allow a non - zero electric field inside them .",
    "hence , virtual photons appearing between the plates can only have a discrete spectrum of energies , corresponding to wavelengths that satisfy the constraint @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a positive integer and @xmath26 is the distance between the plates .",
    "the above constraint ensures that the amplitude of the electric field remains zero at the surface of the conducting plates , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ casimir ] .",
    "however , the virtual photons appearing outside the plates are not constrained by the above relation and can have any wavelength .",
    "this means that many more energies of virtual photons are allowed outside the plates compared to the discrete spectrum allowed between the plates .",
    "thus , the vacuum energy density in the space between the plates is different from the one outside the plates .",
    "this difference ( gradient ) of vacuum energy gives rise to a force @xmath27 , which has been measured and found to be in precise agreement with the predictions of quantum electrodynamics , confirming thereby the existence of virtual photons @xcite .      before combining the notion of the quantum vacuum with cosmic inflation",
    "we need to briefly discuss black holes .",
    "black holes are predicted by general relativity and are thought to exist astrophysically , for example in the centres of galaxies .",
    "a black hole is an extremely compact object with a gravitational field which is locally so intense that anything approaching close enough can never escape .",
    "indeed , a black hole is surrounded by an _ event horizon _ , which is the surface on which the escape velocity from the black hole is equal to the speed of light .",
    "this means that one would need to travel with the speed of light away from the black hole simply to remain on the event horizon . within the horizon",
    "the gravitational attraction is so strong that , even when travelling with lightspeed , one can not avoid being pulled inwards . since no matter or energy can travel faster than the speed of light the event horizon forms a boundary on the causal structure of spacetime in the sense that events within the event horizon can not affect events outside it .",
    "one can think of the event horizon as a surface which is permeable from one direction only ( from the outside ) . a classical black hole , being enclosed within an event horizon , can only absorb matter and energy which is captured by its pull from its environment .",
    "in - falling matter increases the gravitational field of the black hole , which in turn increases the radius of its event horizon as the gravitational pull further extends its effect in the surrounding space .",
    "hence , a classical black hole can only increase in mass and size .",
    "such was the understanding of black holes until hawking studied them in conjunction with the quantum vacuum . hawking considered the appearance of virtual particle pairs in the vicinity of the event horizon .",
    "suppose that one of the particles of the pair falls within the event horizon as shown in fig .",
    "the other part of the pair may follow it , but since it is still outside the event horizon , it has a non - zero ( albeit tiny ) probability of escaping from the black hole , whereas , by definition of the event horizon , the particle within it has no chance of escaping .",
    "thus , since pairs of virtual particles are constantly appearing from nothing ( through the controlled violation of energy conservation by the uncertainty principle ) in the vicinity of the event horizon , the net effect of the above possibility is that a tiny fraction of virtual particles does escape from the black hole .",
    "such particles can not meet their counterparts of the original pair because the latter have fallen within the event horizon and can never escape .",
    "therefore , these particles can not annihilate with their partners ; their conserved quantum numbers can not disappear .",
    "consequently , the virtual particles which avoided falling within the event horizon ( while their partners did not ) survive and become real particles , which can be detected by distant observers @xcite .",
    "stable real particles can survive indefinitely . for stable particles which used to be virtual particles that escaped from the event horizon of a black hole",
    ", this means that @xmath18 in the uncertainty relation ( that allowed their existence ) can become very large .",
    "thus , we find @xmath28 , i.e. over large time periods , energy conservation has to be restored",
    ". since the particles which escaped from the black hole , can be detected by an observer to have a positive energy @xmath29 , with respect to this distant observer , the pair partners of these particles ( the ones which did fall into the black hole ) must have energy @xmath30 , where @xmath31 .",
    "hence , from the viewpoint of the distant observer , the black hole appears to be absorbing particles of negative energy which equals in magnitude the positive energy of the particles radiated away having escaped from the event horizon .",
    "receiving negative energy the black hole reduces in mass and its event horizon reduces in size , while emitting energy ( equivalent to its mass reduction ) in the form of so - called _ hawking radiation_. hawking found that the emitted radiation has a black - body spectrum corresponding to a characteristic temperature , called the _ hawking temperature _ @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , @xmath32 was found to increase the smaller the black hole becomes , i.e. the emission of hawking radiation intensifies as the black hole shrinks .",
    "this runaway behaviour ends up in the evaporation of the black hole @xcite .",
    "turning this around , the emission of hawking radiation from supermassive astrophysical black holes , such as the ones in the centres of galaxies , is negligible and is overwhelmed by absorption of positive energy from their environment , such as surrounding matter or even the cmb radiation .      what does black hole evaporation have to do with cosmic inflation ?",
    "well , it so happens that the cosmological horizon ( the range of causal correlations ) during inflation corresponds to an event horizon of an `` inverted '' black hole ; a black hole `` inside - out '' , centred at the observer .",
    "this can be understood by considering that , during inflation , matter inside the horizon is being `` sucked out '' by the superluminal expansion of space , in analogy with the fact that nearby matter is being `` sucked in '' by a black hole . in this manner the virtual particle pairs of the quantum vacuum can be pulled outside the horizon before they have a chance to annihilate as shown in fig .",
    "[ superlum ] . in this case , being over superhorizon distance apart , they are beyond causal contact and can never find each - other to annihilate .",
    "thus , they cease being virtual particles and become real particles instead .",
    "this is why this process is called _ particle production _",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is important to state here that the existence of an event horizon suffices to have particle production .",
    "it is the division of the causal structure of spacetime , enforced by the event horizon , which gives rise to the particle production process ; the separation of the virtual particle pairs .",
    "thus , the event horizon , once it exists , can be seen to emit hawking radiation without the need of a black hole or any concentration of mass .    during inflation ,",
    "the event horizon is filled with hawking radiation ( since it corresponds to the outside of the `` inverted '' black hole ) . since , the horizon is centred at the observer and we can put an observer anywhere in space , this means that all space is filled with hawking radiation , i.e. particle production occurs everywhere once we have superluminal expansion .",
    "now , in quantum theory , particles correspond to waves with an associated de broglie wavelength .",
    "for example , a massive particle of mass @xmath33 is characterised by a wavelength @xmath34 .",
    "this dual nature of particles is hard to visualise , although we are all familiar with many `` particle - like '' properties of waves , such as the reflection of an incident sea wave on a concrete wall .",
    "it is also easy to accept that waves , like particles , carry energy and momentum , e.g. radio - waves , laser beams or tsunami waves .",
    "particles correspond to waves travelling on an otherwise smooth sea , which we call a field ( the particle is part of the field as the sea wave is part of the sea ) , for example photons travel through the sea of the electromagnetic field .",
    "virtual particles of the quantum vacuum , therefore , correspond to spontaneously arising ripples on the calm sea of their corresponding fields .",
    "this is why they are also referred to as quantum fluctuations of these  fields .",
    "based on the above , the particle production process during inflation can be also understood as the stretching of quantum fluctuations by the superluminal expansion of space , to superhorizon distances .",
    "this stretching transforms the quantum fluctuations into classical perturbations of the fields .",
    "one can imagine them as mountains and valleys , corresponding to classical variations of the field in question over superhorizon distances .",
    "a variation of the values of fields gives rise to a variation of their energy density .",
    "this , therefore , is the way that particle production during inflation produces variations of the density of the universe which generate the primordial density perturbation , that sources the formation of structures in the universe @xcite .",
    "schematically , we can write @xmath35+{\\sf inflation } \\;\\rightarrow\\ ; \\frac{\\delta\\phi}{\\phi}\\;\\rightarrow\\ ; \\frac{\\delta\\rho}{\\rho } \\;\\rightarrow\\;{\\sf galaxies}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is one of the fields in question , whose typical variation during inflation is given by the hawking temperature @xmath37 .",
    "thus , according to this scenario , all structures in the universe , such as galaxies , stars , planets and ultimately ourselves , originated as quantum fluctuations ( like the ones we observe in the lab through the casimir experiment ) during a period of superluminal expansion of space .",
    "do we have any observational support for this amazing scenario ?",
    "indeed we do .",
    "high precision observations of the cmb temperature perturbations , which are due to the primordial density perturbation , have revealed a stunning agreement with the predictions of inflation .",
    "[ peaks ] depicts an analysis of these temperature perturbations in spherical harmonics , which follows the theoretical prediction of inflation ( shown by the solid lines ) with remarkable consistency @xcite .",
    "it was this kind of analysis that led to the collapse of a rival theory for the generation of the density perturbations ( that of cosmic strings ) , which did not predict a sequence of peaks in the angular spectrum @xcite ( they are clearly observed in fig .  [ peaks ] ) .",
    "the simplest and most natural realisations of inflation suggest that the hawking temperature @xmath32 remains roughly constant during the inflationary phase of the universe .",
    "this means that the variations of the fields , produced by the particle production process , are of the same amplitude even though they may correspond to much different length - scales , because the quantum fluctuations which exit the horizon early are stretched to much larger distances than those which exit the horizon later on . as a result",
    "we expect that the spectrum of the density perturbations is almost scale - invariant , i.e. their amplitude is independent of the length - scale considered .",
    "indeed , parameterising the scale dependence of the perturbation spectrum on the wavenumber  @xmath38 as @xmath39 , we expect that the spectral index would be @xmath40 , where @xmath41 with @xmath42 being the corresponding length - scale .",
    "the latest observations suggest that @xmath43 @xcite , which is very close to scale - invariance exactly as inflation predicts .",
    "the deviation from exact scale invariance was also expected , and has to do with the fact that the inflationary expansion has to end well before the first second of the universe history .",
    "another feature of the observed cmb temperature perturbations which agrees well with inflation is the fact that they appear to be predominantly gaussian .",
    "the nature of quantum fluctuations is stochastic ( that is to say random ) which suggests that @xmath44 has a gaussian bell - shaped distribution centred at @xmath32 .",
    "thus , inflation naturally predicts gaussian perturbations , as is indeed observed .    the most important feature of the observations which supports the inflationary scenario for the generation of the primordial density perturbation is the following .",
    "the main peak in the angular power spectrum in fig .  [ peaks ] corresponds to the scale of the cosmological horizon at the time @xmath8 of the emission of the cmb . as shown in fig .",
    "[ peaks ] , this peak corresponds to the multipole moment with @xmath45 . in the bottom half ( the te part ) of fig .",
    "[ peaks ] , we see that there is an anti - correlation feature at multipole moments significantly lower than the one of the main peak , which correspond to superhorizon scales at the time of the emission of the cmb .",
    "this means that the density perturbations show correlations beyond the causal horizon , a feature that only the superluminal expansion of an inflationary phase can explain .",
    "looking into the particle production process in more depth one has to wonder which kind of fields are the ones whose quantum fluctuations are responsible for the generation of the primordial density perturbation . until recently , all mechanisms considered the use of scalar fields for the density perturbations .",
    "scalar fields are hypothetical spin - zero fields , which are characterised by one degree of freedom , that is a single value at a given point in space .",
    "scalar fields are ubiquitous in theories beyond the standard model of particle physics , such as supersymmetry ( the scalar partners of the observed fermion fields ) or string theory ( the so - called moduli fields , which parametrise the size and shape of the hypothesised extra dimensions ) .",
    "however , it has to be stressed that no scalar field has ever been observed .",
    "this means that designing models using unobserved scalar fields undermines their predictability and falsifiability , despite the high precision of the recent cosmological observations .",
    "the standard model of particle physics does contain one scalar field , which is the only piece of it that has not been experimentally confirmed .",
    "this is the famous higgs field , thought to be responsible for the masses of standard model particles ( which are all the known particles such as electrons , quarks and so on ) .",
    "observing the quanta of this field , the higgs bosons , is one of the primary objectives of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , which is about to become operational in the coming months in cern , geneva .",
    "observation of the higgs particles , among other things , will substantiate the claim that scalar fields do exist and are not merely mathematical constructions .",
    "however , what if the higgs bosons are not found by the lhc ?",
    "do we have an alternative proposal for the generation of the density perturbations from inflation ?",
    "can we form the galaxies without scalar fields ?      recently , a proposal alternative to scalar fields has been put forward , which uses vector boson fields instead @xcite .",
    "these are spin - one fields , characterised by three degrees of freedom corresponding to their magnitude , direction and orientation at every point in space .",
    "in contrast to scalar fields , vector bosons are indeed observed .",
    "the standard model of particle physics contains four vector boson fields : one is the familiar photon , i.e. the quantum of the electromagnetic field , and then we have the three massive vector bosons of the weak nuclear force - decay , which transforms neutrons to protons by emission of electrons , otherwise known as @xmath46-radiation . ]",
    ", which are the so - called z - boson and the w@xmath47-bosons , that have been observed in cern in the 80s .",
    "vector bosons were not originally considered as candidates for the particle production process in inflation because of two generic obstacles , which were thought to inhibit their suitability for this role .",
    "the major obstacle has to do with the inherent anisotropic nature of vector fields .",
    "inflation would homogenise a vector field as it does with everything else in the universe when it solves the horizon problem .",
    "now , if a vector field is to generate or even affect the primordial density perturbation it needs to dominate ( or nearly dominate ) the content of the universe at some time so that it can affect the universe expansion rate .",
    "however , a uniform vector field ( homogenised by inflation ) is , in general , anisotropic because it picks up a preferred direction in space .",
    "if such an anisotropic contribution to the density of the universe became dominant it would result in anisotropic expansion which would , ultimately , be in conflict with the predominant isotropy of the uniform cmb radiation .",
    "however , it can be shown that this problem can be overcome if the vector field is undergoing rapid coherent oscillations when it dominates the universe @xcite .",
    "the equation of motion for a homogeneous massive ( and abelian ) vector field in the expanding universe is @xmath48 where the dot denotes time derivative , @xmath33 is the mass of the field and @xmath49 is the fractional rate of the universe expansion ; the so - called hubble parameter , whose value today is the hubble constant @xmath1 featured in the hubble law .",
    "originally the vector field is taken to be subdominant , i.e. its contribution to the density budget of the universe is negligible .",
    "after inflation the universe expansion rate is gradually decreasing so that the value of the hubble parameter @xmath49 diminishes .",
    "eventually , we have @xmath50 , which means that one can ignore the second term in the above equation of motion ( the so - called friction term ) rendering the equation similar to the one of a harmonic oscillator .",
    "hence , the homogeneous massive vector field eventually undergoes harmonic oscillations , with frequency @xmath33 , much larger than the inverse of the characteristic timescale of the universe expansion , given by @xmath49 .",
    "these harmonic oscillations rapidly alternate the orientation of the vector field . as a result ,",
    "the oscillating massive homogeneous vector field features no net direction and behaves like an isotropic fluid .",
    "therefore , it can dominate the universe content without generating an excessive large - scale anisotropy @xcite , which would otherwise be in conflict with the  cmb .",
    "the second obstacle to the use of vector bosons for the particle production process is more subtle . in the case of scalar fields , particle production during inflation requires the mass of the virtual particles to be small @xmath51 , otherwise they annihilate before being pulled over superhorizon distances by the superluminal expansion .",
    "hence , scalar fields need to be light to undergo particle production during inflation .",
    "if the same argument is applied to vector fields then a problem arises : light vector boson fields are approximately conformally invariant , which inhibits their particle production .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "a massless vector field ( e.g. the photon ) is conformally invariant .",
    "this suggests that it is unaffected by the expansion of the universe , because it perceives this expansion as a conformal transformation to which it is insensitive . in terms of its virtual particles",
    ", this means that they are not pulled outside the horizon during inflation by the superluminal expansion .",
    "hence , the quantum fluctuations of a massless vector field are not stretched by the expansion to become classical perturbations .",
    "consequently , a light vector field is approximately conformally invariant , so one would expect the particle production process to be suppressed . to overcome this obstacle an explicit breakdown of the vector field conformality",
    "is required .",
    "fortunately , there are numerous mechanisms in the literature which achieve this , but the disadvantage is that particle production is model - dependent ; it depends on the mechanism considered . on the positive side",
    "though , this very fact may allow us to discriminate between mechanisms , through comparison with observations .",
    "there are a number of observational characteristics which may signify the contribution of a vector field to the primordial density perturbation .",
    "for example , in the above described mechanism which employed an oscillating massive vector field , there is a chance to produce a weak large - scale anisotropy in the universe .",
    "the reason is that the coherent oscillations of the massive vector field are not exactly harmonic because their amplitude is gradually decreasing as their energy density is depleted by the universe expansion .",
    "because of this , the oscillating vector field is not exactly isotropic , which means that , if it dominates the universe , it may give rise to a weak large - scale anisotropy .",
    "it so happens that there is recent tantalising evidence that such a weak large - scale anisotropy does exist in the cmb .",
    "indeed , there is a highly improbable correlation found between the quadrupole and octupole moments in the cmb angular spectrum , which reveals the existence or a preferred direction , called the `` axis of evil '' @xcite .",
    "plotted along this direction ( instead of the usual galactic coordinates ) low multipoles in the cmb produce a clear pattern , as shown in fig .",
    "an oscillating vector field may well explain this feature , which is impossible to account for under the traditional scalar field mechanisms .",
    "a potentially clearer signal for the contribution of vector fields to the primordial density perturbation is the appearance of statistical anisotropy in the cmb temperature perturbations .",
    "statistical anisotropy amounts to anisotropic patterns arising in the cmb designating special orientation .",
    "an example of how such patterns might look like is shown in fig .",
    ". one can think of them as similar to patterns in city planning produced by rows of identical houses .",
    "statistical anisotropy in the cmb can arise due to anisotropic particle production during inflation @xcite .",
    "as mentioned , vector fields have three degrees of freedom and can be analysed in three independent components .",
    "each of these components undergoes particle production during inflation if the conformality of the vector field is suitably broken .",
    "however , the efficiency of the particle production process may be different for each of these components and depends on the mechanism which breaks the conformal invariance of the vector field .",
    "statistical anisotropy is a new observable , which is inherently connected with a vector field contribution to the density perturbations .",
    "so far there is no observational detection of statistical anisotropic patterns in the cmb or in the distribution of structures in the universe ( e.g. rows of galaxies ) .",
    "however , the observational bounds are rather weak and allow the existence of statistical anisotropy at a level as high as 30% @xcite .",
    "the planck satellite , which was launched in may of 2009 by the european space agency , is expected to increase the cmb precision measurements by an order of magnitude and it is highly likely to observe statistical anisotropy .",
    "the main mission of the planck satellite is to observe non - gaussian features in the predominantly gaussian cmb temperature perturbations .",
    "if a vector field contributes to the primordial density perturbation the non - gaussianity in the cmb can also be anisotropic , in a direction which is correlated to the statistical anisotropy of the perturbation spectrum @xcite .",
    "this is a smoking gun for the contribution of vector fields in the formation of structures in the universe .      before concluding let us discuss an interesting possible spin - off of the above ideas , which might connect the formation of structures in the universe with cosmic magnetism .",
    "observations suggest that the majority of galaxies carry magnetic fields of equipartition strength : @xmath52 g @xcite , meaning that their energy density is comparable to the kinetic energy density of the galaxy . in spirals",
    "the magnetic field follows the spiral arms @xcite ( see for example fig .",
    "[ pmf ] ) .",
    "this means that it is not frozen into the plasma of the galactic disk , which strongly suggests that it is instead rearranged by a magnetic dynamo mechanism , similar to the one that operates in our sun .",
    "the magnetic dynamo can also amplify an initial magnetic field up to equipartition value ( when dynamic backreaction stops further amplification ) but it needs a non - zero seed field to feed on . for the sun the seed field is presumed to be the magnetic field of the milky way . for galaxies at the time of formation the seed field needs to be at least as strong as @xmath53 g @xcite with a coherency scale @xmath54pc , corresponding to the largest turbulent eddy .",
    "the origin of this seed field remains elusive .",
    "suppose that the hypercharge vector boson field of the electroweak theory ( i.e. the unification of electromagnetism with the weak nuclear force ) has , through some mechanism , its conformality broken during inflation , so that it obtains a flat superhorizon spectrum of perturbations . after inflation ,",
    "the universe cools down due to its expansion . at some moment ,",
    "electroweak unification breaks down when the temperature of the hot big bang reduces below @xmath55gev , where @xmath56 is the boltzmann constant . at the electroweak phase transition",
    ", the hypercharge field is projected onto the photon and the z - boson directions , through the weinberg angle as shown in fig .",
    "[ ysplit ] . the z - boson condensate , being massive , rapidly oscillates a few tens of times before decaying to other lighter standard model particles .",
    "during these oscillations its superhorizon perturbation spectrum ( which is due to the projection of the original hypercharge spectrum ) might affect the density perturbation in the universe if the density of the oscillating field is comparable to the density of the universe at the time .",
    "the photon superhorizon perturbations ( also due to the hypercharge spectrum ) give rise to a magnetic field with scale dependence @xmath57 . due to the high conductivity of the primordial plasma",
    "the magnetic field flux is conserved and the magnetic field survives until the epoch of galaxy formation .",
    "it is a simple calculation to show that , provided the z - boson has enough density to nearly dominate the universe before its decay , the primordial magnetic field is strong and coherent enough to trigger the galactic dynamo and explain the magnetic fields of the galaxies @xcite .",
    "this scenario , if realised , may connect directly cmb observations of statistical anisotropy with galactic magnetism .",
    "according to state of the art cosmology , all structures in the universe , including galaxies , stars , planets and ourselves , originated as quantum fluctuations of suitable fields similar to the ones which we observe in the lab with the casimir experiment .",
    "these quantum fluctuations were transformed into classical perturbations ( giving rise to the primordial density perturbation ) when stretched to sizes larger than the cosmological horizon ( the range of causal correlations ) during a brief period of superluminal expansion of space , called cosmic inflation .",
    "inflation had to take place in the very early stages of the universe history in order to solve one of the fundamental paradoxes of modern cosmology , the so - called horizon problem , i.e. the apparent uniformity of the universe over distances which appear to be beyond causal contact .",
    "inflation forces this uniformity onto the universe by expanding an originally causally connected region of space to size large enough to encompass the observable universe at present .",
    "inflation also creates the deviations from uniformity which are necessary for the formation of structures , by generating the primordial density perturbation , which leads to structure formation through the process of gravitational instability .",
    "recent precise observations of the perturbations of the temperature of cmb radiation , which reflect the primordial density perturbation , confirm both the particle production process through which these perturbations were generated , and also cosmic inflation itself .",
    "these observations are the earliest data at hand , since inflation has to take place when the universe is only a tiny fraction of a second old .",
    "the precision of cosmological observations has reached the level which demands theoretical model - building to become detailed and rigorous . because of this and also in light of the forthcoming lhc findings it may be necessary to explore alternatives beyond the traditional scalar field hypothesis for the realisation of the particle production process during inflation .",
    "one such possibility is considering vector boson fields .",
    "massive vector fields can indeed generate the primordial density perturbation without excessive large - scale anisotropy if they undergo coherent oscillations before they dominate the universe .",
    "the scenario is characterised by a number of distinct observational signatures .",
    "for example it may explain the observed weak large - scale anisotropy already found in the cmb ( `` axis of evil '' ) and it can give rise to statistical anisotropy in the cmb temperature perturbations , which amounts to direction dependent patterns that , at present , are allowed at a level up to 30% and may well be detected by the forthcoming observations of the planck satellite mission .",
    "non - gaussian features in the cmb perturbations may also be anisotropic in a manner correlated with the statistical anisotropy in the cmb spectrum .",
    "this would be a smoking gun for the contribution of a vector field in the density perturbation of the universe .",
