    "spectroscopic studies of cuprates over the years have shown that at low energies these materials exhibit quite a complex spectral structure , which changes with temperature and doping in a complicated way .",
    "often there appears to be reasonable agreement regarding some of the main features between various experimental techniques .",
    "for example , optical femtosecond quasiparticle relaxation measurements and single - particle ( giever ) tunneling show a similar size pseudogap in the spectrum over a large portion of the phase diagram , and the latter is remarkably similar to the spectral features measured by angle - resolved photoemission",
    ". however , the pseudogap @xmath8 as observed by spectroscopies like nmr  and spin - polarized neutron scattering appears to be smaller than the optical and tunneling pseudogap @xmath9 by approximately a factor of 2 , for which there is as yet no accepted theoretical explanation .",
    "thus in spite of the availability of spectral data over a large range of doping in many materials , the interpretatation of the low - energy excitation spectrum is still highly controversial . in this paper",
    "we summarize some of the results of time - resolved quasiparticle recombination spectroscopy as a function of doping and temperature in yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 , which appear to give qualitative new insight into the origin of the low - energy spectral features of this material and its phase diagram .",
    "we compare the doping - evolution of the pseudogap @xmath5 obtained from time - resolved spectroscopy with a quantitative analysis of the  spin - gap  from the nmr knight shift @xmath10 in the underdoped state using the same type of @xmath6-independent gap as deduced from the quasiparticle relaxation data .",
    "we find that the time - resolved qp relaxation data are quite consistent with giever tunneling and arpes data and suggest that all the observations together can be explained by the existence of a pair - breaking pseudogap @xmath5 and a triplet - state local pair excitation @xmath4 at @xmath11 .",
    "the time - resolved optical spectroscopy applied to superconductors and other materials with a gap has been given in detail elsewhere@xcite , so here we shall discuss only the results .",
    "the equations describing the temperature dependence of photoexcited qp density and their lifetime as a function of temperature are given by kabanov et al @xcite .",
    "using these equations , the properties of the gap can be investigated as a function of doping and temperature .",
    "[ hb ]    systematic experiments on ybacuo  as a function of o concentration over a wide range of @xmath12 have shown very clear and systematic behavior of the qp dynamics @xcite . particularly important",
    "is that the results are quite insensitive to surface quality and have been repeated after a period of a year with the same results .",
    "single crystals were also studied and no significant differences were found in comparison with the thin film data .",
    "these measurements have recently been extended to the overdoped state using calcium - doped ( y , ca)ba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 crystals by demsar et al @xcite , giving data on the whole phase diagram from insulating and underdoped to overdoped ybco . a typical time - resolved signal in the optimally doped phase is shown in figure 1 . above @xmath7 ,",
    "one exponential short - lived decay is observed whose amplitude is decreasing as @xmath6 is increased ( figure 2 ) , while below @xmath7 , two exponentials are clearly seen , one of which has a longer lifetime which is temperature-_dependent _ and diverges as @xmath13 .",
    "such behaviour is typical also for overdoped samples , but not for underdoped samples , where only a single exponential decay is observed , with a @xmath6-indendent time constant @xmath14 ps showing no anomaly at @xmath7 . from these experiments",
    "we can deduce that in underdoped state the evolution of the qp dynamics with temperature and doping is dominated by a temperature - independent pseudogap @xmath9 .",
    "near optimum doping an _ additional _ bcs - like temperature - dependent gap @xmath15 appears below @xmath16 which is present also in all the overdoped samples @xcite and gives rise to the additional temperature - dependent relaxation process below @xmath7 .",
    "the fact the @xmath17 diverges near @xmath7 unambiguously signifies that @xmath18 at @xmath7 .",
    "thus close to optimum doping and in the overdoped state two gaps appear to be present simultaneously , a feature consistent with the spatially inhomogeneous ground state@xcite in which the pair - breaking excitation is represented by @xmath9 , while the @xmath15 is a gap associated with the collective behaviour of high - carrier density stripes or clusters which start to form near optimum doping .",
    "the values of the gaps @xmath5 and @xmath19 as a function of doping obtained by fitting the temperature dependence of the photoinduced signal amplitude as shown in fig .",
    "2 with the model calculation of kabanov et al @xcite are plotted in figure 4 .",
    "from the time - resolved data on the underdoped ybco we have deduced that the low - energy spectrum can be described by a _ _  _ _ single__temperature - independent gap _ _ @xmath5 . starting from this observation we decided to analyse the temperature dependence of the nmr  knight shift @xmath20 available from the literature using the same @xmath6-indepedent @xmath21 the aim is a ) to see if the simple model can describe the @xmath6-dependence of k@xmath22 and b ) to see if the values of the pseudogap obtained for the nmr k@xmath22 agree with the optical values .",
    "the nmr  knight shift for such a case can be written as @xcite @xmath23,$ ] where @xmath24 is the value of @xmath10 at zero temperature , @xmath25 is an exponent which depends on the shape of the singularity of the dos at the gap and @xmath26 is a constant depending on the nmr nucleus .    the results of fits to published data in ybco 123 and 124 on @xmath27y@xcite , @xmath28cu @xcite and @xmath29o@xcite are shown in figure 3 using @xmath30 in spite of its simplicity , the model appears to describe the data very well . the gap values @xmath4 with @xmath31 obtained for yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 are shown in figure 4 .",
    "@xmath32 appears consistently lower than the @xmath5 by approximately a factor of 2 .",
    "apart from nmr @xmath10 , spin - polarized neutron scattering ( spns ) also shows a spin - excitation peak at 34 mev ( @xmath33390 k ) in underdoped yba@xmath1cu@xmath34o@xmath35 , which is smaller than @xmath5 by approximately a factor of 2 .",
    "however , the anomalies in the phonons signifying the presence of _ charge _ excitations occur near 70 mev ( @xmath33810k ) , also approximately twice the spin excitation energy and very close to the @xmath36 in fig .",
    "( see mook et al , this volume ) .",
    "to explain the two different gaps @xmath5 and @xmath4 , we propose a rather straightforward electronic structure in ybco . a schematic diagram is shown in the insert to fig .",
    "the ground state is composed of _ local _ s=0 singlet cooper pairs .",
    "since @xmath5 is a qp  charge excitation it is clearly associated with pair breaking .",
    "however , if @xmath37 , the triplet local pair state also exists and lies within the gap . it should be visible by spin - flip spectroscopies like nmr and spns , but not by optical spectroscopy or sp  tunneling which are charge excitations .",
    "we therefore propose that the @xmath4 observed by nmr  and spns is the s=1 _ local pair _ triplet excited state . from the experimental data in fig .",
    "4 , both @xmath5 and @xmath4 decrease with increasing doping , more or less as 1/@xmath38 , where @xmath38 is the hole density . for low doping , at @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 800k , consistent with raman and neutron measurements .",
    "we note that possibly the situation might be different in la@xmath42sr@xmath43cuo@xmath44 , where the optical gap and the nmr  gap appear to have the same energy scale@xcite , suggesting that either @xmath40 > @xmath5 in this material or that the triplet pair state is not a bound state in this material .    in underdoped ybco , at @xmath7",
    "there is no anomaly in either the qp relaxation@xcite or the nmr k@xmath45 .",
    "similarly the spns intensity at 34 mev shows no anomaly at @xmath7 itself , but only a gradual drop with increasing @xmath6 . from this",
    "we can deduce that there is no change in the dos at @xmath7 in the underdoped state , and that all changes of the dos are gradual with @xmath6 .",
    "this is equivalent to there being no condensation energy associated with the superconducting transition itself which is consistent with the bose condensation of local pairs scenario , where at @xmath7 macrosopic phase coherence is established with no change in pairing amplitude .",
    "a 3d superconducting state forms when phase coherence percolates through the entire sample resulting in a transition to a coherent macroscopic state at @xmath7 .",
    "in contrast , in optimally doped and overdoped ybco as the carrier density increases , the pairs begin to overlap , collective effects become important and a transition to a more conventional bcs - like scenario takes place@xcite .",
    "qp relaxation , nmr k@xmath22 , spns and tunneling data all show an abrupt anomaly at @xmath7 signifying that pairing and phase cohrence occur at the same ( or nearly the same ) temperature .",
    "the most important feature of the qp relaxation data not available from other spectroscopies is the simultaneous unambiguous observation of 2 gaps in optimally doped and overdoped samples , one _ t - independent _ @xmath36 and the other _ t - dependent _",
    "@xmath15 , with a bcs - like _ t _ dependence .",
