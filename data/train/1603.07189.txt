    "information on the stellar rotation period , especially when combined with information on stellar radius and projected rotational velocity ( @xmath1 ) , provides a powerful tool to better understand the nature and evolution stage of low - mass stars .",
    "once the rotation period of a low - mass field star is known , we can estimate its age through the gyro - chronology technique ( see , e.g. , barnes 2007 ) , or , more generally , we can put some constraint on its age .",
    "the rotation period contributes to assess the membership of a star to a given stellar cluster , association , or moving group ( see , e.g. , messina et al .",
    "moreover , when a star has a companion in a close orbit , the rotation period allows us to shed light on the early stage of its stellar evolution , specifically on the primordial disc lifetime .",
    "in fact , the faster rotation that we observe in a close binary with respect to an equal - mass single star reveals that gravitational effects have enhanced the disc dispersal , and shortened the disc - locking duration ( see , e.g. , messina et al .",
    "2014 , 2015a , 2016a ) .",
    "the rotation period combined with the @xmath1 can put constraints on the value of the stellar radius since the inclination of the stellar rotation axis must be @xmath2 .",
    "this constraint allows to investigate , for example , the issue of radius inflation on active stars ( see , e.g. , messina et al .",
    "as well , the knowledge of the rotation period allows to interpret more accurately the observed dispersion in the li distribution among members of clusters / associations .",
    "in fact , rotation has effects on the li content making fast rotators li richer with respect to equal - mass slow rotators ( see , e.g. , soderblom 1993 ; messina et al .",
    "finally , the knowledge of the rotation period of low - mass stars allows to model the apparent radial velocity ( rv ) variations produced by magnetic activity and to remove them in the rv search for planetary companions ( lanza et al .",
    "+ in the present paper , we present the results of an ongoing study aimed at measuring the rotation periods of low - mass stars that are members or candidate members of stellar associations ( messina et al .",

    "the asas data did not provide any significant periodicity .",
    "for these reasons , we decided to plan our own photometric monitoring .",
    "we observed gj3039 at montcabrer observatory in spain ( mo , @xmath23n , @xmath24e , 100 m a.s.l . ) in 2014 , from october 17 to november 17 for a total of 16 nights .",

    "the a and b component of gj3039 were spatially unresolved .",
    "the data reduction was performed using the iraf tasks within daophot .",
    "after dark and bias subtraction , and flat field correction of the science frames , we extracted the v , r , and i magnitudes time series of gj3039 and other stars in the vicinity to search for suitable comparison stars .",
    "these magnitude time series were obtained using the aperture photometry , and were subsequently cleaned by applying a 3@xmath26 threshold to remove outliers .",
    "we could identify one bright ( hd2934 ) and four fainter stars whose light curves were found to be very stable ( @xmath27 0.008 mag ) during the whole observation run and then well suited to be used as comparison and check stars .",
    "differential magnitudes of gj3039 were obtained with respect to the star hd2934 ( ra = 00:32:43.49 , dec = + 07:35:24.98 , j2000.0 , v = 9.26mag , r = 8.8mag , i = 8.4mag ) .",
    "for the subsequent period search , consecutive magnitudes collected within a time interval of 30 min ( about 67 consecutive measurements ) were averaged . that allowed us to have a better estimate of the achieved photometric precisions , which turned to be : @xmath28 = 0.023mag , @xmath29 = 0.006mag , @xmath30 = 0.003mag .",
    "we could observe gj3039 also at the aryabhatta research institute of observational sciences ( aries , @xmath31n , @xmath32e , manora peak , nainital , india ) in three nights , november 27 , 28 and december 26 , 2014 .",

    "runs , at mo and at aries , the small 0.@xmath879 angular separation between the components of gj3039 did not allow us to spatially resolve them .",
    "therefore , the observed magnitudes refer to the unresolved system .",
    "gj3039 was included in gershberg et al .",
    "( 1999 ) catalogue that lists uv cet stars and related objects .",
    "actually , detection of flares in this system was never reported in the literature . a very interesting result of our photometric monitoring was the discovery that gj3039 during two nights exhibited such sudden brightenings that can be interpreted as flare events .",
    "these events , detected at mo on october 17 ( hjd = 2456951.50 ) and november 16 2014 ( hjd = 2456978.47 ) ( fig.1 ) , exhibit the typical shape of a micro - flare with a quick magnitude brightening ( larger than @xmath36r = 0.05mag the first and @xmath36r = 0.04mag the last ) followed by a less rapid exponential - type decrease to the quiet state , and lasting not more than 3045 min .",
    "the brightest magnitude is significantly different , at 4.5@xmath26 level , from the quiet state .",
    "however , we have observations in only one band and other events were not detected .",
    "therefore , we consider those as possible micro - flares .",
    "we note that both flares were detected in correspondence of the phases of light curve minimum , i.e. when spots are best visible , in both components : @xmath37 = 0.60 and 0.78 for component a , and @xmath37 = 0.38 and 0.39 for component b ( see next section ) .",
    "we used the lomb - scargle ( ls ; scargle 1982 ) and clean ( roberts et al .",
    "1987 ) periodogram analyses to search for the rotation periods of the components of gj3039 .",
    "+ the photometric precision of asas archive data of gj3039 is quite low ( @xmath28 = 0.030 mag ) . from the periodogram analysis of asas data we did not infer any rotation period with false alarm probanbility fap @xmath38 1% .",
    "the false alarm probability , that is the probability that a power peak of that height simply arises from gaussian noise in the data , was estimated using a monte - carlo method , i.e. , by generating 1000 artificial light curves obtained from the real one , keeping the date but scrambling the magnitude values ( see , e.g. , herbst et al . 2000 ) .",
    "+ the photometric precision of nsvs archive data of gj3039 is better ( @xmath28 = 0.014 mag ) . from the periodogram analysis of nsvs data , we inferred one power peak at p = 0.909@xmath190.020d ( see fig.2 ) with a confidence level of 95% .",
    "however , this level is smaller than the typical 99% adopted in our previous similar studies ( see , e.g. , messina et al .",
    "therefore , we planned our own observations to confirm it and to search for the rotation period of the other component .",
    "+ the ls analysis of our new photometry revealed a number of highly significant ( fap @xmath381% ) power peaks in the periodogram of the r - magnitude time series .",
    "the two major power peaks correspond to the rotation periods p = 3.355@xmath190.008d and p = 0.925@xmath190.005d .",
    "most secondary power peaks in the ls periodogram ( top - middle panel of fig.3 ) are related to the beating between the primary periods and the 1-d sampling imposed by the earth rotation and the fixed longitude of the observation site .",
    "the clean algorithm effectively removed such beat periods leaving only two significant peaks ( top - right panel of fig.3 ) at the same rotation periods detected by ls .",
    "the normalized power corresponding to a fap = 1% was p@xmath39 = 11 ( dashed horizontal line ) .",
    "the uncertainties of the rotation periods are computed following the prescription of lamm et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .    as mentioned",
    ", the small 0.@xmath879 angular separation between the components of gj3039 did not allow us to spatially resolve them , therefore , we obtained integrated magnitudes . however , since the components have comparable brightness ( see sect.2 ) we expect that both components can significantly contribute to the observed variability , leaving signs of their rotation periods in the time series light modulation . therefore , once we identified the primary period p = 3.355d , we filtered it out from the magnitude time series and recomputed the periodograms .",
    "as shown in fig.4 , we recovered the other highly significant period p = 0.925@xmath190.005d , which is in agreement , within the uncertainties , with the rotation period inferred from the nsvs data . therefore , we conclude that both components of gj3039 are variable and their rotation periods are p = 3.355@xmath190.008d and p = 0.925@xmath190.005d .",
    "we note that in both components the differential color variation @xmath36(v@xmath3i ) is positively correlated to the differential @xmath36r magnitude variation : the star is redder when it is fainter .",
    "this is the kind of correlation observed in spotted star , when the photometric variability arises from the presence of spotted regions , either cooler or warmer than the unperturbed photosphere , unevenly distributed across the stellar longitudes .",
    "the brightest observed magnitude for the unresolved system is v = 12.68mag , as inferred from the long asas time series . in the case that both components have same brightness , the correction for duplicity is @xmath36v = 0.72mag .",
    "however , from the near - infrared magnitude measurements by mccarthy et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , we infer that one component should be fainter than the other and the correction to apply should be @xmath36v @xmath38 0.72mag . in the following analysis we use a weighted average for the projected rotational velocity @xmath40 = 17.0kms@xmath4 .",
    "we use the bolometric corrections bc@xmath41 = @xmath32.43mag and effective temperatures t = 3160k corresponding to a m4 spectral type , according to pecaut & mamajek ( 2013 ) . combining projected rotational velocity , rotation period , and stellar radius , we can constraint the value for the inclination @xmath42 of the rotation axis .",
    "+ the brighter m4 component of the system may have either p = 3.355d or p = 0.925d as rotation period .",
    "+ let us explore the first possibility , that is p = 3.355d is the rotation period of the brighter a component .",
    "in order to have @xmath43 we need that r@xmath44r@xmath45 .",
    "such values of stellar radii can be obtained if the bolometric magnitude is m@xmath46mag .",
    "again , such range of values can be obtained imposing that v@xmath12@xmath35@xmath47(d ) @xmath48 4.53 .",
    "since the observed magnitude must be 12.68 @xmath48 v @xmath48 13.4mag , consequently we get 43 @xmath48 d @xmath48 59pc .",
    "this range of distance partly overlaps , within the uncertainties , with the kinematic distance d = 41.1@xmath194.4pc inferred by schlieder et al .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to attribute the rotation period p = 3.355d to the brighter a component of gj3039 .",
    "for instance , either for fainter magnitudes or larger distances ( within the mentioned ranges ) we will get lower values of the inclination of the rotational axis .",
    "+ the second possibility is that p = 0.925d is the rotation period of the brighter a component .",
    "following the same reasoning , in order to be 0.4 @xmath49 we need 0.3 @xmath48 r@xmath50r@xmath45 .",
    "we note that very low values of the inclination ( @xmath51 ) in combination with the light dilution effect owing to the unresolved photometry , would prevent any light rotational modulation , which is not our case .",
    "the stellar radius is within such range of values if the bolometric magnitude is 8.4 @xmath48 m@xmath52mag .",
    "again , such range of values can be obtained imposing that 5.8 @xmath48 v@xmath12@xmath35@xmath47(d ) @xmath48 7.3 .",
    "this constraint can be respected if we use either v @xmath53 13.8mag or 12 @xmath48 d @xmath48 33pc .",
    "the first is a magnitude too faint even if the correction for duplicity is applied , and the second is outside the kinematic distance d = 41.1@xmath194.4pc inferred by schlieder et al .",
    "+ on the basis on this considerations , we can state that gj3039a has a rotation period p@xmath12 = 3.355d , and an inclination of its rotation axis @xmath42@xmath1090@xmath11 , and gj3039b has a rotation period p@xmath13 = 0.925d .",
    "+ once we have attributed the rotation periods to the respective components , we can try to investigate if the two components are or are not physically bound .",
    "in fact , for the secondary component of this system , as far as we have found in the literature , we have no measurements of distance , space velocity components , rv , proper motion .",
    "therefore , it may be a physical companion , but also either a foreground or a background star . to investigate this issue",
    "we can use the available near - infrared photometry .",

    "<S> we have carried out a multi - band photometric monitoring of the close visual binary gj3039 , consisting of a m4 primary and a fainter secondary component , and likely member of the young stellar association @xmath0 pictoris ( 24-myr old ) . from our analysis </S>",
    "<S> we found that both components are photometric variables and , for the first time , we detected two micro - flare events . </S>",
    "<S> we measured from periodogram analysis of the photometric time series two rotation periods p = 3.355d and p = 0.925d , that we could attribute to the brighter gj3039a and the fainter gj3039b components , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of these rotation periods with the period distribution of other @xmath0 pictoris members further supports that gj3039a is a member of this association . </S>",
    "<S> we find that also gj3039b could be a member , but the infrared magnitude differences between the two components taken from the literature and the photometric variability , which is found to be comparable in both stars , suggest that gj3039b could be a foreground star physically unbound to the primary a component </S>",
