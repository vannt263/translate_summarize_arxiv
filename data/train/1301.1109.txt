    "we investigate the basis of black hole thermodynamics in order to search for universal properties of quantum gravity , where `` universal '' means the independence from any existing model of quantum gravity .",
    "the basic concept of black hole thermodynamics is as follows : _ because a stationary black hole emits the thermal radiation ( hawking radiation ) , the black hole is in a thermal equilibrium state of gravity . and ,",
    "usually , the micro - scopic origin of black hole is expected to be the quantum states of gravity .",
    "_ this concept depends on the thermal radiation theory which indicates that the source of `` planck spectrum '' is a thermal equilibrium object .    by accepting the black hole thermodynamics",
    ", it is reasonable to require that the quantum gravity satisfies the presupposition of thermal radiation theory , otherwise we can not regard black holes as thermal equilibrium states by observing the hawking radiation . here , the presupposition of thermal radiation theory is that the ordinary thermodynamics and quantum statistical mechanics work well on any thermal equilibrium object ( at least in laboratory system ) .",
    "therefore , it is natural to require that _ the basic idea of statistical mechanics is applicable to thermal equilibrium states of not only laboratory systems but also quantum gravity ( black holes)_. here , the basic idea of statistical mechanics is , for example , the boltzmann formula , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the bekenstein - hawking entropy and @xmath2 is the number of states of black hole counted by the underlying quantum gravity .    from the above , we adopt the following two suppositions for our purpose :    a stationary black hole is a thermal equilibrium state composed of micro - states of underlying quantum gravity",
    ".    basic formalism of statistical mechanics ( e.g. boltzmann formula , grand partition function and so on ) is applicable to underlying quantum gravity so as to describe the thermal equilibrium states ( black holes ) .",
    "the issues for each supposition are as follows :    note that , if the boltzmann formula , @xmath0 , holds for black holes , then it defines the bekenstein - hawking entropy @xmath1 _ uniquely _ in micro - scopic point of view .",
    "this means that the boltzmann formula can never work well unless the uniqueness of entropy is proven in macro - scopic point of view of thermodynamics ( independent of any micro - scopic theory )  @xcite . in ordinary thermodynamics , the uniqueness of entropy",
    "is proven by some basic axioms of thermodynamics  @xcite . however , a basic axiom of ordinary thermodynamics do not hold in black hole thermodynamics  @xcite . then",
    ", it is not necessarily manifest whether the entropy @xmath1 is unique or not in black hole thermodynamics .",
    "hence , we have to prove the uniqueness of @xmath1 before the discussion of boltzmann formula ( see sec.[o28 - 13:sec : entropy ] ) .",
    "once the uniqueness of @xmath1 is proven in macro - scopic point of view , we can proceed to discussions on boltzmann formula .",
    "note that the validity of boltzmann formula in ordinary quantum statistical mechanics is justified by some intrinsic properties of hilbert space of ordinary quantum mechanics .",
    "those intrinsic properties appear in ruelle - tasaki theorem and dobrushin theorem  @xcite ( see sec.[o28 - 13:sec : boltzmann ] ) .",
    "_ thus , if @xmath1 is given by the boltzmann formula , we can expect that those theorems of ordinary quantum mechanics are related with some property of underlying quantum gravity .",
    "some universal property of quantum gravity may be extracted from those theorems _ ( see sec.[o28 - 13:sec : conc ] ) .",
    "in the rigorous axiomatic formulation of ordinary thermodynamics  @xcite , the basic axioms consist of not only the `` four laws of thermodynamics '' but also some more requirements .",
    "one of the axioms of ordinary thermodynamics modified in black hole thermodynamics is the classification requirement of state variables ; all thermodynamic state variables are classified into two categories , extensive variables ( e.g. energy , entropy and so on ) and intensive variables ( e.g. temperature , pressure and so on ) .",
    "however , as explained in detail in ref.@xcite , the state variables in black hole thermodynamics can not be classified into the two categories , but classified into _",
    "three _ categories .",
    "hence , various theorems ( including the uniqueness of entropy ) in ordinary thermodynamics , whose proof uses the classification of state variables , should be re - proven in black hole thermodynamics .",
    "ref.@xcite gives an axiomatic proof to the uniqueness of @xmath1 :    uniqueness theorem of entropy : : :    let @xmath3 be an extensive variable which increases along    irreversible adiabatic processes .",
    "then there exist two constants    @xmath4 and @xmath5 such that    @xmath6 , where @xmath1 is the    bekenstein - hawking entropy .",
    "( see ref.@xcite for the proof . )",
    "once this theorem is proven , we can proceed to discussions on boltzmann formula . in this sense",
    ", we can regard the conclusion in sec.[o28 - 13:sec : conc ] as a result implied by the uniqueness of @xmath1 .",
    "consider the ordinary quantum mechanics in this section . for simplicity , consider the system of @xmath7 identical particles in a region of volume @xmath8 with no external field , and :",
    "@xmath9 , where @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( `` @xmath14 '' for degeneracy ) .",
    "@xmath15 `` number of eigen states satisfying @xmath16 '' @xmath17 .    for the first ,",
    "let us show the ruelle - tasaki theorem which clarifies the sufficient conditions for the validity of boltzmann formula  @xcite :    ruelle - tasaki theorem : : :    suppose the following two conditions of    @xmath18 :    +    condition  a : ; ;      arbitrary @xmath19-particle interaction ,      @xmath20 , becomes negative for sufficiently large      distribution of @xmath19 particles .",
    "that is , there exists a      constant @xmath21 , such that      @xmath22      for      @xmath23      .",
    "condition  b : ; ;      interaction potential @xmath24 is bounded below .",
    "that is ,      there exists a constant @xmath25 , such that      @xmath26 .",
    "+    then , the limit , @xmath27 , exists uniquely , where    @xmath28 is thermodynamic limit defined by    @xmath29 with fixing @xmath30 and    @xmath31 at constant values .    by this theorem ,",
    "the thermodynamics limit of @xmath32 is defined well .",
    "furthermore , it can be also proven that @xmath33 is concave about its arguments @xmath34 and monotone increasing about @xmath35 , and remains constant along _ reversible _ adiabatic processes  @xcite .",
    "these behaviors are some characteristic properties of entropy already known in thermodynamics .",
    "then , in statistical mechanics , it is assumed that @xmath32 is equal to the entropy ( the boltzmann formula ) .",
    "obviously , the above conditions  a and  b are the sufficient conditions for the validity of boltzmann formula .",
    "furthermore , a system , which holds boltzmann formula but violates conditions  a or  b , has not been found experimentally .",
    "_ hence , at least in laboratory systems , it is reasonable to require that any physical system satisfies the conditions  a and  b. _    next , let us show the dobrushin theorem which clarifies the necessary condition for the existence of thermal equilibrium states  @xcite :    dobrushin theorem : : :    consider the case satisfying following two presuppositions :    +    presupposition  c : ; ;      the @xmath36-particle interactions disappear , and the      total interaction potential is a sum of two - particle interactions ,      @xmath37 .",
    "presupposition  d : ; ;      @xmath38      ( @xmath39 ) for sufficiently large      @xmath40 .",
    "+    under these presuppositions , if the ground partition function can be    defined uniquely ( i.e. if thermal equilibrium states exist ) , then the    following inequality holds , @xmath41    obviously , @xmath42 is the necessary condition for the existence of thermal equilibrium states .",
    "note that the presuppositions  c and  d are natural when we consider the gravity .",
    "our supposition  2 in sec.[o28 - 13:sec : intro ] implies that the ordinary quantum mechanics and quantum gravity share the same properties which justify the boltzmann formula and existence of thermal equilibrium states .",
    "the sufficient conditions  a , b and the necessary condition @xmath42 are expected to be such shared properties  .",
    "the typical form of the potential is shown in fig.[fig:1 ] .",
    "note that , these three conditions ( a , b and @xmath43 ) are for the interaction potential .",
    "on the other hand , it is not clear whether the full quantum gravity is described by using the interaction potential @xmath24 or hamiltonian ( or lagrangian ) .",
    "however , it seems to be certain that a semi - classical expression of quantum gravity is described by an effective field equation of spacetime metric ( with some auxiliary field if needed ) .",
    "hence , our suggestion is as follows :    implication from the above : : :    if the effective field equation of quantum gravity at semi - classical    level is described by a correction term @xmath44 added    to einstein equation such as @xmath45    ( where @xmath46 is the energy - momentum tensor ,    @xmath47 the metric , @xmath48 the    ricci tensor , and @xmath49 ) , then    @xmath44 should generate the repulsive gravity at    short ( e.g. planck ) length scale , and a necessary property of    @xmath44 is given in eq.([eq : conc.f ] ) below .",
    "let us note that the raychaudhuri equation holds for arbitrary timelike / null congruence in arbitrary spacetime . for simplicity",
    ", consider the local hypersurface orthogonal ( i.e. vanishing vorticity ) geodesic congruence . then",
    ", the raychaudhuri equation becomes , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the affine parameter , @xmath52 the tangent of geodesic , @xmath53 is the expansion ( the rate of change of sectional area of congruence , d[area]@xmath54 ) , @xmath55 the square of shear tensor , and @xmath56 or @xmath57 for respectively timelike or null geodesics .",
    "note that , in the general relativity ( @xmath58 ) , the so - called _ energy condition _ ( e.g. the null energy condition , @xmath59 for arbitrary null vector @xmath52 ) gives @xmath60 by the einstein equation and results in @xmath61 by the raychaudhuri equation , which indicates the attractive nature of gravity . on one hand ,",
    "if there arises a case of @xmath62 , then @xmath63 may hold by the raychaudhuri equation , which is regarded as a necessary condition of repulsive gravity .    then",
    ", when we require the repulsive gravity in planck length scale , the correction term @xmath44 should give the inequality @xmath62 in planck length scale . here , by eq.([eq",
    ": conc.eom ] ) , we find , @xmath64   + \\bigl[\\ , f_{\\mu\\nu}u^{\\mu}u^{\\nu } - ( 1/2 ) f\\,u^2 \\,\\bigr]$ ] , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
