    "the distinct feature of highly frustrated magnetic materials is a peculiar spatial arrangement of the magnetic ions .",
    "antiferromagnets on typical geometrically frustrated structures , like , for instance , kagome , garnet , and pyrochlore lattices , have an infinite number of classical ground states .",
    "this macroscopic degeneracy precludes any type of conventional magnetic ordering . as a result ,",
    "frustrated magnets remain in a disordered cooperative paramagnetic ground state at temperatures well below the paramagnetic curie - weiss constant @xmath2.@xcite weak residual interactions or quantum and thermal fluctuations usually induce some kind of ordered or spin - glass state at @xmath3 .",
    "a number of geometrically frustrated magnets have been experimentally studied in the past decade.@xcite magnetic pyrochlore compound @xmath0  is one of the prototype examples .",
    "the gd@xmath4 ions have spin @xmath5 and zero orbital momentum , which yields a good realization of a nearest - neighbor heisenberg exchange antiferromagnet on a pyrochlore lattice .",
    "recent specific heat , susceptibility and neutron scattering measurements @xcite have shown that @xmath0  remains disordered over a wide temperature interval below its @xmath6  k. the transition to an ordered phase is presumably driven by weak dipole - dipole interactions and occurs only at @xmath7  k.    infinite degeneracy of the magnetic ground state of a frustrated magnet implies the presence of a macroscopic number of local zero - energy modes .",
    "such soft modes correspond to rotational degrees of freedom of a finite number of spins with no change in the total exchange energy . in a pyrochlore structure ( a matrix of corner - sharing tetrahedra on the fcc lattice ) , these groups of spins are hexagons formed by the edges of neighboring tetrahedra , which lie in the kagome planes [ ( 111 ) and equivalent planes ] ( see _ e.g. _ ref .  ) . in zero",
    "applied field , if the six spins are arranged antiferromagnetically around one hexagon , they effectively decouple from the other spins and can rotate by an arbitrary angle .",
    "the low - energy hexagon modes have been observed in quasielastic neutron scattering studies on spinel compound zncr@xmath8o@xmath9 , which is a spin-3/2 heisenberg antiferromagnet on a pyrochlore lattice.@xcite the thermodynamic consequence of these local excitations is that a considerable fraction of the magnetic entropy is not frozen down to temperatures much less than @xmath2 .",
    "an interesting effect related to a field evolution of the zero - energy local modes is an enhanced magnetocaloric effect near the saturation field @xmath10 predicted in ref .  .",
    "transformation between a nondegenerate fully polarized spin state above @xmath10 and an infinitely degenerate magnetic state below @xmath10 occurs via condensation of a macroscopic number of local modes and produces large changes of entropy in magnetic field .",
    "quantum fluctuations do not destroy such an effect.@xcite in particular , at @xmath11 geometrically frustrated magnets on pyrochlore and kagome lattices have a finite macroscopic entropy , which does not depend on the value of the spin of the magnetic ions .",
    "the finite entropy of kagome antiferromagnet has been calculated exactly,@xcite whereas the corresponding quantity for a pyrochlore lattice remains unknown .",
    "therefore , an experimental observation of the magnetocaloric effect in @xmath0  should be important both from a fundamental point of view , as a physical probe of the local zero - energy excitations in the frustrated ground state below @xmath10 , and because of the possible technological applications .",
    "the enhanced magnetic cooling power of gadolinium gallium garnet @xmath1  has been known for a long time , @xcite although without reference to the frustrated nature of a garnet ( hyper - kagome ) lattice .",
    "experiments have been also performed on other garnets.@xcite thus , a comparison between the two typical frustrated magnets is important since a stronger frustration on a pyrochlore lattice produces the maximal cooling rate among all known types of geometrically frustrated magnets.@xcite in the present work we study experimentally and theoretically the magnetocaloric effect in @xmath0 .",

    "entropy variations and the cooling power of @xmath0  in an applied magnetic field are calculated from a combination of the adiabatic demagnetization results and specific heat measurements .",

    ", we present the results of specific heat measurements of @xmath0  performed in a quantum design ppms calorimeter at zero field and at @xmath14  koe ( see fig .",

    "the curve at @xmath15 was taken from our previous work in ref .",
    "while the high field data were measured in the temperature range from 1.5 to 20  k. instead of two sharp peaks on a zero field @xmath16 dependence at @xmath17 k and @xmath18 k corresponding to the ordering phase transitions , the high field curve demonstrates a broad maximum around 56 k. the lattice contribution to the specific heat extracted by fitting the zero field data at temperatures 3070 k in the debye approximation is shown in the figure by a dashed line .",
    "the temperature dependence of the magnetic entropy ( total entropy with the phonon part subtracted ) obtained by integrating @xmath19 curves are presented at the lower panel of fig .",
    "1 . they give a general overview of the magnetocaloric effect in this compound .",
    "an adiabatic demagnetization of the system down to zero field starting at @xmath14 koe and @xmath20 k ( around @xmath2 ) results in decreasing temperature to 2 k , while the isothermal process at @xmath21 k is accompanied by an entropy increase by approximately one half of the total magnetic entropy .",

    "koe was glued onto the sample .",
    "it was also used as a heater to regulate the starting temperature of the experiment .",
    "the sample was suspended on four thin constantan wires ( @xmath24 m in diameter and 5  cm in length ) soldered to the thermometer to make a 4-wire resistance measurement .",
    "the experimental cell was put in a vacuum can immersed in a helium bath held at 1.84.2  k. the heat exchange gas inside the can was absorbed by a charcoal cryopump to a pressure of @xmath25  torr .",
    "the cryopump was equipped with a heater to desorb some exchange gas when necessary to cool the sample during the experiment .",
    "magnetic fields up to 120  koe were generated by a superconducting magnet .",
    "the field @xmath26 was applied perpendicular to the @xmath27 axis .",
    "no correction for the demagnetization factor was made .",
    "the measurements were done at a sweep rate of 10  koe / min .    for various starting temperatures ;",
    "dotted lines represent the corrections for the lattice heat capacity ( see discussion ) .",
    "solid lines are obtained by monte carlo simulations with the exchange constant @xmath28  k. ]    the temperature versus magnetic field curves for different starting temperatures are shown in fig .",
    "the temperature drop on demagnetization @xmath29 depends on the starting temperature .",
    "it has a maximum around @xmath30  k where the temperature drops by a factor of 10 .",
    "a characteristic feature for all the @xmath31 curves starting below 10  k is that a great deal of cooling occurs in the field range from 120 to 60  koe , which contrasts sharply with a continuous adiabatic cooling ( @xmath32 ) of an ideal paramagnet .",
    "additionally , a parasitic temperature drift @xmath33 ( due to radiation , wiring and the measuring current ) was investigated at several fixed values of the field for temperatures along each curve @xmath31 .",
    "the values of @xmath33 have a smooth temperature dependence within @xmath34 mk / sec changing sign at about 10 k. the experimental data were corrected at each moment of time @xmath35 ( corresponding to each value of the magnetic field @xmath26 ) using a set of measured @xmath33 values by formula @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the raw experimental value , @xmath38 is the corrected temperature .",
    "one should mention , that the above correction procedure is applicable only if the parasitic heating does not strongly affect the whole demagnetization process . in this case , after the correction is applied to the raw data , the process appeared to be fully reversible by the sweep direction , so that the curves obtained on increasing the magnetic field do not differ from those shown in fig .",
    "a more general heat - balance equation @xmath39 ( @xmath40 is a parasitic heat leak ( @xmath41 ) , @xmath42 is the specific heat at a constant field ) leads to formula ( [ tcor ] ) if the function @xmath43 does not change significantly between @xmath44 and @xmath38 .",
    "such an assumption is valid for all the scans shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] except the one starting at @xmath45 k and the corresponding @xmath31 curves are given with the appropriate subtraction .",
    "for the lowest scan , the correction appears to be of the same order of magnitude with the experimental temperature .",
    "in addition , the derivative @xmath46 strongly decreases in the vicinity of the ordering transition which leads to an overcorrection of the experimental data .",
    "this overcorrection is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] by the dashed line .",
    "thus , an ideal adiabatic dependence @xmath31 should lie between the raw experimental data and the corrected curve .",
    "the minimum temperature reached experimentally on demagnetization from @xmath45  k at @xmath47  koe is @xmath48  k. this cooling limit is associated with the magnetic entropy freezing at the transition into an ordered state . when the field is further decreased , a weak temperature increase is observed .",
    "two temperature plateaus ( shown by the arrows in fig .  [ fig3 ] ) are clearly seen in this part of the curve corresponding to the phase transitions at @xmath49 k and @xmath50 k @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to compare the above measurements to the magnetocaloric effect in another frustrated spin system @xmath1 .",
    "the data on @xmath1  have been obtained on a sintered powder sample ( mass 4.05 g ) using an experimental technique similar to that described above . due to the large heat capacity of the sample , no correction for parasitic heat leaks",
    "is required in this case .",
    "the measured adiabatic demagnetization curves for @xmath1  are very similar to the previously published results for oriented single crystals@xcite in the temperature range of overlap .",
    "our results are compared to @xmath0  data in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] on a field scale normalized to the corresponding values of @xmath10 : 15  koe and 70 koe , respectively .",
    "the magnetocaloric effect in the @xmath1  sample is qualitatively similar to what is observed in @xmath0 , but occurs in a different temperature range due to a smaller exchange constant . in a demagnetization process of @xmath1  starting from @xmath51 ( 28 koe ) at",
    "@xmath52  k the temperature decreases by a factor of 5 reaching its minimum value of 0.1  k in the vicinity of the saturation field after which it remains practically constant .",
    "( raw data ) and @xmath1  on a field scale normalized to @xmath10 .",
    "monte carlo simulations are shown by the solid lines ; the dashed line is an overcorrection to the experimental data made using formula ( [ tcor ] ) . ]",
    "our experimental results demonstrate the decisive role of the frustration in producing large adiabatic temperature changes in the two materials . in typical nonfrustrated antiferromagnets ,",
    "magnetocaloric effect in the vicinity of field induced transitions is very small .",
    "for example , adiabatic @xmath53 does not exceed 0.05  k in csni@xmath54fe@xmath55cl@xmath56i for a similar range of fields and temperatures.@xcite for a quantitative description of the above data we have performed a series of monte carlo ( mc ) simulations on classical antiferromagnetic models with only nearest - neighbor exchange .",
    "a detailed account of the application of the mc technique to model adiabatic processes is given in ref .  .",
    "quantum spins @xmath5 are replaced by classical @xmath57-vectors ( @xmath58 ) , an approximation which is valid for high enough temperatures @xmath59 .",
    "the only parameter required to compare the mc simulations to the experimental data is the exchange constant @xmath60 , which is estimated from values of the saturation field or the curie - weiss temperature .",
    "expressions for these quantities for nearest - neighbor antiferromagnets on pyrochlore and garnet lattices are @xmath61 respectively ( see , _ e.g. _ , ref .  ) .",
    "corresponding values for both compounds have been taken from previous works @xcite and are summarized in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "for both materials , the exchange constants derived from @xmath10 and @xmath2 agree to within an accuracy of @xmath62  % .",
    "the remaining difference may be attributed to weaker dipolar and other interactions , which are responsible for the eventual ordering in @xmath0  below @xmath63 and above @xmath64  koe in @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath2 and the estimations of the exchange constants for @xmath0  and @xmath1 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab1 ]    the results of the mc simulations for @xmath0  with @xmath28  k are indicated by the solid lines in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] . for the scans starting at temperatures above 10",
    "k one can not neglect the phonon contribution to the total heat capacity of the sample .",
    "the influence of lattice heat on the demagnetization process can be taken into account using eq .",
    "( [ balance ] ) , which yields the following relationship between the ideal temperature variation @xmath53 and its observed value @xmath65 :    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the phonon part of the specific heat , @xmath42 is its magnetic part . using the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , one can approximately correct the @xmath31 curves for the temperature dependent phonon contribution ( see dotted lines on fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . with this correction ,",
    "the mc calculations demonstrate very good agreement with the experiment in the whole temperature range at fields above @xmath10 .",
    "since a nearest - neighbor heisenberg pyrochlore antiferromagnet does not order , the mc simulations can not describe satisfactorily the observed behavior below @xmath10 at @xmath68  k. besides , this is also the limit of the validity of the classical approximation : @xmath69  k. the temperature increase at @xmath70 observed in @xmath0  ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) may be attributed to the reopening of a gap in the excitation spectrum below @xmath10 caused by anisotropic interactions .",
    "the theoretical dependence obtained for @xmath1  ( lower solid line in fig .  [ fig3 ] ) with the exchange constant @xmath71  k also fits the high field part of the experimental adiabatic curve very well .    under isothermal demagnetization from @xmath72  koe to @xmath73 at different temperatures .",
    "entropy variations of an ideal @xmath5 paramagnet under the same conditions are shown by the dashed lines .",
    "the inset represents the critical intersection line of the two surfaces .",
    "]    finally , we estimate the cooling power of the demagnetization process using the measured adiabatic @xmath31 curves along with the specific heat data @xmath16 obtained at high fields . the amount of heat absorbed by a magnetic material during isothermal demagnetization is related to the entropy change @xmath74 .",
    "consider an adiabatic demagnetization curve , which starts at @xmath75 and ends at @xmath76 .",
    "the entropy along the curve @xmath31 remains constant , so we can relate the entropy variations at constant temperature and in constant field :",
    "@xmath77    the entropy changes @xmath78 of @xmath0  under the isothermal demagnetization at various temperatures from the initial field @xmath72 koe as a function of the final field @xmath73 are presented by closed circles in fig .  [ cool ] .",
    "the values of @xmath78 are calculated from our experimental data using the above equation , while the real entropy of the system remains undefined .",
    "two features should be underlined : ( i ) about one half of the total magnetic entropy @xmath79 remains in the system even at temperatures very close to the transition into an ordered state at @xmath17 k ; ( ii ) the largest entropy change @xmath78 and consequently , a heat absorption @xmath80 occurs in a high field region above @xmath10 .",
    "this differs significantly from the behavior of an ideal paramagnet at low temperatures ( shown by grey surface on fig .",
    "[ cool ] ) , which releases a significant part of its entropy only if demagnetized to @xmath81 .",
    "this figure demonstrates that @xmath0  has a considerable advantage below 5  k in the _ high field _",
    "cooling power over conventional paramagnets .",
    "the boundary of the field - temperature area where the pyrochlore is advantageous over an ideal @xmath5 paramagnet obtained as an intersection of the two sheets ( the bold line ) is shown in the inset to fig .",
    "[ cool ] . for comparison",
    ", we performed similar mc simulations of a nearest - neighbor antiferromagnet ( not shown in the graph ) .",
    "classical models can not give correct values for the total entropy of a quantum spin system .",
    "nevertheless , the variation of entropy is reproduced with a remarkable accuracy .",
    "for example , the calculated values of @xmath78 at @xmath82 k for demagnetization from @xmath72 koe to zero field and to @xmath83 koe are 0.52 and 0.40 of the total magnetic entropy respectively .",
    "the difference from the experiment does not exceed 20% , which is due to the large @xmath5 spin of the gd@xmath4 ions .",
    "the cooling power @xmath80 has a maximum around 4  k reaching 30  j / mole gd .",
    "such an amount of heat corresponds , for comparison , to the evaporation heat of approximately one mole of liquid @xmath13he at @xmath84  k. the garnet compound @xmath1  is also advantageous as a refrigerant material over paramagnetic salts , but at lower fields and temperatures .",
    "we suggest that a combination of the two compounds might become the basis for a inexpensive two - stage adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator suitable for effective cooling from @xmath85  k down to 100 mk range in a single field sweep .",
    "in conclusion , a large magnetocaloric effect is observed in the frustrated pyrochlore antiferromagnet @xmath0  in agreement with recent theoretical predictions.@xcite this observation points at the presence of a macroscopic number of local low - energy excitations in the vicinity of @xmath10 .",
    "such modes can be directly probed in quasielastic neutron scattering measurements analogously to the experiment on zncr@xmath8o@xmath9.@xcite these excitations may also be responsible for the nonfrozen spin dynamics below @xmath63 observed in @xmath0  by muon spin relaxation measurements .",
    "@xcite a comparison between our experimental data and classical mc simulations shows that this numerical technique can semiquantitatively predict the magnetocaloric properties of real rare - earth materials with large ( semiclassical ) magnetic moments , which have been described so far only in the molecular field approximation .",
