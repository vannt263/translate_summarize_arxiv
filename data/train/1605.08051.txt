    "in particular , five of our runs in the latter series employ the `` unified '' agn model presented in @xcite . here , we use the mechanical outflow power as the source of energy for our kinetic feedback , and _ build an improved form of unified agn feedback model_.    our main results are :    * bipolar bubble - like outflows form , originating from the bh , and propagating radially outward to a distance of a few @xmath3 kpc .",

    "the output bh power @xmath51 erg / s heats up the cool core in the runs where the kicked particles are always hydrodynamically coupled .",
    "wind particles decoupled from hydrodynamics do not have any heating effect at the center , unless the power is increased by a factor of @xmath12 .",
    "bh feedback is less efficient in two runs ( one with a lower bh power ) where the initial cool core remains . *",
    "when allowing the bh to grow , the bh accretion rate has a power - law increase , to reach a peak of few times @xmath253/yr ( values depending on the feedback model ) .",
    "after the peak , the @xmath184 reduces @xmath254 times in the runs with kinetic feedback and remains almost constant with thermal feedback . * the total star formation rate increases with time initially ; then the growing bh accretes in , heats up , and ejects out some central gas , quenching sf .",
    "the sfr is reduced @xmath143 times with thermal , and @xmath3 times by kinetic feedback . _",
    "thus , kinetic feedback is more efficient in quenching the sfr . _",
    "the same is true for the inner cool gas mass . *",
    "kinetic feedback is more effective and has a stronger impact on the cluster central gas than thermal feedback using the same feedback efficiency , within our implementation of star - formation model . *",
    "the inclusion of _ cold gas accretion _ in the simulations with bh growth shows huge variability of the @xmath184 and inner cool / hot gas masses , thus _",
    "produces naturally a duty cycle of the agn with a periodicity of @xmath3 myr_. * the unified feedback model , where we use our kinetic scheme to distribute the mechanical agn power , is basically as good as the pure kinetic one in quenching the sfr , heating the cool core and raising its central entropy level .",
    "we emphasize again that the same result can not be obtained using purely thermal feedback .",
    "in this paper we have presented an implementation of agn feedback in the kinetic form in an sph code .",
    "the results presented here further demonstrate the relevance of explicitly describing the mechanical nature of the radio - mode agn feedback to create a self - regulated cooling - heating cycle in the core regions of isolated halos having the size of a galaxy cluster .",
