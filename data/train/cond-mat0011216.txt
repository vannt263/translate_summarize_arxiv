    "since its inception nearly forty years ago , the anderson impurity model ( aim ) @xcite has become one of the generic models of correlated electron physics , permitting at possibly the simplest level a detailed study of the competition between local interactions and electron itinerancy . the great majority of previous work , reviewed comprehensively in ref .  ,",
    "has focused on an impurity coupled to a conduction band whose width ( @xmath0 ) represents a large energy scale  large compared to the one - electron hybridization strength ( @xmath1 ) that characterizes the host / impurity coupling .",
    "the opposite extreme of a _ narrow - band _ aim has however been invoked @xcite in relation to the hubbard model in large dimensions @xcite , where the correlated lattice problem maps onto an effective impurity model coupled to a self - consistently determined bath @xcite . here , in the vicinity of the mott transition occurring in the particle - hole symmetric ( @xmath9-filled ) hubbard model , an effective narrow - band aim is generated self - consistently in the now widely accepted scenario for the transition @xcite that arose originally from the iterated perturbation theory ( ipt ) approach of kotliar , georges and coworkers @xcite .",
    "recently hofstetter and kehrein @xcite have undertaken a numerical study of the symmetric narrow - band aim , freed from the additional complications of self - consistency and itself defined by @xmath10 .",
    "thermodynamic and spectral properties of the model were found thereby to exhibit a range of behaviour that is quite distinct from the conventional @xcite wide - band aim .",
    "single - particle spectra for example , determined via finite - size lanczos calculations , show a much richer structure than their wide - band counterpart . at low frequencies in particular they exhibit an intricate competition between various physical effects and their associated energy scales , reflecting ultimately the importance in the narrow - band aim of an energy scale @xmath11 that while large compared to the host bandwidth @xmath0 is typically small compared to the on - site interaction @xmath2 .",
    "spectral properties of the narrow - band aim are discussed in the present paper , a complementary analytical study based in part upon 2nd order perturbation theory ( 2pt ) in @xmath2 .",
    "this is found to provide a qualitatively correct description on all energy scales , suggests a simple physical interpretation of the most prominent spectral features , and produces rather good agreement with the lanczos results of hofstetter and kehrein @xcite .",
    "we also show , independent of the intrinsic limitations of 2pt , that spectral behaviour divides into two distinct regimes that are borne out by the calculations of ref .  : ( a ) weak - coupling for @xmath12 ( with @xmath5 the quasi - particle weight ) , and ( b ) a strong coupling ( kondo ) regime for @xmath13 .    for the weak to moderate interaction strengths reliably accessible by lanczos calculations , hofstetter and kehrein @xcite have shown that pole contributions to the interaction self - energy @xmath6 , occurring on the scale @xmath11 , are an integral facet of the narrow - band aim ; but that they can not be captured to any order in a skeleton expansion . within 2pt",
    ", @xmath8 is indeed found to be dominated entirely by poles on this order .",
    "however in strong coupling @xmath14 , 2pt will certainly be qualitatively deficient on the lowest energy scales @xmath15 characteristic of the kondo resonance .",
    "we show nonetheless that in strong coupling the pole contributions to the self - energy are again given _",
    "precisely _ by the result arising from 2pt .",
    "these poles are thus a ubiquitously dominant and essentially @xmath2-independent characteristic of the narrow - band aim .",
    "they are moreover continuously connected to the atomic limit of the model , which sheds light on the inability of a skeleton expansion to recover them , and points to the intrinsic dangers of partial infinite - order summations based on pt in @xmath2 .",
    "the hamiltonian for the aim is given in standard notation by @xmath16 where the first term describes electrons ( of spin @xmath17 ) in a metallic host band of dispersion @xmath18 .",
    "the following two terms refer to the impurity , with @xmath19 the impurity level and @xmath2 the on - site coulomb interaction .",
    "the final term describes the one - electron hybridization between the impurity and host . throughout this article , as in ref .  , we study the particle - hole symmetric aim where @xmath20 . in this case , for all interaction strengths , the fermi level remains fixed at its non - interacting value and the impurity charge @xmath21 ; single - particle spectra are thus symmetric with respect to the fermi level , @xmath22 .",
    "we first consider briefly the noninteracting problem @xmath23 which , although rather trivial by itself , generates two inherent energy scales that control the subsequent evolution of single - particle properties with interaction strength . for @xmath24 the ( causal ) single - particle impurity green function @xmath25 is given by @xcite @xmath26^{-1}\\ ] ] with @xmath27 and @xmath28 the hybridization function , @xmath29 .",
    "we are interested in the _ narrow - band case _ , meaning @xmath30 with @xmath0 the host bandwidth .",
    "the physics of the model is naturally rather insensitive to the precise form of the hybridization . we thus take @xmath31 to consist of a single flat band of intensity @xmath1 , ranging from @xmath32 to @xmath33 ; so that in total @xmath34 where @xmath35 follows via hilbert transformation",
    ".    the noninteracting single - particle spectrum consists of two contributions : ( i ) a low - energy continuum for @xmath36 $ ] , arising from the non - zero imaginary part of the hybridization ; ( ii ) two poles , one lying above and the other one symmetrically below the continuum .",
    "the fraction of spectral weight residing in the poles depends strongly on the bandwidth of the host metal . in the usual wide - band model , @xmath37 ,",
    "most of the spectral weight is concentrated in the single - particle band , while the poles are exponentially weak and hence irrelevant in practice .",
    "the situation is however radically different in the present narrow - band model , defined by @xmath38 . here",
    "the poles are the most prominent features of the spectrum , suggesting that the narrow host behaves in effect as a single site or level @xcite . as this `` host site '' is coupled to the impurity , a bonding and an anti - bonding orbital form in analogy to the @xmath39 molecule .",
    "these orbitals occur at frequencies @xmath40 far outside the band , obtained by expanding @xmath41 in the denominator of ( [ gfree ] ) to yield @xmath42 the pole - weight of each orbital is @xmath43 , showing that they carry almost the entire spectral density .",
    "the noninteracting single - particle spectrum is thus characterized by a weak continuum of weight @xmath44 , ranging over the lowest energy scale @xmath45 , and two molecular orbitals carrying most of the spectral intensity .",
    "the latter occur at the orbital bonding energy @xmath46 which , although much larger than @xmath0 , defines a second low - energy scale @xmath47 .",
    "central questions then arising include : how does this low - energy scale evolve with increasing interaction strength , over what range of @xmath2 does it constitute the dominant low - energy physics of the problem , and when by contrast is the latter dominated by the kondo effect that one expects to prevail for sufficiently large interactions ?",
    "it is these questions we aim to address in the following sections .",
    "the impurity green function for the interacting system , @xmath48 , is related to @xmath49 by the dyson equation @xmath50^{-1}- { \\sigma_{i } } ( \\omega ) } \\;\\mbox{.}\\ ] ] this simply defines the interaction self - energy @xmath51 , considered here via perturbation theory ( pt ) in @xmath2 about the noninteracting limit .",
    "one does not doubt such an approach in principle for , although we are interested in the narrow - band regime , the impurity is coupled to a _",
    "metallic _ host and one thus anticipates ubiquitously a fermi liquid ground state that is perturbatively connected to the noninteracting limit @xcite .",
    "pt is of course limited in practice , by the order to which it is taken .",
    "the 1st order ( hartree ) contribution to @xmath52 , of @xmath53 , is cancelled precisely by the bare site - energy @xmath20 .",
    "the lowest order process is thus of 2nd order in @xmath2 , whereby a propagating @xmath54-spin electron generates a particle - hole fluctuation of opposite spin on the impurity .",
    "diagrammatically , it reads @xmath55{$ { { \\sigma_{i } } } ( \\omega ) \\ , \\sim \\,$ } }    \\put(3,0.0){\\epsfig{file = sigma2pt.eps , width=5\\units } }    \\end{picture}\\ ] ] with wavy lines representing the interaction @xmath2 and left - going ( right - going ) solid lines representing a free particle ( hole ) propagator @xmath56 .",

    "it describes particle - hole excitations obtained by transferring an electron from an occupied state below the fermi level ( @xmath64 ) to an unoccupied state above it ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "the narrow - band model is dominated by particle - hole excitations between the bonding and the anti - bonding orbital , involving an energy cost of @xmath66 , which in @xmath67 translates to pole of weight @xmath68 at @xmath69 .",
    "in addition , @xmath61 contains two continua , associated with particle - hole excitations to / from the single - particle band and therefore of small spectral weight .",

    "the self - energy in 2nd order perturbation theory ( 2pt ) is given by ( [ fig : sigma2pt ] ) , which translates to : @xmath75 in analogy to the above calculation for the polarisation propagator , we use the hilbert transforms for @xmath76 and @xmath77 to obtain : @xmath78 again , due to particle - hole symmetry , we may restrict the following discussion to positive frequencies ; and @xmath79 follows from @xmath80 by hilbert transformation .    in the narrow - band limit , the 2pt self - energy is dominated by the following process : an extra @xmath54-electron is placed in the empty anti - bonding orbital ( energy cost @xmath46 ) and excites an electron of opposite spin from the bonding to the anti - bonding orbital ( energy cost @xmath66 ) . in @xmath80 ,",
    "this generates a pole of weight @xmath81 at @xmath82 , that gives by far the dominant contribution .",
    "much weaker contributions to @xmath80 arise in addition from the extra electron being placed in the single - particle band instead of the orbital , or involve one of the particle - hole continua discussed above .",

    "it leads to @xmath89 close to the fermi level @xmath62 , corresponding to conventional fermi liquid behaviour @xcite .",
    "numerical results for the impurity spectrum @xmath90 within 2pt will be given in the following section .",
    "here we develop an approximate , but rather accurate analysis that shows in simple physical terms how the spectrum evolves with interaction strength , particularly on the low - energy scales of primary interest .    as discussed above the self - energy",
    "is dominated by poles at @xmath91 , its continua being negligibly small in the narrow - band regime and vanishing as @xmath92 .",
    "we thus retain solely the pole contributions , _",

    "the resultant spectrum then consists of a continuum for @xmath100 , and two sets of poles at @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( `` set '' meaning a pole at positive frequency and its counterpart occurring symmetrically below the fermi level @xmath62 ) .",
    "the latter follow from the single - particle pole equation @xmath103 ; insertion of ( [ resigmapt2 ] ) into which , together with the expansion @xmath104  which is valid for @xmath105  yields a biquadratic with solutions @xmath106 \\ ; \\mbox{.}\\ ] ] the set of low - frequency poles at @xmath107 , with pole weights @xmath108 , have their origin in the molecular orbitals of the non - interacting problem , to which they reduce for @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",

    "by contrast the low - energy continuum @xmath220 is non - zero only on the band scale @xmath45 , is pinned at the fermi level where @xmath221 ubiquitously , and contains a well developed kondo resonance on the scale @xmath222 . from eq .",
    "( [ regihilbert ] ) it follows that @xmath223 , given asymptotically by    [ regiasym ] @xmath224    where @xmath225 is the integrated weight of the low - energy continuum . from eq .",
    "( [ regiasym ] ) the zeros of @xmath211 , and hence the poles of @xmath6 , thus occur at @xmath226 given by @xmath227 ( which is self - consistent provided @xmath228 as indeed found , see below ) ; the corresponding pole - weight in @xmath6 , given from eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) by @xmath229 , is    [ polesipole ] @xmath230 since @xmath168 is normalized to unity however , the integrated low - energy spectral weight @xmath231 . in strong coupling",
    "moreover , where @xmath232 ( @xmath216 ) , the leading asymptotic behaviour of the high - energy spectral pole - weight @xmath233 is in turn readily deduced by taking the limit of constant @xmath234 and @xmath92 , _ i.e. _ by considering fixed @xmath11 and @xmath92 , which is just the two - site limit for which @xcite @xmath235 ( amounting in effect to perturbation theory in @xmath236 ) .",
    "hence @xmath237 , and from eq .  ( [ omegasipole1 ] ) , @xmath238    eq .",
    "( [ omegasipole ] ) ( with @xmath239 from ( [ weightsipole ] ) ) is the result in strong coupling @xmath14 for the poles in @xmath6 .",
    "the arguments for it do not depend upon perturbation theory in @xmath2 about the non - interacting limit , but the result itself is precisely that arising from simple 2pt , eq .",
    "( [ resigmapt2 ] ) .",
    "this is salutory , for although 2pt extrapolated to strong coupling produces an inadequate caricature of the kondo resonance on scales @xmath240 ( see e.g.   [ sec : spectra ] ) , the above arguments suggest that on scales of order @xmath11 it becomes asymptotically exact in strong coupling . in addition , noting that @xmath46 is @xmath2-independent and that eq .",
    "( [ omegasipole ] ) holds both perturbatively for @xmath241 and in strong coupling @xmath14 , it is clear that any dependence of the poles in @xmath6 upon @xmath2 is at best weak across the entire range of interaction strengths .",
    "there is a second feature of the above analysis to which we would draw attention , namely that the poles in @xmath6 connect continuously to that characteristic of the atomic limit , @xmath242 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath243 ) . as @xmath244 the two poles in @xmath6 ,",
    "each of weight @xmath245 and occurring at @xmath91 with @xmath11 , coalesce to a single pole at @xmath62 with weight @xmath246 , thus producing @xmath247 this result , which corresponds to 2pt , is of course well known @xcite to be exact in the atomic limit for all @xmath112 , a feature that is particular to the particle - hole symmetric case considered .",
    "hofstetter and kehrein @xcite have considered the behaviour of @xmath6 for the narrow - band aim from the perspective of the skeleton expansion , where the _ exact _ propagator @xmath48 is inserted into every skeleton diagram contributing to @xmath6 . they point out that the pinning of the single - particle spectrum at the fermi level ( for all @xmath248 and any @xmath249 ) attests to the convergence of the skeleton expansion on the lowest energy scales characteristic of the fermi liquid continuum .",
    "conversely , following kehrein @xcite , they show that the @xmath250 poles in @xmath6 can not be explained in any order of the skeleton expansion , which fails to converge for such frequencies .",
    "given the above connection between the poles in @xmath6 and that endemic to the atomic limit , the latter behaviour is entirely natural , since it is known that the skeleton expansion fails to converge for the atomic limit ( and more generally , but in essence equivalently , for an insulator @xcite ) .",
    "in view of the above it may be instructive to consider the failure of the skeleton expansion , taking the atomic limit as a paradigm .",
    "the essence of the skeleton expansion to any finite order is that it involves a _ partial _ infinite - order summation of diagrams obtained from pt in @xmath2 ( and themselves expressed in terms of the non - interacting propagator @xmath49 ) . as such however",
    ", it may fail to include higher - order diagrams that act in large part to cancel those that are included , and this is where the dangers arise .",
    "consider for example the following diagram , which is 4th order in pt but is included in the class of 2nd order skeletons : @xmath251 it represents a process creating two particle - hole excitations of spin @xmath57 on the impurity site .",
    "if the first such pair has not hopped off the impurity when the second pair is created  as is inexorable in the atomic limit  then such processes are formally forbidden by the pauli principle .",
    "they are nonetheless properly cancelled by exchange diagrams arising from the same order in pt , for example : @xmath252 however the exchange diagram ( [ fig : sigmaskel2x ] ) , while arising to the same order in pt as ( [ fig : sigmaskel2 ] ) , belongs to the class of 4th order skeletons . in this sense it is of higher order , and",
    "would not therefore be included if the skeleton expansion was truncated at 2nd order .",
    "generalizing this reasoning illustrates that the skeleton expansion , if truncated after a certain class , will include specific series of diagrams without necessarily accounting for the corresponding exchange terms , since the latter belong in general to a higher skeleton class .",
    "hence , even for systems where pt in @xmath2 is known to converge order - by - order , the order - by - order convergence in _ skeletons _ may not be taken for granted .    the atomic limit ,",
    "whose relevance to the narrow - band aim has been pointed out above , provides a direct example of the latter point . here",
    "@xmath6 is given exactly by 2pt ( eq .  ( [ sigmaatomic ] ) ) , _ i.e. _ by @xmath253 ( where , trivially , the unperturbed @xmath254 .",
    "the problem is convergent order - by - order in straight pt , all diagrams contributing to @xmath6 in any given order @xmath255 of pt summing precisely to zero .",
    "consider by contrast the second - order skeleton expansion , denoted @xmath256 and obtained from eq .",
    "( [ fig : sigma2pt ] ) by replacing @xmath56 with the exact @xmath257 , to give @xcite @xmath258 \\stackrel{\\omega\\to 0}{\\sim } -\\omega/9 $ ] .",
    "this fails entirely to capture the @xmath259 behaviour of the exact @xmath6 @xcite ( save trivially for @xmath260 ) , and that it does so for the essential reasons outlined above is directly evident by recasting @xmath261 as a functional of @xmath56 , viz : @xmath262^{2}}\\ ] ]    finally , we note that the behaviour described in this section is not specific to the narrow - band aim , but arises also in the infinite - dimensional hubbard model at half filling ( in which context study of the narrow - band aim was first motivated @xcite ) . within ipt @xcite ,",
    "as @xmath2 approaches the critical @xmath263 for the mott transition from the metallic phase @xmath264 , the self - energy acquires poles ( or strictly , sharp resonances ) at finite @xmath207 in a preformed gap ; and as @xmath265 the pole positions approach the fermi level @xmath62 ( less rapidly than the central fermi liquid continuum vanishes ) , and with weights that remain finite .",
    "hence as @xmath266 the low - frequency behaviour characteristic of an insulator  @xmath267 which amounts in essence to that for the atomic limit  is smoothly recovered via ipt .",
    "the poles in @xmath6 are thus an integral facet of the mott transition and , from the discussion above , we believe the success of ipt in capturing it is intimately connected to its ability @xcite to recover correctly the atomic limit . by contrast , since the poles in @xmath6 can not be captured via the skeleton expansion @xcite , approaches based at heart upon the latter  such as self - consistent perturbation theory @xcite  simply fail to uncover the transition @xcite .",
    "we have studied in this article the symmetric aim with a narrow host band , @xmath38 .",
    "simple though it is , second order perturbation theory in @xmath2 is found to give a rich and relatively complete account of the underlying single - particle dynamics . in particular , and in agreement with recent lanczos calculations @xcite",
    ", it leads naturally to two distinct regimes of spectral behaviour according to whether @xmath135 or @xmath4 , and whose essential characteristics we have argued to be largely independent of the details of 2pt itself .",
    "we have also shown that 2pt is remarkably robust on energy scales of order @xmath268 , that reflect the underlying molecular orbitals characteristic of the non - interacting limit .",
    "here we have argued that the 2pt result for the self - energy is correct both perturbatively in weak coupling ( by construction ) , _ and _ in the strong coupling limit @xmath14 .",
    "such poles in @xmath6  which can not be captured to any order in a skeleton expansion @xcite  thus appear to be an essentially @xmath2-independent characteristic of the narrow - band aim , and that they are captured by 2pt is in turn closely related to its ability to recover correctly the atomic limit of the model .",
    "the latter comments also illustrate the difficulties that confront any theory which seeks to describe single - particle dynamics of the narrow - band aim in strong coupling , and on all energy scales . at low energies @xmath269 characteristic of the kondo resonance ,",
    "low - order pt in @xmath2 will naturally not suffice and an intrinsically non - perturbative approach will be needed . and",
    "yet for energy scales on the order of @xmath270 the essential result of 2pt must be recovered  which as we have discussed is a delicate matter , since obvious approaches based on partial infinite - order summation of pt in @xmath2 are liable to qualitative failure here . while accessible to numerical techniques such as the numerical renormalization group @xcite , we do not know of any conventional theoretical approach that can encompass these twin dictates . in a subsequent paper",
    "we will however show that a recently developed local moment approach @xcite can handle the problem .",
