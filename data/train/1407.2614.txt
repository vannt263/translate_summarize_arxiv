    "the ucr volume has been matched to contain the same amount of matter as in the cr . for each galaxy , we construct its baryonic mass accretion history ( mah ) , until its progenitor ( parent galaxy ) can not be further identified .",

    "our results are not sensitive to the size of the kernel as long as it is larger than the average galaxy inter - separation within the volume .",
    "our goal is to compare the galaxy growth in various environments and estimate contributions from mergers and smooth accretion .",
    "figure  [ fig : mahs ] shows the median of the mah distributions for the cr and uc simulations , averaged over periods of 50myr .",
    "we choose the median over the mean because the distributions are not gaussian but substantially skewed , and the mean is particularly sensitive to the influence of outliers .",
    "the first and second columns show the distributions for the underdense , average and overdense regions ( density - binned case ) .",
    "the third and last columns represent the mass - binned distributions .",
    "the cr and ucr distributions differ substantially .",
    "the density - binned distributions show a rather flat behavior due to the mixing of various masses within a given region , with a slightly decreasing trend for the gaseous component and increasing one for the stars in cr .",
    "the ucr is even flatter and has a lower median mass by a factor of @xmath56 .",
    "as dicussed below , the most massive galaxies are virtually absent from the low density regions .",
    "on the other hand , the mass - binned case shows a clear growth trend among the various mass bins , especially for higher masses .",
    "two are the main differences that strive between the cr and ucr simulations due to the effect of the imposed constraint ( section[sec : ics ] ) .",
    "first , the cr galaxies with @xmath57 form earlier than in the ucr case , which can also be seen for the density - binned curves .",
    "although different resolutions could play a role , mostly in triggering the onset of sf , this does not affect the general results  the least massive objects , those with @xmath58 , exhibit the same distribution and the time appearance in cr and ucr runs .",
    "secondly and most importantly , massive galaxies with @xmath59 in the ucr simulation are completely absent , since no halos with masses above @xmath60 form before @xmath2 . at large , the growth trends for both gas and stars",
    "are similar in both simulations ( once the sf takes place in the ucr simulation ) , with one important difference  the mass accumulation in galaxies in the overdense regions proceeds at an accelerated rate .",
    "galaxies with @xmath61 show that the median mass increases as log@xmath62 , i.e. , @xmath48 increases exponentially ( with the exception of gas mass which saturates at @xmath63 in @xmath59 , due to the sf ) .",
    "the stellar and gaseous components in galaxies with @xmath64 grow faster than in less massive galaxies .",
    "these massive objects are mostly found in the over- and average - density regions , favorable to the mass accumulation by smooth accretion and mergers .",
    "figure  [ fig : gas ] shows the mass - binned gas accretion rates for the cr and ucr simulations . because the lower mass cutoff in minor mergers depends on the numerical resolution limit , and because their overall contribution is small , we have added them to the smooth accretion .",
    "as before , the trends provide the median of the distributions .",
    "the mass - binned distributions clearly show that the smooth accretion rate dominates over the total merger contribution at all @xmath1 , in all mass bins and for both simulations .",
    "furthermore , minor merger mass input rate appears to be insignificant when compared to the smooth accretion rate , as shown by the green - dotted lines which are almost identical to the the black lines representing smooth accretion . for the cr run ,",
    "intermediate merger rate is more than an order of magnitude below the smooth accretion , and even its peaks reach only @xmath65 .",
    "the major merger input rate is naturally more spiky , but generally falls well below that of the intermediate ones . for cr galaxies , mergers play some role only for @xmath66 ( and only for @xmath67 bin ) , and an intermittent role at lower @xmath1 .",
    "however , their spiky median distributions and shadowed regions , which could overlap with the smooth accretion trends , indicate that sometimes their contribution can be substantial .",
    "similarly for the ucr simulation  major mergers dominate among mergers at high-@xmath1 ( although lower than cr due to the delayed evolution of the normal regions with respect to the overdense ones ) , and intermediate mergers contribute more at @xmath68 .",
    "galaxies with @xmath69 exhibit a slow constant growthrate , while more massive objects show an accelerated exponential growth as discussed above .",
    "as these massive galaxies prefer an overdense environment , where the number density of potential mergers as well as of the background igm is highly elevated , we observe this growthrate bifurcation .",
    "there is an overall decline of merger gas input rate after @xmath70 for massive galaxies because their gas fraction decreases with time .",
    "overall , figure  [ fig : gas ] shows that the gas supply rate to galaxies is dominated by the smooth accretion over the mergers . among mergers ,",
    "the intermediate ones dominate the major mergers , as seen from the thick dashed lane which nearly always coincides with the solid blue lane .          the behavior of stellar accretion mirrors that of the gas in many aspects but differs because of the _ in - situ _ sf .",
    "the sf rate dominates the stellar mass growth in galaxies for all mass - bins , independently of environment ( fig .",
    "[ fig : stellar ] ) .",
    "here we show explicitly the minor merger contributions since there is no stellar counterpart of the smooth gas accretion .",
    "the sf rate successfully competes with the contributions from mergers in the cr and ucr simulations . for limited time periods of merger activity in the ucr simulation",
    ", the mergers can dominate .",
    "the sf rate exhibits similar exponential growthrate with @xmath1 for @xmath71 , and is flat for the lower masses , where major merger activity dominates .",
    "the similarity in the sf rate to that of the smooth gas accretion serves an indication that most of the accreted gas is cold and metal - rich , thus able to facilitate the sf , as elaborated elsewhere .",
    "we also note that for the cr galaxies located in overdense environment , @xmath54 , the overall merger mass input represents more than @xmath72 , mostly comprised of intermediate and minor mergers , although major mergers do contribute more to the growth of the stellar content than in the case of the gas .",
    "the fraction of the _ total _ mass accumulated by the mergers is @xmath73 ( cr ) and @xmath74 ( ucr ) for @xmath75 .",
    "the fraction of stars in galaxies contributed by mergers is @xmath3 ( cr ) and @xmath4 ( ucr ) .    by analyzing the physical properties of galaxies in our simulations ,",
    "we have determined that the tight correlations sfr@xmath76 and and metallicity @xmath77 of goods lbgs @xcite for the ucr can be extended to @xmath10 and to large overdensities ( cr ) ( figs .  [ fig : properties]a - b ) , and show excellent agreement with few known observing points ( fig .",
    "[ fig : properties]a ) .",
    "we also observe that more massive galaxies have older median stellar populations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : properties]c )  the anticipated behavior at high @xmath1 when the sf rate is still rising .",
    "the ucr simulations can be directly compared to @xcite , which are of lower resolution in mass and spatially .",
    "we find that indeed the merger mass input rate drops towards @xmath2 , but only for the gas .",
    "the stellar contribution from the mergers continues to compete with the _ in - situ _ sf . for the cr run ,",
    "the relative contribution of mergers to the gas and stars is lower than in the ucr .",
    "partly , this difference with @xcite can be explained by their definition of a galaxy which is based on the minimum of 10 stellar particles , compared to our 500 .",
    "we have used high - resolution zoom - in cosmological simulations to study the growth of galaxies in highly overdense and normal environments at @xmath0 .",
    "the initial conditions for the overdense field have been obtained by means of the constrained realizations ( cr ) method which allows to sample rare regions without the loss of generality , while no constraints have been applied in the normal ( ucr ) region . using the same gaussian random realization as the ucr run",
    ", the cr simulation box contains the seed of a massive dm halo of @xmath78 expected to collapse by @xmath2 .",
    "we have compared the galaxy mahs for the cr and ucr simulations and have analyzed the contributions from the smooth accretion , minor , intermediate and major mergers to the growth of the gaseous and stellar components in galaxies .",
    "galaxies have been defined in terms of their stellar mass .",
    "the minimal resolved mass is @xmath37 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for comparison ,",
    "the most massive galaxy is @xmath79 situated in the @xmath80 halo at @xmath2 .",
    "galaxies with @xmath81 can represent high-@xmath1 lbgs detected at @xmath82 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "note that the halo occupation number is larger than unity .",
    "our main result concerns the prevailing mode of galaxy growth .",
    "the overdense environment considered here is a typical one to obtain collapse of @xmath83 dm halo by @xmath2 in the top - hat model .",
    "the underlying dm structure of the region is responsible for the accelerated galaxy evolution observed in the cr .",
    "we find that the smooth accretion rate from cosmological filaments substantially dominates over that from mergers .",
    "consequently , by @xmath2 , the assembled median galaxy mass which has been contributed by mergers ( gas@xmath84stars ) falls by more than an order of magnitude below the accretion input for cr and by a factor of 5 for the ucr galaxies .",
    "second , we find that the growthrate of the stellar mass in mergers in overdense regions lies also below the _ in - situ _ sf rate .",
    "the accumulated stellar mass due to the merger contribution falls short of the locally - produced stars , only @xmath3 of the total stellar mass for the cr and @xmath4 for the ucr objects .",
    "our median sf rates for galaxies with @xmath85 agrees nicely with the current measure of @xmath6 galaxies using spitzer s surfs - up survey @xcite .",
    "finally , we find that the main difference between the normal and overdense regions lies in that galaxy evolution rate in the latter ones has been amplified and leads to the formation of more massive galaxies , which are absent in the normal regions .",
    "[ fig : mahs ] underlines this trend : in both cr and ucr runs , only galaxies @xmath86 amplify their growth rate .",
    "this leads to the median stellar mass of the cr galaxies in the highest bin to ` fatten ' by a factor of @xmath8 during @xmath0 .",
    "merger activity becomes relevant at @xmath87 , especially in the overdense regions and for the most massive galaxies .",
    "the decrease in the major merger activity in bringing in the gas indicates that the relative fraction of the gas in galaxies becomes lower with @xmath1 , which is confirmed directly .",
    "the gas accretion does depend on the type of feedback mechanisms imposed in the numerical modeling . while in principle the agn feedback ( neglected here ) could halt the smooth accretion which proceeds mainly along the filaments , this is rather inconclusive , as this feedback is known to be anisotropic .",
