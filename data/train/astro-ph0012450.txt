    "dust in protostellar envelopes and accretion disks is a major component of pre - stellar matter , strongly influencing the thermodynamical and gas dynamical behavior of these young objects as well as their observable appearance .",
    "dust provides the seeds for planetesimals , which in turn evolve into the constituents of a planetary system : comets , planets , moons , and the debris associated with asteroids and kuiper belt objects .",
    "interstellar dust evolves significantly from its initial state in recently formed molecular clouds up to the formation of planetesimals around stars and , as the gas density increases , it does so at an ever increasing rate . in molecular clouds",
    "it takes several 10@xmath4  yr to build up large fluffy grains by dust coagulation ( ossenkopf 1993 ; weidenschilling & ruzmaikina 1994 ) . in the midplane of accretion disks this time scale shrinks to about 10@xmath5  yr due to the high densities there ( mizuno , markiewicz , & vlk 1988 ; mizuno 1989 ; schmitt , henning , & mucha 1997 )",
    ".    it would be naive to imply , however , that it is only a matter of time before coagulation produces the first planetesimals of several km in size .",
    "other processes affect grain growth and evolution : orbital decay , shattering , cratering , sputtering , and compacting of amorphous grains , in addition to adsorption , outgassing , and chemical reprocessing of molecules .",
    "these processes depend critically on the physical conditions within the disk and on the grains relative velocities .",
    "large compact dust grains ( @xmath6 m ) can decouple from the gas and gain large relative velocities to each other which could prevent coagulation due to a limited sticking strength .",
    "by contrast , large fractal dust grains  such as ballistic cluster cluster agglomeration ( bcca ) particles  are always well coupled to the gas component ; large bcca particles do not achieve sufficient relative velocities to coagulate effectively ( schmitt et al .",
    "the assumption of an `` intermediate '' type of fractal grains , the so called ballistic particle cluster agglomeration ( bpca ) particles , could alleviate this problem .",
    "such coagulates possibly couple sufficiently well to the gas to prevent high relative velocities and behave in the limit of a large number of constituent grains like compact particles , so that turbulence and systematic relative velocities can drive coagulation ( ossenkopf 1993 ) .",
    "a high sticking strength is a necessary prerequisite for effective coagulation up to planetesimal sizes , since turbulent relative velocities can prevent the coagulation of pre - planetesimal dust grains ( weidenschilling & cuzzi 1993 ) .",
    "this could be achieved with ice or frost layers on the colliding particles surfaces ( bridges et al .",
    "1996 ; supulver et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "dust coagulation leads to important modifications of the protostellar matter .",
    "turbulence in accretion disks is strongly coupled to the opacity of the medium which in turn is dependent on the type of dust material and the dust grain size distribution .",
    "a high degree of coagulation implies significant reduction of the dust opacity ( mizuno et al .",
    "reduced opacity is necessary to damp turbulence which otherwise would be a mayor obstacle for the pre - planetesimal dust particles to settle down to the disk s equatorial plane ( weidenschilling 1984 ) . during the formation of an accretion disk , however , virtually unprocessed dust material is continuously being supplied by the parent molecular cloud core .",
    "`` second generation '' coagulation occurs ( mizuno 1989 ) which also influences opacity and the dynamics of the disk .    for this study we calculated the dust evolution during the formation of a protostellar accretion disk using a multi - component radiation hydrodynamics code , an improved version of a rhd - code designed for one component ( yorke , bodenheimer , & laughlin 1995 ; yorke & bodenheimer 1999 ) .",
    "different dust models are applied and the influence of the dust  dust sticking strength is investigated .",
    "brownian motion , turbulence , differential radiative acceleration and gravitative sedimentation with size dependent relaxation time scales are considered as sources of relative velocities between the dust grains .",
    "mean dust opacities are calculated directly from the actual dust size distribution and are continuously updated in the radiation transport module .",
    "finally , a diagnostic frequency and angle dependent radiation transport code is used to produce synthetic dust continuum emission maps and spectra which give information on observational consequences .    in section 2",
    "we describe our models for the dust and in section 3 we sketch our numerical approach to the problem .",
    "the initial conditions for the particular cases considered are introduced in section 4 and the numerical results of the simulations are presented in section 5 . in the final section 6",
    "these results are discussed in light of observable consequences and conclusions are drawn .",
    "according to our present picture of the interstellar medium , dust grains more or less uniformly permeate gas clouds , contributing about one percent of their total mass .",
    "the grain size distribution follows a power law with an exponent of about @xmath7 ( mathis , rumpl , & nordsieck 1977 ; hereafter mrn ) .",
    "mrn estimated maximum and minimum grain sizes at several nm and several @xmath1 m , respectively .",
    "the constituent dust grains were assumed to be mainly `` astrophysical '' silicates with some contribution by `` graphites '' . with this dust model",
    "they could fit the overall extinction curve of the diffuse interstellar medium quite well .",
    "however , observations of dense molecular cloud cores show that the upper limiting grain size is shifted to larger radii ( polarization measurements of vrba , coyne , & tapia 1993 ; theoretical predictions by fischer , henning , & yorke 1994 ) .",
    "coagulation is assumed to grow large grains in this environment .",
    "three different dust models are considered .",
    "first , we treat the dust as compact spherical particles . for this model",
    "there are a several theoretical studies which deal with dust opacities ( yorke 1988 ) , sticking strengths ( chokshi , tielens , & hollenbach 1993 ) , the physics of dust shattering ( jones , tielens , & hollenbach 1996 ) , and gas  dust coupling strengths ( yorke 1979 ) .",
    "thus , the basic physical properties are reasonably well defined , although more recent experimental work indicates that the critical sticking velocities tend to be higher than theoretical estimates by about a factor of 10 ( poppe & blum 1997 ) .",
    "we next consider fractal bpca grains and bcca grains .",
    "ossenkopf ( 1993 ) developed a theoretical dust model for these fluffy particles and provided analytical expressions for the gas  dust and the dust ",
    "dust interaction cross sections as a function of the compact volume of the grains .",
    "henning & stognienko ( 1996 ) have calculated opacities for these fractal dust particles and wurm ( 1997 ) generalized the sticking strength of chokshi et al .",
    "( 1993 ) to fractal coagulates .",
    "again , recent experimental studies indicate critical sticking velocities to be about an order of magnitude larger than the theoretical values ( poppe & blum 1997 ) .",
    "m ( _ dotted line _ ) , 5@xmath1 m ( _ dashed line _ ) and 0.2 mm ( _ dot - dashed line_).,width=294 ]    because dust is the predominant source of extinction in the temperature , density , and wavelength regimes considered ( e.g. yorke & henning 1994 ) , we have included only the dust s contribution to opacity and radiative acceleration .",
    "the specific extinction @xmath8 of the component @xmath9 at wavelength @xmath10 is proportional to the specific cross section of the spherical grains : @xmath11 the extinction gain factor @xmath12 , the albedo @xmath13 , and the asymmetry parameter @xmath14 are calculated from mie - theory using the dielectric constants for `` astronomical '' silicates given by draine & lee ( 1984 ) .",
    "the net specific extinction of the dust grains @xmath15 is the weighted sum over the different constituent grain sizes ( fig .",
    "[ piopac1 ] ) . here , @xmath16 is the specific radiation pressure opacity needed to determine the interaction of the dust particles with the stellar radiation flux @xmath17 .",
    "the radiative acceleration of the dust particles is given by : @xmath18      sticking of the spherical dust grains can be described by application of the theory of elasticity ( chokshi et al .",
    "one determines the binding energy of two spheres brought together under consideration of elastic wave dissipation in the two bodies .",
    "the resultant binding energy is set equal to the relative kinetic energy of the two colliding particles .",
    "this gives a critical sticking velocity , above which coagulation ceases and the particles bounce .",
    "thus , @xmath19 is given by : @xmath20    the constants @xmath21 and e denote the surface energy per unit area and young s modulus of the dust material , respectively .",
    "@xmath22 is the reduced radius of the contact surfaces and @xmath23 is the reduced mass of the two colliding dust particles .",
    "this expression differs by a numerical factor of about 3 from the original formula by chokshi et al .",
    "( 1993 ) when applied to spheres , because a correction of dominik & tielens ( 1997 ) has been applied ( see discussion by wurm 1997 ) .",
    "note that beckwith , henning , and nakagawa ( 2000 ) give a slightly different formula for @xmath19 ( quoting the same authors as above ) : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the specific mass of the grain material .",
    "the formulae [ eq - sticke]/[eq - stickv ] and eq .",
    "[ eq - stick3 ] are identical when @xmath26 and @xmath27 but differ by 18% ( 50% ) when the mass ratio of the colliding particles is 10 ( 100 ) and by a factor of almost two for extreme dust mass ratios .",
    "an ice layer on the grains surfaces enhances the critical sticking velocity by more than an order of magnitude compared to a pure silicate surface .",
    "the ice surfaces are destroyed at dust temperatures of about 125k .",
    "thus , pure silicate grains are assumed where the dust temperature exceeds the ice melting limit . according to the experiments of poppe & blum ( 1997 ) the critical sticking velocities",
    "are increased by a factor of 10 for the simulations .",
    "when the relative velocity rises above a critical velocity @xmath28 , the dust particles are shattered .",
    "this is a gradual process , starting with crater formation on the grains surfaces and ending with total disruption of projectile and target .",
    "we assume a critical shattering velocity @xmath28 for silicates ( see jones et al .",
    "1996 ) : @xmath29    jones et al .",
    "( 1996 ) also give analytic expressions for the ejected mass during a shattering encounter .",
    "when half of the mass of the target particle ( the larger of two colliding dust grains ) is shocked , they assume total disruption ; the debris particles are assumed to follow a power law size distribution with an exponent of @xmath30 to @xmath7 . in our simulations",
    "we choose an exponent @xmath7 .",
    "the upper size limit of the fragments first grows with increasing collision velocity ( i.e. increasing crater volume ) and starts to decrease inversely proportional to the relative velocity when disruption starts ( see appendix ) .",
    "the dust grains are coupled to the gas by dynamical friction . according to the gas densities in star forming regions the epstein coupling law ( epstein 1923 ; weidenschilling 1977 ) is valid",
    "because the mean free path @xmath31 of the gas molecules is large compared to the radii of the dust particles : @xmath32^{-1}\\gg a_i\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , we use an extension of the epstein law for superthermal relative velocities ( yorke 1979 ) , which often occur in later stages of the protostellar collapse : @xmath33 the interaction term @xmath34 describes the coupling of dust particles with cross section @xmath35 and mass @xmath36 with gas of density @xmath37 and isothermal sound speed @xmath38 .",
    "there is no simple relation between mass and radius for fractal grains as there is for compact spherical dust particles . here ,",
    "a grain model which describes the transition from the compact constituent grains ( at the lower radius limit of the size distribution ) to the fractals ( at the higher end ) must be applied . for",

    "in contrast to compact spherical grains the fractal coagulates stick at their limb structures which are built by the small constituent grains . the reduced radius ` r ' in eq .",

    "the formula for the sticking velocity by chokshi et al .",
    "( 1993 ) can be generalized to fractal particles ( see section [ sespstick ] ) .",
    "two approaches were followed .",
    "first , grain shattering is treated the same way as for the compact spherical grains .",
    "the analysis depends only on material parameters , the relative velocity , and the masses of the colliding particles .",
    "although this assumption may seem inadequate , it poses an upper limit to the grains resistance against shattering .",
    "fractals seem to be rather fragile constructs with low binding energy when only van der waals adhesion is considered .",
    "however , experimental studies show that fractal particles are always more resistant against destruction than the predictions of theoretical models ( poppe & blum 1997 ; wurm 1997 ) .",
    "fractals possess a multitude of vibrational excitation modes which provide a wide channel to dissipate the kinetic energy of the impacting grain .    as a second approach",
    "we adapt the shattering model of dominik & tielens ( 1997 ) : the critical shattering velocity @xmath28 is proportional to the sticking velocity @xmath19 and the number of contact points between the two colliding grains .",
    "the values thus obtained are rather low compared to the model of jones et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "the gas  dust interaction also has to be modified due to the fractal structure of bpca grains . in order to find an analytic expression for the effective cross section , ossenkopf ( 1993 ) fitted numerical calculations of the cross section @xmath45 of coagulates in dependence of their compact volume @xmath46 : @xmath47    for bcca particles",
    "the following expression has been derived : @xmath48 here , the normalization factors @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the cross section and the volume of the ( compact ) constituent grains @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the compact volume can be calculated using the filling factor of section [ sefracrad ] .",
    "thus , a relation between @xmath53 and the cross section @xmath45 of the grains can be established and used in the interaction term of section [ segasdusti ] .      for the dust ",

    "the toothing radius @xmath54 is defined as half the average distance of the center of mass of two sticking grains .",
    "it measures the penetration of two fractal grains and has been determined by ossenkopf ( 1993 ) by fits to numerical calculations which simulated the scan of the `` coastline '' of the larger dust particle by the smaller one .",

    ", it becomes obvious that the dust particles will gain relative velocities to each other .",
    "the absolute values of these velocities depend on the dust absorption and scattering cross sections , the radiative flux , the gas density and the specific cross section of the grains : @xmath60 in addition to these systematic relative velocities a random contribution is caused by brownian motion and turbulence . because our hydrodynamical grid is too coarse to resolve typical turbulent length scales , and because turbulence needs a three dimensional treatment , we apply a turbulence model developed by vlk et al .",

    "the corresponding scales of the smallest eddies are defined where the turbulent reynolds number @xmath66 of the gas with viscosity @xmath67 equals one ( i.e. the flow becomes laminar , lang 1974 ) : @xmath68 with : @xmath69 the back reaction of the gas turbulence on the dust particles depends on the coupling strength between grains and gas .",

    "the contribution of brownian motion to the random part of the relative velocities between dust grains is only important for small ( @xmath76 m ) grains : @xmath77    thus , the dust particles achieve a total relative velocity @xmath78 , where @xmath79 denotes the systematic relative velocities .",
    "these relative velocities are then evaluated according to the considerations of section [ secompact ] or [ sefrac ] .",
    "if the velocities are sufficiently low , the particles can coagulate .",
    "this is mathematically described by the coagulation equation : @xmath80 with : @xmath81 the variables @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the number density , the relative interaction cross section , and the relative velocity of grains with masses @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively . the sticking probability @xmath88 controls the onset of bouncing when the relative velocities become too high ( @xmath88 @xmath89 0 ) .",

    "larger than about 200 au the effect of coagulation becomes less important .",
    "only the small grains are removed from the size spectrum by coagulation . however , in the accretion shock just above the disk ( fig .",
    "[ piseldist ] , left panel ) the large grains are depleted relative to the low mass dust particles .",
    "the velocities of selected dust grains through the accretion shock at @xmath180au ( fig .",
    "[ pivshock ] , left panel ) show that dust grains of radii @xmath181 m and above are coupled only loosely to the gas so that significant relative velocities of several kms@xmath157 between these grains and the smaller ones are achieved .",
    "this implies that coagulation is inhibited and shattering might occur ( the threshold velocity is 2.7kms@xmath157 ) .",
    "the densities are so low , however , that the shattering time scale is @xmath0  yr .",
    "thus , the depletion of the large grains must be attributed to the fact that they pass quickly through this zone , whereas the smaller grains slow down significantly .",
    "this size dependent gas ",
    "grain drift lowers the dust to gas mass ratio by more than a factor of 2 between the two accretion shocks ( shown for the bpca fractals , see fig .",
    "[ pipcafractals ] , right panel ) .",
    "note the differing velocities above the outer accretion shock ( @xmath182au ) , caused by the size dependence of the grain opacity and thus by differential radiative acceleration . without radiative acceleration",
    "the grains should fall towards the equatorial plane faster than the gas , because they are not pressure supported . outside the outer accretion shock",
    "the grains mass distribution is still well approximated by the initial mrn mass distribution ( fig .",
    "[ piseldist ] , left panel ) . in outer regions of the cloud at the equatorial plane",
    "the infalling material is shielded from the central star by the disk .",
    "hence , the grains do indeed accrete with higher velocities than the gas component ( fig .",

    "whereas the depletion of the large grains behind the accretion shock does introduce minor modifications to the extinction coefficient , coagulation at the disk s midplane causes an opacity reduction of more than an order of magnitude for the near infrared to uv extinction . from @xmath183 cm to 0.1 mm the extinction coefficient is increased by approximately the same amount .",
    "this behaviour is indicative of the migration of the peak of the grain mass distribution to higher masses due to coagulation .",
    "to drive the coagulation beyond the initial upper grain size limit of @xmath184 m , systematic relative velocities are needed , such as those which result from differential radiative acceleration , relaxation behind the accretion shock and gravitative sedimentation .",
    "figure [ pievext ] ( right panel ) displays the resulting dust mass distribution , when these contributions to the relative motions are neglected .",
    "obviously , turbulence and brownian motion are sufficient to remove the small grains , but they are not able to build up @xmath1m - sized particles quickly . whereas for cloud clump masses of 1m@xmath123 the differential radiative acceleration of grains is negligible , it eventually becomes the most important mechanism for creating velocity differences between grains outside the accretion shock fronts when larger clump masses are considered .    to    to    to    to    to    to      how is coagulation affected by the sticking strength of the dust particles ? as pointed out in the introduction , this material property is not yet well understood .",
    "reports on experimental studies indicate larger values for the critical sticking velocity than theoretical models predict ( poppe & blum 1997 ) . ices on the grain surfaces play an important role ( supulver et al .",
    "1997 ) . to investigate this effect we conducted comparison simulations with different sticking strengths .",
    "first , the critical sticking velocities were reduced to the conservative theoretical values ( without the factor 10 correction for the experimental results , see section [ sespstick ] ) .",
    "figure [ pimiestick ] ( left panel ) displays the total mass distribution .",
    "obviously , grain growth is reduced ; the maximum grain mass is smaller by a factor of about 10 .",
    "when the critical sticking velocity is set to infinity , i.e. the grains stick at every encounter , grains up to the actual bin limit with radii of about 0.2 mm are grown .",
    "this demonstrates that the material parameters play an extremely important role in defining the upper mass limit up to which the dust grains are able to grow during the formation of an accretion disk .",
    "our next approximation treats the dust grains as fractal coagulated particles ( bpca particles ) . the same initial and boundary conditions as in the previous calculation are used . at the end of the simulation",
    "the mass of the central object is 2.3m@xmath123 with a luminosity of 59l@xmath123 .",
    "the overall evolution is qualitatively similar to the calculation with compact dust grains ( fig .",

    "again , an accretion shock has developed . in this accretion",
    "shock the dust to gas mass ratio is reduced by a factor of about 3 compared to the initial value due to size dependent advection .",
    "the specific cross section of large bpca coagulates is about a factor of 5 larger than for compact spheres of the same mass ( section [ sefrac ] ) . only particles with radii of about 10@xmath1 m and larger decouple from the motion of the gas flow in the accretion shock ( fig .",

    "coagulation in the equatorial plane proceeds at a rate similar to the simple compact spherical dust model ( fig .",
    "[ pipcavel ] , right panel ) . as in the case of spherical grains no dust particles larger than several",
    "10@xmath1 m are grown by coagulation .",
    "this can be attributed again to a finite critical sticking velocity ( see section [ seinflstick ] ) .",
    "finally , bcca grains are the most fluffy particles dealt with in these simulations .",
    "figure [ piccafractals ] ( left panel ) shows the density and the velocity of the gas component in model 3ms_cca .",
    "the overall distribution is similar to the previously discussed models ( 3ms and 3ms_pca ) .",
    "however , grain coagulation is enormously strong .",
    "grains as large as 0.2 mm ( at the limiting end of the binning ) are grown ( fig . [ piccafractals ] , right panel ) .",
    "almost all the grain mass resides in the most massive bin . because of the fluffy structure of the bcca grains the dust remains well coupled to the gas , even in the accretion shock ( fig .",
    "[ piccavel ] , left panel ) .",
    "thus , relative velocities between the dust particles remain very low .",
    "the optical properties of the gas  dust mixture at several locations in the accretion disk are plotted in figure [ piccavel ] ( right panel ) . in the equatorial plane",
    "the net specific extinction coefficient @xmath15 is lowered by more than an order of magnitude from the near infrared to uv wavelengths . from 1 mm to 100@xmath1 m the extinction is enhanced . in the accretion shock only minor modifications can be ascertained .",
    "a theoretical shattering model differing somewhat from the one discussed above has been developed by dominik & tielens ( 1997 ) . in order to test its effect on our simulations we used this model to compute the evolution of bcca grains . according to dominik & tielens ( 1997 )",
    "the shattering velocity is proportional to the critical sticking velocity .",
    "it also depends on the number of contact points between the two colliding dust grains . in our ignorance of this quantity",
    "we assume that two dust grains always have 10 contact points .",
    "figure [ piccastick ] ( left panel ) displays the density and velocity of dust grains with reduced radii @xmath185 m . in the accretion shock near to the axis of rotation these dust particles are destroyed by shattering encounters . as can be seen in the total dust mass distribution ( fig .",
    "[ piccastick ] , right panel ) , the largest dust grains with radii of 0.2 mm are not formed .",
    "we attribute this to frequent shattering encounters ; the sticking properties are identical to those used in model 3ms_cca .      to    to    to    in order to compare our numerical results to observations of young protostellar accretion disks we have produced emission maps and spectra calculated with a ` numerical telescope ' , which includes the contribution of scattered light ( yorke & bodenheimer 1999 ) .",
    "figure [ piemsphere ] ( left panel ) shows the dust continuum emission at 3.6@xmath1 m at the final stage of the collapse of the `` compact sphere '' dust model ( 3ms ) . a dark bar across the midplane of the accretion disk marks a region of high extinction . above and below",
    "the disk scattered light reveals the presence of the central protostellar radiation source .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) shown in figure [ piemsphereccaspec ] ( left panel ) displays well known features of young dusty protostellar cores ( e.g. sonnhalter , preibisch & yorke 1995 ) : no direct radiation from the protostar ( at an angle of 85@xmath186 ) , a silicate absorption feature at @xmath187 m , and a dust emission temperature of about 100k . for comparison ,",
    "the corresponding sed was recalculated for dust with an mrn mass distribution using the same density distribution .",
    "no obvious differences to the results using the more detailed coagulated dust model are detectable .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that the strongly coagulated dust particles are embedded deeply within the accretion disk , whereas the outer layers contain only slightly modified grains . however , when all dust grains are assumed to have a radius of @xmath188 m ( which corresponds to the maximum grain size formed in model 3ms ) , the calculated sed is markedly different from that resulting from dust with an mrn mass distribution .",
    "the silicate absorption feature is totally absent and more near infrared emission reaches the observer .    for comparison , an emission map using the unmodified mrn dust distribution has been calculated and displayed in figure [ piemsphere ] ( right panel ) .",
    "the differences are not overwhelming , but some general tendencies can be ascertained : for unmodified dust the dark absorption bar across the disk is somewhat more prominant ( especially towards the edges of the disk ) and more scattered light above and below the disk is visible . because almost no coagulation occurred in these outer disk regions over the time period investigated , these differences result primarily from the differential advection of dust grains .    a similar tendency can be seen for the fractal grains . in figure [ piemcca ] ( left panel ) the continuum emission for simulation 3ms_cca is displayed .",
    "in contrast to model 3ms the dark absorption bar across the disk is far more transparent at @xmath189 m when dust coagulation is permitted . when compared to the emission map resulting from uncoagulated dust with an mrn mass distribution ( fig .",
    "[ piemcca ] , right panel ) , it becomes apparant that the coagulation process has enabled the disk to become rather transparent .",
    "the overall disk features are in general similar to those resulting from the simple spherical grain model .",
    "the sed shown in figure [ piemsphereccaspec ] ( right panel ) is similar to the sed of model 3ms ( left panel ) .",
    "the sed generated using the coagulated dust from the 3ms_cca simulation ( _ solid line _",
    ", right panel ) displays some differences with respect to the sed using non - coagulated dust : there is a slight shift in the emission peak to shorter wavelengths , lower far infrared fluxes , enhanced mid - infrared emission , and a less prominent silicate absorption feature .",
    "we have shown that dust coagulation proceeds at an early phase during the formation of a protostellar accretion disk .",
    "small grains with @xmath190 m are removed from the mass spectrum quickly and effectively in the midplane of the accretion disk within @xmath19110@xmath192  yr . here ,",
    "large particles with sizes of several 10@xmath1 m can be produced by coagulation .",
    "the maximum grain size which can be quickly produced by coagulation during the collapse and initial accretion of material onto the disk depends crucially on the assumed sticking strength of the dust particles . in this respect",
    "the process of ice sublimation plays an important role : when the grain surface is coated with material which enhances the grain to grain adhesion , the degree of coagulation can be significantly increased .    in the accretion shock front relative velocities of several kms@xmath157",
    "are achieved due to the size dependent coupling to the gas .",
    "compact spherical grains decouple at higher gas densities ( and thus earlier during the evolution ) than fractal dust coagulates .",
    "particle shattering of compact spherical grains was not critically important during the evolution of the intermediate mass protostars considered here .",
    "we infer , however , by appropriate scaling of masses and luminosities ( see suttner et al .",
    "1999 ) , that shattering should be important for high mass protostars . for the high mass case",
    "radiative acceleration will become increasingly more effective in causing a size - dependent spread of dust drift velocities .",
    "assuming bcca grains which break apart at even relatively small collision energies ( as in the model of dominik & tielens 1997 ) , particle shattering gains some importance for the lower cloud masses considered here . within the accretion shock grains are shattered and the maximum grain size is limited to several @xmath193 m .",
    "however , the amount of very small debris particles thus produced is negligible in the total grain mass spectrum .",
    "gas  dust drift leads to depletion of dust in the immediate vicinity of the accretion disk everywhere except in the equatorial regions .",
    "in particular , the gas to dust mass ratio can be lowered by a factor of 2 to 4 within the accretion shock .",
    "whereas for a cloud clump mass of 1m@xmath123 radiative acceleration of dust grains is negligible , for clump masses @xmath194m@xmath123 radiative acceleration of dust grains becomes increasingly important .",
    "depending on how well the radiation field of the central source is shielded by the disk , the infall of dust particles can be hindered in the polar regions , whereas in the equatorial regions the dust moves radially inwards faster than the gas .",
    "the optical and physical properties of grains are strongly affected by coagulation .",
    "the specific extinction coefficient in the visual to uv can be lowered by more than an order of magnitude in the equatorial plane due to coagulation .",
    "the grain temperature in the midplane and the grains capacity for `` freezing out '' molecules is correspondingly affected . although the local variations of the optical coefficients are large , the only significant effect to observational properties is a reduction of the near infrared dust opacity in the wavelength range between 1 and 100@xmath1 m , which is most prominent for `` robust '' bcca particles .",
    "polarization of starlight should supply an additional appropriate observational tool to determine the degree of coagulation .",
    "the differences of the global characteristics of the simulations using the simple approximation of compact spherical grains , bpca dust , and bcca dust are not as dramatic as may have been naively expected .",
    "for all three cases the hydrodynamical structure ( in particular , gas density and velocity ) is strikingly similar .",
    "thus , we feel justified in using our rather crude dust models to perform hydrodynamic simulations of low and intermediate mass collapsing clouds and subsequently assume more sophisticated detailed dust models to generate emission maps , polarization maps , and seds .    finally , we note that dalessio et al .",
    "( 1999 ) find that synthetic 1@xmath1 m images of accretion disks around low mass stars appear to have too large geometrical thicknesses to be consistent with observation , under the assumption that dust is well mixed with the gas .",
    "our study shows that the issue might be resolved by taking into proper account the differential advection of dust grains .",
