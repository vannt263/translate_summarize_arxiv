    "quantum statistical physics , such as condensed matter or plasma physics , but also quantum chemistry , heavily depends on effective numerical methods for solving complex few - particle and many particle problems . implementing suitable theoretical concepts for their description on modern supercomputer architectures , nowadays computational physics constitutes , besides experiment and theory , the third pillar of contemporary physics  @xcite .",
    "numerical techniques become especially important for strongly correlated systems where analytical approaches largely fail .",
    "this is due to the absence of small ( coupling ) parameters or , more general , because the relevant energy scales are not well separated , both preventing the application of standard perturbative schemes .",
    "common to any numerical method in quantum physics is the requirement to represent the states and operators describing the physical system in the hilbert space in a form that is suited for computations .",
    "then , working with a discrete basis of the hilbert space , the computational challenge is the solution of an eigenvalue problem for huge ( sparse ) matrices . for most physical systems",
    "the dimension of the hilbert space is much too large in order to perform a full exact diagonalisation of the related hamilton matrix .",
    "fortunately some quantities of interest depend on the properties of the ground state or a few excited states only , and therefore may be studied by iterative krylov space techniques such as lanczos diagonalisation  @xcite .",
    "the quantum dynamics or long time behaviour of correlated systems , however , require , in principle , the knowledge of all eigenstates .",
    "the theoretical investigation of quantum dynamics was triggered in recent years by the vast progress of the experimental techniques .",
    "nowadays femtosecond laser spectroscopy , for instance , allows for a precise analysis of quantum dynamical processes with extreme time resolution .",
    "direct time integration of the schrdinger equation at the cost of a full diagonalisation of the system s hamiltonian ( including the coupling to external fields ) is impractical in such cases because of its computational complexity .",
    "the aim of this work is to propose a very efficient chebyshev - based algorithm that allows calculating the dynamics of a quantum system numerically exactly , also for relatively long times , and therefore overcomes the above mentioned problem at least partially . in order to demonstrate the power of our iterative chebyshev expansion approach , we compare the accuracy and computational costs of certain model calculations with those emerging by the use of the more the standard crank - nicholson , wigner - moyal and quantum tomography methods .",
    "we start by presenting the basic ideas of the iterative ( chebyshev , crank - nicholson ; sect .",
    "[ sect : directmethods ] ) and semiclassical ( wigner - moyal , tomographic ; sect .",
    "[ sect : semiclassicalmethods ] ) techniques .",
    "afterwards , in sect .",
    "[ sect : systems ] , we consider three different problems of increasing complexity : ( i ) the motion of a gaussian wave packet in a 1d geometry ( sec .",
    "[ sect : doublewells ] ) , ( ii ) the evolution of a particle in a disordered 2d graphene nanoribbon ( sec .",
    "[ sect : grapheneribbon ] ) , and ( iii ) the spatiotemporal evolution of polaron states in finite quantum systems ( sec .  [ sect : polaron ] ) .",

    "[ sect : conclusion ] .",
    "the time evolution of a quantum state @xmath0 is described by the schrdinger equation @xmath1 if the hamilton operator @xmath2 does not explicitly depend on time @xmath3 we can formally integrate this equation and express the dynamics of a given quantum state @xmath4 in terms of the time evolution operator @xmath5 as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 . exploiting that @xmath5 is diagonal in the eigenbasis of the hamiltonian , we can directly determine the dynamics of the quantum system .      for systems with moderate hilbert space dimensions , a full diagonalisation of the hamiltonian permits expression of the quantum dynamics of an initial state @xmath4 as @xmath8 here @xmath9 are the ( time independent ) eigenstates of the system and @xmath10 the corresponding eigenenergies . in this way , the decomposition of an initial state into a linear combination of eigenstates allows for an exact calculation of the quantum state at arbitrary times .",
    "as soon as the physical description of the system requires a larger hilbert space dimension , however , this direct calculation is no longer feasible and we have to resort to alternative approaches .",
    "_ crank - nicholson scheme .",
    "_ one of the standard methods to calculate the quantum time evolution iteratively is the crank - nicholson algorithm  @xcite . dividing @xmath11 $ ] into @xmath12 subintervals @xmath13 , the quantum state evolves for each iterative time step @xmath13 from @xmath14 to @xmath15 according to @xmath16 there are two limitations to this scheme .",
    "first , in addition to the matrix vector multiplication ( mvm ) on the right hand side of ( [ eq : cn ] ) , each iteration requires the solution of a linear system of equations to obtain @xmath17 . despite the availability of many powerful methods for the solution of large ( sparse ) linear equation systems ,",
    "this task remains the most time consuming part of the algorithm .",
    "using iterative methods for the solution of the linear equation system , the attainable hilbert space dimensions increase substantially as compared to direct methods .",
    "second , the crank - nicholson algorithm is accurate only to order @xmath18 , which severely restricts the maximum usable iterative time step .",
    "_ chebyshev scheme .",
    "_ both limitations can be overcome by an approach where we expand the time evolution operator @xmath19 into a finite series of first - kind chebyshev polynomials of order @xmath20 : @xmath21 .",

    "we use @xmath31 . note that the chebyshev expansion also applies to systems with unbounded spectra .",
    "in those cases we truncate the infinite hilbert space to a finite dimension by restricting the model on a discrete space grid or using an energy cutoff . in this way",
    "we ensure the finiteness of the extreme eigenvalues .    in  ( [ eq : u_1 ] ) ,",
    "the expansion coefficients @xmath32 are given by @xmath33 ( @xmath34 denotes the @xmath20-th order bessel function of the first kind ) .",
    "to calculate the evolution of a state @xmath4 from one time grid point to the adjacent one , @xmath35 , we have to accumulate the @xmath32-weighted vectors @xmath36 .",
    "since the coefficients @xmath37 depend on the time step but not on time explicitly , we need to calculate them only once .",
    "the vectors @xmath38 can be computed iteratively exploiting the recurrence relation of the chebyshev polynomials , @xmath39 with @xmath40 and @xmath41 . evolving the wave function from one time step to",
    "the next requires @xmath42 mvms of a given complex vector with the ( sparse ) hamilton matrix of dimension @xmath43 and the summation of the resulting vectors after an appropriate rescaling .",
    "the chebyshev expansion may also be applied to systems with time dependent hamiltonians , but there the time variation @xmath44 determines the maximum @xmath45 by which the system may be propagated in a single time step . for time",
    "independent @xmath2 , in principle , arbitrary large time steps are possible at the expense of increasing @xmath42 .",
    "we may choose @xmath42 such that for @xmath46 the modulus of all expansion coefficients @xmath47 is smaller than a desired accuracy cutoff .",
    "this is facilitated by the fast asymptotic decay of the bessel functions , @xmath48 thus , for large @xmath42 , the chebyshev expansion can be considered as quasi - exact , and permits a considerably larger time step than e.g. the crank - nicholson scheme . besides the high accuracy of the method , the linear scaling of computation time with both time step and hilbert space dimension are promising in view of potential applications to more complex systems . in our cases almost all computation time is spent in sparse mvms , which can be efficiently parallelised , allowing for a good speedup on parallel computers .      during the last decades , a variety of semiclassical methods",
    "have been tailored in order to incorporate certain quantum effects at least partially into classical many - particle simulations .",
    "based on the real time ( feynman- ) path integral formulation of quantum mechanics , where action integrals take the center stage , they allow propagation of the ( complex ) wave function of a quantum system in time . within the numerical evaluation of the integrals occurring by monte carlo ( mc ) techniques",
    "@xcite , the oscillatory complex valued integrand causes a dynamical sign problem which spoils the efficiency of the mc integration .",
    "_ wigner - moyal approach .",
    "_ since a quantum system can be described equivalently in terms of real valued quantum phase space distribution functions  @xcite , e.g. , the wigner function , the dynamical sign problem may be alleviated  @xcite .",
    "starting from the von neumann equation we may derive an evolution equation for the wigner function @xmath49  @xcite @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the classical force , and @xmath52 in the classical limit , the right hand side of ( [ eq : eom_wigner ] ) vanishes , leaving us with the liouville equation for the phase space density .",

    "using @xmath58 , we may rewrite ( [ eq : eom_wigner ] ) in form of an integral equation  @xcite , @xmath59 and solve it by iteration . here",
    ", we consider only the lowest order , which means that the second integral is neglected completely .",
    "that is , we propagate classical trajectories @xmath60 in time , after sampling their initial conditions @xmath61 and @xmath62 from the initial wigner function @xmath63 at time @xmath64 by a mc procedure .",
    "their superposition at the next time grid point gives @xmath49 .",
    "the importance of higher order terms in the iteration series was investigated in refs .",
    ".    _ quantum tomographic approach .",
    "_ as the dynamical sign problem is still present for the wigner function , some years ago the description of quantum states in terms of a strictly positive function , the so called quantum tomogram , has been proposed  @xcite .",

    "the quantum tomogram  @xcite , @xmath65 relates to the wigner function by a class of radon transforms  @xcite which are characterised by @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "each tomogram contains a density information , and tuning @xmath68 appropriately , we may continuously switch between coordinate and momentum representation .",
    "also for the quantum tomogram , an evolution equation can be derived from the von neumann equation @xmath69 \\tilde{w } = 0\\ , .",

    "( [ eq : eom_tom ] ) can be reformulated as a continuity equation and solved by trajectory methods . for potentials of arbitrary shape ,",
    "the complicated structure prevents a direct evaluation of ( [ eq : eom_tom ] ) in order to get @xmath70 .",
    "a possible way out is a local expansion of the potential up to second order  @xcite .",
    "the identification with the continuity equation then holds locally for each coordinate about which the potential is expanded .",
    "since the slope and local curvature of the potential enter the propagator for the trajectories , the efficiency of the tomogram - reconstruction depends crucially on the choice of the potential sampling positions .",
    "an intuitive , albeit not unique , choice for those positions are the coordinates of classically evolving particles similar to those in the wigner approach .",
    "advantageously , it is not necessary to propagate the whole set of tomograms if one is interested in the tomogram in one reference frame @xmath68 only .",
    "instead , it is sufficient to find those trajectories which end up in a given @xmath71 , or equivalently to propagate the desired @xmath72trajectories backward in time : one needs to be aware of the non - uniqueness of the propagator due to the various possible choices of the potential sampling points .",
    "we now apply the numerical techniques presented in the preceding section to selected physical systems and situations . as a first step ,",
    "we calibrate the different approaches by studying a simple double well toy model .",
    "detecting the limitations and prospects of the various methods seems to be necessary before applying them to the more complicated problems of current interest .",
    "let us point out that the considered implementations of the semiclassical approaches provide an approximate description of quantum mechanics only , i.e. they will clearly not reproduce all the quantum effects .",
    "for the finite graphene nanoribbons studied in the second example it is barely possible to determine the full quantum dynamics by means of direct diagonalisation techniques or applying the crank - nicholson scheme .",
    "this gives us the opportunity to benchmark their performance in comparison to the chebyshev expansion for a system for which the hamilton matrix is not tridiagonal .",
    "the last example has been chosen to demonstrate the applicability of the chebyshev approach to a true many - particle problem , the tunnelling of a polaron . there",
    "the hilbert space dimension is so large that neither the direct diagonalisation method nor the crank - nicholson can be applied .          as a basic test case we consider the motion of a gaussian wave packet in the 1d double well potential @xmath73 sketched in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : doublewell ] .",
    "we use @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , where @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 are the reference units for mass , time and length , respectively .",
    "the initial gaussian of width @xmath81 is centred at @xmath62 , with centre - of - mass momentum @xmath61 , @xmath82 where we choose @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : doublewell ] gives also the real and imaginary part of the wave function , where the baseline indicates the energy of the initial state in relation to @xmath86 .",
    "discretising the potential @xmath86 on an equally spaced grid of @xmath87 @xmath88points , we fully diagonalise the hamiltonian to get the exact dynamics as reference . if we choose the iterative time step accordingly , the real and imaginary part of the wave function at @xmath89 is reproduced by both iterative methods with an absolute error less than @xmath90 . for this",
    "the maximum allowable time step for the crank - nicholson scheme is @xmath91 . for the chebyshev approach ,",
    "the accuracy is even better than @xmath92 . here",
    "the required time step is related to the order of the chebyshev expansion , i.e. the number of moments @xmath42 .",
    "for @xmath93 we may propagate the wave function by @xmath94 . at the expense of calculating a larger number of moments @xmath42 , larger times steps may be chosen without loss of accuracy .",
    "this will be demonstrated in the next section .",
    "the time evolution of the modulus squared of the wave function is shown in the second panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : doublewell ] .",
    "while the major part of the wave packet stays in the left well , a sizeable fraction also penetrates the barrier .",
    "the rich structure in the density pattern reflects the ( well - known ) presence of strong interference effects .    restricting the wigner - moyal scheme to first order ,",
    "the corresponding data reproduces in essence the overall dynamics , but the fine interference patterns are not resolved within this approximation ( see third panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : doublewell ] ) .",
    "there are two major parameters which influence the computation time for this approach : ( a ) the number of propagated trajectories and ( b ) the time step necessary for their classical propagation . for the results presented",
    ", we have used @xmath95 trajectories and a propagation time step of @xmath96 .",
    "the agreement between the exact solution and the tomographic result ( see also the bottom panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : doublewell ] ) is even worse as the tunnelling to the right hand side of the barrier is missed almost completely .",
    "furthermore , the probability density for large negative values is overestimated , i.e. the effect of the steep anharmonic confinement potential is not accounted for correctly . in tab .  [",
    "tab : doublewell ] we summarise the run times @xmath97 on a single xeon 5160 processor required by the different methods in order to follow the time evolution of the system up to @xmath98 .",
    "this very basic example already shows that a straightforward use of the wigner - moyal and tomographic approaches only partially accounts for quantum effects . while , in principle , both methods are equivalent with respect to the solution of the time dependent schrdinger equation , an efficient implementation is lacking . for the wigner - moyal formalism",
    "there are two prospects .",
    "if the accuracy of the first order approximation is satisfactory , i.e. the neglect of the fine interference patterns is tolerable , this method provides an acceptable performance and might show its true virtue for many - particle systems . if one has to include higher terms of the iteration series , however , e.g. because subtle quantum effects are important , the method is not competitive anymore because ( i ) the computational requirements increase drastically and ( ii ) numerical fluctuations amplify strongly during the calculation  @xcite .",
    "the practical applicability of the tomographic approach to arbitrarily shaped potentials is also questionable , mainly because there is no simple way to construct suitable sampling functions for the coordinate sampling in the potential evaluation .",
    "extensions beyond harmonic potentials will suffer crucially from this limitation .",
    "apart from the poor accuracy of the results , also the computational requirements were significant higher than for the other methods ( although we used only @xmath99 trajectories in this calculation ) .",
    ".time evolution of a wave packet in the double well potential up to @xmath100 .",
    "data gives the run times by exact diagonalisation ( ed ) , crank - nicholson ( cn ) , chebyshev ( c ) , wigner - moyal ( wm ) and tomographic ( t ) methods .

    "this composite entity is called polaron . from the basic electron - phonon ( ep ) interaction processes ,",
    "the absorption / emission of a phonon with a simultaneous change of the electron state , it is clear that the motion of even a single electron in a deformable lattice constitutes a complex many - body problem , in that phonons are excited at various positions , with highly non - trivial dynamics  @xcite .",
    "polaron transport through finite quantum systems becomes increasingly important for nanotechnology applications .",
    "the microscopic structure of polarons is very rich .",
    "focusing on polaron formation in systems with short - range non - polar ep interaction and site - dependent potentials , we consider a generalised holstein hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath101 where @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) creates an electron ( phonon ) at site @xmath104 of a 1d lattice .",
    "parameters are the electron transfer integral @xmath105 , the ep coupling strength @xmath106^{1/2}$ ] , and the phonon frequency @xmath107 .",
    "the potentials @xmath108 can describe a tunnel barrier , disorder , or a voltage basis",
    ".    how does a bare electron time evolve to become a polaron quasiparticle ? to what extent can a polaron tunnel through a quantum barrier ? having the iterative chebyshev - based time evolution algorithm explained in sec .",
    "2.2 at hand , we can address these questions in the framework of model  ( [ eq : ghm ] ) .",
    "let us emphasise that our numerical approach , acting in the tensorial product hilbert space of electron and phonons , takes into account the full dynamics of both quantum objects . since the hilbert space associated to the phonons is infinite , we applied a controlled truncation procedure retaining only basis states with at most @xmath109 phonons  @xcite . however",
    "the truncated hilbert space dimension ( @xmath110 ) is still very large even for small lattices and the dimension of the corresponding sparse matrix problem does limit the physical parameter region attainable .",
    "thus , we use a memory saving implementation of the sparse mvm where the non - zero matrix elements are not stored but recomputed in each sparse mvm step , limiting the overall memory consumption of our implementation to five vectors of size @xmath110 . in this context we can access a massively parallel sparse mvm code which has proven to be sufficient to compute the ground state of the model  ( [ eq : ghm ] ) up to @xmath111 very efficiently on more than 5000 processor cores  @xcite . for the single polaron dynamics presented here , the matrix dimension is @xmath112 and we run the chebyshev approach on 18 processors of a sgi altix4700 compute server accessing a total of approximately 60 gbytes of main memory and consuming less than 500 cpu - hrs to compute the result presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : polarondynamics ] .     with momentum @xmath113 .",
    "moving to the right , a polaron is formed that hits the barrier located at site 12 at about @xmath114 . there",
    "complicated reflection and transmission processes of the composite quasiparticle made up of an electron and phonons take place .",
    "displayed is the time - evolution of the local particle densities @xmath115 ( solid lines , open circles ) , phonon numbers @xmath116 ( dot - dashed lines , stars ) and ep correlations @xmath117 ( dashed lines ) .",
    "open boundary conditions were used at sites 1 and 18 . in the numerics we account for all states with up to @xmath118 phonons and in the ground state",
    "the weight of all basis states containing exactly @xmath119 is less than @xmath120 . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : polarondynamics ] shows snapshots of polaron formation and polaron propagation at intermediate ep coupling @xmath121 in the non - adiabatic regime @xmath122 ( the time and all energies were measured in units of @xmath123 and @xmath105 , respectively ) . at @xmath124 a bare electron wave packet",
    "is injected at site 4 and launched to the right . shortly after , the electron is not yet dressed and moves nearly as fast as a free particle .",
    "but then the electron emits ( creates ) phonons in the vicinity of the electron s starting point , in order to reduce its energy to near the bottom of the band , and then forms a polaron ( see the panel at @xmath125 ) .",
    "one of the most important properties of the polaron is an increased inertial mass , for the reason that some phonons have to travel with the particle ( as indicated by the enhanced on - site ep correlations ) . at the same time we observe a `` backscattered '' current  @xcite , evolving to a left moving polaron . when the right - moving polaron reaches the wall at site 12 it will be partly reflected .",
    "more importantly , the additional local ep interaction @xmath126 renormalises the on - site adiabatic potential at site 12 , i.e. leads to a local polaron level shift that softens the barrier @xmath127 . as a result a vibration - mediated tunnelling of the particle takes place , whereby some phonons are stripped at the barrier and are recollected by the transferred particle afterwards ( cf",
    "the snapshots from @xmath128 to 14 ) .",
    "finally , the particle is reflected at the boundary and moves to the left passing the barrier again .",
    "note that during the whole run time uncorrelated phonon excitations remain in the system , especially near the injection point . in our opinion",
    "this example impressively demonstrates that our approach can be used to monitor the complicated multiple time - scale dynamics of quasiparticle transport in finite quantum structures .",
    "to summarise , in this work we compared various numerical approaches to the dynamics of complex quantum systems : expansion into eigenstates , iterative crank - nicholson and chebyshev schemes , as well as semiclassical wigner - moyal and quantum tomography methods .",
    "the different methods have been applied to several physical systems and problems , ranging from motion in a simple double - well toy model to questions of current interest such as electron transport in disordered graphene nanoribbons or polaron motion in a finite quantum structure .",
    "the wigner - moyal approach , evaluated in first order of the iteration series , essentially reproduces the quantum dynamics .",
    "nevertheless important quantum interference effects , appearing in the exact solution , are missed .",
    "the successful application of the quantum tomogram to the time evolution of quantum systems crucially depends on a suitable sampling algorithm for the coordinates at which the potential is evaluated .",
    "if those are sampled according to trajectories of classically propagated particles , the result for the quantum dynamics is rather poor and fails to describe tunnelling and anharmonicity effects correctly .",
    "while the moderate numerical costs of the first order wigner - moyal approach seem appealing for a possible application to more complex systems , the computational resources required by the quantum tomographic approach are high in general . on the side of the exact techniques ,",
    "the chebyshev approach largely outperforms the standard crank - nicholson scheme , both in computation speed ( usable time step ) and treatable system sizes ( only matrix - vector multiplications were required ) .",
