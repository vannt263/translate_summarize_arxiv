    "one interesting problem is to analyze the lowest value of parameter @xmath1 under which fractional order dynamical systems show chaotic or hyperchaotic behaviors .",
    "stability analysis , synchronization and control of fractional order systems by using different techniques are also widely investigated @xcite and are of great interest due to their application in control theory , signal processing , complex networks , etc @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the possibility to control unstable equilibria and unstable periodic orbits in fractional order chaotic systems by a time - delayed feedback method .",
    "pyragas introduced the time - delayed feedback control ( tdfc ) in 1992 by constructing a control force in a form of a continuous feedback proportional to the difference between the present and an earlier value of an appropriate system variable @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath3 $ ] , with @xmath4 and @xmath5 being the constant control parameters denoting the feedback gain and the time delay , respectively @xcite . to stabilize unstable periodic orbits ,",
    "the delay @xmath5 is chosen to match the period of the unstable orbit . in the case of controlling unstable equilibria , the optimal delay is related to the intrinsic characteristic time scale given by the eigenfrequencies of the uncontrolled system . in both cases ,",
    "the control force vanishes when the target state is reached , rendering the method noninvasive . in this sense ,",
    "the unstable states of the uncontrolled system are not changed , since the control force acts only if the system deviates from the state to be stabilized .",
    "the main advantage of the pyragas method over the other control methods is that it does not require the knowledge of the system s equations and the positions of the unstable states whose control is desireable .",
    "the method has been used in many concrete applications @xcite , and also rigorously investigated analytically @xcite . in recent works @xcite , it has been shown that the efficiency of the method is greatly improved by deterministic or stochastic modulation of the time delay @xmath5 .",
    "this variable delay feedback control ( vdfc ) has been shown successful in stabilization of unstable equilibria in systems described by both ordinary and delay differential equations .",

    "ii we present the time - delayed feedback controller for stabilization of unstable equilibria in fractional - order dynamical systems .",

    "it is shown , both numerically and analytically , that the unstable equilibrium point with an odd number of positive real eigenvalues can not be controlled by the time - delayed feedback method for any values of the control parameters , thus extending the validity of the odd - number limitation theorem @xcite to the case of fractional - order systems . in section iii",
    "we perform a numerical calculation of the control domain by the pyragas delayed feedback with a modulated time delay in a form of a sine - wave . in section iv we give a numerical evidence that a time - delayed feedback control can successfully stabilize unstable periodic orbits , and estimate the corresponding feedback gain intervals for which such a control is possible .",
