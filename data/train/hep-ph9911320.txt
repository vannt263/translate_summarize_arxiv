    "gell - mann and levy s [ gml ] linear sigma model is a principal example of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry in strong interactions@xcite .",
    "it is known that the linear sigma model does not always give the correct phenomenology , e.g. the value of the isoscalar pion - nucleon scattering length is too large .",
    "we shall show that in the extended linear sigma model to be presented in this paper , the phenomenology is considerably improved compared to the original gml model .",
    "another alleged drawback of the linear sigma model is that , apart from chiral symmetry , the model has not been connected directly to qcd .",
    "recently , however , it has been shown that the model can be thought of as a low - energy effective theory of coulomb gauge qcd , albeit in the unrealistic limit of maximal @xmath5 symmetry breaking@xcite .",
    "another  weakness \" of the linear sigma model is that the value of the axial coupling strength @xmath6 equals one .",
    "it is known that the one - loop `` radiative '' corrections in the linear sigma model lead to the renormalization of the nucleon part of the axial current @xcite , but it is not widely known how to incorporate that kind of correction , i.e. a value of @xmath7 , into an effective ( tree - level ) lagrangian . in some publications a proposed `` solution '' is to multiply the total axial current @xmath8 by @xmath6 where the nucleon part of the axial current is @xmath9 , and the meson part of the axial current is @xmath10 .",
    "another `` solution '' posits the same , but this time just for @xmath11 . both of these  solutions \" are inconsistent with the chiral symmetry of the model .",
    "the first one violates the chiral charge algebra by leading to @xmath12   & = &   g_a^2 { \\rm i } \\varepsilon^{abc } q^{c } \\neq { \\rm i } \\varepsilon^{abc } q^{c } ~. \\label{e : axcr } \\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second  solution \" leads to eq.([e : axcr ] ) for the nucleon part of the axial charge , and in addition to a non - conserved axial noether current even in the chiral limit since the equations of motion have _ not _ been modified .    in an earlier publication @xcite one of us",
    "re - initiated the study of a venerable , but little - known extension of the linear sigma model , see e.g. ref.@xcite .",
    "this extension allows the nucleon axial coupling constant @xmath6 to be different from unity without violating chiral symmetry .",
    "the extra term introduced in the linear sigma model is a non - renormalizable , derivative - coupling term , analogous to the pauli anomalous ( electron ) magnetic moment term that describes the finite one - loop radiative correction in qed , and that is often introduced into other effective lagrangians .",
    "this extended linear sigma model allows one to study the @xmath6 dependence of the @xmath3n scattering lengths , @xmath13 , and of the nucleon sigma term @xmath2 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath14 depends crucially on the value of @xmath6 , whereas the @xmath2 dependence on @xmath6 is unknown @xcite .",
    "we shall display this dependence and show that a large value of @xmath2 can easily be obtained without recourse to any @xmath15 component of the nucleon .",
    "we can also reproduce the new , tiny experimental value of the isoscalar @xmath3n scattering length @xmath16 .",
    "our methods and results are potentially important for studies of nuclear matter , because the quark condensate in nuclear matter is determined by the n - nucleon sigma terms @xcite , and the issue of ( p - wave ) pion condensation depends crucially on @xmath6 being different from unity @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this study is to use the extended linear sigma model to derive some of the low - energy theorems for the elastic @xmath3n scattering amplitude , to calculate the @xmath3n scattering lengths , and to discuss the nucleon sigma term @xmath2 .",
    "we believe that at least some of the generally valid predictions of chiral symmetry are most economically obtained in this model . throughout this paper",
    "we shall use the tree approximation , save for one illustrative example done at the one - loop self - consistent approximation level , shown in appendix a. in order to explore the various possibilities , and to facilitate comparison with earlier studies of the gell - mann  levy linear sigma model we introduce three different chiral symmetry breaking [ @xmath17sb ] terms , as in refs.@xcite . for two of the three @xmath17sb terms ,",
    "the effects on the pion s mass appear first at the tree level , whereas the third @xmath17sb term s effect is only visible at the one - loop level , see appendix a.    this paper falls into six sections . in section",
    "ii we define the extended linear sigma model , present the @xmath17sb terms and the canonical field variables , and show that the noether charges close the chiral algebra although @xmath7 .",
    "section  iii is devoted to a derivation of the elastic @xmath3n scattering amplitude , the adler consistency condition and the scattering lengths . in section",
    "iv we examine the nucleon sigma term @xmath2 , first from the ( formal ) operator point of view and second as extracted from the elastic @xmath3n scattering amplitude in the first born approximation to draw conclusions from the comparison of the two methods . in section  v we examine the connection with the effective pion - nucleon chiral perturbation theory , and section  vi summarizes the results .",
