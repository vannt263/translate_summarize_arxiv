    "with the advent of data from the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , phenomenological studies and interpretation of the data will require precise theoretical predictions for both signal and background processes .",
    "the calculation of higher - order terms in the qcd perturbation series thus becomes an even more important issue than at present .",
    "triple vector boson production processes are of particular interest because they are sensitive to quartic electroweak couplings and they are a standard model background for many new - physics searches , characterized by several leptons in the final state . recently",
    ", the qcd corrections for @xmath7 , , and have appeared in the literature  @xcite . with @xmath8-factors ranging from 1.5 to 2 at the lhc and a strong phase - space dependence",
    ", they show a behavior which is similar to that found in di - boson production in hadronic collisions , where qcd corrections have been known for a long time  @xcite .",
    "thus , these next - to - leading order  ( nlo ) calculations need to be taken into account for every phenomenological study involving triple vector boson production processes at the lhc .",
    "however , since vector bosons are identified via their leptonic decay products , the calculations should include the leptonic decays .",
    "furthermore , intermediate higgs contributions are not negligible since they can enhance the cross section significantly and lead to dramatic changes in the shapes of distributions for certain observables .    in this paper",
    "we compute the next - to - leading order qcd corrections to the four processes @xmath7 , , and , with subsequent decay of the vector bosons into final - state leptons .",
    "all spin correlations involved in vector boson decays , the effects due to intermediate higgs boson exchange and off - shell contributions have been correctly taken into account .",
    "two of the four processes , namely @xmath7 and @xmath9 have been computed for the first time here .",
    "the other two processes have first been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , albeit without leptonic decays and without higgs boson exchange contributions .",
    "the results of our calculations have been implemented in a fully flexible monte carlo program , producing total and differential cross sections at nlo as well as les houches event files at tree level . in this paper",
    ", we will always refer to a @xmath10 collider , having lhc in mind .",
    "however , in the program , which will be publicly available in the near future  @xcite , protons can easily be replaced by anti - protons with a simple change in an input file .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : calc ] , we discuss the organization of the calculation , the different contributions to the leading order  ( lo ) and nlo cross section and we describe the checks which we have performed . in sec .",
    "[ sec : res ] , results are presented for charged triple boson production at the lhc .",
    "we discuss the renormalization- and factorization - scale dependence and further show some sample distributions with strongly phase - space dependent @xmath8-factors . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] , we give our conclusions .",
    "the calculation for the processes presented in this paper has been performed in complete analogy to the calculation for , with leptonic decays , described in ref .  @xcite . in the following ,",
    "the different contributions to lo and nlo cross sections are discussed in detail . furthermore , the tests which we have performed to check the consistency of our results are described .",
    "we have evaluated the full set of feynman diagrams for the different final states [ eq : zzwp ] zzw^+ & & pp _ 1 ^ - _ 1^+ _ 2 ^ - _ 2^+ _ _ 3 _ 3^+ + x , + [ eq : zzwm ] zzw^- & & pp",

    "all fermion mass effects have been neglected .",
    "the indices on the lepton pairs indicate that different generations are assumed for the decay products of the three vector bosons , i.e.  interference terms due to identical leptons in the final state have been neglected . at lo , there are 209 diagrams for @xmath11 production and 85 diagrams for @xmath12 production .    the tree - level diagrams can be grouped into three distinct topologies :    1 .   the first one ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : zzwplo]a ) contains all diagrams where there is only one vector boson attached to the quark line , decaying further into 6 leptons .",
    "2 .   the second topology ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : zzwplo]b ) comprises all diagrams where exactly two vector bosons are attached to the quark line and then decay into two and four leptons , respectively .",
    "3 .   the third one ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : zzwplo]c ) consists of all diagrams where all the three vector bosons are attached to the quark line .",
    "these topologies give rise to different one - loop contributions as will be discussed later .",
    "the parts of the feynman diagrams that describe the vector bosons decaying into leptons can be seen as effective polarization vectors , computed only once and used for different quark flavor flow .",
    "for example , for @xmath13 production , the two different subprocesses @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( with an anti - quark , @xmath16 , having the same momentum as the up - quark in the first case , and identical @xmath17 and @xmath18 momenta ) share the same effective polarization vectors .",
    "these effective polarization vectors are computed numerically at the beginning of the evaluation of the full matrix elements , at a given phase space point , and reused wherever they appear .",
    "this reduces the amount of time spent in the calculation of the tree - level matrix elements significantly .    in the calculation of leptonic tensors ,",
    "special care has to be taken in the treatment of finite - width effects in massive vector boson propagators . in our code , we use the modified complex - mass scheme as implemented in madgraph , that is we globally replace @xmath19 with @xmath20 , while keeping a real value for @xmath21  @xcite .    when intermediate higgs boson exchange effects are included , particular care is needed in the generation of the phase space , since , for small higgs boson masses ( 100300  gev ) , the higgs boson width is very narrow .",
    "a breit - wigner mapping is needed for the efficient generation of this resonance . in the case of @xmath12 production",
    "there are two distinct @xmath22 pairs which can be produced from higgs boson decay while the higgs resonance appears only once in @xmath23 and @xmath11 production . for @xmath12 production",
    "we , therefore , have generated the @xmath24 boson phase space using dalitz plot variables which allow for simultaneous breit - wigner mappings of two different invariant di - boson masses and thus the two different higgs resonances .",
    "this procedure is very important for good monte carlo statistics since the higgs boson contributions can enhance the lo production cross section by up to a factor of 5 and the nlo production cross section by almost a factor of 4 as shown in table  [ tab : hmass ] .    .",

    "our nlo results agree at the 1% level , which is satisfactory , given the same level of agreement for the lo cross sections and the size of the monte carlo errors .",
    "the calculations described in the previous section have been implemented in a fully flexible parton - level monte carlo program , , which originally was developed for the prediction of nlo qcd corrections to vector boson fusion processes .",
    "the various triple vector boson production options will be made publicly available soon  @xcite .",
    "the program allows for the calculation of cross sections and distributions in either @xmath10 , @xmath27 or @xmath28 collisions of arbitrary center of mass energy . in the following , we present results on @xmath11 and @xmath12 production at the lhc , i.e.  for @xmath10 collisions at @xmath29  tev .",

    "this can be understood by a comparison with the factorization - scale induced lo variation given in fig .  [",
    "fig : scalezzw ] .",
    "under variation of @xmath40 , the virtual contribution shows the same behavior as the lo cross section , which means that the cross section decreases for small scales . under variation of @xmath41 , on the other hand , the finite part of the virtual contribution increases for small scales , due to the increase in @xmath47 .",

    "these are also responsible for the large scale dependence of the overall real - emission term in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : wp_3mw ] .",
    "this is not surprising since gluon - initiated subprocesses open up for the first time at nlo , and therefore , a lo - type scale dependence is expected .",
