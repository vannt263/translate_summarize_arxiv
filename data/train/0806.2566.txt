    "the spin-1/2 quantum heisenberg model on the diamond chain has enjoyed a considerable research interest since two unusual tetramer - dimer and dimer - monomer phases were theoretically predicted by takano _",
    "et al_. @xcite as a consequence of the mutual interplay between quantum fluctuations and geometric frustration .",
    "another stimulus for investigating diamond chain models was triggered by a recent discovery of molecular solids @xmath2 @xcite , @xmath3 @xcite , @xmath4 @xcite , which represent possible experimental realizations of the diamond chain compounds .",
    "motivated by these experiments , several phenomenological models have been suggested and solved with the aim to bring insight into a frustrated magnetism of the diamond chain compounds ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in the present work",
    ", we will develop an exact analytical treatment for the mixed spin-@xmath0 and spin-@xmath1 ising - heisenberg diamond chain that should clarify how the geometric frustration influences a possible magnetization scenario .",
    "let us write the total hamiltonian of the mixed spin-@xmath0 and spin-@xmath1 ising - heisenberg diamond chain as a sum over plaquette hamiltonians @xmath5 , where each plaquette hamiltonian @xmath6 involves all the interaction terms included within @xmath7th diamond - shaped plaquette @xmath8 here , @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote spatial components of the spin-@xmath0 and spin-@xmath1 operators , the parameter @xmath11 labels the isotropic antiferromagnetic interaction between the nearest - neighbouring heisenberg spins and the parameter @xmath12 accounts for the antiferromagnetic ising - type interaction between the heisenberg spins and their nearest ising neighbours .",
    "the last two terms determine the magnetostatic zeeman s energy of the ising and heisenberg spins in an external magnetic field @xmath13 and @xmath14 oriented along the @xmath15-axis .",
    "exact solution for the aforedescribed ising - heisenberg diamond chain can be obtained by combining three exact analytical techniques : the kambe projection method @xcite , the generalized decoration - iteration transformation @xcite and the transfer - matrix method @xcite .",
    "first , let us take advantage of a commutation relation between different plaquette hamiltonians @xmath16 = 0 $ ] valid for each @xmath17 to partially factorize the partition function @xmath18 here , @xmath19",

    ", it is necessary to perform a trace over spin degrees of freedom of two heisenberg spins from @xmath7th diamond plaquette as indicated by the symbol @xmath24 shown on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) . this calculation",
    "can easily be accomplished by making use of the kambe projection method @xcite , since the hamiltonian @xmath6 can also be viewed as the hamiltonian of the spin-@xmath1 heisenberg dimer in the effective field @xmath25 .",
    "consequently , the complete set of eigenvalues @xmath26 corresponding to the plaquette hamiltonian @xmath6 can be expressed solely as a function of two quantum spin numbers @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 which determine the total quantum spin number of the spin-@xmath1 heisenberg dimer and its projection towards the @xmath15-axis . according to the basic laws of quantum mechanics , the total quantum spin number of the spin-3/2 dimer gains four different values @xmath30 , while the quantum spin number @xmath28 gains @xmath31 different values @xmath32 for each allowed value of @xmath27 .",
    "the energy eigenvalues ( [ eq3 ] ) can be then used to obtain the relevant trace of the last expression on rhs of eq .",

    "( [ eq4 ] ) as it does not basically change physics of the studied system .",
    "it should be mentioned , however , that the decoration - iteration transformation ( [ eq4 ] ) must hold for arbitrary combination of spins states of two ising spins @xmath35 and @xmath36 involved therein .",
    "this self - consistency condition unambiguously determines so far not specified mapping parameters @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xmath40 which can be uniquely expressed through the functions @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where @xmath43 \\cosh[\\beta m ( j_{\\rm i } x + h_{\\rm h } ) ] . \\label{eq6 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is easy to verify that the transformation ( [ eq4 ] ) establishes a precise mapping relationship between the mixed spin-1/2 and spin-@xmath1 ising - heisenberg diamond chain and its corresponding spin-1/2 ising linear chain with the nearest - neighbour coupling @xmath38 and the effective magnetic field @xmath39 given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) . a direct substitution of the mapping transformation ( [ eq4 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) actually connects partition functions of both these models through the relation @xmath44 it is noteworthy that the partition function @xmath45 of the spin-1/2 ising linear chain can simply be attained with the help of the transfer - matrix method ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite ) and thus , our exact calculation is formally completed . in this respect , the mapping relation ( [ eq7 ] ) can also be used to obtain exact results for the helmholtz free energy @xmath46 and subsequently , both the sublattice magnetization @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "now , let us step forward to a discussion of the most interesting numerical results obtained for magnetization process . before doing so , it is useful to mention that magnetic properties of the frustrated ising - heisenberg diamond chain with other two particular values of the heisenberg spins @xmath49 and @xmath50 have been detailed discussed in our previous work  @xcite .",
    "the main objective of the present work is therefore to investigate magnetization curves of the mixed spin-@xmath0 and spin-@xmath1 ising - heisenberg diamond chain , which should serve for the sake of comparison with the recently published results @xcite and would shed light on how the scenario of magnetization process depends on a magnitude of the heisenberg spins .    to simplify further discussion ,",
    "let us first rescale all interaction parameters with respect to the ising - type interaction @xmath51 by introducing the following set of dimensionless parameters : @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 as describing a strength of the geometric frustration , external field and temperature , respectively .",
    "the total magnetization [ @xmath55 together with both sublattice magnetization @xmath56 and @xmath57 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mh ] against the reduced magnetic field for several values of the frustration parameter @xmath58 .",
    "as one can see , we have altogether found six different types of magnetization curves .",
    "if the frustration parameter is @xmath59 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : mh](a ) ] , there exists just a single intermediate magnetization plateau before the magnetization tends towards its saturation value . on the other hand , two or three intermediate magnetization plateaus",
    "can be observed provided that the frustration parameter is from the interval @xmath60 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : mh](b ) ] or @xmath61 [ see figs .  [",
    "fig : mh](c)(f ) ] , respectively .",
    "it is quite obvious from this analysis that the geometric frustration can be regarded as the driving force behind appearance of the greather number of intermediate magnetization plateaus .",
    "it is worthwhile to remark that the identified magnetization plateaus appear at @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 of the saturation magnetization when normalizing the total magnetization with respect to its saturation value .",
    "all these fractional values are in accordance with the oshikawa - yamanaka - affeck rule  @xcite , which has been proposed as a necessary condition for the formation of quantized plateaus . as it could be readily understood from the relevant results for the sublattice magnetization",
    ", the spin arrangements emerging at intermediate plateau regions with the same value of the total magnetization might significantly differ .",
    "however , the precise nature of spin arrangements to emerge at different plateau regions requires a more comprehensive analysis of the ground - state phase diagram , which is left as a challenging task for our future work .",
    "it should be also mentioned that the stepwise magnetization curves with an abrupt change(s ) of the magnetization observable at critical fields occur merely at zero temperature , while there are no real magnetization jumps at any finite temperatures .",
    "it turns out , however , that the magnetization curve exhibits a rather rapid continuous increase in the vicinity of critical fields whenever the temperature is set sufficiently small .",
    "contrary to this , the magnetization curves are gradually smeared out when the temperature is raised from zero and consequently , the plateau structure gradually diminishes from the magnetization curves above @xmath65 .",

    "it is noteworthy , moreover , that the developed exact analytical treatment can be rather easily generalized to account for the magnetization scenario of the mixed spin-@xmath0 and spin-@xmath73 ising - heisenberg diamond chain , which will be dealt with in our subsequent more comprehensive study ."
