    "the positive - delay region is always a subset of the capacity region .",
    "it is easy to construct a network with zero - delay nodes whose capacity region is strictly larger than the positive - delay region .",

    "node  1 and node  2 transmit @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively , and they receive @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively .",
    "all the input and output alphabets are binary , and the channel that carries @xmath2 to node  2 is a binary symmetric channel ( bsc ) while the channel that carries @xmath3 to node  1 is a discrete memoryless channel ( dmc ) whose output may depend on the output of the bsc . in this network ,",

    "other mmns whose capacity regions are strictly larger than their positive - delay regions include the _ relay - without - delay channel _ studied by el  gamal _ et al_.  @xcite and the _ causal relay network _ studied by baik and chung @xcite . in other words , for some mmns with zero - delay nodes , their capacity regions can be strictly larger than their positive - delay regions , which motivates us to classify the set of mmns with zero - delay nodes into the following two categories :    ( i ) : :    _ delay - independent mmns _ whose capacity regions coincide with their    positive - delay regions . (",
    "ii ) : :    _ delay - dependent mmns _ whose capacity regions are strictly larger than    their positive - delay regions .    for each mmn in category  ( i ) , the set of achievable rate tuples does not depend on the delay amounts incurred by the nodes in the network .",
    "on the other hand , for each mmn in category  ( ii ) , the set of achievable rate tuples shrinks if we impose the additional constraint that each node incurs a positive delay .",
    "it is important to decide which category a given mmn belongs to because the category of the mmn affects how the delays should be handled and how the transmissions in the network should be synchronized to achieve optimal performance .      the main contributions of this work are identification of three classes of delay - independent mmns and complete characterizations of their capacity regions .",
    "the first class is called the _ deterministic mmn dominated by product distribution_. being a subclass of mmns consisting of deterministic channels , the deterministic mmn dominated by product distribution is a generalization of the deterministic relay network with no interference in @xcite and the finite - field linear deterministic network in @xcite .",
    "the second class is the _ mmn consisting of independent dmcs _ @xcite .",
    "the third class is the _ wireless erasure network _ @xcite .",
    "we successfully evaluate the capacity regions for the above classes of mmns with zero - delay nodes and show that their capacity regions coincide with their positive - delay regions , which implies that the above classes of mmns belong to the category of delay - independent mmns .",
    "a natural consequence of our result is that for any mmn belonging to one of the above three classes , using different methods for handling delays and synchronization in the network does not affect the capacity region .    given a mmn with zero - delay nodes belonging to one of the above three classes , in order to show its delay - independence , we first evaluate an achievable rate region for the mmn by invoking the noisy network coding ( nnc ) inner bound ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  1 ) ( which was also discovered in @xcite ) .",
    "the achievable rate region is contained in the positive - delay region because the nnc inner bound was proved in @xcite for classical mmns .",
    "then , we evaluate an outer bound on the capacity region of the mmn with zero - delay nodes by simplifying the cut - set outer bound in ( * ? ? ? * theorem  1 ) and show that the cut - set outer bound coincides with the nnc inner bound ( which is within the positive - delay region ) , implying that the mmn is delay - independent .    this work should not be confused with the work by effros @xcite , which shows that under the classical model which assumes a positive delay at every node , the set of achievable rate tuples for any mmn does not depend on the amount of positive delay incurred by each node . here , we prove a different result for the above classes of mmns with zero - delay nodes that their capacity regions and positive - delay regions are the same .",
