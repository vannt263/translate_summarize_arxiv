    "it is inevitable that causality will provide constraints on the formation of domains after a continuous transition .",
    "although , adiabatically , correlation lengths diverge , the finite speed at which the order parameter can adjust to the changing environment guarantees that correlation lengths remain finite for transitions implemented in finite times . assuming that systems do change as fast as they can , kibble @xcite and zurek @xcite predicted simple scaling behaviour for the maximum correlation length of the order parameters of the early universe and condensed matter systems respectively , as a function of the cooling rate .",
    "domain formation , the frustration of the order parameter fields , is often visible through topological defects , typically vortices , which mediate between different equivalent ground states .",
    "since defects are , in principle , observable , they provide an excellent experimental tool for confirming this scaling behaviour , insofar as the defect separation can be correlated directly to the order parameter .",
    "several experiments have been performed to measure defect density that support the kz scaling behaviour under this assumption @xcite , which we term the kibble - zurek scenario , or are commensurate with its predictions @xcite . in this paper",
    "we give a critical reappraisal of the kibble - zurek ( kz ) scenario or , more accurately , scenarios .",
    "there are several different ways to derive causal bounds on defect densities .",
    "although they agree numerically for simple systems , they differ conceptually in their assumption as to how the length scale that determines the defect separation arises .",
    "the main distinction is whether this is set when the system freezes in _ before _ the transition or when the system relaxes _",
    "after _ the transition has begun .    in this paper we shall show that despite the fact that the correlation length freezes in _ before _ the transition , this value does not determine the density of defects upon their appearance , contrary to the standard formulation of causal bounds .",
    "as we shall see , the defect density is determined entirely by what happens _",
    "after _ the transition has begun . this latter point has been argued by one of us ( rr ) over many years @xcite in the context of analytic approximations and by moro and lythe @xcite using numerical simulations to supplement similar analytic results but , we feel , can benefit from the explicit demonstration that we give here .",
    "it is also timely in that the first experiments @xcite are being performed that show that the defect density depends on what happens _",
    "after _ the transition .",
    "we shall turn to these in our concluding section .",
    "to be specific , consider a system with critical temperature @xmath0 , cooled through that temperature so that , if @xmath1 is the temperature at time @xmath2 , then @xmath3 . @xmath4 defines the quench time @xmath5 .",
    "the adiabatic correlation length @xmath6 diverges near @xmath7 but the true correlation length @xmath8 remains finite .",
    "the standard formulation of the kz scenario is that the correlation length @xmath9 that characterizes the onset of order is the equilibrium correlation length @xmath10 at some appropriate time @xmath11 _ before _ the transition is implemented .",
    "the argument goes as follows ; at time @xmath2 there is a maximum speed @xmath12 at which the system can order itself . in the early universe",
    "this is the constant speed of light , in superfluid @xmath13 , say , the speed of second sound , vanishing at @xmath14 .",
    "[ whether there is critical slowing down or not is irrelevant .",
    "] > from this we can define a relaxation time @xmath15 . the earliest suggestion , due to zurek , is that , initially , for @xmath16 some way before the transition , the system behaves adiabatically",
    ". however , the system freezes in ( the impulse region ) at time @xmath17 , where @xmath18 i.e. when the time to the transition matches the relaxation time .",
    "it is proposed that the correlation length @xmath19 frozen out at this time will determine the domain size at the transition .",
    "the argument due to kibble is even simpler ; @xmath8 can not grow faster than @xmath20 . if @xmath21 until the system can not keep up with the cooling , the time @xmath22 at which the system freezes in is defined by the condition @xmath23 for simple systems both estimates of @xmath24 agree , to give the allometric form @xcite @xmath25 the scaling exponent @xmath26 depends on the ( adiabatic ) critical behaviour of the system as @xmath27 , and @xmath28 depends on the microscopic properties of the system .",
    "in addition to considering relaxation times before the event zurek also invoked @xcite causal horizons _",
    "after _ the event to obtain causal bounds . at time",
    "@xmath2 the causal horizon in which the order parameter can be correlated is @xmath29 > from this viewpoint our horizon bound for the earliest time @xmath30 that we can see defects is when @xmath31 becomes larger than the coherence length @xmath32 .",
    "that is , the causal horizon is big enough to hold a classical defect , @xmath33 the correlation length is then @xmath34 .    a parallel case that the relevant time for setting @xmath35 is _ after _ the transition can be made for kibble s analysis , by saying that the impulse regime will give way to the adiabatic regime once @xmath36 and it is this that determines the relevant @xmath24 .",
    "insofar as @xmath32 is symmetric , this gives the same @xmath37 as in ( [ tbar2 ] ) .",
    "again , both estimates ( [ tbar3 ] ) and ( [ tbar4 ] ) for @xmath30 agree , to give @xmath38 where the scaling exponent @xmath39 depends now on the ( adiabatic ) critical behaviour of the system as @xmath27 .    for continuous @xmath40 the scaling exponents @xmath41 are equal , when both exist . as a result ( [ xibar < ] ) and ( [ xibar > ] )",
    "are conflated as @xmath42 , the kz _ scaling law_.    in either formulation kibble and zurek then make the second assumption , that the relevant @xmath35 sets the initial scale of the defect network , with defect separation @xmath43 .    in this paper",
    "we shall show that despite the fact that the correlation length freezes in at @xmath35 satisfying ( [ xibar < ] ) , this does not fix the density of defects .",
    "instead , the density is determined by the growth of instabilities after the transition , which essentially matches ( [ xibar > ] ) without invoking causality directly , although all evolution is , inevitably , causal .",
    "we will consider a simple model in 1 + 1 dimensions that has been used as a first step in several studies of defect formation @xcite .",
    "this model is easily amenable to numerical simulation and leads to the correct scaling laws for the defect density . in a future publication",
    "we will deal with systems with larger number of spatial dimensions .",
    "nevertheless we expect the results discussed below and the analytical estimates behind these to generalize to higher dimensions .    specifically , we consider the following langevin equation , describing a time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) field theory : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a gaussian noise term obeying @xmath46 in one dimension @xmath47 , @xmath48 measures the amplitude of the noise , and its square quantifies the dissipative effects .",
    "this relation between the amplitudes of the noise and the dissipative term ensure that the fluctuation - dissipation condition is satisfied and that for very long times the system should eventually reach thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath49 .",
    "this tdgl model is motivated empirically for overdamped ( large @xmath48 ) condensed matter systems but , even in their idealised form , we would expect relativistic field theories to have non - linear noise arising from their environments .",
    "however , we have shown elsewhere that scaling behaviour is , essentially , independent of the linearity or non - linearity of the noise and we stick with ( [ eom ] ) .",
    "we start by presenting a simplified analytic argument supporting the assumption that the correlation length does freeze in before the transition , as anticipated by kibble and zurek .",
    "this will also help clarifying the reason why this scale does not necessarily set the value of the final defect density . in the simplest version of the model , the mass term",
    "is decreased linearly in time from an initial positive value @xmath50 as @xmath51 for @xmath52 the mass term is set to constant @xmath50 . for values of time larger ( smaller ) than @xmath53 ( @xmath54 )",
    "the mass term is set to constant @xmath55 ( @xmath50 ) .    to understand how the system does freeze in at time @xmath17 , for @xmath16 non - linear excitations have not had time to grow and it is sufficient to set @xmath56 in ( [ eom ] ) . for reasons of familiarity",
    "it is convenient to extend the ( now linear ) equation to three space dimensions for @xmath16 .",
    "the field correlation function @xmath57 is expressible as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the _ power _ in the fluctuations of wave - vector @xmath60 .",
    "the solutions to ( [ eom ] ) are given in terms of airy functions and their generalisations , and are messy without being very informative ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is sufficient , for illustrative purposes , to restrict ourselves to the case of strong dissipation , whereby airy functions become exponentials .",
    "as we have shown before @xcite , for strong damping , @xmath61 up to an irrelevant renormalisation . in turn , this gives @xmath62 @xmath63    it is not difficult to see that , for @xmath64 large enough , @xmath65 \\label{longr}\\ ] ] in this case . in ( [ longr ] )",
    "@xmath66 is , indeed , the correlation length that follows from ( [ tbar1 ] ) and ( [ tbar2 ] ) above and @xmath67 .",
    "what is important here is that the correlation length @xmath66 is determined from the position of the nearest singularity in the complex @xmath68-plane of the integral ( [ g ] ) after performing the angular integrations or , equivalently , from the _ large - distance _ behaviour of the correlation function .",
    "the reason why , both for this and the more general case of arbitrary @xmath48 , this length does not set the scale for the density of defects is that defects are identified by the field zeroes at their cores when they are formed at @xmath69 .",
    "initially , prior to @xmath7 , there are zeroes on all scales .",
    "however , once the transition begins to get under way , the instabilities in the long wavelength modes of the field lead to exponential growth in long wavelength amplitudes that orders the fields .",
    "insofar that we can persist with the linearized system after the transition , the separation of zeroes @xmath70 at the formation of defects is @xcite @xmath71 where dashes denote differentiation with respect to @xmath64 .",
    "that is , the information comes entirely from the _ short distance _ behaviour of @xmath72 for @xmath69 , rather than the long - distance behaviour that determined @xmath73 of ( [ longr ] ) for @xmath74 .",
    "it is determined by the second moment of the power spectrum , rather than its analytic structure .",
    "it happens that , in mean - field theory at least , @xmath70 of ( [ shortr ] ) can have the same scaling behaviour as @xmath75 of ( [ xibar > ] ) , that would be obtained from ( [ tbar3 ] ) and ( [ tbar4 ] ) .",
    "there are only logarithmic corrections to the scaling laws , provided thermal fluctuations , that introduce a further length scale ( the ginzburg correlation length ) are unimportant @xcite .",
    "the work of @xcite shows just how reliable this analytic approximation is , provided transients are taken into account .",
    "for this type of quench , we expect that some time after @xmath53 the field should settle to a series of alternating positive and negative vacuum regions .",
    "these regions will be separated by the topological defects of the theory , kinks and anti - kinks interpolating between the opposite vacua .",
    "the defects will then enter a regime of slow evolution with pair annihilation taking place at long times . during this stage of the evolution",
    "there is a one - to - one correspondence between kinks and anti - kinks and zeros of the scalar field @xmath76 , making it trivial to identify them numerically .",
    "depending on the value of the dissipation coefficient @xmath77 , we expect that the final density of defects @xmath78 will scale with different powers of the quench time scale . for high dissipation",
    "the system is effectively first - order in time , whereas for low @xmath48 the second derivative dominates the evolution and the system behaves in a relativistic fashion . assuming that the final defect density is of the order of the inverse of the freeze - out correlation length , @xmath79 should scale as @xmath80 .",
    "as discussed extensively in the literature and verified numerically for this model @xcite , the exponent is given by @xmath81 in the dissipative regime , and @xmath82 in the relativistic case .",
    "we will now look at variations of the quench model described above in which we modify the basic system so that the properties of the quench are qualitatively different before and after the transition takes place at @xmath7 . by measuring the final defect densities and determining the corresponding scaling powers",
    ", we will be able to determine which period of the evolution dictates the outcome .",
    "though transitions such as envisaged here are unlikely to be realisable in a physical situation , such scenarios are useful as idealized experiments .",
    "we stress that our primary concern here is with a matter of principle , given the general acceptance of the kz scenario in its original form .",
    "nevertheless , as we will discuss below , experimental results in transitions in josephson junctions can be understood in terms of distinct behaviours of the system before and after the transition .",
    "as already mentioned , the value of the dissipation in equation ( [ eom ] ) determines the scaling power of the final density of defects . in the first variation",
    "we will rely on this fact to discriminate between the effects of the two main stages of the quench on the final outcome .",
    "the idea is to allow @xmath48 to take two distinct values , @xmath83 for @xmath16 and @xmath84 for @xmath69 , characterizing the dissipation and the thermal noise before and after the transition respectively .",
    "if @xmath85 and @xmath86 are values typical of different regimes ( under and over - damped and vice - versa ) for @xmath16 and @xmath69 respectively , the measured value of @xmath87 should reflect the relevant period of the evolution .    the numerical procedure used in this work follows very closely that of @xcite .",
    "we will outline it here briefly and refer the reader to the aforementioned publication for a more detailed description .",
    "the parameters of the potential are @xmath88 and @xmath89 and the bath temperature @xmath49 is set to a low value , typically @xmath90 . for every fixed choice of @xmath85 and @xmath86 a set of quenches is performed with @xmath91 , @xmath92 and the final defect density is obtained by counting zeros of the field at a final time , defined as a multiple of @xmath53 .",
    "this approach to determining the final kink number leads to slight discrepancies in the estimate of @xmath87 in the extreme high / low - dissipation cases .",
    "these are nevertheless easily controlled @xcite and as we will see below the accuracy obtained is more than sufficient for the needs of the present work . finally , we perform a fit of the final defect density versus @xmath53 to a power law and thus obtain the scaling exponent @xmath87 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the results for a case where the evolution before the transition is well in the under - damped regime . in @xcite",
    "we showed that for this specific model , the transition between the two types of evolution takes place at about @xmath93 .",
    "the two values of @xmath94 used here are both comfortably below @xmath95 . in both cases",
    "we allow @xmath86 to vary between @xmath96 and @xmath97 , covering a part of the over - damped region of parameter space . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the results show clearly that the scaling parameter @xmath87 is determined exclusively by the value of @xmath86 .",
    "the result for the scaling exponent is unmistakably typical of the over - damped regime , despite the fact the part of the evolution was under - damped",
    ". not only that , but the precise value of @xmath87 does not seem to affected by @xmath85 . within the error bars , the curves obtained are indistinguishable from the case where the dissipation is kept constant , and equal to @xmath86 , throughout the transition .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the results for the opposite situation .",
    "here we kept the dissipation _ after _ the transition constant and in the under - damped regime , while keeping @xmath85 in the over - damped region .",
    "the measured @xmath87 is constant within error bars , and has a value typical of an under - damped evolution .",
    "the values of the scaling power for a quench with constant @xmath48 set to @xmath98 and @xmath99 are @xmath100 and @xmath101 respectively .",
    ", the typical value for the under - damped regime , a consequence of saturation phenomena @xcite . ] as in the previous example , the values shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] coincide with these .",
    "once again this strongly suggests that the outcome is determined exclusively by the period of the quench taking place after the phase transition .    for our second example",
    "we take a more radical departure from the original model ( [ eom ] ) .",
    "while maintaining the dissipation at a constant value throughout the whole evolution , we change the rate of the quench at @xmath7 . for negative times the squared mass term @xmath102 will go from @xmath50 at @xmath103 to zero at @xmath7 . for @xmath69",
    "an alternative quench rate is introduced , with @xmath102 decreasing linearly and reaching @xmath55 for @xmath104 . as in the previous section",
    ", we expect the outcome to reflect the relative importance of the two periods of the evolution .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show the results for two cases , with @xmath48 in the under - damped and over - damped region respectively . for both sets of simulations , @xmath105 was kept constant at a value @xmath106 for fixed @xmath107 whilst @xmath108 was varied throughout the usual range , with @xmath109 . if the final number of defects were determined by @xmath105 we should observe no scaling , with a constant number of defects being obtained at the end of each simulation .",
    "instead , we found that the final density clearly scales with @xmath110 , with a power that is determined by the magnitude of @xmath48 .",
    "as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the value of the scaling power changes very little with the quench rate at negative time .",
    "for the two choices of @xmath111 , the exponents for the basic quenches with @xmath112 are @xmath113 and @xmath114 respectively .",
    "the measured @xmath87 s lie very near these , confirming that the @xmath69 part of the evolution is the dominant one . as an extra check we simulated the reversed situation where @xmath115 was kept fixed and",
    "@xmath107 was allowed to vary in the usual range .",
    "as expected the final defect density was constant within error bars , showing no dependence on the value of @xmath105 for negative times .",
    "once again this highlights the fact that the mechanism of defect formation is dictated by what happens after the transition takes place , in variance with some of the arguments of @xcite .",
    "if there had been any doubt before , we have shown conclusively that defect density is controlled by the cooling of the system after the critical temperature has been passed .",
    "it is true that correlation lengths do freeze in before the transition .",
    "however , their defining long - distance behaviour is irrelevant to defect densities , which are controlled by the short - distance behaviour that determines field zeroes .    as we have stressed , transitions with discretely different behaviour before and after the critical temperature of the type that we have examined are unlikely to have direct physical counterparts .",
    "however , the transitions in josephson junctions provide a more subtle example where behaviour before and after the transition is very different . before the conductor - superconductor transition we have two bulk conductors , individually amenable to the zurek analysis of freezing in of correlation lengths @xcite . for these , ( [ xibar < ] ) is appropriate , with @xmath116 .",
    "however , after the transition we have the josephson effect , for which field ordering is not determined by the behaviour of the individual superconductors , for which ( [ xibar < ] ) would have given an identical @xmath117 @xcite . instead , field ordering is constrained by the velocity of light in the oxide , the swihart velocity .",
    "naively , we could not easily distinguish between the two possibilities since , for idealised symmetric junctions this again gives the same scaling behaviour @xmath117 after the transition , albeit with a different prefactor .",
    "however , for realistic junctions proximity effects and only partial critical slowing - down @xmath116 enforce @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "empirically , the data is described well by the latter @xcite , and is not compatible with @xmath116 .",
