    "mesons offer a prime target for studies of various approaches to quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , which is widely accepted as the quantum field theory of the strong interaction . while in terms of the number of constitutents",
    "their appearance is simple at first glance , mesons provide a broad range of phenomena and challenges to both theory and experiment . on the theoretical side",
    "the key challenge is to understand mesons ( and hadrons in general ) as bound states of qcd s elementary degrees of freedom , quarks and gluons .",
    "the various approaches used to provide direct or indirect insight regarding this problem are ( relativistic ) quark models ( e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) , reductions of the bethe - salpeter equation ( e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) , lattice qcd ( e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) , effective field theories ( e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) , and the dyson - schwinger approach used herein . on the experimental side , present - day challenges can be exemplified by the recent measurement of the pseudoscalar ground - state mass in the bottomonium system @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "mesons are studied by means of qcds dyson - schwinger - equations ( dses ) ; for recent reviews , see @xcite .",
    "the dses are an infinite set of coupled and in general nonlinear integral equations for the green functions of a quantum field theory , which makes the approach fully nonperturbative .",
    "it can therefore be used to study prominent nonperturbative phenomena of qcd , namely dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and confinement , as well as bound states in a single framework .",
    "the latter are studied in this approach with the help of covariant equations . in particular , the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) is used to describe a meson as a quark - antiquark system in qcd @xcite . note that the analogous approach to baryons as systems of three spin-@xmath3 quarks is considerably more involved ; a first realization of this problem has been achieved only recently @xcite . in the past , intermediate steps have been taken to allow for the same level of sophistication as in corresponding meson studies ( for recent advances , see @xcite and references therein ) .    in principle one",
    "would aim at a complete , self - consistent solution of all equations , which is equivalent to a solution of the underlying theory . while this spirit can be held up in investigations of certain aspects of the theory ( see , e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) , numerical studies of hadronic observables require a truncation of the infinite tower of equations . in practice",
    "this means the choice of a subset of equations which are solved self - consistently by neglecting or making sophisticated anstze for the green functions whose dses are not solved explicitly .",
    "a popular truncation for meson studies in the dse approach , which is also used in this work , is the rainbow - ladder ( rl ) truncation for reasons of simplicity and for satisfying among others the axial - vector ward - takahashi identity ( avwti ) .",
    "the avwti is a welcome restriction of the unknown quark - antiquark scattering kernel in the bse and its satisfaction guarantees the correct implementation of chiral symmetry and its dynamical breaking . a possible symmetry - preserving nonperturbative truncation scheme @xcite contains the rl truncation as the lowest order , various corrections to which can be systematically included in studies `` beyond rl '' @xcite .",
    "another recent approach aims at the direct construction of the symmetry - preserving kernel of the bse from a general quark - gluon vertex @xcite . with chiral symmetry and its dynamical breaking correctly realized in this fashion and built into the calculation from the very beginning , one obtains a generalized gell - mann  oakes  renner relation valid for all pseudoscalar mesons and all current - quark masses @xcite .",
    "in particular , the pion becomes massless in the chiral limit .",
    "meson studies in such a setup have been carried out over a number of years with various levels of sophistication @xcite . among these different variants",
    "the setup of ref .",
    "@xcite has been successfully applied to the properties of pseudoscalar and vector meson ground states , in particular electromagnetic form factors ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "further applications include an exploratory study of hadronic meson decays @xcite , calculations of diquark properties @xcite ( since these correlations are of importance in baryon studies ) , and studies of radial meson excitations @xcite .",
    "while early studies were conducted for light mesons , an extension to heavy - heavy mesons seemed natural @xcite , but required a change of method , since reaching the @xmath1-quark mass @xcite is only possible with proper numerical treatment .    while many aspects of mesons with @xmath0 have been investigated separately , a comprehensive collection and discussion of the corresponding spectra is still missing . in the present work , as a first step ,",
    "meson masses are presented for mesons with equal mass constituents and all quantum numbers possible for @xmath0 for the cases of light , strange , charm , and bottom quark masses .",
    "the dependence of the masses on the parameters used in the interaction are explored throughout , which appears to be an important issue for any such calculation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "[ formalism ] lists the necessary ingredients for the calculation , the results are presented and discussed in sec .  [ results ] , conclusions are offered in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "the necessary details on the structure of the mesons bethe - salpeter amplitudes for all quantum numbers considered here are collected in an appendix .",
    "all calculations have been performed in euclidean momentum space .",
    "in rl truncation one studies a meson with total @xmath4 momentum @xmath5 and relative @xmath4 momentum @xmath6 by consistently solving two equations : the homogeneous , ladder - truncated @xmath4 bse @xmath7 and the rainbow - truncated quark dse @xmath8 solution of the bse yields the bethe - salpeter amplitude ( bsa ) @xmath9 , which is combined with two dressed quark propagators into what is commonly referred to as the `` bethe - salpeter wave function '' @xmath10 . in these equations",
    "dirac and flavor indices have been omitted for simplicity and the factor @xmath11 comes from the color trace .",
    "@xmath12 is the free gluon propagator , @xmath13 is the bare quark - gluon vertex , @xmath14 is an effective running coupling , and the ( anti)quark momenta are @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 $ ] is referred to as the momentum partitioning parameter , which is usually set to @xmath3 for systems of equal - mass constitutents .",
    "@xmath18 represents a translationally invariant regularization of the integral , with the regularization scale @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath20 denotes the quark self energy and @xmath21 the current - quark mass .",
    "the solution for the quark propagator @xmath22 requires a renormalization procedure , the details of which have been omitted for simplicity but can be found together with the general structure of both the bse and quark dse in @xcite .",
    "the inverse quark propagator has the general form @xmath23 .",
    "solving the two coupled integral equations for @xmath24 and @xmath25 , one obtains an input for the @xmath4 bse .",
    "in particular , in euclidean momentum space a solution of the bse for a bound - state of mass @xmath26 implies @xmath27 , which in turn requires knowledge of the quark propagator at the complex momenta @xmath28 .",
    "the corresponding arguments of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath29 , lie inside a parabola defined by the complex points @xmath30 and @xmath31 for @xmath32 ( for a more detailed discussion , see e.g.  app .",
    "a of ref .",
    "the analytic continuation required presents a considerable numerical challenge at large quark masses ( in practice for @xmath21 larger than the charm quark mass ) .",
    "the method used here is based on a strategy described in @xcite , which is further developed in @xcite with the help of a particularly useful and stable way to numerically evaluate cauchy s integral formula @xcite .",
    "to fully specify the items defined in eqs .",
    "( [ bse ] ) , ( [ dse ] ) one needs a form for the effective coupling @xmath33 , @xmath34 . here",

    "in @xcite they were fixed together with the current - quark mass @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ dse ] ) to the chiral condensate as well as the pion mass and leptonic decay constant .",
    "it emerges from the results presented there that the computed values for the chiral condensate , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 change very little , if one varies @xmath43 and @xmath42 such that their product remains constant and @xmath42 lies in the range @xmath48 $ ] gev . as a result ,",
    "one can interpret a setup with @xmath49 as a one - parameter model , which is essentially determined by the requirement to correctly implement chiral symmetry and its dynamical breaking as well as to obtain the chiral condensate and @xmath45 of the correct magnitude . to illustrate the difference in the coupling generated by the first term in eq .",
    "( [ coupling ] ) , fig .",
    "[ fig : c ] shows the corresponding curves for three values of @xmath42 ( and corresponding @xmath43 for the above interval boundaries and its center value ) .",
    "it is clear that the main difference between the curves lies in the low- and intermediate - momentum range , which corresponds to the long - range part of the interaction .    in the present study the same parameter range",
    "is investigated for mesons with all quantum numbers corresponding to spin 0 and 1 . while in @xcite the current - quark mass",
    "was slightly readjusted for each value of @xmath42 in order to achieve the exact same results for @xmath44 , this is not done here , since it obscures the influence of @xmath43 and @xmath42 on the spectrum , which is the main point of the investigation .",
    "the parameters are fixed here as follows : the above - mentioned range of @xmath50 $ ] gev is inherited from @xcite together with the value of @xmath51 used there .",
    "the remaining parameters , four current quark masses for the flavors @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath1 , are then each fixed to the corresponding experimental vector - meson ground - state mass .",
    "this last step is motivated by the fact that for heavy quarkonia , the vector state is the best - known experimentally . for the @xmath55 case , the vector state is again the better choice due to ideal @xmath56-flavor mixing in the vector case , since a corresponding pseudoscalar meson state does not appear experimentally and the rl - truncated bse kernel does not contain flavor - mixing processes . to make everything consistent , the light - quark mass",
    "is then fixed to the @xmath57 meson instead of the pion mass .",
    "equations ( [ bse ] ) and ( [ dse ] ) are solved consistently in rl truncation using the interaction of ref .",
    "as laid out in the introduction , this setup has been applied to numerous observables for pseudoscalar- and vector - meson ground states individually in the literature . in the present work ,",
    "the new aspect is a consistent treatment of all meson states with @xmath0 and a comprehensive study of the dependence of these states on the parameters @xmath43 and @xmath42 of the model , more precisely with the restriction mentioned above , namely @xmath49 as reported earlier in connection with radially excited states of pseudoscalar mesons in the same setup @xcite , such a study can be used to draw conclusions about the effective range and pointwise form of the long - range part of the strong interaction between , in particular , also light quarks .",
    "this is due to the observation that the @xmath42-independence observed for pseudoscalar- and vector - meson ground - state properties does not survive for radial excitations : for example , meson masses can vary by several hundred mev over the range @xmath50 $ ] gev ( see @xcite ) .",
    "basically , it would therefore be possible to use such excited states to fix all parameters in the interaction completely and attempt a quantitative study and comparison to other approaches / experimental data",
    ". however , this is not the aim here : the present study is almost purely qualitative .",
    "it focusses simply on the effect of the long - range part of the strong interaction , encoded in the parameters of the present model , on states with various quantum numbers and quark masses .",
    "results have been obtained for ground states with equal - mass constituents of each @xmath58 and @xmath59 channel , spanning the entire range from light to heavy quarks .",
    "( more generally , @xmath44 denotes the pseudoscalar - meson mass for a given current - quark mass ) .",
    "vertical dotted lines correspond to positions for light , strange , and charm @xmath60 states.[fig:1 ] ]    to illustrate the evolution of the various meson masses with the quark / pion mass , fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] shows the corresponding results of the calculation from the chiral limit to charmonium .",
    "the curves beyond that value continue to rise linearly as expected .",
    "the results for bottomonium are provided in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "two observations from fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] are noteworthy .",
    "firstly and most prominently , a comment on meson states with `` exotic '' quantum numbers is in order .",
    "meson states with such quantum numbers , which are not available for a @xmath60 state in quantum mechanics , appear naturally in a quark - antiquark bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "for example , @xmath61 states have previously been studied and discussed using a separable bse kernel in @xcite and , for light quark masses , also using the interaction of ref .",
    "@xcite in @xcite .",
    "here they are included for completeness with the immediate remark that corrections to the masses of these states can be expected to be at least of the same order of magnitude as those for axial - vector mesons , whose masses are underestimated by several hundred mev .",
    "still , for the purpose of fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , their inclusion reveals interesting analogies discussed below .    .",
    "dotted lines correspond to experimental data @xcite .",
    "note that there is no flavor mixing in rl truncation , i.e.  there is no experimental number for an @xmath55 pseudoscalar meson decay constant .",
    "furthermore , measurements for the @xmath62 decay constant have not yet been reported.[fig:3 ] ]    the other observation from fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] to be made here is that the ( purely rl-@xmath60 ) scalar state lies below the vector state in the chiral limit ; the two switch positions at about the strange - quark mass , beyond which they confirm with the ordering observed experimentally .",
    "due to the complicated situation for scalar mesons as well as the simplicity of rl truncation , a meaningful quantitative comparison of the scalar result at light quark masses with experimental data is beyond the present study .",
    "figure [ fig:2 ] provides the essential information for the conclusions presented from this study .",
    "it contains all results for meson states with @xmath58 and @xmath59 for the four relevant values of the quark mass as functions of the model parameter @xmath42 .",
    "as has been mentioned above and is apparent from the figure , the vector - meson masses have been fixed to the corresponding experimental values for the central value of @xmath42 . in accordance with the original observation in @xcite , pseudoscalar and vector masses depend on @xmath42 only very slightly .",
    "it should be stressed again here that the quark masses were not refitted for different values of @xmath42 in order not to obscure the @xmath42 dependence of the state . in a quark - model interpretation , with the quark - antiquark orbital angular momentum denoted by @xmath63 , pseudoscalar and vector states",
    "correspond ( mainly ) to @xmath64 states , whereas all other states under consideration here have higher @xmath63 and are therefore orbital excitations ; the exotics are constructed using addtional gluonic degrees of freedom and thus correspond to excitations as well .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that all other states in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] share the characteristic @xmath42 dependence of radial excitations demostrated earlier @xcite .",
    "an additional aspect of exotic states is helpful in understanding this : they are in fact radial excitations of their non - exotic counterparts in a more general setup where the restriction on a particular @xmath65 parity is lifted .    with this overall picture in mind , it is clear that quantitative studies in this approach must explore the parameter dependence of the results on their respective interaction .",
    "this , in turn , can lead to conclusions about the pointwise form of that interaction .    as a further illustration , fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] shows the @xmath42 dependence of the pseudoscalar- and vector - meson leptonic decay constants for all quark masses together with experimental data , where known . more precisely , there are no experimental numbers for @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "note that there is a @xmath68 mev error bar on the measurement of @xmath69 @xcite , which is not indicated in the figure .",
    "observations from this figure are similar to those from fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , namely that the @xmath42 dependence of pseudoscalar- and vector- meson properties in this setup is small .",
    "an interesting detail is that the calculated results show @xmath70 while for all lower states the vector decay constant is larger than the pseudoscalar .",
    "however , since the disagreement with the experimental number for @xmath71 is rather large , also this result should be interpreted cautiously and in the context of the present qualitative study .",
    "this paper presents a qualitative overview of meson spectra and decay constants for spins @xmath0 for a sophisticated model of qcd using a rainbow truncation of the quark dse and the ladder quark - antiquark bse . beyond various studies of aspects of meson properties in this setup existent in the literature ,",
    "the results presented here are comprehensive over the whole range of quark masses from the chiral limit up to the bottom quark and for all quantum numbers possible for @xmath0 including so - called `` exotic '' ones , which appear naturally in a bethe - salpeter treatment of the quark - antiquark system .",
    "furthermore , the results dependence on the model parameters is explored systematically .",
    "the results show a pattern where states corresponding mainly to @xmath64 in the quark model show only a slight sensitivity to the long - range part of the strong interaction , whereas those corresponding to @xmath72 or with exotic quantum numbers show a clear dependence , which is analogous to that discovered previously for radial meson excitations . as a consequence",
    ", all excitations can be related to the long - range details or form of the interaction under consideration , which in principle can allow a pointwise investigation of that interaction and makes these states a prime object for further studies .",
    "here only states with equal - mass constituents were studied .",
    "subsequent investigations in this approach will , among other things , deal with higher spin states as well as states with unequal - mass constituents ; in particular heavy - light systems are of interest , since they combine the two regimes of heavy and light quarks in a unique fashion , thus offering an opportunity to also study in the same detail the interaction between quarks of light and heavy masses .",
    "the bsa @xmath73 of a meson as a bound state of a quark - antiquark pair depends on their total momentum @xmath5 as well as the relative momentum @xmath74 .",
    "the appearance of the lorentz index @xmath75 is related to the spin @xmath76 of the meson : for @xmath77 , the amplitude has no index , for @xmath78 there is @xmath75 . in terms of lorentz - invariant variables ,",
    "the amplitudes depend on @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 .",
    "the spin structure is taken into account by the fact that @xmath82 is a @xmath83 matrix in spinor space @xcite .",
    "the corresponding basis can be built from products of dirac-@xmath84 matrices .",
    "the general dependence of the bsa on these variables can be written in terms of @xmath85 covariant structures @xmath86 and scalar amplitudes @xmath87 ; @xmath88 : @xmath89 note that for a bound - state amplitude  the solution of a homogeneous bse  the the on - shell condition requires @xmath27 to be fixed .",
    "however , one varies @xmath79 in the solution process of the homogeneous bse to find the above condition . in the corresponding inhomogeneous",
    "bse one has @xmath5 and therefore also @xmath79 as a completely independent variable .    for @xmath77 , i.e.  scalar or pseudoscalar mesons ,",
    "the bsa contains four independent covariant structures . for a scalar , on can choose @xmath90 where @xmath91 $ ] .",
    "note that these covariants are in general neither orthogonal nor normalized in terms of the two four - momenta @xmath74 and @xmath5 ( for example , one could have @xmath92 ) .",
    "the scalar product for general covariants is defined via the dirac trace @xmath93=t_{ij}f(i , j)\\;,\\ ] ] where for an orthogonal basis one has @xmath94 and @xmath95 are functions of @xmath80 , @xmath79 , and @xmath81 , and the sum over @xmath75 is carried out only for @xmath78 .    the scalar amplitudes @xmath96 depend on two independent variables , since the total momentum - squared @xmath79 is fixed for an on - shell meson .",
    "the relative - momentum squared @xmath80 corresponds to a radial variable in euclidean momentum space , while the scalar product @xmath81 can be understood in terms of the cosine @xmath97 of an angle between @xmath74 and @xmath5 by writing @xmath98 .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath87 can be decomposed by a chebyshev expansion as @xmath99 where @xmath100 are the chebyshev polynomials of the second kind and the @xmath101 are the corresponding chebyshev moments , which effectively only depend on @xmath80 .",
    "an illustration of ground- and excited - state pseudoscalar meson chebyshev moments can be found in @xcite .",
    "a scalar meson with equal - mass constituents has the quantum numbers @xmath102 .",
    "the bsa as defined above with the covariants for the scalar case has @xmath103 , but is not restricted _ a priori _ to either @xmath104 or @xmath105 .",
    "when using a momentum partitioning parameter of @xmath32 , one can obtain an amplitude with positive @xmath65-parity by restricting the @xmath65-parity for each @xmath87 according to the value of @xmath65 for the corresponding @xmath86 ( see also @xcite ) . for @xmath86 odd under @xmath65 one has to ensure that @xmath87 is odd as well .",
    "this is done via the dependence on @xmath81 , which is odd under @xmath65 . in the chebyshev expansion defined in eq .",
    "( [ cheby ] ) this means that for an even / odd @xmath106 one would keep only even / odd terms in the expansion . in this way , it is immediately clear how to construct an amplitude with the opposite , in some cases called `` unnatural '' charge - parity , namely by making all odd @xmath106s even and vice versa . in this way , the bse can be used to study mesons with `` exotic '' quantum numbers ( see also @xcite ) .    for the scalar basis",
    ", @xmath107 is odd under @xmath65 , the others are even . as a result",
    ", @xmath108 is an odd function of @xmath81 , the others are even . with the above choice of covariants ( and as mentioned above @xmath32 ) ,",
    "the chebyshev moments of @xmath108 are purely imaginary , the others are real",
    ". one could unify all covariants behavior by making the modification @xmath109 after which all covariants are even and all amplitudes real .",
    "it should be noted here that in a more general setup , which is e.g.  needed in the case of unequal - mass constituents , a restriction like the above is not possible , since such a state is not a @xmath65-parity eigenstate . in this case , both odd and even chebyshev moments will contribute in general , i.e.  the @xmath87 will be complex .",
    "however , in the limiting case of equal constituent masses , the real / imaginary pattern described above is recovered also numerically .",
    "the basis used for a pseudoscalar @xmath110 meson is @xmath111 where @xmath112 is odd under @xmath65 and the others are even . as a result ,",
    "for a state with @xmath113 , @xmath114 must be odd and the others even , and the opposite for the exotic @xmath115 .    for @xmath78",
    "one has 12 independent covariant structures in the bsa . since an on - shell ( axial-)vector meson is transverse ( i.e.  @xmath116 ) , 8 ( transverse ) covariants remain . with",

    "a @xmath121 state , @xmath114 and @xmath122 must be odd functions of @xmath81 , the others even .",
    "for the exotic @xmath123 state , the situation is reversed .    for the axialvector @xmath124 meson , the basis used",

    "@xmath112 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 are odd under @xmath65 ; to obtain @xmath128 one needs the corresponding amplitudes to be odd functions of @xmath81 , the others even .",
