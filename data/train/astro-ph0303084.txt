    "discovery of coherent oscillations with frequencies in the 300600 hz range during x - ray bursts from a number of low - mass x - ray binaries ( see strohmayer & bildsten 2003 for a review ) has triggered the efforts to use the information on the amplitude of variability and the folded pulse shape to put constraints on the compactness of the neutron star and thus its equation of state as well as the emission pattern from the neutron star surface ( e.g. miller & lamb 1998 ) .",
    "however , a rather limited photon statistics does not allow to reach a high accuracy ( strohmayer et al . 1997 ; nath , strohmayer & swank 2002 ; muno , zel & chakrabarty 2002 ) .",

    "the pulse profiles of  show strong energy dependence with soft photons lagging behind the hard ones ( soft phase lags , see cui et al .",
    "1998 ) . by analysing the phase - resolved spectra , gierliski , done & barret ( 2002 ) showed that this results from the fact that the two main spectral components , a soft black body and a hard comptonized , vary out of phase with the first lagging the last one .",
    "while the variations of the black body flux can be described by a single sine wave , the pulse of the hard comptonized component is strongly skewed .",

    "the radiation pattern of standard accreting x - ray pulsars is influenced by strong magnetic field @xmath13 g. on the other hand , the magnetic field of the accreting millisecond pulsars in low mass x - ray binaries is much weaker , @xmath14@xmath15 g ( see e.g. wijnands & van der klis 1998a ; psaltis & chakrabarty 1999 ) , and does not affect significantly properties of the emitted radiation . thus these sources can also serve as laboratories for studying radiative processes at the surface of weakly - magnetized neutron stars .    in this paper , we construct a detailed model for the x - ray emission from the surface of a rapidly rotating neutron star accounting for relativistic effects .",

    "accreting matter following the magnetic field lines close to the neutron star is stopped in the very vicinity of the surface by radiation producing radiation dominated shock ( basko & sunyaev 1976 ; lyubarskii & sunyaev 1982 ) . for the source luminosity of a few percent of the eddington luminosity ( gilfanov et al .",

    "we assume that all photons originate at the stellar surface ( i.e. the height of the emitting region is set to zero ) .",
    "we assume a circular spot and consider two extreme cases for the relative positions of the black body and the comptonizing regions : ( 1 ) a homogeneous slab , i.e. the hot comptonizing layer covering the whole black body spot , ( 2 ) a point  like comptonizing region in the centre of a black body region .    in order to compute the light curve as observed by a distant observer",

[ [ eq : bb ] ] ) , about 40 per cent of the black body area should be covered by the comptonizing medium with @xmath186 , while the remaining 60 per cent should emit as a pure black body ( i.e. with no @xmath187 reduction due to scattering ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that the radius of the comptonizing region @xmath188 is about 2 km .    the angular distributions of the scattered radiation ( see dashed curve in fig .",

    "model 2 is somewhat less restrictive and therefore gives generally better fits .",
    "the required emission pattern is certainly very much different from that given by the lambert law and more radiation is escaping at intermediate angles @xmath189 than along the normal .",
    "it is this pattern which is responsible for the origin of a strong first harmonic ( i.e. at double spin frequency ) in the pulsar light curve at high energies ( modified also by doppler effects , see fig .",

    ", we repeated the fitting procedure considering an extreme case with a point - like comptonizing source at the centre of the black body spot .",
    "the best - fitting parameters are similar to the situation where both emitting regions coincide .",
    "this is expected since the size of the emission region should not play a large role since @xmath190 . however , when estimating the size of the spot , we assumed the soft emission is a black body , i.e. the observed color temperature is equal to the effective temperature . for the hydrogen and helium atmospheres of weakly magnetized neutron stars",
    "one expects that the color correction is @xmath191@xmath192 ( zavlin , pavlov & shibanov 1996 ) .",
    "the shift of the peak of the emission towards higher energies from the corresponding black body emission results from the fact that the outer layers of the atmosphere are cooler than the deeper layers .",
    "since the bound - free and free - free cross - sections rapidly decrease with increasing photon energy , one sees deeper and hotter layers at high energies .",
    "however , when the accretion takes place and the radiative shock forms ( its existence is supported by the presence of the hard x - ray tail ) , the soft radiation can be produced by reprocessing the hard photons from the shock .",
    "the temperature gradient of the atmosphere then can be opposite to that of standard neutron star atmospheres .",
    "now the hot layers are at the top , softer photons are coming from the hotter region ( since absorption cross - section is large for small energies ) , while hard photons are coming from the cooler region below and the color correction can be smaller than unity .",
    "the actual vertical temperature dependence is however unknown .    to investigate the influence of different possible color corrections on our best - fitting parameters , we consider two extreme cases of @xmath193 and @xmath194 and fitted the data with model 2 .",
    "the area of the `` black body '' spot now changes by a factor @xmath195 . for @xmath193 ,",
    "the spot centre colatitude @xmath19 increases by about 20 per cent comparing to the case of no color correction .",
    "since now the spot is larger , @xmath19 has to increase to keep the same oscillation amplitude ( see eq .  [ [ eq : amplspot ] ] ) .",
    "the best - fitting stellar radius increases significantly only for the smallest considered mass of @xmath196 reaching @xmath197 km , for @xmath5 the radius is @xmath198 km , while for higher masses the change is negligible . in the case of @xmath199",
    "the spot becomes smaller and @xmath19 also slightly decreases . at @xmath196 the best - fitting radius is now @xmath200 km , while all other parameters remain the same within the errors .",
    "there is no change in the best - fitting parameters for higher stellar masses .",
    "this results from the fact that the light curve depends weakly on the spot size if it small comparing to the stellar radius ( see eqs  [ [ eq : fluxrho ] , [ eq : amplspot ] ] ) .",
    "one of the important assumptions that can affect our results is that the two emission components are assumed to be co - spatial or are at least co - centred . in our interpretation the comptonized emission peaks earlier than the black body due to a different angular distribution more affected by the doppler effect .",
    "however , an additional phase shift is possible if the comptonized emission region is physically shifted on the stellar surface .",
    "we fitted the data with model 2 and the phase shift @xmath201 of the comptonized emission as an additional free parameter .",
    "a major effect of adding a new parameter is that the confidence interval for the stellar radius increases .",
    "thus , for example , for @xmath202 , the best fit with @xmath203/dof@xmath204 was obtained for @xmath205 rad ( a positive shift corresponds to an earlier arrival time ) and other parameters very similar to those presented in table  [ table : fit ] , while the constraints on the radius weaken : @xmath206 ( 90 per cent confidence limits ) .",
    "an @xmath207-test gives @xmath208 which corresponds to a 7 per cent chance that the decrease in @xmath203 was random ( i.e. the improvement is not highly statistically significant ) .",
    "we show one of the fits to the pulse profiles with the fixed @xmath31 , @xmath22 , and @xmath32 in fig .",
    "[ fig : all]a . the corresponding intrinsic angular distribution of the radiation flux in the two spectral components is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : all]b .",
    "one sees a dramatic difference between the dependences of the black body and comptonized components .",
    "the observed energy dependence of the pulse profiles and the phase lags at the pulsar frequency between different energies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : all]c ) are reproduced reasonably well .",
    "a natural consequence of the model is that the phase lags change significantly at smaller energies together with the black body contribution to the total flux , while they reach a constant value at about 68 kev where the black body flux becomes negligible ( see also gierliski et al .",
    "2002 ) . since in reality",
    "the angular dependence of comptonization radiation _ is _ a function of energy , one would expect a weaker dependence of lags on energy even above 10 kev .",
    "let us consider first for simplicity the black body emission from a single spot . in that case , the doppler effect does not change significantly the light curve ( compare dashed and solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : relateff]a ) and thus it is mainly characterized by the amplitude @xmath209 that can be estimated for a slowly rotating star using equation ( [ eq : ampl ] ) . for a given @xmath111 ,",
    "the amplitude in its turn depends on @xmath22 and @xmath19 only .",
    "thus , at the @xmath210 plane we can determine a curve that would correspond to a given amplitude @xmath209 ( see solid curves in fig .  [",
    "fig : dopamrin]a ) .",
    "one notes that this curve is symmetric around the @xmath211 line since one can exchange @xmath22 and @xmath19 in the expression for @xmath209 ( see eqs  [ [ eq : ampl][eq : uq ] ] ) without affecting the result .",
    "if the black body emission is more beamed towards the spot normal because of a non - zero @xmath81 , this curve will be somewhat shifted down and left since @xmath209 then increases .",
    "for example , the black body variability amplitude observed in  is @xmath212 per cent ( gierliski et al .",
    "2002 ) and , correcting for @xmath81 , we can determine the region at the @xmath210 plane where it can be reproduced for a given @xmath111 .",
    "the situation is different when we consider a less beamed emission pattern @xmath213 with @xmath214 ( i.e. in our case radiation above @xmath215 kev ) .",
    "the oscillation amplitude is then strongly affected by the doppler effect ( compare dashed and solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : relateff]b ) .",
    "the maximum of the doppler factor and the spot projected area are shifted in phase by @xmath0 0.25 of the period and the peak of the emission is then shifted towards the phase where @xmath41 has the maximum",
    ". however , the amplitude and the shape of the profile carry the information needed to determine @xmath85 and the maximum doppler factor @xmath216 .",
    "again at the @xmath210 plane we can determine the curve of constant @xmath216 ( see dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : dopamrin]a ) .",
    "note , that since the doppler factor ( to the first order in @xmath217 ) depends on the product @xmath218 ( see eqs  [ [ eq : dop][eq : cosxi ] ] ) , but not on @xmath22 and @xmath19 individually , this curve is almost symmetric around the @xmath211 line .",
    "a very important point here is that the curves of constant @xmath209 and @xmath216 do not coincide ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dopamrin]a ) . at the @xmath210 plane",
    "thus there are at most two points ( for a given star mass @xmath31 and radius @xmath32 ) with the given values of these two parameters : points of the crossing of the curves of constant @xmath209 and @xmath216 .",
    "this leaves some ambiguity regarding the exchange of @xmath22 and @xmath19 .",
    "it is possible , however , that the number of crossing points is one or even zero which would then mean that there is no physical solution with a given doppler factor and the variability amplitude within the considered model .",
    "let us now apply our simple arguments to the data on .",
    "the observed light curve implies a maximum doppler factor about 1.015 and the variability amplitude @xmath209 for a black body spot given by equation  ( [ eq : ampl ] ) of @xmath219 ( actually observed higher value results from a sharper emission pattern with @xmath185 , see eq .",
    "[ [ eq : bb ] ] ) .",

    "the second solution is much less probable .",
    "first , we do not see any emission from the secondary antipodal spot .",
    "this implies that either it is blocked by the star itself ( which in turn requires the stellar radius to be @xmath221 for @xmath222 and @xmath223 ) , or it is blocked by the accretion disc . in the later case",
    "we have additional constraints . at inclinations smaller than @xmath224",
    "an upper limit on the inner disc radius ( i.e. the magnetospheric radius ) required to block the secondary spot is @xmath225 ( see lower dotted curve in fig .  [",
    "fig : dopamrin]a ) .",
    "with such a small inner radius , the expected amplitude of compton reflection component should be probably larger than the observed @xmath226 ( unless the inner disc is highly ionised ) and the shock should appear at uncomfortably large angle from the rotational pole if the magnetic field is a central dipole . on the other hand , at inclinations @xmath227 the antipodal spot is blocked by the disc if the magnetospheric radius is smaller than the corotation radius @xmath228 km which is also required for accretion to take place .",
    "second , small @xmath22 is inconsistent with the x - ray ( chakrabarty & morgan 1998 ) and optical ( giles , hill & greenhill 1999 ; homer et al .",

    "( 2001 ) based on the modelling of the optical / ir emission with the x - ray irradiated disc .",

    "there is no solution whatsoever .",
    "thus it is quite natural that the @xmath203 is worse for the high mass star ( see table  [ table : fit ] ) .",
    "this simple analysis also explains why the higher is the stellar mass , the higher the inclination should be in order to satisfy constraints on both @xmath209 and @xmath216 .      our results ( see table  [ table : fit ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : eos ] ) put constraints on mass of the compact object . for @xmath196",
    "the obtained stellar radius of @xmath181 km is too small to be consistent with any existing equations of state for neutron or strange stars .",

    "fig : all]c ) .",
    "we showed here that the black body and the comptonized components having different angular distribution generate light curves which are affected by the doppler effect in a different way .",
    "the doppler shift is an important ingredient but not the major cause of the soft lags . in our model ,",
    "the doppler effect comes into play only through its influence on the variability amplitude of the _ bolometric _ flux .",
    "on the other hand , ford ( 2000 ) and weinberg et al .",
    "( 2001 ) proposed a model where the lags in  are produced by the doppler effect alone through its influence on the _ monochromatic _ flux . in both papers a black body emission from the spot",
    "is assumed .",
    "when the spot is moving towards the observer , the doppler effect shift the spectrum towards higher energies , while motions away from the observer softens the spectrum and generate a deficit at high energies .",
    "thus , higher energy photons , in the tail of the black body distribution , arrive _ only _ at phases when motion is predominantly towards the observer , while the flux of photons at the peak of the black body distribution has a maximum together with the projected area , i.e. quarter of the period later .",
    "this results in hard leads ( or soft lags ) as well .",
    "as discussed in gierliski et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , there are a number of problems with this proposal .",
    "first , the photons in the black body tail contribute very little to the total observed spectrum above 8 kev which is dominated by the hard comptonized component .",
    "thus , any soft lags in the black body flux would be completely invisible in the total flux .",
    "second , a break in the phase lag energy dependence does not have any physical explanation in that model .    even stronger doppler boosting is expected when photons from the spot are scattered off a much more rapidly rotating inner disc ( sazonov & sunyaev 2001 ) .",
    "the scattered radiation will be leading or lagging the incident spot radiation depending on whether the disc is co - rotating or counter - rotating . for a black body radiation from the spot",
    ", this would translate into soft lags or leads , respectively .",
    "however , since the spectrum from the spot is closer to a power law , no phase lags should appear ( chen & shaham 1989 ) .",
    "a different angular distribution of the black body and comptonized components as well as a non - coherent nature of scattering can affect this result .",
    "it could be an interesting problem for future studies .",
    "we believe that this model is not directly related to , since the spot is probably situated close to the rotational pole and the fraction of the spot photons scattered in the disc is negligibly small .",

    "the softer photons ( scattered more times ) escape from the medium later producing soft lags . as the authors pointed out",
    ", the hard photons should escape to the observer directly through some kind of a hole in the cloud since otherwise a spectral cutoff should appear at @xmath275 kev ( e.g. sunyaev & titarchuk 1980 ; lightman , lamb & rybicki 1981 ) . this model , however , predicts a significantly reduced variability in the softer energy band ( chang & kylafis 1983 ; brainerd & lamb 1987 ) contrary to what is observed .",
    "the two main spectral components , black body and comptonized , are clearly identified in the time - averaged spectrum of .",
    "the pulse profiles show significant energy dependence and the softer photons lag the harder ones .",
    "such a behaviour can be reproduced if the hard comptonized emission peaks earlier than the black body emission ( gierliski et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the black body component shows about 25 per cent ( peak - to - peak ) variability amplitude and the doppler effect ( producing a @xmath0 7 per cent variability ) does not change its pulse profile much ( fig .",

    "the comptonized emission from an optically thin slab with a broader ( `` fan''like ) angular distribution has an intrinsically smaller variability amplitude .",

    "<S> the two main emission component , the black body and the comptonized tail that are clearly identified in the time - averaged spectrum , show strong variability with the first component lagging the second one . the observed variability can be explained if the emission is produced by comptonization in a hot slab ( radiative shock ) of thomson optical depth @xmath0 0.31 at the neutron star surface . </S>",
    "<S> the emission patterns of the black body and the comptonized radiation are different : a  knife\" and a  fan \" like , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we construct a detailed model of the x - ray production accounting for the doppler boosting , relativistic aberration and gravitational light bending in the schwarzschild spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> we present also accurate analytical formulae for computations of the light curves from rapidly rotating neutron stars using formalism recently developed by beloborodov ( 2002 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our model reproduces well the pulse profiles at different energies simultaneously , corresponding phase lags , as well as the time - averaged spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we constrain the compact star mass to be bounded between @xmath1 and @xmath2 . by fitting the observed profiles </S>",
    "<S> , we determine the radius of the compact object to be @xmath3 km if @xmath4 , while for @xmath5 the best - fitting radius is @xmath6 km , indicating that the compact object in can be a strange star . </S>",
