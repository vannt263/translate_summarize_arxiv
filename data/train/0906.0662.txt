    "the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism remains an open question in spite of the success of the standard model ( sm ) compared with the precision measurement data .",
    "the collisions of high energy photons produced at the linear collider provide a comprehensive laboratory for testing the sm and probing new physics beyond the sm @xcite . with the advent of the new collider technique ,",
    "the high energy and high intensity photon beams can be obtained by using compton laser photons scattering off the colliding electron and positron beams @xcite , and a large number of heavy quark pairs can be produced by this method .",
    "the photon energy spectrums show that there are many relatively soft photons , and the production of heavy top quark will be suppressed owing to the reduction of collision energies .",
    "however , no such suppression affects the relatively light bottom quark @xcite .",
    "therefore it is worth investigating the production of the bottom quark pairs in the photon - photon collisions .    in the sm ,",
    "this process has been calculated and the qcd threshold effects of the process have been also examined @xcite .",
    "reference @xcite presents a study of the yukawa corrections to this process in both the general two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) and the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , which arise from the virtual effects of the charged higgs and charged goldstone bosons , and shown that the relative correction to the total cross section of the processes @xmath6 is less than @xmath7 for the favorable parameter values . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors have calculated the yukawa correction to the cross section of @xmath8 induced by the pseudo - goldstone bosons and the new gauge bosons in the topcolor assisted technicolor ( tc2 ) model , and pointed out that the relative correction is negative and not more than @xmath9 . in this paper , we will study the contribution of the littlest higgs model with @xmath1 parity ( lht ) to this process .",
    "as we know , the fancy idea of little higgs @xcite tries to provide an elegant solution to the hierarchy problem by regarding the higgs boson as a pseudo - goldstone boson , whose mass is protected by an approximate global symmetry , and the quadratic divergence cancellation is due to the contributions from new particles with the same spin as the sm particles .",
    "the littlest higgs model @xcite is a cute economical implementation of the little higgs idea , but is found to be subject to the strong constraints from electroweak precision tests @xcite , which would require raising the mass scale of the new particles to far above tev scale and thus reintroduce the fine - tuning in the higgs potential @xcite . to tackle this problem , a discrete symmetry called @xmath1 parity is proposed @xcite , which forbids the tree - level contributions from the heavy gauge bosons to the observables involving only the sm particles as external states",
    ". therefore we will investigate the process @xmath10 in this model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present a brief review of the lht model .",

    "the goldstone bosons @xmath25 and @xmath22 are , respectively , eaten by the new t - odd gauge bosons @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , which obtain masses at the order of @xmath29 @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 being the sm @xmath33 and @xmath34 gauge couplings , respectively .",
    "the masses of the sm t - even @xmath35 boson and @xmath36 boson are generated through eating the goldstone bosons @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "they are given by @xmath39 the photon @xmath40 is also t - even and massless .    in order to cancel the quadratic divergence of the higgs mass coming from top loops , an additional t - even quark @xmath41 , as a heavy partner of top quark ,",

    "there are several free parameters in the lht model which are involved in the amplitude of @xmath8 .",

    "it has been found that a tev scale gim suppression is necessary for a generic choice of @xmath55 .",

    "the final numerical results are summarized in figs .",
    "[ fig : eps2]-[fig : eps4 ] .    figure [ fig : eps2 ] shows the total cross section @xmath139 versus @xmath3 with @xmath140 gev and @xmath141 , in which the dashed lines , dotted lines and dot - dashed lines denote the cases of @xmath142 , respectively , and the solid lines stand for the results of the tree level . from this figure , we can obtain the following results : ( i ) the cross section is strongly dependent on the parameter @xmath3 , and is about a few percent to dozens of percent larger than that of the tree level .",
    "it is natural since the couplings between the new top quark @xmath41 and the sm quarks are proportional to the mass of @xmath41 quark ; i.e. , are proportional to the breaking scale @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , our analytical calculations also show that the contributions from the heavy t - odd gauge bosons and goldstone bosons increase slightly with @xmath3 for @xmath143 , and decrease slowly when @xmath144 ; ( ii ) since the couplings between the mirror quarks and the sm quarks are proportional to the mirror quark masses , the cross section increases distinctly with @xmath3 for the cases of @xmath145 from @xmath146 , @xmath147 to @xmath148 gev , while the relative section cross is negative when all of @xmath3 and @xmath145 take small values ; and ( iii ) comparing these two scenarios , we can see that the cross section for scenario - ii does not have a large deviation from that for scenario - i when @xmath145 takes a small value , but the former is only about a half of the latter for a large value of @xmath145 .",

    "the cross section @xmath150 versus the parameter @xmath3 for various values @xmath4 when @xmath140 gev and @xmath151 is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : eps3 ] .",
    "we can see that : ( i ) the correction of the lht model to the cross section changes from negative to positive with @xmath3 becoming large ; ( ii ) the increment of the cross section with @xmath3 is slow for the cases of @xmath152 , @xmath153 and is quick for @xmath154 ; and ( iii ) the behavior of the cross section for scenario - ii is almost the same as that for scenario - i .     the total cross section @xmath139 versus @xmath3 with @xmath140 gev and @xmath151 .",
    "the dashed lines , dotted lines , dot - dashed lines and dot - dot - dashed lines indicate the cases of @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath155 , respectively , and the solid lines represent the results of the tree level . ]      in order to look at the relative correction of the lht model to the cross section , we take @xmath158 gev and @xmath141 as an example and plot @xmath159 as a function of @xmath145 in fig .  [ fig : eps4 ] . from this figure",
    ", we can find that ( i ) the contribution of the lht model to the process is very obvious unless @xmath145 is small , ( ii ) for the case of @xmath157 gev , the relative correction , @xmath159 , is sensitive to @xmath145 , and increases with @xmath145 from @xmath160 to @xmath161 for scenario - i and from @xmath160 to @xmath162 for scenario - ii , and ( iii ) for @xmath156 gev , the relative correction changes from @xmath163 for scenario - i , and @xmath164 for scenario - ii .",
    "we know that the ilc is the important next generation linear collider .",
    "according to the ilc reference design report @xcite , the ilc is determined to run with @xmath157 gev ( upgradeable to @xmath147 gev ) and the total luminosity required is @xmath166 with the first four year operation and @xmath167 during the first phase of operation with @xmath157 gev .",
    "it means that , millions of the bottom pairs per year can be produced , and the relative correction of the lht model to the cross section can reach the level from a few percent to dozens of percent when @xmath145 takes a larger value .",
    "however , the relative correction induced by the charged higgs and charged goldstone bosons in the 2hdm and mssm is less than @xmath7 @xcite , and in the tc2 model , the relative correction from the pseudo - goldstone bosons and the new gauge bosons is negative and no more than @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our calculations show that the contribution of higgs boson in the sm is only the order of @xmath168 which is negligibly small .",
    "therefore via the process @xmath169 , the lht model is experimentally distinguishable from the sm , 2hdm , mssm and tc2 models , which affords the possibility to test the lht model at the ilc unless @xmath170 and @xmath171 are very light .",
    "it is hoped that ilc will be able to give strong constraints on the relevant parameters of lht model since the correction of the lht model to the cross section of @xmath172 is sensitive to some parameters .    in conclusion , we have studied the contribution of the lht model to the process @xmath173 .",
    "we find that , for the favorable parameters , the total cross section @xmath174 is sensitive to the breaking scale @xmath3 , the mixing parameter @xmath4 , the masses of the mirror quarks @xmath5 , and the relative correction of the lht model is a few percent to dozens of percent unless @xmath145 is very small .",
    "the total cross section is significantly larger than the corresponding results in the standard model , the general two higgs doublet model , the minimal supersymmetric standard model , and the topcolor assisted technicolor model .",
    "therefore the difference is obvious for the international linear colliders and it is really interesting in testing the standard model and searching for the signs of the littlest higgs model with @xmath1 parity .",
