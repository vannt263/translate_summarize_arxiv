    "note , however , that the equation used to fit @xmath146 is obtained in the low - field limit while our data are in a 9.394  t field which is comparable to the thermal energy below 10 k.      spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath79 provides direct access to the low - energy spin excitations , as it probes the nearly zero - energy limit ( in the momentum space ) of the local spin - spin correlation function.@xcite therefore , spin - lattice relaxation time , @xmath177 is an important parameter which allows one to monitor the dynamics of a spin system in great detail .",
    "since there are two inequivalent @xmath7p sites in vp-@xmath4 , it would be interesting to probe the spin dynamics by measuring @xmath178 separately at the two @xmath7p sites .",

    "both @xmath179 and @xmath191 decrease rapidly towards zero owing to the spin gap in the excitation spectrum .",
    "generally , @xmath192 is expressed in terms of dynamical susceptibility @xmath193 as@xcite @xmath194 where the sum is over the wave vectors @xmath195 within the first brillouin zone , @xmath196 is the form factor of the hyperfine interactions as a function of @xmath195 , and @xmath197 is the imaginary part of the dynamic susceptibility at the nuclear larmor frequency @xmath198 . for @xmath199 and @xmath200 ,",

    "usually , at high temperatures ( i.e. in the paramagnetic regime ) where spins are uncorrelated , @xmath79 is dominated by the uniform @xmath199 fluctuations and @xmath79 remains temperature independent.@xcite in such a scenario , one would expect @xmath202  constant .",
    "surprisingly , in our compound @xmath179 shows a strong temperature dependency and @xmath203 is not constant , suggesting that the magnetic correlations ( @xmath204 ) persist upto high temperatures .",
    "this type of behaviour is typically observed in frustrated magnets .",
    "but @xmath191 is almost temperature independent at high temperatures and @xmath205  constant .",
    "as we have discussed earlier , p(1 ) is located asymmetrically between two v(2 ) sites and is strongly coupled to the local moment fluctuations while p(2 ) is located symmetrically between two v(2 ) sites and is weakly coupled .",
    "because of the symmetric location and weak hyperfine coupling , fluctuations from the neighbouring v(2 ) spins get nearly filtered out at the p(2 ) site which results in a nearly temperature independent @xmath191 behaviour at high temperatures . on the other hand , due to asymmetric location and strong hyperfine coupling , p(1 ) site experiences the persistent correlations at high temperatures giving raise to a temperature dependent @xmath179 behaviour .    in order to estimate the spin gap ,",
    "both @xmath179 and @xmath191 data in the low temperature region ( below @xmath206  k ) were fitted by the exponential function,@xcite @xmath207 in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , we plotted @xmath179 and @xmath191 @xmath23 @xmath149 where @xmath172-axis is shown in log scale so as to highlight the activated behaviour at low temperatures . from the exponential fit , the value of spin gap is estimated to be @xmath208  k and 14.6  k from @xmath209 and @xmath210 , respectively .",
    "these are consistent with the expected decrease due to the field , taking the low - field value from the @xmath80 analysis with the dimer model .    once again , for a gapped heigenberg 1d system , @xmath211.@xcite applying this to our @xmath191 data yields @xmath212  k while for the @xmath179 data we got @xmath213",

    "we have studied the crystal structure and detailed magnetic properties of the quantum magnet vp-@xmath4 .",
    "it shows neither any structural transition nor any change in symmetry down to 22.5  k. our experimental results basically confirm vp-@xmath4 as a new spin-@xmath8 weakly coupled dimer compound .",
    "the nearest - neighbour v@xmath14 ions are coupled antiferromagnetically to form dimers with a singlet ground state .",
    "the analysis of @xmath80 data with the dimer model establishes a spin gap of @xmath116  k between the singlet ground state and the triplet excited state at zero applied field and with a relatively weak inter - dimer coupling of @xmath214  k. the critical field corresponding to the gap closing is calculated to be about 19.6  t. on the other hand , fit of the susceptibility to the gapped 1d chain model gives @xmath123  k. the critical field required to close the gap in this case works out to about 15  t. temperature dependent esr intensity follows the same behaviour as @xmath80 .",
    "nmr reveals two crystallographically inequivalent p sites in the compound .",
    "the strong hyperfine coupling [ @xmath215  oe/@xmath16 ] for p(1 ) site and weak hyperfine coupling [ @xmath217  oe/@xmath16 ] for p(2 ) site are consistent with the crystal structure .",
    "the low temperature activated behaviour of nmr shift and @xmath178 unambiguously demonstrates singlet ground state in the compound .",
    "our estimated values of @xmath111 from the low - field @xmath80 data and @xmath79 analysis are close to what is expected at @xmath18  t , assuming a linear decrease with field from its zero - field value .",
