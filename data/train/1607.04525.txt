    "wireless communication , by its inherent broadcast nature , is vulnerable to eavesdropping by illegitimate receivers within communication range of the source .",
    "wyner in @xcite , for the first time , information - theoretically addressed the problem of secure communication in the presence of an eavesdropper and showed that secure communication is possible if the eavesdropper channel is a degraded version of the destination channel .",
    "the rate at which information can be transferred from the source to the intended destination while ensuring complete equivocation at the eavesdropper is termed as _ secrecy rate _ and its maximum over all input probability distributions is defined as the _ secrecy capacity _ of channel .",
    "later , @xcite extended wyner s result to gaussian channels .",
    "these results are further extended to various models such as multi - antenna systems @xcite , multiuser scenarios @xcite , fading channels @xcite .",
    "an interesting direction of work on secure communication in the presence of eavesdropper(s ) is one in which the source communicates with the destination via relay nodes @xcite .",
    "such work has considered various scenarios such as different relaying schemes ( _ amplify - and - forward _ and _ decode - and - forward _ ) , constraints on total or individual relay power consumption , one or more eavesdroppers . however , except for a few specific scenarios , such work does not provide tight characterization of secrecy capacity or even optimal secrecy rate achievable with the given relaying scheme .",
    "further , all previous work only considered secure communication scenarios where the source communicates with the legitimate destination(s ) in two hops , over so called _ diamond network _ @xcite .",
    "we consider a multihop unicast communication over _ layered _ network of relays in the presence of a single eavesdropper .",
    "the relays nodes are arranged in layers where all relays in a particular layer can communicate only with the relays in the next layer .",
    "the relay nodes , operating under individual power constraints , amplify - and - forward the signals received at their input . in this scenario , multiple relay nodes in each layer can cooperate to enhance the end - to - end achievable rate . also , the signals transmitted simultaneously by the relays add in the air , thus providing an opportunity for the relays in the second layer onward to perform analog network coding ( anc ) on the received _ noisy sum _ of these signals , where each relay merely amplifies and forwards this noisy sum @xcite .",
    "the eavesdropper can overhear the transmissions from the relay nodes of any of the layers depending on its location .",
    "the objective is to maximize the rate of secure transmission from the source to the destination by choosing the optimal set of scaling factors for the anc - relays , irrespective of the relays that the eavesdropper listens to .",
    "however , so far , there exists no closed - form expression or polynomial time algorithm to exactly characterize the optimal af secrecy rate even for general two - hop ( diamond ) relay networks , except for a few specific cases where eavesdropper s channel is a degraded or scaled version of destination channel @xcite and characterizing the optimal af secrecy rate for general layered network is an even harder problem than general diamond network .",
    "thus , to get some insights into the nature of the optimal solution for such networks , we consider symmetric layered networks , where all channel gains between the nodes in two adjacent layers are equal , thus the nomenclature of these networks as _ `` equal channel gains between adjacent layers ( ecgal ) '' _ networks @xcite .",
    "we provide closed - form solutions for the optimal secure af rate for such networks .",
    "we envision that these results may help us gain insight into the nature of the optimal solution and develop techniques which may further help in construction of low - complexity optimal schemes for general relay networks .",
    "the eavesdropper being a passive entity , a realistic eavesdropper scenario is the one where nothing about the eavesdropper s channel is known , neither its existence , nor its channel state information ( csi ) .",
    "however , the existing work on secrecy rate characterization assumes one of the following : ( 1 ) the transmitter has prefect knowledge of the eavesdropper channel states , ( 2 ) _ compound channel : _ the transmitter knows that the eavesdropper channel can take values from a finite set @xcite , and ( 3 ) _ fading channel : _ the transmitter only knows distribution of the eavesdropper channel @xcite . in this paper , we assume that the csi of the eavesdropper channel is known perfectly for the following two reasons .",
    "first , this provides an upper bound to the achievable secure anc rate for the scenarios where we have imperfect knowledge of the eavesdropper channel .",
    "for example , the lower ( upper ) bound on the compound channel problem can be computed by solving the perfect csi problem with the worst ( best ) channel gain from the corresponding finite set .",
    "further , this also provides a benchmark to evaluate the performance of achievability schemes in such imperfect knowledge scenarios .",
    "second , this assumption allows us to focus on the nature of the optimal solution and information flow , instead of on complexities arising out of imperfect channel models .",
    "the key contribution of this work is the computation of the globally optimal set of scaling factors for the nodes that maximizes the end - to - end secrecy rate for a class of layered networks .",
    "we also show that in the high - snr regime , anc achieves secrecy rates within an explicitly computed constant gap of the cutset upper bound on the secrecy capacity . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", this work offers the first characterization of the performance of secure anc in multi - layered networks in the presence of an eavesdropper .",
    "_ organization : _ in section  [ sec : sysmdl ] we introduce the system model and formulate the problem of maximum secure anc rate achievable in the proposed system model . in section  [ sec : optbeta ] we compute the optimal vector of scaling factors of the nodes of an ecgal network when eavesdropper snoops on the transmissions of the nodes in any one of the @xmath0 layers .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : highsnranalysis ] we analyze the high - snr behavior of the achievable secure anc rate and show that it lies within a constant gap from the corresponding cutset upper bound on the secrecy capacity and section  [ sec : numsim ] we numerically validate these results .",

    "although , for general layered networks it is very difficult to find which subset of relay nodes the eavesdropper chooses to snoop on so as to maximize its rate ; for symmetric networks it can be easily verified that the rate at the eavesdropper is maximized when it snoops on all the nodes of a layer .",
