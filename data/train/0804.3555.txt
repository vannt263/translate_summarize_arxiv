    "motion of particles in an external periodic potential with broken spatial symmetry and under influence of external forces with zero mean can result in occurrence of the persistent , directed current @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of the directed transport is a consequence of the violation of the detailed balance in systems acting away from equilibrium .",
    "typically , one assumes that the overall force acting on the particle is a superposition of the gaussian thermal noise with another periodic or stochastic force @xcite . in those cases",
    "all moments of the distribution of the noisy force do exist , and the existence of moments of the distribution of the particle s velocity is guaranteed .",
    "there are at least two reasons to consider the directed motion of a particle in a periodic ratchet potential under the influence of a heavy - tailed noise causing anomalously large particle displacements .",
    "one of them is pursuing the line of investigations of rectification of non - thermal noises and generalizing the corresponding considerations to the heavy - tailed cases which were found to be quite abundant under non - equilibrium conditions @xcite .",
    "another one , connected with the former , is seeking for the way to characterize the ensuing directed motion in the case when the corresponding statistical moments are absent , so that neither the dispersion nor even the mean of the corresponding displacements exist . in consequence , in such cases the standard characteristics of motion like mean velocity or peclet number become inapplicable .",
    "the interplay of deterministic dynamics and perturbative lvy - type noises have been addressed in literature in various scenarios including several noise - induced effects like resonant activation @xcite , stochastic resonance @xcite , dynamical hysteresis @xcite , studies of decay / relaxation properties of the probability densities @xcite , escape from bounded intervals @xcite , the classical barrier crossing problem @xcite or examination of stationary states @xcite .",
    "however , very few examples @xcite tackle the problem of lvy noise driven dynamics of periodic systems .    in the present work we study the behavior of a particle in the periodic potential with a broken spatial symmetry subjected to the action of a symmetric lvy stable noise .",
    "the @xmath0-stable noise can be expected to occur in systems being out of thermal equilibrium , where detailed balance conditions is violated . in such realms",
    "one can anticipate noise induced current in a static potential with broken spatial symmetry .",
    "consequently , what we address here as the lvy ratchet resembles so called thermal ratchet @xcite with time - dependent temperature variations .",
    "heavy tails of distribution of additive stochastic increments lead however to considerable peculiarities of such motion , due to power - law character of probability densities of the particle s displacements , which lack the dispersion and may also lack the mean .",
    "therefore , the examination of the current defined as the time derivative of the mean position may not be adequate for the lvy ratchet , and one has to look for other quantities which characterize the motion caused by the interplay of the noise and a potential . instead of examination of the current and of the effective diffusion coefficient we discuss several robust probabilistic characteristics of the particle s displacement based on its cumulative distribution : the behavior of median , which allows to introduce the group velocity , the growth of interquantile distances and the behavior of splitting probabilities ( as defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : split ] ) .",
    "as it will be discussed futher on , symmetric stable noise acting in a presence of a potential with broken spatial symmetry can induce directed motion of a test particle in an overdamped system .",
    "as long as the mean value of the perturbative noise exists and equals zero the displacement of the particle also possesses a mean",
    ". the overall motion can be then characterized by the temporal changes in the mean position , or , in the other words , by a mean velocity . in the case of an ensemble of particles",
    "mean velocity corresponds to the overall current , which is an adequate measure of the directionality of motion @xcite .",
    "this situation is realized for @xmath0-stable noises with @xmath1 .",
    "if the noise , however , is distributed according to a lvy - stable law with @xmath2 , neither the mean of the noise nor the mean of the overall displacement exist , so that one has to look for other quantities characterizing the directed motion .",
    "the discussion of these quantities , parallelly to investigation of the properties of the directed transport , is the main topic of the present article .",
    "its structure is as follows .",

    "<S> we consider the motion of an overdamped particle in a periodic potential lacking spatial symmetry under the influence of symmetric lvy noise , being a minimal setup for a `` lvy ratchet . '' </S>",
    "<S> due to the non - thermal character of the lvy noise , the particle exhibits a motion with a preferred direction even in the absence of whatever additional time - dependent forces . the examination of the lvy ratchet has to be based on the characteristics of directionality which are different from typically used measures like mean current and the dispersion of particles positions , since these get inappropriate when the moments of the noise diverge . to overcome this problem </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss robust measures of directionality of transport like the position of the median of the particles displacements distribution characterizing the group velocity , and the interquantile distance giving the measure of the distributions width . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we analyze the behavior of splitting probabilities for leaving an interval of a given length unveiling qualitative differences between the noises with lvy indices below and above unity . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we inspect the problem of the first escape from an interval of given length revealing independence of exit times on the structure of the potential . </S>"
