    "it is straightforward to show that the expectation value of the hamiltonian in the variational @xmath1 state is given in terms of @xmath69 by    @xmath70    where the last term arises from self - energies of the two static quarks ( @xmath71 is the @xmath16 color casimir in the fundamental representation ) .",

    "it is well established that confinement is related to the presence of magnetic domains in the vacuum , and these are absent in the variational vacuum state .",
    "one would expect that the magnetic term @xmath85 should play an important role in confinement since even the classical yang - mills field equations have monopole solutions  @xcite .    in the presence of qcd instantons ( _ a.k.a .",

    "for the hamiltonian of model-@xmath123 this implies that if the kinetic term ( proportional to @xmath193 ) was ignored , the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath194 for large-@xmath10 would behave as    @xmath195    at @xmath190 the quadratic term vanishes and the lowest chain state energy is expiated to grow linearly with @xmath10 . at large-@xmath10",
    "if @xmath196 then the lowest eigenvalue is dominated by the diagonal term . in this case the expectation value of @xmath115 , @xmath197 where @xmath198 is the wave function of the lowest energy chain state , can be determined by minimizing the diagonal part with respect to @xmath115 .",
    "this gives @xmath199 and the ground state energy approaches @xmath200 thus for @xmath201 the energy of the chain is higher than the energy of the bare state , @xmath54 . if @xmath202 the off - diagonal term dominates and the ground state energy becomes negative and proportional to @xmath203 while the average number of gluons in the chain @xmath204",
    "however , when the kinetic term is included in the critical case @xmath190 the lowest energy of the chain state no longer increases linearly with @xmath10 . after numerical diagonalization",
    "we find @xmath205 for a typical set of parameters @xmath206 , @xmath207 and @xmath208 , and we find weak dependence of the exponents on these parameters .",
    "that is , for the chain model-@xmath123 , we find that the lowest energy chain state has higher energy than the bare state . in the critical case the energy increases less rapidly than the length of the chain , @xmath10 , and is proportional to @xmath209 for @xmath201 .",

    "as @xmath10-increases at some point the energy of the ground state chain increases less than the coulomb potential .",
    "the chain state , however , has energy which is higher than that of the bare state , with the latter approaching a constant at large-@xmath10 .",
    "thus in both models interactions among the chain increase the energy of the @xmath127 pair as compared to the state with no gluons .",
    "we investigated microscopic origins of the gluon chain model . by analyzing the physical gauge interactions among constituent gluons , we fund a scenario for generating a chain . in this scenario",
    "a state with a number of gluons in the chain that is increasing with the separation between the @xmath127 source emerges from interactions of dynamical gluons with the background field .",
    "the background field is necessary in a phenomenological model of confinement if the latter is to originate from condensation of chromomagnetic charges .",
    "these interactions introduce off - diagonal elements into the effective hamiltonian , which is one of the main differences between this and the chain model where the pair - production is absent .",
    "we have shown that the resulting ground state energy is convex  @xcite but the two models considered are still too simplistic to generate the linearly rising potential .",
    "while this deficiency can potentially be improved by considering more sophisticated models for the background field we found it difficult to reproduce the zwanziger conjecture of `` no - confinement without coulomb confinement ''  @xcite .",
    "we find the energy of the chain state to be higher then that of the bare one , defined as the expectation value of the coulomb kernel in a state with no - backward reaction from the sources on the vacuum .",
