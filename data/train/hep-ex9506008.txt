    "using four triggers from run 1a and 1b , we combine dijet mass spectra above a mass of 150 gev / c@xmath1 , 241 gev / c@xmath1 , 292 gev / c@xmath1 , and 388 gev / c@xmath1 with integrated luminosities of    = 7.5 in    = 3.3 in = 3.3 in    .089 pb@xmath0 , 1.92 pb@xmath0 , 9.52 pb@xmath0 , and 69.8 pb@xmath0 respectively .",
    "jets are defined with a fixed cone clustering algorithm ( r=0.7 ) and then corrected for detector response , energy lost outside the cone , and underlying event .",

    "the @xmath18 cut provides uniform acceptance as a function of mass and reduces the qcd background which peaks at @xmath19 . in fig .",
    "[ fig_dijet ] the dijet mass distribution is presented as a differential cross section in bins of the mass resolution ( @xmath20% ) . at high mass",
    "the data is systematically higher than a prediction from pythia plus a cdf detector simulation , similar to the inclusive jet @xmath21 spectrum  @xcite . to search for new particles we determine the qcd background by fitting the data to a smooth function of three parameters  @xcite ; fig .",
    "[ fig_dijet ] shows the fractional difference between the data and the fit ( @xmath22 ) .",

    "it is sufficient to determine the mass resolution for only one type of new particle because the detector resolution dominates the width . in fig .",
    "[ fig_resonance ] we show the mass resolution for excited quarks ( q * ) from pythia plus a cdf detector simulation ; the long tail at low mass comes from gluon radiation . for each value of new particle mass in 50 gev / c@xmath1 steps ,",

    "the large mass of the top quark suggests that the third generation may be special .",
    "topcolor  @xcite assumes that the top mass is large mainly because of a dynamical @xmath5 condensate generated by a new strong dynamics coupling to the third generation . here",
    "the @xmath41 of qcd is a low energy symmetry arising from the breaking of an @xmath42 coupling to the third generation and an @xmath43 coupling to the first two generations only .",

    "we start with the dijet search in 19 pb@xmath0 of run 1a data  @xcite and additionally require at least one of the two leading jets be tagged as a bottom quark .",

    "[ fig_btag ] , and the fluctuation is only a @xmath56 effect , so we proceed to set limits on new particle production .",
