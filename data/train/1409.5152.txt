    "superclusters are usually defined as `` clusters of clusters '' given that mainly catalogues of galaxy clusters have been used to identify them .",
    "@xcite was the first to present evidence of the existence of a large - scale superstructure now known as the local supercluster .",
    "the superclustering as a general phenomenon was originally advocated by various authors , beginning with @xcite , and followed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . taking this definition of superclusters as aggregates of two or more galaxy clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , supercluster catalogues have been produced using the pseudo-3d distribution of abell / aco clusters @xcite by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , among others .",
    "@xcite were the first to use the total sample of abell / aco a - clusters to construct an all - sky catalogue of 69 superclusters within a redshift of @xmath5 , with an overdensity of at least twice the average density , and with at least three member clusters .",
    "@xcite used 1663 a - clusters ( 64% of them with measured spectroscopic redshifts ) , out to @xmath6 , to obtain a catalogue of 285 superclusters via a percolation analysis based on a linking length of 34@xmath7 mpc , assumed constant throughout the considered volume .",
    "the number of member clusters ( commonly called multiplicity , @xmath8 ) ranged from 2 to 35 . in addition",
    ", they also presented the first catalogue of 19 superclusters based on x - ray luminous clusters detected in the rosat all - sky survey @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite published a catalogue of 195 superclusters based on the rosat - eso flux limited x - ray galaxy cluster survey ( reflexii ) .",
    "some authors have also used catalogues of individual galaxies based on large - scale surveys to search for superclusters , defining these as significant density enhancement of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    generally superclusters , being immerse in the `` cosmic web '' , exhibit irregular or filamentary shapes connected through bridges of galaxies and separated by extensive `` void '' regions where almost no galaxies are found .",
    "properties of the large - scale structure ( determined using both observational data and n - body cosmological simulations ) have been discussed , e.g.  by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "currently there is no evidence that superclusters have reached virialization , since the sizes of these structures range from a few mpc to @xmath9150@xmath7 mpc , and the crossing time for a member cluster within the system exceeds the age of the universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this implies that these systems still preserve a memory of their dynamical history , which makes them worth studying .",
    "furthermore , since they constitute the environment of a considerable fraction of the clusters , groups and galaxies themselves , by comparing their properties with those in lower - density environments we can study the effect of this environment on the evolution of such systems .",
    "galaxy clusters are the most massive systems in the universe that have condensed out of the hubble flow , and their evolution is still a matter of vital discussion .",
    "finally , superclusters represent regions of significant density enhancement which cause distortions in the local gravitational field that are sometimes noticeable via the bulk motions towards them ( e.g. the case of the great attractor , * ? ? ?",
    "they also provide information on the mass distribution in intercluster space , e.g.  by measuring their imprint on the cmb via the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "all these features allow one to constrain and refine cosmological models of the universe .    in the present work we describe two new catalogues of superclusters based on the update of late 2012 of the abell / aco cluster redshift compilation by one of us ( for a description of its content cf .",
    "* ) , restricting ourselves to clusters with redshift @xmath10 .",
    "for the first catalogue we consider the distribution of abell / aco a - clusters ( rich clusters ) all over the sky , while the second one is a southern sky catalogue ( @xmath1 ) based on both a - clusters and the supplementary s - clusters ( typically poorer than the a - clusters ) . for the construction of both catalogues we tuned the linking length as a function of redshift and position on the sky , thus allowing for both undersampling at higher redshifts and deeper redshift observations over certain areas of the sky , like those covered by the sloan digital sky survey @xcite .",
    "the effect of the inclusion of the s - clusters in the large - scale structure is studied by comparing the two catalogues .",
    "we also discuss the cumulative distribution of multiplicities ( number of member clusters ) for the superclusters in the local universe , based on both observational and simulated data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : data ] we describe our abell / aco cluster sample ; in section [ sec : analysis ] we discuss and explain the percolation analysis we applied ; section [ sec : sc ] explains the generated catalogues and compares them with that of @xcite ; in section [ sec : prop_sc ] we present some properties of the large - scale structure by intercomparing our catalogues , and by comparing their multiplicity functions with the ones obtained for different supercluster samples , including supercluster catalogues generated from distributions of equivalent dark matter haloes in cosmological simulations .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] presents our conclusions and summary .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume the following cosmological parameters : @xmath11 km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "the abell / aco cluster redshift compilation used here ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is a collection of individual radial velocities for potential member galaxies of such clusters .",
    "the compilation has been updated since 1989 @xcite by monitoring redshift data of galaxies from the published literature and a few unpublished references . the compilation , as of late 2012 , contains redshifts for about 130,000 individual cluster galaxies in 3930 different abell clusters .",
    "whenever a cluster shows more than one concentration along the line of sight , separated in redshift by more than @xmath91500kms@xmath12 , we register these as components a , b , c , ... in increasing order of redshift . in many cases , the component with the dominant number of redshifts is clearly the one recognized by abell / aco , while in other cases these components may be similarly populated , and the identification is not straightforward . in what follows , we shall refer to these as _ line - of - sight components _ of a cluster , and we include all the detected ones in our analysis out to @xmath15 .    with the advent of large - scale multi - object spectroscopic surveys , like the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the six - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 6dfgrs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the sloan digital sky survey ( e.g. sdss - dr7 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the source of redshifts for this compilation has gradually changed from surveys of individual clusters to large - area redshifts surveys , resulting in more redshifts for cluster members from fewer references per year .",
    "we include a number of new spectroscopic redshifts obtained by us for galaxies in 121 clusters .",
    "these will be published in a separate paper .",
    "furthermore , for clusters with no spectroscopic redshift as yet , the compilation also includes estimated redshifts , kindly provided by m.  west ( 2007 , private communication ) and based on the relation proposed by @xcite .",
    "the current compilation includes all 4076 a- and 1174 s - clusters . for 1011 of the a - clusters we list a total of 2511 line - of - sight components , resulting in altogether 5576 clusters / components , while 230 s - clusters are split into 551 components , resulting in a total of 1495 s - clusters / components . from these we selected the ones with redshift below 0.15 as the basis for our search for superclusters .",
    "these were 3410 a - clusters / components ( 92% of them having measured spectroscopic redshifts for at least one member , and 76% for at least three galaxies ) , and 1168 s - clusters / components ( 91% with at least one galaxy with measured spectroscopic redshift , and 69% with at least three ) . beyond this redshift",
    "the sample becomes noticeably more incomplete .",
    "the redshift distribution for both samples is shown in figure  [ figure : sel ] .",
    "the s - clusters represent an important contribution in the southern sky , and they complement the sample toward lower richness clusters in this region at lower redshifts .    in figure",
    "[ figure : zdis ] we divided the entire sample in subsamples according to their position on the sky , in order to identify systematic effects in their global distribution . in the northern sample",
    "the main effect is the presence of the sdss redshift data : where these data exist the clusters are more completely spectroscopically sampled such that more clusters enter in the sample at relatively high redshifts ( @xmath16 ) . on the other hand , the s - clusters affect the southern sample especially at lower redshifts ( @xmath17 ) such that the first peak in redshift in the second panel of both figs .  [",
    "figure : sel ] and [ figure : zdis ] is dominated by them . in the redshift range considered here ,",
    "the s - clusters are almost exclusively poorer systems than the a - clusters .",
    "thus , we decided to divide our sample into four , rather than two , subsamples , namely two northern subsamples , one for the sdss region and another for the rest of the northern sky , and another two southern subsamples ( @xmath18 ) , one including both a- and s - clusters and the other only the a - clusters .     using a constant space density of clusters corresponding to the most completely surveyed redshifts for each distribution , namely @xmath19 for the all - sky distribution of a - clusters , and @xmath20 for the a+s clusters in the southern ( @xmath18 ) sample .",
    "these values are : 7.4@xmath21 @xmath22 mpc@xmath23 for only the a - clusters and 2.8@xmath24 @xmath22 mpc@xmath23 for a- and s - clusters together in the south .",
    "the first value is comparable to the one found by @xcite ( 8.9@xmath21 @xmath22 mpc@xmath23 ) for abell / aco clusters .",
    "the dashed line in the right panel indicates the same function as the solid line in the left panel .",
    "these curves grow according to @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the comoving distance as described by @xcite . , width=302 ]",
    "the friends - of - friends algorithm ( fof , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is frequently used to link points when we do not know _ a priori _ how they are distributed . in a virialized regime ,",
    "such as we expect for at least the cores of the galaxy clusters , the linking length is determined by assuming a spherical gravitational collapse model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however , since the superclusters are probably not in an equilibrium state , we can not derive the ideal linking length in this way .    in the percolation analysis ,",
    "the method usually used for identifying superclusters of galaxies , the linking length of the fof is chosen such that it maximizes the number of systems formed .",
    "the result of the percolation analysis depends strongly on the linking length ( @xmath27 ) . for smaller linking lengths",
    "the fof yields a smaller number of only the densest systems , while for larger linking lengths these systems start to connect among themselves , lowering the total number of systems until a complete percolation of the sample is reached ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for this reason , in the identification of superclusters of galaxies , the linking length of the fof is often chosen such that it maximizes the number of systems formed in the percolation process .",
    "we shall call this the _ critical linking length _ , @xmath28 .",
    "the percolation analysis relies on the fact that the mean density is correctly represented ( i.e.  the completeness of the sample ) in the considered volume . in an ideal ( complete and homogeneous ) sample ,",
    "the critical linking length obtained this way should be the same throughout the entire volume . since the distribution of the clusters in our sample is clearly less complete at higher redshifts ( see figures  [ figure : sel ] and [ figure : zdis ] ) , and also differs from one subsample to the other",
    ", the choice of a single critical linking length for a supercluster search based on abell / aco clusters is certainly not the best solution .",
    "therefore , we used a _",
    "tunable _ value of @xmath28 , which is allowed to vary with the selection function and thus corrects for completeness variations in both redshift and position on the sky . this selection function (",
    "the fraction of clusters missed as a function of the redshift , due to an inhomogeneous sampling and the malmquist bias ) is measured directly by estimating the value of @xmath28 in the four different subsamples and in different redshift ranges .    to this end",
    "we divided each subsample into seven spherical shells with a width of @xmath29 , ( allowing an overlap between them of @xmath30 ) , inside which the density is not expected to vary significantly .",
    "thus , the first bin ranges from @xmath31 to @xmath32 , the second one from @xmath33 to @xmath34 , and so on .",
    "we obtained the value of @xmath28 for each redshift `` shell '' and constructed the so - called `` percolation function '' ( pf ) , i.e.  the value of @xmath28 as function of the redshift .",
    "percolation functions for each subsample are shown in figure  [ figure : per ] .",
    "three different pf were chosen .",
    "the first of these is the combination of the northern sample ( excluding the sdss region ) and the southern sample ( excluding the s - clusters ) , which we call the _ master  pf_. as expected , these two subsamples show a similar behavior .",
    "the second pf is that for the sdss region , which we call the _",
    "sdss  pf_. since it is poorly sampled at lower redshifts ( @xmath35 ) , we first freely fitted the data and , then , forced it to coincide with the master  pf at @xmath36 , taking the master  pf as the sdss  pf for redshifts lower than this .",
    "the third pf is that for the southern subsample including the s - clusters , which we call the _",
    "southern  pf_. this latter one presents smaller critical linking lengths , @xmath28 than the master  pf at every redshift , and especially so at the lowest redshifts , obviously due to the higher space density of clusters when s - clusters are included .",
    "the redshift range in which the pfs reach their lowest value may be interpreted as the one of highest completeness , and _ vice - versa _ : in an undersampled region , the value of @xmath28 is larger .",
    "thus , employing these pfs in our fof compensates for the loss of objects due to selection effects .",
    "according to these curves , the best sampled region ( excluding the contribution of sdss and s - clusters ) is near @xmath37 , where the master  pf reaches its minimum . at lower redshifts",
    "the sample suffers a deficiency due to the exclusion of clusters at @xmath38 , as imposed by the authors of the abell / aco catalogues . at higher redshifts",
    "the undersampling is due to limiting sensitivity of the sky surveys used to find the clusters and incompleteness in the spectroscopic sampling .",
    "the sdss  pf has smaller values than the master  pf at higher redshifts due to the more complete sampling of the sdss . as a consequence of the inclusion of the s - clusters ,",
    "the southern  pf is always smaller than the master  pf , especially at lower redshifts . near the minimum of the master  pf ( i.e.  where the sampling is best , near @xmath36 ) we find @xmath39 mpc while for lower redshifts the southern  pf reaches a minimum that corresponds to a @xmath40 mpc .

    "the master and sdss pfs were used to produce the _ main supercluster catalogue _ ( mscc ) based on the all - sky sample of a - clusters .",

    "supercluster candidates _ the ones which would not be found by our fof in a test catalogue that excludes the clusters with estimated redshifts . in our abell / aco sample limited to @xmath44 , out of 4578 clusters ( including a- and s - clusters as well as their line - of - sight components ) there are 358 with only estimated redshifts , identified with an `` e '' following their names in tables  [ table : mscc ] and [ table : sscc ] . using the above definition , 37 ( 6% ) of the mscc and 38 ( 9% ) of the sscc superclusters are candidates , identified in the catalogues with a letter `` c '' following the supercluster sequence number .",

    "what would one expect from a completely random sample of particles ?",
    "figure  [ figure : mf]g is the average of the mf of one thousand simulated catalogues based on randonly distributed points that represent abell / aco clusters .",
    "these distributions were produced assigning random coordinates to each point .",
    "each distribution contains 7329 points in a spherical volume of `` radius '' @xmath15 .",
    "this condition simulates the mean density of the best - sampled region of mscc . in each sample",
    ", the value of the critical linking length , @xmath28 , was found , and a fof algorithm was applied .",
    "we produced one thousand mock supercluster catalogues , from which the number of frequency of each richness was averaged ( note that this resulted in high - richness systems having fractional values of frequency in figure  [ figure : mf]g ) .",
    "again , as for the other distributions , the slope @xmath46 is shown , but neither the cosmological simulations nor the random distribution reproduces the shape of the cumulative multiplicity function of the observational samples . actually , the completely random sample appears more similar to the distribution based on the millennium data .",
    "the hump in the curves based on mock catalogues , much stronger in the random and millennium mf , can be interpreted as a lower probability to obtain high - richness superclusters from such samples .",
    "we can see this in the random distribution , where the structures are in a poissonian regime and the value of the power spectrum is expected to be zero .",
    "however , in a gravitational regime one may expect to obtain structures ( power spectrum @xmath470 ) , that drive the superclusters toward the richest systems , which would explain why in the mf of cluster - based catalogues the curves do not decay ( at the rich end ) as abruptly as in the random case .",
    "power laws have also been fitted in the literature for the number of galaxies within groups of sdss by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite found values for @xmath46 of @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 for different volume - limited samples of absolute magnitude limits of @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite found @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 for these luminosity ranges , and @xmath57 for @xmath58 . since these distributions are based on `` particles '' ( galaxies ) of much lower mass we do not expect a direct relation with those obtained here , except , as we said , that the power law will be a natural distribution for systems in gravitational regimes",
    "we summarize our conclusions as follows .    * we constructed two new supercluster catalogues based on the optically - selected abell / aco clusters , which not only reach deeper in space ( @xmath10 ) than previous ones , but also contain a much higher fraction ( @xmath5985% ) of clusters with spectroscopically confirmed redshifts .",
    "different from previous works , we include in our analysis the different line - of - sight components for the clusters ( up to the above - mentioned redshift limit ) .",
    "one of these catalogues is the all - sky main supercluster catalogue ( mscc ) , based on only the rich abell a - clusters , the other is the southern supercluster catalogue ( sscc ) covering declinations @xmath1 and including the supplementary abell s - clusters . * a tunable linking length was used to generate these supercluster catalogues , taking into account the undersampling at higher redshift and the different selection functions in different regions of the sky .",
    "the area covered by sdss is clearly better sampled than the rest of the sky , and a special percolation function was fitted for this region . also , for the southern sky , the inclusion of the s - clusters required an independent correction for the selection function .",
    "we conclude that the `` percolation function '' is an efficient tool for detecting and correcting the selection function for samples of galaxy clusters .",
    "* for the all - sky main sample of a - clusters we found that the maximum completeness is reached near @xmath60 , which leads to a critical linking length of @xmath61 mpc , while for the south ( @xmath1 ) the s - clusters provide the best sampling at @xmath62 , leading to @xmath63 mpc .",
    "* the mscc and the sscc contain 601 and 423 superclusters , respectively .",
    "considering the probability for a cluster to be member of a supercluster or not , we found the following : 35% of the clusters tend to be isolated , 18% form pairs and 47% are hosted by a supercluster with @xmath64 . of",
    "the superclusters found , the fraction of pairs ( @xmath65 ) is @xmath66% , while the fraction of very rich superclusters ( @xmath67 ) is @xmath68% of the systems .",
    "the complete catalogues and input lists of clusters are available in the electronic version of this paper .",
    "* by comparing our mscc directly with the one by @xcite we find : ( 1 ) a slightly higher fraction of isolated clusters ( 35% compared to 30% in scl ) ; ( 2 ) 37 new superclusters identified in the same volume investigated previously ; ( 3 ) 126 new superclusters near and beyond @xmath6 ; ( 4 ) 70% of einasto et al.s candidate superclusters were not confirmed as such .",
    "the fraction of candidate superclusters was reduced from 40% to 6% , thanks to the much higher fraction of clusters with spectroscopically confirmed redshifts in our sample .",
    "* comparison between the mscc and sscc reveals that the s - clusters seem to prefer to inhabit the surroundings of richest clusters .",
    "the lower critical linking length in sscc only breaks up the mscc systems with @xmath69 and , since these systems represent only @xmath92.0% of the mscc , and only 1.2% of them are in the declination range of sscc , this fragmentations is not significant .",
    "more important effects of the inclusion of s - clusters on the distribution are new superclusters ( with multiplicities @xmath70 ) of only s - clusters and the `` nucleation '' of a - clusters surrounded by s - clusters . * the distributions of supercluster `` richness '' ( the multiplicity function ) of the mscc and sscc",
    "follow a power law of slope @xmath45 .",
    "a very similar behaviour is seen in other catalogues based on observational data , namely the scl @xcite and a catalogue generated from 2mass groups @xcite , the latter being far more complete for lower - mass systems .",
    "however , when similar supercluster catalogs are generated from mock data , namely using the millennium @xcite and the bolshoi @xcite n - body cosmological simulations , the multiplicity functions change from a power law to a convex curve , predicting less superclusters in both the low- and high - multiplicity regimes . a similar behaviour , even farther from a power law , is found for an entirely random distribution of input clusters .",
