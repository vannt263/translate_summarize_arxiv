    "a binary pulsar ( psr ) consists of a spinning neutron star ( ns ) with a radio beam , and a companion , in a mutual orbit .",
    "the companion is usually another compact object  either another ns or a white dwarf ( wd ) .",
    "a typical ns is a highly relativistic object . with mass @xmath0 and radius @xmath1 km ,",
    "the ns has @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , the psr s radio pulses serve as a highly precise spin - powered clock , enabling the accurate measurement of the spin and orbital parameters of the binary system and the testing of relativistic gravitational effects in strong - field conditions . for example , the double ns system psr b1913 + 16 has provided the first evidence for the existence of gravitational waves,@xcite while ns - wd systems tend to be the best binary psrs for probing violations of lorentz invariance .",
    "the weak - field , parametrized post - newtonian ( ppn ) framework was extended in ref .   to include the possibility of preferred - frame effects ( pfe ) , via parameters @xmath3 .",
    "this analysis was further augmented to encompass the strong fields of binary psrs,@xcite as follows .    a gravitational @xmath4-body post - newtonian lagrangian was derived with terms for @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where the ` hat ' over a parameter indicates that it is a strong - field modification of the ppn version ; commensurate with the highly relativistic environment of a binary psr system .",
    "the @xmath5-part of the lagrangian includes a dependence of the vector velocity @xmath7 of the binary center of mass with respect to the preferred frame , leading to some potentially measurable effects . for small - eccentricity binary psrs , the eccentricity vector @xmath8 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) undergoes the following time evolution : @xmath9 where the first term results from the usual general relativistic advance of periastron whose mean rate is @xmath10 ; but the second is a nonzero constant ` polarizing' term resulting from pfe , and proportional to @xmath11 ( a function of orbital parameters and component masses ) , @xmath5 and @xmath12 ( the projection of @xmath7 onto the orbital plane ) : @xmath13 ( which points in the orbital plane , perpendicular to @xmath14 ) . hence the measurement of eccentricity over time affords the possibility of separating the two terms in eq .   and then , for a given choice of preferred frame of @xmath15 ( e.g. , the cosmic microwave background ) , determining the desired pfe parameter @xmath5 from eq .",
    "[ aba : fixedecc ] .    however , some observational difficulties remain .",
    "first , the velocity of the binary system s center of mass with respect to earth is difficult to measure , which limits the accuracy of @xmath15 ( both its direction and magnitude ) .",
    "also the angle @xmath16 is not measurable from psr timing , thereby further limiting the accuracy of its projection @xmath12 . in general , statistical arguments",
    "must be employed in order to ameliorate these limitations , although much progress has also been made in overcoming them observationally .",
    "( see below . )",
    "the measured eccentricity for the ns - wd psr b1855 + 09 system was then combined with the above analysis to provide an upper limit on @xmath17 of @xmath18 , which was comparable to contemporaneous solar system limits , and ( unlike the solar system case ) measured in _",
    "strong _ gravitational fields .    building upon the work of ref .  , it was shown@xcite that _ both _",
    "@xmath5 _ and _ @xmath6 are determinable from timing measurements of low - eccentricity binary psrs , and the new analysis was applied to two additional ns - wd binary psr systems : psr j1012 + 5307 and psr j1738 + 0333 , as follows .",
    "a nonzero @xmath6 will cause precession of the orbital pole , @xmath19 , about @xmath15 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "this precession leads to an observable consequence in the psr timing measurable @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath21 is the semimajor axis of the psr orbit , and @xmath22 is the ` inclination ' angle between @xmath19 and @xmath23 : @xmath24 where angles @xmath25 and @xmath26 specify the instantaneous direction of @xmath27 in the ( precessing ) @xmath28 coordinate system , as shown in fig .  1 . however , there are observational difficulties in determining @xmath29 and the angles , similar to those discussed above in the determination of @xmath5 .",
    "while significant progress has been made , the nature of psr timing observations prevents the determination of @xmath16 and hence accurate values of @xmath30 , and @xmath25 , so it remains necessary to use statistical arguments to extract the pfe parameter @xmath31 a joint analysis from both pulsars leads to @xmath32 .",
    "this limit is far weaker than the solar system limit of ref .  , but does have the benefit of probing strong fields .",
    "the analysis of @xmath33 of ref .   was also revisited . with the benefit of additional kinds of observational data that leave only @xmath16 undetermined , an upper limit on @xmath34 of @xmath35 )",
    "\\times 10^{-5}$ ] was found for psr j1738 + 0333 , making it the best extant constraint for this parameter .",
    "the determination of ppn parameter @xmath36 from binary psrs was derived theoretically in ref .  ; ref .",
    "reports an exquisitely precise null measurement , as expected in semiconservative theories of gravitation .",
    "the first extensive theoretical sme analysis of the signal of lorentz violation in binary psrs was published in ref .  .",
    "in developing the general theory , twenty independent lorentz - violating coefficients were found , including nine in the field @xmath37 .",
    "it was shown that three of the ppn parameters are expressible in terms of the single coefficient @xmath38 ; and that @xmath39 , indicating that ( at least in the weak - field limit ) , they are not independent .",
    "more importantly , it was shown that binary psr secular _",
    "measurables _ @xmath40 and @xmath41 can be expressed in terms of combinations of projections of the sme @xmath37 along the orbital axes @xmath28 , raising the prospect of determining these sme lorentz - violating coefficients via binary psr timing observations .",
    "therefore wholly new tests of lorentz violation become available which are not accessible in the ppn formulation .",
    "observationally , the most promising direction involves the detection and measurement of additional binary psr systems . these would increase the parameter - space coverage of current tests , which could lead for example to disentangling the currently covariant sme lorentz - violation coefficients@xcite , and increasing the sky coverage of lorentz - violation tests.@xcite planned new , highly sensitive radiotelescopes will detect numerous such systems@xcite .",
    "theoretically , the most exciting prospect includes the generation of additional sme measurables in binary psr systems .",
