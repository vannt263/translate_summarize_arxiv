    "the physical properties of molecular clouds the birthplace of stars are of vital importance , since they reveal clues as to why stars are formed in certain regions , how many stars can form , how star formation proceeds and how it affects the next cycle of stellar production ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "therefore , the method we use to determine these cloud properties is a critical choice .",
    "traditionally , the best quality data of molecular clouds has come from our own galaxy , where the small distances involved allow galactic molecular clouds with sizes down to @xmath0 10 pc to be resolved even with single dish telescopes .",
    "these observations have offered the chance to study molecular clouds in some detail , with previous studies revealing our galactic molecular cloud population has a mass , size and velocity dispersion of 10@xmath1 m@xmath2 , 5  70 pc , and 2  10 km s@xmath3 , respectively ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "despite the quality of this data , it provides information only on one type of galaxy , and the milky way is relatively quiescent .",
    "studies of external galaxies are therefore required before we can reveal the whole picture of the relation between molecular clouds and star formation .    of course",
    ", the drawback of extragalactic studies is the large distances that limit the resolution .",
    "however , observations of molecular clouds in these galaxies are now approaching the quality of that in the milky way , thanks to instruments and techniques such as the long - baseline interferometry employed with alma .",
    "alma is designed to detect spectral lines such as carbon monoxide ( co ) which traces molecular clouds in a normal galaxy like the milky way at a redshift @xmath4 in less than 24 hours .",
    "this rate means that the time required to map molecular clouds in a nearby galaxy will shrink to only a few hours . with the highest expected angular resolution of low transition co lines being about 0.04@xmath5 ,",
    "a galaxy @xmath6 16 mpc away in the virgo cluster can be mapped with a physical resolution of @xmath64pc .",
    "the highest velocity resolution of low transition co lines at 0.01 km s@xmath3 , so assuming the molecular clouds in nearby galaxies have comparable properties to those in the milky way , these resolutions should be sufficient to resolve these populations .",
    "note that this assumption seems to be valid based on the current surveys of extragalactic clouds such as paws @xcite and canon @xcite .",
    "these observations suggest that extragalactic and galactic molecular clouds share similar larson s scaling relation of cloud properties .    with the spatial and velocity resolution of observations",
    "about to resolve a wide population of molecular clouds , comparisons between observations and simulations become a key tool in understanding the results .",
    "however , this can be challenging since the two techniques are based on different data structures",
    ". simulations normally have data with three dimensional position ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) and velocity ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) coordinates , from which they directly calculate the physical properties of the molecular clouds such as mass , radius and volume density",
    ". meanwhile observations have to take their data from the projected image on the sky .",
    "this provides only two spatial dimensions ( ra and dec ) and typically a single velocity along the line - of - sight .",
    "the resultant properties of the clouds are therefore computed in three independent dimensions , rather than six .",
    "an additional issue is the choice for the molecular cloud boundary .",
    "clouds are typically selected based on their density ( in the case of simulations ) or intensity ( from observations ) . yet",
    "molecular clouds are not isolated entities and therefore exactly where their edges lie is not obvious .",
    "simulators navigate this issue by selecting a fixed threshold for the cloud edge , while observers consider the ratio of the intensity to the rms noise . even within a single technique ,",
    "there is no consensus for what such thresholds should be .",
    "the problem is magnified when the molecular region is extended .",
    "should a continuous contour mark a single cloud or should this be divided into separate peaks ?    a major reason for this degeneracy is the absence of a ` correct ' answer .",
    "molecular clouds are part of the interstellar medium ( ism ) ; a continuous blend of pressures and densities ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "there is therefore no obvious edge to the clouds , which are typically thought to be borderline gravitationally bound at best @xcite .",
    "likewise , it is not clear which properties should be used to identify the cloud .",
    "simulators typically only use position , taking advantage of their three spatial dimensions . yet",
    ", this excludes the velocity information which could identify two sections of an object moving together .",
    "conversely , observers are plagued by projection effects which can result in well separated bodies being treated as a single object or regions of the same cloud being artifically split due to the internal motions of the cloud .",
    "the combined result of different data structures and varying choices for cloud identification means that conclusions are being drawn about the star formation conditions in galaxies from results that are not considering the same objects .",
    "previous work has tried to assess the extent on this problem on smaller scales , comparing star - forming regions found in synthetic observations of a single simulated molecular cloud with those identified using the full position data . @xcite",
    "first noticed that the synthetic observed gmcs in their 3d simulations include spatially - unconnected structures due to the projection effect .",
    "when examining dense clumps found in two- and three- dimensional position data , recently @xcite found that projection effects could overestimate the mass of the clumps within the cloud and falsely identify more diffuse regions as clumps .",
    "the result was a shift by a factor of three in the clump mass function ( cmf ) , potentially explaining the difference between the observed cmf and the lower stellar initial mass function ( imf ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite did note that the addition of the velocity in their two dimensional data improved the match with the three dimensional clump properties compared to when the two dimensional data was used alone .",
    "@xcite further considered the differences in the observed chemistry and gravity of the clump properties by matching clumps in the synthetic observations and three dimensional spatial data if they originate from the same density structure .",
    "they concluded that the scatter in the clump properties causes significant uncertainty in the virial parameter ( estimating gravitational boundness ) of a cloud such that it is difficult to connect this with star formation .",
    "in this paper , we present a comparison of the physical properties of the molecular clouds identified in three spatial co - ordinates ( position - position - position space or ppp ) and those in two projected spatial co - ordinates and a single line - of - sight velocity co - ordinate ( position - position - velocity space or ppv ) in the same simulated galaxy .",
    "the goal is to assess whether the same objects can be identified in these two methods and if the properties are consistent .",
    "this work is on a larger - scale than the previously mentioned studies , comparing the properties of a global cloud populations which extragalactic observations are starting to capture .",
    "the simulated galaxy was modelled on the barred spiral ( sabc ) galaxy , m83 , using observational data from the 2mass k - band image @xcite to estimate the stellar potential .",
    "the simulation was run using the three dimensional adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) hydrodynamics code , ` enzo ` @xcite and is presented in @xcite , along with a full description of the run parameters .",
    "the gas radiatively cooled down to 300k ( a limit designed to allow for the lack of small - scale pressure from unresolved turbulence or magnetic fields ) but no star formation or feedback was included .    a projected face - on image of the gas density in the simulated galaxy",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig_sim_galaxies_full](a ) .",
    "the galaxy s bar and two spiral arms are visible , with the arms extending to a radius of @xmath13kpc and the bar - end at 2.3kpc .",
    "m83 is at a distance of 4.5mpc , corresponding to a resolution of 1@xmath5 @xmath14 20pc @xcite . in the simulation , the smallest cell size is @xmath15pc .    in @xcite ,",
    "the molecular clouds are identified in ppp space using two different methods .",
    "the main cloud identification method uses a continuous contour at a density of @xmath16@xmath17 . using this technique , they found gmcs came in three different types : _ type a _ clouds were the most commn gmcs , dominating the cloud populations in all regions and having properties that agreed with typical observations .",
    "_ type b _ clouds are massive giant molecular associations ( gmas ) created through multiple cloud interactions , and _ type c _ clouds are unbound , transient clouds , often found in tidal tails .",
    "the second method divided clouds within this contour if there are two peaks separated by at least 20pc ; a technique used in @xcite for cloud identification .",
    "we compare these two methods with clouds identified in a ppv synthetic observational data set of the same galaxy ( also known as a spectral line data cube ) .",
    "this data set type is commonly used in millimetre to submillimetre observations , which trace the gas in the ism . the line - of - sight direction which defines the velocity co - ordinate is along the @xmath18axis of the galaxy , observing the simulation face - on .",
    "the ppv data cube was created with a spatial and velocity spacing of 2pc ( slightly larger than the simulation cell size ) and 1km / s and included a gaussian thermal broadening with a width equal to the velocity dispersion of the gas .",
    "when identifying the clouds in the ppv data set , we assume the galaxy is observed in @xmath19co ( 10 ) .",
    "@xmath19co ( 10 ) is excited in low density molecular gas , making it is an ideal tracer of the entire molecular cloud .",
    "it also has a critical excitation density of @xmath20@xmath17 , allowing us to use a cloud identification threshold of @xmath21 @xmath22 100 @xmath17 , in keeping with the ppp schemes . for the ppv cube ,",
    "only cells with a density greater than the threshold value were included in the data .",
    "such a cut - off produces a projected image shown in figure  [ fig_sim_galaxies_full](b ) .",
    "( a )        ( b )    to assess how close our simulated clouds are to those observed in the galaxy , we plotted the ppv column density distribution and overlaid the typical values found for the galactic clouds in figure [ fig_column_density ] .",
    "the grey histogram shows the ppv distribution , with the typical column density marked by the black line .",
    "the galactic star - forming molecular clouds ( color lines include two galactic surveys ( yellow and cyan lines , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and three individual clouds : orion @xcite , perseus @xcite and taurus @xcite ( red lines ) , all estimated by co observations . the median column density for our ppv data ( @xmath23 = 21.7 @xmath24 ) is consistent to the typical values of the galactic clouds , where @xmath23 commonly ranges between 21.0  22.5 @xmath24 .",
    "this suggests that our results should apply well to genine observations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec_cloud_identification ] , we introduce four different cloud identification methods using ppv and ppp , and present two of these as the main methods in this work . section [ sec_results ] presents the comparison of the global properties between ppv- and ppp - clouds , as well as the one - to - one match cloud properties between two sets .",
    "classification of molecular clouds based on their physical properties is also shown in section [ sec_results ] . in section [ sec_diff_methods ] , we show a brief results of the two minor cloud identification methods .",
    "summary of this work is given in section [ sec_summary ] .",
    "overlaid are the typical column densities of the galactic clouds .",
    "median column density of our ppv gas is @xmath25(h@xmath26 ) @xmath22 21.7 @xmath24 ( black line ) .",
    "typical column densities that @xcite and @xcite suggest from their galactic surveys are plotted with yellow and cyan solid lines at @xmath6 21.9 and @xmath6 21.7 @xmath24 , respectively",
    ". typical column density of the orion molecular cloud is @xmath6 22.3 @xmath24 ( red dashed line , * ? ? ?",
    "clouds perseus and taurus , have similar column density of @xmath6 21.3 @xmath24 ( red dotted line , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "all the galactic values are measured with co observations.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "for both our data sets in ppp and ppv , we used two cloud identification methods .",
    "the first method identifies continuous structures of gas above our chosen density or flux threshold , which we refer to as _ islands_. the second method can further segregate these bodies into smaller objects such that each contains a single local maxima .",
    "we refer to this as the _ decomposition _ method .",
    "ppp clouds are identified in the original data from the simulation , while clouds are found in ppv space by first creating a ppv data cube from the simulation data and passing this in fits format to the cprops package @xcite .",
    "cprops expects the data to be emission intensity , rather than the gas density followed by simulations . to convert between the two , we use a co - to - h@xmath27 conversation factor @xcite to change the physical unit ( g @xmath24 ) to observed @xmath19co ( 10 ) flux ( kelvin ) . since we do not consider chemistry ( to compute the exact co abundance ) nor radiative transfer and the excitation of molecular lines , this value is for an ideal circumstance",
    "this also means that the conversion factor cancels when we derive the cloud mass , so its precise value does not affect our results . since the flux threshold in cprops",
    "is determined by the ratio to the noise level ( @xmath28 ) , the so - called signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) , a low random noise with level of @xmath6 1 k is added to the ppv cube .",
    "this sensitivity is sufficient to identify the smallest identified galactic molecular clouds at about 5 @xmath28 level with our spatial ( @xmath6 2 pc ) and velocity resolution ( @xmath6 1 km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "these resolutions and sensitivity are higher than current alma observations , but technically achievable using the full - operation of alma and its long - baseline ability . while there is no doubt that resolution and sensitivity play a strong role in determining gmc properties , they are downstream of this work . instead , we focus on differences due to the techniques themselves in the absence of external factors .    the cloud boundaries in the island method are defined slightly differently in the two techniques .",
    "ppp works from the lowest density , drawing a contour at @xmath29@xmath17 and defining all cells within a closed section as the cloud .",
    "ppv via cprops begins by masking the emission with a high s / n , picking out the cloud locations at densities much higher than the background .",
    "it then extends this mask to the user defined lowest s / n , which outlines the observed cloud boundary .",
    "cprops then assumes that the real cloud boundary is larger than the observed cloud boundary , since the cloud outer regions are being obscured by the background noise .",
    "it therefore extrapolates from the observed boundary to a sensitivity of 0 k to form the real cloud boundary .    in the decomposition method ,",
    "the cloud boundaries are identified in a similar manner between ppp and ppv .",
    "ppp - clouds are located by searching for local maxima and the adjoining surrounding cells that are above the threshold @xmath30@xmath17 , assigning these to a single cloud . in the ppp data ,",
    "maxima closer than 20 pc arere merged into a single object .",
    "ppv via the cprops decomposition method initially uses the island method to find the continuous structures and then searches these for separate peaks . for computational speed",
    ", the search for island peaks is performed within a cube with a ( user - defined ) side of 22pc @xmath31 22pc @xmath31 7 km s@xmath3 .",
    "this size was selected to be comparable to the average gmc diameter and velocity dispersion in our simulation , ensuring that a single cloud would not be accidentally divided by our numerical choice .",
    "if multiple peaks are found within an island , cprops finds the lowest contour that surrounds both peaks and then separates them with a contour twice the rms noise above the shared boundary ( the default value suggested by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "all pixels within the separated contours are assigned to the peaks .",
    "cprops can potentially merge peaks within an island if their properties are sufficiently similar , but the high sensitivity of our analysis meant that this was not necessary @xcite .",
    "the physical properties of the clouds are then derived once the cloud boundaries are set .",
    "these derivations are not identical between the two methods , since the assumed raw data ( simulation or observation ) is measuring different quantities",
    ". we do not attempt to correct for this , but adopt the original calculations that are used to describe clouds in simulation and observational studies as part of the comparison between the two methods .    in both methods and data structures ,",
    "cloud mass ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) are calculated by the sum of the cells or pixels in the clouds .",
    "we note that a co - to - h@xmath26 conversion factor is required for the ppv data when moving between the observed flux and physical gas quantity .",
    "a conversion factor of 2 @xmath31 10@xmath34 @xmath24 ( k km s@xmath3)@xmath3 is adopted in this work , which is the default value of cprops . however ,",
    "this is used twice in the derivation of the cloud mass and cancels itself out due to the lack to chemistry , radiative transfer and excitation of molecular line in this work .",
    "we confirmed this by adopting a conversation factor differing by a factor of ten and recalculating the mass to achieve the same result.the mass in both methods is therefore the total mass of gas in cells within our clouds .    for the cloud radii and velocity dispersion properties ,",
    "the ppp and ppv calculations differ more significantly .",
    "the ppp data is calculated from three spatial and three velocity dimensions .",
    "it therefore measures the average radius ( @xmath35 ) of cloud from its three projected axes , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , and computes the mass - weighted one - dimensional velocity dispersion from the average deviations between the gas velocity and the cloud s bulk velocity velocity in @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 directions .",
    "in contrast to this , ppv must measure the properties projected along a single direction .",
    "to do this , cprops first calculates the geometric mean of the square root of the spatial mass(flux)-weighted second centralized moment .",
    "the root - mean - square ( rms ) ( standard deviation ) @xmath39 is the square root of the variance .",
    "] of the intensity distribution along the major and minor axes of the projected cloud boundary .",
    "quantitively , these are defined for each cloud as :    @xmath40    where the @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the rms size of the intensity distribution along the @xmath7 and @xmath8 axis , @xmath43 is the observed flux of the @xmath44th pixel within the cloud , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the position in the two spatial dimensions of the @xmath44th pixel and @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the flux - weighted mean positions of the cloud .",
    "the rms size of the cloud ( @xmath49 ) is the geometric mean of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , @xmath50 .",
    "the rms size is then converted into the effective radius ( @xmath51 ) by assuming a mass - centered density profile of a spherical cloud .",
    "this is to allow for the fact that the true cloud edge extends beyond the identified boundary of the cloud .",
    "the relation is simplified to @xmath52 , where the constant is an empirical correction derived from the resolved galactic gmcs in @xmath19co ( 10 ) observations @xcite .",
    "note that unlike the ppp radii , the @xmath51 value is weighted by the flux . in a similar fashion , the velocity dispersion ( @xmath53 ) for the ppv clouds is the flux - weighted rms velocity dispersion within the defined cloud boundary : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the velocity of the @xmath44th pixel within the cloud , @xmath56 is the flux - weighted mean velocity of the cloud .    for both the ppp and ppv methods , the mass surface density ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) , virial parameter ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) and virial mass ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 )",
    "are derived from the basic properties ( cloud mass , radius and velocity dispersion ) in the standard way : @xmath63 is defined as the mass per unit area and is therefore simply calculated from the cloud mass and radius .",
    "@xmath64 measures the gravitational binding of a cloud , assume a spherical profile and no magnetic support or pressure confinement .",
    "specifically , @xmath65 indicates that the cloud is gravitationally unbound while @xmath66 suggests a bound system .",
    "it is defined from the mass , radius and velocity dispersion of the cloud as @xmath67 .",
    "the virial mass comes from this parameter , @xmath68 .",
    "a visual comparison of the clouds found in the ppp and ppv data sets for the island method is shown in figure  [ fig_position_examples ] .",
    "the panels each show a different region of the galactic disc , with the projected gas density overlaid with red circles for the ppv clouds and green plus signs for the ppp clouds .",
    "the location of each symbol marks the cloud centre - of - mass , but the symbol size is not proportional to the cloud properties .",
    "panel ( a ) shows the inner disc region , around 1.2kpc from the galactic centre and within the grand design bar shown in figure  [ fig_sim_galaxies_full ] . due to the high number density of clouds in this region , this image size is @xmath69kpc , whereas panels ( b ) to ( d ) show a region of @xmath70kpc .",
    "these three panels step outwards from the disc , with panel ( b ) showing a region at 5.7kpc from the galactic centre , panel ( c ) at 6.8kpc from the centre and panel ( d ) at 7.7kpc from the centre and outside the spiral arms .",
    "notably , each ppp cloud typically has only one counterpart in ppv , even in the most crowded panel in figure  [ fig_position_examples](a ) .",
    "however , this is not universally true .",
    "each panel of figure  [ fig_position_examples ] displays examples of where either the ppp or ppv method has identified multiple clouds where the counter scheme finds a single object .",
    "a unique ppv cloud may have multiple ppp counterparts that are physically close with similar velocities , causing them to merge in the ppv projected data space .",
    "conversely , a ppp cloud may have multiple ppv counterparts if the level of the noise defining the cloud edge in ppv is higher ( or within a factor of two ) than the gas density between peaks within a single ppp cloud , causing the structure to split .",
    "for the gas to be detected in both ppp and ppv , it must be higher than 100@xmath17 and @xmath71g@xmath24 in projection .",
    "occassionally , this causes a ppp cloud to have no ppv counterpart at all , as shown in the top of panel ( a ) , where the small cloud diameter gave a projected density below the noise limit .",
    "these splits may also lead to the centre - of - mass of the clouds in a region not overlapping , producing an off - set as seen in the lower left corner of panel ( c ) .",
    "this agreement in cloud locations also extends to the cloud properties .",
    "table  [ tab_phy_prop_gal_str ] shows a comparison between the median properties of the clouds found by the ppv and ppp island methods .",
    "the top row shows the properties for the entire cloud population , while the next three rows takes an separate look at the bar , spiral and disc populations ( see next section ) . in all areas ,",
    "ppp finds slightly more clouds than in the ppv case , although the numbers differ by less than 10% .",
    "this indicates that the effect of merging ppp clouds due to projection effects is slightly more pronounced than splitting ppp clouds due to noise .",
    "both ppp and ppv clouds have masses around @xmath72@xmath73 and radii around 15pc .",

    "the _ type c _ clouds remain the most unbound object in the simulation , with virial parameters @xmath76 .",

    "clouds overlap more strongly than in the island method , again due to the smaller range in cloud properties .    in the ppv clouds using the decomposition method ,",
    "the three relations are lost , with the radius , mass and velocity dispersion no longer well correlated . in the mass - radius relation in panel ( d ) , the _ type c _ clouds do show the same general trend at the ppp clouds and island method , but with a much wider scatter . by contrast , the _ type a _ clouds suggest a reverse trend , where the mass anti - correlates with radius .",
    "this huge scatter is due to the watershed effect . in the cases were multiple peaks are within a massive island , all the peaks can share a high density envelope .",
    "this causes a large amount of material to be discarded , often up to @xmath77% of the emission 10@xmath78 m@xmath2 in ppv , and 1.8 @xmath31 10@xmath79 m@xmath2 in ppp . for comparison ,",

    "the result is small contours centered around a high density region , producing the trend in the _ type a _ clouds .",
    "this effect is most notable in the splitting of the massive _ type b _ clouds , which often contain concetrated cores of material that become small objects .",
    "extra scatter is also created from the mass - weighting of cprops on the radius , as discussed in previous sections . for the smaller _ type c",
    "_ clouds , the watershed effect simply increases radius scatter as clouds are divided .",
    "note that a significant number of _ type c _ clouds are split from the remains of the _ type b _ island method clouds , producing objects both larger and smaller than the original _ type c _ clouds .",
    "the splitting of islands into multiple peaks also reduces the velocity dispersion of the clouds for ppv , as shown in panel ( e ) .",
    "as only the partial structure ends up attacked to a peak , the velocity dispersion drops compared to the ppp case , where the extended envelope is not neglected . with the scatter in the radius , the _ type a _ and _ type c _ clouds strongly overlap and there is no visible trend with velocity dispersion .    where the virial parameter is plotted against radius in panel ( f ) ,",
    "the _ type a _ and _ type c _ clouds do occupy different region . _",
    "type a _ clouds have a virial parameter of @xmath80 ( mostly @xmath81 ) , while the _ c _ remain the most unbound objects with @xmath82 .",
    "this difference is actually more marked in the ppv data than the ppp , due to the reduced radius and velocity dispersion of the _ type a _ clouds which lowers the virial parameter .",
    "_ type c _ clouds occupy approximately the same plot region in both ppv and ppp , but with a wider scatter in the radius as seen before .",
    "exactly which method island or decomposition is more physical is up for debate .",
    "there is no reason why a cloud should contain a single peak and indeed , star formation is unlikely to be centred in only one location of a turbulent cloud .",
    "the use of the methods may depend on the quality of the observational data and the purpose of the study . for the extragalactic observations with typical resolution of @xmath83 20 pc ,",
    "most studies adopt the decomposition method to select objects .",
    "however , the resolution at these distances means it is hard to discern internal cloud structure , producing clouds that are similar in size to the island method in this work .",
    "on the other hand , inspite of the higher resolutions ( @xmath84 20 pc ) , most of galactic studies continue to adopt the decomposition method .",
    "this is due to the large dynamic range in the distance to the clouds , varying the resolution within a cloud s boundary .",
    "both these choices originate from the lack of a clear definition for a gmc , leaving is ambiguous as to whether it is resolved .",
    "our study emphasises the importance of this cloud definition and for high resolution data , the island method is the stronger choice for selecting similar objects in both simulation and observation data types ; a valuable asset in understanding the evolution of star - forming clouds .

    "we are rapidly reaching the point where simulations and observations will achieve comparable resolution of molecular cloud populations in a wide variety of galaxies .",
    "this opens the door to truly constrain the mechanisms for cloud formation and thereby star formation in different galaxy environments .",
    "the importance of this advance makes it imperative to examine carefully if the two techniques of observation and simulation are discussing the same star - forming molecular clouds .",
    "after all , observational data is done in two spatial co - ordinates and one velocity co - ordinate , while simulation data typically uses all three spatial dimensions , but ignores the velocity components .",
    "a direct match is not possible .    in this paper , we compared the physical properties of giant molecular clouds formed in a simulation of a barred spiral galaxy using simulation and observational identification methods .",
    "the two methods selected clouds from the data in position - position - position ( ppp ) space typical for simulation and position - position - velocity ( ppv ) space used in observations . the ppv data cube was assumed to be the product of @xmath19co ( 10 ) observations with optimal resolution and sensitivity .",
    "the properties of the clouds found in both methods were compared and the clouds themselves matched to assess whether the two methods identified the same objects and if the properties were method dependent .",
    "this process was repeated twice ; once where the clouds were identified as continuous structures within a contour ( `` island method '' ) and once where each peak in the density or emission was assigned to a seperate cloud ( `` decomposition method '' ) .      1 .",
    "the total number of clouds identified was similar in the ppv and ppp methods ( 971 versus 1029 ) .",
    "this was also true when comparing cloud numbers in each galactic environment of bar , spiral and disc .",
    "the typical ( median ) cloud properties , such as their mass , radius and velocity dispersion , differ by @xmath85% between ppv and ppp .",
    "the bimodal mass surface density distribution of ppp clouds ( peaks at @xmath6 100 and @xmath6 1000 m@xmath2 pc@xmath75 ) which had been found by @xcite is reproduced in the ppv clouds , with the boundary between the two populations being roughly consistent .      1 .",
    "about 70% of clouds have single counterpart in both data sets .",
    "this match rate was consisted in all three galactic environments .",
    "the variation in properties between matched clouds typically lies within a scatter of a factor of two .",
    "the largest scatter is seen for the derived properties , that depend on multiple cloud variables , such as the surface density and the virial parameter .",
    "the differences in these properties suggest care should be taken when interpreting their physical meaning .",
    "3 .   smaller clouds ( @xmath86 10@xmath87 m@xmath2 )",
    "have a larger scatter in their velocity dispersion because the velocity spacing of our ppv ( 1 km s@xmath3 ) data cube is too large to resolve the velocity dispersion of these small objects .",
    "this provides a guide of the velocity ( instrumental spectral ) resolution needed for real observations .    in the analysis of this simulation",
    "presented in @xcite using the ppp cloud identification method , clouds were found to fall into three different populations : the _ type a _ clouds which have cloud properties agreeing with typical observations and account for the largest fraction of clouds in all galactic environments .",
    "the _ type b _ massive associations that form through mergers of small clouds and are therefore seen in high - interaction environments like the bar more commonly than the disc .",
    "finally , the _ type c _ clouds that are transient , unbound objects , forming in filaments and tidal tails , making them most common where the gravitationally dominant _ type b _ clouds are prevalent .",
    "when classifying ppv clouds with the same definitions , the main results are :    1 .   the fraction of each cloud type differs by @xmath84 10% between ppv and ppp in all environments .",
    "2 .   among the @xmath88% of clouds that have a direct match in both data sets , as high as @xmath89%",
    "are categorised as same type in all environments .",
    "the remaining 10% that differ change type due to the different mass and/or radius between two data sets .    when we switched from identifying clouds as continuous islands to the peak - based decomposition method , the number of clouds found in both ppp and ppv increases significantly by @xmath6 3 times .",
    "the resulting cloud properties for the overall population remained similar , but the one - to - one cloud match became significantly more difficult in the crowded environment and the match rate dropped to 40% .",
    "the division of clouds such that they contain only a single peak also made the cloud properties more uniform , largely obscuring the three cloud types seen in the island method .",
    "this was particularly true in the ppv data set , which had a large amount of scatter in cloud properties .",
    "we conclude that the cloud identification method therefore plays a critical role in determining the cloud properties and therefore understanding the influence of galactic environment .    finally , we emphasize that the resolution of our data means we are only considering the `` best possible '' situation .",
    "our ppv data cube has minimal noise and much higher resolution than typical observations .",
    "based on a simple estimation for alma observations using the simulation function of casa , it is unlikely we can achieve such a fine resolution and deep observation for the entirety of m83 within a reasonable time for cycle 3 ( 2015  2016 ) observations , although a partial galaxy may be possible . as an example , figure [ fig_m83_casa ] shows the simulated spectrum for the three types of cloud derived from a @xmath6 2-hour alma cycle 3 observations of m83 ( including calibrators ) using casa ( the common astronomy software applications package , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , assuming a 2.6 @xmath31 3.0 kpc observed area in the bar and spiral regions .",
    "we have also ignored the inclination of the galaxy , chemical processes and radiation transfer in the ism .",
    "such effects would alter the observed column density of molecular clouds and also raise the difficulty in identifying the clouds themselves .    for our main results using the island method , we conclude that both ppp and ppv can potentially identify the same objects with close properties .",
    "therefore , the techniques themselves are able to be compared well .",
    "the question then becomes one of fighting down noise and achieving the necessary resolution to understand cloud and star formation in galaxies .",
    "the next step in this work is to evaluate the projection effect as a function of different inclinations of galactic discs and physical resolutions .",
    "this will provide a set of reference gmcs to help observers to declare the intrinsic bias in the their observed gmc properties .",
    "2 hours ( @xmath6 5 hours is required if the aca total power observations are included .",
    "this is certainly necessary in real observations ) .",
    "the mapping area is 130@xmath5 @xmath31 150@xmath5 ( 2.6 @xmath31 3.0 kpc ) .",
