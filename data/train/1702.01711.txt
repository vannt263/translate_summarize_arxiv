    "opinion mining and sentiment analysis are important for determining opinions about commercial products , on companies reputation management , brand monitoring , or to track attitudes by mining social media , etc . given the explosion of information produced and shared via the internet , it is not possible to keep up with the constant flow of new information by manual methods .",
    "sentiment analysis often relies on the availability of words and phrases annotated according to the positive or negative connotations they convey . `",
    "beautiful ' , ` wonderful ' , and ` amazing ' are examples of positive words whereas ` bad ' , ` awful ' , and ` poor ' are examples of negatives .",
    "the creation of lists of sentiment words has generally been performed by means of manual- , dictionary- and corpus - based methods . manually collecting such lists of polarity annotated words",
    "is labor intensive and time consuming , and is thus usually combined with automated approaches as the final check to correct mistakes .",
    "however , there are well known lexicons which have been fully @xcite or at least partially _ manually created _ @xcite .",
    "_ dictionary - based _ methods rely on some dictionary or lexical knowledge base ( lkb ) such as wordnet @xcite that contain synonyms and antonyms for each word .",
    "a simple technique in this approach is to start with some sentiment words as seeds which are then used to perform some iterative propagation on the lkb @xcite .",
    "_ corpus - based _ methods have usually been applied to obtain domain - specific polarity lexicons : they have been created by either starting from a seed list of known words and trying to find other related words in a corpus or by attempting to directly adapt a given lexicon to a new one using a domain - specific corpus @xcite .",
    "one particular issue arising from corpus methods is that for a given domain the same word can be positive in one context but negative in another .",
    "this is also a problem shared by manual and dictionary - based methods , and that is why _ qwn - ppv _ also produces synset - based lexicons for approaches on sentiment analysis at sense level .",
    "this paper presents a simple , robust and ( almost ) unsupervised dictionary - based method , _ qwordnet - ppv _ ( qwordnet by personalized pagerank vector ) to automatically generate polarity lexicons based on propagating some automatically created seeds using a personalized pagerank algorithm @xcite over a lkb projected into a graph .",
    "we see _ qwn - ppv _ as an effective methodology to easily create polarity lexicons for any language for which a wordnet is available .",
    "this paper empirically shows that : ( i ) _ qwn - ppv _ outperforms other automatically generated lexicons ( e.g. sentiwordnet 3.0 , msol ) on the 4 extrinsic evaluations presented here ; it also displays competitive and robust results also with respect to manually annotated lexicons ; ( ii ) no single polarity lexicon is fit for every sentiment analysis task ; depending on the text data and the task itself , one lexicon will perform better than others ; ( iii ) if required , _ qwn - ppv _ efficently generates many lexicons on demand , depending on the task on which they will be used ; ( iv ) intrinsic evaluation is not appropriate to judge whether a polarity lexicon is fit for a given sentiment analysis ( sa ) task because good correlation with respect to a _ gold - standard _ does not correspond with _ correlation _ with respect to a sa task ; ( v ) it is easily applicable to create _ qwn - ppv(s ) _ for _ other languages _ , and we demonstrate it here by creating many polarity lexicons not only for english but also for spanish ; ( vi ) the method works at _ both word and sense _ levels and it only requires the availability of a lkb or dictionary ; finally , ( vii ) a dictionary - based method like _ qwn - ppv _ allows to easily create quality polarity lexicons whenever no domain - based annotated reviews are available for a given language .",
    "after all , there usually is available a dictionary for a given language ; for example , the open multilingual wordnet site lists wordnets for up to 57 languages @xcite .    although there has been previous work using graph methods for obtaining lexicons via propagation , the _ qwn - ppv _ method to combine the seed generation and the personalized pagerank propagation is novel . furthermore , it is considerable simpler and obtains better and easier to reproduce results than previous automatic approaches @xcite .",
    "next section reviews previous related work , taking special interest on those that are currently available for evaluation purposes . section [ sec : extr - polar - from ] describes the _ qwn - ppv _ method to automatically generate lexicons .",
    "the resulting lexical resources are evaluated in section [ sec : evaluation ] .",
    "we finish with some concluding remarks and future work in section [ sec : concluding - remarks ] .",
    "there is a large amount of work on sentiment analysis and opinion mining , and good comprehensive overviews are already available @xcite , so we will review the most representative and closest to the present work .",
    "this means that we will not be reviewing corpus - based approaches but rather those constructed manually or upon a dictionary or lkb .",
    "we will in turn use the approaches here reviewed for comparison with _ qwn - ppv _ in section [ sec : evaluation ] .",
    "the most popular manually - built polarity lexicon is part of the general inquirer @xcite , and consists of 1915 words labelled as `` positive '' and 2291 as `` negative '' .",
    "manually created their lexicons annotating the polarity of 6232 words on a scale of 5 to -5 .",
    "et al . _ , starting with hu and liu , have along the years collected a manually corrected polarity lexicon which is formed by 4818 negative and 2041 positive words . another manually corrected lexicon @xcite is the one used by the opinion finder system @xcite and contains 4903 negatively and 2718 positively annotated words respectively .    among the automatically built lexicons , turney and littman proposed a minimally supervised algorithm to calculate the polarity of a word depending on whether it co - ocurred more with a previously collected small set of positive words rather than with a set of negative ones .",
    "agerri and garca serrano presented a very simple method to extract the polarity information starting from the _ quality _ synset in wordnet @xcite .",
    "_ developed a method in which they first identify ( by means of affixes rules ) a set of positive / negative words which act as seeds , then used a roget - like thesaurus to mark the synonymous words for each polarity type and to generalize from the seeds .",
    "they produce several lexicons the best of which , msol(asl and gi ) contains 51k and 76k entries respectively and uses the full general inquirer as seeds .",
    "they performed both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations using the mpqa 1.1 corpus .    finally , there are two approaches that are somewhat closer to us , because they are based on wordnet and graph - based methods .",
    "sentiwordnet 3.0 @xcite is built in 4 steps : ( i ) they select the synsets of 14 paradigmatic positive and negative words used as seeds @xcite .",
    "these seeds are then iteratively extended following the construction of wordnet - affect @xcite .",
    "( ii ) they train 7 supervised classifiers with the synsets glosses which are used to assign _ polarity _ and _ objectivity _ scores to wordnet senses .",
    "( iii ) in sentiwordnet 3.0 @xcite they take the output of the supervised classifiers as input to applying pagerank to wordnet 3.0 s graph .",
    "( iv ) they intrinsically evaluate it with respect to micrownop-3.0 using the _ p - normalized kendall @xmath0 distance _ @xcite .",
    "rao and ravichandran apply different semi - supervised graph algorithms ( mincuts , randomized mincuts and label propagation ) to a set of seeds constructed from the general inquirer .",
    "they evaluate the generated lexicons intrinsically taking the general inquirer as the gold standard for those words that had a match in the generated lexicons .    in this paper",
    ", we describe two methods to automatically generate seeds either by following agerri and garca - serrano or using turney and littman s seeds .",
    "the automatically obtained seeds are then fed into a personalized pagerank algorithm which is applied over a wordnet projected on a graph .",
    "this method is fully automatic , simple and unsupervised as it only relies on the availability of a lkb .",
    "the overall procedure of our approach consists of two steps : * ( 1 ) * automatically creates a set of seeds by iterating over a lkb ( e.g. a wordnet ) relations ; and * ( 2 ) * uses the seeds to initialize contexts to propagate over the lkb graph using a personalized pagerank algorithm .",
    "the result is _ qwn - ppv(s ) _ : q - wordnets as personalized pageranking vectors .",
    "we generate seeds by means of two different automatic procedures .    1 .   * ag * : we start at the _ quality synset _ of wordnet and iterate over wordnet relations following the original q - wordnet method described in agerri and garca serrano .",
    "* tl * : we take a short manually created list of 14 positive and negative words @xcite and iterate over wordnet using five relations : _ antonymy , similarity , derived - from , pertains - to and also - see_.    the * ag * method starts the propagation from the attributes of the _ quality synset _ in wordnet .",
    "there are five noun quality senses in wordnet , two of which contain attribute relations ( to adjectives ) . from the _",
    "quality@xmath1 _ synset the attribute relation takes us to _ positive@xmath2 _ , _ negative@xmath2 _ , _",
    "good@xmath2 _ and _ bad@xmath2 _ ; _ quality@xmath3 _ leads to the attributes _",
    "superior@xmath2 _ and _ inferior@xmath4_. the following step is to iterate through every wordnet relation collecting ( i.e. , annotating ) those synsets that are accessible from the seeds . both _",
    "ag _ and _ tl _ methods to generate seeds rely on a number of relations to obtain a more balanced pos distribution in the output synsets .",
    "the output of both methods is a list of ( assumed to be ) positive and negative synsets .",
    "depending on the number of iterations performed a different number of seeds to feed ukb is obtained .",
    "seed numbers vary from 100 hundred to 10k synsets .",
    "both seed creation methods can be applied to any wordnet , not only princeton wordnet , as we show in section [ sec : evaluation ] .",

    "this step requires :    1 .",
    "a lkb projected over a graph .",
    "2 .   a personalized pageranking algorithm which is applied over the graph .",
    "3 .   seeds to create contexts to start the propagation , either words or synsets .",
    "several undirected graphs based on wordnet 3.0 as represented by the mcr 3.0 @xcite have been created for the experimentation , which correspond to 4 main sets : ( g1 ) two graphs consisting of every synset linked by the _ synonymy _ and _ antonymy _ relations ; ( g2 ) a graph with the nodes linked by every relation , including glosses ; ( g3 ) a graph consisting of the synsets linked by every relation except those that are linked by _",
    "antonymy _ ; finally , ( g4 ) a graph consisting of the nodes related by every relation except the _ antonymy _ and _ gloss _ relations .",
    "using the ( g1 ) graphs , we propagate from the seeds over each type of graph ( synonymy and antonymy ) to obtain two rankings per polarity .",
    "the graphs created in ( g2 ) , ( g3 ) and ( g4 ) are used to obtain two ranks , one for each polarity by propagating from the seeds . in all four cases the different polarity rankings have to be combined in order to obtain a final polarity lexicon : the polarity score _",
    "pol(s ) _ of a given synset _",
    "s _ is computed by adding its scores in the positive rankings and subtracting its scores in the negative rankings . if _",
    "pol(s ) _ @xmath5 then _ s _ is included in the final lexicon as positive . if _",
    "pol(s ) _ @xmath6 then _ s _",
    "is included in the final lexicon as negative .",
    "we assume that synsets with _ null _",
    "polarity scores have no polarity and consequently they are excluded from the final lexicon .",
    "the personalized pageranking propagation is performed starting from both synsets and words and using both _",
    "ag _ and _ tl _ styles of seed generation , as explained in section [ sec : qwn :- seed - generation ] . combining the various possibilities",
    "will produce at least 6 different lexicons for each iteration , depending on which decisions are taken about which graph , seeds and word / synset to create the _ qwn - ppv_(s ) .",
    "in fact , the experiments produced hundreds of lexicons , according to the different iterations for seed generation , but we will only refer to those that obtain the best results in the extrinsic evaluations .    with respect to the algorithm to propagate over the wordnet graph from the automatically created seeds , we use a personalized pagerank algorithm @xcite .",
    "the famous pagerank @xcite algorithm is a method to produce a rank from the vertices in a graph according to their relative structural importance .",
    "pagerank has also been viewed as the result of a random walk process , where the final rank of a given node represents the probability of a random walk over the graph which ends on that same node .",
    "thus , if we take the created wordnet graph @xmath7 with @xmath8 vertices @xmath9 and @xmath10 as being the outdegree of node @xmath11 , plus a @xmath12 transition probability matrix @xmath13 where @xmath14 if a link from @xmath11 to @xmath15 exists and 0 otherwise , then calculating the pagerank vector over a graph @xmath7 amounts to solve the following equation ( [ eq : pr ] ) :    @xmath16    in the traditional pagerank , vector * v * is a uniform normalized vector whose elements values are all @xmath17 , which means that all nodes in the graph are assigned the same probabilities in case of a random walk .",
    "personalizing the pagerank algorithm in this case means that it is possible to make vector * v * non - uniform and assign stronger probabilities to certain nodes , which would make the algorithm to propagate the initial importance of those nodes to their vicinity . following agirre _",
    "et al . _ , in our approach this translates into initializing vector * v * with those senses obtained by the seed generation methods described above in section [ sec : qwn :- seed - generation ] .",
    "thus , the initialization of vector * v * using the seeds allows the personalized propagation to assign greater importance to those synsets in the graph identified as being positive and negative , which resuls in a ppv with the weigths skewed towards those nodes initialized / personalized as positive and negative .",

    "we also provide such evaluation in section [ sect : intrinsic - eval ] . nevertheless , and as demonstrated by the results of the extrinsic evaluations , we believe that polarity lexicons should in general be evaluated _",
    "extrinsically_. after all , any polarity lexicon is as good as the results obtained by using it for a particular sentiment analysis task .",
    "our goal is to evaluate the polarity lexicons simplifying the evaluation parameters to avoid as many external influences as possible on the results .",
    "we compare our work with most of the lexicons reviewed in section [ sec : previous ] , both at synset and word level , both manually and automatically generated : general inquirer ( * gi * ) , opinion finder ( * of * ) , * liu * , taboada _ et al.s_ ( * so - cal * ) , agerri and garca - serrano ( * qwn * ) , mohammad _ et al s _ , ( * msol(asl - gi ) * ) and sentiwordnet 3.0 ( * swn * ) . the results presented in section [ sec : results ] show that _ extrinsic _ evaluation is more meaningful to determine the adequacy of a polarity lexicon for a specific sentiment analysis task .",
    "three different corpora were used : bespalov _ et al.s_ and mpqa @xcite for english , and hopinion in spanish . in addition",
    ", we divided the corpus into two subsets ( 75% development and 25% test ) for applying our ratio system for the phrase polarity task too . note that the development set is only used to set up the polarity classification task , and that the generation of _ qwn - ppv _ lexicons is unsupervised .    for spanish we tried to reproduce the english settings with bespalov s corpus .",
    "thus , both development and test sets were created from the hopinion corpus .",
    "as it contains a much higher proportion of positive reviews , we created also subsets which contain a balanced number of positive and negative reviews to allow for a more meaningful comparison than that of table [ tab : evalspanishfull ] .",
    "table [ tab : datasets ] shows the number of documents per polarity for bespalov s , mpqa 1.2 and hopinion .",
    ".number of positive and negative documents in train and test sets . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      _ qwn - ppv _ lexicons obtain the best results among the evaluations for english and spanish .",
    "furthermore , across tasks and datasets _ qwn - ppv _ provides a more consistent and robust behaviour than most of the manually - built lexicons apart from of .",
    "the results also show that for a task requiring high recall the larger graphs , e.g. g3 , are preferable , whereas for a more balanced dataset and document level task smaller g1 graphs perform better .",
    "these are good results considering that our method to generate _ qwn - ppv _ is simpler , more robust and adaptable than previous automatic approaches .",
    "furthermore , although also based on a personalized pagerank application , it is much simpler than sentiwordnet 3.0 , consistently outperformed by _ qwn - ppv _ on every evaluation and dataset .",
    "the main differences with respect to sentiwordnet s approach are the following : ( i ) the seed generation and training of 7 supervised classifiers corresponds in _ qwn - ppv _ to only one simple step , namely , the automatic generation of seeds as explained in section [ sec : qwn :- seed - generation ] ; ( ii ) the generation of _ qwn - ppv _ only requires a lkb s graph for the personalized pagerank propagation , no disambiguated glosses ; ( iii ) the graph they use to do the propagation also depends on disambiguated glosses , not readily available for any language .    the fact that _ qwn - ppv _ is based on already available wordnets projected onto simple graphs is crucial for the robustness and adaptability of the _ qwn - ppv _ method across evaluation tasks and datasets : our method can quickly create , over different graphs ,",
    "many lexicons of diffent sizes which can then be evaluated on a particular polarity classification task and dataset .",
    "hence the different configurations of the _ qwn - ppv _ lexicons , because for some tasks a g3 graph with more ag / tl seed iterations will obtain better recall and viceversa .",
    "this is confirmed by the results : the tasks using mpqa seem to clearly benefit from high recall whereas the bespalov s corpus has overall , more balanced scores .",
    "this could also be due to the size of bespalov s corpus , almost 10 times larger than mpqa 1.2 .",
    "the experiments to generate spanish lexicons confirm the trend showed by the english evaluations : lexicons generated by _ qwn - ppv _ consistenly outperform other automatic approaches , although some manual lexicon is better on a given task and dataset ( usually a different one ) .",
    "nonetheless the spanish evaluation shows that our method is also robust across languages as it gets quite close to the manually corrected lexicon of mihalcea(full ) @xcite .",
    "the results also confirm that no single lexicon is the most appropriate for any sa task or dataset and domain . in this sense ,",
    "the adaptability of _ qwn - ppv _ is a desirable feature for lexicons to be employed in sa tasks : the unsupervised _",
    "qwn - ppv _ method only relies on the availability of a lkb to build hundreds of polarity lexicons which can then be evaluated on a given task and dataset to choose the best fit .",
    "if not annotated evaluation set is available , g3-based propagations provide the best recall whereas the g1-based lexicons are less noisy .",
    "finally , we believe that the results reported here point out to the fact that intrinsic evaluations are not meaningful to judge the adequacy a polarity lexicon for a specific sa task .",
    "this paper presents an unsupervised dictionary - based method _ qwn - ppv _ to automatically generate polarity lexicons . although simpler than similar automatic approaches , it still obtains better results on the four extrinsic evaluations presented . because it only depends on the availability of a lkb , we believe that this method can be valuable to generate on - demand polarity lexicons for a given language when not sufficient annotated data is available .",
    "we demonstrate the adaptability of our approach by producing good performance polarity lexicons for different evaluation scenarios and for more than one language .",
    "further work includes investigating different graph projections of wordnet relations to do the propagation as well as exploiting synset weights .",
    "we also plan to investigate the use of annotated corpora to generate lexicons at word level to try and close the gap with those that have been ( at least partially ) manually annotated .",

    "<S> this paper presents a simple , robust and ( almost ) unsupervised dictionary - based method , _ qwn - ppv _ ( q - wordnet as personalized pageranking vector ) to automatically generate polarity lexicons . </S>",
    "<S> we show that _ qwn - ppv _ outperforms other automatically generated lexicons for the four extrinsic evaluations presented here . </S>",
    "<S> it also shows very competitive and robust results with respect to manually annotated ones . </S>",
    "<S> results suggest that no single lexicon is best for every task and dataset and that the intrinsic evaluation of polarity lexicons is not a good performance indicator on a sentiment analysis task . </S>",
    "<S> the _ qwn - ppv _ method allows to easily create quality polarity lexicons whenever no domain - based annotated corpora are available for a given language . </S>"
