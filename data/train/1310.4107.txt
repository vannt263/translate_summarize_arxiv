    "most of these sources are `` slow accretors '' , i.e. , their luminosities are well below the eddington limit .    in this paper",
    "we assume that all bhs are powered by accretion via a central , optically thick accretion flow that takes the shape of an accretion disk ( ad ) .",
    "we use the same general notation for all such flows , where @xmath22 is the `` eddington ratio '' . here , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the bolometric and eddington luminosity , respectively , @xmath25 is the mass accretion rate through the disk , @xmath26 is the efficiency of converting accreted mass to radiation and @xmath27 is the `` eddington rate '' .",

    "this has important implications to the process of cosmic growth of bhs , the duty cycle of activity , etc .",
    "a recent paper by wang et al . ( 2013 ) suggests that super - eddington accreting massive black holes ( seambhs ) , those objects with @xmath37 and 2 - 10 kev photon index ( @xmath38 ) larger than 2 , can be used as a new type of cosmological candles .",
    "the method is based on the fact that the bolometric luminosity of slim accretion disks around massive bhs tends to saturate at super - eddington rates . under such conditions ,",
    "@xmath39 with only a weak logarithmic dependence on @xmath34 .",
    "this idea , if confirmed by more accurate measurements , can provide a useful tool for measuring cosmological distances at high redshifts , where supernovae ( sne ) are hard to detect or are rare ( hook 2012 ) because of their slow evolution ( kobayashi & nomota 2009 ) .",
    "seambhs are very luminous , and can be easily detected in large numbers up to very high redshifts ( netzer and trakhtenbrot 2013 ) .",
    "in addition , their properties may not depend in any way on galaxy evolution .",
    "however , there are a very small number of such sources with accurately measured bh mass in the local universe and a systematic study is necessary to test these ideas .",
    "we have started a large observational project , in china , aimed at increasing considerably the number of high@xmath40 systems with good rm measurements that will allow reliable estimates of @xmath8 .",

    "2 ) probe the physics and dynamics of the blr gas in very fast accretors .",
    "3 ) improve the understanding of co - evolution of galaxies and their central bhs in extreme cases where mass accretion , and hence bh growth , are very fast .",

    "we assume a @xmath41cdm cosmology with @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 in light of planck observations ( ade et al .",
    "the most important criterion for the selection of targets is based on their normalized accretion rate as estimated by the ( less accurate ) single - epoch method . in particular , we search for objects with @xmath45 . as explained , the suggestion is that in such cases , the radiative efficiency @xmath26 is no longer a simple function of the bh spin and advection becomes an important process that affects the source luminosity .",
    "we decided to avoid radio loud agns although , in a few cases , a radio loud source was discovered after the project had begun .",
    "such cases will be discussed separately .    selecting agns by their high accretion rates",
    "depends on their @xmath46 which in itself depends on the sed .",
    "unfortunately , in standard ads , much of the radiation is emitted beyond the lyman limit at 912 ( laor and netzer 1989 ; elvis et al .",
    "1994 ; marconi et al . 2004",
    "; richards et al . 2006 ; davis and laor 2011 ; elvis et al .",
    "according to the standard ss model , the optical bolometric correction factor , @xmath47 , i.e. , the factor converting @xmath20 measured at optical wavelengths to @xmath46 , depends on the accretion rate and bh mass such that @xmath48 . for ads around @xmath49 black holes , this agrees with global empirical estimates that suggest @xmath50 ( e.g. , marconi et al . 2004 ) .",
    "however , much larger and much smaller values of @xmath47 are predicted by thin ad models for smaller and larger bhs , respectively ( see specific examples in netzer and trakhtenbrot 2013 ) .",
    "since most of the @xmath51 measured bh masses in the rm campaign have bh masses that fall below @xmath52 , we suspect that @xmath33 in at least several of these sources has been underestimated in the past .",
    "thus , at least some of these sources can be seambhs .    alternatively , we can select targets based on the slope of their 2 - 10 kev x - ray continuum . as argued in wang et al . (",
    "2013 ) , some seambh models predict that such objects would show steeper x - ray slopes compared with low-@xmath33 sources . while a possible @xmath53 relation has been suggested by wang et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , this depends on the poorly understood disk - corona structure .",
    "the underlying physics is based on the link between the accretion rate in the cold gas phase , the increased emission from the uv and optical bands , and the enhancement of comptonization cooling , leading to a suppressed hot corona emission . a correlation between @xmath33 and @xmath38",
    "has indeed been reported in both low and high luminosity agns ( see e.g. , wang et al . 2004 ; risaliti et al .",

    "a sample of 60 seambh candidates selected from the literature was presented by wang et al .",
    "the @xmath53 correlation in this sample is strong but with a large scatter .",
    "much of the scatter can be the result of the uncertain bh masses and bolometric luminosities of these sources .",

    "the typical sampling frequency is very high and for most sources we managed to obtain high quality spectra almost every night .",
    "observations of a particular object were terminated when a clear line - to - continuum lag was detected and measured .",
    "the mean number of nights per source was about @xmath83 and the mean monitoring period about 8 times the h@xmath0 delay .",
    "we took advantage of the long slit capability of the yfosc and observed a nearby standard star along the slit for all objects .",
    "as explained in detail in the original papers adopting this method ( maoz et al .",

    "selection of comparison stars is based on the images of the sdss and the typical separation between targets and comparison stars is @xmath84 . given the seeing conditions , the entrance slit was fixed at projected width of @xmath85 .",
    "all the spectra were obtained using yfosc with grism 14 which provides a resolution of 92 mm@xmath80 ( 1.8pixel@xmath80 ) and covers the wavelength range of @xmath86 . for each object / comparison star",
    ", we obtained three consecutive exposures in order to remove cosmic - rays and estimate the systematic flux calibration errors .",
    "standard neon and helium lamps are used for wavelength calibration .",
    "the spectroscopic data are reduced using standard iraf v2.16 routines before absolute flux calibration .",
    "all spectra are extracted in a uniform , rather large extraction aperture of 30 pixels ( @xmath87 8.5 arcsec ) to avoid light losses .",
    "the flux calibration is done in two steps : ( 1 ) absolute flux spectra of the comparison stars are generated using the observations of spectrophotometric standards in several nights of good weather conditions .",
    "this results in fiducial fluxed spectra for all comparison stars .",
    "( 2 ) for each object / comparison star pair , a sensitivity function is obtained by comparing the spectrum of the star to the fiducial spectrum .",
    "this produces a sensitivity function that is applied to calibrate the observed agn spectrum .",
    "this step resembles the iraf _ sensfunc _ and _ calibration _ , and it also resembles the method of agn / star ratio that was used by maoz et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and kaspi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "we also made photometric observations through a johnson @xmath88-filter of all targets and comparison stars .",
    "this allows us to test the quality of the comparison star calibration and the continuum light curves .",
    "the observations are done just before the spectroscopic observations with typical exposure times of 45 minutes for a @xmath89 target .",
    "the images are reduced using standard iraf procedures .",
    "we perform differential photometry of the targets relative to several other stars in the same field .",
    "the number of comparison stars is typically @xmath90 .",
    "the radius of the aperture photometry is @xmath91 and the typical photometric accuracy 12% .",
    "we use two continuum bands , 4760 - 4790 and 5085 - 5115 , in the rest frame , to set the continuum underneath the h@xmath0 emission line .",
    "we then integrate the continuum - subtracted h@xmath0 flux between 4810 and 4910 .",
    "the red limit of the band is chosen to exclude the line at around 4924 , which is strong in some of the objects .",
    "two kinds of error bars are calculated for the continuum flux .",
    "first , for the consecutive exposures in the same night , after flux calibration by the comparison star described above , the mean flux of each exposure over the entire wavelength range is calculated .",
    "then the mean fluxes of exposures are divided by that of the combined spectrum in that night to yield flux ratios .",
    "the largest deviation of the ratios from unity is used as an error bar .",
    "second , the poisson error of the measured continuum flux is calculated from the combined spectrum in the corresponding continuum band .",
    "typically the two error bars are comparable ( both @xmath92 ) , but there are exceptions where one of the two dominates .",
    "the two error bars are summed in quadrature as the final uncertainty of the continuum flux . for the error bar of the emission line flux",
    ", only poisson noise is calculated .",
    "the first kind of error , difference between consecutive exposures , includes the change in the host galaxy contamination .",
    "the emission line fluxes should be unaffected by such changes .",
    "thus , the difference between consecutive exposures is not inherited .",
    "the above error bars on the continuum flux do not account for systematic uncertainties that can be caused by poor weather conditions , bright moon , telescope tracking inaccuracies , slit positioning , etc .",
    "these are manifested as flux differences between adjacent nights that are significantly larger than the mean continuum variations over this period ( the variability time scale for all sources is much longer than one day ) . to estimate these uncertainties we first smooth the continuum light curve with a median filter of 56 points .",
    "we then subtract this median - smoothed light curve from the original light curve and obtained the standard deviation from the residuals .",
    "this serves as an estimate of the systematic uncertainty .",
    "the systematic uncertainties are usually larger than those associated with the measurements in one night and are therefore the largest contributors to the total errors that go into the ccf analysis and the calculated time - lag uncertainties ( there are several exceptions where errors on individual points are larger than the systematic uncertainties ) .",
    "this method is very similar to the one described by peterson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and bentz et al . (",
    "2009 ) .",
    "we constructed line and continuum light curves for all of the sources .",
    "some of the photometric observations are seriously influenced by moon light when a target is close to the moon .",
    "while the spectroscopic light curves follow the photometric ones , the agreement between the two is influenced by host galaxy contamination .",
    "this is the result of the constant slit width in all observations that may result in different host galaxy contributions on different nights .",
    "the leading factors are seeing variations , inaccurate centering of the target and inaccurate tracking .",
    "the host galaxy contribution can change slightly from one night to the next , which can affect the agn light curve .      to characterize the continuum variability of the sources we use the variability characteristic @xmath93 defined by rodrguez - pascual et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the averaged flux , @xmath96 is the number of observations and @xmath97 here @xmath98 represents the uncertainty on the flux @xmath99 .",
    "below we apply eqn ( 4 ) to the @xmath88-band , @xmath100 and @xmath101 light curves .",
    "we employed two standard methods to analyze the correlation between the line and continuum light curves : the interpolated cross - correlation function ( iccf , gaskell & sparke 1986 ; gaskell & peterson 1987 ) and the z - transformed discrete correlation function ( zdcf , alexander 1997 ) .",
    "the latter is an improvement on the discrete correlation function ( dcf ) of edelson & krolik ( 1988 ) .",
    "the results of the two are in excellent agreement and we only quote the time lags obtained with the iccf .",
    "the delay of the emission lines relative to the continuum variations is determined either by measuring the location of the peak of the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) ( @xmath102 ) or the centroid of the points around the peak above a certain threshold , e.g. , 80% ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "we note the two by @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the uncertainties on @xmath104 and @xmath105 were calculated with the `` flux randomization(fr)/random subset sampling ( rss ) '' method .",
    "this procedure is described in peterson et al .",
    "( 1998 ; 2004 ) and will not be repeated here .      in order to obtain the eddington ratios ( eqn .",
    "3 ) , we have to subtract the contaminations of host galaxies . following the scheme described in bentz et al . ( 2009a ) , we estimated the host galaxy contribution to the observed agn flux at 5100 using archival _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) images that are available for all our targets . in a case of more than one",
    "_ hst _ observation , we chose those images with the longest exposure times in the optical band .",
    "the procedure used here is quite standard and its main features are summarized here for clarity .",
    "we retrieve from the archive the calibrated data that were reduced by the latest version of the pipeline , and the best reference files .",
    "all of the exposures for a single object are combined with _ astrodrizzle _",
    "v1.0.2 task in the _ drizzlepac _ package to clean cosmic rays and make one distortion - corrected image of the host galaxy .",
    "only the pixels flagged as good in the data quality frames are included in the combined images .",
    "some exposures include saturated pixels .",
    "these were removed prior to the final combination of all data .",
    "thus , all pixels marked with zeros in weighting _ astrodrizzle _ output , ( i.e. , no good pixel from any exposure ) are masked out in the following fitting processes .",
    "examples of the final combined distortion - free images are shown in the left panels of figure 1 with spectroscopic monitoring apertures overlaid .",
    "the diagram confirms that galaxy contribution to the observed fluxes at 5100  is non - negligible in all three cases .",
    "we use galfit v3.0 ( peng et al . 2002 ; 2010 ) to model the surface brightness distribution of the three host galaxies .",
    "the galfit algorithm fits two dimensional analytic functions to galaxies and point sources .",
    "each of the objects in this study is fitted with a point - spread function ( psf ) to model the agn , one to several srsic profiles to model the host galaxy , and a constant to model the sky background .",
    "psfs were generated for each agn by creating a distorted psf model at its detector position in each of the exposed frames using tinytim package ( krist 1993 ) and combining these models by _ astrodrizzle _ using the same configuration that was used to combine the agn images .",

    "we set no constraint on @xmath109 when fitting bulge , bar or elliptical host , but fix @xmath111 to model the disk component .",
    "at least one srsic component was required to model the galaxy in addition to the psf and sky components , and more were added if needed . for some cases where the psf modeled by tinytim does not match the nuclear surface brightness distribution well ( see krist 2003 ; kim et al .",
    "2008 ) , an additional srsic component with small effective radius was used to modify the mismatch .",
    "when the field of view ( fov ) of the _ hst _ instrument [ e.g. , high resolution channel ( hrc ) of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) ] is small , the area in the edge of the image used to constrain the fitted sky value was limited .",
    "we carefully adjusted the initial parameters to make sure the residuals and @xmath113 were minimized .",
    "other bright objects in the fov of our targets were masked out .",
    "having completed the host galaxy modeling , we subtracted the psf and sky components from the images of each object and extracted from the psf - sky - free images the total counts due to the host galaxy inside the slit of the spectrograph .",
    "these counts were transformed to flux density units . because of the difference between the pivot wavelength of the _ hst _ filter and the rest - frame 5100",
    ", we used a bulge template spectrum ( kinney et al . 1996 ) to determine the required color correction .",
    "the template is redshifted and reddened by galactic extinction based on the dust extinction map of schlafly & finkbeiner ( 2011 ) .",
    "the _ synphot _",
    "package is then employed to convolve the _ hst _ passband with the template to simulate the photometry .",
    "normalizing the counts to the observed total counts in the aperture provides the host galaxy flux at 5100 .",

    "finally we obtained the intrinsic fwhm(broad h@xmath0 ) by allowing for the instrumental broadening .",
    "the fwhms and their uncertainties are listed in table 5",
    ".    regarding the preferred velocity measure , there are two options : @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( see  1 for definitions and references ) .",
    "the mean values for both are obtained through a comparison with the @xmath129 relationship in non - active galaxies .",
    "the most recent results based on 25 agns with reliably measured @xmath16 are those of woo et al ( 2013 ) who obtained @xmath130 , depending on the exact method used .",
    "the uncertainty on these numbers are about @xmath131 .",
    "netzer and marziani ( 2010 ) used the @xmath12-based method and the somewhat inferior samples of onken et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and of woo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) to obtain @xmath132 .",
    "this is confirmed by the more recent results of woo ( 2013 , private communication ) that provides @xmath133 for the above sample of 25 agns .",
    "the results of this work is @xmath134 , i.e. similar to the scatter of @xmath135 ) .",
    "since for a gaussian line profile @xmath136 , the two methods are basically identical given the uncertainties .",
    "the rms spectra over the region of the h@xmath0 line are shown in figure 5 where they are compared with the same parts of the mean spectra .",
    "the quality of the rms spectra depends on the seeing and the position of the target in the slit .",
    "the spectra tend to be noisy in particular in cases of small variability amplitude .",
    "strong residuals may be present depending on the exact positioning of the slit and the accuracy of the wavelength calibration . in the cases studied here , this is most noticeable for the @xmath1375007 line , the strongest narrow feature in the spectrum , where the residual noise , at a level of about 3% of the line intensity , is clearly visible .",
    "this phenomenon is well known from earlier reverberation mapping campaigns ( e.g. figures 1 - 3 in peterson et al .",
    "1998 , kaspi et al .",
    "2000 , park et al .",
    "we have also checked the measured fluxes of the @xmath1375007 lines in all spectra and found that they fluctuated in a random way , uncorrelated with the continuum variations , by 3% , 4% and 4% for mrk 335 , mrk 142 and iras f12397 , respectively .",
    "we measured fwhm(h@xmath0 ) from the rms spectra after smoothing the profiles with a nine pixels boxcar filter . the uncertainty on the width",
    "was estimated by repeating the procedure with a 3-pixel boxcar filter that resulted in a narrower profile .",
    "these measurements resulted in fwhms of @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 , for mrk 335 , mrk 142 and iras f12397 + 3333 , respectively .",
    "the uncertainties derived in this way are only due to the noisy rms profiles . the comparison with the fwhms measured from the mean spectra suggests a somewhat narrower rms profile for mrk 335 , and similar witdthes , within the uncertainties , for the other two objects .    in this work",
    "we adopt the combination of the @xmath12 method and the mean spectrum for several reasons : first , the measurement of @xmath12 , given our spectral resolution , is less uncertain than @xmath13 .",
    "second , nls1s tend to have lorentzian - shaped line profiles that can result in a considerable increase of @xmath13 which is very sensitive to the accuracy of the very extended wings measurement .",
    "finally , in many cases the combination of the rms spectrum and @xmath13 gives similar bh mass to the combination of @xmath12 and the mean spectrum ( kaspi et al .",
    "this is not surprising given that the scaling factor @xmath9 is an average over a large number of blrs , with different radial gas distributions and inclinations to the lines of sight , some described better by @xmath12 and some by @xmath13 .",
    "regardless of the exact method , the only secure way to obtain the correct mass and its normalization is by calibrating the entire sample against the @xmath129 relationship .",
    "the results of the three bh mass measurements are listed in table 5 with their associated uncertainties . we also list lower limits on eddington ratios that were computed by adopting the most conservative estimate on the radiation efficiency ( see discussion below ) .",
    "all three sources are super - eddington accretors .",
    "mrk 335 is a well - known nls1 .",
    "it has been monitored for 6 years by kassebaum et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and re - analyzed by zu et al .",
    "the x - ray observations show large variations at soft and hard x - ray energies ( arvalo et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the optical monitoring shows variability at a level of 10% ( peterson et al .",
    "1998 ) . figure [ mrk335 ] shows the line and continuum light curves obtained by us with variability amplitudes of @xmath141 in both .",
    "the measured lag , @xmath1 days , is similar to the previous measurements that range from 12.5 to 16.8 days ( see table 6 for details and references ) .",
    "this lag is still in reasonable agreement with the bentz et al .",
    "( 2013 ) expression for the @xmath18 relationship .",
    "the virial mass of the black hole measured by us is @xmath142 and the eddington ratios @xmath143 , large enough to indicate a seambh .",
    "the more conservative approach assuming @xmath66 , gives @xmath144 which is also beyond the ss regime of thin ads ( laor & netzer 1989 ) .",
    "comparison with previous rm experiments for this source , listed in table 6 , suggest that the present response of the blr is shorter than in all previous campaigns although the deviation is still consistent with the estimated uncertainties .",
    "we suggest that the size of the blr in this source changed significantly , over a period of about 10 years since the earlier rm measurements .",
    "the corresponding change in the 5100  luminosity is smaller .",
    "this interesting possibility requires more data to instigate in detail .",
    "this object was mapped by the lamp project ( bentz et al .",
    "2009b ) who reported a time lag of @xmath145 days measured from the peak correlation coefficient ( @xmath146 ) .",
    "the significance of this measurement was the lowest among all sources monitored in that project .",
    "the reason was the lack of a clear peak in the  light curve .",
    "figure [ mrk142 ] shows the light curves of mrk 142 obtained by the slt .",
    "our observations are superior to the measurements of bentz et al .",
    "( 2009b ) for several reasons : the sampling is more homogeneous , the error bars are smaller , and the light curves exhibit two clear minima and maxima . the ccf shows a very sharp peak around @xmath147 days with a correlation coefficient of @xmath148 .",
    "our measured lag is larger than the previously measured value by more than a factor 2 which brings the source closer to the @xmath18 relationship of bentz et al .",
    "( 2013 ) . however , the object is still a clear outlier of the relationship .    according to eqn .",
    "3 and table 4 , the value of @xmath65 derived for mrk 142 is at least 2.3 ( @xmath66 ) and more likely around 5.9 ( @xmath149 ) .",
    "this is at the high end of the @xmath65 distribution of all agns with reliable rm - based bh mass measurements .",
    "as alluded to earlier , such accretion rates are inconsistent with the thin disk idea and we expect that the real accretion rate , @xmath33 , is even larger making mrk 142 a clear case of a seambh .",
    "iras f12397 + 3333 is an infrared luminous source identified as an agn by keel et al .",
    "the optical sed of the source is `` red '' compared with most agns , including those in the rm sample .",
    "this is typical of other iras sources .",
    "the hypothesis of significant dust attenuation is supported by polarization measurements ( grupe et al .",
    "1998 ) and by the weak signal obtained by _ galex _ at @xmath150  ( atlee & mathur 2009 ) which",
    ", when combined with our own measurements , gives @xmath151 , far above what is observed in unreddened agns , like those in the sdss sample ( note that these are not contemporaneous observations ) .    to further check this point",
    ", we fitted the sdss spectrum of the source and decomposed the h@xmath152 and h@xmath0 lines into narrow and broad components slit is @xmath153 , which is too low to separate the narrow and broad components .",
    "this is the reason for using the higher resolution sdss spectrum . ] .",
    "we found fwhms of 380 and 1680 , for the narrow and broad components , respectively .",
    "this results in @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "this steep balmer decrement suggests that reddening significantly affects the narrow emission lines and possibly also the broad emission lines .",
    "finally , the x - ray spectrum of the source shows strong and broad k@xmath152 line emission at around 6.4 kev ( bianchi et al . 2009 ; zhou & zhang 2010 ) but the hydrogen column density is low , @xmath156 ( grupe et al . 2001 ) .",
    "assuming galactic dust - to - gas ratio , this corresponds to @xmath157 .",
    "given the likely continuum extinction , and the conflicting results obtained from the x - ray column density and the _ galex _ results , we considered two different possibilities regarding the reddening .",
    "the first is no attenuation but extreme value of @xmath158 in the blr and the second is dust extinction with an intrinsic balmer decrement of @xmath159 , a ratio typical of a large number of `` blue '' agns with no suspected continuum attenuation ( e.g. , vanden berk et al . 2001 ) .",
    "balmer decrements in this range are fairly typical and are consistent with the conditions expected in the blr ( netzer 2013 ) .",
    "assuming first no reddening , we get @xmath160 . using eqn . 3 and our measured bh mass ( @xmath161 ) we get @xmath162 .",
    "in the second case , @xmath163 which results in @xmath164 .",
    "the corresponding values for @xmath66 are 0.5 and 4.6 .",
    "all values are above or close the limiting case of @xmath165 and the ones corrected for reddening are the largest among all cases published so far in agns with directly measured bh mass . comparing eddington ratio estimations in other samples of nls1s with estimates based on the virial method ,",
    "e.g. the one shown in figure 4 of wang & netzer 2003 , we find that iras f12397 + 3333 and mrk 142 have the highest eddington ratios measured so far .",
    "as argued in numerous publications ( e.g. , kelly et al . 2011 and references therein ) , understanding agn variability is key to the understanding of the accretion mechanism , including the ad properties ( liu et al . 2008 ) .",
    "thus , the results of our monitoring campaign shed new light on several aspects of nls1s in general and seambhs in particular .",
    "first , we detected significant line and continuum variations , @xmath141 , in three fast accreting black holes .",
    "such variations have not been detected in most other known cases of nls1s .",
    "the variations can provide important constraints on the properties of slim accretion disks ( mineshige et al 2000 ) , a topic that we are currently investigating .",
    "second , all three objects are accreting close to or above the limit of @xmath166 even under the most conservative estimate of @xmath66 .",
    "two of the sources , mrk 142 and iras f12397 + 3333 , show the highest values of @xmath65 measured so far .",
    "they indicate physical conditions that are far outside the nominal conditions for thin ss type disks . among reverberation - mapped agns ,",
    "these are perhaps the best candidates for having slim accretion disks .",
    "third , the newly measured lag for mrk335 is smaller than the earlier measurements but still in reasonable agreement with the @xmath18 relation obtained by bentz et al .",
    "this is not the case for mrk142 , and for iras f12397 + 3333 assuming there is extinction along the line of sight to this source .",
    "both these objects fall well below the above correlation .",
    "this leads to a suggestion that seambhs may exhibit a somewhat different @xmath18 relationship .",
    "one possibility is that in such cases , the very different geometry of the slim disk results in a different radiation pattern . in particular , the face - on luminosity can be very large compared with the equatorial value leading to the possibility that equatorial blr gas clouds are exposed to much weaker radiation than assumed in isotropic radiation fields , which affect their location .",
    "such ideas have been around for some time ( netzer 1987 ; korista , ferland & baldwin 1997 ; netzer 2013 ) but have never been studied in relation to slim disks . in addition , the balance between gravity and radiation pressure force , which is proportional to @xmath33 , may affect blr gas around slim disks in seambhs more than in other agns .",
    "this can lead to marginally bound , or perhaps even unbound cloud systems ( see discussion of these ideas in marconi et al . 2008 and netzer and marziani 2010 ) .",
    "if correct , the bh mass determination in such sources may be less secure .",
    "on the other hand , 7 of the sources with measured @xmath16 studied by woo et al ( 2013 ) are nls1s and their virial - based bh mass is in reasonable agreement with the mass obtained by the @xmath129 relationship .",
    "unfortunately none of the three sources studied here is included in the woo et al .",
    "( 2013 ) sample .",
    "fourth , the normalized accretion rates obtained here , at least for two of the cases , are so large that they must be important to the general issue of bh growth and bh duty cycle . in particular , in the exponential growth scenario , the growth time of massive bhs is inversely proportional to @xmath33 .",
    "typical continuous growth times for local active bhs , based on typical eddington rates of such sources ( @xmath167 ) , are of order the salpeter time , @xmath168 yr ( e.g. , netzer & trakhtenbrot 2007 ) . for the objects considered here , the growth time could be an order of magnitude or much shorter ( see netzer and trakhtenbrot 2013 for similar considerations regarding growth times of sdss agns ) .",
    "finally , the direct measurements of seambh masses will allow us to estimate the cosmological distance to such objects using the relationship between the bh mass and the saturated luminosity of such objects ( wang et al .",
    "this can provide a new way to measure cosmological distances up to very high redshifts .",
    "we are extending the monitoring project to larger numbers and to higher redshifts in order to provide more precise calibration of this method .",
    "we introduced the first results from a new project aimed at measuring accurate masses in agns hosting the fastest accreting active bhs .",
    "the first stage of the project includes 10 targets that were monitored with the shangri - la telescope at the lijiang station of the yunnan observatory .",
    "the results pertain to three nls1s for which we obtained detailed light curves and meaningful ccfs that can be used to derive accurate time lags and reliable bh masses .",
    "we find h@xmath0 time lags of @xmath169 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 days for mrk 335 , mrk 142 and iras f12397 , respectively .",
    "for mrk 142 and iras f12397 ( assuming its continuum is extincted ) , the lags are shorter than expected from the most recent @xmath18 relationships for the general agn population .",
    "the corresponding bh masses are @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 and the corresponding eddington ratios ( @xmath65 ) 1.6 , 5.9 and 12.1 ( extincted ) or 1.3 ( unextincted ) .",
    "all these values assume @xmath172 .",
    "values of @xmath173 as high as those measured for mrk 142 and iras f12397 have never been directly measured in other agns .",
    "all three bhs are undergoing super - eddington accretion with important consequences to the bh accretion mechanism , bh growth rate and , perhaps , cosmology .",
