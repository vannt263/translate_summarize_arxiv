    "these properties are consistent with the presence of hot and cold circumstellar dust and gas .",
    "while there is still some debate about the morphology of this circumstellar material , most evidence supports the hypothesis that in many cases the dust and gas lies in a massive ( @xmath4 m@xmath3 ) circumstellar disk ( natta , grinin , & mannings 2000 ; hillenbrand et al .",
    "1992 , hereafter hsvk ) .",
    "the strongest evidence for circumstellar disks around haebe stars comes from direct imaging with millimeter interferometry .",
    "flattened structures around several sources have been resolved on @xmath5 au scales @xcite , and detailed kinematic modeling of one source , mwc 480 , shows that the observations are fit well by a rotating keplerian disk @xcite . for a spherical distribution , these and other observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) imply extinctions at visible and infra - red wavelengths much higher than actually observed .",
    "in addition , in recent h@xmath6 spectropolarimetric observations of haebe sources ( which trace dust on scales of tens of stellar radii ) , vink et al .",
    "( 2003 ) find signatures of flattened circumstellar structures around 83% of their sample , and evidence for rotation around 9 hae stars .",
    "furthermore , the forbidden emission lines that arise in winds and outflows around haebe sources typically show blue - shifted emission but lack redshifted emission , which suggests that the redshifted component of the outflow is occluded by a circumstellar disk .",
    "the broad linewidths of low - velocity features are consistent with this emission arising in rotating circumstellar disk winds @xcite .",
    "the distribution of circumstellar material around haebes can also be inferred from modeling of spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .",
    "three distinct morphologies were identified in this way by hsvk , who classified observed haebe sources into three groups , i , ii , and iii .",
    "all sources in our observed sample fall into group i , which has seds of the form @xmath7 . these can be modeled well by flat , irradiated , accretion disks with inner holes on the order of @xmath8 stellar radii .",
    "recent sed modeling of a sample of fourteen isolated haebe stars with the characteristics of group i sources is consistent with emission from a passive reprocessing disk @xcite . moreover , meeus et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ( and other investigators , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) attribute this emission to the outer part of a flared circumstellar disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while previous authors attributed blackbody components observed in seds of haebe sources to tenuous envelopes @xcite . size scales and orientations of disks around haebe stars can only be determined directly through high angular resolution imaging .",
    "the spatial and velocity structure of cooler outer haebe disks on @xmath5 au scales has been mapped with millimeter - wave interferometers ( as discussed above ) . to probe the warmer inner regions of the disk ( @xmath9 au scales ) , measurements with near - ir interferometers are necessary .",
    "the only near - ir interferometric observations of haebe sources to date , conducted with the iota interferometer ( millan - gabet et al .",
    "1999 ; millan - gabet , schloerb , & traub 2001 , hereafter mst ) , led to sizes and orientations of sources largely inconsistent with values estimated using other techniques .",
    "a geometrically flat disk may be too simplistic to accommodate all the observations , and puffed up inner disk walls ( dullemond , dominik , & natta 2001 ; hereafter ddn ) or flared outer disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may need to be included in the models .",
    "however , the limited number of haebe sources observed with near - ir interferometers and the sparse @xmath10 coverage of these observations @xcite make it difficult to draw unambiguous conclusions about the structure of the circumstellar material .",
    "we have begun a program with the palomar testbed interferometer ( pti ) to observe haebe stars . by increasing the sample size and improving @xmath10 coverage",
    ", we aim to understand better the structure of the circumstellar emission on @xmath9 au scales . in this paper",
    ", we present results for five sources , ab aur , vv ser , v1685 cyg ( bd+40@xmath04124 ) , as 442 , and mwc 1080 .",
    "we note that neither our list of haebes , nor that of mst , represents an unbiased sample , but rather , is limited to those stars that are bright enough ( @xmath11 ) to be successfully observed .",
    "we model the structure of circumstellar dust around haebe stars using these pti data , together with iota measurements where available .",
    "specifically , we compare various models  gaussians , uniform disks , uniform rings , and accretion disks with inner holes  to the visibility data to determine approximate size scales and orientations of the circumstellar emission . in  [ sec : obs ] , we describe the pti observations . in  [ sec : res ] , we fit the observed data to several different models for the circumstellar dust distribution and derive angular sizes and orientations .",
    "implications of the modeling and comparisons with previous observations are discussed in  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "the palomar testbed interferometer ( pti ) is a long - baseline near - ir michelson interferometer located on palomar mountain near san diego , ca @xcite .",
    "pti combines starlight from two 40-cm aperture telescopes using a michelson beam combiner , and records the resulting fringe visibilities .",
    "these fringe visibilities are related to the source brightness distribution via the van cittert - zernike theorem , which states that the visibility distribution in @xmath10 space and the brightness distribution on the sky are fourier transform pairs @xcite .",
    "we observed five haebe sources , ab aur , vv ser , v1685 cyg ( bd+40@xmath04124 ) , as 442 , and mwc 1080 , with pti between may and october of 2002 .",
    "properties of the sample are included in table [ tab : sources ] .",
    "we obtained k - band ( 2.2 @xmath1 m ) measurements on an 85-m north - west ( nw ) baseline for all five objects , and on a 110-m north - south ( ns ) baseline for three . the nw baseline is oriented @xmath12 west of north and has a fringe spacing of @xmath13 mas , and the ns baseline is @xmath14 west of north and has a fringe spacing of @xmath15 mas . a summary of the observations is given in table [ tab : obs ] .",
    "pti measures fringes in two channels , corresponding to the two outputs from the beam combiner .",
    "one output is spatially filtered with an optical fiber and dispersed onto five `` spectral '' pixels , while the other output is focused onto a single `` white - light '' pixel ( without spatial filtering ) .",
    "the white - light pixel is used principally for fringe - tracking : the fringe phase is measured and then used to control the delay line system to track atmospheric fringe motion ( and thus maintain zero optical path difference between the two interfering beams ) .",
    "the spectral pixels are generally used to make accurate measurements of the squared visibility amplitudes ( @xmath16 ) of observed sources .",
    "we sample the data at either 20 or 50 milliseconds in order to make measurements on a timescale shorter than the atmospheric coherence time .",
    "a `` scan '' , which is the unit of data we will use in the analysis below , consists of 130 seconds of data , divided into five equal time blocks .",
    "the @xmath16 is calculated for each of these blocks using an incoherent average of the constituent 20 or 50-ms measurements from a synthetic wide - band channel formed from the five spectral pixels @xcite .",
    "@xmath16 for the entire scan is given by the mean of these five estimates , and the statistical uncertainty is given by the standard deviation from the mean value .",
    "we calibrate the measured @xmath16 for the observed haebe sources by comparing them to visibilities measured for calibrator sources of known angular sizes , for which we can easily calculate the expected @xmath16 for an ideal system .",
    "the visibilities are normalized such that @xmath17 for a point source observed with an ideal system .",
    "we calculate the expected @xmath16 by assuming that the calibrators are uniform stellar disks . making use of the van cittert - zernike theorem ,",
    "the squared visibilities for these sources are given by @xmath18 here , @xmath19 is the first - order bessel function .",
    "@xmath20 is the angular diameter of the star , and @xmath21 is the `` uv radius '' , defined by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the baseline vector , @xmath24 is a unit vector pointing from the center of the baseline towards the source , and @xmath25 is the observing wavelength .",
    "( the qualitative explanation of equation [ eq : ud ] is that while for unresolved sources the visibility is constant with increasing uv radius , for progressively larger sources the visibility decreases faster with increasing uv radius . ) by comparing @xmath26 to the measured @xmath16 for a calibrator , we derive the `` system visibility '' , which represents the point source response of the interferometer : @xmath27 this system visibility , in turn , is used to calibrate the squared visibilities for the target source : @xmath28 specifically , we determine @xmath29 at the time of each target scan , using an average of @xmath30 weighted by the proximity of the target and calibrator in both time and angle . for further discussion of the calibration procedure , see boden et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "calibrators must be close to the target sources ( on the sky an in time ) so that the atmospheric effects will be the same for both .",
    "they should also be of small angular size , @xmath20 , so that @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and the calibration is thus less sensitive to uncertainties in the assumed calibrator diameter .",
    "the angular size of a calibrator can be estimated from the published stellar luminosity and distance , from a blackbody fit to published photometric data with the temperature constrained to that expected for the published spectral type , or from an unconstrained blackbody fit to the photometric data .",
    "we adopt the average of these three size estimates in our analysis , and the uncertainty is given by the spread of these values .",
    "relevant properties of the calibrators used in these observations are given in table [ tab : cals ] .",
    "we measured calibrated squared visibilities for ab aur , vv ser , v1685 cyg , as 442 , and mwc 1080 ( table [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "all five sources are resolved by pti ( i.e. , @xmath16 is significantly different from unity ) , implying angular sizes @xmath33 mas . the data are consistent with disk - like morphologies for all sources , and we can place good constraints on disk inclinations for most sources .",
    "mwc 1080 , v1685 cyg , and vv ser show evidence for significantly non - zero inclinations , while a circularly symmetric distribution appears appropriate for ab aur .",
    "the as 442 data are insufficient to constrain the inclination .",
    "interferometric observations of ab aur and mwc 1080 at 2.2 @xmath1 m have also been obtained with the 21-m and 38-m baselines of the iota interferometer @xcite . when combined with our longer baseline pti data ( 85-m and 110-m )",
    ", these help fill in the @xmath10 plane , and enable us to improve constraints on source models ( see below ; figure [ fig : v1685cyg - model ] ) . based on discussion with r. millan - gabet",
    ", we assign an uncertainty to each iota visibility given by the standard deviation of all data obtained for a given source with a given baseline .",
    "we verify the registration of the iota and pti data using calibrators observed by both interferometers . since the iota data for ab aur was calibrated using hd 32406 , which is unresolved by both pti and iota , we can be confident of the registration .",
    "we measured the diameter of hd 220074 , the calibrator for mwc 1080 , to be @xmath34 , while mst assumed a size of @xmath35 .",
    "this difference in angular size translates into only a 0.7% effect , which is within the measurement errors ( the effect is so small because the calibrator is essentially unresolved by iota ) .",
    "nearby companions that lie outside the interferometric field of view , @xmath36 mas , but within the field of view of the detector , @xmath37 , will contribute incoherent light to the visibilities . for mwc 1080 , which has a known nearby companion @xcite",
    ", we use the correction factor @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the difference in k - band magnitudes between the two stars . for mwc 1080",
    ", we measured @xmath40 ( angular separation @xmath41 ) using the palomar adaptive optics system on the 200-inch telescope on november 18 , 2002 .",
    "v1685 cyg is also known to have a faint companion ( @xmath42 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the effect of this companion on the visibilities is negligible .",
    "adaptive optics images of the other sources in our sample show that none of these has any bright companions ( @xmath43 ) at distances between @xmath36 mas and @xmath44 .",
    "our measured visibilities contain information about emission from both the circumstellar material and the star itself .",
    "we can remove the effect of the central star on the visibilities by including it in the models : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the stellar flux , @xmath47 is the excess flux ( both measured at 2.2 @xmath1 m ) , @xmath48 is the visibility of the ( unresolved ) central star , and @xmath49 is the visibility due to the circumstellar component .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that @xmath48 , since for typical stellar radii ( @xmath13 r@xmath3 ) and distances ( @xmath50 pc ) , the angular diameters of the central stars will be @xmath51 mas . in the case of the binary model described below (  [ sec : binary ] ) , we do not perform any such correction , since the basic model already includes the stellar component .",
    "equation [ eq : vtot ] assumes that the central star is a point source , and thus contributes coherently to the visibilities .",
    "it is also possible that the starlight is actually observable only as scattered light emission , and that it will have some incoherent contribution to the visibility ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "for example , coronographic imaging with the hubble space telescope has revealed scattered light on angular scales from @xmath53@xmath54 around ab aur @xcite .",
    "a proper treatment of the effects of this scattered light on the visibilities is beyond the scope of this work , but we mention it as a possible source of uncertainty . since the near - ir excess from haebe sources typically dominates over the near - ir stellar emission (  [ sec : phot ] ; table [ tab : sources ] ) , the effect should be insignificant .",
    "@xmath46 and @xmath47 affect the visibilities ( equation [ eq : vtot ] ) , and thus it is important to determine these quantities accurately .",
    "since haebe objects are often highly variable at near - ir wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we obtained photometric k - band measurements of the sources in our sample that are nearly contemporaneous with our pti observations , using the palomar 200-inch telescope between november 14 and 18 , 2002 .",
    "calibration relied on observations of 2mass sources close in angle to the target sources , and we estimate uncertainties of @xmath55 magnitudes . our photometry is consistent with published measurements to within @xmath56 magnitudes for all objects @xcite .",
    "following hsvk and mst , we calculate @xmath46 and @xmath47 using our k - band photometry ( table [ tab : sources ] ) combined with bvri photometry , visual extinctions , and stellar effective temperatures from the literature @xcite",
    ". de - reddening uses the extinction law of steenman & th ( 1991 ) .",
    "assuming that all of the short - wavelength flux is due to the central star , we fit a blackbody at the assumed effective temperature to the de - reddened bvri data .",
    "the k - band stellar flux is derived from the value of this blackbody curve at 2.2 @xmath1 m .",
    "the excess flux is then given by the difference between the de - reddened observed flux and the stellar flux .",
    "the derived fluxes are given in table [ tab : sources ] .",
    "we note that vv ser and as 442 are optically variable by @xmath57 magnitudes on timescales of days to months ( while the other sources in our sample show little or no optical variability ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus @xmath46 is somewhat uncertain .",
    "however , since @xmath58 for these objects , this uncertainty is negligible when modeling the visibilities .      for each source ,",
    "we compare the observed visibilities to those derived from a uniform disk model , a gaussian model , a ring model , and an accretion disk model with an inner disk hole ( all models are 2-d ) .",
    "if we assume that the inclination of the circumstellar material is zero , then the one remaining free parameter in the models is the angular size scale , @xmath20 .",
    "when we include inclination effects , we fit for three parameters : size ( @xmath20 ) , inclination angle ( @xmath59 ) , and position angle ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "inclination is defined such that a face - on disk has @xmath61 , and @xmath60 is measured east of north . following mst ,",
    "we include @xmath59 and @xmath60 in our models of the brightness distribution via a simple coordinate transformation : @xmath62 here , @xmath63 are the coordinates on the sky , and @xmath64 are the transformed coordinates",
    ". the effect of this coordinate transformation on the visibilities will be to transform @xmath65 to @xmath66 : @xmath67 substitution of @xmath64 for @xmath63 , and @xmath66 for @xmath65 in the expressions below yield models with inclination effects included .",
    "in addition to these four models , we also examine whether the data are consistent with a wide binary model , which we approximate with two stationary point sources . for this model ,",
    "the free parameters are the angular separation ( @xmath20 ) , the position angle ( @xmath60 ) , and the brightness ratio of the two components ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "the brightness distribution for a normalized gaussian model is given by @xmath69 and the ( normalized ) visibilities expected for this observed brightness distribution are calculated via a fourier transform to be , @xmath70 here , @xmath63 are the angular offsets from the central star , @xmath20 is the angular fwhm of the brightness distribution , and @xmath71 is the `` uv radius '' ( equation [ eq : ruv ] ) . the model for the observed squared visibilities",
    "is obtained by using equation [ eq : vtot ] with @xmath72 .      the brightness distribution for a uniform disk is simply given by a 2-d top - hat function .",

    "nevertheless , we can make an approximate determination of the size scale , although we can not distinguish between inclined disk , face - on disk , or binary models ( figures [ fig : as442-uv ] and [ fig : as442-ha ] ) .",
    "the size scales for various disk models range from 0.9 to 2.7 mas ( table [ tab : as442 ] ) .",
    "the pti and iota observations for mwc 1080 are completely incompatible with face - on models ( @xmath128 ) , and significantly non - zero inclinations are required to fit the data well ( figures [ fig : mwc1080-uv ] and [ fig : mwc1080-ha ] ) .",

    "as discussed in  [ sec : intro ] , there is currently a wide variety of evidence that supports the existence of circumstellar disks around many haebe stars .",
    "our new pti results strengthen this contention .",
    "resolved , small - scale ( @xmath9 au ) distributions of dust are found in all observed sources , and the non - symmetric intensity distributions of best - fit models for most objects provide support for inclined disk geometries .",
    "we suggest that the material around vv ser , v1685 cyg , and mwc 1080 is significantly inclined , and we can not rule out a high inclination angle for as 442 .",
    "this hypothesis is compatible with observed optical variability in vv ser and as 442 , which has been attributed to variable obscuration from clumps of dust orbiting in inclined circumstellar disks .",
    "the ab aur data , in contrast , are consistent with a circumstellar distribution that is within @xmath132 of face - on .",
    "this agrees well with mst and is compatible with modeling of scattered light observed with the hubble space telescope , which suggests an inclination angle @xmath133 @xcite .",
    "the small amplitude of variability in ab aur ( @xmath134 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is also consistent with this low inclination angle ( under the assumption that variability is caused by time - dependent circumstellar obscuration ) .",
    "the low inclination angle does _ not _ , however , agree with mm - wave imaging in the @xmath135co(1 - 0 ) line , which yields an estimated inclination of @xmath136 for the ab aur disk @xcite .",
    "the angular sizes determined from our observations are generally in good agreement with the non - inclined ( @xmath61 ) flat accretion disk models of hsvk for early - type herbig be stars , v1685 cyg and mwc 1080 , but not for the later - type stars , ab aur , vv ser , and as 442 ( the spectral type for vv ser , a0 , is uncertain by @xmath137 spectral subclasses ; mora et al .",
    "angular sizes derived from the earlier iota observations ( mst ) were often an order of magnitude larger than those predicted by the hsvk models , and on this basis mst ruled these models out .",
    "hsvk determined the best - fit models for the seds of haebe sources by assuming a face - on disk geometry , adjusting the accretion rate to match the mid - ir flux , and then adjusting the size of the inner hole to match the near - ir flux .",
    "we compare our results with theirs in a qualitative way by plotting the visibilities predicted by the hsvk models along with the observed pti and iota visibilities in figures [ fig : abaur - uv ] , [ fig : vvser - uv ] , [ fig : v1685cyg - uv ] , [ fig : as442-uv ] , and [ fig : mwc1080-uv ] . for a more quantitative comparison , we use published luminosities , effective temperatures , and accretion rates @xcite to calculate the inner radii predicted by flat accretion disk models with @xmath138 k ( equations [ eq : t1au ] and [ eq : trin ] ) , and compare these estimates to our interferometric results ( which were also derived assuming @xmath138 k ;  [ sec : acc ] ) . in table",

    "no estimate of @xmath143 is available for as 442 .",
    "our data for the later - type stars ab aur , vv ser , and as 442 are fairly consistent with the puffed up inner disk models of ddn , assuming inner disk temperatures @xmath144 k. in contrast , puffed up inner disk models are completely incompatible with the pti results for the very early - type stars in our sample , v1685 cyg and mwc 1080 .",
    "the radius of the inner wall , @xmath79 , predicted by ddn is , @xmath145 where , @xmath146 is the ( published ) stellar luminosity , @xmath81 is the temperature of the inner wall , and @xmath147 is the ratio of the width of the inner wall to its radius . based on ddn , we assume @xmath148 for stars earlier than spectral type b6 , and @xmath103 for later - type stars . we calculate @xmath79 for @xmath149 k ( likely sublimation temperatures for silicate and graphite dust grains , respectively ) , and compare these to the ring diameters derived from fitting to near - ir interferometric visibilities . in table [ tab : ring ] , @xmath139 and @xmath140 represent the inner radii determined for face - on and inclined ring models , respectively (  [ sec : ring ] ) , and @xmath150 , @xmath151 are the inner radii predicted by the ddn puffed - up inner disk models , assuming sublimation temperatures of 2000 and 1500 k , respectively .",
    "we note that the comparison of our interferometric results to physical models should be independent of the assumed distance ( see appendix [ sec : dist ] ) .",
    "the inner radius is @xmath152 in both the ddn and hsvk models , and the linear sizes determined from our interferometric results ( converted from modeled angular sizes ) are also @xmath153 , and thus , the comparison is independent of @xmath88 .",
    "flat accretion disk models @xcite are generally in good agreement with the observed visibility data for early - type b - stars , while puffed up inner disk models ( ddn ) seem more consistent for later - type stars .",
    "we speculate that this could be due to different accretion mechanisms in earlier and later - type stars .",
    "a similar idea has been put forward based on the results of h@xmath6 spectropolarimetry , where differences in the observations for early - type hbe stars and later - type hae stars have been attributed to a transition from disk accretion in higher - mass stars to magnetic accretion in lower - mass stars @xcite .",
    "there is always the possibility that the visibilities for some of the observed haebe sources may be ( partially ) due to close companions . for ab aur and mwc 1080 , we can rule out binary models ( with separations @xmath33 mas ) with a high degree of confidence .",
    "however , mwc 1080 is an eclipsing binary with a period of @xmath154 days @xcite .",
    "the separation is much too small to be detected by pti , and the observed visibilities for this source are thus probably due to an inclined circum-_binary _ disk .",
    "observations over a time - span of @xmath5 days ( table [ tab : obs ] ) , with visibilities that are fairly constant in time ( figures [ fig : v1685cyg - uv ] and [ fig : v1685cyg - ha ] ) provide some evidence against v1685 cyg being a binary . as",
    "yet , the binarity status of as 442 and vv ser remain uncertain based on our visibility data , although radial velocity variations of spectral lines in as 442 have been attributed to a binary with @xmath155 days and @xmath156 @xcite .",
    "we observed the haebe sources ab aur , vv ser , v1685 cyg ( bd+40@xmath04124 ) , as 442 , and mwc 1080 at 2.2 @xmath1 m with the palomar testbed interferometer .",
    "these are only the second published near - ir interferometric observations of haebe stars . from these high angular resolution data",
    ", we determined the angular size scales and orientations predicted by uniform disk , gaussian , ring , and accretion disk models , and we examined whether the data were consistent with binary models .",
    "ab aur appears to be surrounded by a disk that is inclined by @xmath118 , while vv ser , v1685 cyg , and mwc 1080 are associated with more highly inclined circumstellar disks . with the available data",
    ", we can not distinguish between different radial distributions , such as gaussians , uniform disks , rings , or accretion disks .    while the angular size scales determined in this work are generally consistent with the only other near - ir interferometric measurements of haebe stars by mst , our measurements are the first that show evidence for significantly inclined morphologies .",
    "moreover , the derived angular sizes for early type herbig be stars in our sample , v1685 cyg and mwc 1080 , agree fairly well with those predicted by face - on accretion disk models used by hsvk to explain observed spectral energy distributions .",
