    "a key quantity is the specific heat @xmath20 , for which @xmath24 @xmath25 is the reduced temperature , the index @xmath26 is defined by the critical behavior of @xmath21 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is a subtraction constant due to additive renormalization  @xcite .",

    "in particular @xmath3 and @xmath40 scaling predicts no singular behavior in the @xmath49 limit for the specific heat as @xmath30 is negative .",
    "also for @xmath48 the predicted exponents fail to reproduce lattice data . in the whole study",
    "a non - improved action was used .",
    "one could then wonder whether this disagreement is a consequence of a poor convergence to the continuum limit .",
    "however it seems unlikely that an infrared qualitative feature of the theory , like the growth of the specific heat , can heavily rely on improvement of the action .    wishing to test scaling behaviors other than the two previously considered , namely first order and mean field , we considered the scaling relations eqs .",

    "smaller lattices and larger masses were discarded for this analysis in order to satisfy the constrains of above equations and an additional set of simulations with @xmath51 and @xmath52 was added .",

    "although the upper mass limit of validity of eqs .  [ cv2]-[chi2 ] is not known _ a priori _ , it should be noted that restricting the mass range of the fit worsen the agreement with @xmath3 , @xmath40 and mf hypotheses while for first order it remains unchanged .",
    "the scaling of susceptibilities at all @xmath55 can also be investigated .",
    "[ shchisca ] shows the quality of the scaling for the two different working assumptions of @xmath3 and @xmath54 order both for the specific heat and @xmath48 .",
    "even if it is difficult to make precise quantitative statements about the quality of these scalings , the first order case seems to give better results for both of the susceptibilities considered .",
    "this is clearly the case for the height of the susceptibilities as shown above , but it is also true for the width of these curves .",
    "the horizontal scale of these plots is given by the scaling variable @xmath56 where @xmath38 , the reduced temperature , depends on the unkwon value of @xmath57 ( see eq .  [ redt ] ) .",

    "having detected a signal of a first order phase transition , it is natural to look at time histories of observables to find signals of metastabilities .",
    "such metastabilities should manistifest themselves as double peaks structures in the histograms of observable distributions .",
    "indeed we found such structures for some of our time histories at largest volumes and smallest masses , as shown in fig .",
    "[ hist ] . even though this is a preliminary indication of a first order phase transition it is not conclusive and we were not able to evidence this double peak structure consistently , in particular in the data taken at @xmath58 with @xmath59 , where it was expected to be present .",

    "a large numerical effort has been done with the aim of clarifing the nature of the chiral transition .",
    "our mc simulations were run on @xmath60 machines with a total computation cost of about 5  @xmath61 .",
    "the hypothesis of a second order phase transition belonging to the universality class of @xmath3 or @xmath40 has been carefully tested on the lattice by looking at the finite size scaling of the basic thermodynamic susceptibilities , first of all the specific heat and then the chiral condensate susceptibility . to do that",
    ", we have fixed the scaling variable @xmath62 in eqs .",
    "[ cv1]-[chi1 ] and we have studied the residual @xmath42 dependence .",
    "our results , presented in the first part of sect",
    ".  [ numresult ] , seem to exclude both the @xmath3 and @xmath40 universality classes .",
    "in particular , the growth of the specific heat going towards small masses and large volumes is in constrast with the expected behavior of a @xmath3 or @xmath40 transition in which there should be no singular contribution to @xmath20 .",
    "the finite size scaling of the chiral condensate susceptibility is also incompatible with @xmath3 and @xmath40 universality class .",
    "an extented analysis at small masses , presented at the end of sect .",
    "[ numresult ] , clearly shows that a first order phase transition is instead consistent with lattice data while all other open choises are disfavored .",
    "together with the scaling of the specific heat and order parameter susceptibility , also the time hystories of observables show some signals of metastabilities , i.e. double peak structures in distributions , which , although not conclusive , are a qualitative indication of a first order phase transition .    we have used the standard staggered action and @xmath63 .",
    "we plan to repeat the analysis with larger @xmath64 and improved action .",
    "however the growth of the peaks which excludes @xmath3 and @xmath40 is a typical infrared phenomenon , most likely independent on short range improvements .",
    "we also plan to run keeping the scaling variable @xmath62 constant under the assumption of a first order transition , to check directly if it is consistent .",
    "the indication  @xcite coming from the dual superconductivity disorder parameter is also in the direction of a first order phase transition .",
