    "the e791 collaboration found a strong evidence for a light and broad scalar - isoscalar resonance in @xmath4 decays , known as the @xmath5 ( or @xmath6 ) meson  @xcite . according to their fit ,",
    "this resonance contributes to approximately half of the decays and has a mass and width given by @xmath7 mev and @xmath8  mev .",
    "this presence of the @xmath5 in @xmath2 has been confirmed by the cleo collaboration in a very recent paper  @xcite and the results they obtained are in agreement with those of e791 . on the other hand , this resonance was for a long time hidden in scattering experiments , but at present its pole position in the complex energy plane is rather well determined  @xcite , which gives support to the e791 findings .    in our approach , we calculate the weak decay @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , using the effective weak hamiltonian within the factorization approximation .",
    "the @xmath13-wave final state is then constructed using the scalar _ form factor _ previously introduced in the context of @xmath14 decays to pions and kaons@xcite .",
    "this model for the fsi , based on the framework developed in  @xcite , is unitary and takes into account the coupling to the @xmath15 channel .",
    "the @xmath16-wave , which mainly corresponds to the @xmath17 , and the @xmath3-wave , arising from the @xmath18 , are described by the usual breit - wigner functions .",
    "the general idea of the model is depicted in fig .",
    "1 : the @xmath19 produced at the weak vertex acts as a spectator of the rescattering between the other two pions .",
    "the amplitude is to be symmetrized since there are two identical pions in the final state .",
    "to evaluate the weak decays @xmath20 , we use an effective weak hamiltonian within the qcd factorization approximation . in the present case ,",
    "the contributions from strong penguins are ckm suppressed and can be safely neglected which allows one to work at tree level .",
    "assuming that the @xmath5 is scalar - isoscalar with a @xmath21 quark content , the result for the decay @xmath22 can be cast as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the pion decay constant , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the @xmath3 meson , pion and @xmath28 masses , respectively , @xmath29 is a transition form factor treated as a parameter of the model , @xmath30 is the fermi constant and @xmath31 is the ckm matrix element for the transition @xmath32 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath33 is a combination of wilson coefficients , @xmath34 .",
    "it is worth stressing that this expression is simplified by the fact it receives no contribution from the color suppressed diagram since the matrix element @xmath35 with @xmath36 vanishes by symmetry .",
    "the result for the weak decay @xmath37 is very similar but one must also add the non - zero @xmath38 component of the @xmath12 , which can be done introducing a mixing angle @xmath39 in the spirit of  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath40 amplitude does receive a contribution from the color suppressed diagram , proportional to @xmath41 , since now @xmath42 .",
    "one can construct the @xmath43 final state using a form factor to describe the propagation and decay into two pions of the resonance @xmath44 .",
    "usually a breit - wigner function is used for this purpose @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we employ a model for the @xmath1-wave in which four scalar form factors are introduced to describe the @xmath45 and @xmath46 fsi  @xcite .",
    "however , in the case being considered here , only one of them , namely @xmath47 , enters in the calculations .",
    "this model respects unitarity and the coupling to the @xmath48 channel is properly accounted for .",
    "employing an approximation where all the particles are taken to be on - shell , this form factor is given analytically  @xcite : it is written in terms of the scalar - isoscalar scattering phase shifts and inelasticities  @xcite @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , as well as of the production functions @xmath52 and @xmath53 obtained in chiral perturbation theory @xcite . below the @xmath54 threshold watson s theorem",
    "is fulfilled : the phase of the form factor @xmath47 is given by @xmath49 .",
    "the full amplitude @xmath55 can then be written as @xmath56\\ , \\label{eq : m}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : weakdsigma ] ) .",
    "this amplitude is symmetrized as shown in fig .",
    "1 , it is expressed in terms of two lorentz invariant quantities namely @xmath58 and @xmath59 , following the labels used in fig .",
    "1 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : m ] ) , @xmath60 is a normalization constant related to the coupling between the pions and the scalar resonance , estimated to be @xcite @xmath61 gev@xmath62 .",
    "the amplitude for the decay @xmath63 is written similarly @xmath64\\ ,   \\label{eq : mrho}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 , @xmath66 is a relativistic breit - wigner @xcite and @xmath67 the corresponding weak amplitude .",
    "the @xmath3-wave is included in the model by means of another breit - wigner function and two additional parameters : a magnitude @xmath68 and a phase @xmath69 .",
    "the total amplitude is written as the sum of all the partial waves @xmath70 this expression is in a form suited to obtain a dalitz plot in terms of @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "eq . ( [ eq : mtotal ] ) enables one to perform a fit to the e791 data reproduced as in @xcite .",
    "we show in tab . 1 preliminary results for the normalization constant @xmath60 and for the transition form factor @xmath73 .",
    "the value for @xmath60 is in agreement with the results from @xcite whereas our value for @xmath74 is smaller than @xmath75 obtained in @xcite .    in tab .",
    "2 we show our results for the fit fractions ( f.f.s . ) , which measure the contribution of each channel to the total dalitz plot . due to interference effects , the sum of the f.f.s . is not necessarily 100% . in our model , the @xmath76",
    "fit fraction approximatively corresponds to the sum of the f.f.s .",
    "of @xmath28 , nr and @xmath77 of cleo  @xcite .",
    "compared to oller s work , we do not introduce a non - resonant background . the description of the @xmath1-wave , unified as it is in the @xmath47 form factor , avoids the use of a sum of breit - wigner functions .",
    "use of a unitary model for the @xmath78 fsi enables us to reproduce the @xmath1-wave two - pion resonance spectrum in @xmath79 .",
