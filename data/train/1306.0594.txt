    "the correlation of central black hole ( m@xmath2 ) and stellar bulge mass ( e.g. gultekin et al . 2009 ; 2012 ) , and the similarity between the cosmic star formation history ( e.g. hopkins @xmath3 beacom 2006 ) and cosmic m@xmath2 assembly history ( e.g. aird et al 2010 ) both suggest that the growth of supermassive black holes ( smbh ) is related to the growth of host galaxies .",
    "understanding what drives the formation and co - evolution of galaxies and their central smbhs remains one of the most significant challenges in extragalactic astrophysics .",
    "understanding the feedback mechanisms , hence the agn energy production , remains a fundamental question that needs to be answered .",
    "recent attention has focused on models where agn feedback regulates the star formation in the host galaxy .",
    "these scenarios are consistent with the @xmath4 - @xmath5 relation and make various predictions for agn properties , including the environmental dependence of the agn / galaxy interplay and the relative timing of periods of peak star formation and nuclear accretion activity .",
    "the key feature of these models is that they can potentially link the apparently independent observed relations between star formation , agn activity and large scale structure to the same underlying physical process .",
    "for example , in the  radio - mode \" model of croton et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , accretion of gas from cooling flows in dense environments ( e.g. group , cluster ) may produce relatively low - luminosity agn , which in turn heat the bulk of the cooling gas and prevent it from falling into the galaxy center to form stars .",
    "alternatively , hopkins et al .",
    "( 2006 ) propose that mergers trigger luminous qsos and circumnuclear starbursts , which both feed and obscure the central engine for most of its active lifetime . in this scenario ,",
    "agn outflows eventually sweep away the dust and gas clouds , thereby quenching the star formation .",
    "this  qso - mode \" likely dominates in poor environments ( e.g. field , group ) , as the high - velocity encounters , common in dense regions , do not favour mergers .",
    "these proposed models make clear , testable predictions about the properties of agn , while observational constraints provide first - order confirmation of this theoretical picture ( e.g. trichas et al .",
    "2009 ; 2012 ) .",
    "merger - driven scenarios for example , predict an association between optical morphological disturbances , star formation and an intense obscured agn phase in low density regions .",
    "the  radio mode \" model , in contrast , invokes milder agn activity in early - type hosts and relatively dense environments with little or no star formation .",
    "low - redshift galaxies offer the best observational testbeds to study quasar evolution . while environmental studies of nearby agn are consistent with non- merger - driven fueling ( constantin @xmath3 vogeley 2006 ; constantin , hoyle , @xmath3 vogeley 2008 ) , analysis of the observed distribution of eddington ratios as a function of the bh masses suggest that at z@xmath60 there might be two distinct regimes of bh growth , which are determined by the supply of cold gas in the host bulge ( kauffmann @xmath3 heckman 2009 ) .",
    "optical studies of narrow emission line galaxies using emission line ratio diagnostics ( e.g. trichas et al .",
    "2010 ; kalfountzou et al . 2011 ) although quite successful in identifying cases where the dominant mechanism is either accretion onto a black hole or radiation from hot young stars , remain inconclusive for liners and composite objects .",

    "( 2009 ) revealed a sequence from sf via agn to quiescence which may be the first empirical evidence for a duty cycle analogous to that of the high - z quasars .",
    "the x - ray emission arguably affords , the most sensitive test for measurements of the intensity and efficiency of accretion .",
    "combining x - ray properties with optical emission line ratios for a large unbiased sample of low redshift galaxies can be especially useful because of the high quality diagnostics available .",
    "the chandra source catalog ( evans et al .",
    "2010 ) when cross - matched with the sdss , provides an unprecedented number of galaxies in the local universe for which we can combine measurements of both the x - ray and optical emission .",
    "previous studies of the relation between the x - ray nuclear emission , optical emission line activity and black hole masses provide important physical constraints to the agn accretion .",
    "the conclusions are that low - luminosity agn ( llagn ) are probably scaled down versions of more luminous agn ( e.g. , panessa et al .",
    "2006 ) , and that @xmath4 is not the main driver of the x - ray properties ( greene @xmath3 ho 2007 ) .",

    "our sample has been obtained by cross - matching the sdss dr7 spectroscopic sample with the chandra source catalog .",

    "the latter included primarily stars and several broad absorption line quasars .",

    "we might suspect that a significant contribution from star formation might artificially soften our measured @xmath8 .",
    "however , the star - formation contribution from the host remains fairly constant as a function of @xmath24/l@xmath45 and in fact , the strongest contribution is where measured mean @xmath8 is hardest , so star - formation is not likely to affect the trend significantly .",
    "another extrinsic effect might be that the hardest measured @xmath8 values around the inflection point could be caused by larger , yet poorly - fit individual column densities , and/or some inverse correlation between the fit parameters @xmath8 and n@xmath57 as they compete to model the observed spectral shape .",
    "figure[avggammareddnlagn ] ( right ) shows some marginal evidence that this could be a problem , because the hardest bin has the lowest mean n@xmath57 .",
    "we retested our fits to the relations @xmath8 , as a function of @xmath42 for all sources in our sample after excluding all spectroscopically identified narrow - line agn , and find no significant difference .",

    "indeed , such @xmath1 trends may be expected to be stronger than those with @xmath8 , because the optical / uv emission tracks disk emission with greater separation from agn x - ray emission , which is more strongly dominated by the corona .",

    "we confirm a significant v - shaped trend across a large sample of x - ray detected galaxies and agn in the plane of x - ray spectral hardness and eddington ratio , when expressed as @xmath24/l@xmath45 .",
    "the dispersion in the trend is significant for a variety of reasons beyond intrinsic dispersion in the accretion states of agn .",
    "the x - ray spectral fits are often marginal due to poor photon statistics , and are generally unable to model the known x - ray spectral complexity of real agn , including possible warm absorption , reflection components , etc .",
    "we further acknowledge the rather significant uncertainties involved in estimation of the eddington luminosities from the @xmath4 - @xmath5 relation ( for narrow emission and absorption line galaxies ) and the fwhm(h@xmath16)/@xmath80 method ( for blagn ) .",
    "nevertheless , despite the intrinsic dispersion and measurement uncertainties , we find on average a v - shaped correlation between x - ray spectral hardness and eddington ratio that is similar both in shape and in the location of the inflection point , to analogous trends seen in x - ray binary systems as they vary .",
    "when separating agn by ( optical spectroscopic emission line ) classification , the strongest trend is shown by the nlagn .",
    "a necessarily rather simple analysis shows no evidence that this apparent trend is either strengthened or caused by the contributions of softer stellar emission components or hardening due to intrinsic absorption .",
    "we also test for a predicted v - shaped trend of x - ray to optical spectral slope @xmath1 with eddington ratio , but find only a monotonic relationship whereby blagn become relatively more x - ray bright ( weak ) compared to eddington ratio expressed in terms of x - ray ( total agn ) luminosity .",
