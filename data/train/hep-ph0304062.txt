    "the strong cp problem reveals itself by the term of lagrangian permitting the cp - violation in an explicit form @xmath1 where _ a priori _ free quantity @xmath0 denotes the effective parameter including the bare contribution as well as the term caused by the matrix of quark masses @xmath2 , @xmath3 the smallness of @xmath0 following from the experimental observations , basically , by the constraints on the electric dipole moment of neutron , looks rather accidental in qcd , unless we do not involve some additional mechanisms .",
    "the most elegant opportunity is the peccei ",
    "quinn symmetry @xcite introducing an axion field coupled to the cp - odd product of gluon strength tensors in ( [ bare ] ) . in that case",
    ", the quantity @xmath0 gains the dynamical nature due to the axion @xmath4 , so that @xmath5 , where we have introduced the axion decay constant @xmath6 , and the problem is solved by an appropriate effective potential for @xmath0 , if the minimal energy is reached at @xmath7 .",
    "since the bare and quark mass terms in @xmath0 lead to a global additive redefinition of axion field , we can easily see that the positive mass squared of axion in the effective action is a necessary condition in order to control the stability , while the position of stable point should be at @xmath8 to get the above solution of strong cp - problem .",
    "the real value of axion mass depends on whether the axion is coupled to the quark fields or not .",
    "the corresponding term of fermion contribution is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 marks the quark flavor @xcite .",
    "there is a possibility to introduce the coupling to the leptons , too , @xcite .",
    "so , due to the fermion component the mixing of axion with the pseudo - goldstone bosons appearing under the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry results in the following general formula @xcite for the axion mass : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the color anomaly of peccei ",
    "quinn current , which we put equal to 1 , @xmath13 denotes the quark condensate with @xmath14 and @xmath15 mev . ] , while @xmath16 is a dimensional quantity ordinary represented by the instanton - induced term in the effective potential .",
    "therefore , the light quarks coupled to the axion essentially change the situation , since they suppress purely gluon contribution .",
    "nevertheless , the consideration of gluon term in the quadratic @xmath0-action remains actual as the leading correction to the quark condensate , if the axion is coupled to the quarks , or as the main term , if the axion is coupled to the gluons , only .    in the present study",
    "we calculate the effective action quadratic in @xmath0 due to the contribution of the local gluon condensate",
    ". this contribution can be competitive with the term induced by the instantons , since , first , as observed by the lattice simulations , the instantons do not dominate in the determination of vacuum properties in qcd because the vacuum is too warm , second , modelling the gluon condensate by the dilute instanton gas is problematic as the gas should consist of rather wide and dense instantons in order to reach the observed magnitude of the gluon condensate .",
    "in addition , the distribution over the instanton sizes involves extra model - parameters .",
    "thus , the gluon condensate contribution itself is of interest .",
    "in the calculation of diagram shown in fig . [ fglu ] we take the leading term caused by the local gluon condensate , @xmath17 so that we can write down its contribution to the effective action in the explicit form @xmath18 where the combinatoric factor @xmath19 is determined by the permutations of gluon strength tensors and the evident relation @xmath20 .",
    "( 100,45 ) ( 5,0)=85 ( 10,15)@xmath0 ( 80,15)@xmath0 ( 39,39)vacuum    for the vacuum expectation value we evidently have the following general expression conserving the color and lorentz symmetries : @xmath21 then , we find the gluon condensate part of quadratic term in the effective potential for the global phase @xmath0 @xmath22 = \\theta^2\\ ; \\left\\langle \\frac{\\alpha_s^2}{8\\pi^2 } g^{\\mu\\nu}_a   g_{\\mu\\nu}^a \\right\\rangle,\\label{glu}\\ ] ] while the linear term due to the bare lagrangian in ( [ bare ] ) does not contribute into the vacuum energy , since the physical vacuum infers condition ( [ real ] ) .    we can straightforwardly get the contribution given by the local quark condensate into the quadratic term of axion in the way analogous to the described calculation with the gluon condensate , so that @xmath23 = - a^2\\;\\sum_n \\frac{|g_n|^2}{m_n}\\,\\langle \\bar q_n q_n\\rangle,\\label{quark}\\ ] ] which can be further transformed after the substitution for the universal coupling of the axion to the quarks @xcite @xmath24 expressing a consistency for the definition of axion decay constant through the calculation of axial anomaly and the absence of mass mixing between the axion and neutral pseudo - goldstone mesons @xmath25 and @xmath26 . here , @xmath2 denotes the diagonal mass matrix of light quarks ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "then , we get @xmath23 = - \\frac{1}{2 } \\frac{a^2}{f_a^2}\\ ; \\langle \\bar q q\\rangle\\,\\frac{m_um_d}{m_u+m_d},\\label{quark2}\\ ] ] which reproduces the result of @xcite in the case of quark condensate dominance .",
    "we stress that the mixing of the axion with the flavor - singlet meson leads to the quadratic axion potential tending to zero in the limit of massless light quark in agreement with the general formula given by ( [ chir ] ) despite the calculated term due to the local gluon condensate .    indeed , comparing ( [ quark2 ] ) with ( [ glu ] ) after the substitution of @xmath28 we could observe that the contribution by the local gluon condensate dominates in the axion mass .",
    "the picture is critically changed , if we take into account the neutral singlet of su(3 ) flavor group .",
    "this singlet is coupled to the gluon anomaly , too , in the same manner as the axion with an analogous constant @xmath29 instead of @xmath6 , which produces the mixing of masses for the axion and singlet @xcite .",
    "the resulting effect has been described in the introduction , and we return to the quark condensate dominance in the axion mass up to small corrections .",
    "the description of above mechanism is given in @xcite in detail .",
    "nevertheless , we stress that expression ( [ glu ] ) gives explicit result in contrast to rather indefinite instanton - induced potential .",
    "let us discuss the renormalization group ( rg ) properties of results obtained .",
    "first , we can easily see that the contribution by the quark condensate ( [ quark2 ] ) enters into the axion mass in the rg invariant form , since the ratio of quark masses and the product of quark mass with the condensate are invariant under the action of rg .",
    "second , the gluon condensate term due to ( [ glu ] ) reveals the rg dependence with nonzero anomalous dimension in qcd .",
    "however , this anomalous dimension is in the next @xmath30-order under study . therefore , we have no any contradiction with the qcd principles in the given accuracy over @xmath30",
    ".    we do not make some numerical estimates , since they would be rather qualitative under assumptions on the effective value of @xmath30 .",
    "thus , we clarify the physical meaning of our calculations and results .",
    "we have calculated the contribution by the local gluon condensate into the effective potential quadratic over the @xmath0 determining the cp - violating term of the gluon anomaly in qcd .",
    "such the effective potential gives the contribution into the axion mass providing the solution of strong cp - problem in the peccei ",
    "quinn mechanism .",
    "we expect the dominance of contribution caused by the local gluon condensate in comparison with the instanton - induced potential , which could be tested by the lattice simulations .",
    "the axion plays an essential role in the connection of particle physics with the cosmology , in particular , as a dark matter candidate @xcite .",
    "this fact makes the studies on its mass to be rather significant .",
