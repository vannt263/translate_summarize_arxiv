    "the phenomenon has played a significant role in topics ranging from basic research on superconductivity and superfluidity to applications in electronics @xcite .",
    "the josephson effect in combination with magnetism , or spin - dependence in the generic case , has yielded several new physical phenomena .",
    "examples include @xmath0 junctions  @xcite , spin - triplet cooper - pair current  @xcite , and the enhancement , or tunability , of the critical current in superconductor - ferromagnet structures  @xcite .",
    "another , striking prediction concerning spin - dependent josephson systems is the existence of a spin - asymmetric josephson effect in which the cooper - paired spins display frequency - synchronized oscillations with spin - dependent amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "traditionally , the josephson effect has been understood as the coherent tunneling of bosons , either elementary or composite , as in the case of cooper pairs , with no significant difference between these two cases  @xcite . however , the spin - asymmetric josephson effect  @xcite shows that in fermionic condensates the composite nature of cooper pairs is always important and manifests itself in a dramatic way as a spin - polarized josephson current .    .",
    "the initial state of the system is a superposition of the paired states , @xmath1 .",
    "the tunneling couplings @xmath2 and @xmath3 cause josephson oscillations in the system .",
    "the couplings connect the paired states via intermediate states of broken pairs , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which are populated in the josephson oscillations .",
    "the spin - dependent potentials @xmath6 and @xmath7 create an energy difference between these intermediate states , resulting in different populations on these states , and thus the spin - asymmetric josephson effect . ]    in this work , we suggest an experimental arrangement to detect the yet - unobserved spin - asymmetric josephson effect .",
    "the proposed setup is a spin - dependent superlattice , realizable , e.g. , in ultracold atomic gas systems  @xcite .",
    "we simulate the quantum dynamics of the system in the case of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) superlattice , utilizing the time - evolving block decimation ( tebd ) method @xcite .",
    "our results indicate that the observation of the spin - asymmetric josephson effect is feasible with existing experimental techniques .",
    "furthermore , we show that the spin - asymmetric josephson effect elucidates the physical origin of the predicted enhancement  @xcite , in general tunability , of the critical direct current ( dc ) in superconductor - ferromagnet structures . detecting the spin - asymmetric josephson effect",
    "would provide fundamental understanding of macroscopic quantum coherence and anticipate highly tunable josephson devices .    in the spin - asymmetric josephson effect",
    "the system of interest is conceptually a josephson junction where the two spin components of a cooper pair are subjected to different potentials @xmath6 and @xmath7 , while the junction barrier is an insulator with no additional spin - dependence .",
    "the spin components oscillate at the same josephson frequency but , suprisingly , with different amplitudes , yielding the josephson current @xmath8}$ ] . here , @xmath9 , @xmath10 denotes the opposite spin , and @xmath11 is the initial phase difference .",
    "the asymmetric oscillations are in sharp contrast to the usual view of composite boson tunneling and occur even though the pairing is of singlet - type , and no triplet - pairing is required .",
    "the effect is best understood in terms of a four state model of fig .",
    "[ fig : basics1 ] which demonstrates the dynamics of a single cooper pair initially in a coherent superposition across the tunneling barrier  @xcite .",
    "this model elucidates that the tunneling occurs through intermediate states consisting of @xmath12 and @xmath13 spin components on different sides of the junction .",
    "the salient point is that the josephson current contains _ single - particle _ interference terms occurring on these intermediate states , even at zero temperature and in the absence of initial quasiparticle excitations .",
    "importantly , these interferences are different for the current of each component in the presence of spin - asymmetric potentials , leading to the spin - asymmetric josephson effect .",
    "the spin - asymmetric potential is in close analogy to an exchange field in a ferromagnet .",
    "however , the spin - asymmetric josephson effect is fundamentally different from the critical current reversal in superconductor - ferromagnet - superconductor ( sfs ) @xmath0-junctions  @xcite and from the spin - triplet supercurrent discovered in multilayered ferromagnetic josephson junctions  @xcite . in these phenomena",
    "the barrier between the superconductors plays the key role  @xcite , while in the spin - asymmetric josephson effect the barrier can be just an insulator with no preference on spin , and the underlying physics results from the spin - dependent potentials instead .",
    "here we demonstrate that the spin - asymmetric josephson effect is more closely related to a phenomenon which can occur in an sfifs ( i stands for insulator ) junction , see fig .",
    "[ fig : basics2 ] .",
    "it has been predicted that , for antiparallel magnetizations in the f layers , the critical dc josephson current can be tuned by varying the magnetization  @xcite .",
    "this happens when the sf - bilayer structure can be considered a uniform magnetic superconductor ( note that a very different type of behavior is anticipated for instance in long junctions  @xcite ) .",
    "the assumption for the uniform magnetic superconductor holds when the thickness of the s layer is less than the superconducting coherence length , and the thickness of the f layer is less than the condensate penetration length to the ferromagnet  @xcite .",
    "the uniform magnetization plays a role similar to the spin - asymmetric potential but an essential difference is that the exchange field of the ferromagnet affects also the ground state of the system , unlike in the spin - asymmetric josephson effect .",
    "however , we show that at zero temperature these two scenarios lead to the same outcome .",
    "the derivation of the result follows closely the standard linear response description of the josephson effect , and we present it in detail in appendix  [ app : connection ] . here",
    ", we give only the result .",
    "we obtain the following form for the critical current of the @xmath12-component in the sfifs - junction with antiparallel magnetizations @xmath14.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the critical current of the @xmath13-component has a similar expression . in the above expression",

    ", we conclude that the form of the critical current is the same in the magnetically tuned sfifs junction and in the josephson junction driven by spin - asymmetric potentials .",

    ", the time evolution of the initial state @xmath148 to second order in the tunneling is @xmath156 the zeroth and first order contributions to the total particle number of state @xmath157 defined by @xmath158 are the initial particle number and zero , respectively .",
    "( here , the particle number is a slightly more convenient quantity to calculate , and the current is given by its time derivative . )",
    "the second order contribution to @xmath159 is    @xmath160    in the first term of the last expression above , @xmath161 has been relabeled as @xmath162 and vice versa .",
    "we then simplify equation   by taking into account the specific form of the initial state .",
    "let us consider as an example the case @xmath163 .",
    "for @xmath163 , the tunneling matrix element @xmath164 sets directly @xmath165 . for indices",
    "@xmath166 we have similarly the possibilities @xmath167 .",
    "now , the operators @xmath168 and @xmath169 above do not change the number of unpaired particles , while the opposite is true for @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "for example the operator @xmath171 acting on a state with no unpaired particles would create an unpaired fermion on states @xmath172 and @xmath173 ( since the fermion on @xmath174 is removed ) . the remaining operator @xmath170 then has to act so that both of these unpaired states are removed ( either by annihilating the remaining fermion or by creating the missing fermion ) , or otherwise the resulting state is orthogonal to @xmath175 and the matrix element is zero .",
    "since @xmath168 and @xmath169 are not relevant for finding the surviving matrix elements , we leave these operators out of the notation in the following . for the spin indices @xmath176 we find @xmath177 in other words , these arrangements of spin indices can only break cooper pairs and the matrix elements vanish .    for the indices",
    "@xmath178 we find non - zero matrix - elements for particular momenta @xmath179 . again , taking into account the cooper pairing of @xmath148 we find these matrix elements to be @xmath180    returning to the full notation , the second order result of eq .",
    "is then written as    @xmath181    here we have used the notation @xmath182 for opposite spin , i.e.  @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 , and @xmath186 . finally we take the summation over the momenta and spins in front of the whole expression .",
    "the result is then of the form @xmath187,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] i.e.  a summation over all possible four state systems .",
    "a single term of this sum is equivalent to the second order perturbation theory result with only the two couplings @xmath188 and @xmath189 with the relevant initial state being the superposition of the cooper pairs of states @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",
    "more precisely , this superposition originates from the initial many - body state as follows .",
    "the full initial state is a combination of two bcs states @xmath192 for each pair of couplings @xmath193 and @xmath194 we rewrite the initial state as @xmath195 and further as @xmath196 from this form we see that the @xmath197-term corresponds to an empty state with respect to @xmath193 and @xmath194 , and does not contribute to the dynamics .",
    "similarly , the @xmath198-term does not contribute to the dynamics since it is pauli blocked .",
    "the remaining superposition of the two states @xmath199 and @xmath200 is then formally the initial state of the time - evolution under @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "the two intermediate states @xmath201 and @xmath202 are also required to describe the time - evolution , and thus the four - state system is complete .    to conclude",
    ", the analysis of the ( spin - asymmetric ) josephson effect presented in our previous work  @xcite can indeed be applied to a general tunneling coupling , and not just a momentum conserving one , which is precisely what we set out to prove .",
    "notice , however , that the derivation above holds only to the second order of perturbation theory . in higher orders of the perturbation expansion",
    "there are terms present which , e.g. , involve more than two momentum states .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : result2 ] of the main text , we show that for experimentally observable particle oscillations the josephson contribution consists of several sub - peaks instead of a single spin - asymmetric signal .",
    "moreover , the center peak in fig .",
    "[ fig : result2 ] is slightly shifted from the typical josephson frequency of @xmath203 . here , we elucidate the origin of these effects by studying smaller lattice systems with second - order time - independent perturbation theory with respect to the tunneling matrix elements in eq .   of the main text .",
    "the shift of the josephson frequency from @xmath203 can be obtained by considering a half - filled hubbard dimer ( a two - site system with two particles ) governed by the fermi ",
    "hubbard hamiltonian in eq .   of the main text . here",
    ", the unperturbed hamiltonian is given by @xmath204 and the perturbation is @xmath205    the josephson oscillations ( which are a second order effect in @xmath47 ) occur between the paired states @xmath206 the first order corrections to the energies , @xmath207 , are zero , while the second order corrections can be calculated from @xmath208 yielding @xmath209 thus , we obtain the perturbed josephson frequency as ( here , @xmath68 ) @xmath210 where the last two terms give the shift in the frequency .",
    "to explain the emergence of several josephson signals , it suffices to investigate a four - site system described by the hamiltonian in eq .   of the main text .",
    "we again take the unperturbed hamiltonian to be @xmath211 while the perturbation reads @xmath212    as an example , we consider the following two paired states ( other states are treated similarly ) @xmath213 , @xmath214 , and @xmath215 , respectively .",
    "we can then calculate the frequency of the unperturbed josephson oscillations as @xmath216 which is precisely the typical josephson frequency .",
    "the perturbed josephson frequencies are then given by @xmath219 and @xmath220 we see that the josephson frequencies of these processes are no longer equal and the difference reads @xmath221 this is approximately the frequency separation between adjacent sub - peaks in fig .
