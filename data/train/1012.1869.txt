    "clusters of galaxies are the most massive bound systems in the universe .",
    "the present - day cluster population is dominated by early - type galaxies which make up a tight `` red sequence '' in color - magnitude diagram @xcite .",
    "the analyses of the zero - point , slope , and scatter of the color - magnitude relation have been playing key roles in understanding when and how galaxies in clusters are formed and evolved ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "studies of low to intermediate redshift clusters indicate that the majority of stars in cluster galaxies are formed at @xmath11  ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , detailed morphological analyses of the cluster red galaxies suggest that a significant fraction of the present - day cluster early - type galaxies must have been fully assembled after @xmath12 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . a significant rise in star - formation activity in the cluster cores",
    "is also seen as one goes to higher ( @xmath13 ) redshift , the `` butcher - oemler effect '' @xcite .",
    "studies of the butcher - oemler effect , as well as the morphological transformation in cluster cores , have been among the major topics in extragalactic astronomy for the past two decades ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "as the observational data have been accumulated for ever more distant galaxy clusters , the `` break '' of the red sequence at fainter magnitudes and its evolution has attracted great attention ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these phenomena have been discussed in the framework of the `` down - sizing '' of the star - formation activity , whereby the stellar mass of the galaxies which host star formation at a fixed rate is , on average , decreasing with cosmic time .",
    "the evolution of the faint end of the red sequence is also connected to the continuous infall of star - forming galaxies into the cluster cores , their subsequent cessation of star - formation , and change in their morphologies @xcite .    from the local universe to intermediate redshifts ( @xmath14 ) , a number of studies suggest that star formation is strongly suppressed in the cluster cores compared with the low - density field environment ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for passively - evolving early - type galaxies , there is also weak , but growing , evidence that the luminosity - weighted ages of galaxies tend to be older in higher density environments .",
    "this suggests that perhaps the time scale of star formation and/or secondary episodes of the star formation vary with environment @xcite .",
    "recently , however , this trend is observed to flatten or even reverse , with the density dependence of star - formation disappearing or with enhanced star - formation in the cluster core at z@xmath15 @xcite .",
    "if the majority of the massive cluster galaxies ( @xmath16 ) begin forming their stars at @xmath11 , they will have high star formation rates at higher redshifts . @xcite",
    "have surveyed star - forming galaxies in the x - ray cluster xmmxcs j2215.9 - 1738 at @xmath17 using a narrowband filter that samples the redshifted [ o ] doublet located at the cluster redshift .",
    "they showed that the [ o ] emitting star - forming galaxies are prevalent everywhere in the cluster including its core region ( see also , @xcite ) .",
    "although star formation is still confined to the cluster outskirts in other @xmath18 cluster @xcite , the widespread star formation in xmmxcs j2215.9 - 1738 is in strong contrast to similar surveys of lower redshift clusters at @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the color - magnitude relation for xmmxcs j2215.9 - 1738 also shows a larger scatter than those of other intermediate redshift clusters @xcite .",
    "although we need a larger sample of clusters at intermediate and high redshifts to discern a general trend in the star formation @xmath21 galaxy density relation @xcite , the existence of widespread star formation activity in this @xmath22 cluster strongly suggests that we are gradually approaching the major epoch of galaxy formation in cluster environments .    at higher redshifts ( @xmath11 ) ,",
    "the number of the known ( proto- ) clusters is still quite small , and the majority of the known proto - clusters were discovered in narrowband ly@xmath0-emitter surveys . with some exceptions ( e.g. , @xcite ) , much of the search for proto - clusters has been done around powerful radio galaxies and qsos with known redshifts ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the success of these searches around radio galaxies is related to the fact that the host galaxies of the powerful radio sources tend to be the most massive galaxies at any epoch of the universe @xcite .",
    "powerful radio sources are powered by central super - massive black holes , and the large inferred masses of the black holes in turn imply massive host stellar systems @xcite .",
    "the largest galaxies in the universe tend to lie in the centers of largest - scale haloes which must have originated from the primordial density peaks where galaxy formation processes are accelerated in a biased way @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite analyzed the broadband sed of galaxies in the pks  1138 proto - cluster and found that proto - cluster galaxies show suppressed star - formation on average compared to field galaxies ( see also , @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that even at @xmath23 the activity in the cluster core region seems to lag behind the star - formation activity we see in galaxies in field surveys .",
    "@xcite also reported older stellar ages for their @xmath24 proto - cluster than for field galaxies in the same survey , implying a similar trend .",
    "the detection of a possible ( proto- ) red - sequence in four known proto - cluster fields at @xmath23 via @xmath25 photometry @xcite also indicates that , though the star - formation is also likely to be prevalent there , some @xmath10-bright galaxies may already be converging to the red - sequence .    at higher redshifts ,",
    "there are some hints that more intense star - formation is occurring even in the proto - cluster environment . in the ssa22 field , which is known to contain a large overdensity of galaxies at @xmath26 @xcite",
    ", @xcite detected a significant number of the extended ly@xmath0 blobs which are thought to be progenitors of massive galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "two of the largest ly@xmath0 blobs are identified with red , massive ( @xmath27 ) galaxies , comparable to dominant cluster galaxies at @xmath28  @xcite . @xcite",
    "have detected an excess of aztec @xmath29 mm - sources in the same ssa22 field .",
    "the positional correlation of the aztec sources with the ly@xmath0 emitter distribution at @xmath26 suggests that dust - enshrouded vigorous star - formation might be going on in the field .",
    "there is also a report of a significant excess of submm - bright objects in the tnj  1338 - 1942 field at @xmath30 , which is known to have a proto - cluster identified by ly@xmath0 emitters @xcite .",
    "as was demonstrated by @xcite , star formation activity in cluster cores should have been as vigorous as in the field environment at some point in the past ( and may exceed it at even higher redshifts ) . to observe this crossover point we need larger samples of proto - clusters at @xmath3124 .",
    "the field around 4c  23.56 is one of the most promising proto - cluster candidates at @xmath11 ( @xcite , hereafter kc97 ) .",
    "the authors detected an excess of candidate ly@xmath0 emitters as well as an excess of very red objects in @xmath32 color in their survey field ( 1.25  arcmin@xmath33 ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite took deep @xmath34 and @xmath35 images with cisco on subaru and found a significant excess of distant red galaxies ( drgs , @xcite ) in a @xmath36 arcmin@xmath33 field .",
    "this further supports the idea that there are a number of evolved galaxies in this proto - cluster at @xmath37 .",
    "however , both of these surveys have very limited field coverage and they may not be probing the whole picture of the proto - cluster .",
    "so far no other follow - up observations , including any redshift confirmation , have been reported in the literature .",
    "here we present the result of our new h@xmath0 emitter ( hae ) search around 4c  23.56 with the wide - field near - infrared imager , moircs , mounted on the 8.2 m subaru telescope . in this study , we show that there is a clear and strong excess of the haes near the radio galaxy .",
    "we present their star formation properties and discuss the characteristics of this proto - cluster by comparing with other fields at similar redshifts .",
    "archival _ spitzer _",
    "mips data are also used to probe dusty star forming activity in the proto - cluster .",
    "this is the first narrow - band h@xmath0 emitter survey of a proto - cluster field at @xmath11 after @xcite .",
    "the field size we cover is nearly 19 times larger than that of kc97 , and is more than twice as large as that of @xcite .",
    "we note that the survey redshift of @xmath38 is close to the red end of the h@xmath0-observable window ( @xmath39 ) from the ground , due to the significant rise of the thermal background beyond the _",
    "k_-band window .    throughout the paper , the standard @xmath40cdm cosmology with @xmath41 is assumed ( @xmath42 comoving mpc at @xmath43 ) .",
    "all the magnitudes presented in this paper are in the ab system unless otherwise noted .",
    "the primary data for the current work were collected using the multi - object infrared camera and spectrograph ( moircs , @xcite ) mounted on the cassegrain focus of the subaru 8.2-m telescope at mauna kea .",
    "the observations were executed during the second half - night of ut 1st june , 2007 , during the author s ( it ) subaru staff time .",
    "the weather was photometric but with variable seeing in the range @xmath44 .",
    "moircs has two independent sets of optics ( including both filters and detectors ) , which divide the full @xmath45 field of view ( fov ) into the two subfields ( channels 1 and 2 ) , each covering @xmath46 .",
    "we set the moircs position angle to @xmath47 so that the long side ( @xmath48 side ) of the fov aligns to the east - west direction . in this",
    "setting , the channel 1 fov is on the eastern ( left ) side ( see fig.[fig1]b ) .",
    "we used both the standard @xmath35-band filter and a narrowband ( nb ) filter called `` co '' or `` nb2288 '' .",
    "the nb filter has central wavelength @xmath49 m with a bandwidth of 0.023  @xmath50 m .",
    "note that these are the post - installation measured values ( m. akiyama , private communication ) .",
    "individual nb exposures were 300  s. in total , we obtained 16 exposures , yielding a total integration time of 4800  s. shallow data were also acquired in the @xmath35 band to enable continuum subtraction of the nb data .",
    "the @xmath35 band exposures were taken in 55  s and 3-coadds .",
    "we obtained 9 frames in total ( 1485  s ) .",
    "we found that stars on three images were elongated due to poor guiding at high elevation ( @xmath51 degrees ) .",
    "we rejected those frames during the final combine , resulting in a total integration of 990  s. we applied a standard circular - dither pattern with a diameter of @xmath52 .",
    "after the target observation , four position dithered data of the fs151 standard star were acquired in both the @xmath35 and nb2288 bands .",
    "we note that 4c  23.56 is close ( @xmath53 ) to a bright ( @xmath54 mag ) mira - type star .",
    "such bright stars are known to occasionally cause significant stray light on the image .",
    "fortunately , the effect was small during the night .",
    "however , stray light was seen in some of the data .",
    "it affected only a tiny portion ( @xmath55 ) of the total area , and we took care to mark the positions of any stray light before identifying the emitters .",
    "unfortunately , stray light caused a hole - like pattern near the radio galaxy in the @xmath35 data .",
    "due to this , the total magnitude for 4c  23.56 may be systematically wrong .",
    "for other targets , we confirmed that stray light does not affect the photometry .",
    "in general , the central wavelength of nb filters will shift with the angle of incidence of the light to the filter surface . in our case , therefore , the observable wavelength window will change with the position of targets on the detector . in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "we show the simulated shift of the filter transmission curve with source position on the detector ( the case for channel 2 is shown here : r. suzuki , private comm . ) .",
    "we find that the redshift range of interest , @xmath56 , is always covered by @xmath57 of the detector area . as a reference ,",
    "the expected wavelength of the h@xmath0 emission from 4c  23.56 is plotted as the arrow in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "note that the redshift of 4c  23.56 is @xmath58 by @xcite from c , he , and c ] lines .",
    "the bottom of fig.[fig1 ] shows the iso - redshift lines of the observable h@xmath0 emission for the center of the filter transmission .",
    "the iso - redshift line for 2.483 goes across the center of the detector . in the upper panel of fig.[fig1 ]",
    "we show that h@xmath0 emission at @xmath59 offset from 4c  23.56 can be observed everywhere but the very edge of the detector .",
    "the plot shows that the emitters blueshifted by @xmath60 relative to the radio galaxy will leave the filter at the center of the fov , while for objects redshifted by @xmath61 escape our detection in the outer 1/4 of the detector .",
    "though moircs uses two independent filters for the two channels , the difference of the center wavelength of these two nbs is only 3     ( @xmath62 difference at @xmath5 ) .",
    "it should not cause any systematics between the channels .",
    "we note that the velocity window of @xmath63 is just adequate for cluster member selection .",
    "simulations of x - ray clusters shows that the velocity dispersion of rich clusters generally gets smaller by about a factor of 2 as one goes from @xmath64 to 3  ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "also , the previous h@xmath0 emitter survey for a dense protocluster at @xmath9 by @xcite found a velocity dispersion of only @xmath65 ( narrower than the width of the nb filter for their pre - selection ) , small for the inferred richness of the protocluster .",
    "thus we would expect to detect a significant fraction of the protocluster h@xmath0 emitters within the moircs narrowband window if its dynamical center is at the same redshift and located on 4c  23.56 .",
    "data reduction of the moircs science frames was performed using the mcsred package , the iraf script pipeline for moircs imaging data developed by the author ( it ) . here",
    "we briefly describe the procedures in the pipeline for the potential user s convenience .",
    "the first step is flatfielding the data .",
    "we use a self - flat ( i.e. , maky a flatfield image from the dithered object images ) for the @xmath35 band .",
    "an object mask is essential for making good quality flatfields . to do this",
    ", we first make `` quasi - flatfielded '' images by subtracting the adjacent image in time from the image from which we make the object mask .",
    "such a `` quasi - flatfielded '' image will show a flat sky and objects in the image as positive - negative pairs .",
    "then the residual pattern in the sky of each quasi - flatfielded image is further subtracted by fitting a 3rd - order polynomial surface .",
    "this procedure is done independently for each quadrant , because moircs is a 4-channel readout system and any pattern related to the sky variation has discontinuities on quadrant boundaries . after replacing all the negative objects to the sky value",
    ", cosmic - ray removal is applied . each resulting image",
    "is then smoothed by gaussian kernel after a 3 by 3 boxcar median filter has been applied . at this stage",
    ", most objects are clearly seen on the smoothed image except very faint ones .",
    "then any area that has a signal larger than the threshold of @xmath66 of the original pixel - to - pixel variation are replaced by the `` mask '' value of 1 , with an additional expansion to the area ( here we set 5 pixels ) for large and bright objects .",
    "this quick object mask works well for the usual science exposures .",
    "we note that , though we can do the more accurate `` second - pass '' mask - making procedure after getting the final combined image , the result is almost the same and is not necessary for our data .    after making the object masks ,",
    "the flat frame is made from the science data itself with the mask applied . for the narrowband data we used dome flat data as we describe further below .",
    "after the flatfielding of the nb data , we further subtract the `` median sky '' image ( made with the object masks ) which is made from the subset ( typically 6 to 10 ) of the frames before and after the image for the sky subtraction .",
    "for the @xmath35 data this procedure can be skipped because the sky pattern is relatively smooth ( by the use of the self flat ) and so we can subtract the sky in the next procedure reasonably well .",
    "then we further subtract any residual sky pattern remaining on each image using a 3rd - order polynomial surface fitting for each quadrant .",
    "the resulting flatfielded , sky - subtracted images are then corrected to remove the geometric distortion .",
    "the distortion correction database , which is made from observations of astrometric reference fields , is supplied by the subaru observatory .",
    "we then measure the position of some ( typically 20 to 50 ) bright and compact objects on each image .",
    "the object catalogs for the images are further cross - matched with the catalog for the first image in the input list , and from the result we calculate the offset values we use to register the images to the first image . finally , these images are combined , where we weight by the rms@xmath33 of the input images .    a note on our nb2288 reduction :",
    "though we usually use the sky- or self - flats for the reduction , we used the dome flat data for correcting the pixel - to - pixel variation of the nb data .",
    "one reason is because the sky counts in the narrow - band filter are generally low compared with that of broad - band data .",
    "there is also the possibility that the sky may not be flat in the nb filter . due to the shift of the observable wavelength window with position ( see  2.1.1 ) , the inclusion or exclusion of oh night - sky lines into the window becomes position - dependent . although there is a small tilt pattern in the dome flats which is caused by the difference of the light path between dome data and object data , we estimate that the variation of the photometry due to the use of dome flat is @xmath67 ( @xmath68mag rms ) by putting standard stars at several positions across the field of view .",
    "this is small compared to our required accuracy .",
    "the object detection and the photometry are done using the `` double - image '' mode of sextractor 2.5.0  @xcite . for the detection image",
    ", we used the un - smoothed version of the narrowband data ; therefore , our catalog is a simple narrowband - based selection .",
    "the @xmath35 image is registered to this , and the seeing size is closely matched ( 6.0 pixel , @xmath69 arcsec fwhm ) for both images .",
    "the object detection is done within the area that is covered by more than 12 frames ( @xmath70 ) for nb2288 as well as 4 frames ( @xmath71 ) for k@xmath72 .",
    "for the detection parameters , we use the sextractor detect_thresh@xmath73 and detect_minarea@xmath74 with a tophat detection filter ( tophat_4.0_5x5.conv ) .",
    "the effective survey area is 23.6 arcmin@xmath75 which corresponds to a survey volume of 840.7 comoving mpc@xmath76 at z=2.49 considering our nb2288 filter bandwidth .",
    "we used aperture magnitudes in a diameter of 12 pixels ( @xmath77 or 11.5 kpc physical scale ) for color measurement , and the mag_auto values for derivation of the star - formation rates as well as for the stellar mass (  3.5 ) .",
    "the standard star data for fs151 were reduced using the same flatfielding data we used for the object reductions . the instrumental magnitude for fs151",
    "is measured from the individual 4 frames without combining them because the images are slightly defocused .",
    "these magnitudes were then averaged to get the final measurement . the instrumental magnitude for each frame",
    "is measured by the `` growth - curve '' method which estimates the convergence magnitude with increasing aperture radius .",
    "we used the iraf apphot package .",
    "the @xmath35-band magnitude for fs151 is taken from @xcite , with the @xmath78 conversion from the vega to ab - magnitude zeropoint applied @xcite .",
    "for the nb2288 magnitude , we used the @xmath35 magnitude and the low - dispersion template spectra of a g-3 dwarf star by @xcite .",
    "as a final check , we compared the @xmath10-band magnitude of some unsaturated stars in our catalog to the 2mass photometry .",
    "we find that the magnitudes are well matched at the @xmath79 magnitude level with a scatter of @xmath80 .",
    "good photometric error estimates are critical for robust detection of emission - line objects at lower equivalent widths ( ews ) . in our analysis",
    ", we use the following two methods .",
    "first , we measure aperture photometry in 1000 random ( blank ) regions to estimate the @xmath81 level of the sky variation .",
    "this yields 5-@xmath4 limiting magnitudes in a 12-pixel diameter aperture of 22.3 and 22.9 for @xmath35 and nb2288 , respectively .",
    "second , we estimate the scatter of the @xmath82nb2288 color introduced by the photometric uncertainty .",
    "we generated 70000 fake objects with various magnitudes and placed them randomly in blank image regions .",
    "after rebinning the sample points in 0.5-magnitude intervals of nb magnitude , the scatter of the output color excess ( @xmath82nb2288 ) is evaluated by measuring the distribution s @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 levels directly from the simulation .",
    "the result of this simulation is used for the estimate of the error on the color excess and on the selection of emitters .      in the current paper",
    ", we use some supplementary datasets (  3.1 &  3.4 ) and here we briefly describe them , though the full description will be presented elsewhere ( i. tanaka et al . in prep . ) .",
    "deep @xmath34-band data were taken using the ingrid camera  @xcite on the william herschel 4.2-m telescope ( wht ) , la palma .",
    "the data were acquired on the photometric nights of ut 2001 sep 7th and 8th , under good seeing conditions ( @xmath86 arcsec . ) .",
    "the ingrid camera has a hawaii hgcdte @xmath87 array , covering roughly @xmath88 field of view ( @xmath89/pixel ) on the cassegrain focus of the wht .",
    "the total integration time was 4800 s , resulting in a 50% detection completeness limit of 24.4 mag .",
    "the data were reduced in the standard manner , similar to the method for moircs data reduction .",
    "deep @xmath90-band data were taken by the suprime - cam on subaru telescope on the evening of ut 2009 nov 17th under clear but a marginal seeing condition ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "it was taken as part of our ly@xmath0 emitter search in this field .",
    "the net exposure time was 4500 s , having a limiting magnitude of 26.5 mag ( @xmath92 , -diameter aperture ) .",
    "the detail of the data reduction as well as the result of the broadband sed fitting analysis are to be described elsewhere ( i. tanaka et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "moircs mos spectroscopic observations of this field were done on ut 2006 september 7th ( s06b-106 : kodama et al . ) ; i.e. , before the acquisition of the narrow - band data we describe here . part of the target selection was done using a similar narrowband survey executed in september 2001 using the ingrid camera on wht ( it and cp ) , which should sample the redshift range of @xmath93 .",
    "the conditions were clear , with medium ( @xmath94 ) seeing conditions .",
    "we used the grism with a spectral resolution of @xmath95 in the _ k_-band window covering the @xmath96 spectral range .",
    "we used @xmath97 wide slits with typical slit lengths of @xmath98 .",
    "each single exposure was 600  s to 1200  s , depending on the airglow line strength .",
    "the standard a - b dither pattern was applied during each exposure . in total 2-hrs of integration were gathered .",
    "the mos data reduction was done in the standard manner using the mcsmdp pipeline ( pre - release version ) by one of the moircs builders ( t.  yoshikawa , private comm . ) .",
    "details of the mos reduction procedure by mcsmdp can be found in the recent paper of @xcite .",
    "finally , the deep 24 @xmath50 m imaging from _ spitzer_/mips were obtained as part of go program 30240 ( pi : a. stockton ) .",
    "the total exposure time in the central @xmath99 of the mosaic is approximately 5 ks .",
    "the 171 separate exposures each had a background fitted and then subtracted before a median of the array was determined .",
    "this median was then subtracted from each exposure .",
    "the exposures were then mosaicked with mopex software with standard inputs and resampling the pixels by a factor of 2 .    for the current analysis we focus on a subset of the 24 @xmath50m - selected sources that have clear irac counterparts .",
    "the mips photometry was extracted using daophot in iraf to fit an empirical psf model to multiple proximate ( within @xmath100 ) sources simultaneously .",
    "the mips source positions were pre - defined using the position of the closest irac counterpart .",
    "this photometry method mitigates the effects of source confusion .",
    "the selection of h@xmath0 emitters at @xmath38 is based on excess emission in nb2288 measured via @xmath82nb2288 color . in figure",
    "[ fig2 ] , we show the color - magnitude diagram for all objects detected in our observations .",
    "the overall distribution of the detected objects tends to become broader with increasing magnitudes due to the increasing photometric uncertainty .",
    "the intrinsic scatter is also seen for the brighter objects .",
    "the intrinsic scatter is caused by the variation of the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) in the @xmath35 band .",
    "the two curves labeled as @xmath101 & 3 in fig.[fig2 ] are the conventionally used measures of the significance of narrowband excess ( e.g. , @xcite ) . it is formulated as below , @xmath102,\\ ] ] where @xmath103 is the zeropoint of the narrowband image and @xmath104 is the photometric uncertainty .",
    "the @xmath101 line generally matches well with our simulated @xmath105 curve .",
    "as the color scatter becomes large at nb2288@xmath106 mag , we limit the selection of emission - line objects to @xmath107 and nb2288@xmath108 ( corresponding to @xmath109 level in 12-pixel aperture ) .",
    "we note that the use of our simulated @xmath105 scattering curve does not change the sample . at nb2288@xmath110 , there are actually only a few emission - line object candidates with @xmath107 , due to the steep rise of the selection curve .    at the bright end ,",
    "the intrinsic scatter is relatively large due to the variation of the seds in the @xmath35 band window and the selection of emitters with low - equivalent width may introduce spurious sources .",
    "we therefore introduce a further selection criterion using the rest - frame equivalent width , ew@xmath111  at @xmath5 .",
    "this corresponds to the @xmath112 nb2288 @xmath113 mag .",
    "the limiting h@xmath0 line flux of the emitter sample by these criteria is roughly @xmath114 .",
    "these values are computed using the same formula used in @xcite .",
    "we find 12 objects that satisfy the selection criteria set here . removing one object which is found to be a diffraction spike by visual inspection , the remaining 11 objects are cataloged as robust emission - line objects for further analysis .",
    "we note that the brightest object in the emitter sample is 4c  23.56 .",
    "the observational properties of the emitter sample are summarized in table  [ tbl1 ] .      though spectroscopic observations for all the emitter candidates are not obtained yet , four of the 11 emission - line candidates have nir spectroscopy .",
    "these data were taken before the acquisition of the current nb data .",
    "the one- and two - dimensional spectra for each target are shown in figures  [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] .",
    "hae#491 is the radio galaxy 4c  23.56 itself . due to",
    "the relatively low signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of the spectroscopy , unambiguous identification of h@xmath0 via detection of the nearby [ nii ] or [ sii ] lines is only possible for the radio galaxy .",

    "if these emission lines are not h@xmath0 but from the interlopers unrelated to 4c  23.56 , we can expect a more scattered distribution in wavelength range across the ingrid filter function .",
    "this is a strong indication that they are physically associated with each other and 4c  23.56 .",
    "our emission - line survey for h@xmath0 at @xmath5 may contain interlopers at different redshifts . as we showed in the previous section ,",

    "one object whose color is below the @xmath132 line could be an interloper , though we can not conclude this for certain until its spectra is obtained .",
    "one such object can be expected from the field survey as we see in  4.1 . during the following discussion we consider that all our selected emission - line objects are haes at @xmath37 , though a few of them might be foreground objects .",

    "the position of 4c  23.56 is marked with the large diamond .",

    "it is also not due to some unexpected trouble in the channel-2 filter , because 4c  23.56 and the adjacent two emitters are actually detected on the channel-2 side .",
    "the inhomogeneous distribution seems to be the reflection of the real distribution of the emitters .    if we suppose that the majority of the protocluster members are strongly redshifted relative to 4c  23.56 , the situation could change . as is discussed by  2.1.1",
    ", haes redshifted by @xmath1381000  km / s relative to 4c  23.56 will drop off from our detection window in the outer half of the fov . in the inner half of the fov",
    "we should detect objects with large velocity difference .",
    "though our three haes with spectroscopic redshift have small velocity offset ( @xmath139 ) , further spectroscopy for all the haes may uncover a biased velocity distribution .      here",
    "we comment on the objects in the area enclosed by the small white box in fig.[fig6 ] .",
    "there is a group of 4 emitters that lies within a @xmath140-diameter area ( = 300 kpc comoving ) , which is also shown in figure  [ fig7 ] as a zoomed view .",
    "we call this area the `` eastern clump ''",
    ". the compact size of the hae group suggests that they might eventually merge into one massive galaxy in the future and become ( one of ) the brightest cluster member(s ) .",
    "one notable character of haes in the eastern clump is that the light distribution of each hae in the nb2288 image is offset from the @xmath10-band object position , as shown in fig.[fig7 ] .",
    "especially interesting is that the offset direction of emission - line gas in three haes on the west side of the clump in fig.[fig7 ] is roughly aligned to the north to north west . to show these offsets more clearly , we ran sextractor on each image independently and measured the positional offset of objects detected in both images .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig8 ] . in the figure , the 1- , 2- , and 3-@xmath4 scatter , based on the objects that have similar magnitudes to the haes ( dots ) ,",

    "one of them is indeed the object just south of the eastern clump .",
    "we confirm that the offset of the emission - line gas is not due to poor astrometric alignment of the two images ; all the other objects adjacent to the eastern clump show the same scatter shown as dots here .    the @xmath10-band light centroid can be considered the center - of - mass for each galaxy .",
    "therefore , these offsets of the h@xmath0 emission indicate that the star - formation is occurring at the periphery of the galaxies",
    ". this could be due to interactions among the galaxies triggering star - formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , though the apparent alignment of the offset direction is difficult to explain .",
    "the apparent offset of the h@xmath0 emission is roughly @xmath142 , corresponding to a physical size of @xmath143  kpc at @xmath5 .",
    "another possible explanation may be that vast outflows of emission - line gas are being launched from these galaxies .",
    "the direction of such outflows could be influenced by the direction that the group is moving towards the center of the cluster potential .",
    "if the cluster potential is already filled by dense intracluster gas , the expelled emission - line gas from these galaxies may leave a `` wake '' behind each galaxy . in the local universe ,",
    "similarly offset light from emission - line gas is caused by ram - pressure stripping of galaxies by intracluster gas ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , @xcite discovered a trail of blue emission - line knots behind an object in abell2667 at @xmath144 .",
    "our detected offset of the h@xmath0 emission in the eastern clump may be similar .",
    "a detection of extended x - ray emission from 4c  23.56 intracluster gas is the key for falsifying the ram - pressure stripping scenario .",
    "the field was observed by _",
    "xmm _ and reported by @xcite . though they detected extended soft x - ray emission near the radio galaxy in a @xmath145 ksec epic exposures , they concluded that inverse - compton scattering of cmb photons is the most likely emission mechanism .",
    "indeed the position and direction of the x - ray extension is well aligned with the radio lobe which extends @xmath146 mpc north - east / south - west from the radio galaxy , and not with the direction where the eastern clump lies . for now , there is no evidence of thermal x - ray emission from hot intracluster gas .      _",
    "spitzer _ mips @xmath6 imaging has been used to probe star formation activity at z@xmath1472 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "the @xmath6 photometry and the inferred star - formation rates for the hae counterparts are separately discussed in the next section (  3.5 ) . to estimate the density excess of mips sources quantitatively",
    ", we have to consider the difference of the exposure coverage across the field .",
    "we first exclude any area that has exposure time less than @xmath148 of the total integration .",
    "we then set the sextractor object detection threshold to @xmath149 .",
    "this is higher than usual so that the detection is not affected by the s / n difference due to the variation of exposure time across the field . to check the robustness of the detection threshold",
    "further , we reversed the pixel count of the mips image and executed the object detection with the same sextractor parameters .",
    "besides a clear pixel defect , we detected no sources in the inverse image , indicating that the no fake object from the sky variation is included in the current analysis . furthermore , we exclude all objects with flux density less than @xmath150 , as they may suffer from the source confusion in crowded regions .",
    "we also introduce an upper flux density cut of @xmath151 because most of our haes are fainter than @xmath152 . any object much brighter than @xmath152 has a high possibility of being in the foreground .",
    "the upper flux density cut is chosen to be roughly twice the median @xmath6 flux density of our haes .",
    "note that we apply the sextractor detection directly to the @xmath6 data for the source density excess estimate . for the sfr estimate from the mips photometry for our hae sample we use daophot software as",

    "the resulting density map of the faint ( @xmath153jy ) mips sources is overlaid on fig.[fig13 ] as contours .",
    "the distribution of sources has been smoothed by a gaussian kernel of @xmath154 . for reference ,",
    "the position of the haes are shown as red open circles .",
    "it is quite clear that the mips source density excess closely matches the hae distribution .    to quantify the density excess of mips sources further",

    "on the other hand , we count 39 objects in the `` excess region '' , yielding a number enhancement of @xmath156 .",
    "this corresponds to a 4.5-@xmath4 excess by proper poisson statistics @xcite . as a crosscheck , we downloaded the deep mips data for goods - n / s fields and counted sources in the same manner , yielding the expected count of @xmath157 for an area with the size of the ' ' excess region \" .",
    "the source counts of deep mips data for elais - n1 field by @xcite also shows the expected number of 17.0 .",
    "our number is consistent with those surveys , considering the uncertainty by the cosmic variation .",
    "the haes with mips counterparts ( 9 ) can only explain less than half of the total excess count ( @xmath158 ) .",
    "this implies that our shallow h@xmath0 emitter survey may be missing an even larger number of the dust - enshrouded star - forming objects in the excess region .",
    "future follow - up observations using alma etc would be quite interesting to understand these hidden dusty sources .      in this section",
    "we estimate the star - formation rate ( sfr ) and the stellar mass of our hae sample .",
    "we note , however , that the estimation of the sfrs and the stellar masses for our hae sample are uncertain and should be treated with caution .",
    "it is known that dust absorption lowers the measured sfr from h@xmath0 emission relative to the intrinsic sfr based on radio or fir emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the contamination of the [ n ] 6583  emission line to the narrowband flux is also an unknown factor ( here we set the factor as 0.2 ) .",
    "the contribution of agn to the ionizing radiation also adds uncertainty to the estimate .",
    "these uncertainties can be calibrated using future deep spectroscopy of complete hae samples .",
    "@xcite gives the conversion formula from @xmath159 to the sfr as follows .",

    "note that the dust extinction should affect the sfr estimate much more than the uncertainty due to [ n ] contamination .",
    "an agn contribution can also exist for some galaxies ; the unusually high derived sfr for 4c  23.56 is clearly due to the agn contribution to the h@xmath0 flux .    as for the extinction - correction factor ,",
    "the @xmath132 diagram ( fig.[fig3]a ) is a useful diagnostic for a part of our sample . in the figure",
    "we show the a@xmath161 extinction vector using the @xcite extinction law . assuming that the objects are pure disks with dust extinction",
    ", the color distribution of the haes indicates that the level of the extinction ranges from 0 to @xmath162 . using the @xcite recipe and the conversion of a@xmath163a@xmath164 , an extinction correction factor of 1 to 5",

    "the bolometric infrared luminosity of galaxies correlates very well with other measures of the star - formation rate and may be the most robust measurement of the sfr . the infrared light is emitted by dust - reprocessing of the emitted uv light from young stars and therefore peaks at rest - frame wavelengths between 100 and 300  @xmath50 m . in lieu of observations at these frequencies ,",
    "the longest wavelength datapoints need to be extrapolated using assumed sed models . for this radio galaxy field",
    "we have used the observed @xmath167 m imaging to infer the sfrs for the discovered h@xmath0 emitters .",

    "finally , we use the @xcite @xmath169 to sfr conversion below , @xmath170 note that the original formula is divided by 1.5 for @xcite imf @xcite .",
    "these conversions and extrapolation result in sfrs which are uncertain by up to factors of a few @xcite . for our purposes , to estimate the fir output from likely protocluster galaxies , these uncertainties are tolerable .",

    "there are differences in the properties of the haes in the pks  1138 - 262 and the 4c  23.56 protoclusters , primarily the spatial distribution of the haes relative to the radio galaxies . in the pks  1138 - 262 system",
    "the haes are rather homogeneously distributed around the radio galaxy , with some evidence for higher surface density closer to it . in the 4c  23.56 field",
    "the radio galaxy lies at the western edge of the hae distribution .",
    "this does not appear to be a result of observational bias as described in  2.1.1 and  3.2 .",
    "this may imply a different evolutionary future of the host galaxy of each radio source .",
    "for example , the pks  1138 - 262 host may evolve into the centrally - dominant cd - like galaxy relatively early while the 4c  23.56 host may remain one of several dominant galaxies until they merge into a single larger galaxy at the center of the potential .",
    "the host of 4c  23.56 is indeed @xmath217 magnitudes less luminous in @xmath35 than the pks  1138 host ( @xmath218 after removing nuclear component and emission - line contribution ; @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath218 magnitude for the host of pks  1138 is unusual ; its apparent magnitude is as bright as the brightest cluster galaxies at @xmath219  @xcite . if we use formula ( [ eq6 ] ) in  3.5.3 , the stellar mass of the 4c  23.56 and the pks",
    "1138 hosts are estimated to be @xmath220m@xmath221 and @xmath222m@xmath221 , respectively . for comparison , @xcite estimated the stellar mass of both host galaxies based on their _ spitzer _ multi - band photometry , finding @xmath223m@xmath221 and @xmath224m@xmath221 , for 4c  23.56 and pks  1138 respectively .",
    "another difference is in the number of haes with strong ( ew@xmath225   ) emission . in the 4c  23.56 field ,",
    "10 of 11 haes have rest - frame ew@xmath225   . in the pks",
    "1138 field the number of objects that satisfy ew@xmath225     and nb@xmath226@xmath227 is 5 .",
    "as the equivalent width relates to the h@xmath0 luminosity , the excess number of strong ew objects in the 4c  23.56 field implies more active star formation occurring in that protocluster",
    ". we will address this quite interesting topic more in the next section .",
    "recently , @xcite reported an excess of [ o ] emitters in the field of the distant x - ray cluster xmmxcs  j2215.9 - 1738 at @xmath17 . the distribution of [ o ] emitters are prevalent from the outskirt to the core region of the x - ray cluster .",
    "they showed that the fraction of the [ o ] emitters among all cluster members as well as the level of the star - formation are shown to be both nearly constant as a function of clustercentric radius ( see also , @xcite ) .",
    "their figs.5 - 7 indicate that the distribution of the emitters well traces the overall distribution of all cluster members .",
    "the distribution of h@xmath0 emitters in @xcite also closely matches the photo - z - selected galaxy distribution as shown by their fig.6 @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that the case of the cluster xmmxcs  j2215.9 - 1738 may not be the representative as a cluster at @xmath228 .",
    "@xcite has shown that the system has a possible bimodal kinematic structure , with the position of the cluster bcg significantly offseted from the center of the thermal hot x - ray gas . and also ,",
    "the nb hae survey for another cluster xmmu  j2235.3 - 2557 at @xmath229 by @xcite has show that the hae distribution just avoids the central @xmath230 kpc of the cluster core ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "although we are still not sure about whether the hae can trace the overall distribution of cluster galaxies from the core to the outskirts at @xmath231 universe , both studies could consider the supporting case that the distribution of haes in the 4c  23.56 protocluster also traces the underlying galaxy distribution .",
    "future analysis based on the broadband imaging will enable us to address the issue .",
    "@xcite contrast the activity of galaxies in the cluster core region by comparing to similar work for a @xmath232 cluster by @xcite . at even lower redshift , @xcite studied the hae distribution for cl  0024 + 1652 at @xmath233 , showing quite strong suppression of activity in the cluster core region .",
    "it is quite interesting to connect the results by these works from @xmath233  @xcite , @xmath232  @xcite , @xmath234  @xcite , @xmath235  @xcite , to our @xmath137 studies as a snapshot of the cluster evolution in each epoch @xcite . the implied rise of star - formation activity in the cluster core with redshift and its variety suggests that , while it may indicate that we are gradually approaching the era of galaxy formation for members in the cluster core @xcite , it is important to evaluate the physical state ( richness , dynamics , mass etc . ) for each protoclusters in detail to draw a general pictures of early history of galaxy evolution in cluster core .",
    "the detailed studies of larger samples are clearly needed to corroborate this apparent evolutionary trend .      in  3.5",
    "we calculate the sfr and the stellar mass of our hae sample .",
    "although we admit that the estimate of these values is rather crude , here we try to characterize the star - formation of the haes in 4c  23.56 field by comparing them to the other studies .",
    "as is discussed in  3.5 , the main uncertainty for h@xmath0-based sfr is in the estimate of the dust extinction , as indicated by the mips detection .",
    "the unknown fraction of the agn contribution to our hae sample ( it can be non - negligible : see @xcite ) is also an issue we need to address by the future observation . in figure  [ fig9]a",
    ", we plot the estimated star - formation rate of our haes against their stellar mass .",
    "the minimum sfr in our sample is @xmath236 , with a median value of 45 ( 182 for extinction corrected , 746 for mips ) @xmath237 . in the figure ,",
    "the brightest object with the highest sfr , is 4c  23.56 ( note that the mass estimate for this object is probably overestimated , not only due to the inclusion of agn but also due to the effect of the poor sky subtraction : see  2.1 ) .",
    "the line on the figure is the average mass - sfr relation for @xmath8 bzk - selected galaxies with mips detections by @xcite .",
    "the sfrs based on both indicators show larger values than expected from the @xmath8 mass - sfr relation by @xcite .",
    "especially , the mips - based sfr shows large excess .",
    "this trend seems real , because our mips - based sfr is derived from the same equation as used by @xcite .",
    "this may indicate that some galaxies in the protocluster 4c 23.56 have higher star - formation activity than the field counterparts with similar mass .",
    "the observed large excess of the @xmath238-based sfr relative to @xmath239-based one may indicate that the star - formation activity in our hae sample is largely ( or selectively ) hidden by dust . at lower redshifts such hidden star - formation activity revealed by infrared observation is often reported ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , the recent calibration of the mips @xmath238-based sfr for star - forming galaxies at @xmath8 by the _ herschel _",
    "pacs observation has revealed that the sfrs from @xmath238 alone could be overestimated by a factor of @xmath240 @xcite .",
    "our observed trend can be due to the large systematics in the estimate of the total infrared luminosity from the rest - frame @xmath241 photometry .",
    "for now we do not know whether the haes in the 4c 23.56 field harbours the star - formation significantly hidden by dust .",
    "the direct far - infrared observation by alma will address the issue .    in fig.[fig9]b",
    "we show the l(h@xmath0)-based specific star - formation rate ( ssfr ) as a function of stellar mass . for comparison , we plot the ssfr values for field h@xmath0 emitters from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the @xcite points include two types of the extinction correction , which is shown as connected points with vertical lines in the figure , while @xcite used the correction ( described above ) which could be considered the middle between the two extreme cases from @xcite .",
    "the measured relation between ssfr and mass deviates clearly from that observed in similar studies of low redshift clusters .",
    "for example , @xcite measured the sfr and ssfr of a rich cluster at @xmath242 from mips - based photometry , and confirmed that the ssfr of massive ( log  @xmath243 ) galaxies in high density regions is as low as for field objects with similar mass in local universe . also at @xmath244 ,",
    "the ssfr estimate of the member galaxies in the irregular cluster cl 0332 - 2742 at @xmath245 by @xcite show that significant member galaxies have much lower ssfr than field counterparts at similar redshifts , despite that the system is quite irregular and far from a virialized structure .",
    "recently , @xcite studied galaxies in the protocluster around pks  1138 at @xmath9 and showed a similar trend of the suppressed star - formation activity in the cluster compared to the field environment ( see also , @xcite ) .",
    "these studies may indicate that the star - formation activity in cluster environment is suppressed up to @xmath8 .    to avoid the uncertainties introduced by estimating the sfr and the stellar mass",
    ", we also compare the star - formation rates directly using the observed values . in figure  [ fig11 ]",
    "we show the observed @xmath10-band magnitude versus the h@xmath0 luminosity ( @xmath246h@xmath0 ) ) of the same dataset as shown in fig.[fig9]b , but limited to objects at @xmath11 . here",
    "the data from @xcite is also added for comparison . within the uncertainties ,",
    "all haes in the 4c  23.56 field are clearly as luminous as the brightest h@xmath0 sample in the general field results , again suggesting an excess of active star formation in the 4c  23.56 field . perhaps more interestingly , in fig.[fig11 ]",
    "we compare the haes in the 4c  23.56 field with the pks  1138 field data .",
    "the majority of haes in the pks  1138 protocluster have lower h@xmath0 luminosities than both field objects and the haes in 4c  23.56 despite being within a similar @xmath10 magnitude range .",
    "it indicates that the haes in the pks  1138 field show suppressed star formation .",
    "this is actually the same conclusion reached by @xcite , but their work is based on broadband sed fitting , i.e. , from an independent measure .",
    "the cosmic time between the two protoclusters is only 0.4  gyr .",
    "this is actually long enough to discern changes of the star - formation activity if their star - formation timescale is short .",
    "@xcite suggest that the star - formation timescale for galaxies in the pks  1138 field is much shorter than for galaxies with similar mass in the goods fields .",
    "their figure  13 demonstrates the rapid decline of the sfr in the protocluster compared to that of goods , and shows that the time difference of 0.4 gyr is long enough to observe the decline .",
    "for example , if we suppose that these star - forming galaxies in protoclusters are formed at @xmath247 , the increase of the star - formation rate between @xmath9 to 2.5 ( 0.4 gyr ) is close to an order of magnitude .    this argument",
    "could of course be too simplified , as it assumes that any galaxies in the two clusters have almost the same formation period around @xmath247 .",
    "the actual formation of massive galaxies in the cluster environment could be much more complicated , and it could be coupled with the fundamental cluster properties ( mass , merger history , dynamical state , and so on ) .",
    "as we already discussed , the difference of the star - formation activity between the two protoclusters might be related to the different inherent cluster characteristics .",
    "the pks  1138 host is exceptionally massive and already lies near the apparent center of the galaxy distribution @xcite , while the 4c  23.56 host lies at the edge of the hae ( and presumably overall galaxy ) distribution (  3.2 &  4.2 ) .",
    "the soft x - ray emission from the hot intracluster gas is ( marginally ) detected in pks  1138 @xcite , while for 4c  23.56 it is not @xcite",
    ". the future of the pks  1138 protocluster may well be an x - ray bright , well evolved rich cluster with a massive cd galaxy lying in the center , while that of 4c  23.56 might be an x - ray faint cluster with a few dominant giant ellipticals near the center of the potential , such as the coma or virgo clusters .",
    "we have discovered a significant excess of near - infrared selected emission - line objects around the radio galaxy 4c  23.56 at @xmath248 . we detect 11 robust emission - line galaxies with a line flux greater than @xmath114 in our moircs imaging observation of the @xmath249 field around the radio galaxy .",
    "we show that this is a significantly higher ( 5 times more ) detection rate compared to other near - infrared emission - line surveys in non - radio - galaxy fields .",
    "three of the emission - line galaxies are found to have a spectroscopic redshift of @xmath5 .",
    "we therefore conclude there is a protocluster physically associated with 4c  23.56 .",
    "the distribution of haes on the sky is confined to a relatively small area ( @xmath250mpc - radius region ) near the radio galaxy , with 4c  23.56 placed at the western edge .",
    "we show that this is not due to observational bias , and conclude that the protocluster is physically associated with the radio galaxy .",
    "the offset position of the radio galaxy is interesting , because the hosts of powerful radio galaxies are usually very massive and often assumed to be the dominant object ( e.g. , cd galaxy ) in the center of the cluster .",
    "we also find that there is an interesting compact group of four haes , all the members of which show offset h@xmath0 emission relative to the @xmath251-band light position .",
    "this may indicate strong star - formation on the edge of each galaxy which is occurring due to strong interactions with the group .",
    "a more exotic interpretation might be that there is ram - pressure stripping of the galactic - scale h@xmath0-emitting gas by the hot intracluster gas .",
    "further follow - up is necessary to understand the phenomenon .    our analysis of deep _ spitzer _ mips @xmath6 data for 4c  23.56 shows that all but two of the haes have 24@xmath252 counterparts .",
    "the inferred star - formation rate ( sfr ) based on the mips 24@xmath252 photometry is quite high ( median of @xmath253 ) , indicating that intense starburst activity is going on in each hae .",
    "the mips - based sfr is on average 3.5 times higher than the value inferred from the observed h@xmath0 luminosity .",
    "the strong effect of `` selective '' dust extinction is evident for these galaxies , implying the metal - rich and evolved populations for haes , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the spatial distribution of the mips sources has also revealed that there exists a strong excess around 4c  23.56 .",
    "notably , the distribution of sources that have @xmath6 fluxes as faint as the haes ( @xmath254 ) shows the same offset distribution relative to the radio galaxy , and the position of the density peak nicely coincides with the hae distribution .",
    "this is another indication that the strong star - formation activity is going on in the protocluster .",
    "the comparison of the star - formation rates of haes in the protocluster 4c  23.56 at @xmath43 to those in another protocluster pks  1138 - 262 at @xmath9 and to those in the general field at @xmath8 shows that : ( 1 ) haes in the 4c  23.56 field are as active as those in the general field , and that ( 2 ) haes in the protocluster pks  1138 - 262 show a clear _ deficit _ of objects with high h@xmath0 luminosities . the clear difference in star forming activities between the two protoclusters at similar redshifts",
    "may indicate that we are stepping into the epoch of major star formation in massive cluster galaxies .",
    "given the fact that there is a small but significant time difference of 0.4  gyr between the two redshifts , such variation in star formation activity may be interpreted as a time evolution where star formation activities to form massive galaxies can decay rather sharply during this epoch ( @xmath255 ) in proto - clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , we may be just seeing the intrinsic scatter of cluster properties at this high redshift where the onset of cluster formation and the subsequent evolution depend on the mass of the systems and/or structures in the surrounding environment .",
    "such dependence is actually inferred in lower - redshift clusters at @xmath14 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , we do not know yet the global properties of these protoclusters , such as total number of member galaxies , cluster masses , and the dynamical states , nor do we yet have a statistical sample of protoclusters at this interesting redshift regime to disentangle these two effects . we are desperate to obtain such information by extensive near - infrared spectroscopy and to increase the sample of proto - clusters at @xmath11 .",

    "<S> we report the discovery of a significant excess of candidate h@xmath0 emitters ( haes ) in the field of the radio galaxy 4c  23.56 at @xmath1 . using the moircs near - infrared imager on the subaru telescope we found 11 candidate emission - line galaxies to a flux limit of @xmath2 , which is about 5 times excess from the expected field counts with @xmath3-@xmath4 significance . </S>",
    "<S> three of these are spectroscopically confirmed as redshifted h@xmath0 at @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of candidate emitters on the sky is tightly confined to a 1.2-mpc - radius area at @xmath5 , locating 4c 23.56 at the western edge of the distribution . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of the deep _ spitzer _ mips @xmath6 imaging shows that there is also an excess of faint mips sources . </S>",
    "<S> all but two of the 11 haes are also found in the mips data . </S>",
    "<S> the inferred star - formation rate ( sfr ) of the haes based on the extinction - corrected h@xmath0 luminosity ( median sfr @xmath7 ) is similar to those of haes in random fields at @xmath8 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the mips - based sfr for the haes is on average 3.6 times larger , suggesting the existence of the star - formation significanly obscured by dust . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of the h@xmath0-based star - formation activities of the haes in the 4c  23.56 field to those in another proto - cluster around pks  1138 - 262 at @xmath9 reveals that the latter tend to have fainter h@xmath0 emission despite similar @xmath10-band magnitudes . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that star - formation may be suppressed in the pks  1138 - 262 protocluster relative to the 4c  23.56 protocluster . </S>",
    "<S> this difference among the haes in the two proto - clusters at @xmath11 may imply that some massive cluster galaxies are just forming at these epochs with some variation among clusters . </S>"
