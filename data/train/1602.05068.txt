    "integrating over the quark - pair degrees of freedom we reduce the baryon to a quark - diquark system , where the diquark can be represented as an on - mass - shell spectator particle with an effective mass @xmath21  @xcite .    the electromagnetic interaction with the baryons",

    "when the nucleon wave function ( @xmath31 ) and the resonance wave function ( @xmath32 ) are both expressed in terms of the single quark and quark - pair states , the transition current is calculated in the relativistic impulse approximation , integrating over the diquark on - mass - shell momentum , and summing over the the intermediate diquark polarizations  @xcite . in the study of inelastic transitions we use the landau prescription to ensure the conservation of the transition current  @xcite .    using the relativistic impulse approximation",

    "there are however some processes such as the meson exchanged between the different quarks inside the baryon , which can not be reduced to simple diagrams with quark dressing .",
    "those processes are regarded as arising from a meson exchanged between the different quarks inside the baryon and can be classified as meson cloud corrections to the hadronic reactions  @xcite . in some cases",
    "one can use the covariant spectator quark model to infer the effect of the meson cloud effects based on empirical information or lattice qcd simulations  @xcite .",
    "we discuss now the @xmath0 transitions , where @xmath1 is the nucleon state and @xmath2 is a radial excitation of the nucleon based on a @xmath42-state wave function .",
    "we are excluding where the @xmath43 @xmath2 states based on spin - isospin wave functions with mixed symmetry . the @xmath2 state share then with the nucleon , the structure of spin and isospin , and differ only in the radial structure ( radial wave function @xmath36 ) .",

    "one can interpret the approximated convergence of results for large @xmath14 as a consequence of the correlations between the excited radial wave functions and the nucleon radial wave function  @xcite .    since the _ equivalent _ amplitude @xmath8 for the nucleon is known already for very large @xmath14 ( using the @xmath71 data ) , this result can be compared with the estimates of the amplitudes for the @xmath53 and @xmath3 systems , for very large @xmath14 , as presented in fig .",

    "it is worth to mention that our calculations are consistent with others estimates based on the assumption of the second nucleon radial excitation , where @xmath76 and @xmath77  @xcite .",
    "the signs , and magnitudes of the data , are however consistent with the estimates of the hypercentral quark model  @xcite .    from the theoretical point of view",
    "there are other possible interpretations for the @xmath3 state .",
    "although the interpretation of the states from the third resonance region based on the quark structure are partially tentative , the state @xmath3 can be interpreted as an excitation associated with a state with mixed symmetry  @xcite .",
    "several other suggestions have been made for the composition of the @xmath3 state , such as the mixture of states @xmath78 , the mixture @xmath79 , a @xmath80 state , where @xmath81 represent a vibrational state of the @xmath82 , and even a @xmath83 mixture , where @xmath84 is a gluon  @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that @xmath3 is a dynamically generated resonance as suggested by ref .",

    "finally in the interacting quark diquark model the @xmath3 is described as a quark - axial diquark system in a relative @xmath42-wave configuration .",
    "the prediction of the mass is respectively , 1640 mev in the non relativistic version of the model  @xcite and 1776 mev in the relativistic version of the same model  @xcite .",
    "contrarily to the nucleon and the @xmath53 that are part of the @xmath4-multiplet @xmath85 $ ] , the @xmath3 state is more frequently associated with the multiplet @xmath86 $ ]  @xcite . in those conditions",
    "the second radial excitation of the nucleon should correspond to an higher mass resonance .",
    "the state @xmath87 listed by the particle data group ( pdg )  @xcite is at the moment the best candidate . within the quark models it is interesting to note that hypercentral quark model is the only model which admits two radial excitations of the nucleon belonging to @xmath85 $ ] multiplets  @xcite .",

    "the sqtm can be used to parametrize the transition current between two multiplets , in an operational form that includes only four independent terms , with coefficients exclusively dependent of @xmath14 .",
