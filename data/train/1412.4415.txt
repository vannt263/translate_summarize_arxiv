    "there is considerable interest in the study of equations of the form @xmath3 that describe breaking waves . in this paper",
    "we consider the equation @xmath4 with parameters @xmath5 ( not all zero ) and @xmath6 .",
    "this 4-parameter family contains several integrable equations . for @xmath7 and @xmath8 , equation reduces respectively to the camassa - holm equation @xcite @xmath9 and the degasperis - procesi equation @xcite @xmath10 while for @xmath11 , equation becomes the novikov equation @xcite @xmath12 the three equations , , are integrable in the sense of having a lax pair , a bi - hamiltonian structure , as well as hierarchies of local symmetries and local conservation laws , and they also possess peaked travelling wave solutions .",
    "in addition to these integrable equations , many other non - integrable equations that admit breaking waves are included in the 4-parameter family .",
    "for instance , there is the @xmath13-equation @xmath14 which unifies the camassa - holm and degasperis - procesi equations @xcite .",
    "there is also a modified version of the @xmath13-equation @xcite @xmath15 which includes the novikov equation .",
    "no other cases of the two equations and are known to be integrable @xcite .    an equivalent form of the 4-parameter equation is given by @xmath16 in terms of the momentum variable @xmath17 with parameters @xmath18 this parametric equation is invariant under the group of scaling transformations @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 with @xmath22 .    in section  [ conslaws ] , we classify the low - order conservation laws of equation and show that the hamiltonians of the camassa - holm and novikov equations are admitted as local conservation laws by equation if and only if @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we consider peaked travelling waves in section  [ peakons ] and use a weak formulation of equation to show that single peakon and multi - peakon solutions are admitted if and only if @xmath23 and @xmath25 when @xmath26 .",
    "we derive the explicit equations of motion for @xmath27 peakon / anti - peakon solutions and also obtain the constants of motion inherited from the local conservation laws of equation .    in section  [ unifiedeqn ] ,",
    "we combine the previous results to obtain a natural 1-parameter family of equations @xmath28 given by @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , where a scaling transformation @xmath29 is used to put @xmath30 .",
    "since this 1-parameter family unifies the camassa - holm and novikov equations , we will refer to it as the _ gchn equation_. ( similar unified equations have been considered previously from related perspectives @xcite . ) we then discuss some general features of the dynamics of its @xmath31 peakon / anti - peakon solutions and we show that wave - breaking occurs for certain solutions describing collisions between peakons and anti - peakons in the case @xmath2 .",
    "finally , in section  [ remarks ] , we make some concluding remarks including a possible scenario for wave - breaking in the cauchy problem for weak solutions .",
    "for the 4-parameter equation , a _ local conservation law _",
    "@xcite is a space - time divergence @xmath32 holding for all solutions @xmath33 of equation , where the _ conserved density _ @xmath34 and the _ spatial flux _",
    "@xmath35 are functions of @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and derivatives of @xmath38 .",
    "the spatial integral of the conserved density @xmath34 satisfies @xmath39 and so if the flux @xmath35 vanishes at spatial infinity , then @xmath40= \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } t dx=\\const\\ ] ] formally yields a conserved quantity for equation .",
    "conversely , any such conserved quantity arises from a local conservation law .",
    "if the conserved quantity is purely a boundary term , then the local conservation law is called _",
    "trivial_. this occurs when ( and only when ) the conserved density is a total @xmath37-derivative and the flux is a total @xmath36-derivative , related by @xmath41 for all solutions @xmath33 of equation , where @xmath42 is some function of @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and derivatives of @xmath38 .",
    "two local conservation laws are _ equivalent _ if they differ by a trivial conservation law , thereby giving the same conserved quantity up to boundary terms .",
    "the set of all conservation laws ( up to equivalence ) admitted by equation forms a vector space on which there is a natural action @xcite by the group of all lie symmetries of the equation .    for conserved densities and fluxes depending on at most @xmath43 , a conservation law can be expressed in an equivalent form by a divergence identity @xmath44 where @xmath45 is called the _ multiplier_. this identity  is called the _",
    "characteristic equation _",
    "@xcite for the conserved density and flux . by balancing the highest order @xmath36-derivative terms @xmath46 on both sides of the equation",
    ", we directly find that @xmath47 and @xmath48 . then balancing the terms @xmath49",
    ", we see that @xmath50 .",
    "hence the conserved density and the flux in the divergence identity must have the form @xmath51 its multiplier thus has the form @xmath52    in general , the differential order of a local conservation law is defined to be the smallest differential order among all equivalent conserved densities .",
    "a local conservation law is said to be of _ low order _ if the differential orders of @xmath34 and @xmath35 are both strictly less than the differential order of the equation .    consequently , conserved densities and fluxes of the form comprise all possible low - order conservation laws of equation .",
    "the problem of finding all low - order conservations then reduces to the simpler problem of finding all low - order multipliers .",
    "since equation is an evolution equation , it has no lagrangian formulation in terms of the variable @xmath38 .",
    "in this situation , the problem of finding multipliers can be understood as a kind of adjoint @xcite of the problem of finding symmetries .",
    "an _ infinitesimal symmetry _",
    "@xcite of equation is a generator @xmath53 whose coefficient @xmath54 is given by a function of @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and derivatives of @xmath38 , such that the prolonged generator satisfies the invariance condition @xmath55 holding for all solutions @xmath33 of equation .",
    "the lie symmetry group of equation is generated by infinitesimal symmetries with coefficients of the form @xmath56 if @xmath54 is at most linear in @xmath57 and @xmath58 , then the resulting generator will yield a group of point transformations @xcite , whereas if @xmath54 is nonlinear in @xmath57 or @xmath58 , then a group of contact transformations @xcite will be generated .",
    "hence , all generators of lie symmetries admitted by equation are determined by the solutions of condition for @xmath59 .",
    "( it is straightforward to solve this determining equation by maple to classify the lie symmetry group of equation , as shown in the appendix . )",
    "the condition for determining all multipliers @xmath60 of low - order conservation laws admitted by equation consists of @xmath61 which arises from the property that the variational derivative ( euler operator ) @xmath62 annihilates an expression identically iff it is a space - time divergence @xcite",
    ". this condition can be split with respect to @xmath63 and @xmath64-derivatives of @xmath63 , yielding an equivalent overdetermined system of equations on @xmath65 .",
    "one equation in this system is given by the adjoint of the symmetry determining equation , @xmath66 holding for all solutions @xmath33 of equation .",
    "solutions @xmath65 of this equation are called _ adjoint - symmetries _ ( or _ cosymmetries _ ) @xcite .",
    "the remaining equations in the system comprise helmholtz conditions which are necessary and sufficient for @xmath65 to have the form . as a consequence ,",
    "multipliers are simply adjoint - symmetries that have a certain variational form .",
    "for any solution of the multiplier determining equation , a corresponding conserved density and flux of the form can be recovered either through integration @xcite of the characteristic equation , which splits with respect to @xmath67 , @xmath63 , @xmath68 , @xmath49 into a system of equations for @xmath34 and @xmath35 , or through a homotopy integral formula @xcite , which expresses @xmath34 and @xmath35 directly in terms of @xmath69 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath34 and @xmath35 have the form of a trivial conservation law iff @xmath70 .",
    "thus there is a one - to - one correspondence between equivalence classes of non - trivial low - order conservation laws and non - zero low - order multipliers .",
    "both the camassa - holm equation and novikov equation possess low - order local conservations law given by the conserved densities @xcite @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively , for the two equations .",
    "in addition , the camassa - holm equation itself is a low - order local conservation law having the conserved density @xmath74 all of these conserved densities are related to hamiltonian structures for the two equations @xcite .",
    "the corresponding multipliers are respectively given by @xmath75    to look for conserved densities of the same form for equation , we now classify all multipliers up to 1st - order @xmath76 as well as all 2nd - order multipliers with the specific form @xmath77 in each case it is straightforward to solve the determining equation by use of maple ( as shown in the appendix ) , which leads to the following classification result .",
    "[ class - loworderq ] ( i ) equation admits 0th - order multipliers only in the following cases : @xmath78 ( ii ) for any @xmath6 and any @xmath79 , equation admits no 1st - order multipliers .",
    "( iii ) equation admits 2nd - order multipliers of the form only in the following cases : @xmath80    in light of the adjoint relationship between multipliers and symmetries , the classification of 0th- and 1st- order multipliers in proposition  [ class - loworderq ] is a counterpart of the classification of lie symmetries ( cf .",
    "proposition  [ class - pointsymm ] ) .",
    "next we obtain the corresponding conserved densities and fluxes for each multiplier  by first splitting the characteristic equation with respect to @xmath67 , @xmath63 , @xmath68 , @xmath49 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 have the form , and then integrating the resulting system of equations .",
    "this yields the following low - order local conservation laws for equation .",
    "[ class - lowordertx ] ( i ) the local conservation laws admitted by the wave - breaking equation with multipliers of at most 1st - order consist of three 0th - order conservation laws @xmath81 and two 1st - order conservation laws @xmath82 ( ii ) the local conservation laws admitted by the wave - breaking equation with 2nd - order multipliers of the form consist of two 2nd - order conservation laws @xmath83 in these conservation laws  , any terms of the form @xmath84 in the case @xmath85 should be replaced by @xmath86 .",
    "these conservation laws yield the following conserved integrals .",
    "we start with the conservation laws at 0th order . from @xmath87 , we have @xmath88 which is the conserved mass for equation .",
    "the conserved integral arising from @xmath89 is a weighted mass , @xmath90 interestingly , from @xmath91 we get a conserved integral which vanishes , but has a non - zero spatial flux .",
    "this type of conservation law arises because the multiplier converts equation into the form of a total @xmath37-derivative .",
    "next we look at the conservation laws at 1st order . from @xmath92 , the @xmath0 norm of @xmath33",
    "is conserved , @xmath93 from @xmath94 , we have @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the center of mass of @xmath33 .",
    "since @xmath97 is conserved , it can be evaluated at @xmath98 , which yields the relation @xmath99 .",
    "this shows that the center of mass moves at a constant speed controlled by the @xmath0 norm of @xmath33 .    finally , we consider the conservation laws at 2nd order . from @xmath100 ,",
    "we get @xmath101 this shows that the @xmath102 norm of @xmath103 is conserved if @xmath104 does not change sign or if @xmath105 is an even integer .",
    "the conserved integral arising from @xmath106 is a linear combination of the @xmath107 norms of @xmath108 as given by @xmath109 this can be written alternatively as a weighted @xmath110 norm when @xmath111 .",
    "it is interesting to note that simultaneous conservation of both the @xmath0 and the weighted @xmath110 norms requires the condition @xmath112 which holds iff @xmath113 and @xmath114 , but in this case @xmath115 .",
    "both the camassa - holm and novikov equations possess peaked travelling wave solutions @xcite , called peakons , @xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath72 , respectively , for the two equations .",
    "peakons have attracted much attention in the study of breaking wave equations .    in general , on @xmath118 ,",
    "a peakon is a weak travelling wave solution satisfying an integral ( i.e.  weak ) formulation of a breaking wave equation .",
    "such a formulation is essential for deriving multi - peakon solutions .",
    "however , single peakons can be derived directly from the travelling wave reduction of a breaking wave equation , which will be the approach we use here .",
    "the manifest invariance of the 4-parameter equation under time - translation and space - translation symmetries implies the existence of travelling wave solutions @xmath119 where @xmath120 satisfies the ode @xmath121    for the travelling wave ode , an integral formulation is obtained through multiplying this ode by a test function @xmath122 ( which is smooth and has compact support ) and integrating over @xmath123 , leaving at most first derivatives of @xmath124 in the integral , which yields @xmath125 a weak solution of ode is a function @xmath120 that belongs to the sobolev space @xmath126 and that satisfies the integral equation for all smooth test functions @xmath127 with compact support on @xmath128 .    to proceed we substitute a peaked travelling wave expression @xmath129 into equation and split up the integral into the intervals @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",

    "the peakon solution satisfies equation only in the sense of a weak solution .",

    "we now investigate whether equation also admits multi - peakon solutions .",
    "it will be convenient to use the notation @xmath161 where the summation is understood to go from @xmath162 to @xmath1 .",

    "to begin , we substitute the general multi - peakon expression into the integral equation .",
    "there are two ways we can then proceed .",
