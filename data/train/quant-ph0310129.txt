    "nonlinear optical devices such as optical parametric oscillators ( opo ) and optical parametric amplifiers ( opa ) @xcite have been studied in the last forty years for providing fundamental tests of quantum mechanics , as well as their technological applications in areas such as frequency conversion , low noise optical measurement , and cryptography .",
    "the light beams emitted by these devices are characterized by a large amount of squeezing @xcite , significant quantum intensity correlations @xcite , and very short correlation times between the conjugate beams @xcite .",
    "the entangled nature of the photons in the down converted light has been instrumental in providing experimental demonstrations@xcite of the original einstein - podolsky - rosen paradox and other nonclassical features of quantum mechanics . in this paper , we extend the usual linear theory of the nondegenerate opo to include nonlinear effects characteristic of the onset of critical fluctuations near threshold , which is the physical feature that ultimately limits the maximum squeezing and entanglement available .    as a fundamental application of these results ,",
    "we point out that in 1935 , einstein , podolsky and rosen  @xcite ( epr ) presented their famous argument which demonstrates that local realism is inconsistent with the completeness of quantum mechanics . their argument concerned two spatially separated particles with perfectly correlated positions and momenta , as predicted by quantum mechanics .",
    "related correlations for quadrature phase operators have been studied@xcite and experimentally confirmed for the output fields of the nondegenerate parametric oscillator , both below@xcite and above@xcite threshold .",
    "the regime of study of these correlations however has been so far confined to regimes of operation where the quantum fluctuations will be small so that a linearized analysis is valid .",
    "closely linked with the phenomenon of epr correlations is that of entanglement , a key feature enabling many potential applications in the field of quantum information .",
    "criteria for proving entanglement using continuous variable ( quadrature phase amplitude ) measurements have been developed by simon and duan et al@xcite .",
    "recent experiments@xcite have measured such continuous variable entanglement but again the studies are limited to the regime of stable , linearizable quantum fluctuations .",
    "in this regime gaussian statistics apply , and the criterion developed can be shown@xcite to be both a necessary and sufficient condition for entanglement in this case .",
    "it is known from earlier theoretical analysis @xcite of the optical properties of nonlinear crystals that , in the linearized or gaussian regime , a local realistic theory based on the wigner phase space representation gives the same results for the correlations between signal and idler light beams produced in nonlinear crystals@xcite . while this is also true of many correlations in second harmonic generation @xcite , there are instances where significant differences exist between the predictions of the two theories @xcite . here",
    "we calculate the epr and entanglement measures for non - gaussian fields , in precisely the type of environment where non - gaussian behavior is expected to occur experimentally - that is , by considering nonlinear corrections to the usual linearized approximations used to treat the opo below threshold .",
    "in two recent papers @xcite we have carried out a fully quantum mechanical analysis of nonlinear effects and critical fluctuations in a degenerate opo using the positive p - representation , and have investigated the squeezing spectra and triple correlations in this system both analytically as well as numerically . in particular , we have shown that , in this case , while the full quantum theory and the semi - classical theory disagree strongly far below threshold , there is a surprising agreement between the two close to the threshold where quantum fluctuations are quite intense , characteristic of a mixed state of light in this limit .",
    "the aim of the present work is to present a similar analysis for the case of a nondegenerate optical parametric oscillator .",
    "both the quantum mechanical and semi - classical analyses are carried out in parallel and are compared with exact numerical simulations .",
    "special attention is paid to the behavior of this system close to the critical point to ascertain the limits of entanglement , epr correlations and squeezing in this regime .",
    "we find that entanglement is optimised just below the critical point for output mode entanglement and squeezing , while the optimum internal squeezing and entanglement is achieved just above threshold .",
    "we consider here the standard model for three modes coupled by a nonlinear crystal inside a fabry - perot interferometer with allowance made for coherent pumping and damping due to cavity losses .",
    "this model implies certain restrictions on mode - spacing for its validity , since we assume only these three modes are excited .",
    "the heisenberg - picture hamiltonian that describes this open system is given by@xcite@xmath0 here @xmath1 represents the external input field at a frequency @xmath2 , with @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 represent the pump , the signal and the idler intra - cavity modes at frequencies @xmath2 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively , where @xmath8 .",
    "the terms @xmath9 represent reservoir operators and @xmath10 denotes the nonlinear coupling constant due to the second order polarizability of the nonlinear crystal .",
    "this is a driven system far from thermal equilibrium , so it is not appropriate to assume a canonical ensemble . instead",
    ", the density matrix must be calculated as the solution of a master equation in the schroedinger picture . for simplicity",
    ", we transform to a rotating frame in which the free - field time - evolution is removed . the master equation for the reduced density operator , obtained after the elimination of the reservoirs using standard techniques@xcite ,",

    "for simplicity , we assume that @xmath13 throughout this paper .",
    "to handle master equations such as this it proves convenient to transform them into c - number fokker - planck equations or equivalently into stochastic equations using operator representation theory . here , as in our earlier works",
    ", we use the positive p - representation for this purpose , and we also compare these results with the commonly used semiclassical truncation of the wigner representation .      the classical approximation , where all fluctuations are neglected , is obtained by simply assuming that all operator mean values factorize .",
    "this gives us the classical nonlinear - optical equations for @xmath14 in the form:@xmath15    for small driving fields , the stable classical below - threshold solutions are @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "there is a classical threshold or critical point at @xmath18 . above this threshold ,",
    "the driving field is clamped at @xmath19 , while the signal and idler intensities increase linearly with the input field @xmath20 .",
    "this paper deals with the near threshold and sub - threshold regime .      using the positive p - representation@xcite ,",
    "we can include correlations and fluctuations by expanding the density matrix describing the system in an off - diagonal coherent state basis as    @xmath21    where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are two independent triplets of complex variables .",
    "the function @xmath24 can be understood as a positive phase space distribution and , by virtue of @xmath25 , satisfies the following fokker - planck equation@xcite ( assuming that boundary terms vanish on partial integration):@xmath26\\right.\\nonumber \\\\   &   & + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\alpha_{0}^{+}}\\left[\\gamma_{0}\\alpha_{0}^{+}+\\chi\\alpha_{1}^{+}\\alpha_{2}^{+}-{\\mathcal{e}}\\right]\\nonumber \\\\   &   & + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\alpha_{1}}\\left[\\gamma_{1}\\alpha_{1}-\\chi\\alpha_{0}\\alpha_{2}^{+}\\right]+\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\alpha_{1}^{+}}\\left[\\gamma_{1}\\alpha_{1}^{+}-\\chi\\alpha_{0}^{+}\\alpha_{2}\\right]\\nonumber \\\\   &   & + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\alpha_{2}}\\left[\\gamma_{2}\\alpha_{2}-\\chi\\alpha_{0}\\alpha_{1}^{+}\\right]+\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\alpha_{2}^{+}}\\left[\\gamma_{2}\\alpha_{2}^{+}-\\chi\\alpha_{0}^{+}\\alpha_{1}\\right]\\nonumber \\\\   &   & \\left.+\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial\\alpha_{1}\\partial\\alpha_{2}}(\\chi\\alpha_{0})+\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial\\alpha_{1}^{+}\\partial\\alpha_{2}^{+}}(\\chi\\alpha_{0}^{+})\\right\\ } p_{+}(\\alpha,\\alpha^{+},t)\\,\\,.\\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we note here that boundary terms are found to be exponentially suppressed for large damping@xcite - ie , @xmath27 , which corresponds to typical experimental conditions for realistic opo s in current use .",
    "this can equivalently be written as the following set of it stochastic equations @xcite@xmath28    where @xmath29 with all other noise correlations vanishing .",
    "these equations imply that @xmath30 when there is no driving field , as physically expected for a vacuum state in a normally - ordered representation",
    ".    numerical simulations of these stochastic trajectories confirms the assumption of asymptotically vanishing boundary terms for the parameters we use , as the trajectories are strongly bounded to a compact domain . at smaller damping rates",
    ", it would become important to include stochastic gauge terms@xcite in the equations to eliminate boundary terms , but this was not found to be necessary in these calculations . in other words , while boundary terms are potentially present , the resulting errors are expected to be of order @xmath31 or smaller , which is completely negligible in typical quantum optical systems where @xmath32 .",
    "we can also transcribe the master equation as a c - number phase space evolution equation using the wigner representation @xmath33 where @xmath34 , the characteristic function for the wigner representation , is given by @xmath35 this transcription is particularly useful for semi - classical treatments .",
    "the equation for the wigner function for the nondegenerate parametric amplifier that corresponds to the master equation ( [ a2 ] ) turns out to be @xmath36    if we drop the third order derivative terms , in an approximation valid in the limit of large photon number , we can equate the resulting truncated fokker - planck equation describing the evolution of the wigner function with a set of it stochastic equations which read as follows    @xmath37    the non - vanishing noise correlations are given by @xmath38    if we compare the two sets of it stochastic equations , namely ( [ a6 ] ) and ( [ a11 ] ) , we notice that the main difference between the two is in the structure of the noise terms . while the noise terms in the positive - p equations ( [ a6 ] ) depend on the pumping amplitude and the nonlinear coupling constant , those in the wigner representation do not .",
    "in fact they correspond precisely to the noise terms that one adds , in the linear case , in compliance with the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .    in some sense , one can interpret the noise terms in the wigner case as accounting for vacuum fluctuations .",
    "however , the truncated wigner theory must be treated cautiously , since it neglects important third - order correlations which are not always negligible .",
    "these equations imply that @xmath39 when there is no driving and no coupling , as expected for a vacuum state in a symmetrically - ordered representation .",
    "however , a vacuum state is _ not _ obtained semi - classically if there is any coupling @xmath10 , even with a vacuum input , which is an unphysical feature .",
    "the full wigner theory has no such limitations : but it is no longer positive - definite , and therefore has no equivalent stochastic formulation .",
    "in comparing these methods , we notice that the classical equations of course give no information at all about the quantum fluctuations , although they give an excellent guide to the location of the critical point when the threshold photon number is large .    to include quantum effects",
    ", one might imagine that a direct numerical calculation in a photon number basis would be useful , provided the maximum photon number was small .",
    "we note that in a three - mode system , the hilbert space dimension scales as @xmath40 , while the density matrix has @xmath41components provided the boson number is bounded by @xmath42 in practice , one finds that typical experiments have @xmath43 .",
    "this implies that neither the full density matrix nor even the reduced wave - function in a stochastic wave - function calculation@xcite can in general be calculated directly with current computers , for practical reasons of memory and computational time .",
    "direct number state methods are also not convenient for analytical approximations .",
    "other techniques involve feynman ( or related ) diagrams , using a hierarchy of correlation functions@xcite .",
    "these methods give useful results below threshold , and have similarities to perturbation theory using stochastic methods , which we discuss later .",
    "the drawbacks are that these diagrammatic methods appear less systematic than phase - space methods , since certain classes of diagrams are discarded , and the results usually diverge at the critical point .",
    "semi - classical methods overcome some of these limitations .",
    "the wigner truncation approximation does include quantum fluctuation effects , but is only valid if all photon numbers are large , which is a highly questionable assumption in the signal / idler modes below threshold .",
    "in addition , the neglected third - order derivative terms are at best only suppressed by a polynomial factor , and there are no other methods to check the accuracy of the approximation .    by comparison , the approximation of neglecting boundary terms in the positive - p equations appears well - justified in these calculations as long as @xmath32 . if necessary",
    "- that is , if unstable trajectories occur - the technique can be checked with the more precise stochastic gauge approach .",
    "no evidence was found that boundary terms were significant here , even for the relatively low damping rates used in the numerics .",
    "as one might expect , the truncated wigner method gives rise to unphysical predictions at low driving field , which does not occur with the positive - p equations - given the parameters used here .",
    "accordingly , we mainly focus on the positive - p phase - space method in this paper .",
    "in order to understand what types of calculation to carry out for this system , it is important to identify observable measurements that can be carried out , and relate these to operators and their correlations .",
    "the positive - p stochastic method directly reproduces the normally ordered correlations and moments , while the wigner representation reproduces the symmetrically ordered moments .",
    "of course , commutation relations can always be used to transform one type of ordering into the other .",
    "further , we also have to distinguish between the internal and external operator moments , since measurements are normally performed on output fields that are external to the cavity . the necessary formalism for treating external field spectra was introduced and developed by yurke@xcite , and by collett and gardiner@xcite .",
    "as we shall see , there is a direct relationship between the output field spectra of a nondegenerate opo , and observable criteria for epr correlations and entanglement .",
    "the squeezing in terms of the intra - cavity quadrature covariances corresponds to an instantaneous measurement of the field moments@xmath44 where we define@xmath45 to denote internal quadrature operators .",
    "similarly , complex quadratures@xcite are defined as :    @xmath46    with a normally - ordered intra - cavity variance of:@xmath47    if such measurements were possible , they would include contributions from all frequencies",
    ". however , it is more typical that one has access to spectrally resolved quadrature measurements of the output fields , and these are generally more useful as measures of entanglement and squeezing .",
    "the external field measurements are obtained from the input - output relations : @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the input and output photon fields respectively , evaluated at the output - coupling mirror , and @xmath51 is the intra - cavity photon field .",
    "the most efficient transport of squeezing is obtained if we assume that all the signal losses occur through the output coupler , so that @xmath52 .",
    "we will assume this to be the case for simplicity , though the necessary corrections@xcite for imperfect interferometers simply involve the ratio @xmath53 .",
    "the measured output spectral covariance @xmath54 of a general quadrature @xmath55 can be written as@xmath56 where the fluctuations @xmath57 are defined as @xmath58 , @xmath59 is a phase angle related to a phase sensitive local oscillator measurement , and the frequency argument denotes a fourier transform : @xmath60    we also introduce complex quadratures and their fourier transforms , which are useful for computational purposes:@xmath61 the spectral quadrature operators @xmath62 are _ not _ formally hermitian , except at @xmath63 .      in practice ,",
    "one is mostly interested in external spectral measurements taken over a long but finite interval , after a steady - state is achieved . for output measurements",
    "averaged over a long time @xmath64 , it is the low frequency part of the spectrum that is the relevant quantity , as it usually determines the maximum squeezing or entanglement possible . for simplicity",
    ", we will focus on the @xmath63 case , where we can define _ observable _ frequency - domain quadrature operators as:@xmath65    since @xmath66 when mapping a fourier transform to a fourier series , the complex quadrature spectrum for a finite time interval is normalized as:@xmath67 in particular , the most important spectra are the unsqueezed and squeezed spectra defined by:@xmath68^{2}+\\left[\\widehat{y}_{1}^{o}-\\widehat{y}_{2}^{o}\\right]^{2}\\right\\rangle \\nonumber \\\\ v^{\\pi/2}(0 ) & = & \\frac{1}{4}\\left\\langle \\left[\\widehat{y}_{1}^{o}+\\widehat{y}_{2}^{o}\\right]^{2}+\\left[\\widehat{x}_{1}^{o}-\\widehat{x}_{2}^{o}\\right]^{2}\\right\\rangle \\,\\,.\\label{eq : vzero}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in other words , the complex quadrature spectra simply correspond to simultaneous sum and difference measurements on the two observed output quadratures for the signal and idler , with the precise quadratures observed adjustable via the local oscillator phase angle @xmath59 .",
    "the properties of external quadratures for @xmath69 are experimentally important since technical noise normally prohibits direct quadrature measurements at @xmath63",
    ". nevertheless , even at @xmath69 the quadratures are decomposable@xcite into pairs of mutually commuting hermitian operators with similar properties to the intra - cavity quadrature operators , by using discrete sine and cosine transforms .",
    "these results therefore hold at non - zero frequencies .",
    "the correlations are closely related to those proposed by epr",
    ". we will give more details in the next section , explaining the relationship of this type of measurement with the epr paradox and entanglement .",
    "we now wish to relate these observed operator correlations with the stochastic correlations that are used to calculate them via the c - number equivalences .      in the p - representation",
    "normally - ordered operator averages directly relate to stochastic moments with respect to the positive p - function : @xmath70 where the internal stochastic variables corresponding to the quadratures are denoted:@xmath71    also , the positive p-",
    "spectral correlations correspond to the normally ordered , time - ordered operator correlations of the measured fields .",
    "this leads to the following well - known result for the general squeezing spectrum , as measured in an external homodyne detection scheme : @xmath72 this calculation only involves the internal stochastic quadrature spectral variables , defined as:@xmath73 note that vacuum ( input ) field terms do not contribute directly to this spectrum , as they have a vanishing normally - ordered spectrum , and are not correlated with the coherent amplitudes in the positive p- representation .      in the wigner representation ,",
    "on the other hand , the moments and correlations with respect to the wigner function are directly related to averages of symmetrically ordered operators .",
    "it becomes necessary to rewrite the normally - ordered internal field averages in terms of symmetrically ordered averages using equal - time commutators . as a result",
    "the two spectral orderings are related by:@xmath74    similarly , for the normally - ordered squeezing spectrum , as measured in an external homodyne detection scheme , one has : @xmath75 here we define fourier transforms of fluctuations as previously , except with respect to stochastic output fields:@xmath76",
    "where:@xmath77    it is essential to include the vacuum field contributions from reflected input fields , as these are correlated with the internal wigner amplitudes , and hence contribute significantly to the spectrum .",
    "in fact , these input fields can be shown to correspond directly to the noise terms in the wigner representation stochastic equations , leading to the identification : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is a c - number amplitude corresponding ( in the wigner representation ) to the quantum vacuum input field , and @xmath80  .",
    "the fundamental property of the wigner function is that the ensemble average of any polynomial of the random variable @xmath81 and @xmath82 weighted by the wigner density exactly corresponds to the hilbert - space expectation of the corresponding symmetrized product of the annihilation and creation operators .",
    "therefore , the truncated theory with a positive wigner function can be viewed as equivalent to a hidden variable theory , since one can obtain quadrature fluctuation predictions by following an essentially classical prescription ; in which even the noise terms have a classical interpretation as corresponding a form of zero - point fluctuations .",
    "this description can not be equivalent to quantum mechanics in general , but may provide results which , under some circumstances , turn out to be quite similar to the quantum mechanical results .",
    "a quantitative , experimentally testable criterion for the epr paradox was proposed in 1989  @xcite .",
    "it is important to understand the physical interpretation of this paradox .",
    "epr originally assumed local realism , and claimed that an observation of perfectly correlated positions and momenta would imply the incompleteness of quantum mechanics .",
    "a modern interpretation is that one can merely deduce the _ inconsistency _ of local realism with quantum mechanical completeness , since local realism in einstein s original sense is no longer widely accepted .",
    "this is a weaker paradox than the bell inequality - which rules out all local realistic interpretations .",
    "however , the bell inequality has not yet been violated , due to causality and/or measurement inefficiency issues ( though weaker inequalities have been violated ) .",
    "the epr paradox with quadrature variables has the advantage that the required degree of measurement efficiency is readily achievable with photo - detectors , since it does not require single - photon counting .",
    "consider two spatially separated subsystems at @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "observables @xmath85 (  \" position  \" ) and @xmath86 (  \" momentum  \" ) are defined for subsystem @xmath83 , where the two operators have a commutator of @xmath87=2 $ ] , so that by heisenberg s uncertainty principle , @xmath88 .",
    "suppose that the two subsystems are partially correlated , as may occur in a real experiment , as opposed to the ideal correlations in the epr _",
    "one may still predict the result of measurement @xmath85 , based on the result of a causally separated measurement @xmath89 performed at @xmath84 .",
    "however , the prediction is imperfect , and has an associated inference error .",
    "also , for a different choice of measurement @xmath90 at @xmath84 , suppose that one may predict the result of measurement @xmath86 at @xmath83 .",
    "we define @xmath91 here @xmath92 labels all outcomes of the measurement @xmath89 at @xmath84 , and @xmath93 is the standard deviation of the conditional distribution @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the conditional result of the measurement @xmath85 at @xmath83 , given the measurement @xmath89 at @xmath84 .",
    "the probability @xmath96 is the probability for a result @xmath92 upon measurement of @xmath89 .",
    "next , we define an inference variance @xmath97 as the average variance of the conditional ( inference ) variances @xmath93 for the prediction ( inference ) of the result @xmath95 for @xmath85 at @xmath83 , conditional on a measurement @xmath89 at @xmath84 .",
    "we define @xmath98 similarly to represent the weighted variance associated with the prediction ( inference ) of the result @xmath86 at @xmath83 , based on the result of the measurement at @xmath84 .    the 1989 inferred h.u.p .",
    "criterion  @xcite to demonstrate epr correlations in the spirit of the epr paradox is @xmath99    this epr - style criterion ( [ eqn : eprcrit ] ) was not given in the epr paper , but has the useful property that it represents a quantitative inequality that can be experimentally satisfied , without having to construct an experimentally impossible state with perfect correlations , as in the original proposal . as an added advantage ,",
    "the application of this inequality to electromagnetic quadrature variables allows the use of efficient photo - detection techniques , which makes this a completely practical measure .",
    "by contrast , the violation of a bell inequality - while having stronger consequences - is more difficult to achieve , owing to poor efficiencies encountered in single - particle detectors and polarizers . for either type of experiment ,",
    "a crucial element is the causal separation of detectors . without this , arguments using causality provide no constraints or inequalities at all .",
    "it is not always convenient to measure each conditional distribution @xmath94 and @xmath100 and its associated mean and variance .",
    "a simpler procedure@xcite is to propose that upon a result @xmath92 for the measurement at @xmath84 the predicted value for the result @xmath95 at @xmath83 is given linearly by the estimate @xmath101 .",
    "the rms error in this estimate after optimizing for @xmath102 is @xmath103 where @xmath104 .",
    "the best choice for @xmath105 minimizes @xmath106 and can be adjusted by experiment , or calculated as discussed in  @xcite to be @xmath107 , where we define @xmath108 .",
    "generally the linear estimate will correspond not be the best estimate for the outcome at @xmath83 , based on the result at @xmath84 .",
    "therefore generally we have @xmath109 and @xmath110@xcite .",
    "the observation of @xmath111 will then also imply epr correlations in the spirit of the epr paradox .",
    "entanglement may be deduced through a whole set of criteria , of which the epr criterion ( [ eqn : eprcrit ] ) is one@xcite .",
    "it is possible to deduce entanglement through other criteria@xcite without the need to prove the strong epr correlations .",
    "this has significance within quantum mechanics , but not necessarily the broader implications of the epr criterion .",
    "such entanglement criteria , derived by duan et.al . and",
    "simon@xcite , are based on the proof of quantum inseparability , where the failure of a separable density matrix @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) is proved .",
    "particularly useful for our purposes is a criterion considered by duan et al , sufficient to demonstrate entanglement ( inseparability ) .",
    "we define @xmath114 entanglement is guaranteed provided that the sum of the variances is bounded by : @xmath115    this observation of this entanglement criterion ( [ eqn : insepcrit ] ) may be identified as a `` two - mode squeezing '' criterion for entanglement , since the individual criterion @xmath116 is the criterion for the observation of a type of `` two - mode squeezing '' . in this way",
    "we see that fields that are two - mode squeezed with respect to both @xmath117 and @xmath118 , each satisfying ( [ eq : onemodesqz ] ) , are necessarily entangled .",
    "the epr correlations are predicted possible for the outputs of the parametric oscillator . for intracavity entanglement , we define the quadrature phase amplitudes @xmath119 and identify correlated observables for the oscillator , so that @xmath95 is correlated with @xmath92 and @xmath120 is correlated with @xmath121 . the heisenberg uncertainty relation for the orthogonal amplitudes of mode",
    "@xmath4 is @xmath122 .",
    "as explained in the previous section , for practical reasons it is preferable to use the corresponding observable external quadratures defined at or near zero frequency , which are @xmath123 .",
    "however , the detailed arguments only depend on having the commutators defined above , together with the requirement of causality - that is , the observations must take place with space - like separations between the two detectors over the whole observation period @xmath64 .",
    "we calculate several types of epr or entanglement measures .",
    "firstly we evaluate the the 1989 inferred h. u. p. epr criterion ( [ eqn : eprcrit ] ) but using the linear estimate form , which will allow demonstration of both entanglement and epr correlations defined in the spirit of the original epr paradox . in terms of quadrature phase amplitude measurements this strong epr criterion is satisfied when @xmath124 now @xmath125 and @xmath126 will minimize@xcite the inference variances . substituting for @xmath127 and @xmath128 , we explicitly calculate @xmath129 and @xmath130 for our particular system moments such as have @xmath131 are zero and we have symmetry between @xmath132and @xmath133 modes , so that @xmath134 and@xmath135 the linear inference epr criterion ( [ eq : eprlin ] ) is then equivalent to:@xmath136    this criterion is not equivalent to ( [ eqn : eprcrit ] ) which is based on the conditionals , since the linear estimate may not be the best , in which case it is possible that ( [ eqn : eprcrit ] ) is satisfied while ( [ eqn : strong ] ) is not , and we do not pick up epr and entanglement where it exists . nevertheless the criterion ( [ eq : infvariance ] ) is sufficient to prove epr correlations and entanglement .    secondly , we calculate the duan and simon et .",
    "two - mode squeezing criteria ( [ eqn : insepcrit ] ) for entanglement . written in terms of quadrature phase amplitude measurements",
    "this becomes @xmath137 this criterion was explicitly shown to be both sufficient and necessary for entanglement for the case of gaussian states ( for appropriately chosen quadratures ) , meaning that in this case it would pick up any entanglement present .",
    "our system is not gaussian , and while these criteria are still sufficient to imply entanglement , they may not be necessary .",
    "it is always the case that for ideal squeezing , both the linear epr and the squeezed entanglement criteria are satisfied .",
    "where one has additional loss , however , it is possible for the squeezed - entanglement criterion ( [ eq : twomodequad ] ) to be satisfied but not the epr criterion ( [ eqn : strong ] ) .",
    "such situations have been studied by bowen et al@xcite .",
    "our situation could be different again , due to the fact that the underlying quantum states undergo nonlinear fluctuations and are inherently non - gaussian .",
    "in this section we use perturbation methods to study the nondegenerate parametric oscillator beyond the linearized regime both in the fully quantum mechanical approach using positive - p representation , and in the semi - classical approach based on the wigner function . in the positive p case",

    "surprisingly , these nonclassical and non - gaussian signatures only occur well below threshold , where one might have expected the usual linearized analysis to be applicable .",
    "this suggests that experimental tests of the present theory may be carried out either near threshold - where the largest effects will be observed in the enhanced critical fluctuations of the unsqueezed quadrature - or well below threshold , where nonclassical triple correlations are predicted .",

    "<S> we present a fully quantum mechanical treatment of the nondegenerate optical parametric oscillator both below and near threshold . </S>",
    "<S> this is a non - equilibrium quantum system with a critical point phase - transition , that is also known to exhibit strong yet easily observed squeezing and quantum entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> our treatment makes use of the positive p - representation and goes beyond the usual linearized theory . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our analytical results with numerical simulations and find excellent agreement . </S>",
    "<S> we also carry out a detailed comparison of our results with those obtained from stochastic electrodynamics , a theory obtained by truncating the equation of motion for the wigner function , with a view to locating regions of agreement and disagreement between the two . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate commonly used measures of quantum behavior including entanglement , squeezing and epr correlations as well as higher order tripartite correlations , and show how these are modified as the critical point is approached . in general , the critical fluctuations represent an ultimate limit to the possible entanglement that can be achieved in a nondegenerate parametric oscillator . </S>"
