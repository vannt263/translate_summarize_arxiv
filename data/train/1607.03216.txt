    "the standard jaynes - cummings model ( jcm ) is usually referred to as the simplest fully quantized light - matter interaction scheme involving just one atom and one mode of the radiation field . since its introduction in 1963 @xcite , the model has attracted a great deal of theoretical and experimental interest in the fields of laser physics and quantum optics @xcite , and this trend is due in part to its apparent simplicity and , more importantly , to its striking predictions about the dynamical properties of the subsystems involved with which the quantum optics community is now familiar , as for example the well - known phenomenon of _ collpases _ and _ revivals _ for the atomic excitation understood in terms of the grainy statistics of the radiation field @xcite .",
    "+ the jcm has become the source of inspiration for a wide variety of generalizations dealing with more general and/or realistic circumstances .",
    "the majority of them focused primarily upon multi - photon transitions and/or multimode fields @xcite ; engineering nonlinear atom - field couplings , like the buck - sukumar and kochetov models @xcite ( including some very recent improvements and extensions of the former with or without applying the rotating wave approximation @xcite ) , one - atom jc models involving two - photon interaction with intensity - dependence both in the atom - field coupling and the detuning @xcite , or adding nonlinear kerr - like media @xcite ; interacting or noninteracting two two - level atoms @xcite ; or even more complex systems involving a large group of @xmath0 two - level ( or multi - level ) atoms in the same cavity , such as the so - called tavis - cummings model ( tcm ) @xcite , to mention some examples . and still more recently , renewed attention has been paid to quantum decoherence and entanglement properties of light - matter interaction models  la jaynes - cummings whose central system is composed of two or three two - level atoms ( also called within the jargon of the quantum information framework as two- or three - qubit systems ) resonantly coupled with a cavity field prepared in a single number state and also with each other through dipole - dipole and ising - like interactions @xcite ( incidentally , spin - spin interactions such as these or similar have also been the theme of current interest in a manifold of areas such as optical lattices @xcite ; systems with trapped ions @xcite and microcavities @xcite ; and , even in the context of nearly localized and dipolarly coupled two identical molecules @xcite , where , under certain conditions , from an algebraic - structure point of view , intramolecular coupling models  la jaynes - cummings emerge ) ; moreover , along this line an interesting application based on the resonant two - atom jcm has been proposed with the aim of implementing novel protocols for unambiguous bell state discrimination for two qubits @xcite .",
    "+ this work is in keeping with the aforementioned spirit of putting forward another extension of the jaynes - cummings model , that is , a nonlinear version of it for the description of a qubit system composed of two identical two - level atoms that interact with each other via dipole - dipole and ising - like interaction and with a one - mode cavity field being in a coherent superposition of number states .",
    "the nonlinear character of the model is construed in a twofold sense : i ) the interaction between the atomic system and the field is considered to be nonlinear in a way such that it hinges on the number of photons of the latter , and ii ) the said atomic system can be allowed to be embedded in a kind of nonlinear medium inside the cavity . in considering a buck - sukumar nonlinear coupling @xcite between the atoms and the field and a kerr - like medium within the cavity as particular cases , a full algebraic solution of the problem is provided and the consequences of incorporating such nonlinearities are illustrated by exploring , in the resonant quantum dynamics , some quantities of current physical interest , such as population inversion , purity , and concurrence , as far as the atomic system is concerned , and the time behavior of the field itself is also investigated in terms of its entropy and its image on phase space . it is worth commenting that the set of results reported here , regarding the aforesaid nonlinear coupling scheme , may also be of some relevance in the light of novel experimental and theoretical research on optical simulation of the jaynes - cummings and rabi models in arrays of coupled photonic waveguides @xcite , as well as in current designs of architectures intended for quantum computation and communication based on cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) studies for solid - state superconducting electrical circuits @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we should stress the fact that the present treatment is not only valid for interactions between quantized fields and atoms , but also in the context of trapped ions interacting with lasers ( classical ) fields where a number of phenomena known from nonlinear optics , including kerr - like nonlinearities , can be easily produced ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "so , from our point of view , the foregoing contributions may open up the possibility of realizing hamiltonian models such as the one we are considering in physically different but algebraically equivalent contexts .",
    "+ the content of the paper is the following . in section 2 the hamiltonian model and its general solution for two ising- and dipole - dipole interacting and identical two - level atoms",
    "are introduced .",
    "section 3 , which in turn is divided into three subsections , is thoroughly devoted to the discussion of some properties of the atomic system in terms of its population , purity and concurrence dynamics ; all these features are explored by taking into consideration each nonlinear contribution of the model . in section 4 ,",
    "the effect of such nonlinearities on the evolution of the cavity field is explored based upon its entropy and its phase space picture via the q - function . and",
    "finally , in section 5 some conclusions are given .",
    "let the hamiltonian model of the system under study be encoded as follows : @xmath1 where the constituent hamiltonians are explicitly given , in the schrdinger picture , and under the rotating - wave approximation , by @xmath2 here , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the energy operators for the field and atoms , respectively , the coupling between the atomic system and the radiation field is described by @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the contribution to the total system of the atom - atom interaction mentioned above .",
    "the field mode frequency is @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the atomic transition frequency , @xmath9 is the coupling constant ( which is taken to be the same for both atoms ) , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are , respectively , the ising and dipole - dipole parameters . as usual ,",

    "finally , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , with @xmath21 , are photon - number - dependent functions that represent the aforesaid nonlinear character of the whole system .    at this point , we note in passing that although we shall be working with parameters such that the rotating - wave approximation is considered to be valid , we also have to be careful with the field intensities reflected upon the functions @xmath20 and @xmath19 , always taking into account that the conditions @xmath22 and @xmath23 are fulfilled and that the effective detuning @xmath24 still allows us to work within the two - level atom approximation . the origin of and the role played by such an intensity - dependent detuning can readily be seen if we reframed our system under the transformation @xmath25 to get an atom - field coupling structure of the form @xmath26 , with the fitting identification @xmath27 of the detuning we are referring to .",
    "the intensity - dependent part of the latter is construed as the frequency separation between adjacent energy levels of a nonlinear field ( i.e. , a nonlinear oscillator , viewed as a whole ) whose spectrum is clearly nonequidistant by virtue of @xmath19 in the definition of the field hamiltonian @xmath3 . + here",
    ", we find it convenient to choose the framework generated by the unitary operator @xmath28 $ ] so that one can recast hamiltonian ( [ eq : totalham ] ) , on inserting it into the transformation @xmath29 as follows @xmath30 where we have labeled @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "it is well - known that the dynamics of a system such as this involving a single - photon process where the number of excitations is a conserved quantity ( as can be verified since the excitation number operator @xmath33 commutes with hamiltonian ( [ eq : totalhamtrans ] ) ) the set of states defined by @xmath34 may be employed as a basis to diagonalize the hamiltonian under study ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "however , one can see that it is also possible to employ the following fitting basis : @xmath35 and @xmath36 turns out to be convenient in the sense that it will allows us to simplify subsequent calculations ( such a symmetric state , needless to say , is useful only in the particular case when the two atoms are identical ) .",
    "so , in this basis the representation of @xmath37 is a @xmath38 matrix with elements @xmath39 for a given number of photons @xmath40 . in units",
    "where @xmath41 we get :    @xmath42    where , for the sake of simplicity , we have utilized the shorthand notation @xmath43 , @xmath44 , with @xmath45 .",
    "+ for all the above initial considerations , we now proceed to solve the eigenvalue equation @xmath46 for @xmath47 . tackling",
    "this problem entails solving a cubic polynomial equation whose roots are well - known .",

    "so , we let the corresponding set of normalized eigenvectors be written as @xmath57 for @xmath47 , and where the normalization factor @xmath58 reads @xmath59 in order to further simplify subsequent algebraic manipulations we let ( [ eq : vector ] ) be recast as @xmath60 with the following correspondences @xmath61 from which one can also deduce that @xmath62 this set of results will be our starting point for examining some properties of physical interest concerning the evolution of either the atomic system or the cavity field , such as the population inversion , entanglement dynamics based on the purity and concurrence features , and the evolution of the field on phase space with the help of the q - function representation .",
    "let us first examine the effect of dipole - dipole and ising - like interactions on the dynamics of the atomic level occupation .",
    "the time evolution of this physical feature can be assessed by considering the inversion operator @xcite @xmath63 together with the use of the wave function @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the initial state of the whole system . for the time being , let the initial state be in a way such that the atoms are both in their corresponding excited state and the cavity field in a coherent superposition of number states , i.e. , @xmath66 which , by utilizing ( [ eq : basis2 ] ) , can be rewritten as @xmath67 so that @xmath68 where we have set the time - dependent coefficient @xmath69 by taking the expectation value of ( [ eq : opdz ] ) with the help of ( [ eq : wavefunc ] ) , and after making some rearrangements , we arrive at the desired result for the atomic inversion @xmath70 in which @xmath71 represents the initial photon distribution function of the field , @xmath72 with @xmath73 and @xmath74 being given by ( [ eq : q ] ) and ( [ eq : theta ] ) , respectively . and , following a similar notation as in ref .",

    "[ this is , incidentally , an approximate and justified model widely used in nonlinear optics @xcite whenever the medium s time response is sufficiently small so that the medium itself may be regarded as being able to follow the field in an adiabatic manner @xcite ; an agreeable and thorough treatment of the subject had already been undertaken , for instance , by buzek and jex @xcite in their work on the jaynes - cummings model with only one atom when the cavity is supposed to be filled with a kerr - like medium ] .",
    "secondly , the influence of the interplay between the two atoms ( @xmath87 ) upon the population dynamics is explored by taking into consideration a standard cavity , i.e. , when @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) . unless otherwise specified , in subsequent calculations the initial state of the field is considered to be a coherent state with a poissonian statistiscal distribution @xmath90 with @xmath91 photons .",

    "it is worth highlighting that this set of equations can also be viewed as dependent on the difference @xmath97 for a given @xmath86 , instead of focusing separately on the values of @xmath11 and @xmath10 .",
    "such a dependency is of course reflected upon the rabi frequencies ( [ eq : rabi1])-([eq : rabi3 ] ) and the set of weighting amplitudes ( [ eq : amplitudes ] ) by direct substitution of @xmath73 and @xmath74 given above .",
    "it is clear then that the dipole - dipole and ising interactions cancel each other when the equality @xmath98 holds , as though there was a kind of trade - off between both atomic interactions . + the evolution of atomic excitation exhibits its characteristic collpase - and - revival behavior ( explained in terms of the granular statistics of the field @xcite ) but in a not - so - conventional fashion , depending on whether the nonlinear character of the medium is featured or whether the interplay of the atoms , together with the nonlinear coupling between them and the radiation field , is taken into account in our description .",

    "both the purity and concurrence atomic properties are bolstered by the buck - sukumar coupling itself at certain time instants , and by the kerr - like medium up to some degree , particularly when the atomic system is in its maximally entangled state . as to the atomic purity and field entropy , it was also found that the dipole - dipole and ising effects , though not - so - significant by themselves , become manifest in the regime when the ratio of the whole atomic parameter to the constant coupling is such that @xmath239 , but nevertheless we suggest that one should be careful of working on this regime given that , as far as we know , it has not been proven in the literature to be suitably justified at such high values ; this is why we have chosen here to be moderate in the use of small values of the aforesaid parameter .",
    "finally , we have explored the dynamics of the field in terms of its entropy and evolution on phase space via the q - function , where the role played by buck - sukumar nonlinear coupling and the kerr medium were found to be preponderant in the splitting of phase properties of the field giving rise to schrdinger - cat - like states .",
