    "over three decades ago , stephan hawking @xcite found that , utilizing the procedure of quantum field theory in curved spacetime , the radiation spectrum is almost like that of a black body , and can be described by a characteristic hawking temperature with a purely thermal spectrum which yields to non - unitarity of quantum theory where maps a pure state to a mixed state .",
    "it has been proposed that hawking radiation can be extracted from the null geodesic method suggested by parikh and wilczek @xcite . in their method , they take the back - reaction effects into consideration and present a leading correction to the probability of massless particles tunneling across the horizon .",
    "the tunneling process clarifies that the extended radiation spectrum is not precisely thermal which leads to unitarity .",
    "recently , nicolini , smailagic and spallucci ( nss ) @xcite derived that black hole in a new model of noncommutativity does not allow to decay lower than a _ minimal mass _ @xmath0 , i.e. black hole remnant ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "if we really believe the idea of stable black hole remnants due to the fact that there are some exact continuous global symmetries in nature @xcite , and also do not find any correlations between the tunneling rates of different modes in the black hole radiation spectrum , then these leave only one possibility : the information stays inside the black hole and can be retained by a stable planck - sized remnant @xcite . although , this issue is then accepted if information conservation is really conserved in our universe .",
    "thus we proceed our work with hope that this model of noncommutativity can provide a way to explain how the charged black hole decays , particularly in its final stages .",
    "the nss model of noncommutativity of coordinates that is carried on by the gaussian distribution of coherent states , is consistent with lorentz invariance , unitarity and uv - finiteness of quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "since the noncommutativity of spacetime is an innate property of the manifold by itself even in absence of gravity , then some kind of divergences which emerge in general relativity and black hole physics , can be removed by it .",
    "then with hope to cure the divergences of evaporation process of black hole physics we apply both back - reaction and noncommutativity effects to proceed the radiative process .",
    "the plan of this paper is the following . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we perform a brief discussion about the existence of black hole remnant within the noncommutative coordinate fluctuations at short distances ( noncommutative inspired reissner - nordstrm solutions ) .",
    "we pay special attention to study of hawking temperature . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , a detailed calculation of quantum tunneling near the smeared quantum horizon by considering a new model of noncommutativity is provided .",
    "the tunneling amplitude at which charged massive particles tunnel across the event horizon is computed and its applicability for the reissner - nordstrm black hole is discussed . and finally the paper is ended with summary ( sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] ) .",
    "there exist many formulations of noncommutative field theory based on the weyl - wigner - moyal @xmath1-product @xcite that lead to failure in resolving of some important problems , such as lorentz invariance breaking , loss of unitarity and uv divergences of quantum field theory . but",
    "recently , smailagic and spallucci @xcite explained a fascinating model of noncommutativity , the coordinate coherent states approach , that can be free from the problems mentioned above . in this approach , a point - like mass @xmath2 , and a point - charge @xmath3 instead of being quite localized at a point , are described by a smeared structure throughout a region of linear size @xmath4 .",
    "the approach we adopt here is to look for a static , asymptotically flat , spherically symmetric , minimal width , gaussian distribution of mass and charge whose noncommutative size is determined by the parameter @xmath4 . to do this end , we shall model the mass and charge distributions by a smeared delta function @xmath5 ( see @xcite ) @xmath6 the line element which solves einstein s equations in the presence of smeared mass and charge sources can be obtained as @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the smeared mass and charge distributions respectively and can implicity be given in terms of the lower incomplete gamma function , @xmath10 throughout the paper , natural units are used with the following definitions ; @xmath11 . in the limit @xmath12 , the noncommutative ( modified ) reissner - nordstrm solution reduced to the commutative ( ordinary ) case and @xmath13 , @xmath14 as expected .",
    "the outer and inner horizons of this line element can be found where @xmath15 , which are respectively given by @xmath16 the noncommutative horizon radius versus the mass and charge can approximately be calculated by setting @xmath17 into the lower incomplete gamma function as @xmath18 with @xmath19 \\\\",
    "q_{\\theta\\pm}\\equiv q_{\\theta\\pm}(m , q)=q\\sqrt{{\\cal{e}}^2\\left(\\frac{m\\pm\\sqrt{m^2-q^2}}{2\\sqrt{\\theta}}\\right )   -\\frac{m\\pm\\sqrt{m^2-q^2}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\theta}}{\\cal{e}}\\left(\\frac{m\\pm\\sqrt{m^2-q^2}}{\\sqrt{2\\theta}}\\right)},\\\\ \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath20 shows the _ gauss error function _ defined as @xmath21 for very large masses , the @xmath22 tends to unity and the exponential term will be reduced to zero and one retrieves the classical reissner - nordstrm horizons , @xmath23 .",
    "the radiating behavior of such modified reissner - nordstrm black hole can now be found to calculate its temperature as follows @xmath24\\]]@xmath25.\\ ] ] for the commutative case , @xmath26 , one recovers the classical hawking temperature , @xmath27 .",
    "the numerical calculation of such noncommutative hawking temperature as a function of @xmath28 , for some values of @xmath3 is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .    in this modified version ,",
    "not only the hawking temperature does not diverge at all but also it reaches a maximum value before dropping to absolute zero at a minimal non - zero mass , @xmath29 , that black hole shrinks to . in other words , fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] shows that coordinate noncommutativity yields to the existence of a minimal non - zero mass which black hole can reduce to .",
    "therefore , in the noncommutative framework , black hole does nt evaporate completely and this leads to a planck - sized remnant including _ the information_. so information might be preserved in this remnant .",
    "however , it is not conceivable to date to give a clear answer to the question of the black hole information paradox and this is reasonable because there is no complete self - consistent quantum theory of evaporating black holes ( for reviews on resolving the so - called _ information loss paradox _ , see @xcite ) .    in this situation , we should note that our calculation to obtain the eq .",
    "( [ mat:5 ] ) is accurate and no approximation has been made . if we want to acquire the simple @xmath30-dependent form of the noncommutative hawking temperature , then it can be approximated as follows @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the noncommutative surface gravity at the horizon and is given by @xmath33 in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , we will use this approximate expression to compute the tunneling probability when the first law of black hole thermodynamics is applied ( see eq .",
    "( [ mat:23 ] ) ) .",
    "we are now ready to discuss the quantum tunneling process in the noncommutative framework . to describe this procedure , where a particle moves in dynamical geometry and pass through the horizon without singularity on the path we should use the coordinates systems that , unlike reissner - nordstrm coordinates , are not singular at the horizon ( the outer horizon ) .",
    "a particularly convenient choice is painlev coordinate @xcite which is obtained by definition of a new noncommutative time coordinate , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the reissner time coordinate , and @xmath36 note that only the reissner time coordinate is transformed . both the radial coordinate and angular coordinates remain the same .",
    "the noncommutative painlev metric now immediately reads @xmath37 @xmath38 it should be stressed here that the eq .",
    "( [ mat:7 ] ) , in accord with landau s theory of the synchronization of clocks @xcite , allows us to synchronize clocks in any infinitesimal radial positions of space ( @xmath39 ) . since the tunneling phenomena through the quantum horizon i.e. _ the barrier _ is an instantaneous procedure it is important to consider landau s theory of the coordinate clock synchronization in the tunneling process .",
    "the mechanism for tunneling through the quantum horizon is that particle anti - particle pair is created at the event horizon .",
    "so , we have two events that occur simultaneously ; one event is anti - particle and tunnels into the barrier but the other particle tunnels out the barrier . in fact , the eq .",
    "( [ mat:7 ] ) mentions the difference of coordinate times for these two simultaneous events occurring at infinitely adjacent radial positions .",
    "furthermore , the noncommutative painlev - reissner - nordstrm metric exhibits the stationary , non - static , and neither coordinate singularity nor intrinsic singularity .    to obtain the radial geodesics of the charged massive particles tunneling across the potential barrier which are different with the uncharged massless @xcite and also the uncharged massive @xcite ones",
    ", we follow the same noncommutative method in this work but now extended to the case of charged massive particles . according to the non - relativistic quantum theory , de broglie s hypothesis and the wkb approximation ,",
    "it can be easily proved that the treatment of the massive particle s tunneling as a massive shell is approximately derived by the phase velocity @xmath40 of the de broglie s - wave whose the relationship between phase velocity @xmath40 and group velocity @xmath41 is given by @xcite @xmath42 overdot abbreviates @xmath43 . in the case of @xmath39 , according to the relation ( [ mat:7 ] ) , the group velocity is @xmath44 thus , the outgoing motion of the massive particles take the form @xmath45 if we suppose that @xmath46 increases towards the future then the above equations will be modified by the particle s self - gravitation effect @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . to assure the conservation of energy and electric charge",
    ", we fix the total adm mass ( @xmath2 ) and electric charge ( @xmath3 ) of the spacetime and permit the hole mass and its charge to fluctuate . in other words , we should replace @xmath2 by @xmath47 and @xmath3 by @xmath48 both in the eqs .",
    "( [ mat:8 ] ) and ( [ mat:11 ] ) , because the response of the background geometry is taken into account by an emitted quantum of energy @xmath49 with electric charge @xmath50 .",
    "thus , when a charged particle tunnels out , the black holes s mass and also electric charge will change for the conservation of energy and charge .    in order to consider the effect of the electromagnetic field , it is necessary to take into account maxwell gravity system comprises of the black hole and the electromagnetic field outside the hole .",

    "we have computed the numerical results of both the noncommutative coulomb - like potential and commutative case which are shown in fig .  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "when a charged particle passes through the event horizon , the whole system will transit from one state to another . in order to remove the freedom equivalent to @xmath60 , due to the fact that it is an ignorable coordinate , the action",
    "is then found to be @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the canonical momentum conjugate to @xmath60 . since the characteristic wavelength of the radiation is always haphazardly small near the horizon due to the infinite blue - shift there , so that the wave - number reaches infinity and the wkb approximation is reliable close to the horizon . in the wkb approximation ,",

    "there is a problem here recognized as `` factor @xmath72 problem '' @xcite .",
    "lately , some authors ( see @xcite and references therein ) have stated that the expression ( [ mat:18 ] ) is not invariant under canonical transformations however the same formula with a factor of @xmath73 in the exponent is canonically invariant .",
    "this procedure yields a temperature higher than the hawking temperature by a factor of @xmath72 . in refs .",
    "@xcite , a resolution to this problem was given in terms of an overlooked temporal contribution to the tunneling amplitude .",
    "when one includes this temporal contribution one gets exact the correct temperature and exactly when one uses the canonically invariant tunneling amplitude . ]",
    "@xmath74 to calculate the imaginary part of the action we consider a spherical shell to consist of components of the charged massive particles each of which travels on a radial timelike geodesic , so that we will use these radial timelike geodesics like an s - wave outgoing positive energy particle which pass through the horizon outwards from @xmath75 to @xmath76 to compute the @xmath77 , as follows @xmath78dr,\\ ] ] we now alter the integral variables by using hamilton s equations @xmath79 hence , the imaginary part of the action gives the following expression : @xmath80dr.\\ ] ] substituting the expression of @xmath81 from ( [ mat:11 ] ) into ( [ mat:21 ] ) , under the condition that the self - gravitation effect of the particle itself is included , we have , @xmath82dr,\\ ] ] where @xmath83 the @xmath84 integral has a pole at the outer horizon where lies along the line of integration .",
    "this integral can be done first by deforming the contour and it yields to ( @xmath85 ) times the residue . note that we require @xmath86 where : @xmath87 thus , @xmath88 = \\pi\\left[\\int_{(0,0)}^{(e , q)}\\frac{de'}{\\kappa'}-\\frac{v'}{\\kappa'}dq'\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath89 in the above expressions , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively , are the electro - potential on the event horizon and the horizon surface gravity in which self - gravitations are comprised . here , utilizing the first low of black hole thermodynamics , @xmath92 , one can find the imaginary part of the action as @xcite @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the difference in noncommutative black hole entropies before and after emission . since , both particle and anti - particle ( which corresponds to a time reversed situation and it can be seen that as backward in time by replacing @xmath95 , by @xmath96 , in the metric ( [ mat:8 ] ) ) anticipate in the emission rate for the hawking process via tunneling with same amounts , therefore we should have to add their amplitudes first and then to square it to obtain the emission probability , @xmath97.\\ ] ] hawking radiation as tunneling was also investigated in the context of black holes in string theory @xcite , and it was exhibited that the emission rates in the high energy corresponds to a difference between counting of states in the microcanonical and canonical ensembles . thus at higher energies the emission spectrum can not be precisely thermal due to the fact that the high energy corrections arise from the physics of energy and charge conservation with noncommutativity corrections .",
    "in fact , the emission rate ( [ mat:25 ] ) deviates from the pure thermal emission but is consistent with an underlying unitary quantum theory and support the conservation of information @xcite .",
    "the question which arises here is the possible dependencies between different modes of radiation during the evaporation @xcite and then the time - evolution of these possible correlations which needs further investigation and probably shed more light on information loss problem .",

    ", we have extended the parikh - wilczek tunnelling process to calculate the tunneling probability of a charged massive particle from the reissner - nordstrm black hole within the framework of noncommutative quasi coordinates .",
