    "recently , rf energy harvesting technique has been integrated and implemented in cognitive radio networks ( crns ) .",
    "this leads to a new type of networks , called rf - powered crns . in these networks",
    ", secondary users can harvest rf energy when a primary channel is busy , and use the energy to transmit data when the primary channel is idle  @xcite .",
    "this is referred to as the harvest - then - transmit protocol / mode .",
    "there are many advantages of rf energy harvesting in crns as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "however , for rf - powered crns , when the channel idle probability is low , i.e. , the channel is mostly occupied by primary users , the secondary transmitters have less opportunity to transmit data , resulting in a low overall transmission rate for secondary networks .",
    "therefore , there is a need to overcome this shortcoming .",
    "ambient backscatter communication  @xcite has been introduced as a new communication method .",
    "the technique allows wireless data transmission between two wireless nodes using ambient signals without needing a standard form of energy supply and storage . in ambient backscatter communication ,",
    "when a transmitter wants to communicate with a receiver , the transmitter will backscatter signals received from a signal source , e.g. , a tv tower , to its receiver .",
    "the receiver then can decode and obtain useful information from the transmitter .",
    "however , similar to traditional rf - powered crns , the performance of backscatter communication greatly depends on the ambient signals .",
    "specifically , when the idle channel probability is high , the performance of the ambient backscatter communication is low due to limited time to backscatter .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we propose a novel model which utilizes the advantages of both backscatter communication and harvest - then - transmit protocol in rf - powered crns .",
    "in particular , we consider an rf - powered crn with the backscatter communication capability . in the network ,",
    "the secondary transmitter ( st ) is able not only to harvest energy from radio signals , but also to backscatter these signals to its receiver for data transmission . as highlighted in  @xcite",
    ", backscatter communication and energy harvesting can not practically be performed at the same time . if the st performs backscatter communication , the rf carrier wave is being modulated which can significantly reduce the amount of harvested energy , and mostly it is not sufficient to transmit data .",
    "clearly , when the channel is mostly busy , the st should use backscatter mode to transmit data .",
    "by contrast , when the channel is less busy , the st should use the harvest - then - transmit mode .",
    "this leads to an important question of how to tradeoff the time for using backscatter and harvest - then - transmit modes such that the overall transmission rate of the secondary user is maximized . here",
    ", the overall transmission rate refers to the total rate from both backscatter and harvest - then - transmit modes .",
    "the time tradeoff problem for wireless powered communication networks was studied in few work in the literature .",
    "for example , in  @xcite , the authors studied the tradeoff between the wireless energy transfer and wireless information transmission for wireless powered communication networks by introducing the harvest - then - transmit protocol with the aim to maximize the transmission rate for the network . in  @xcite , an optimal tradeoff time between the energy harvesting phase and the data transmission phase for an underlay crn was investigated through adopting the convex optimization technique . extending from  @xcite ,",
    "the authors in  @xcite considered a cooperation scenario for primary users ( pus ) and secondary users ( sus ) .",
    "the sus need to determine not only how much time for energy harvesting , but also how much power for pus data relay or data transmission to allocate .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the tradeoff between energy harvesting and backscatter communication for an overlay rf - powered crn .",
    "the main aim is to improve the overall transmission rate for the secondary network .",
    "we formulate an optimization problem to obtain the optimal time to perform energy harvesting and backscatter communication when the channel is busy .",
    "we show that the problem is convex , and hence any tool from convex optimization can be used to obtain a globally optimal solution . through numerical results ,",
    "we demonstrate that our proposed solution can significantly improve the performance for the secondary network compared with baseline methods . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first work that proposes the idea of integrating the ambient backscatter communication with wireless powered crns .",
    "moreover , we are the first that introduce the tradeoff analysis in rf - powered backscatter crns .",
    "we study an rf - powered backscatter crn composed of a primary transmitter ( pt ) , and a secondary transmitter ( st ) communicating with a secondary receiver ( sr ) .",
    "the st is equipped with an rf energy harvesting module and a backscatter circuit in order to harvest rf energy and backscatter radio signals , respectively .",
    "the st can also transmit data as normal wireless transmission . when the pt , e.g. , an amplitude modulated ( am ) broadcasting base station ( bs ) or a tv tower , transmits rf signal to its primary receiver ( pr ) , the primary channel is busy . at the same time , the st can either harvest energy and store it in the energy storage or backscatter the signal for data transmission  @xcite .",
    "the harvested energy is used for direct wireless data transmission to the sr when the primary channel is idle .",
    "this is referred to as the harvest - then - transmit mode while the other is referred to as the backscatter mode .",
    "we assume that the sr perfectly knows the mode of the st and applies corresponding demodulators to extract useful information .      in the proposed system , when the pt transmits signals , i.e.",
    ", the primary channel is busy , the st can transmit data to the sr using backscatter communication ( fig .",
    "[ system_model ] ( a ) ) or harvest energy ( fig .  [ system_model ] ( b ) ) .",
    "let @xmath0 denote the normalized channel idle period and @xmath1 denote the normalized channel busy period ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ system_model ] ) .",
    "when the channel is busy , @xmath2 denotes the time ratio for energy harvesting , and @xmath3 denotes the time ratio for backscatter communication .",
    "the energy harvested during the time ratio @xmath2 will be used for direct data transmission during the idle channel period .",
    "we observe that there is a tradeoff between the time ratio for backscatter communication and energy harvesting . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : motivate ]   is provided in section  [ sec : performance evaluation ] .",
    "] , when @xmath2 is small , i.e. , the st spends much time for backscatter communication , the overall transmission rate is small .",
    "this is from the fact that the st can not fully utilize the channel idle period for direct data transmission due to small amount of energy harvested . as @xmath2 increases ,",
    "the overall transmission rate increases since more harvested energy can be used to transmit more data . however ,",
    "when the st spends much time for energy harvesting , i.e. , @xmath2 is high , the overall transmission rate decreases since the channel idle period is limited while the backscatter communication is not efficiently used during the channel busy period .",
    "clearly , the st can achieve the optimal overall transmission rate by balancing between the backscatter communication and energy harvesting during the busy channel period .",
    "in particular , there is an optimal value for @xmath4 which we aim to achieve by formulating and solving an optimization problem presented in the following sections .",
    "we aim at maximizing the overall transmission rate of the secondary network which is the number of information bits transmitted by the st per time unit . we denote @xmath5 as the overall transmission rate which is obtained as follows : @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the numbers of transmitted bits using the backscatter mode and the harvest - then - transmit mode in a time unit , respectively .      in the following ,",
    "we explain how sr can receive information through using ambient backscatter and how to control backscatter transmission rate between st and sr .    [ [ extracting - backscatter - information - from - ambient - signals ] ] extracting backscatter information from ambient signals + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we briefly describe the method used by the sr to extract information from the st through the ambient backscatter communication . for more details ,",
    "the readers are referred to  @xcite .",
    "the core idea of backscatter communication is that the st backscatters information at a lower rate than that of ambient signals , e.g. , signals from the pt .",
    "thus , the sr is able to distinguish such two signals by using the averaging mechanisms . in particular",
    ", the authors in  @xcite presented a simple circuit diagram to demodulate the information for the sr .",
    "there are two stages , i.e. , averaging stage and compute threshold stage . in the first stage ,",
    "the sr smooths and averages the natural variations in the pt signals . the output of the averaging stage yields two signal levels , corresponding to the voltage @xmath9 ( bit ` 0 ' ) and the voltage @xmath10 ( bit ` 1 ' ) for @xmath11 .",
    "then , in the second stage , the sr computes the threshold between these two levels , which is the average of the two signal levels , i.e. , @xmath12 . if the received signal is greater than the threshold , the sr concludes that the received signal is @xmath10 , and @xmath9 otherwise .",
    "finally , the comparator takes two voltages as inputs and generates a bit ` 0 ' or ` 1 ' accordingly .",
    "[ [ transmission - rate - of - backscatter - mode ] ] transmission rate of backscatter mode + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    it is shown in  @xcite that the transmission rate of the ambient backscatter communication depends on the setting of the rc circuit elements .",
    "for example , to transmit data at the transmission rate of 1kbps and 10kbps , the values of circuit elements ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , are set at ( 150 @xmath17 , 10 @xmath18 , 4.7 @xmath19 , 10 @xmath19 ) and ( 150 @xmath17 , 10 @xmath18 , 680 @xmath20 , 1 @xmath21 ) , respectively .",
    "therefore , let @xmath22 denote the transmission rate of the ambient backscatter communication , the total number of bits transmitted using the backscatter mode for the rf - powered backscatter crn is expressed as follows : @xmath23 here , we note that through real implementations in  @xcite , when the st backscatters signals to the sr , the st still can harvest energy from rf signals .",
    "although the amount of harvested energy is not enough to transmit data ( when the channel is idle ) , it is sufficient to sustain backscatter operations of the st . therefore , in  ( [ eq : r_b ] )",
    ", there is no need to consider the circuit energy consumption for the backscatter mode .",
    "this mode includes two phases .",
    "first , the st harvests energy from the pt in the energy harvesting period .",
    "then , the st will use the harvested energy to transmit data in the data transmission period . in the following ,",
    "we show the amount of energy that the st can harvest in the first phase and the number of bits transmitted in the second phase .",
