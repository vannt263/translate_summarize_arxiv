    "this paper combines a review of some results on locally finite lie algebras , mostly from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , with new results about categories of representations of a class of ( non - locally finite ) infinite - dimensional lie algebras which we call mackey lie algebras .",
    "locally finite lie algebras ( i.e. lie algebras in which any finite set of elements generates a finite - dimensional lie subalgebra ) and their representations have been gaining the attention of researchers in the past 20 years",
    ". an incomplete list of references in this topic is : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in particular , in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite integrable representations of the three classical locally finite lie algebras @xmath10 have been studied from various points of view .",
    "an important step in the development of the representation theory of these lie algebras has been the introduction of the category of tensor modules @xmath11 in @xcite .    in the present article",
    "we shift the focus to understanding a natural generality in which the category @xmath11 is defined .",
    "in particular , we consider the finitary locally simple lie algebras @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is an arbitrary vector space ( not necessarily of countable dimension ) , and either a non - degenerate pairing @xmath14 is given , or @xmath13 is equipped with a non - degenerate symmetric , or antisymmetric , form . in sections 1 - 5",
    "we reproduce the most important results from @xcite and @xcite in this greater generality .",
    "in fact , we study five different categories of integrable modules , see subsection [ sect:3.6 ] , but pay maximum attention to the category @xmath11 . the central new result in this part of the paper is theorem [ equivmain ] , claiming that the category @xmath11 for @xmath12 is canonically equivalent , as a monoidal category , to the respective category @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that each of the latter categories is koszul and that @xmath7 is self - dual koszul , while @xmath8 and @xmath16 are not self - dual but are equivalent .    in the second part of the paper , starting with section [ sect:6 ] , we explore several new ideas .",
    "the first one is that , given a non - degenerate pairing @xmath14 between two vector spaces , or a non - degenerate symmetric or antisymmetric form on a vector space @xmath13 , there is a canonical , in general non - locally finite , lie algebra attached to this datum . indeed ,",
    "fix a pairing @xmath14 .",
    "then the mackey lie algebra @xmath17 is the lie algebra of all endomorphisms of @xmath13 whose duals keep @xmath18 stable ( this definition is given in a more precise form at the beginning of section [ sect:6 ] ) .",
    "similarly , if @xmath13 is equipped with a non - degenerate form , the respective lie algebra @xmath19 or @xmath20 is the lie algebra of all endomorphisms of @xmath13 for which the form is invariant .",
    "the lie algebras @xmath21 are not simple as they have obvious ideals : these are respectively @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "however , we prove that , if both @xmath13 and @xmath18 are countable dimensional , the quotients @xmath25 are simple lie algebras .",
    "this result is an algebraic analogue of the simplicity of the calkin algebra in functional analysis .    despite the fact that the lie algebras @xmath26 are completely natural objects ,",
    "the representation theory of these lie algebras has not yet been explored .",
    "we are undertaking the first step of such an exploration by introducing the categories of tensor modules @xmath1 for @xmath27 .",
    "our main result about these categories is theorem [ mainres_sect7 ] which implies that @xmath28 is equivalent to @xmath7 , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are equivalent respectively to @xmath8 and @xmath16 .",
    "a further idea is to consider dense subalgebras @xmath9 of the lie algebras @xmath6 ( see the definition in section [ sect:7 ] ) .",
    "we show that if @xmath31 is a dense subalgebra , the category @xmath4 , whose objects are tensor modules of @xmath32 considered as @xmath33modules , is canonically equivalent to @xmath1 , and hence to one of the categories @xmath7 or @xmath8 .",
    "it is interesting that this result applies to the lie algebra of generalized jacobi matrices ( infinite matrices with `` finitely many non - zero diagonals '' ) which has been studied for over 30 years , see for instance @xcite .    in short",
    ", the main point of the present paper is that the categories of tensor modules @xmath34 introduced in @xcite are in some sense universal , being naturally equivalent to the respective categories of tensor representations of a large class of , possibly non - locally finite , infinite - dimensional lie algebras .",
