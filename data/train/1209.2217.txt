    "counting statistics is a scheme to calculate all statistics related to specific transitions in a stochastic system . in the counting statistics , a master equation with discrete states",
    "is used to derive time - evolution equations for generating functions related to the specific transitions .",
    "the scheme has been used to investigate frster resonance energy transfer , and many successful results have been obtained @xcite .",
    "although the scheme is basically formulated for a system with a finite number of states , it is possible to use the scheme to investigate a system with an infinite number of states .",
    "however , as exemplified later , we have non - closed equations in general , so that it would be needed to develop approximation schemes suitable for specific systems . as a first step , it is important to check whether an approximation scheme for the counting statistics is available for the system with an infinite number of states or not .    in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on dynamics in genetic switches .",
    "it has been shown that stochastic behavior plays an important role in gene regulatory systems @xcite , and there are many studies for the stochasticity in the gene regulatory systems from experimental points of view ( e.g. , see @xcite ) and theoretical ones ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "not only studies by numerical simulations , but also those by analytical calculations have been performed .",
    "some analytical expressions for the static properties , i.e. , stationary distributions for the number of proteins or mrnas , have already been obtained .",
    "in addition , in order to investigate the role of the stochasticity in genetic switches , dynamical properties , i.e. , switching behavior between active and inactive gene states , have also been studied .",
    "basically , such dynamical properties have been investigated by numerical simulations ( e.g. , see @xcite ) ; only for a simple system , analytical expressions for the first - passage time distribution have been obtained @xcite .",
    "the genetic switch is described by a master equation with an infinite number of states .",
    "hence , if we can use the scheme of the counting statistics in order to investigate the dynamical properties in the genetic switches , it will be helpful to obtain deeper understanding and intuitive pictures for the genetic switches .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to seek the applicability of the counting statistics in order to investigate the dynamical property in the genetic switches .",
    "it immediately becomes clear that a straightforward application of the counting statistics derives intractable non - closed equations . in order to obtain simple closed forms",
    ", we here employ an effective interaction approximation @xcite . as a result",
    ", we will show that the switching problem can be treated as a simple two - state model approximately .",
    "this result immediately gives us intuitive understanding for the switching behavior and the non - poissonian property .",

    "section [ sec_conclusions ] gives concluding remarks .",
    "a gene regulatory system consists of many components , such as genes , rnas , and proteins . here , a simplified model is used ; mrnas are neglected for simplicity , and an activated gene assumes to directly increase the number of proteins .",
    "in addition , in the simplified model , a repressed gene can not produce any proteins .",
    "the above model has been used to investigate the switching behavior in previous works , and , for example , see @xcite for details of the model .",
    "we summarize the model studied in the present paper in fig .",
    "[ fig_model ] .",
    "the binding interaction is assumed to be a repressed one , and the gene is activated only when the regulatory proteins are not binding the gene .",
    "the proteins are produced from the gene in the active state with rate @xmath0 , and proteins are degraded spontaneously with rate @xmath1 .",
    "the regulatory proteins bind the gene with a rate function @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the number of free proteins .",
    "for example , @xmath4 for a monomer interaction case , and @xmath5 for a dimer interaction case , where @xmath6 is a rate constant for the binding .",
    "@xmath7 is a rate constant with which the regulatory proteins are released from the repressor site of the gene .",
    "we here give short comments for the model from the viewpoint of experiments . using this simplified model",
    ", we can discuss the connection among the model parameters , the number of proteins , and the switching behaviors . while the number of proteins @xmath3 can be observed or estimated experimentally , as far as we know , there has not been an experimental technique to observe the attachment and detachment of the regulatory proteins directly .",
    "we hope that developments of single - molecule observations in future would enable us to give information about the switching dynamics .",
    "analytical treatments for the self - regulating gene system have been developed , and an exact solution is known for the monomer interaction case , i.e. , @xmath4 @xcite . in order to simplify the analytical treatments , an additional assumption has been used in some previous works @xcite ; i.e. , some of proteins are assumed to be inert when the gene state is active .",
    "the inert proteins can not repress the gene , and it is not degraded . for the monomer interaction case , there is only one inert protein ; the number of inert protein for the dimer interaction case is two , and so on .",
    "note that the assumption of the inert proteins does not have physical meanings ; this only simplify the analytical treatments ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "however , it has been shown that this assumption has little influence of the gene system , and then we employ the assumption in the present paper .",

    "it is possible to investigate dynamical properties , i.e. , all statistics for the switching behavior between the active and inactive states . in the present paper , as an example , we calculate the number of transitions from the inactive state to the active state .",
    "the generating functions for the transitions are immediately obtained from the master equations and . a brief explanation of the counting statistics is given in the appendix , and we here give consequences of the counting statistics .    a probability , with which there are @xmath14 transitions from the inactive state to the active state during time @xmath10 , is denoted by @xmath15 .",
