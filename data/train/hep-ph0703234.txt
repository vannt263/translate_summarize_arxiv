    "the current observed neutrino mixing @xcite suggests around the maximal 2 - 3 mixing angle and zero 1 - 3 mixing angle : @xmath1 , @xmath2 .",

    "namely , the tri - bimaximal mixing pattern can be realized naturally in a number of specific models @xcite .",

    "the generic prediction @xcite is that @xmath13 , the quark mixing matrix becomes just the unit matrix . starting with @xmath14 ,",
    "the realistic small quark mixing angles can be generated by extending interactions beyond those of the standard model , such as in supersymmetry @xcite or breaking @xmath0 symmetry explicitly @xcite .",
    "our study is aimed to obtain realistic quark masses and mixing angles entirely within the @xmath0 context @xcite .",
    "it is worthy of mention that the other types of unified models for quarks and leptons with the @xmath0 symmetry @xcite and models which predict tri - bimaximal mixing matrix with @xmath15 symmetry @xcite have been also studied .",
