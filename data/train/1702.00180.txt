    "in random flows , in particular in chaotic or turbulent ones , the increase of the local , instantaneous gradient of a scalar such as temperature or concentration results in the enhancement of mixing through acceleration of molecular diffusion .",
    "this `` gradient production '' is caused by the mechanical action of the velocity gradient , more precisely by its straining part , either in the pure straining motion of hyperbolic regions or in the vicinity of vortices where strain stems from differential rotation .",
    "quite equivalently , at least as far as only convective mechanisms are considered , hastening of the mixing process in random flows finds expression in the stretching of material surface areas . in turbulent",
    "flows the growth of the scalar gradient is closely connected to the production of small scales of a scalar field and to cascade phenomena . actually , the mean dissipation rate of the energy of fluctuations of a scalar is proportional to the variance of its fluctuating gradient .    in the view",
    "where mixing properties of flows are explained through the evolution of the gradient of a scalar the key mechanisms rest on the alignment of the gradient with respect to the local strain principal axes @xcite .",
    "the rise of the scalar gradient is indeed promoted by alignment with the most compressive direction of strain .",
    "but the general problem of scalar gradient alignment is quite complicated . in turbulent",
    "flows the question amounts to understanding how the gradient behaves under the combined actions of molecular diffusion as well as of fluctuating strain and effective rotation ( i.e. vorticity plus strain basis rotation ) . in three - dimensional turbulence random alignment of vorticity and vorticity / strain interaction",
    "make the problem even more complex .    from pure kinematical considerations it is obvious that in incompressible flows the scalar gradient is drawn by the local compressional direction .",
    "yet it is also quite understandable that the latter is generally not the equilibrium orientation of the scalar gradient . in other words , when not only strain but also rotation and , possibly , molecular diffusion are present , the fixed point of the gradient orientation equations is certainly not the strain compressional axis . in three - dimensional flows ,",
    "the bare existence of this fixed point is even not proved in the general case @xcite . in two - dimensional flows",
    "@xcite as well as in a special , three - dimensional situation @xcite , however , the equilibrium orientation and conditions for its existence have been derived analytically at least when the scalar is non - diffusive .",
    "it has also been shown that in two - dimensional turbulence the scalar gradient statistically aligns better with the local equilibrium direction defined by the balance between strain and rotation than with the compressional direction @xcite .",
    "even so , the statistical alignment of the scalar gradient is determined by the gradient dynamics . if the velocity field is time varying , alignment with a possible equilibrium orientation requires that the response time scale of the scalar gradient is short enough compared to the time scale of velocity gradient fluctuations .",
    "alignment dynamics is thus an essential feature of the scalar gradient behaviour and has already been addressed in some studies @xcite .",
    "the influence on mixing that follows from this nonstationary aspect is still not clear .",
    "trying to understand how the mixing process is affected by the dynamics of the scalar gradient is precisely one of the main goals of the present study .",
    "this is done in section [ sec3 ] by analyzing numerically the growth rate of the gradient norm for different unsteady regimes in the two - dimensional case .",
    "we first devote section [ sec2 ] to the numerical analysis of alignment statistics when the scalar gradient undergoes a fluctuating strain persistence .",
    "this investigation aims at bearing out the generality of the partial findings of ref . @xcite .",
    "in particular , the orientation equation of the scalar gradient in a two - dimensional flow is solved for simulating the strain - dominated as well as the effective - rotation - dominated regimes .",

    "garcia et al . @xcite",
    "have shown that the approach of lapeyre et al .",
    "@xcite ( section [ sec2.1 ] ) does not apply to scalar gradient orientation if strain persistence fluctuates too rapidly for the scalar gradient to respond .",

    "results for the hyperbolic regime are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . plainly , @xmath39 ( which is computed as @xmath54 ) is the most probable orientation of the scalar gradient .",

    "[ fig4 ] ) , too , the orientation defined by @xmath25 is statistically the best one . as a matter of course",
    ", the gradient does not align with the compressional direction , but there is also no trend at all toward the direction defined by @xmath50 .",
    "with the same assumptions as those stated in section [ sec2.1 ] the equation for the norm of the scalar gradient is @xcite @xmath56 from which it is clear that the mean growth rate of the gradient norm , @xmath57 , is given by @xmath58 .",
    "note that alignment with the compressional direction , @xmath59 , corresponds to the maximum growth rate .",
    "the mean growth rate has been derived from the statistics of @xmath40 computed by solving eqs .",

    "figure [ fig5 ] shows the evolution of @xmath57 _ vs. _ @xmath62 .",
    "interestingly , @xmath57 decreases with @xmath62 whatever the value of @xmath63 ; in other words , the better the response of gradient orientation to @xmath12 fluctuations ( large values of @xmath62 ) , the lower the mean growth rate of the norm . when it responds to @xmath12 fluctuations the scalar gradient preferentially aligns with either @xmath20 or @xmath50 which are determined by the instantaneous value of @xmath12 and are both mostly different from the compressional direction ( section [ sec2.2 ] ) . hence the weaker growth rate .",
    "this feature gets more pronounced as the variance @xmath63 is increased . for the lowest variance ( @xmath64 )",
    "@xmath12 mostly fluctuates within the bounds of the hyperbolic regime assuming low values around @xmath19 and makes @xmath20 not much different from the compressional direction .",
    "wider fluctuations ( @xmath42 or @xmath61 ) , by contrast , bring about instantaneous orientations @xmath20 corresponding to larger values of @xmath65 and thus lying further from the compressional direction ; in addition , more frequent , deep inroads into the elliptic regime ( @xmath16 ) even lead the gradient to align with @xmath50 , that is , @xmath66 away from the compressional direction , during longer time intervals . as a result , for moderate and large values of @xmath62 the mean growth rate of the scalar gradient norm",
    "is lowered as the amplitude of @xmath12 fluctuations is increased . for the smallest values of @xmath62 , though , the growth rate is insensitive to @xmath12 variance and is close to its maximum value . indeed a sluggish response to @xmath12 fluctuations compels the gradient to remain aligned with the direction defined by @xmath25 ( section [ sec2.2 ] ) which in the present case ( for which @xmath41 ) coincides with the compressional direction .",
    "there is an interesting consequence for mixing properties . if @xmath67 , then favourable conditions for mixing are not only achieved in the hyperbolic regime ; provided that the gradient response is weak , they are also fulfiled in those cases where large fluctuations of @xmath12 span both the hyperbolic and elliptic regimes .",
    "more generally , when @xmath12 fluctuates with @xmath25 remaining close to 0 it is the poor response of the scalar gradient to @xmath12 fluctuations that promotes the best conditions for fast mixing .",
    "as far as we know , simultaneous measurements of velocity and scalar gradients are scarce . apart from experiments in turbulent flows @xcite",
    ", joint statistics of velocity gradient and temperature gradient have been measured in a low - reynolds number , two - dimensional , bnard - von krmn street @xcite .",
    "the latter data confirm that for fast fluctuations of strain persistence the preferential orientation of the scalar gradient is determined by the mean strain persistence rather than by its instantaneous value .",
    "a detailed description of the experiment and measurement techniques are given in refs .",
    "@xcite . in brief , the experimental set - up consists of a 2 mm - diameter ( @xmath68 ) circular cylinder used for generating a two - dimensional bnard - von krmn street ; the reynolds number based on the cylinder diameter is @xmath69 .",
    "temperature is passively injected through a 20 @xmath70m - diameter heated line source located in the near wake of the cylinder ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) . the line source can be set either in or off the centre of the street .",
    "velocity gradients and temperature gradients are derived from simultaneous measurements of temperature and velocity components .",
    "these data have been used to obtain lagrangian statistics of the scalar gradient orientation conditioned on the strain persistence parameter , @xmath12 , as explained in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "part of the latter results have been already analyzed @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been found that in this experiment the temperature gradient does not respond to @xmath12 fluctuations .",
    "more precisely , @xmath71 , where the mean value of strain , @xmath72 , and @xmath36 , the autocorrelation time scale of @xmath12 , have been computed by averaging over lagrangian trajectories .",
    "this previous statistical study was mainly focused on the hyperbolic zones of the flow , far enough downstream ( i.e. @xmath73 with @xmath74 the distance of the source to the cylinder ) , when the heated line source is in the centre of the cylinder wake .",
    "the analysis showed ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) that the alignment of the temperature gradient with the compressional direction is statistically better than with the equilibrium direction derived from the approach of lapeyre et al .",
    "@xcite ( section [ sec2.1 ] ) .",
    "this result lends support to the findings of the numerical study presented in section [ sec2.2 ] .",
    "most likely , preferential alignment of the temperature gradient with the compressional direction does not result from any kinematic attraction , but from the gradient dynamics .",
    "because of the poor response of the temperature gradient to @xmath12 fluctuations , the preferential alignment is given by @xmath25 computed along lagrangian trajectories which , in the above conditions , is found to be close to 0 and thus defines an orientation that almost coincides with the compressional direction .",
    "previous studies @xcite suggest that molecular diffusion may influence scalar gradient orientation , but that large gradients are weakly affected . as to the present case , garcia et al . @xcite",
    "have shown that the departure of the experimental results from the lapeyre et al .",
    "approach is not to be ascribed to molecular diffusion .",
    "the latter certainly plays on the shape of the orientation p.d.fs , but is not the cause for the compressional direction being more probable than the equilibrium one .",
    "further experimental data for the elliptic regions of the flow and in the case where the line source is located off the centre of the cylinder wake confirm the above picture .",
    "results for elliptic regions when the line source is in the centre of the wake are displayed in fig .",
    "they concern the p.d.fs of orientation of the temperature gradient with respect to the compressional direction , @xmath75 , and to direction @xmath50 imposed by dominating effective rotation @xcite ( section [ sec2.1 ] ) .",
    "the p.d.f of orientation with respect to direction @xmath76 is also shown .",
    "the latter direction corresponds to the lowest eigenvalue of tensor @xmath77 which is defined as : @xmath78 and is related to the pressure hessian @xcite .",
    "according to klein et al .",
    "@xcite , when strain intensity varies significantly along lagrangian trajectories @xmath76 is the preferential orientation of the scalar gradient in effective - rotation - dominated regions . from fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] it is clear that the temperature gradient does not tend to align with @xmath50 . there is a trend of the gradient to align with @xmath76 , but the best alignment is with the compressional direction .",
    "this striking behaviour strongly pleads for the above - described scenario and for the conclusions of the numerical analysis of section [ sec2.2 ] : when strain persistence fluctuations are too fast for the scalar gradient to respond ( which in the experiment is measured by the low value of @xmath79 ) the latter is blind to the local topology and its orientation is entirely governed by the mean value of the strain persistence parameter .",
    "when the heated line source is set off the centre of the bnard - von krmn street ( more precisely , at transversal distance @xmath80 from the previous position ) the mean value @xmath25 of strain persistence computed for lagrangian trajectories along which the temperature gradient keeps significant values ( @xmath81 ) is found to be close to -0.8 .",
    "figure [ fig9 ] shows the p.d.fs of temperature gradient orientation with respect to either the compressional direction or the equilibrium direction , @xmath20 , derived from the approach of lapeyre et al .",
    "@xcite , in strain - dominated regions .",
    "there is a trend of the gradient to align with @xmath20 .",
    "however , a much better statistical alignment is found with the direction corresponding to @xmath82 , that is , with @xmath83 .",
    "p.d.fs of fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] are more distributed and thus display lower peaks than those corresponding to the source being in the centre of the cylinder wake ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "this may result from a bigger influence of rotation on the temperature gradient when the line source is off the centre of the wake .",
    "orientation statistics in effective - rotation - dominated regions have similar trends .",
    "figure [ fig10 ] shows that the temperature gradient aligns slightly better with @xmath76 than with @xmath50 .",
    "but in this case , too , the best statistical alignment ",
    "broader though the p.d.f is  is found around @xmath84 . these latter experimental data with @xmath85",
    "thus give a more general support to the previous findings on the dynamics of scalar gradient orientation .",
    "analysis of the behaviour of the passive scalar gradient undergoing the influence of varying velocity derivatives through fluctuating strain persistence uncovers some interesting results regarding both the statistical gradient orientation and mixing properties .    generalizing the analysis of garcia et al .",
    "@xcite to the effective - rotation - dominated regime , we confirm that the statistics of scalar gradient alignment depend on the gradient response to strain persistence fluctuations .",
    "more precisely , the numerical study based on the equation for the scalar gradient orientation in two - dimensional flow shows that perfect response drives the gradient to preferentially align with a direction determined by the instantaneous value of strain persistence as predicted by the analysis of lapeyre et al . @xcite .",
    "when the response of the scalar gradient is poor , though , the preferential alignment is given by the mean value of strain persistence which indicates whether the flow regime is , on an average , either strain- or effective - rotation - dominated .",
    "it follows interestingly that the scalar gradient preferentially aligns with the compressional direction provided that it is almost insensitive to strain persistence fluctuations and the mean strain persistence is close to the pure hyperbolic value .",
    "this result opposes the usual statement that it is a perfect response to the fluctuating rotation of the strain basis ( which in the two - dimensional case is explicit in the strain persistence parameter ) that leads the gradient to align with the compressional direction .    the general picture derived from the numerical study is firmly supported by experimental , lagrangian joint statistics of velocity gradient and scalar gradient derived from simultaneous measurements of velocity and temperature in a two - dimensional , low - reynolds number bnard - von krman street .",
    "it is worth noting that its low reynolds number marks this flow from the simulated two - dimensional turbulent flows in which scalar gradient alignment was previously studied @xcite . in particular , it may be that alignment with the equilibrium direction found by lapeyre et al .",
    "@xcite results from a good response of the scalar gradient to @xmath12 fluctuations in turbulent flows ( moderate or large @xmath86 ) . checking this surmise",
    "would require lagrangian data on strain persistence in two - dimensional turbulence .",
    "regarding the lagrangian properties of strain persistence and scalar gradient dynamics , another interesting and unanswered issue is whether the present flow is a special one or belongs to a more general class of flows .",
    "finally , unsteady behaviour of the scalar gradient may unexpectably affect mixing properties through alignment statistics .",
    "an interesting result is that poor response of the gradient to strain persistence fluctuations does not inevitably oppose efficient mixing .",
    "in particular , the study of the growth rate of the gradient norm clearly shows that when the mean strain persistence is close to the pure hyperbolic value ( in other words , strain is persistent on an average ) it is the weak response of the gradient to strain persistence fluctuations which promotes the highest growth rate and thus the best conditions for mixing .",
    "we restrict to the case where @xmath37 and @xmath87 is defined .",
    "we get rid of the nonlinearity of eq .",
    "( [ eqa1 ] ) by assuming small values of @xmath92 . to first order , then : @xmath93 with @xmath94 .",
    "the proof is thus not general , but is given as an additional argument for the behaviour of the scalar gradient when its response to @xmath12 fluctuations is poor .",
    "we assume a sine signal for @xmath29 , @xmath95 , in which frequency is normalized as @xmath96 with @xmath97 .",
    "the nondimensional frequency , @xmath98 , thus gives a measure of the response of the scalar gradient to @xmath12 fluctuations .",
    "in particular , poor response is expected for large values of @xmath98 .    the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eqa2 ] ) is : @xmath99 \\exp(-\\gamma \\tau ) + \\frac{a}{\\gamma(1 + { \\omega^{\\star}}^2/\\gamma^2 ) } \\left(\\sin \\omega^ * \\tau - \\frac{\\omega^{\\star}}{\\gamma }                         \\cos \\omega^{\\star } \\tau \\right).\\ ] ]    note that eq .",
    "( [ eqa3 ] ) can be recast in the more standard form : @xmath100 \\exp(-\\gamma \\tau ) + \\frac{a}{\\gamma{(1+{\\omega^{\\star}}^2/\\gamma^2)}^{1/2 } }    \\sin(\\omega^{\\star } \\tau - \\phi)\\ ] ] with @xmath101 and phase , @xmath102 , is present when the response to the stimulation is not perfect .",
    "it follows that when @xmath12 fluctuates on a much shorter time scale than the response time scale of the scalar gradient so much so that the latter does not keep up with @xmath12 fluctuations the gradient orientation , @xmath40 , remains close to @xmath39 .",
    "increasing the amplitude of @xmath12 fluctuations , however , leads to the opposite behaviour .",

    "<S> the dynamics of a passive scalar gradient experiencing fluctuating velocity gradient through the lagrangian variations of strain persistence is studied . </S>",
    "<S> to this end , a systematic , numerical analysis based on the equation for the orientation of the gradient of a non - diffusive scalar in two - dimensional flow is performed . </S>",
    "<S> when the gradient responds weakly its orientation properties are determined by the mean value of strain persistence . </S>",
    "<S> statistical alignment of the scalar gradient with the direction defined by the opposed actions of strain and rotation , by contrast , requires the gradient to keep up with strain persistence fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> these results have been obtained for both strain- and effective - rotation - dominated regimes and are supported by relevant experimental data . </S>",
