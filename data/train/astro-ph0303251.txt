    "ngc  4449 is a nearby magellanic dwarf irregular starburst galaxy which has an inclination of 56.2@xmath17 and a mass of @xmath18  @xmath19 ( bajaja et al .",
    "1994 - mass has been scaled for our assumed distance which is discussed later ) . as such it allows another opportunity for the study of the starburst phenomenon and its effect on galaxy evolution in the local universe .",
    "dwarf galaxies as the basic building blocks in the hierarchical merging cosmology scenario are likely to have harboured the earliest sites of star - formation in the universe and so their study in the local universe can give insight into the evolution of such objects at high redshift .",
    "observations of local edge - on starburst galaxies ( strickland et al .",
    "2000 ; weaver 2001 ) are presenting a picture of kpc - scale , soft x - ray emitting , bi - polar outflows in the form of galactic winds transporting mass , newly synthesized heavy elements and energy into the igm .",
    "these winds result from the pressure driven outflows along these galaxy s minor axis produced from the efficient thermalization of the mechanical energy from the supernovae ( sn ) explosions and stellar winds of the massive stars in their ob associations and super star clusters ( ssc ) .",
    "inclined galaxies such as ngc  4449 containing such phenomena present a less clearly observable picture .",
    "however , observations of how absorption and temperature of the diffuse x - ray emission varies within them and links between h@xmath11 , hi and x - ray morphology suggest a similar scenario also applies to these objects .",
    "ngc  4449 has been observed across the electromagnetic spectrum and displays some both interesting and unusual characteristics .",
    "radio observations have shown it to contain an extremely luminous snr ( bignell & seaquist 1983 ) , have a very extended hi halo ( @xmath20  kpc in radius ) which appears to be rotating in the opposite direction to the gas in the core of the galaxy ( bajaja et al .",
    "1994 ) and to have a large - scale ordered magnetic field ( klein et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "the angular velocity of the rotation of the gas in the centre of the galaxy is low ( @xmath21  km  s@xmath2 hunter et al . 1998 ) , suggesting a low escape velocity but the huge hi halo may prevent escape of the hot ejecta of the starburst region from the galaxy as a whole .",
    "the galaxy has both a high star - formation rate ( @xmath22  m@xmath23  yr@xmath2 , thronson jr .",
    "et al . 1987 ) and supernova rate , contains numerous star clusters ( @xmath24 , gelatt et al .",
    "2001 ) with the central one appearing to be young ( @xmath25  myr bker et al .",
    "2001 ) and a spherical distribution of older stars with a mean age of @xmath26  gyr ( bothun 1986 ) .",
    "it has also been shown to contain molecular cloud complexes from co observations ( hunter & thronson jr .",
    "1996 ) and has an infra - red luminosity ( @xmath27  @xmath28 m ) of @xmath29  erg  s@xmath2 ( thronson jr .",
    "1987 , corrected for the distance assumed here - see below ) .",
    "the ionised gas it contains shows a very disturbed morphology and includes what appear to be many h@xmath30 bubbles , shells and filaments ( hunter & gallagher 1990 ; 1997 ) .",
    "the kinematics of the hii regions within the galaxy are very chaotic and could be the aftermath of a collision or merger ( hartmann et al . 1986 ) .",
    "there is a gas - rich companion galaxy lying at a projected distance of @xmath31  kpc , coincident in projection with the outer edge of the extended hi halo , which could have been involved .",
    "previous x - ray observations of this galaxy have detected the presence of discrete emission from point sources and diffuse emission from hot gas ( della ceca et al .",
    "1997 ; vogler & pietsch 1997 ) .",
    "the distance to ngc  4449 is not well established and ranges from @xmath32  mpc ( karachentsev & drozdovsky 1998 ) to @xmath33  mpc ( aaronson & mould 1983 ) .",
    "we have chosen to adopt the lower value throughout this analysis as optical observations are showing objects within ngc  4449 to be resolved ( whiting 2002 , private communication ) suggesting a lower distance estimate to be more appropriate .    in section 2",
    "we describe the _ chandra _ observation .",
    "the x - ray emission from the point sources is discussed in section 3 and that from the diffuse emission is considered in section 4 .",
    "section 5 contains a more general discussion of the relationship of the x - ray emission to that from other wavebands , the affects of the out - flow of the x - ray emission on ngc  4449 and the morphology of the x - ray emission , whilst our main conclusions are summarized in section 6 .",
    "a 30  ks observation of ngc  4449 was obtained on feb @xmath34 2001 .",
    "analysis was carried out on the data contained within the s3 chip of the acis@xmath35s instrument on board _ chandra _ using _ ciao _ ( version 2.2.1 ) , _ heasoft _ ( version 5.1 ) , _ xspec _ ( version 11.1.0 ) and _ asterix _ ( version 2.3-b1 ) .",
    "the data were reprocessed ( caldb version 2.9 ) and filtered to remove periods of flaring and lower than average count rates using the @xmath36 clipping technique of the lc@xmath37clean.sl script ( available from the _ chandra _ website ) . after these processes were completed , a total of 22.12  ks of useful data remained .",
    "the data were then further filtered to contain data in the energy band from @xmath38  kev ( amounting to a total of @xmath39 counts on the s3 chip , of which @xmath40 come from within the @xmath41 ellipse and of these @xmath42 are due to diffuse emission ) and were also background subtracted using the appropriately scaled cxc background event data set .",
    "( the one utilized for this observation had a total exposure of 137391s . ) after production of an exposure map , the point sources present in the data were detected using the _ wavdetect _ tool , contained in the _ ciao _ software , run with an exposure map , default wavlet scales of 2.0 and 4.0 pixels and a source significance threshold of @xmath43 , a value of @xmath44  ( number of pixels)@xmath2 which should have limited the number of false detections to @xmath45 .",
    "32 point sources were detected and these are shown in fig .  [ sources ] overlaid on a smoothed image of the s3 chip ( smoothed with a gaussian having a fwhm of 4 pixels @xmath46 ) , while their positions and background subtracted count rates are listed in table  1 .",
    "of these 32 sources , 8 do not lie within the optical extent of the galaxy , as measured by the @xmath41 ellipse ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) , also shown in fig .",
    "[ sources ] .",
    "the 24 sources within the optical extent of the galaxy are the ones most likely to be associated with ngc  4449 and so are the only ones considered further in this analysis . in comparison ,",
    "when the data were point source searched using _ celldetect _ with an exposure map and default settings , only 18 sources were detected on the s3 chip .",
    "it was obvious from visual inspection of the data that several significant sources were missed by _",
    "celldetect_. in addition on comparison with expected source counts from , ` the _ chandra _ deep field north survey ' ( brandt et al .",
    "2001 ) , we would expect @xmath47 background sources on the s3-chip at our level of completeness ( see section 3.1 for further details ) . for these reasons",
    ", we would expect more than the 18 sources detected by _ celldetect _ and so the results from _ wavdetect _ have been adopted as being more reliable .",
    ".positions and count rates of the 32 sources detected in the ngc  4449 _ chandra _ s3 chip data .",
    "column 1 is the source number ordered in increasing r.a .. columns 2 and 3 give the r.a . and",
    "of each source and column 4 lists their background subtracted count rates . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     these results are not very conclusive but do suggest a reduced column density in a region running from north to south across the centre of the galaxy and also across the northern edge and into the north - east of the galaxy . the temperature of the softer thermal components seem to be highest in the north of the galaxy and in an arc running south across the centre of the galaxy and into the south - east .",
    "the hardness ratios suggest that generally , the emission is slightly higher in the @xmath48  kev energy band than in the @xmath49  kev band .",
    "looking at the soft , medium and hard energy band images ( @xmath48  kev , @xmath49  kev and @xmath50  kev respectively ) , a difference can be seen between the spatial distribution of the extended diffuse emission in these 3 bands , ( fig .",
    "[ softmed ] ) .",
    "these bands were originally chosen to have roughly equal counts in the 3 bands and they highlight the relative contributions made by the diffuse emission and point sources to the different bands . surprisingly , the @xmath48  kev band image shows the diffuse emission to be extending to the west of the galaxy into regions where the spectral fits gave some of the highest column densities .",
    "such high absorption should reduce the soft thermal emission and suggests that the single temperature fits in these regions are not the best models .",
    "it is worth noting here that when two temperature models were fitted to regions 1 , 2 and 3 , lower column densities were obtained but none of the results were well constrained .    to obtain a clearer picture of the distribution of peaks in the x - ray emission ,",
    "surface brightness slices were taken across the galaxy in 4 directions ( n to s , nw to se , w to e and sw to ne ) , centred on the trough of the x - ray emission in the centre of the galaxy at @xmath51 , @xmath52 with a length of @xmath53 and a width of @xmath54 .",
    "the positions of these slices are overlaid on the h@xmath11 image of ngc  4449 ( kindly supplied by deidre a. hunter ) shown in fig .",
    "[ slice_pos ] .",
    "in addition surface brightness profiles were also taken from the h@xmath11 image using the same slices .",
    "the resulting profiles from these slices are shown in fig .",
    "[ slices ] , with those from the diffuse x - ray emission , shown by the crosses and dashed curves , overlaid on those from the h@xmath11 emission ( solid curves ) .",
    "although the x - ray data has been point source subtracted , the h@xmath11 data has not .",
    "there is very little correlation between the positions of the resolved x - ray point sources and the numerous hii regions seen in the h@xmath11 data and so the slices are being used to look for association of the diffuse x - ray emission with the star - forming regions . see section 5.1.2 for further discussion .",
    "it is apparent from fig .",
    "[ softmed ] that the hardest ( @xmath55  kev ) fraction of the diffuse emission is confined to the central region of the galaxy along a ridge running from nne to the centre .",
    "this is in the same direction as the orientation of the major axis of the galaxy .",
    "the medium ( @xmath49  kev ) diffuse emission is less extended than the soft ( @xmath56  kev ) emission with the most intense regions of emission in both these bands being coincident with the regions where the highest density of star clusters is seen ( as identified by gelatt et al .",
    "2001 ) , suggesting that this emission is associated with the increased star - formation occurring in these regions .",
    "the less intense bulging of the emission seen to the ese and wnw could be indicative of a bipolar outflow along the minor axis of the galaxy as would be expected from standard superbubble models ( weaver et al .",
    "the higher column densities seen in table  6 and fig  [ maps ] for the regions to the se , sw and w of the galaxy would suggest that these areas lie behind more absorbing material present in the disk of the galaxy and that the eastern and northern edges of the galaxy are tilted towards us as shown in the cartoon representation of the galaxy s morphology in fig .",
    "[ morph ] . allowing for ngc  4449 s position angle",
    ", this would mean the minor axis lies inclined to our line - of - sight ( tilted both to the n and w ) consistent with ngc  4449 being a magellanic irregular that is inclined at @xmath57 to our line - of - sight .",
    "the lower column density of region 3 , in particular , would suggest that the x - ray emission in that region comes from material lying above the galactic disk .",
    "the galaxy contains many star clusters spread through - out the @xmath41 ellipse and so star - formation is not confined to a single well - defined region within the galaxy .",
    "the highest density of star clusters identified by gelatt et al .",
    "( 2001 ) is coincident with the peak seen in the diffuse x - ray emission at @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "( the largest of the contours labelled 3 in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ hax ] . )",
    "the peak in the diffuse emission to the sw of this at @xmath60 and @xmath61 also has a large number of star clusters associated with it .",
    "it is likely that multiple superbubbles are being blown by the combined action of stellar winds and sn explosions from the individual stars within these star clusters , leading to the increased diffuse x - ray emission from hot , shock - heated gas in these regions .",
    "this is supported by the complex morphology seen in the patterns of peaks in the x - ray emission shown in fig .",
    "[ slices ] .      fig .",
    "[ hax ] shows x - ray contours overlaid on an h@xmath11 map of ngc  4449 as well as the two separate images .",
    "this shows that the x - ray and h@xmath11 morphologies in the main body of the galaxy follow each other closely .",
    "the x - ray emission is also seen to extend out to the nw into what appears to be a hole in the h@xmath11 emission , bounded by filaments , labelled f in the lower panel .",
    "this could be a wind - blown super - bubble or the escape of hot gas from a ruptured bubble in the form of a super - wind , labelled sb / sw .",
    "ultra - violet observations ( hill et al . , 1998 ) have identified regions along the north - eastern edge of this hole which show sequential star - formation and this activity may be linked to the expansion of a super - bubble . as the bubble expands , it sweeps up and shock heats the ism , leading to the formation of areas of increased density which can trigger star - formation .",
    "in addition , the observed filamentary structure seen in h@xmath11 could be material from a ruptured bubble or entrained ism material caught up in an outflow . a similar ,",
    "if less pronounced effect also seems to be occurring to the se , labelled sb .",
    "the extent of both emissions matches well , as can be seen by comparing the x - ray and h@xmath11 surface brightness slices shown for the same regions in fig .",
    "[ slices ] .",
    "the only exception seems to occur to the west of the galaxy where the diffuse x - ray emission appears to extend beyond the region of high h@xmath11 intensity .",
    "for the n to s and sw to ne slices , the overall profiles of the peaks are similar and they occupy a similar extent .",
    "the peaks of x - ray emission , in the northern half of these slices , tend to fall inside the peaks of h@xmath11 emission ( i.e. they are slightly closer to the centre of the galaxy ) , with the intensity of the x - ray emission , in the n , being greatest close to the h@xmath11 peaks .",
    "this is the type of behaviour discussed by strickland et al .",
    "( 2002 ) in model 5 of the connection between x - ray and h@xmath11 emission , where the h@xmath11 emission is attributed to a swept - up shell that has cooled , and surrounds a hot bubble of sn - ejecta .",
    "these potential bubbles in the n of the galaxy , labelled b in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ hax ] , have diameters @xmath62  kpc and the most northern of the two does appear to be surrounded by an arc of increased intensity in the h@xmath11 emission , most clearly visible in the upper left panel of fig .",
    "the increased intensity of the x - ray emission behind the h@xmath11 peaks would be due to conductive evaporation of the swept - up material , which increases the density and x - ray emissivity of the region where the hot gas and evaporated material mixes ( weaver et al .",
    "these two slices lie closest to the major axis of the galaxy and cut across the regions containing the highest densities of star clusters in the southern half of the galaxy .",
    "the association of the peaks is less clear on the south side of both of these slices and this may well be a result of the overlapping and merging of many wind - blown bubbles from the large number of star clusters found there .",
    "the slices running from nw to se and w to e lie closest to the minor axis of the galaxy and cut across the bulging of the diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "the slices show what appear to be cavities in the h@xmath11 emission to both the nw and the e which are filled with x - ray emission , again suggesting the presence of wind - blown super - bubbles , while to the se and w , the x - ray emission seems to lie outside the h@xmath11 emission , more suggestive of ruptured super - bubbles , particularly to the west as seen by the distribution of x - ray contours , labelled 1 , in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ hax ] .",
    "the hi halo of ngc  4449 extends out to a radius of @xmath31  kpc ( bajaja et al .",
    "1994 ) and its outer structure takes the form of enormous filaments and clouds ( hunter et al .",
    "the vla observations of hunter et al .",
    "( 1998 ; 1999 ) , show that the inner regions consist of a concentration of gas centred on the optical galaxy that takes the form of seven large hi complexes embedded in a lower density background , with the overall outline of the morphology bulging to the ese and wnw as seen in the diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "12 of hunter et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , shows that the hi in the inner regions extends beyond the h@xmath11 filament seen to the wnw in fig .",
    "[ hax ] and beyond the bulge in the diffuse x - ray emission to the ese .",
    "this could be indicative of the swept up , compressed ambient interstellar medium lying outside the shells of two expanding super - bubbles .",
    "the regions of increased x - ray emission seen in the main body of the galaxy as well as lying close to regions of increased h@xmath11 emission also occupy areas where three of the hi clouds lie .",
    "this is suggestive of the increased hi density in these regions being caused by outflows from star clusters sweeping - up and compressing the ism .",
    "the overall extent of the inner hi concentration is @xmath63  kpc and it is embedded in an elliptical region of lower concentration with a major axis of @xmath20  kpc from which streamers extend . by comparison , the extent of the diffuse x - ray emitting region is @xmath64  kpc along the major axis of the optical galaxy and @xmath65  kpc in an approximate ese  wnw direction .",
    "the optical extent of the galaxy as measured by the @xmath41 ellipse is @xmath66  kpc by @xmath67  kpc .",
    "counter rotation is observed between the hi gas within the central region and that outside with the rotation velocity of the inner gas being @xmath68  km  s@xmath2 and that of the streamers seen in the halo @xmath69  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "these two velocities and the distribution of the hi gas have implications for the potential of the hot gas , contained within any super - bubbles to escape . modelling the potential of the galaxy as a simple spherically - symmetric , truncated , isothermal potential ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) then the escape velocity at a distance @xmath70 from the centre of the galaxy is given by :    @xmath71^{1/2}\\;\\;\\;{\\rm km~s}^{-1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath72 is the maximum rotation velocity of the galaxy in km  s@xmath2 and @xmath73 is the radius at which the potential is truncated . if the potential is truncated at the edge of the inner hi concentration at @xmath74  kpc then the escape velocity for the hot x - ray emitting gas at @xmath75  kpc from the centre , assuming @xmath76  km  s@xmath2 would be @xmath77  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "this is an upper limit as the value will decrease when the extent of the hot gas is deprojected . a similar calculation for the potential truncated at the edge of the hi halo at @xmath20  kpc , with @xmath78  km  s@xmath2 gives an upper value for @xmath79  km  s@xmath2 . in the absence of radiative cooling",
    ", hot gas can escape the galaxy s potential if its temperature is greater than :    @xmath80    where @xmath81 is the temperature required for the gas to exceed the galaxy s escape velocity and @xmath82 is the escape velocity in units of @xmath83  km  s@xmath2 ( martin 1999 ) .",
    "the two escape velocities determined above have corresponding escape temperatures of @xmath84  k and @xmath85  k respectively . from the gas parameters given in table  5 both the soft and medium components of the hot gas",
    "have temperatures in excess of these values .",
    "eventual escape of the metal - enriched sn ejecta contained within the super - bubbles seems possible for ngc  4449 but the distribution of the gas in the galaxy s extended halo could be as important as gravity in controlling whether the hot gas escapes or not .",
    "the presence of streamers of hi rather than an homogeneous distribution of material can facilitate the escape of hot gas through the gaps between the streamers .",
    "the 5  ghz vla observation ( bignell & seaquist 1983 ) identifies the known snr ( source 15 ) in ngc  4449 with the most intense peak of the radio emission .",
    "the next 3 most intense peaks on this radio observation also lie close to sources in our data ( sources 10 , 18 and 23 ) that have all been flagged as possible snrs , although none convincingly .",
    "in addition , these radio peaks are coincident with the three brightest peaks of emission on the h@xmath11 map , where intense star - formation is occurring and where the presence of snrs in star clusters is to be expected .",
    "the presence of what appears to be a developing super - wind in this dwarf galaxy can have dramatic effects on its evolution .",
    "the lower gravitational potential of dwarfs makes the possibility of losing newly synthesized metals and swept - up ism material more likely . as such it is worth considering the impact that the western super - bubble / super - wind might have on ngc  4449 .",
    "the position of the super - bubble suggests that its origins may lie in 3 ob associations identified by hill et al . (",
    "1994 ) , that lie in the sw region of the main body of the galaxy where the highest density of star clusters is seen .",
    "the ages of these 3 ob associations were found to be , 5.9 , 6.2 and 6.7  myr while their corresponding masses were @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88  @xmath19 .",
    "the extent that the diffuse emission extends from the position of these ob associations is @xmath89 or 1.4  kpc for our assumed distance down to a flux density level of @xmath90  erg  s@xmath2  @xmath3  arcmin@xmath4 .",
    "assuming an average age for the ob associations of 6.3  myr then to have travelled this distance the expansion velocity of the bubble has to be @xmath12  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "this will be an underestimate since the deprojected distance will be greater than that assumed and also the presence of a density gradient in the halo above the disk of the galaxy will lead to acceleration of the super - wind .",
    "further , from the calculated gas temperature of the soft component of the emission given in table 5 , a simple energy conservation analysis would give the average speed of a particle to be @xmath91  km  s@xmath2 , which is in good agreement .",
    "at these sorts of velocities , it would take @xmath92  myr for the super - wind to reach a distance of 40  kpc and so escape the hi halo .",
    "this is of the same order as the radiative cooling time for the soft component of the diffuse emission and again suggests that ngc  4449 s huge hi halo may allow it to retain its newly synthesized metals and ism .",
    "the likelihood that the hi halo will prevent blowout is also found when the criterion for blow - out defined by mac low & mccray ( 1988 ) is applied to ngc  4449 .",
    "this is based on the parameter @xmath93 , defined as the dimensionless rate of kinetic energy injection , given by :    @xmath94    where @xmath95 is the mechanical energy luminosity in units of @xmath10  erg  s@xmath2 , @xmath96 is the galaxy scale - height in kpc , @xmath97 is the initial pressure of the ism in units of @xmath98  k  @xmath99 and @xmath100 its initial density . for blow - out to occur",
    ", the condition @xmath101 has to be satisfied . for the whole of the x - ray emitting gas ,",
    "the thermal energy content given in table 5 is @xmath102  erg . assuming that this is the result of complete thermalization of the kinetic energy of the stellar - winds and sn ejecta , occurring over the lifetime of the ob associations , then @xmath103 for the whole galaxy is @xmath104  erg  s@xmath2 ( a similar estimate to the @xmath105  erg  s@xmath2 obtained by della ceca et al , 1997 , from the leitherer & heckman , 1995 , starburst models ) .",
    "the actual thermalization will be less than complete , but as argued by strickland & stevens ( 2000 ) , will most likely be between 10 and 100 % , meaning that the @xmath103 value above could be greater by up to an order of magnitude . assuming the initial ism pressure was similar to that of our galaxy",
    "then @xmath106 and comparison to the gas pressures for the hot gas given in table 5 show that they are an order of magnitude higher which is to be expected for an adiabatically expanding over - pressured bubble . as a further assumption",
    ", the hot gas will be at a lower density than the initial ambient density of the ism and an order of magnitude change will be assumed from the average value in table 5 .",
    "the result of using these figures in the above equation with @xmath107 means that the scale - height for ngc  4449 has to be @xmath108  kpc which is somewhat less than the size of the hi halo .",
    "in addition this figure will be an overestimate since @xmath103 was estimated from the energy content of the whole volume assumed to be occupied by the diffuse emission .",
    "the volume of the western superbubble is only @xmath109 of the total volume and if the ambient ism density is assumed to be closer to that of the hot gas then again the scale - height will decrease .",
    "if the halo has holes in it , as suggested by the presence of streamers rather than an homogeneous distribution , then escape is more likely .",
    "if escape occurs then the amount of mass lost may affect ngc  4449 s ability to continue star - formation . assuming the super - bubble has around a tenth of the volume of the diffuse emission and as such around a tenth of the mass given in table 5 then over @xmath110  myr",
    ", the average mass injection rate will have been 0.14  @xmath19  yr@xmath2 , a figure which is similar to that predicted for mrk  33 ( summers et al .",
    "2001 ) , another dwarf galaxy that may be developing a super - wind .",
    "if this rate of mass injection was maintained while the super - bubble / super - wind expanded to the edge of the hi halo over a time - span of @xmath92  myr then the total amount of mass it would contain would be @xmath111  @xmath19 .",
    "this value is greater than the mass contained within the 3 ob associations ( @xmath112  @xmath19 ) and the time - scale is also in excess of the life - times of the massive stars found there , so unless a large amount of mass - loading from ism material is to occur this would be an over - estimate of the mass that the super - bubble / super - wind would contain on escape .",
    "compared to the total mass of ngc  4449 of @xmath18  @xmath19 this is only about @xmath113 of the galaxy s total mass .",
    "as the time - scale required is in excess of the life - times of the massive stars then the energy - injection rate would also decrease before escape was attained , suggesting that the bubble expansion is likely to stall .",
    "hence it seems unlikely that the development of this super - bubble / super - wind in ngc  4449 will have a great deal of effect on the galaxy s ability to both retain its products of star - formation and continue star - formation in the future .",

    "the stars represent the approximate positions of the starclusters in the two densest populated regions , as identified by gelatt et al .",
    "the structure shown in the x - ray emission in the nw super - bubble may be indicative of the bubble rupturing and x - ray emission beginning to extend beyond the h@xmath11 emission as is suggested in the x - ray and h@xmath11 slices of fig .",

    "in summary , we have presented an analysis of the x - ray data obtained from a 30  ks observation , of the magellanic irregular , starburst galaxy ngc  4449 , by the _",
    "chandra _ satellite .",
    "we find x - ray emission from 32 discrete point sources in the s3 chip data with 24 of them lying within the optical extent of the galaxy , as measured by the extent of the @xmath41 ellipse . some of these can be clearly identified as snrs , others as xrbs and there are also several sss .",
    "we calculate an age for the previously identified snr ( source 15 ) of @xmath115  yr and a density for the medium into which it has exploded of being @xmath116  @xmath99 .",
    "the bright sss ( source 14 ) is a candidate for being a white dwarf binary system , while the source exhibiting the highest count rate during the observation ( source 27 ) , shows long term variability and is most likely an hmxb .",
    "the galaxy has a very extended distribution of hi , but the inner concentration of hi has an overall general morphology which also follows that of the x - ray emission but on a larger scale .",
    "the hi complexes within the inner region could be the result of outflows from the multiple star clusters in the starburst of ngc  4449 compressing and driving the ambient ism of the galaxy away from the centre , both along the minor axis of the galaxy and above regions of increased star formation within the disk .",
    "the overall extent of the inner hi concentration is @xmath63  kpc , that of h@xmath11 is @xmath117  kpc and that of the x - ray emission is @xmath118  kpc .",
    ", with this central region being embedded within an huge hi halo extending out to @xmath20  kpc .",
    "the total x - ray luminosity of ngc  4449 in the @xmath38  kev energy band is @xmath119  erg  s@xmath2  @xmath3 . of this",
    ", @xmath120 is due to resolved point sources and the rest is due to diffuse x - ray emission . as suggested by this analysis and those of other starburst galaxies ( e.g. ngc  253 , strickland et al .",

    "1997 ) , the diffuse x - ray emission is emerging as a multi - phase environment requiring complex spectral models which the spectral resolution of even current x - ray telescopes can not meaningfully constrain .",
    "we thus conclude that the diffuse x - ray emission contains gas at , at least two different temperatures and evidence for unresolved point sources .",
    "the fitted gas temperatures are @xmath121  kev and @xmath122  kev for the soft and medium components respectively and their respective absorption corrected fluxes in the @xmath38  kev band are @xmath123  erg  s@xmath2  @xmath3 and @xmath124  erg  s@xmath2  @xmath3 corresponding to luminosities of @xmath125  erg  s@xmath2 and @xmath126  erg  s@xmath2 .",
    "this diffuse emission seems to be more heavily absorbed in the sw of the galaxy and shows a higher temperature in the central and eastern regions consistent with ngc  4449 being an inclined magellanic irregular galaxy , with its minor axis inclined to the n and w of our line - of - sight .",
    "the morphologies of the x - ray and h@xmath11 emissions from the galaxy follow each other closely and the x - ray emission appears to fill cavities in the h@xmath11 emission to the nw and e  highly suggestive of wind - blown super - bubbles extending along the minor axis of the galaxy . to the se and w , the x - ray emission seems to lie outside the h@xmath11 emission and this may indicate the developing of a super - wind from the rupture of the super - bubbles .",
    "the large number of peaks in emission seen in both the h@xmath11 and diffuse x - ray data indicates a complex morphology within the main body of the galaxy .",
    "regions containing small , ( @xmath62  kpc ) , bubbles of x - ray emission surrounded by shells of h@xmath11 emission are seen , that are produced by the combined action of stellar - winds and sn explosions from massive stars , shock - heating both the stellar - ejecta and ism and sweeping it into shells as the ejecta drives its way out of star clusters .",
    "the hot x - ray emitting gas has a total thermal energy content of @xmath127  erg and a total mass of @xmath128  @xmath19 .",
    "the super - bubble / super - wind extending to the wnw of the galaxy occupies around @xmath129 of the total volume occupied by the hot gas ( assuming a filling factor of 1 ) .",
    "the origin of this out - flow appears to be the concentration of star clusters observed in the sw region of the galaxy disk ( hill et al .",
    "1994 ) . at present , the average energy injection rate for the whole galaxy is @xmath104  erg  s@xmath2 and the mass injection rate into the super - bubble is @xmath130  @xmath19  yr@xmath2 .",
    "it seems unlikely that this bubble can escape from the huge hi halo at its current estimated expansion speed of @xmath131  km  s@xmath2 , as the time required is in excess of the life - times of the massive stars of the star clusters and comparable to the radiative cooling time of the soft component of the diffuse emission , whilst the expansion velocity is less than the estimated escape velocity from the hi halo .",
    "however , the current temperatures of both gas components imply that they are capable of escaping the galaxy s gravitational potential and so venting metal - enriched , hot gas into the igm .",
    "the crucial factors are the time for which energy injection can be maintained and the actual distribution of hi in the halo of ngc  4449 . the less homogeneous the distribution , the more likely the possibility that some of the hot gas can escape . at current mass injection rates ,",
    "the total mass loss would be @xmath132 of the galaxy s mass and as such would not have a catastrophic effect on ngc  4449 .",
