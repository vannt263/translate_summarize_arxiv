    "in past years we have witnessed remarkable progress in the study of exclusive charmless @xmath0 decays .",
    "experimentally , cleo @xcite has discovered many new two - body decay modes @xmath1 and found a possible evidence for @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , cleo has provided new improved upper limits for many other decay modes .",
    "while all the measured channels are penguin dominated , the most recently observed @xmath3 mode is dominated by the tree diagram . in the meantime , updates and new results of many",
    "@xmath4 decays with @xmath5 and @xmath6 as well as @xmath7 decays will be available soon . with the @xmath0 factories babar and belle starting to collect data , many exciting and harvest years in the arena of @xmath0 physics and @xmath8 violation",
    "are expected to come .",
    "theoretically , many significant improvements and developments have been achieved over past years .",
    "for example , a next - to - leading order effective hamiltonian for current - current operators and qcd as well as electroweak penguin operators becomes available .",
    "the renormalization scheme and scale problems with the factorization approach for matrix elements can be circumvented by employing scale- and scheme - independent effective wilson coefficients .",
    "heavy - to - light form factors have been computed using qcd sum rules , lattice qcd and potential models .",
    "although the hadronic matrix element @xmath9 can be directly calculated in the lattice framework , it is conventionally evaluated under the factorization hypothesis so that @xmath10 is factorized into the product of two matrix elements of single currents , governed by decay constants and form factors . in spite of its tremendous simplicity ,",
    "the naive factorization approach encounters two principal difficulties .",
    "one of them is that the hadronic matrix element under factorization is renormalization scale @xmath11 independent as the vector or axial - vector current is partially conserved .",
    "consequently , the amplitude @xmath12 is not truly physical as the scale dependence of wilson coefficients does not get compensation from the matrix elements .",
    "a plausible solution to the aforementioned scale problem is to extract the @xmath11 dependence from the matrix element @xmath9 , combine it with the @xmath11-dependent wilson coefficients to form @xmath11-independent effective wilson coefficients .",
    "however , it was pointed out recently in @xcite that @xmath13 suffer from the gauge and infrared ambiguities since an off - shell external quark momentum , which is usually chosen to regulate the infrared divergence occurred in the radiative corrections to the local 4-quark operators , will introduce a gauge dependence .",
    "therefore , this solution , though removes the scale and scheme dependence of a physical amplitude in the framework of the factorization hypothesis , often introduces the infrared cutoff and gauge dependence .",
    "it was recently shown in @xcite that the above - mentioned problems on gauge dependence and infrared singularity associated with the effective wilson coefficients can be resolved by perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) factorization theorem . in this formalism , partons , _",
    "i.e. _ , external quarks , are assumed to be on shell , and both ultraviolet and infrared divergences in radiative corrections are isolated using the dimensional regularization . because external quarks are on shell , gauge invariance of the decay amplitude",
    "is maintained under radiative corrections to all orders .",
    "this statement is confirmed by an explicit one - loop calculation in @xcite .",
    "the obtained ultraviolet poles are subtracted in a renormalization scheme , while the infrared poles are absorbed into universal nonperturbative bound - state wave functions .",
    "the remaining finite piece is grouped into a hard decay subamplitude .",
    "the decay rate is then factorized into the convolution of the hard subamplitude with the bound - state wave functions , both of which are well - defined and gauge invariant .",
    "explicitly , the effective wilson coefficient has the expression @xmath14 where @xmath15 is an evolution factor from the scale @xmath11 to @xmath16 , whose anomalous dimension is the same as that of @xmath17 , and @xmath18 describes the evolution from @xmath16 to @xmath19 ( @xmath19 being a factorization scale arising from the dimensional regularization of infrared divergences ) , whose anomalous dimension differs from that of @xmath17 because of the inclusion of the dynamics associated with spectator quarks . setting @xmath20 , the effective wilson coefficients obtained from the one - loop vertex corrections to the 4-quark operators @xmath21 have the form : [ ceff ] c_i^eff|__f = m_b & = & c_i()+_s4(^(0)t+r^t)_ijc_j()+ , where the matrix @xmath22 gives momentum - independent constant terms which depend on the treatment of @xmath23 .",
    "the expression of @xmath22 for @xmath24 transition current - current operators @xmath25 is given in @xcite , while the complete result for qcd - penguin operators @xmath26 and electroweak penguin operators @xmath27 is given in @xcite .",
    "it should be accentuated that , contrary to the previous work based on landau gauge and off - shell regularization @xcite , the matrix @xmath22 given in eq .",
    "( [ ceff ] ) is gauge invariant .",
    "consequently , the effective wilson coefficients ( [ ceff ] ) are not only scheme and scale independent but also free of gauge and infrared problems .",
    "it is known that the effective wilson coefficients appear in the factorizable decay amplitudes in the combinations @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xmath30 .",
    "phenomenologically , the number of colors @xmath31 is often treated as a free parameter to model the nonfactorizable contribution to hadronic matrix elements and its value can be extracted from the data of two - body nonleptonic decays .",
    "as shown in @xcite , nonfactorizable effects in the decay amplitudes of @xmath32 can be absorbed into the parameters @xmath33 .",
    "this amounts to replacing @xmath31 in @xmath34 by @xmath35 .",
    "explicitly , a_2i^eff = c_2i^eff+1(n_c^eff)_2ic_2i-1^ eff , a_2i-1^eff= c_2i-1^eff+1(n_c^eff)_2i-1c^eff_2i , ( i=1,,5 ) , where @xmath36 with @xmath37 being the nonfactorizable terms which receive main contributions from color - octet current operators @xcite . in the absence of final - state interactions",
    ", we shall assume that @xmath37 and hence @xmath38 are real .",
    "if @xmath37 are universal ( i.e. process independent ) in charm or bottom decays , then we have a generalized factorization scheme in which the decay amplitude is expressed in terms of factorizable contributions multiplied by the universal effective parameters @xmath39 .",
    "phenomenological analyses of the two - body decay data of @xmath40 and @xmath0 mesons indicate that while the generalized factorization hypothesis in general works reasonably well , the effective parameters @xmath41 do show some variation from channel to channel , especially for the weak decays of charmed mesons . a recent updated analysis of @xmath42 data gives @xcite [ a2 ] ( bd)~(1.8 - 2.2),_2(bd)~(0.12 - 0.21 ) .",
    "it is customary to assume in the literature that @xmath43 so that the subscript @xmath44 can be dropped ; that is , the nonfactorizable term is usually postulated to behave in the same way in penguin and tree decay amplitudes .",
    "a closer investigation shows that this is not the case .",
    "it has been argued in @xcite that nonfactorizable effects in the matrix elements of @xmath45 operators are _ a priori _ different from that of @xmath46 operators .",
    "one primary reason is that the fierz transformation of the @xmath45 operators @xmath47 is quite different from that of @xmath46 operators @xmath48 and @xmath49 . as a result ,",
    "contrary to the common assertion , @xmath50 induced by the @xmath45 operators are theoretically different from @xmath51 generated by the @xmath46 operators @xcite .",
    "therefore , we shall assume that & & n_c^eff(ll)(n_c^eff)_1(n_c^eff)_2(n_c^eff)_3(n_c^eff)_4(n_c^eff)_9(n_c^eff)_10 , + & & n_c^eff(lr)(n_c^eff)_5(n_c^eff)_6(n_c^eff)_7(n_c^eff)_8 , and @xmath52 in general .",
    "since the energy release in the energetic two - body charmless @xmath0 decays is not less than that in @xmath53 decays , it is thus expected that @xmath54 and hence @xmath55 . from the data analysis in the next section",
    ", we shall see that @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "we have studied in detail the two - body charmless @xmath0 decays for @xmath58 mesons in @xcite and for @xmath59 mesons in @xcite . in what follows",
    "we show some highlights of the data analysis .",
    "very recently , cleo has made the first observation of a hadronic @xmath60 decay , namely @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "the preliminary measurement yields : ( b^^0^)=(1.50.50.4)10 ^ -5 . the branching ratios of this mode decreases with @xmath51 as it involves interference between external and internal @xmath62-emission amplitudes . from fig .",
    "1 it is clear that this class - iii decay is sensitive to @xmath63 if @xmath51 is treated as a free parameter , namely , @xmath64 ; it has the lowest value of order @xmath65 and then grows with @xmath63 .",
    "we see from fig .  1 that @xmath66 .",
    "since the tree diagrams make the dominant contributions , we then have 1.1(ll)2.6  from  b^^0^. therefore , @xmath51 is favored to be less than 3 , as expected .",
    "there are two additional experimental hints that favor the choice @xmath67 .",
    "first is the class - iii decay @xmath68 .",
    "this mode is very similar to @xmath69 as its decay amplitude differs from that of @xmath70 only in the @xmath71 penguin term which is absent in the former .",
    "since the coefficient @xmath72 is small and it is further subject to the quark - mixing angle suppression , the decay rates of @xmath70 and @xmath69 are very similar .",
    "although experimentally only the upper limit @xmath73 is quoted by cleo @xcite , the cleo measurements @xmath74 and @xmath75 with @xmath76 indicate that the central value of @xmath77 is about @xmath78 .",
    "this means @xmath79 ( see fig .",
    "3 of @xcite ) or @xmath80 is favored ; the prediction for @xmath81 is @xmath82 and @xmath83 in the bauer - stech - wirbel ( bsw ) model @xcite and the light - cone sum rule ( lcsr ) analysis @xcite for heavy - to - light form factors , respectively .",
    "the second hint comes from the decay @xmath84 . a very recent cleo analysis of @xmath84 presents an improved upper limit , @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "it also implies that @xmath51 is preferred to be smaller @xcite .",
    "the decay amplitudes of the penguin - dominated modes @xmath87 and @xmath2 are governed by the effective coefficients @xmath88 $ ] .",
    "note that the qcd penguin coefficients @xmath89 and @xmath90 are sensitive to @xmath51 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "we see from figs .  6 and 7 of @xcite that the decay rates of @xmath91 increase with @xmath92 irrespective of @xmath51 . the new cleo upper limit @xmath93 at 90% c.l .",
    "@xcite implies that [ nclr ] ( lr ) with @xmath51 being fixed at the value of 2 .",
    "note that this constraint is subject to the corrections from spacelike penguin and @xmath62-annihilation contributions . at any rate , it is safe to conclude that @xmath94 .",
    "cleo has seen a @xmath95 evidence for the decay @xmath96 .",
    "its branching ratio , the average of @xmath97 and @xmath98 modes , is reported to be @xcite [ phik * ] b(bk^*)=(1.1^+0.6_-0.50.2)10 ^ -5 . we find that the branching ratio of @xmath96 is in general larger ( less ) than that of @xmath99 in the lcsr ( bsw ) model .",
    "this is because @xmath100 is very sensitive to the form factor ratio @xmath101 , which is equal to 0.875 ( 1.03 ) in the lcsr ( bsw ) model . in particular ,",
    "@xmath102 is predicted by the lcsr for @xmath81 and @xmath103 , which is in accordance with experiment .",
    "it is evident that the data of @xmath99 and @xmath96 can be simultaneously accommodated in the lcsr analysis ( see figs .  6 and 7 of @xcite )",
    "therefore , the non - observation of @xmath99 does not necessarily invalidate the factorization hypothesis ; it could imply that the form - factor ratio @xmath104 is less than unity . of course , it is also possible that the absence of @xmath99 events is a downward fluctuation of the experimental signal . at any rate , in order to clarify this issue and to pin down the effective number of colors @xmath50 , measurements of @xmath99 and @xmath96 are urgently needed with sufficient accuracy .",
    "the published cleo results @xcite on the decay @xmath107 : @xmath108 are several times larger than earlier theoretical predictions @xcite in the range of @xmath109 .",
    "it was pointed out in past two years by several authors @xcite that the decay rate of @xmath107 will get enhanced because of the small running strange quark mass at the scale @xmath16 and sizable @xmath110 breaking in the decay constants @xmath111 and @xmath112 .    as shown in @xcite ,",
    "if @xmath51 is treated to be the same as @xmath50 , the branching ratio of @xmath113 is @xmath114 at @xmath115 and it becomes @xmath116 when the @xmath117 charm content contribution with @xmath118 mev is taken into account .",
    "however , the discrepancy between theory and experiment is greatly improved by treating @xmath51 and @xmath50 differently .",
    "setting @xmath81 , we find that ( see fig .",
    "2 ) the decay rates of @xmath105 are considerably enhanced especially at small @xmath92 .",
    "specifically , @xmath119 at @xmath120 is enhanced from @xmath121 to @xmath122 due to three enhancements .",
    "first , the @xmath117 charm content contribution @xmath123 now always contributes in the right direction to the decay rate irrespective of the value of @xmath50 .",
    "second , the interference in the spectator amplitudes of @xmath124 is constructive .",
    "third , the term proportional to @xmath125 is enhanced when @xmath126 .",
    "therefore , the data of @xmath127 provide a strong support for @xmath67 and the relation @xmath128 . the mode @xmath105 has the largest branching ratio in the two - body charmless @xmath0 decays due mainly to the constructive interference between the penguin contributions arising from the @xmath129 and @xmath130 components of the @xmath117 .",
    "by contrast , the destructive interference for the @xmath131 production leads to a much small decay rate for @xmath132 .",
    "the cleo observation @xcite of a large branching ratio for @xmath133 , @xmath135 , is rather difficult to explain at first sight .",
    "we showed in @xcite that in the absence of fsi , the branching ratio of @xmath136 is expected to be of the same order as @xmath137 , while experimentally it is of order @xmath138 .",
    "we argued that @xmath136 receives a sizable final - state rescattering contribution from the intermediate states @xmath139 which interfere constructively , whereas the analogous rescattering effect on @xmath140 is very suppressed .",
    "however , if the measured branching ratio @xmath141 is similar to @xmath142 , then @xmath62-annihilation and spacelike penguins may play a prominent role .",
    "likewise , the decay mode @xmath143 is expected to be dominated by inelastic rescattering from @xmath144 intermediate states ."
