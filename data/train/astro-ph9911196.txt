    "the study of the ly@xmath0 forest has been making a transition toward unification with other methods of investigating the large - scale structure of the universe .",

    "progress with theoretical modeling of the intergalactic medium occurred at the same time as the first high resolution and signal - to - noise ly@xmath0 forest spectra from the keck telescope s hires instrument @xcite became available , and as the large transverse sizes @xcite and the small - scale smoothness @xcite of the absorbers were discovered , which eliminated many of the alternative models .",
    "as the results of these simulations and the effects of numerical resolution , box size and thermal evolution of the igm are better understood , one can start measuring parameters of the theory of large - scale structure from the observations of the ly@xmath0 forest .",
    "thus , the distribution and the mean of the transmitted flux constrain the density - temperature distribution of the ionized gas , and determine a parameter depending mainly on the baryon density and the intensity of the ionizing background @xcite . the power spectrum of the ly@xmath0 forest",
    "is closely related to the power spectrum of the mass fluctuations , allowing a measurement of the amplitude of these fluctuations at high redshift which gives important constraints for large - scale structure models @xcite .",
    "the doppler parameter distribution of the absorption lines can be used to measure the mean temperature at different densities @xcite , which depends on the ionization history of the igm @xcite .",
    "a lot of these observational results are based on a direct measurement of the statistical properties of the transmitted flux in the ly@xmath0 forest , which is a one - dimensional random field depending on the density , temperature and velocity of the gas at every point along the line of sight .",
    "while a large body of observational data has been published following the more traditional method of fitting the absorption as being due to discrete absorbers with voigt profiles , the work using flux statistics was generally aimed at determining specific cosmological information and less focused on a general presentation of the observational results . in this paper , we present the first detailed tabulation of the probability distribution function , power spectrum , and correlation function of the transmitted flux using the highest quality spectra currently available , and paying special attention to the calculation of error bars .",
    "the primary focus of this paper is on a clear presentation of the observational results , in a form that is useful for comparisons with future cosmological simulations and models , as well as other observations . with this aim , the statistics that we use",

    "in this section we describe the observational data set and the ly@xmath0 forest simulation that we use .",
    "we use a set of eight quasars with spectra that are fully resolved and have high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "seven of our quasars ( q2343 + 123 , q1442 + 293 , q1107 + 485 , q1425 + 604 , q1422 + 230 , q0000 - 262 , and q2237 - 061 ) are the same as in @xcite , but we add kp 77 : 1623 + 2653 , one of the triplet of quasars described in @xcite .",
    "the pixel noise is typically less than 5% of the continuum flux level , and frequently as low as 1% .",
    "the velocity resolution is 6.6 @xmath18 ( fwhm ) and the spectra are binned in 0.04    pixels .",
    "continua were fitted to the hires spectra using the iraf continuum task .",
    "spline3 or chebycheff polynomials were used .",
    "the order of the polynomials and the number of fitting regions strongly depended on the signal - to - noise in the spectra and the redshift . as a rule of thumb ,",
    "the higher the s / n ratio and the weaker the absorption , the more fitting regions were used and the higher the order of a polynomial was taken ( amounting to several tens of degrees of freedom for a typical case of s / n@xmath19 30 , @xmath20 ly@xmath0 forest spectrum ) .",
    "the regions between ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath21 were cut into 2 to 4 pieces for fitting , which were re - joined after fitting to form a long spectrum .",
    "the continua were fitted to regions of the lyman @xmath0 forest deemed free of absorption lines ( as judged by eye ) .",
    "at best this is a problematic definition , as the perception of a stretch of spectrum as being free of absorption depends on the signal - to - noise ratio of the data , the average line density ( and thus the redshift ) , the mean background absorption ( i.e. , the possibility of a constant absorption trough on top of individual absorption lines ) , and the spectral resolution .",
    "the last point does not pose a problem for the current data as absorption features with widths down to 6.6 kms@xmath22 are resolved , and typical lyman @xmath0 line widths are much larger than that ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the possibility of unrecognized large - scale absorption features in the absorption is a more serious concern .",
    "determining the position and extent of line - free spectral regions by eye tends to mistake large shallow flux depressions as parts of the unabsorbed continuum , so the continuum would be systematically placed low , leading to an underestimate of the absorbed optical depth .",
    "similar problems arise for the high redshift ( z@xmath23 4 ) ly@xmath0 forest where more than half of the flux is absorbed and the spectrum between the absorption lines rarely recovers enough to reach the probable continuum level of the qso .",
    "in such cases only a stiff polynomial ( typically with 3 to 5 degrees of freedom for the region from ly@xmath0 to ly@xmath21 ) can be used .",
    "this lack of information caused by the sparsely sampled continuum can lead to local uncertainties in the continuum exceeding 5% , as can be shown by comparison with more easily flux - normalizeable , low resolution single order spectra of the same qso .",
    "the s / n ratio , finally , may also lead to biases , in that , at higher redshifts , the apparently unabsorbed continuum portions between the absorption lines shrink in size and noise . as the final selection of fitting regions",
    "is done by eye , the shortness of the continuum portions could easily eliminate true continuum regions or introduce spurious ones in the sample of supposed continuum data points .",
    "this last effect does not produce global errors in the continuum level , but it can introduce local fluctuations .    these uncertainties in the continuum",
    "fitting can affect the results reported in this paper on the flux distribution function , the power spectrum and the correlation function , and should be considered as a source of possible systematic errors in addition to quoted statistical errors of the results .",
    "this underscores the need to obtain spectra in the future with a good flux calibration , so that the continuum can be fitted with many fewer free parameters under the assumption of a smooth underlying continuum spectrum of the observed quasar @xcite .",
    "figure [ quasars ] shows the redshift range covered by the useful part of each spectrum .",
    "the wavelength regions of the spectra of these eight quasars that were included in the present analysis were selected as follows : first , only the regions between the ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath21 emission wavelengths were included , excluding also an interval within 5 @xmath24 mpc of the quasar to avoid the proximity effect .",
    "approximately half of the kp 77 spectrum has signal - to - noise ratio lower than any of the @xcite data so this region was eliminated .",
    "finally , damped ly@xmath0 absorption lines and narrow lines known or suspected to be metal lines were removed , by eliminating small intervals of the spectra containing these absorption lines from the spectra .",
    "the detailed list of wavelength intervals eliminated in each quasar is available on the website mentioned above .",
    "the data preparation is described in more detail in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we present in this paper the results on the flux distribution function ( in greater detail than in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as the power spectrum and correlation function of the transmitted flux .",
    "all the observational results are given with error bars obtained using the bootstrap method @xcite , including the full covariance matrices for all the results except the power spectrum .",
    "the bootstrap procedure consists of dividing the data into @xmath25 segments and generating modified realizations of a statistic by randomly selecting @xmath25 of the segments ( with replacement ) .",
    "the dispersion in the bootstrap realizations approximates the error on the observed statistic .",
    "the method for computing the error bars is described in detail in appendix b. we present only the diagonal elements of the error matrices in the tables here .",
    "the full covariance matrices can be obtained from the website mentioned above .",
    "our intention is to allow detailed comparisons of these results with cosmological simulations and with other observational results .",
    "we compare the observations to the output of the eulerian hydrodynamical simulation described in @xcite ( referred to as l10 in that paper ) .",
    "the cosmological model used is @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and a large - scale primordial power spectrum slope @xmath30 .",
    "this model is in agreement with the large set of observations of large - scale structure currently available ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the box size of the simulation is @xmath31 mpc , and it contains @xmath32 cells .",
    "ly@xmath0 spectra are computed for a large number of lines of sight along the box axes .",
    "there is one free parameter that we can vary when computing the spectra , the normalization of the optical depth , which we adjust to reproduce the observed transmitted flux , as we show in  3 .",
    "renormalizing the optical depth is equivalent to modifying the intensity of the ionizing background , as long as the effect of collisional ionization and the change in the gas temperature caused by the different heating rate can be neglected ( see * ? ? ? * for a test that these effects are in fact negligible ; notice that collisional ionization is actually important in high temperature gas in the simulations , but this gas is always at high density and produces saturated absorption in ly@xmath0 ) . the optical depth",
    "is then mapped to transmitted flux using @xmath33 .",
    "these theoretical spectra are then modified to account for the continuum fitting , resolution and noise in the observations .",
    "of these three effects , the most difficult to reproduce is the operation of continuum fitting , where several points along the spectrum of the quasars that appear not to have any obvious absorption are selected to indicate the quasar continuum .",
    "this operation is inevitable if the intrinsic spectrum of the quasar is unknown .",
    "unfortunately , there is not really a good way to correct for it because the spectra obtained from simulations obviously have the period of the simulated box , which is comparable to the typical distance between successive continuum fitting points .",
    "following @xcite , we estimate the effects of continuum fitting by defining the maximum transmitted flux along any line of sight in the simulation ( parallel to one of the three axes ) to be the continuum flux , @xmath34 , and dividing the flux in all other pixels by @xmath34 .",
    "we convolve with the instrumental resolution of @xmath35 , and we add gaussian noise to each cell with the dispersion @xmath36 , which is given below in table [ pdftab ] .",
    "the dispersion @xmath36 is computed as the mean noise in all pixels in the observed spectra for every flux bin .",
    "notice that the noise increases with the flux value because there is a constant background noise plus the poisson noise of the photon counts in each pixel .",
    "we also map the 288 cells along an axis in the simulation onto 512 pixels in the spectra , to facilitate the computation of fourier transforms .",
    "the noise in table [ pdftab ] is for the pixel width in the observational data , @xmath37  .",
    "when we compute the power spectrum and correlation function this noise level is multiplied by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the wavelength extent of the pixels in the simulated spectra .    in @xcite , an additional correction to the observed",
    "spectra was applied to correct for the redshift evolution within a redshift bin before a comparison is made with a simulation at a given redshift @xmath40 .",
    "this consisted of multiplying the optical depth in pixels within a redshift bin around @xmath40 by the factor @xmath41^{4.5}$ ] , so that all the observed pixels are corrected to a redshift @xmath40 according to a law that approximately fits the observed evolution .",
    "we do not apply this correction here .",
    "the correction is small for the redshift bins we shall use ; nevertheless , it must be born in mind that our observational results for the flux distribution and power spectrum are averages over each of our redshift bins .",
    "the reason we do not include this correction is that it changes the statistical distribution of the pixel noise in a way that biases some of the results .",
    "not including the correction also makes it easier to compare to any simulation in an accurate way : after the continuum fitting , resolution and noise are included in simulated spectra , one can average the quantity being compared over the same redshift bins used here .",
    "in this section we present results for the mean and variance of the transmitted flux , with error bars calculated using the resampling method described in appendix b. we then revisit the value of @xmath42 derived in @xcite .",
    "the mean transmitted flux @xmath43 is computed by averaging over all the pixels in a certain data subset ( either a given quasar or a redshift bin ) .",
    "figure [ meanfs ] shows the mean transmitted flux with error bars for each quasar .",
    "figure [ sigsqs ] shows the variance of the flux for each quasar , @xmath44 .",
    "the variance contributed by the pixel noise , @xmath45 , is generally negligible .",
    "the pixel noise does not significantly affect the error bars on the mean and variance of the transmitted flux , which are dominated by the fluctuations in the number of absorbers in the spectra .",
    "we notice that the increase of @xmath46 with redshift is due to the increasing mean flux decrement ( the true density fluctuations are of course decreasing with redshift due to gravitational clustering evolution ) .",

    "in addition to the amplitude of the power spectrum , the simulation outputs at different redshifts also differ on the distribution of temperatures .",
    "the mean temperature at overdensity of unity is given in the last column of table [ tautable ] ) .",
    "the differences in the derived @xmath62 for different simulation outputs in table [ tautable ] are due to both the different temperatures and the declining fluctuation amplitude with redshift .",
    "the values of @xmath62 we find are very similar to those in @xcite ; the slight differences we find when comparing to the same simulation output are due to the inclusion of a new quasar in our sample , the different choice of redshift intervals , and differences in the method of analysis ( such as not including the redshift correction to the center of each redshift bin ) .",
    "we give also in table [ tautable ] the statistical error bars due to the sample variance .",
    "in addition , we show the value of @xmath85 when @xmath86 , and the value of @xmath87 when @xmath88 , fixing @xmath89 to the model @xmath28 , @xmath26 , @xmath90 .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to the @xmath62 parameter , how should the predicted mean transmitted flux depend on the specific large - scale structure model that is assumed ? as we shall discuss later in  [ discussion ] , the dominant dependence should be on the gas temperature - density relation , and the density fluctuation amplitude at the jeans scale .",
    "rescaling the gas temperature @xmath92 at a fixed overdensity will result in a variation @xmath93 for a fixed mean transmitted flux , owing to the variation of the recombination coefficient with temperature .",
    "changing the temperature will also change the distribution of absorption , for a fixed real space distribution of gas , by altering the thermal broadening .",
    "in general , increasing the thermal broadening will increase the amount of absorption and so decrease @xmath62 for a fixed mean flux decrement . the full dependence on the gas temperature ( which is affected by radiative cooling , shock heating , etc . )",
    "is more complicated ; however , these two effects incorporate most of the temperature dependence .",
    "the fluctuation amplitude at the jeans scale in the simulation we use is probably close to the correct value in our universe given the good agreement we find later (  4 and 5 ) in the transmitted flux distribution function and the power spectrum .",
    "this limits the model uncertainty in the value of @xmath62 derived from the simulation we use .",
    "however , the dependence on the density distribution is strong because the density of neutral gas is proportional to the square of the baryon density .",
    "the different values of @xmath62 derived from different redshift outputs give an idea of the importance of the model dependence on the gas temperature and the power spectrum amplitude . a more detailed analysis using simulations where these parameters are varied",

    "we believe that even the small disagreement between the simulation and observations at @xmath57 ( figure [ pdf3](a ) ) is due primarily to the imperfection of our continuum fitting approximation . since the inclusion of the continuum fitting correction moves the predicted pdf in the direction of the observed one , as seen in figure [ pdf3 ] , it is plausible that the small remaining discrepancy is due to an underestimate of this correction .",
    "we have examined other possible reasons for this discrepancy , and they were all found to be not significant .",
    "one of these is that the noise that we include in the simulations ( assumed to have a gaussian distribution for a given flux @xmath159 , obtained from the average of the variance of all pixels with flux @xmath159 in table [ pdftab ] ) does not adequately represent the true distribution function of the noise , which is actually a sum of gaussians with the variance distribution of all the pixels with flux @xmath159 in the observations .",
    "we tested this by computing the predicted @xmath157 given the actual distribution of noise , and found that the difference it makes is much smaller than the differences between prediction and observation at @xmath57 .",
    "thus , the average noise values we give in table [ pdftab ] should be sufficient to compare results of any other numerical simulations with the observational data presented here on @xmath157 .",
    "another effect is that observational results are obtained by averaging over a certain redshift interval , whereas the simulation predictions are for a fixed redshift .",

    "why is there such a good agreement between the predicted @xmath157 and the observed one , after having adjusted only one parameter ( the mean transmitted flux ) ? to understand the significance of this result , it is useful to think of the optical depth on a given pixel as being determined mostly by the gas density and temperature at a given point in space , @xmath176 ( from photoionization equilibrium ) . given a @xmath177 relation determined by the photoionization history @xcite , the predicted @xmath157 should essentially be a result of gravitational evolution starting from gaussian initial conditions , and it should mostly depend on one parameter only ( in addition to the mean transmitted flux ) : the amplitude of fluctuations on the jeans scale . obviously , the higher the amplitude of density fluctuations , the larger the dispersion in the transmitted flux should be . a weaker dependence on the @xmath177 relation can also be expected .",
    "this suggests two possible implications of the good agreement of the prediction of @xmath157 with the observations , which will need to be examined further : ( a ) the ly@xmath0 forest is indeed a result of gravitational evolution in a photoionized igm starting from gaussian initial conditions ; ( b ) the amplitude of fluctuations in the @xmath4cdm model assumed in the simulation is close to the true value in the universe .    in the next section",

    "figure [ xi3 ] also shows that we can approximately recover the correlation function that is measured from the simulation by summing over the analytic power spectrum using only @xmath10 values of discrete modes that are actually included in the simulation box .",
    "we have presented an observational determination of the pdf , the power spectrum , and the correlation function of the transmitted flux in the ly@xmath0 forest , using a sample of eight quasars over the redshift range @xmath469 .",
    "all our results are given with error bars that include the variance of our sample of eight quasars .",

    "any future observational determinations of the same quantities from other data sets will also be easily comparable .    in our opinion",
    ", there are two main objectives in the accurate measurement of the statistics of the one - dimensional random field of the transmitted flux in the ly@xmath0 forest .",
    "the first is to test the idea that the ly@xmath0 forest is entirely explained by an igm that is photoionized and heated by the known sources of ionizing radiation ( agns and galaxies ) , which evolves gravitationally as described by a large - scale structure theory based on the presence of cold dark matter and adiabatic , gaussian primordial fluctuations .",
    "the second objective is to measure some of the parameters of the large - scale structure model from the ly@xmath0 forest observations .    even though there are a large number of parameters required to fully describe the cosmological and large - scale structure model , and the population of sources of ionizing radiation , only certain combinations of these parameters are important to determine the observable properties of the ly@xmath0 forest to a first approximation .",
    "a simple intuitive understanding of what these parameters are can be developed by considering a simplified model where the power spectrum of fluctuations is approximated as a power - law , and the igm follows a simple density - temperature relation @xmath470 . in this case , the temperature @xmath92 determines a jeans scale , and all the statistical properties of the ly@xmath0 optical depth should depend only on the amplitude of the density fluctuations at the jeans scale , @xmath471 , the effective power - law index near the jeans scale @xmath472 , and @xmath391 ( it is understood here that all these parameters depend on redshift for any given model ) .",
    "in addition , varying the temperature @xmath92 ( while keeping @xmath471 , @xmath472 and @xmath391 fixed ) should cause a rescaling of all the statistical properties of the ly@xmath0 forest in velocity ( proportional to the jeans scale , or @xmath473 ) , and varying the parameter @xmath62 ( defined in eq .  [ mudef ] ) should cause a rescaling of the optical depth .",
    "therefore , in this simplified model the ly@xmath0 forest depends on five parameters only , and the changes under two of them are trivially obtained by rescalings .",
    "only @xmath471 and @xmath472 contain information on the large - scale structure model ; @xmath92 and @xmath391 depend on how the igm was reionized ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as the power spectrum ( through the effects of shock - heating ) , and @xmath62 depends on @xmath42 , @xmath89 , and the intensity of the ionizing background .    more exact predictions for the ly@xmath0 forest obtained in hydrodynamic simulations will depend on more parameters , due to effects that are neglected in the simplified model just discussed .",
    "the true distribution of density and temperature of the gas has of course a scatter around a mean relationship ; this mean relationship also deviates from a power - law .",
    "this distribution depends on the ratio of the cooling rate to the hubble rate , which is proportional to the new parameter @xmath474 .",
    "in addition , the effects of cooling imply that changing @xmath92 will no longer result in a simple rescaling in velocity of all statistical properties of the ly@xmath0 forest , since the cooling rate has a complex dependence on temperature that breaks the self - similar scaling .",
    "these effects should be important only at high densities , where cooling is important ; at low densities , the thermal evolution of the igm naturally produces the `` hui - gnedin relation '' @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath475 can also change the properties of the density field under gravitational evolution , but this effect should be small because @xmath475 is very close to unity at high redshift .",
    "the evolution of @xmath92 with redshift , and the baryon fraction ( @xmath476 ) can also affect the jeans scale and the gravitational evolution of the photoionized gas @xcite .",
    "these other parameters are likely to cause only small changes in observable properties compared to the five main parameters given above .",
    "we have presented here measurements of some of the principal parameters determining the statistical properties of the ly@xmath0 forest .",
    "the mean transmitted flux determines the parameter @xmath62 , and the flux power spectrum can yield the amplitude and the effective slope of the initial mass power spectrum .",
    "we have carefully computed the error bars due to sample variance for all our results , which are generally consistent with previous ones , although the amplitude of the power spectrum is found to be slightly lower than in @xcite .",
    "both the flux pdf and the power spectrum predicted in the numerical simulations in @xcite agree extremely well with what is observed .",
    "the main limitation we have for the accuracy of this comparison are the uncertainties introduced by the continuum fitting of the flux , and by the presence of narrow metal lines .    our results for the measurement of the initial mass density perturbations are given in terms of the amplitude and power law index ( i.e. , the slope on a plot of @xmath477 vs. @xmath6 ) of the linearly extrapolated primordial power spectrum at @xmath292 at @xmath9 .",
    "the amplitude is @xmath374=0.72\\pm 0.09 $ ] where @xmath375 is the contribution to the mass density variance per unit interval in @xmath6 .",
    "the slope is @xmath11 .",
    "this amplitude result , with its small error bar , must be thought of as partially preliminary .",
    "further study is needed to carefully quantify the effects on the @xmath385 relation of changing the temperature - density relation or details of the simulations .",
    "@xcite found no important systematic errors but this was in the context of larger statistical error bars , and their set of simulations was not exhaustive .",
    "if it proves to be robust , the power spectrum result can strongly constrain potential cosmological and galaxy formation models .",
    "for example , @xcite found that , in order to produce the high velocities observed in studies of the kinematics of damped ly@xmath0 systems @xcite , a model must obey @xmath478 ( 95% confidence ) , where @xmath479 is the linear theory rms fluctuations on spheres of radius @xmath480 at @xmath302 .",
    "the ly@xmath0 forest power spectrum amplitude we have derived in this paper implies @xmath481 , inconsistent with the above upper limit derived from damped ly@xmath0 systems at the @xmath482 level .",
    "this discrepancy , if confirmed in the future , might simply be due to a different relation between the observed velocity dispersions in damped ly@xmath0 systems and the velocity dispersions of their host dark matter halos from the one that was calculated in the spherical equilibrium models in @xcite , but it should in any case provide a new constraint to understand the dynamics of damped ly@xmath0 systems .",
    "we will also present additional results on the measurement of the parameters @xmath92 and @xmath391 in work that is now in preparation ( p. mcdonald et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "these parameters can be determined from the shape of the power spectrum at small scales , or by fitting absorption features to voigt profiles and comparing the distribution of doppler widths to what is obtained in simulations @xcite .",
    "apart from measuring these parameters , one should also strive to find tests for the validity of the general framework of the gravitational evolution theory in cdm models of the ly@xmath0 forest .",
    "various perturbations from this ideal theory should be present at some level .",
    "reionization smoothes the gas fluctuations at scales smaller than the jeans scale for photoionized gas , but dense structures near the jeans scale will not be ionized , heated and destroyed for a long time @xcite .",
    "for example , a virialized halo with velocity dispersion @xmath483 should not accrete much gas when forming after reionization ( since the gas has too much initial entropy and is not able to cool ) , but having formed before reionization it may keep its gas in thermal and hydrodynamic equilibrium , as in the minihalo model @xcite .",
    "these objects might introduce subtle changes in the ly@xmath0 forest that would depend on when and how the igm was reionized . at the same time , when he ii is reionized , the rapid heating of the igm can be inhomogeneous on large scales , resulting in new fluctuations in the ly@xmath0 forest due to the gas temperature that depend on the luminosity function and spatial distribution of the ionizing sources @xcite .",
    "outflows from agns , radio sources and starbursts may also perturb the igm at some level .",
    "finally , the large - scale structure theory itself may be modified ( for example , by having non - gaussian primordial fluctuations ) . a continued effort in comparing the observed spectra with detailed numerical simulations , using a diversity of statistical probes and methods , is required to search for the influence of these phenomena .",
    "we thank david weinberg for his useful comments on an early draft of this paper .",
    "to check various aspects of our data analysis procedure it is useful to have a method for creating mock spectra with properties similar to the observed ones .",
    "for example , we test our code for computing power spectra from the observations by using it to compute the known @xmath179 of the mock spectra .",
    "we also test our method for generating error bars by comparing the bootstrap errors estimated from single random spectra to the ideal results obtained by generating large numbers of independent random spectra ( see below ) .",

    "fit an analytic function to the observed @xmath179 .",
    "generate a gaussian random realization of the fitted @xmath179 on a large , fine grid .",
    "map the values from the grid points onto the observed pixel coordinates @xmath484 .",
    "+ 4 . add noise to each pixel with amplitude given by the mean of the observations .",
    "+   + in step 1 we fit the observed @xmath179 using equation ( [ pspecformula3d ] ) multiplied by a 3d gaussian smoothing function instead of the 1d smoothing function we generally use .",
    "we use this function because it provides a good qualitative fit to the observed @xmath179 over close to the full range of @xmath10 .",
    "we are not concerned with obtaining the best possible fit because we only want to generate mock spectra with a precisely _ known _ input power spectrum that will have properties similar to the observed one . in step 2",
    "we generate a gaussian random field with fourier mode amplitudes given by @xmath485 where @xmath179 is given by the fitting formula from step 1 .",
    "the grid used is evenly spaced in velocity and is always longer than the observed spectrum by a factor of at least 8 with resolution better by a factor of at least 4 . in step 3",
    "we superimpose the uneven set of observed pixel locations on top of the grid generated in step 2 ( using a random origin ) .",
    "the value of @xmath181 assigned to each @xmath484 is linearly interpolated from the two adjacent values on the fine grid .",
    "the spectra generated by this procedure do not have identical statistics to the observations because the observations are not gaussian but this should not be important for our purposes .",
    "although the random fields that we generate have the same power spectrum as the observed spectra , they have a gaussian pdf which is not limited to the range @xmath486 . it should be possible to create more realistic spectra by generating a gaussian ( or even non - gaussian ) field for the optical depth or the baryon density instead of the transmitted flux ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we have adopted the very simple method of generating a gaussian field and calling it the transmitted flux because this allows us to use directly the power spectrum measured from the observed transmitted flux .",
    "it is well known that gravitational collapse leads to non - gaussianity of the density field in the non - linear regime probed by the smallest scales in the ly@xmath0 forest .",
    "it is generally difficult to estimate error bars on measurements when we can not assume that the underlying process is gaussian . to solve this problem",
    "we compute error bars for all of the numbers measured in this paper using a variation of the bootstrap method @xcite .",
    "if we have @xmath25 independent data segments , a bootstrap realization of a computed statistic is created by randomly drawing @xmath25 segments from the set with replacement and recomputing the statistic from the randomly modified set of data .",
    "the bootstrap error bar on a statistic is simply the dispersion among the bootstrap realizations of the statistic .",
    "ideally we would like to divide the data sample into numerous independent parts with identical statistical properties as we could if we had a large number of quasars all at the same redshift for example .",
    "unfortunately we only have 8 quasars and no more than 5 in a single redshift bin .",
    "one would think that because the spectra are long relative to the correlation length they can be split into some number of approximately independent chunks and the bootstrap method applied to those chunks .",
    "the question then is how large must these chunks be relative to the correlation length ?",
    "we can analytically investigate the applicability of the bootstrap method for the situation at hand in the special case where we assume the field _ is _ gaussian .",
    "the bootstrap method does not depend on the field being gaussian so we can hope that if it works in the gaussian case it will work similarly well on observational data with the same power spectrum .",
    "we now investigate analytically the requirements for obtaining reliable bootstrap errors in the case where we are segmenting correlated data .",
    "we represent an abstract set of data by @xmath487 where @xmath488 runs over all @xmath25 pixels . to make analytic calculations possible",
    "we assume @xmath489 is a gaussian random field with @xmath490 , @xmath491 , and @xmath492 .",
    "we want to imagine the situation where the data has been split into @xmath493 segments each containing @xmath494 pixels . if @xmath495 is some statistic that can be measured from the data ( like the mean ) , we define @xmath496 to be the value of @xmath495 that is actually computed from a given set of data , and @xmath497 to be the value of @xmath495 computed from a bootstrap realization of the same data used to compute @xmath496 . taking the variance as an example we have @xmath498 and @xmath499 where @xmath500 is the number of times that data segment @xmath501",
    "was drawn in forming the bootstrap realization .",
    "the occupation numbers @xmath502 have the following property @xmath503 where @xmath504 represents an average over different bootstrap realizations of the same data , @xmath505 is the number of segments drawn from , and @xmath506 for @xmath507 and @xmath508 for @xmath509 .",
    "we will generally use the large @xmath510 approximation @xmath511    to demonstrate the application of this formalism we will compute the bootstrap error on @xmath512 . to make the algebra more transparent",
    "we will further simplify the calculation by making the assumption that the pixels are uncorrelated and the segment length is only one pixel : @xmath513 evaluating the expectation value over bootstrap realizations gives @xmath514 in this simplified case it is easy to find the true error on @xmath515 from the assumption that the field is gaussian .",
    "the result is @xmath516 to relate this to the bootstrap error we must take the expectation value of equation ( [ sigmabs ] ) over different realizations of the underlying gaussian distribution to obtain @xmath517 where we have completed all of the sums using @xmath518 and dropped terms of higher order in @xmath519 .",
    "we see that the correct result is obtained in the large @xmath25 limit .",
    "the error on the correlation function is more complicated and we will not assume uncorrelated pixels or one - pixel segments .",
    "the exact result for a gaussian field in the limit that the data set is much longer than the correlation length is @xmath520 where we have also assumed that @xmath272 and @xmath521 are much smaller than the length of the data set . a bootstrap realization of @xmath465 is given by @xmath522 after evaluating the bootstrap average we find @xmath523 if we make the assumption that the data set is long enough that it can be split into many segments with each segment much longer than the correlation length the calculation of the bootstrap errors averaged over realizations of the gaussian field gives the correct result : @xmath524 the assumptions we were forced to make so that the bootstrap error came out correct seem to be the ones that would be expected intuitively : the data set must be split into a large number of segments and those segments must be larger than the correlation length of the data .",
    "note that cross correlations for widely separated @xmath272 and @xmath521 will not be accurately reproduced but only if they are so widely separated that the cross correlation is in fact very small .",
    "we have really only shown that the bootstrap method can be made to work in the infinite data limit .    to investigate the effectiveness of the bootstrap method applied to real data we turn to the mock spectra described in appendix a.",
    "we generate a set of 50 of each quasar spectrum and apply the data analysis procedure to them exactly as we have done with the observational data .",
    "we find that the optimal number of segments for our redshift bins seems to be about 300 giving segments approximately 100 pixels long .",
    "the errors on @xmath46 , the pdf , and @xmath467 are underestimated by 5 - 15% for the three redshift bins using this size segments .",
    "the error estimated for the mean transmitted flux seems to be more strongly affected by the long range correlations ( underestimated by a factor of 1.6 in the worst case ) , probably because it is only first order in @xmath465 instead of second order like we see in equation ( [ xierror ] ) .    to correct for the these underestimations",
    "we find the ratio of the true error to the bootstrap error in the mock spectra for every statistic we measure and then multiply the bootstrap error on the observational measurement by this factor . in the case of the pdf and correlation function",
    "we have a full error matrix including the correlations between errors on different bins .",
    "we judge the underestimation of the errors by looking at @xmath165 tests comparing the pdf or @xmath465 for all possible of pairs of mock data sets .",
    "the mean value of @xmath321 for @xmath322 degrees of freedom should be 1 and the full distribution of @xmath165 can be computed easily .",
    "we find that the mean @xmath165 computed using the bootstrap errors is no more than 20% higher than expected and we rescale the error matrix of the observational data by this overall factor instead of trying to correct the individual matrix elements . with this rescaling",
    "the distribution of @xmath165 becomes essentially perfect .",
    "note that we do not in any way compute the observational errors from the gaussian mock spectra since we use them only to find edge effect corrections that are then applied to the bootstrap errors calculated from the observational data .",
    "although it plays a large part in the paper , in this discussion we have left out any mention of the power spectrum .",
    "we have not found a fully satisfactory method for computing a full error matrix for @xmath179 using the bootstrap method .",
    "we do not get correct results using the type of analytic calculations we did for the correlation function .",
    "this is probably because we need to treat the edge effects from the finite data set more carefully in the case of the power spectrum .",
    "the obvious technical problem with simply applying the method to the data anyway is that we can not make the segments very small and still measure the power spectrum from them .",
    "we need to keep the segments a few times larger than the longest wavelength for which we want to measure @xmath16 but this restricts the number of them for our data set to about 10 .",
    "we have tried computing full error matrices for our mock spectra using only 10 segments but the results are discouraging .",
    "the distribution of @xmath165 computed from these matrices is not close to what is expected .",
    "this is because the statistical error in estimating all of the error matrix elements from only ten segments is too high .",
    "note that in our mock spectra there are _ no _ correlations between the @xmath179 bins so any that we find in the bootstrap realizations are simply noise . visually comparing the error matrices from the mock spectra and the real data we find that they look very similar .",
    "there is no obvious evidence that the errors in the real data are more correlated than the theoretically uncorrelated mock data ( both become strongly correlated at very high @xmath10 where the window function becomes important ) .",
    "we will simply use the diagonal elements of the bootstrap error matrix and treat the bin errors as independent .",
    "we correct the errors on each bin separately by comparing the true and bootstrap errors in the mock spectra .",
    "these corrections are only significant ( @xmath525% ) on the longest wavelength modes .",
    "note that using independent bootstrap errors on each bin still takes into account the correlation between the individual @xmath10 modes that are averaged to give the bin value .",
    "the measurement of the amplitude shows that at the redshifts in question the modes with @xmath526 should not be fully non - linear supporting the supposition that the correlations between bins is not large .",
    "this appendix shows that the flux power spectrum in the ly@xmath0 forest must indeed be proportional to the mass power spectrum in the limit of large scales , as was first assumed by citetcwk98 .",
    "we shall first consider the simple case where the effect of peculiar velocities is neglected .",
    "let @xmath527 be the flux probability distribution , and @xmath528 be the conditional distribution of @xmath159 given that the overdensity smoothed over a certain scale @xmath529 around the point where the flux @xmath159 is observed is @xmath530 .",
    "we consider the correlation of the transmitted flux at two points , @xmath531 and @xmath532 , separated by a distance much larger than @xmath529 , but where @xmath529 is still a sufficiently large scale for linear theory to be valid . in this case",
    ", the correlation of @xmath531 and @xmath532 should be exclusively due to the correlation of @xmath533 and @xmath534 , the smoothed densities around the points 1 and 2 .",
    "in other words , the joint probability distribution @xmath535 should be equal to the product @xmath536 ( notice that the correlation of the whole deformation tensor at the two points should enter here at the same order as the density correlation ; we are assuming that the constrained probability distribution of the flux depends mostly on the overdensity , and not the other components of the deformation tensor ) . since @xmath537 , we can write @xmath538 , where @xmath539_{\\bar\\delta=0}$ ] . the flux correlation function",
    "is then given by :    @xmath540 \\ , \\left [ p_0(f_2 ) + \\bar\\delta_2 p_{\\delta}(f_2 ) \\right ] ~ f_1\\ , f_2 >   \\nonumber \\\\   & = &   < \\bar\\delta_1 \\bar\\delta_2 > \\int df_1\\ , df_2 \\",
    ", p_{\\delta}(f_1 ) p_{\\delta}(f_2 ) ~ f_1\\ , f_2 \\nonumber \\\\   & = &    \\xi(x_{12 } ) \\ , \\cdot \\ , \\left [ \\int df\\ , p_{\\delta}(f)\\ , f \\right]^2    \\nonumber \\\\   & = & \\xi(x_{12 } ) \\ , \\cdot \\ , \\left ( { d\\bar f \\over d\\bar\\delta } \\right)^2 ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "when peculiar velocities are included , there should be an additional dependence of @xmath157 on the peculiar velocity gradient along the line of sight , @xmath544 ( where @xmath545 is the derivative along the line of sight ) , averaged over the same scale @xmath529 .",
    "we can linearize as before @xmath546 , and define the factor @xmath547 the quantity @xmath548 is a different `` bias factor '' for the ly@xmath0 forest , this one intended for peculiar velocity calculations . defining the new variable @xmath549",
    ", we obtain @xmath550 where @xmath551 is the redshift space correlation function along the line of sight of @xmath552 , which has bias factor @xmath548 .",
    "thus , we see that both @xmath548 and @xmath553 are functions of the flux distribution @xmath527 , and of how this distribution varies with the overdensity and the peculiar velocity gradient smoothed over a large scale around the point where the flux is being measured .",
    "this implies a complex dependence of @xmath548 and @xmath387 on all the variables determining the ly@xmath0 forest properties , such as the fluctuation amplitude on the jeans scale , the mean transmitted flux , and the temperature - density relation .",
