    "a large number of organic and inorganic solids have crystalline structures in which fundamental structural units form linear chains.@xcite in these materials , largely different overlaps of the electronic wave functions in various crystallographic directions lead to strongly anisotropic , so - called quasi - one - dimensional ( quasi-1d ) electron bands . among the exotic physical phenomena in quasi-1d materials , charge density waves ( cdws )",
    "are of much continual interest .",
    "research into this topic has been stimulated by recent advances in experimental techniques , which now allow direct observation of cdws and measurement of various static and dynamic properties of cdw systems.@xcite in general the material of quasi-1d structure is expected to exist in the form of a bundle of chains rather than of a single chain .",
    "in such a bundle of chains , inter - chain tunneling of electrons leads to coupling of the fluctuations on neighboring chains , which may affect the behavior of the system in a crucial way .",

    "the phase transition in the resulting three - dimensional ( 3d ) _ xy _ model under the appropriate symmetry - breaking field is examined via the @xmath0-expansion and the monte carlo method .",
    "it is found that there emerges in the system the clock ordered phase ( with the z@xmath1 symmetry broken ) via a second - order transition , the nature of which depends on the commensurability factor @xmath2 : in particular the critical behavior for @xmath4 appears to be the same as that of the 3d _ xy _ model .",
    "for the four - dimensional ( 4d ) _ xy _ model , on the other hand , mean - field theory is expected to be accurate and reveals a single transition , which is of the first order for @xmath5 and of the second order otherwise .",
    "we then examine the effects of misfit , which not only change the nature of the order - disorder transition but also brings about a ci transition . in the presence of the misfit ,",
    "correlations due to the inter - chain coupling are observed to favor , depending on the initial configuration , either the commensurate state or an incommensurate state , which gives rise to hysteresis behavior : while in the cooling process the incommensurate cdws persist near zero temperature , in the heating process large portions of the system remain in the commensurate state at rather high temperatures .",

    "this implies that the system still consists of the incommensurate cdws at temperatures where commensurate cdws are supposed to be more stable . for weak coupling ( @xmath225 ) , on the other hand , no discrepancy between the two processes is observed .",
    "it is of interest to compare the hysteresis observed here with the one reported in the specific heat around the ci transition in a number of incommensurate systems.@xcite the latter is attributed to the effects of pinning of the incommensurate modulation due to defects or impurities ; our observation , in contrast , shows that the hysteresis can appear even in the absence of defects , for which inter - chain interactions are responsible .",
    "namely , the inter - chain coupling operates in different ways depending on the process : in the cooling process , correlations between cdw chains due to the inter - chain interactions hinder each cdw chain from getting into the commensurate state . on the contrary , in the heating process , the inter - chain correlations hold each chain close to the zero - temperature ground state until thermal fluctuations become comparable to the inter - chain interaction energy .",

    "the cdw may be pinned in the presence of impurities , sharply decreasing the conductivity .",
    "as the temperature is lowered , therefore , the system for weak quantum or thermal fluctuations becomes insulating via three possible routes , depending on the misfit and the inter - chain interaction : first , the commensurate cdw phase emerges directly from the high - temperature disordered phase ; second , only the incommensurate cdw phase appears , reducing the conductivity ; third , the incommensurate cdw phase appearing first is followed by the commensurate phase emerging via the commensurate - incommensurate transition .",
    "note that beginning with the hamiltonian in eq .",
