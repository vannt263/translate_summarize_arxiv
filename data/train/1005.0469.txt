    "ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) are nonnuclear , point - like x - ray sources in external galaxies with an apparent luminosity over the eddington limit of a stellar - mass black hole , which is typically @xmath3 ergs  s@xmath1 for a 20 @xmath4 black hole .",
    "those with variability on time scales from minutes to months are accreting compact objects .",
    "the nature of ulxs is still unclear .",
    "if the emission is ( roughly ) isotropic and under the eddington limit , they may harbor black holes up to @xmath5  @xmath4 , belonging to the missing population of intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , they could also be stellar - mass black holes , with beamed or super - eddington emission @xcite .",
    "ulxs with relatively low luminosities ( @xmath6  ergs  s@xmath1 ) may be more likely to be stellar - mass black holes of about 10  @xmath4 like galactic bhbs or up to a couple tens of @xmath4 like ic 10 x-1 @xcite .",
    "galactic bhbs have been observed in a few cases with luminosities up to @xmath7 ergs  s@xmath1 @xcite , although there are large uncertainties on their distances .",
    "@xcite proposed that most ulxs are stellar - mass black holes in an ` ultraluminous state ' with super - eddington accretion based on analysis of high quality x - ray spectra .",
    "a major difference between the two populations is that galactic bhbs spend most of their lifetime in the quiescent or low state , while most ulxs have persistent emission and have been active since their discovery at time scales up to decades in some cases .",
    "the non - transient behavior of the majority of ulxs implies that they do not contain black holes significantly more massive than @xmath8  @xmath4 @xcite . despite these hypotheses ,",
    "the connection between ulxs and galactic bhbs has not been well addressed .",
    "if they contain black holes of similar mass , we may expect to see transitions from the normal states to the ultraluminous state in an individual source .",
    "multicolor blackbody emission from an optically thick accretion disk could shed light on the nature of the central black hole . at a fixed fraction of eddington luminosity , the disk inner temperature scales with the black hole mass to the @xmath9 power @xcite , indicating that accretion disks around imbhs are cooler and brighter than those around stellar - mass black holes .",
    "soft excesses are detected in ulxs and can be modeled as cool disk emission from imbhs @xcite .",
    "however , the cool disk model is not the unique interpretation of the soft excess ( for a brief review see the introduction of * ? ? ?",
    "massive outflows due to near or super - eddington accretion may produce blackbody emission at the similar temperature @xcite",
    ".    the disk model can be tested by determining if the disk luminosity varies with the 4th power of the inner disk temperature , i.e.  @xmath10 .",
    "this relation has been robustly verified for stellar - mass black holes when the disk emission dominates the x - ray spectrum @xcite .",
    "although the x - ray spectra of some ulxs can be modeled by dominant disk emission @xcite , the observed luminosity variation and number of observations have been inadequate for proper testing of the @xmath10 relation .",
    "a possible @xmath11 relation was found in ngc 5204 x-1 , but the disk emission was not the dominant component in the spectrum and a large correction for comptonization was required @xcite .",

    "it has been extensively studied in x - rays with the chandra x - ray observatory . in our recent chandra observation on 2008",
    "october 4 , the x - ray source cxom82 j095546.6 + 694041 was 5 - 10 times brighter than its normal flux level and was identified as the third ulx in m82 . according to the naming convention suggested by @xcite",

    "for the five observations ( 379 , 2933 , 8190 , 10025 , 10026 ) in which the spectrum is hard and the luminosity is relatively low , the source may be in the hard state with a power - law spectrum .",

    "the evidence for variability is at a confidence level below 3 @xmath122 .",
    "we found that the source lies near the readout node boundary in observations 5644 and 6361 , causing periodic oscillations when the source position on the detector plane moved across the node boundary due to dithering .",
    "the power spectrum shows a peak at 1000 s which is the dithering period along the direction perpendicular to the boundary .",
    "we therefore created a lightcurve from these two observations with time steps of about 1000  s selected from intervals when the source was at least two pixels away from the readout boundary .",
    "interestingly , there are dip - like variations on time scales of several ks",
    ". simulations using marx 4.4.0 applying the aspect solution file and bad pixel map obtained from the observation indicates that dithering is not responsible for the variations shown in figure  [ fig : lc ] .",
    "we extracted energy spectra from intervals during the dip ( 58.171 - 65.171 ks ) and the nondip ( 28.171 - 56.371 ks ) , which are marked in figure  [ fig : lc ] .",
    "we found that the dip spectrum is softer , with a power - law photon index of @xmath146 versus @xmath147 from the nondip spectrum .",
    "the spectrum during dip is also softer than in the low state , which has a power - law index less than 2.3 .",
    "fitting the nondip spectrum with a blackbody plus mcd model modified by a shared absorption component leads to consistent results with from the entire spectrum .",
    "we then use two absorption components applied onto each emission component individually . for the nondip spectrum ,",
    "the absorption column density @xmath129 on the mcd component is the same as on the blackbody component and is consistent with that derived using a single absorption component . for the dip spectrum ,",
    "the fitting is made by fixing the temperature and @xmath129 of the blackbody component to those of the nondip spectrum , due to limited photon number ; other parameters , the normalization of the blackbody , the mcd and its absorption are free in the fit .",
    "this leads to a best - fit @xmath129 of @xmath148  @xmath124 on the mcd component , which is significantly larger than the @xmath129 from the nondip spectrum , and suggests that the dip may be caused by extra absorption of the mcd component .",
    "the dip and nondip spectra with this blackbody plus mcd model are shown in figure  [ fig : spe ] for comparison .",
    "observation 6361 was performed 62 ks after the end of 5644 .",
    "the source flux in 6361 seems to drop from the nondip level of 5644 to the relatively low level found in other observations .",
    "we searched in the literature and found no infrared or radio counterpart for the x - ray source .",
    "the nearest radio source to x37.8 + 54 is 37.54 + 53.2 @xcite at an angular distance of @xmath149 calculated using the x - ray position of r.a.=@xmath150 and decl.=+@xmath151 ( j2000.0 ) @xcite .",
    "we identify x37.8 + 54 as the third ulx in the starburst galaxy m82 based on its brightening in a recent chandra observation to an observed flux 5 - 10 times higher than previously observed .",
    "the peak isotropic luminosity in the 0.3 - 8 kev band corrected for interstellar absorption is @xmath0  ergs  s@xmath1 inferred from fitting with a power - law model .",
    "the source was often found at relatively low luminosity , near @xmath126  ergs  s@xmath1 . at the lowest luminosities , @xmath152  ergs  s@xmath1 , the source appears to have hard spectra with the photon index less than 2.3 .",
    "as the luminosity increases above this value , it shows dramatic spectral variation with the power - law photon index @xmath153 varying from 1.9 to 3.0 .",
    "this suggests a change in spectral state , and , indeed , most of the higher luminosity spectra are better fitted with an mcd spectral model .",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ fig : mcd ] shows that when observations in the low / hard state are excluded , the remaining observations exhibit a robust correlation between @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "the correlation coefficient between @xmath156 and @xmath157 is 0.997 with a chance probability of @xmath158 .",
    "fitting the data to a power - law relation , we obtained a power - law slope of @xmath2 , consistent with the 4th - power relation predicted for the mcd model in the thermal dominant state .",
    "we note that the disk luminosity varies by about an order of magnitude .",
    "thus , the data provide an adequate test of this relation .",
    "we conclude that x37.8 + 54 exhibits two spectral states : a low / hard state and a thermal dominant state .",
    "following the recipe in @xcite and adopting canonical correction coefficients with @xmath159 and @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is the hardening correction factor and @xmath162 is to correct for the radius of maximum temperature , the disk luminosity can be expressed as a function of the black hole mass ( @xmath163 in solar mass ) and the disk inner temperature ( @xmath155 in kev ) as @xmath164  ergs  s@xmath1 , where @xmath165 is related to the black hole spin with @xmath166 for a non - spinning black hole and @xmath167 for maximal spinning . using a 4th power - law relation to fit the data points in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : mcd ] , we obtain @xmath168  ergs  s@xmath1 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath169 , suggesting the ulx contains a black hole of about 10 solar masses if it is a schwartzchild black hole with a face - on disk , or a few tens solar masses if it is fast spinning or viewed at a high inclination .",
    "the best - fit compact object mass is @xmath133  @xmath4 , derived from fitting with the fully relativistic disk model , indicative of a stellar black hole slightly more massive than galactic ones .",
    "we also tried different hardening correction factors from 1.5 to 1.9 .",
    "the fitted mass varies by 20% with respect to that from @xmath159 .",
    "interestingly , the specific angular momentum converges to its maximally allowed value , @xmath170 with a lower limit of 0.80 , suggesting the source contains a fast spinning black hole .",
    "the mass accretion rate in eddington unit is about 1.0 , which is larger than that found in the thermal dominant state of galactic bhbs of no more than 0.6 @xcite , but is under the theoretical upper limit of about 10 for a stellar - mass black hole with a radiation dominated accretion disk @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated the spectra of six disk - dominated ulxs and found five sources had best - fit masses between 23 and 73 @xmath4 .",
    "the three ulxs that have a derived mass @xmath171 @xmath172 at a confidence @xmath173 also show rapid spin , which is quite similar to x37.8 + 54 .",
    "the best - fit black hole mass of x37.8 + 54 is also similar with that of ic  10  x-1 @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that ic  10  x-1 has a persistently high accretion rate @xcite ; a rapidly spinning black hole is naturally expected since accretion would bring a fair amount of angular momentum to the compact object .",
    "we conclude that stellar kerr black holes with a mass of several tens @xmath4 could appear as ulxs with a thermal spectrum of a few kev in the 1 - 10 kev band , as having been suggested by @xcite .",
    "such emission could also appear as a hard power - law spectrum if the statistics is inadequate to detect the spectral curvature .",
    "these black holes are more massive than galactic black holes , which are mostly around 10 @xmath4 , and may be formed by the collapse of massive stars in a low - metallicity environment and account for a portion of ulxs @xcite .",
    "similar sources , suzaku j1305 - 4931 in ngc 4945 and ngc 253 x-2 , have been reported in the literature , which show a @xmath10 correlation as their luminosities varied by a factor of about 2 - 3 @xcite . from surveys of bright ulxs in nearby galaxies ,",
    "many hard ulxs were found and interpreted as imbhs in the low / hard state @xcite .",
    "for those sources , most of them present a constant spectral index or hardness despite large variation of the luminosity .",
    "therefore , those sources may have a different nature from x37.8 + 54 .",
    "it has been suggested that ulxs are a special case ( face - on ) of the galactic microquasar ss  433 , where super - eddington accretion drives a powerful wind off the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "the wind could be optically thick and produce a blackbody continuum @xcite .",
    "this may be responsible for the soft excess observed in many ulxs with a temperature of about 0.1 - 0.3 kev @xcite . when fitting spectra not from the low / hard state with an mcd component , all observations except 10027 need an additional blackbody component at a significance of at least 3 @xmath122 .",
    "no obvious correlation was found between the luminosity and temperature of the soft blackbody .",
    "however , the uncertainties are large and this result is not very constraining .",
    "the calculated surface area of the soft blackbody emission is about @xmath174  @xmath175 for all observations , corresponding to a spheric radius of @xmath176  cm , about @xmath177 for a 10 solar mass black hole , where @xmath178 is the gravitational radius equal to @xmath179 .",
    "the absorption column density varies significantly between observations no matter what models are used .",
    "such large variation is likely internal to the binary , implying the outflow is inhomogeneous and time variable .",
    "we note that the soft blackbody appears at energies where the absorption is important .",
    "thus caution is warranted when interpreting it .",
    "interesting timing behavior is seen in one of the major outbursts caught by the observations 5644 and 6361 ( figure  [ fig : lc ] ) .",
    "the source shows soft dips on time scales of several ks .",
    "soft dips could be caused by absorption of the inner accretion disk , like in 4u  1630@xmath18047 @xcite .",
    "this interpretation is also consistent with our spectral analysis results in the penultimate paragraph of section 2 .",
    "we note that the soft blackbody component is assumed not to suffer extra absorption",
    ". a dense massive outflow from the disk could be the origin of the extra absorption and also the source of the soft blackbody .",
    "other mechanisms could also produce soft dips , e.g. , the possible ejection of the inner part of accretion disk into relativistic jets in grs  1915@xmath181105 @xcite .",
    "the time scale of ks of the dip in x37.8 + 54 is longer than that in 4u  1630@xmath18047 and in grs  1915@xmath181105 by about an order of magnitude",
    ". more detailed study of the soft dip requires data with better quality .",
    "to summarize , x37.8 + 54 provides us a good candidate of a stellar kerr black hole being ultraluminous with a near eddington accretion rate",
    ". this ulx could be representative of a class of ulxs with relatively low luminosity , i.e.  a few @xmath182  ergs  s@xmath1 .",
    "the luminosity of x37.8 + 54 is usually not high enough to be classified as a ulx , while in the outburst it truly enters the ultralumious regime .",
    "the x - ray spectrum at peak luminosity is dominated by a disk component , which is unlike many brighter ulxs at their maximum luminosity that they enter the ` ultraluminous state ' characterized by a strong comptonizing component @xcite .",
    "therefore , this source may be in between the low luminosity tail of ulxs and high luminosity tail of galactic bhbs .",
    "we note that the hard state of x37.8 + 54 is more luminous than the canonical hard state found in galactic bhbs .",
    "this is consistent with the correlation found in outbursts of bhbs that the peak luminosity of the hard state is scaled with the peak luminosity of the thermal state in the following outburst @xcite .",

    "<S> we report on the identification of a third , new ultraluminous x - ray source ( ulx ) in the starburst galaxy m82 . previously , the source was observed at fluxes consistent with the high state of galactic black hole binaries ( bhbs ) . </S>",

    "<S> when the source is not in the the low / hard state , spectral fitting using a multicolor disk model shows that the disk luminosity varies as the disk inner temperature raised to the power @xmath2 , consistent with the behavior of galactic bhbs in the thermal dominant state . </S>",
    "<S> fitting the spectrum with a multicolor disk model with general relativistic corrections suggests that the source harbors a rapidly spinning black hole with a mass less than 100 solar masses . </S>",
    "<S> a soft excess was found in the source spectrum that could be blackbody emission from a photosphere created by a massive outflow . </S>",
