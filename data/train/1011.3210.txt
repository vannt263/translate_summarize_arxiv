    "the luminosity function of lyman - break galaxy candidates discovered at @xmath3 in the hubble ultra - deep field is described by a schechter function with a characteristic luminosity that decreases towards higher redshift as expected from the dark matter halo mass - function ( e.g. munoz & loeb 2010 ) . at low luminosities ,",

    "we parameterise our models in such a way that the constraints based on the observed size of galaxies are orthogonal to those derived from the slope of the galaxy luminosity function .",
    "based on an empirical determination of parameters of this model , we predict the expected size distribution of galaxies in future surveys with _ jwst _ , and show that existing observations already limit the physical processes that govern the global properties of star formation at high redshifts . where required",

    "to model high redshift galaxy properties we begin with an expression for the uv luminosity of a galaxy within a dark matter halo of mass @xmath12 , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the fraction of baryons turned into stars , @xmath15 is the lifetime of the starburst , and @xmath16 is the average lifetime of the massive stars ( @xmath17 ) that affect the feedback through supernova ( sn ) explosions and dominate the uv luminosity output @xmath18 .",

    "the value of @xmath22 is thought to be related to the dynamical time ( @xmath23 ) of the galactic disk ( kennicutt  1998 ) , which scales as the age of the universe @xmath24 , namely @xmath25^{-3/2}$ ] . equation ( [ eq : l ] ) implies that the luminosity could become independent of the starburst lifetime at sufficiently high redshifts @xmath2 for which @xmath26 .",

    "this parameterisation can be used to describe a range of physical models that predict the unknown variation of the star - formation efficiency and starburst lifetime with redshift and halo mass .",
    "each particular model of the self - regulation of high redshift star formation will yield distinct values for the parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 .    in order to compare the resulting grid of models with the observed evolution in galaxy size we require two further ingredients , namely the virial relation ( simplified form valid at high redshift ) , @xmath33 and the parameterisation , @xmath34 to describe the relation between virial radius @xmath35 and the galactic disk scale radius @xmath36 . in the latter expression",

    "it is also possible to use the observed slope of the luminosity function to constrain the model , thus breaking the degeneracy between the parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 that arises from application of equation  ( [ m ] ) . modelling the galaxy luminosity function using the halo mass function ( @xmath40 ) and the simple parameterised model described in equations  ( [ luminosity]-[parameter ] ) above we find @xmath41 in the mass range @xmath42 ( near or below the non - linear mass scale at @xmath43 ) , the mass function has the local power - law slope @xmath44 . at low luminosities",

    "we also plot in figure  [ fig2 ] , the indicative angular resolutions of telescopes with diameters corresponding to _ hst _ ( @xmath74 m ) , _ jwst _ ( @xmath75 m ) and an extremely large telescope ( elt ; @xmath76 m ) @xmath77 here we have calculated the resolution at the observed wavelength of the redshifted ly@xmath46 line @xmath78 .",
    "this simple comparison suggests that galaxies with an apparent magnitude of @xmath79mag ( 1 magnitude fainter than the _ hst _ wfc3/ir limit ) have an angular size of @xmath80 , which is at the limit of _ hst _ resolution ( oesch et al .",
    "fainter galaxies at higher redshifts can not be resolved by _",
    "the larger aperture of _ jwst _ will allow the study of galaxy structure at higher redshift and fainter fluxes ( windhorst et al .",
    "for example , galaxies with @xmath81mag will be resolved out to at least @xmath82 . moreover , _",
    "jwst _ will be able to resolve galaxies at the magnitude limits of @xmath83 and @xmath0 out to @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively .",
    "galaxies at yet higher redshifts or fainter fluxes would appear point - like .",
    "bright galaxies are known to become rarer toward high redshift ( e.g. bouwens et al .",
    "2010 ; yan et al .",
    "2010 ) , and the discovery of such very high redshift galaxies by _ jwst _ could be limited by its relatively small field of view ( e.g. munoz & loeb  2010 ) .",
    "however , our extrapolation suggests that an _ elt _ would be able to resolve all galaxies detectable with _ jwst_.    the above discussion refers only to angular resolution and neglects surface brightness sensitivity .",
    "calculation of the details of surface brightness sensitivity ( see , e.g. windhorst et al .",
    "2008 ) are beyond the scope of this _",
    "letter_. however , we note that faint , high - redshift galaxies are always below the surface brightness of the sky .",
    "therefore , in order to measure the details of a high redshift galaxy profile , an _ hst _",
    "observation must achieve a very high signal - to - noise ratio on the zodiacal sky ( of order @xmath86 per pixel ) so that the background would be reliably subtracted ( hathi et al .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig2 ] shows the average surface - brightness within the scale - radius of galaxies of various magnitudes as a function of redshift .",
    "galaxies with @xmath71mag show @xmath87 magnitudes per square arcsecond at @xmath43 , becoming fainter by only a modest amount towards @xmath88 .",
    "the plotted curves should be compared to the space based value for the zodiacal sky in the k - band of @xmath89 magnitudes per square arcsecond ( windhorst et al .",
    "2010 ) , or the ground based k - band value of @xmath90 magnitudes per square arcsecond for the thermal sky .",
    "the difference in sky brightness between the ground and space implies that _ hst _ is equivalent in sensitivity ( but not in resolution ) to a 150 m ground - based telescope for the purpose of imaging resolved high redshift galaxies .",
    "thus , a ground - based _ elt _ will not be competitive with _ hst _ or _ jwst _",
    ", since it must overcome the much brighter sky . as a result , even though all high redshift galaxies discovered with _ jwst _ could be resolved by an _ elt _ , their surface brightness will render their extended structure undetectable .",
    "however , high redshift galaxies are observed to be very clumpy owing to the presence of star forming regions ( hathi et al .",
    "2008 ) , and an _ elt _ will be more sensitive to these unresolved clumps than to diffuse structure , owing to the higher resolution in addition to larger collecting area . indeed , _",
    "hst _ is comparable to _ only _ a 20 m ground based telescope with respect to point source sensitivity ( but without the resolution of a 20 m aperture ) .",
    "thus , if high redshift galaxies are sufficiently clumpy , then an _ elt _ may be able to obtain close to the theoretical resolution shown in the central panel of figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "a range of simple models for the process governing star formation can be compared to the constraints on parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "we consider three simple models for the possible feedback .",
    "the first is a model where there is no self regulation of star formation .",
    "the second and third models describe the evolution in cases where the star formation is limited by sn feedback , and the interaction between the sn driven wind and the galactic gas conserves energy and momentum , respectively . in each of these three cases",
    "we consider scenarios where the lifetime of the starburst is proportional to the galaxy dynamical time and to the lifetime of massive stars , respectively .",
    "altogether , we have 6 model predictions for @xmath91 and @xmath92 with which to compare our constraints .",
    "we begin with feedback - free models in which the star formation efficiency @xmath93 .",
    "we first consider the case where the natural timescale for the starburst is proportional to the galaxy dynamical time , @xmath94 , which implies @xmath95 yielding @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "this parameter combination is shown by the solid circles in figure  [ fig1 ] for comparison with the present constraints .",
    "we find that this simple model is inconsistent with both the observed evolution in @xmath36 and the observed luminosity function slope at the @xmath98-sigma level .",
    "the combined constraint rules out this model at high confidence .    however , at the high redshifts when the dynamical time is shorter than the average lifetime of massive stars , the same luminosity may be achieved with a lower star formation rate than in the model described above , @xmath99 yielding @xmath100 for galaxies in this case",
    ". such a model ( shown by the open circular symbols ) is ruled out by the slope of the luminosity function at the 2-sigma level , but is consistent with the observed evolution in galaxy radius .",
    "the combined constraint rules out this model at high confidence .",
    "we next consider models including self - regulation of star formation by supernovae feedback .",
    "the model of wyithe & loeb  ( 2003 ) assumes that star formation is limited by the transfer of energy from sn - driven winds when it is equal to the binding energy to the galactic gas ( dekel & woo 2002 ) .",
    "the model asserts that stars form with an efficiency @xmath14 out of the gas that collapses and cools within a dark matter halo and that a fraction @xmath101 of each supernova energy output , @xmath102 , heats the galactic gas mechanically .",
    "the mechanical feedback will halt the star formation once the cumulative energy returned to the gas by supernovae equals its binding energy ( assuming negligible radiative losses for a sufficiently rapid starburst ) .",
    "hence , in this model the limiting stellar mass is set by the condition @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the mass in stars ( in @xmath105 ) per supernova explosion .",
    "equations  ( [ virial ] ) and ( [ feedback ] ) imply that the total mass in stars , @xmath106 , scales as @xmath107 and hence the star formation efficiency scales as @xmath108 .",
    "thus , smaller galaxies are less efficient at forming stars , but a galaxy of fixed mass is more efficient at forming stars at higher redshift .    in a model where the starburst lifetime is proportional to the galaxy dynamical time ,",
    "we find @xmath109 this model can therefore be parameterised in terms of the combination @xmath110 , and @xmath111 for galaxies , which is shown by the solid diamonds in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "this simple supernovae driven feedback model is inconsistent with the observed evolution in @xmath36 and the luminosity function slope at the @xmath98-sigma level .",
    "the combined constraint rules out this model at high confidence .",
    "however , at high redshifts @xmath2 when the disk dynamical time is shorter than the lifetime of a massive star @xmath112yr , we note that sn feedback will be less efficient , and the star formation efficiency could exceed the self regulated value of @xmath14 described above .",
    "in particular , @xmath113 yielding @xmath110 , and @xmath114 for galaxies in this case ( open diamond symbols ) .",
    "such a model is consistent with the observed evolution of galaxy size , but inconsistent with the slope of the luminosity function at the 2-sigma level .",
    "finally , we consider a model where the sn - driven winds conserve momentum in their interaction with the galactic gas rather than energy . in this case",
    "the limiting stellar mass is set by the condition @xmath115 in a model where the starburst timescale is proportional to the galaxy dynamical time , we find @xmath116 this model ( solid triangles ) , represented by @xmath117 and @xmath118 , is consistent with the constraints from @xmath46 , but ruled out at the 2-sigma level by the constraints from the evolution of galaxy radius .",
    "if instead the lifetime of massive stars sets the starburst timescale , we find @xmath119 which is represented by @xmath117 and @xmath120 , and is plotted as the open triangles in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "this model is consistent with both the constraints from @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "our results imply that sn feedback in high redshift galaxies occurs through the transfer of momentum between the sn - driven wind and the galactic gas , and that the starburst timescale is set by the average lifetime of massive stars rather than the dynamical time of the host galactic disk .",
    "we have used the observed redshift evolution of disk sizes , and luminosity function of galaxies to constrain the relationship between star formation efficiency and starburst lifetime .",
    "we find that supernova feedback in high redshift galaxies is likely mediated through momentum transfer with the starburst timescale dictated by the average lifetime of the massive stars , @xmath16 .",
    "the latter result follows naturally from the fact that the dynamical time of galactic disks becomes shorter than @xmath121 yr at redshifts @xmath122 .",
    "we extrapolated the derived scaling relations to predict the angular sizes of galaxies at higher redshifts and fainter fluxes than currently observed .",
    "we have found that _",
    "jwst _ will be able to resolve galaxies with @xmath83 and @xmath0 only out to redshifts of @xmath123 and @xmath85 , respectively .",
