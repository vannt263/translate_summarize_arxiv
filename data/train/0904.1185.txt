    "<S> structure of the spin - orbit coupling varies from material to material and thus finding the correct spin - orbit coupling structure is an important step towards advanced spintronic applications . </S>",
    "<S> we show theoretically that the curvature in a carbon nanotube generates two types of the spin - orbit coupling , one of which was not recognized before . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the topological phase - related contribution of the spin - orbit coupling , which appears in the off - diagonal part of the effective dirac hamiltonian of carbon nanotubes , there is another contribution that appears in the diagonal part . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of the diagonal term can modify spin - orbit coupling effects qualitatively , an example of which is the electron - hole asymmetric spin splitting observed recently , and generate four qualitatively different behavior of energy level dependence on parallel magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that the diagonal term applies to a curved graphene as well . </S>",
    "<S> this result should be valuable for spintronic applications of graphitic materials . </S>"
