    "the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy as one of important issue in isospin physics has been studied for the past few decades because of its very importance not only in understanding the structure of radiative nuclei in nuclear physics @xcite but also its crucial roles in nuclear astrophysics @xcite . up to now , although many useful experimental observables @xcite have been proposed to determine the nuclear symmetry energy in heavy - ion collisions , they have had limited success because of its sensitivity not only to nuclear symmetry energy but also other poorly known physical effects @xcite . nevertheless , a key step in determining the nuclear symmetry energy is the determination of experimental observables which can be serve as clean and sensitive probes @xcite .",
    "therefore , the search of the experimental observables sensitive only to nuclear symmetry energy than others is a crucial task in determination of nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "it is well known that heavy - ion reactions induced by neutron - rich nuclei provide an important opportunity to constrain the symmetry energy in a broad density range @xcite . to initialize transport models of heavy - ion reactions ,",
    "it is necessary to know the nucleon density profiles for the two colliding nuclei .",
    "generally speaking , one should use the thomas - fermi method to extract the density profiles for the colliding nuclei .",
    "practically , one usually use other methods to approximate thomas - fermi method during initializing the colliding nuclei such as the droplet model used in the isospin - dependent quantum molecular dynamics ( iqmd ) model @xcite and the skyrme hartree - fock model used in the isospin - dependent boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( ibuu ) model @xcite . in any case , the initialization should guarantee the numerical stabilization of colliding nuclei and fit the bulk nuclei properties as good as possible ; see , e.g. , refs.@xcite .",
    "the main problem of these methods is the numerical stability of initial colliding nuclei in the subsequent reaction .",
    "however , this allows one to easily separate effects on the final observables due to the initial state from those due to the reactions @xcite .",
    "based on this consideration , by examining the relative effects of neutron - skin size in initial nuclei and the symmetry energy at suprasaturation densities reached in heavy - ion collisions on the charged pion ratio in the final state , we have shown recently that the ratio is sensitive not only to nuclear symmetry energy but also the neutron - skin size of initial colliding nuclei especially in peripheral collisions , see ref .",
    "@xcite . nevertheless , as mentioned above a crucial task in determination of symmetry energy is to find the clean experimental observables . under this consideration in mind",
    ", we are going to find which experimental observables are sensitive to nuclear symmetry energy than neutron - skin size difference of initial colliding nuclei . to this end , in this work we investigate how to eliminate the influence of the neutron - skin size difference of initial colliding nuclei in probing the nuclear symmetry energy in pb+pb heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it can be found later that the combined neutron - proton collective flow and stopping power can effectively eliminate the effects of neutron - skin size difference of initial colliding nuclei but keep the effects of symmetry energy especially at the lower beam energy .",
    "in this part we briefly describe the model used in the present study , i.e. , the isospin- and momentum - dependent boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck transport model @xcite of version ibuu11 @xcite .",
    "the momentum dependence of both the isoscalar @xcite and isovector @xcite parts of the nuclear interaction is important in understanding not only many phenomena in intermediate - energy heavy - ion collisions but also thermodynamical properties of isospin - asymmetric nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "the mean - field potential for a nucleon with momentum @xmath1 and isospin @xmath2 can be written as @xcite @xmath3 in the above , @xmath4 is the nucleon number density and @xmath5 is the isospin asymmetry of the nuclear medium ; @xmath6 denotes the neutron ( proton ) density , isospin @xmath2 is @xmath7 for neutrons and @xmath8 for protons , and @xmath9 is the local phase space distribution function .",
    "the expressions and values of the parameters @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 can be found in refs .",

    "although these available data suffer from large uncertainties , it was shown very recently within a relativistic mean - field model @xcite that a neutron - skin for @xmath0pb as thick as @xmath35 fm reported by the prex - i experiment @xcite can not be ruled out although most other studies have reported much smaller average values albeit largely overlapping with the prex - i result within error bars .",
    "it is expected that the proton distributions are almost identical , while the neutrons distribute differently in the two cases considered .    before showing the results of the studies",
    ", one must check the stability of the ground state nucleus . to this end",
    ", one can check the time evolution of the rms radius difference between neutrons and protons in the projectile and/or target with impact parameter to be infinite in the reaction model .",
    "this is because when the impact parameter is infinite , the projectile and target can not touch with each other and the corresponding interaction between them becomes zero , they are in their ground states and move along their initial trajectory ; it is naturally that the initial rms radius difference between neutrons and protons remains unchanged . shown in fig .",
    "[ gscheck ] is the evolution of the rms radius difference between neutrons and protons initially setting as 0.1fm both in the projectile and target for different impact parameters at beam energies of 400mev / nucleon , respectively .",
    "firstly , it can be found that the value of the rms radius difference between neutrons and protons decreases rapidly with the impact parameter decreasing due to the interactions between the projectile and target as well as the corresponding collisions among nucleons increasing .",
    "secondly , it is expected that the initial rms radius difference between neutrons and protons in the projectile and/or target approximately approaches stable as the impact parameter increasing to be 20fm .",
    "certainly , a long - period and small - amplitude oscillation of the rms radius difference is still seen due to the distance between the projectile and target inadequate far and the tiny fluctuation from collisions between nucleons in the same nucleus",
    ". however , this level of stability of the ground state nucleus more or less lasts long enough , which should be reflected in the final reaction production .",
    "we now present results of the study in the following . considering that there is no obvious neutron - skin effects in head - on heavy - ion reactions",
    "as shown in our previous work @xcite , we thus carry out this study in semicentral and peripheral @xmath0pb+@xmath0pb collisions with impact parameters of 5 and 9fm . on the other hand , to distinguish the difference of neutron - skin size of @xmath31=0.1 and 0.3fm , we have performed large scale calculations with @xmath36 events in each case reported here .",
    "thus , the statistical error bars are smaller than the plotting symbols in most plots . in addition",
    ", the percentage used in some figure is to avoid too much numerical digit after the decimal .",
    "the elliptic flow has been widely used to study the properties of the hot and dense matter formed in the early stage of heavy - ion collisions at relativistic and intermediate energies , see , e.g. , refs .",

    "it can be found that the elliptic flow of nucleons shows a transition from in - plane to out - of - plane with the beam energy increasing from 50 to 1000mev / nucleon .",
    "this is because at the lower beam energies , the mean field dominates the reaction dynamics and causes the in - plane enhancement of emitted reaction products , while with the beam energies increasing , the mean field becomes less important and the collective expansion process based on nucleon - nucleon scattering starts to be predominant , and the squeezed out elliptic flow as the result of shadowing of spectator starts to become negative @xcite .",

    "it is expected that the neutron - proton differential elliptic flow shows obvious sensitivity to the symmetry energy .",
    "this can be understandable since the combined elliptic flow constructively maximizes the effects of the symmetry potential but minimizes the effects of the isoscalar potential similar to that of neutron - proton differential transverse flow proposed by li @xcite .",

    "<S> within an isospin- and momentum - dependent transport model using as an input nucleon density profiles from hartree - fock calculations based on a modified skyrme - like ( msl ) model , we study how to eliminate the influence of neutron - skin size difference of initial colliding nuclei in probing the nuclear symmetry energy . within the current experimental uncertainty range of neutron - skin size of @xmath0pb , </S>",
    "<S> the pb+pb collisions are performed in semicentral and peripheral collisions with impact parameters of 5 and 9fm and at beam energies from 50 mev / nucleon to 1000 mev / nucleon , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that combination of neutron and proton collective flows , i.e. , neutron - proton differential elliptic flow , neutron - proton elliptic flow difference , neutron - proton differential transverse flow and neutron - proton transverse flow difference , can effectively eliminate the effects of neutron - skin size difference and thus can be as useful sensitive observables in probing nuclear matter symmetry energy in heavy - ion collisions . moreover , the combined neutron - proton stopping power including the neutron - proton differential stopping power and neutron - proton stopping power difference can also eliminate the effects of neutron - skin size difference and shows some sensitivities to symmetry energy especially at the lower beam energy . </S>"
