    "the quantum search algorithm was a somewhat surprising result since it gave a means of searching @xmath6items in only @xmath1 steps @xcite .",
    "it was surprising because unlike most computer science applications , the problem under consideration did not have any structure that the algorithm could make use of .",
    "it is easy to see that any classical algorithm , whether probabilistic or deterministic , would need @xmath7 oracle queries - it had generally been assumed that @xmath7 steps would be required by _ any _ algorithm .",
    "however , quantum mechanical systems can be in multiple states simultaneously and there is no clearly defined bound on how rapidly they can search .",
    "it was proved through subtle properties of unitary transformations that any quantum system would need at least @xmath8 queries to search @xmath0 items @xcite .",
    "subsequently , after the quantum search algorithm was invented , it was proved that the number of queries required by the algorithm was optimal and could not be improved even by one @xcite .",
    "this is usually expressed by saying that `` the quantum search algorithm is the best possible algorithm for exhaustive search . ''",
    "it is true that the number of queries required probably can not be reduced , however , as this paper shows , there is scope for improvement in the total number of operations required by the algorithm .",
    "this is achieved by breaking up the non - query transformations into bitwise operations in a way somewhat reminiscent of the techniques used to improve the sorting algorithm beyond the information theoretic limit @xcite .",
    "it is shown that by slightly increasing the number of queries , the total number of operations can be reduced by a logarithmic factor .",
    "this is accomplished by making use of the amplitude amplification principle .",
    "a few years after the invention of the quantum search algorithm , it was generalized to a much larger class of applications known as the amplitude amplification algorithms @xcite ( similar results are independently proved in @xcite ) . in these algorithms ,",
    "the amplitude produced in a particular state by a unitary operation @xmath9 , can be _ amplified _ by successively repeating the sequence of operations :  @xmath10 .",
    "it was proved that if we start from the @xmath11 state and repeat the operation sequence @xmath12 @xmath13 times followed by a single repetition of @xmath9 , then the amplitude in the @xmath14 state becomes approximately 2@xmath15 ( provided @xmath16 ) . also , if we start from @xmath11 and carry out @xmath17 repetitions of @xmath18 followed by a single repetition of @xmath19 we reach @xmath14 with certainty .",
    "the quantum search algorithm is a particular case of this with @xmath9 being the walsh - hadamard transformation ( @xmath20 ) and @xmath11 being the @xmath21 state .",
    "the power of the amplitude amplification technique lies in the fact that @xmath22can be _ any _ unitary operation . once we can design a unitary operation ( or a sequence of unitary operations )",
    "@xmath9 , that produce a certain amplitude in the target state , the amplitude amplification principle gives a prescription for _ amplifying _ this amplitude .",
    "the amount of amplification increases linearly with the number of repetitions of @xmath18 and hence the probability of detecting @xmath14 goes up quadratically . for many applications",
    "this results in a square - root speed up over the equivalent classical algorithm .    in this paper",
    "we use the amplitude amplification principle for enhancing the quantum search algorithm .",
    "this is achieved by designing a sequence of bitwise operations that produce almost the same amplitude in the @xmath14 state while requiring a much smaller number of operations",
    ".    there have been several extensions of the quantum search algorithm as well as several applications of the algorithm to problems not immediately related to searching ; however the result presented in this paper is the first improvement of the quantum search algorithm for the original exhaustive search problem .",
    "as mentioned before , the quantum search algorithm is a particular case of amplitude amplification with the walsh - hadamard transformation being the @xmath9 operation and @xmath11 being the @xmath23 state . for any @xmath14 , @xmath24 it follows from the amplitude amplification principle that if we start from @xmath23 and carry out @xmath25 repetitions of the sequence of operations @xmath26 followed by @xmath20 , we reach the @xmath14 state with certainty .",
    "let @xmath0 be the number of items being searched .",
    "then @xmath28 requires us to calculate the and  of @xmath29 boolean variables which can be carried out by @xmath29 c@xmath30not  operations .",
    "@xmath20 requires @xmath31 one - qubit operations .",
    "thus the total number of  additional ( non - query ) qubit operations required by the algorithm is @xmath32 while the number of queries required is @xmath33 in the following section we show how to reduce the number of additional ( non - query ) qubit operations while keeping the number of queries approximately the same .",
    "there have been several interpretations of the quantum search algorithm sch .",
    "one of the ways the algorithm was first presented was in terms of an _ inversion about average _",
    "transformation @xcite . in this paper , the inversion about average transformation is combined with the amplitude amplification technique to obtain a faster algorithm for exhaustive search . before presenting the new algorithm , we first recall the inversion about average transformation .",
    "consider the operation sequence : @xmath34 .",
    "this may be written as : @xmath35 @xmath36 or equivalently @xmath37 .",
    "the transformation @xmath38 can be represented as an @xmath39 matrix with each entry equal to @xmath40 . to see this recall that @xmath41 where @xmath42 denote the binary representation of @xmath43and @xmath44 @xmath45 denotes the bitwise dot product of @xmath42 .",
    "clearly if either @xmath46 or @xmath47 is @xmath48 then @xmath49 and @xmath50therefore @xmath51 is an @xmath39 matrix with each entry equal to @xmath52 and each element of the transformed vector is equal to the average of all elements of the initial vector , i.e. if the @xmath53 component of the input vector , @xmath54 , is @xmath55 , then each component of the vector @xmath56 is @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "hence the @xmath53 component of the transformed vector @xmath59 is equal to @xmath60 this may be written as @xmath61 i.e. the @xmath53 component in the transformed vector is as much below the average as the @xmath53 component in the initial vector was above the average , i.e. this transformation is an _ inversion about average . _    as mentioned before , the quantum search algorithm consists of the operation sequence : @xmath62 it is insightful to write this as : @xmath63 . in terms of the inversion about average transformations ,",
    "this has the following interpretation :    1 .",
    "@xmath64 the @xmath65operation applied to @xmath66 creates a superposition with equal amplitude in each of the @xmath0 states .",
    "@xmath67 selectively inverts the amplitude in the target state.next the following sequence of operations ( 3 - 4 ) is repeated @xmath68 times : 3 .",
    "as described above , this is the inversion about average transformation .",
    "the average amplitude @xmath69 is approximately equal to the amplitude of the @xmath70 non - target states .",
    "therefore as a result of this transformation , the amplitude in the non - target states is unaltered .",
    "since the @xmath14 state is inverted , its amplitude is below the average . as described in @xcite , its amplitude changes sign and its magnitude increases by 2@xmath71 4 .",
    "@xmath67 selectively inverts the amplitude in the target state thus undoing the sign change in ( 3 ) .",
    "this prepares the system for the next inversion about average operation through which the magnitude of the amplitude in the @xmath14 state is increased .    * figure 1 ( see attached",
    "file ) : the transformation * @xmath72 * *  performs an inversion about average in each of the four subsets of states - the four subsets are defined by the condition that the qubits not in s  stay fixed ( in the above figure , the qubits not in s  are qubits 1 & 2 ) , e.g. in the first subset , qubits 1 &  2 are both 0 . * *",
    "assume there to be @xmath73 qubits , then as described in the previous section , @xmath74 does an inversion about average transformation on the entire set of @xmath75 states .",
    "consider a set that contains @xmath76 of the @xmath73 qubits , denote this set by @xmath77 .",
    "define the walsh - hadamard transformation on @xmath77 as the operation @xmath78 $ ] , applied to each qubit in the set @xmath77 and denote this by @xmath79 .",
    "similarly define the operation @xmath80 as the selective inversion of the state in which each qubit in @xmath77 is 0 .    consider the following transformation @xmath81 its effect is to partition the states into subsets such that in each subset the qubits that are not in @xmath77 stay fixed .",
    "this transformation leaves the total probability in each subset the same - within each subset , an _ inversion about average _ transformation takes place . in the above figure the set @xmath77  contains qubits 3 &  4 .",
    "it partitions the state into 4 subsets in which the qubits _ not _ in the set are fixed , e.g. in the first subset , qubits 1 & 2 are both 0 .",
    "the transformation @xmath82 does an inversion about average separately in each of the four subsets .",
    "as discussed above , the quantum search algorithm increases the amplitude in the @xmath14 state through successive repetitions of selective inversion and inversion about average .",
    "the inversion about average operation increases the amplitude in the @xmath14 state by an amount equal to the average amplitude over all states .",
    "the inversion about average requires three transformations : @xmath83 each of which requires @xmath29 qubit operations . in the following ,",
    "we show how to carry out the inversion about average transformations over a smaller subset of states thus requiring fewer than @xmath29 qubit operations .",
    "as mentioned earlier in section 3 , the amplitude amplification principle requires a basic transformation @xmath9 that produces a certain transition amplitude , @xmath84 from @xmath11 to @xmath14 .",
    "this can then be iterated as in section 3 , to amplify the amplitude in @xmath14 .",
    "divide the @xmath29 qubits used to represent the @xmath0 items into sets of @xmath85 qubits ( @xmath86 . since there are @xmath87 qubits , there will be @xmath88 sets .",
    "define the walsh - hadamard transformation on the @xmath89 set as the operation @xmath90 $ ] , applied to each qubit in the set and denote this by @xmath91 .",
    "similarly define the operation @xmath92 as the selective inversion of the state in which each qubit in the @xmath53 set is 0 .",
    "next consider the following transformation:@xmath93    * figure 2 - ( see attached file ) - the inversion about average transformation in the standard quantum search algorithm  is replaced by two such operations - one that acts on the horizontal sets & the other on the vetical sets . *    when applied to the @xmath94 state , it has the following effect :    1 .",
    "the first application of @xmath20 produces a superposition with equal amplitudes in all states .",
    "+ after this , each application of @xmath95 does the following .",
    "2 .   @xmath67 inverts the amplitude in the target state .",
    "3 .   @xmath96 does a partial _ inversion about average _ in each subset of states defined by the condition that the state of all qubits _ not _ in the @xmath53 set stays constant ( as shown in figure 1 ) .    next consider the effect of steps 2 & 3 on the subset of states that contains @xmath14 .",
    "let the amplitude of the @xmath14 state be @xmath97 .",
    "after step 2 , the amplitude of @xmath14 becomes @xmath98    after step 2 , the amplitude of each of the other states in the subset containing @xmath14 is the same as after step 1 , i.e. @xmath99 .",
    "this is because the first @xmath100 inversion about average transformations act on subsets of states in which the value of the @xmath53 qubit is constant .",
    "hence they produce no change in the amplitude of any state in which the value of the @xmath53 qubit is different from the value of the @xmath53 qubit in the @xmath14 state .",
    "the number of states in each subset is @xmath101 which is @xmath102 .",
    "therefore the average amplitude in the @xmath53 subset of states containing @xmath14 is @xmath103 .",
    "step 3 ( the partial inversion about average ) , increases the amplitude in @xmath14 to @xmath104 .",
    "assuming @xmath105 the increase in amplitude of @xmath14 due to 2 &  3 is at least @xmath106 therefore in the @xmath13 repetitions of 2 & 3 , the amplitude of @xmath14 increases by at least @xmath107    the operation @xmath9 described by 1 , 2 & 3 above , forms the building block for the amplitude amplification algorithm described in the following section .",
    "as described in the analysis above , the composite operation @xmath9 when applied to @xmath94 produces an amplitude of at least @xmath108 in @xmath14 .",
    "therefore by the amplitude amplification principle , @xmath109  repetitions of the @xmath110 operation sequence followed by a single application of @xmath9 ,  will concentrate the amplitude in the @xmath14 state .",
    "note that @xmath111 consists of the same operations as @xmath9 but in the opposite order:@xmath112      each application of @xmath9 requires @xmath13 queries .",
    "therefore in each application of @xmath110 there are @xmath113 queries .",
    "neglecting the single application of @xmath9 at the end , it follows that the total number of queries is : @xmath114    this is less than @xmath115 .",
    "the total number of applications of @xmath9 in the algorithm is @xmath116 ( as before , neglecting the single application of @xmath117 at the end ) .",
    "the number of additional ( non - query ) qubit operations required in each application of @xmath9 is log@xmath118 which is equal to @xmath119 .",
    "the total number of additional ( non - query ) qubit operations due to the @xmath9 & @xmath111 hence becomes @xmath120 in addition there are @xmath121 @xmath122 operations each of which requires @xmath87 operations .",
    "therefore the total number of additional ( non - query ) qubit operations required is @xmath123 .",
    "this is less than @xmath124 provided @xmath125",
    "the quantum search algorithm needs @xmath126 queries and @xmath127 additional ( non - query ) qubit operations .",
    "the algorithm of the previous section needs fewer than @xmath128 queries and less than @xmath129 additional ( non - query ) qubit operations ( provided @xmath130 , note that the ratio of the additional ( non - query )  qubit operations required by the two algorithms is @xmath131      in case ( @xmath132 is @xmath133 , then the number of queries required by the improved algorithm is less than @xmath134 , i.e. the increase in the number of queries as compared to that required by the standard quantum search algorithm seems to be less than one .",
    "however this is only suggestive since several other effects become significant when @xmath4 becomes this large ( and therefore @xmath135 the number of sets of qubits , which was@xmath136 becomes small ) .",
    "in fact the smallest value for @xmath13 is 2 .",
    "we analyze this case separately below .",
    "this is perhaps the simplest example of the partial inversion about average .",
    "the qubits are partitioned into two sets with @xmath137 qubits in each set .",
    "then the basic @xmath9  operation is the following :    @xmath138    a simple analysis shows that the amplitude in the @xmath14 state after applying @xmath117 to the @xmath48 state ( which is @xmath84 ) becomes @xmath139an amplitude amplification as described previously in this paper will now amplify this amplitude .    to compare this to the standard quantum search algorithm ,",
    "observe that the standard quantum search algorithm is obtained by taking @xmath9 to be as follows :    @xmath140    this produces a @xmath84 of @xmath141 . since the number of queries is known to be proportional to @xmath142 , the number of additional queries required by the new algorithm is obtained by scaling the queries required by the standard quantum search .",
    "this gives the number of additional queries as approximately : @xmath143 note that such a small increase in the number of queries is not likely to be significant since it would typically take the quantum search algorithm @xmath144 queries to go from an approximate to the exact solution .",
    "the number of additional ( non - query ) qubit operations required can be compared to the standard quantum search by comparing the two @xmath9 operations . assuming each @xmath20 and @xmath28 need twice the number of operations as compared to @xmath145 , @xmath146",
    ", it follows that the new algorithm will need only @xmath147 as many operations as compared to standard quantum searching .",
    "if we permit a very slight increase in the number of queries , the number of additional unitary operations and hence the total number of operations can be significantly reduced .",
    "assume that each query requires @xmath148 qubit operations , where @xmath149 is order 1 .",
    "this is plausible since the query is a function of @xmath29 qubits and so would need @xmath150 steps to evaluate .",
    "the total number of qubit operations is hence approximately:@xmath151    differentiating with respect to @xmath4 and setting the derivative to zero gives the condition:@xmath152    this gives @xmath153 substituting in the expression for the total number of operations gives:@xmath154    in comparison the standard quantum search algorithm requires@xmath155 qubit operations .",
    "therefore the number of additional two - qubit operations has been reduced by a factor of @xmath156",
    "the goal of this paper is to make a statement that the quantum search algorithm can be further improved .",
    "it is hoped that this will lead to further research in this direction .",
    "there is scope for further improvements in the algorithm presented in this paper , though at the cost of more complicated calculations .",
    "some of these improvements , such as modifying the @xmath157 operation to include multiple inversions about average in each subset , are being explored and will be presented in more detail later .",
