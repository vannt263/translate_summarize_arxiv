    "although stellar mass black holes ( @xmath14 , e.g. , belczynski et al .  2010 ) and supermassive black holes ( @xmath15 ) are now known entities ( as reviewed in kormendy & ho 2013 and graham 2015a ) , there remains a paucity of intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) . while there are well over 100 galaxies believed to contain black holes with masses in the range @xmath16 ( e.g. , greene & ho 2004 ; jiang et al .",

    "the notation @xmath20 indicates that a virial factor @xmath21 was used to derive the black hole mass .",
    "] , few imbh candidates are currently known .",
    "however , a battery of indirect methods have been used to imply their existence .",
    "for example , perhaps the best such candidate is the hyperluminous x - ray source hlx-1 ( @xmath22@xmath23 ) , situated off - center in the lenticular galaxy eso  243 - 49 ( farrell et al .",

    "there are three groups of sources touted as imbh candidates , namely : _",
    "( i ) _ some highly - luminous , off - center , accreting sources in galaxies , such as hlx-1 in eso  243 - 49 ( these hyperluminous x - ray sources are special cases among the so called ultraluminous x - ray sources ) ergs , while hyperluminous x - ray sources have @xmath24 ergs ( gao et al .",

    "_ ( quiescent ) black hole candidates in massive globular clusters which have been proposed from dynamical modelling ( wyller 1970 ; lutzgendorf et al .",
    "2013 , and references therein ) but not yet convincingly detected ( e.g. , lanzoni 2015 and references therein ) .",
    "the three groups may or may not have a distinct physical origin .",
    "for example , a source that appears as an off - center hyperluminous x - ray source today may have been the nucleus of an accreted and stripped dwarf satellite galaxy ( e.g. , drinkwater et al .",
    "2003 ; seth et al .",
    "2014 ) , or perhaps an ejected nucleus ( e.g. , gualandris & merritt 2008 ; komossa & merritt 2008 ; merritt et al .",
    "ngc  2276 - 3c is one such off - center x - ray source and probable imbh , with a reported mass of @xmath25@xmath26 ( mezcua et al .",
    "another off - center example can be found in the bulgeless disk galaxy ngc  4178 , with a reported black hole mass of @xmath27 ; and the center of this galaxy may harbour another black hole , in the mass range @xmath28@xmath29 ( secrest et al .",

    "if such imbhs ( see also oka et al .",
    "2015 ) migrate to the centers of bulges through dynamical friction , it stands to reason that they may contribute to the apparent bulge-(black hole ) connection if the inward bound imbh is of significant mass compared to any black hole mass currently at the center of the galaxy in question .",
    "thus , it is thought that the centrally - located , intermediate and supermassive black holes may not necessarily originate from a single seed , but rather many .    while a few imbh candidates are known , as noted above , the galaxy leda  87300 ( referred to as `` rgg  118 '' by baldassare et al .",
    "2015 ; hereafter brgg15 ) , hosts a particularly interesting imbh candidate because it is centrally located in this galaxy s bulge .",
    "this galaxy can therefore be used to probe the low - mass end of the ( black hole mass)-(host bulge ) diagrams and scaling relations . these include ( i ) the @xmath30@xmath12 relation ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",

    "the nature of these black hole scaling relations at low masses is not only of interest for probing into the realm of the largely ` missing ' population of imbhs , but is expected to provide insight into the seed black holes that grew into supermassive black holes ( e.g. , madau & rees 2001 ; miller & hamilton 2002 ; portegies zwart & mcmillan 2002 ; johnson et al .",

    "are randomly offset to the lower right of the @xmath4@xmath31 relations defined by high mass `` classical '' bulges  an idea introduced by graham ( 2008 ) and hu ( 2008 )  graham ( 2012 , 2015a ) has since shown that a steeper than linear relation exists for pseudobulges and low - mass classical bulges alike . in particular , a near - quadratic relation was found for the srsic spheroids ( @xmath36 ) while a near - linear relation was found for the core - srsic spheroids ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "savorgnan et al .  (",
    "2015 ) have since revealed that an alternative division may be between the early - type ( red sequence ) galaxies ( with @xmath38 ) and the late - type ( blue sequence ) galaxies which define a relation @xmath39 .",
    "using virial black hole masses , the bend in the @xmath4@xmath31 relation can now be seen all the way down to @xmath40 ( graham & scott 2015 ) .",
    "spheroids with imbh candidates are needed to test if this steep relation continues to yet lower masses .",

    "importantly , it additionally shows , for the first time , where this imbh resides relative to the extrapolation to low masses of the near - quadratic scaling relation constructed at higher masses .",
    "the agreement is striking .",
    "this is important because , if confirmed , it suggests that we can predict the masses of ( at least the more massive ) imbhs .",
    "it is obviously important to perform a correct decomposition of a galaxy s light if we are to obtain the physical properties of the spheroidal component and properly explore the ( black hole)-(host spheroid ) connection .",
    "this is true at both ends of the mass spectrum .",
    "for example , isolating the spheroid light from that of the galaxy has recently resulted in the discovery of the missing population of compact , massive spheroids observed at high - redshifts ( referred to as red nuggets by damjanov et al .",
    "2009 ) but previously thought to be absent in the nearby universe ( graham , dullo & savorgnan 2015 ) . at the same time",
    ", other studies which fit _ large - scale _ disks to some of these nearby galaxies which actually contain _ intermediate - scale _ disks has resulted in the under - estimation of the spheroid mass and thus the erroneous claims of overly high @xmath42 ratios , as explained in savorgnan & graham ( 2015b ) .    here",
    "we provide an independent decomposition for the barred galaxy leda  87300 , to check if its low - mass spheroidal component follows the near - quadratic @xmath4@xmath13 relation as seen in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "although brgg15 performed a bulge / disk decomposition , they reported a bulge - to - disk ratio of @xmath250.3 .",
    "this is unusually high for an sm galaxy ( see graham & worley 2008 ) , and appears to have arisen because they lumped the bar plus bulge light together , fitting for what we call the `` barge '' .",
    "this also means that the srsic index for the bulge component of this galaxy is yet to be measured .",
    "in section  [ sec_data ] we present the imaging data and our decomposition analysis , refitting for both the `` barge''+disk and the bar+bulge+disk .",
    "to be thorough , in section  3 we additionally revisit the derived black hole mass , the spheroid velocity dispersion , and the x - ray data which suggested the presence of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",

    "we did this for the @xmath53- and @xmath50-band images , but not the @xmath51-band image because it is too faint .",
    "galaxy images are not always well approximated by 2-dimensional models whose components have fixed ellipticity ( @xmath59 ) and position angle ( p.a . ) .",
    "instead , we have used 1-dimensional ` light profiles ' and the associated geometrical profiles which track a galaxy s variation in @xmath59 , p.a . , and isophotal deviation from ellipses  as quantified using fourier harmonics .",
    "collectively , this suite of 1-dimensional profiles describe and recreate the symmetrical elements of a 2d image . the isofit task ( ciambur 2015 )",
    "was used to obtain both the major - axis and the geometric - mean - axis ( equivalent to a circularized ) light profile , and its accompaniments at each radius ( i.e.  position angle , ellipticity , fourier terms ) . as can be seen in the right hand panel of figure  [ fig4 ] ,",
    "the 1d profiles perform well at representing the galaxy and reveal three spiral arms in the residual map . to avoid redundancy , we do not show the similar set of @xmath53-band image , mask and residual map , although we do note that the @xmath53-band profiles could only be reliably extracted to half the radial extent of the @xmath50-band profile .",
    "having extracted the @xmath53- and @xmath50-band light profiles ( shown in figures  [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] ) , they have then been decomposed into model components ( point - source , bar , bulge , disk ) using the _ profiler _ software ( ciambur 2016 , in preparation ) .",
    "` profiler ' finds the optimal decomposition of a light profile through an iterative minimization process using the levenberg - marquardt algorithm ( marquardt 1963 ) . at each iteration step , the components are summed together and then convolved with the point spread function ( psf )  using a hybrid ( fast fourier transform)-based and numerical convolution scheme  to generate a model profile .",
    "profiler can use a gaussian , moffat , or any user - supplied vector to describe the psf .",
    "the best - fit values for the galaxy model parameters are then found by minimizing the root mean square scatter @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the number of fitted data points in the light profile and @xmath62 is the number of model parameters .",
    "it should be remembered that @xmath63 reflects the quality of the global fit .",
    "it can therefore be beneficial to also watch the behavior of the residual profile over specific regions of interest .",
    "while a ( signal - to - noise)-weighted fitting scheme can be used , it is generally preferable not to do so due to the myriad of potential biases ( above the poissonian noise expected from the galaxy ) affecting the inner light profiles of galaxies where the signal is highest .",
    "sources of bias can include central dust , a faint agn , additional components such as a nuclear star cluster or a nuclear disk , and errors in the psf , all of which become more important when using a ( signal - to - noise)-weighted scheme . while this danger is considerably reduced through the use @xmath63 ,",
    "one is more susceptible to biases from an incorrect sky - background subtraction when using this statistic . in the case of leda  87300",
    ", it has a non - exponential disk which we avoided by restricting the radial range used , and thus we are not using data that could be overly susceptible to errors from the sky - background subtraction process . in passing we",
    "note that even if we had modelled the disk with a broken , inner and outer , exponential function ( e.g. , pohlen et al .  2002 ; pohlen & trujillo 2005 ) , it would not have affected our results for the spheroid .",
    "the imexamine task in iraf was used to fit gaussian profiles to a dozen stars in each of the final @xmath53- and @xmath50-band images , and the mean full width half maximum ( fwhm ) used to characterize our gaussian psf .",
    "initially we fit the same model components as brgg15 , namely a point - source , an exponential disk , plus a single srsic ( 1963 ) @xmath64 function equals 1.0 and 0.5 , respectively , can be found in graham & driver ( 2005 ) .",
    "] for the combined bar+bulge ( `` barge '' ) , as shown in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "we obtained a notably smaller @xmath50-band srsic index for the barge than brgg15 ( 0.41 compared to 1.13 ) , and a barge luminosity which is less than two times as bright .",
    "our uncorrected @xmath50-band barge magnitude of 19.29 mag and disk magnitude of 16.82 mag give a barge - to - disk flux ratio of @xmath250.10 .",
    "given that the bulge - to - disk flux ratio is typically just a few percent for scd  sm galaxies ( e.g. , graham & worley 2008 ) , this is additional evidence ( beyond simply looking at the 2d image and the 1d profile ) that the bar is likely contributing to the barge light color of 0.41@xmath460.03 and a bluer barge color of 0.37 , albeit with an uncertainty of 0.05 . ] . while at some stage bars become bulges within the regime of secular disk evolution ( e.g. , hohl 1975 ; combes & sanders 1981 ; combes et al .",
    "1990 ) , and thus one could perhaps argue for the use of barge light rather than bulge light , in the following section we have proceeded by performing a bulge@xmath6bar@xmath6disk decomposition , as done for the galaxies with supermassive black holes ( e.g. , lsker et al .  2014a ; savorgnan & graham 2015a , and references therein ) .",

    "of immediate note is the improved quality of the fit , evinced by the smaller residuals around the inner @xmath255@xmath58 and the reduced rms scatter ( figure  [ fig6 ] ) . with a major - axis , @xmath50-band half light radius equal to two - thirds of a kpc , the central component is neither an agn point source nor a star cluster but instead the bulge component of this galaxy .",

    "hubble space telescope _ images would be valuable for assessing the contribution / existence of any optical agn point source .",
    "a nuclear star cluster may also be expected , and the prescription in graham ( 2015b ) suggests that it would be a few million solar masses if associated with the black hole in leda  87300 , and thus it would have an @xmath50-band magnitude prior to dust extinction of @xmath65 mag ( assuming a stellar mass - to - light ratio of unity ) .",

    "<S> the mass scaling relation between supermassive black holes and their host spheroids has previously been described by a quadratic or steeper relation at low masses ( @xmath0 ) . </S>",

    "<S> modelled the bulge _ and _ bar as the single spheroidal component of this galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> here we perform a 3-component bulge@xmath6bar@xmath6disk decomposition and find a bulge luminosity which is 7.7 times fainter than the published ` bulge ' luminosity . after correcting for dust , we find that @xmath7 and @xmath8  which is now in accord with ratios typically found in scd  sm galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we go on to discuss slight revisions to the stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath9 km s@xmath10 ) and black hole mass ( @xmath11 ) and show that leda  87300 remains consistent with the @xmath4@xmath12 relation , and also the near - quadratic @xmath4@xmath13 relation when using the reduced bulge mass . </S>",
    "<S> leda  87300 therefore offers the first support for the rapid but regulated ( near - quadratic ) growth of black holes , relative to their host bulge / spheroid , extending into the domain of intermediate mass black holes . </S>"
