    "the mechanisms that precede the formation of a thermalized , locally deconfined plasma of quarks and gluons in relativistic nuclear collisions have recently attracted considerable interest , because it was noticed that the preequilibrium phase may influence the yield of certain quark - gluon plasma signals , such as lepton pairs and hadrons containing heavy quarks .",
    "the space - time evolution of quark and gluon distributions has been investigated in the framework of the parton cascade model @xcite .",
    "this model is based on the concept of the inside - outside cascade @xcite and evolves parton distributions by monte - carlo simulation of a relativistic transport equation involving lowest - order perturbative qcd scattering and parton fragmentation .",
    "numerical studies @xcite have shown that phase - space equilibration of partons occurs over a period of 1 - 2 fm/@xmath0 , and is initially dominated by gluon - induced processes .    from these investigations , and from more schematic considerations ,",
    "a picture involving three distinct stages of parton evolution has emerged @xcite :    \\(1 ) gluons `` thermalize '' very rapidly , reaching approximately isotropic momentum space distributions after a time of the order of 0.3 fm/@xmath0 .",
    "\\(2 ) full equilibration of the gluon phase space density takes considerably longer .",
    "\\(3 ) the evolution of quark distributions lags behind that of the gluons , because the relevant qcd cross sections are suppressed by a factor 2 - 3 .",
    "although this picture emerges from the numerical simulations of the parton cascade model @xcite , the complexity of these calculations makes it difficult to obtain a lucid understanding of the dependence of the different time scales on various parameters and model assumptions .",
    "it is the goal of our present investigation to derive this insight .    a second , equally important , motivation for our study was the desire to obtain a better physical understanding of the infrared cut - offs required in the parton cascade model .",
    "the two cut - off parameters employed in ref . [ 1 ] , the minimal transverse momentum transfer @xmath1 in binary parton interactions and the infrared cutoff @xmath2 in parton fragmentation processes , were determined by comparison with cross - sections and particle multiplicities measured in nucleon - nucleon interactions at high energies .",
    "these values are assumed to reflect the transition between the perturbative and nonperturbative regimes of qcd in the normal vacuum . on the other hand",
    ", it is well known that color screening provides a _ natural _ cut - off of long - range interactions in a deconfined qcd plasma @xcite , and no artificial cut - off parameters are required to obtain finite perturbative cross sections in a dense medium @xcite .",
    "a previous study @xcite has shown that screening effects may be sufficiently strong immediately after the primary parton collision events in nuclear collisions at rhic energies and beyond to provide the infrared cut - off required in the treatment of secondary parton interactions .",
    "improved understanding @xcite of the suppression of fragmentation processes in a dense qcd plasma ( landau - pomeranchuk effect ) has also allowed to regard the infrared cut - off @xmath2 as a medium - dependent effect in relativistic nuclear collisions .",
    "we show here how these medium effects can be utilized to obtain a parameter - free set of equations , based on perturbative qcd in a dense partonic medium , that describes the evolution of quark and gluon distributions towards equilibrium .",
    "arbitrary cut - off parameters enter only into the description of the primary semi - hard parton scattering , where one must continue to rely on a comparison with nucleon scattering data . after this short initial phase , however , the approach towards an equilibrated quark - gluon plasma will be described without need for arbitrary parameters .",
    "our paper is structured as follows : chapter ii discusses initial parton production in relativistic nuclear collisions .",
    "the evolution of these partons into locally isotropic , quasi - thermal momentum distributions is described in chapter iii . in chapter",
    "iv we derive a set of rate equations describing the further evolution and chemical equilibration of gluon and quark distributions .",
    "the influence of the dense medium on the relevant qcd cross sections is discussed in chapter v , and a closed set of rate equations including these medium modifications is derived .",
    "we explore the solution of these equations in chapter vi .",
    "some consequences for quark - gluon plasma signatures are briefly discussed in the conclusions .",
    "in high energy nucleon - nucleon collisions the production of minijets with @xmath3 about a few gev becomes increasingly important at colliding energies beyond the cern isr energy range @xcite .",
    "one would certainly expect that there could be a fairly large number of minijets produced in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisons .",
    "it was estimated by kajantie et al .",
    "@xcite that minijets could contribute up to half of the total transverse energy produced in heavy ion collisions at rhic energy . unlike the soft processes which dominate the reaction at lower energies , those minijets carry relatively large transverse momenta and they quickly become incoherent from the rest of nuclear matter in the fragmentation region . if a sufficiently high density is reached and the equilibration proceeds rapidly , those minijets would eventually lead to a thermalized and locally deconfined quark gluon plasma .    to estimate the initial parton density ,",
    "we calculate the minijet production using the hijing monte carlo model @xcite . in this model , perturbative qcd ,",
    "implemented along the lines of pythia @xcite , is combined together with low @xmath3 phenomenology to describe multiple minijet production in each binary nucleon - nucleon collision .",
    "one important quantity in the model is the inclusive jet cross section .",
    "given the parton structure function , @xmath4 and the perturbative parton - parton cross section @xmath5 , the differential jet cross section in nucleon - nucleon collisions can be calculated as @xcite @xmath6 where the phenomenological factor @xmath7 accounts for higher order corrections and @xmath8 are the feynman variables denoting the longitudinal momentum fraction carried by a parton . since this cross section diverges and the perturbative approach fails at small @xmath3 , we introduce an infrared cut - off @xmath1 to calculate the total inclusive jet cross section @xmath9 .",
    "introducing @xmath10 for the soft interactions below the cut - off , we _",
    "obtain _ the inelastic cross section for nucleon - nucleon collisions in the eikonal approximation @xcite , @xmath11 , \\label{2}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the partonic overlap function between two nucleons at impact parameter @xmath13 . in order to account for the shadowing of the parton density within a nucleus",
    ", we also introduced effective parton structure functions @xmath14 which include medium corrections @xcite .",
    "to fix the two correlated parameters @xmath1 and @xmath15 , we have assumed constant values of @xmath1 = 2 gev/@xmath0 and @xmath10 = 57 mb .",
    "the resultant total , elastic and inelastic cross sections agree very well with the experiments from isr to tevatron and cosmic - ray energies @xcite .",
    "we want to emphasize here that the infrared cut - off @xmath1 in the primary parton - parton scatterings is a phenomenological parameter and is constrained by the experimental values of the total nucleon - nucleon cross section .",
    "( as we will discuss below , this infrared singularity of parton cross sections in a dense partonic medium can be regulated naturally by the color screening mass . )    due to the high gluon density at small @xmath16 and the large gluon - gluon cross section , the initially produced partons are predominantly gluons .",
    "it is very important for the following discussion of the emergence of momentum isotropy that the @xmath3 distributions of the initially produced gluons are almost exponential .",
    "the results of the hijing calculation at rhic and lhc energies are given in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the rapidity width of the central plateau @xmath17 , the total number of the produced gluons @xmath18 , and their average transverse momentum @xmath19 are listed .",
    "before we estimate the initial parton number and energy densities , we next have to address the problem of thermalization .",
    "we can apply rate equations and particle distribution functions to describe the system only , when approximate local isotropy in momentum space is achieved . at the onset of expansion , scattered partons with very different rapidities are confined to a highly compressed slab . the width @xmath20",
    "@xmath21 = 0.2 fm of this slab is determined by the virtuality of the scattering partons , which in turn is connected with the transverse momentum cut - off @xmath1 for perturbative parton scattering .    at this point",
    "we adopt a realistic ansatz for the phase space distribution of the scattered gluonic partons . following ref .",
    "@xcite , we define the momentum distribution function as : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the transverse momentum and the rapidity of the gluons respectively , and @xmath25 is the color - spin degeneracy factor for gluons . parametrizing the hijing results @xmath26 can be represented by @xmath27 \\;\\;\\tilde g ( k_t),\\ ] ] where the function @xmath28 is explicitly given in ref .",
    "@xcite for au + au collisions at rhic and lhc energies . for the spatial part of the distribution function ,",
    "we assume that the partons form a homogeneous cylinder of length @xmath29 and radius @xmath30 .",
    "the phase space distribution function then factorizes : @xmath31 with @xmath32 given by @xmath33 the overall normalization @xmath34 yields gluon rapidity densities @xmath35 = 110 for rhic and @xmath35 = 810 for lhc .    by local isotropy in momentum space we mean that a parton located in the central region of the collision is surrounded by partons with different but isotropically distributed momenta .",
    "this parton does not interact with all the partons in the plasma , but only with those within a distance approximately equal to the parton mean free path .",
    "we can imagine a little box in the central region the size of the mean free path @xmath36 .",
    "the momentum of each particle in the box has components longitudinal and transverse to the beam , @xmath37 and @xmath38@xmath39 respectively .",
    "we say that local isotropy in momentum space is established when the variance @xmath40 of the longitudinal momentum distribution of partons in the box equals that of the transverse momentum distribution , @xmath41 .",
    "in the case of an exponential distribution we call the isotropic parton system ( approximately ) thermalized . the variance @xmath42",
    "is defined as @xmath43 at rhic energy we find @xmath44 gev/@xmath0 using the phase space distribution of ref .",
    "@xcite , the value at lhc energy is 1.76 gev/@xmath0 . for the mean free path @xmath36 of this initial phase",
    "we take @xcite : @xmath45 corresponding to @xmath46 fm ( rhic ) and @xmath36 = 0.25 fm ( lhc ) , assuming @xmath47 = 0.3 .",
    "as the system expands , mainly in the longitudinal direction , partons with longitudinal momentum will leave the central region and @xmath40 will decrease as a function of time . assuming that the system evolves",
    "approximately by free streaming , the longitudinal position of a parton depends on its rapidity and time @xmath48 here @xmath49 denotes time in the c.m .",
    "system and @xmath50 is the initial position of the parton along the beam axis @xmath51 .",
    "the phase space distribution @xmath52 depends accordingly on time , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a unit vector along the @xmath55-direction .",
    "now we can determine @xmath56 and @xmath42 as functions of time : @xmath57 where the @xmath16 integral is over @xmath58 , the volume of a tube of longitudinal length @xmath36 , centered at @xmath59 .",
    "we find that @xmath60 equals @xmath42 for @xmath61 = 0.31 fm/@xmath0 ( rhic ) and @xmath61 = 0.23 fm/@xmath0 ( lhc ) .",
    "for @xmath62 , there is local isotropy in momentum space and we will describe the system by thermal rate equations from then on .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the kinematic separation of partons with different rapidity establishes conditions required for the validity of continuum dynamics after a short time of the order of 0.3 fm/@xmath0 . at this time",
    "the momentum space distribution of partons is roughly isotropic locally and approximately exponential .",
    "since we are here primarily interested in the chemical equilibration of the parton gas , we shall assume that the parton distributions can be approximated by thermal phase space distributions with non - equilibrium fugacities @xmath63 : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the inverse temperature and @xmath66 is the four - velocity of the local comoving reference frame .",
    "the expression ( [ 16 ] ) is known as jttner distribution .",
    "when the parton fugacities @xmath63 are much less than unity as may happen during the early evolution of the parton system , we can neglect the quantum corrections in ( [ 16 ] ) and write the momentum distributions in the factorized form @xmath67    however , this introduces errors of the order of 40 percent , when the parton phase space distributions approach chemical equilibrium . as an example",
    ", we show the dependence of the screening length @xmath68 for static color - electric fields related to the square of the debye mass @xcite @xmath69 on the gluon fugacity @xmath70 in figure 1 .",
    "the solid line is the exact perturbative result for the jttner distribution ( [ 16 ] ) , the dotted line shows the boltzmann approximation ( [ 17 ] ) , and the dashed line shows the result obtained for the factorized bose distribution @xmath71 the dimensionless quantity @xmath72 drops from unity at @xmath73 to @xmath74 at @xmath75 . as can be seen the boltzmann distribution function ( [ 17 ] ) is a good approximation to the gluon phase space density at small @xmath76 values . for @xmath77 values",
    ", however , the approximation ( [ 19 ] ) applies , which we will adopt in most of the following calculations .",
    "similar , although smaller , violations of factorization occur in the gluon and quark densities and in the various reaction rates .",
    "in general , chemical rections among partons can be quite complicated because of the possibility of initial and final - state gluon radiation .",
    "multiple radiative emission processes have been investigated in the framework of numerical simulations of parton cascades @xcite .",
    "however , since radiation processes are considerably suppressed in a dense parton medium due to rescattering @xcite , we shall here consider only processes where a single additional gluon is radiated , such as @xmath78 . in order to permit approach to chemical equilibrium",
    ", the reverse process , i.e. gluon absorption , has to be included as well , which is easily achieved making use of detailed balance .",
    "closer inspection shows that gluon radiation is dominated by the process @xmath79 , because radiative processes involving quarks have substantially smaller cross sections in perturbative qcd , and quarks are considerably less abundant than gluons in the initial phase of the chemical evolution of the parton gas .",
    "here we are interested in understanding the basic mechanisms underlying the formation of a chemically equilibrated quark - gluon plasma , and the essential time - scales .",

    "@xcite one obtains an initial gluon fugacity @xmath183 , which is three times larger than the value discussed above . using this value we find a larger initial energy density and hence a longer lifetime of 2.5 fm/@xmath0 for the plasma at rhic ( see the dashed curve in fig .",
    "4 ) . a higher value of @xmath70 at @xmath61 can also result from rescattering of gluons during the `` free - streaming '' period between the end of initial semihard scattering and @xmath61 .",
    "indeed , the parton cascade simulations @xcite indicate a rapid increase of gluon density during this pre - thermal phase . we conclude that the validity of this scenario of quark - gluon plasma production by perturbative parton scattering is uncertain at rhic energies , but very likely in the lhc energy domain .    from our investigation",
    "emerges the following scenario of a nuclear collision at collider energies : within @xmath184 fm/@xmath0 a dense parton gas is produced at central rapidities , which can be described as a locally thermalized , but not chemically equilibrated quark - gluon pasma . in the fragmentation region , where the parton gas created by minijets is not sufficiently dense to screen color fields , strings and color ropes are formed @xcite , which decay by non - perturbative qcd processes on a time scale of about 1 fm/@xmath0 .",
    "these strings extend between the wounded nuclei and the surface of the parton plasma , penetrating up to a screening length determined by the actual debye mass .",
    "as in the bjorken scenario , the scaling expansion of the system can best be described by using the proper time @xmath102 and space - time rapidity @xmath185 variables . this scenario is schematically shown in fig . 5 , where the physically different space - time regions of the pre - thermal creation phase , the parton plasma , and the string - dominated phase are indicated .",
    "the main difference to the conventional bjorken scenario @xcite is the far shorter formation time in the central rapidity region , corresponding to a much higher initial temperature .",
    "the bjorken scenario , however , most probably applies to the fragmentation region , where the non - perturbative color ropes may also decay into a quark - gluon plasma . at the interface between the two regions",
    "a reheating of the parton plasma may occur by dissipation of field energy stored in the strings .",
    "the dissipation of field energy in a quark - gluon plasma was recently studied by eskola and gyulassy @xcite . at rhic energies , where the approach discussed here",
    "leads to a rather low initial density of partons , color flux tubes may still permeate the whole central region .",
    "this would result in multiple interactions between partons from minijet cascades and the soft component modeled by color strings or ropes .",
    "in addition , the temperature falls so rapidly that it is difficult to maintain thermal equilibrium by elastic two - body collisions among partons . at rhic energies the characteristic collision rate , given by the inverse mean free path @xmath186 , is comparable to the cooling rate @xmath187 . as discussed by the authors of ref . [ 38 ] , such a state would exhibit large viscosity effects which can substantially slow down the cooling rate of the qcd plasma .",
    "our results support the picture emerging from numerical simulations of parton cascades and simple estimates that the highly excited parton plasma created in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions is initially mainly a gluon plasma .",
    "our results have important implications for several experimental signals associated with quark - gluon plasma formation , as has been pointed out before @xcite : rapid gluon thermalization at a high initial temperature leads to a substantial thermal contribution to the total yield of charmed quarks .",
    "this increase comes on top of a substantial suppression of primary charm production by nuclear shadowing of gluon distributions in the central rapidity region .",
    "hence the unambiguous observation of this charm enhancement will require the comparative study of @xmath188 , @xmath189 , and @xmath190 collisions at the same center - of - mass energy .",
    "the lack of chemical equilibration in the quark and gluon densities , on the other hand , causes a severe depletion of the number of emitted lepton - pairs compared with the naive thermal estimate .",
    "the shift towards higher invariant masses of the steeply falling lepton - pair spectrum due to the larger initial temperature in the plasma can conceivably offset this suppression @xcite .",
    "reliable quantitative predictions for these experimental signatures require complete microscopic simulations of the parton cascade which include the medium modification of cross - section and effective masses discussed in this paper .",
    "as we have shown , these medium effects slow the chemical equilibration of the parton plasma down .",
    "how can the medium dependence of the parton cross sections be included in microscopic simulations ?",
    "since these calculations trace the full space - time evolution of parton densities , it would be straightforward to calculate the color screening length , as well as the effective medium - induced masses of collective gluon and quark modes ( plasmons and plasminos ) as function of time .",
    "these quantities could then be used as input parameters for the determination of medium - dependent scattering cross sections and branching rates .",
    "an unresolved issue remains in the medium - dependence of the lower cut - off @xmath1 used to regularize perturbative qcd cross sections , which was fixed at @xmath1 = 2 gev/@xmath0 in hijing and at a similar , but energy - dependent value in the parton cascade .",
    "one possible way of approach would be to identify an upper limit to the ( medium - dependent ) running qcd coupling constant , above which perturbative cross sections can not be used .",
    "this limit @xmath191 could be chosen such that it equals @xmath192 in vacuum ; but it would correspond to a different momentum cut - off , or even no cut - off at all , at high parton densities @xcite .    we would like to thank k. kinder - geiger for his careful reading of the manuscript and several helpful discussions on the parton cascade .",
    "this work was partially supported by the u.s .",
    "department of energy ( grant de - fg05 - 90er40592 ) and the n.c . supercomputing center .                              with the possible exception of processes sensitive to static color - magnetic interactions .",
    "although such interactions are believed to be screened at momenta below the order of @xmath193 , a consistent analytical theory of color - magnetic screening does not yet exist ."
