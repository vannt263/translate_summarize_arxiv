    "[ met ] are given as projected along the major and minor axis of the galaxy , respectively , accounting for the mean ellipticity of the galaxy at the location of each metallicity measurement .",
    "due to differences in the geometry of the galactic components , such a projection can not be correct for fields located too much off the axes onto which the projection is made , thus we have not used data from disc fields deviating from the target axis by angles more than about 20 degrees .",
    "the error bars of metallicities present both the direct measurement uncertainties and variations arising from the uncertainty of the distance to the galaxy , reddening etc ; see @xcite and @xcite for an estimate of these effects . to consider all the uncertainties of our model resulting from this",
    "rather vaguely known metallicity distribution , we have used in our calculations the whole allowed range of metallicities , presented with the grey area in fig .  [ met ] .",
    "before fitting any models to the observations it is essential to consider possible effects of dust extinction on the observed data . ignoring of dust effects may lead to substantially wrong estimates of the structure , luminosity , colour and the mass of the stellar components .",
    "accounting for the effects of intrinsic dust extinction , however , is a complicated task .",
    "fortunately , the andromeda is an intensely studied galaxy and its dust distribution has been revealed by surveys with _ iras _ , _ iso _ and _ spitzer _ satellites at a variety of far - infrared wavelengths .",
    "conversion of the infrared flux along each line - of - sight into absorption is far from trivial , even if we assume the flux to be proportional to the dust column density , and we know the absorption properties of the dust . also , the actual absorption along each line - of - sight strongly depends on the geometry of the stellar populations and the dust layer .",
    "the _ spitzer _",
    "telescope infrared view in @xcite reveals dust concentrated in several spiral segments in the disc region of the galaxy , peaking at about a dozen kiloparsecs from the centre .    relying on reddening measured from colour histograms of globular clusters in m31 halo by @xcite",
    ", we have assumed that the extinction law of m31 is similar to that of the galactic dust . to calculate the total absorption , we use optical depth estimates from the literature .",
    "@xcite constructed a sophisticated model to estimate face - on optical depth of the m31 dust on the basis of _ uv _ , optical and infrared luminosity , the latter relying on the _ iras _ measurements at 60@xmath14 m and 100@xmath14 m .",
    "they found the azimuthally averaged optical depth @xmath15 to be in the range of 0.71.6 at 214kpc from the centre .",
    "later on , @xcite added the _",
    "satellite measurements at 175@xmath14 m . by transferring the infrared emission into dust mass and the latter into optical depth",
    ", they reached an optical depth value close to that of @xcite .",
    "however , to correct optical luminosity profiles , the uncertainties are large , further increased by our limited knowledge about the 3-d distribution and clumpiness of the dust clouds . while in the disc region it is reasonable to consider dust",
    "being concentrated within a rather thin dust disc as a result of disc kinematics , in the central bulge regions the dust clouds are likely to move along more varied orbits . a spherical rather than discy distribution of dust is suggested also by the far - infrared images .",
    "unfortunately , accounting for the absorption by roughly spheroidally distributed dust is too uncertain , thus we have avoided using the data within about 2 kiloparsecs from the centre along the minor axis .",
    "the recovery of the major axis profiles turns out to be a much simpler task .",
    "we assumed the dust disc to be thin compared to the stellar disc , with its optical depth proportional to the infrared flux , and calculated the absorption along each line - of - sight .",
    "interestingly , the resultant absorption is rather insensitive to the assumptions about the dust disc thickness and face - on optical depth .",
    "the high inclination angle of the galaxy increases the effective optical depth of the dust disc so much that nearly all the optical signal coming from the other side of the dust layer become absorbed , and naturally all the light from the stars between us and the dust layer reaches us unaffected .",
    "thus in the case of a thin dust layer with respect to the stellar disc , along the major axis absorption is effectively grey , being about 0.75mag almost uniformly for _ u _ , _ b _ , _ v _ , _ r _ , _ i _ filters and for any optical depth within the range @xmath16 .",

    "@xcite have derived integral absorption value as a function of inclination angle statistically on the basis of over 10,000 galaxies . for the inclination angle of m31 ,",
    "the absorption is 0.750.85mag for the bulge and 0.60.65mag for the disc in _",
    "b_-filter , which matches well with our estimate of 0.75mag .",
    "a satisfactory fit to the measured luminosity distribution of m31 can be achieved with just one or two srsic profiles if only one - dimensional photometry , based on a single filter observations , is used ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the case of m31 ,",
    "much more information is available : multi - colour photometry along both major and minor axes , metallicity maps , kinematical data  a comprehensive model should attempt to fit all these observations",
    ". a better fit can be achieved by increasing the number of components , for example it has been revealed from the infrared maps of m31 that the dusty star - forming region actually consists of several rings with offset centres and inclination angles @xcite . however , the use of a large number of components would blur our vision about the structure and the origin of the galaxy , thus here we try to use a minimal number of components giving simultaneously a satisfactory fit to all collected data .",
    "while the classical galactic components of the bulge and the disc are clearly visually detectable , and their existence and structure can undoubtedly be confirmed by studying the morphology of the galaxy and the kinematics of the embedded stars , classification of the outer stars into distinct stellar components is much more complicated .",
    "the outer regions are of extremely low density and the foreground stars of the milky  way dominate in the observed fields .",
    "moreover , recent studies indicate the presence of a considerable non - relaxed substructure around m31 in the form of tidal streams and disrupted companions @xcite , the most prominent of which is the giant steam .",
    "several observational studies of distant fields along the minor axis have found evidence for the existence of stellar populations far beyond the bulge and the disc regions @xcite .",
    "the outermost regions seem to be dominated by a faint , diffuse , very extended metal poor halo , perhaps embedding most of the whole local group @xcite .",
    "we refer to this underlying population as the",
    " outer diffuse halo \" . between the radii from a few to about 25 kiloparsecs , recent studies suggest the presence of a dynamically warm but slowly rotating stellar population of stars with intermediate metallicity , which we designate as the  inner halo \" . note that the same region has been referred to as the  extended disc \" @xcite , the  spheroid \" @xcite and the  bulge \" @xcite , depending on the viewpoint .",
    "earlier , when no information about the underlying metal - poor population was available , this population was simply referred to as the  halo \" .",
    "we have not attempted to include the giant stream in our model .",
    "the giant stream stars lie slightly off the minor axis of the galaxy and thus do not contribute significantly to our luminosity and kinematics data , while its expected total mass and luminosity can safely be fitted within the uncertainties of our results .",
    "besides , our model can deal with axially symmetric stellar populations only . for similar reasons , we also neglect the suggested bar population and the elongated ( double ) nucleus of the galaxy .    for simplicity , in our model",
    "we ascribe a set of a chemical composition and a formation time and subsequently a metallicity , @xmath8s and colour indices homogeneously over each component . in reality , the parameters listed above are all , to some extent , radius - dependent .",
    "however , the usage of a superposition of several components enables to compensate for such a simplification and provides a fairly good fit to the actual observational data , as will be shown below and in paper  ii .      to construct a sufficiently flexible and consistent model , allowing to describe",
    "both the surface luminosity distribution of components and their dynamics , we start from a spatial density distribution law for individual components , which allows an easier fitting simultaneously for light distribution and kinematics .",
    "in such a model , the visible part of the galaxy is given as a superposition of its individual stellar components .",

    "[ eq1 ] , the srsic law and their structure parameters @xmath25 can be seen in @xcite .",

    "the angle between the plane of the galaxy and the plane of the sky is denoted by @xmath33 .",
    "the summation index @xmath34 designates four visible components .",
    "the model parameters @xmath17 , @xmath24 , @xmath20 and @xmath25 for the components were determined by a subsequent least - squares approximation process .",
    "first , we made a crude estimation of the population parameters .",
    "the purpose of this step is to avoid obviously non - physical parameters  relation ( [ eq2 ] ) is non - linear and fitting a model to the observations is not a straightforward procedure .",
    "next , a mathematically correct solution was found for each component .",
    "uncertainties of the model ( related to the coupling of parameters ) were estimated by using the partial second derivatives of the sum of the least - square differences @xcite .",
    "details of the least - squares approximation and the general modelling procedure were described by @xcite ; @xcite ; tempel ( in preparation ) .    the parameters of the model ( the axial ratio @xmath17 , the harmonic mean radius @xmath35 , the structural parameters @xmath25 , the dimensionless normalizing constants @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath36-luminosities ) are given in table  [ model_param ] .",
    "the key objective of considering chemical evolution here is to have an estimate for @xmath8s of the stellar components independently of their kinematics . in principle ,",
    "stellar @xmath8s can be treated as free parameters in dynamical galaxy models ; masses of galactic components are then determined by the best fit to the kinematical data . in reality , a high degree of degeneracy exists in such a fitting of the components , e.g. the disc mass can be raised if the dark halo mass is lowered .",
    "thus the use of @xmath8s , provided by chemical evolution models reduces the uncertainties arising from such degeneracy .    in our model ,",
    "galactic components are assumed to be homogeneous stellar populations .",
    "for this reason , in order to describe chemical evolution , we can use for each component a simple stellar population ( ssp ) evolution model . in ssps",
    ", stars are left to chemically evolve according to the observationally determined evolutionary tracks ( colour - magnitude diagrams ) .",
    "the population is formed of born - together stars of various masses ; the relative amount of stars of a given mass is determined by the given initial mass function ( imf ) .    note",
    "that unlike several other studies of both local and high - redshift galaxies where a single ssp model has been adopted for the whole galaxy , we use a separate ssp model for each component , thus the galaxy as a whole is modelled as a superposition of several ssps which is closer to the actual situation .",
    "a variety of ssp models have been developed elsewhere .",
    "we have chosen to rely on the up - to - date and much - tested model _",

    "we constrain the metallicity of each population according to the measurements described in section  [ metobs ] .",
    "we further constrain the models according to star formation history estimates from the literature .",
    "guided by @xcite and @xcite we suppose that the star formation , both in the bulge and in the disc , started 10 gigayears ago and lasted with constant intensity for four gigayears .",
    "in addition we pollute the disc with a younger generation of stars having formed during the last four gigayears . according to the observed coulours",
    ", we find the fraction of the younger population will be roughly 10% .",
    "also referring to @xcite , we set the star formation of the inner halo having taken place 812 gigayears ago and ascribe similar history to the outer halo .",
    "ssp models are also strongly dependent on the choice of the input imf . while being among the most important distribution functions in astrophysics , the imf , on the other hand is rather poorly known despite the large amount of work devoted to it . on the basis of the field",
    "star studies of the milky  way disc and star clusters , relatively narrow constraints on the imf have been imposed for stars of at least the solar mass ; much less is known about the low - mass end of the function . making the matters",
    "worse , there is no reason to assume that all stellar populations in all galaxies descend from identical imfs ; birth conditions may vary significantly with time and environment , thus in the studies of other galaxies it is important to consider the effect of possible deviations from the imf established for our own neighbourhood .",
    "we use the 4-segment imf by @xcite for population modelling , but also run the monte carlo simulations to calculate variations resulting from the provided imf uncertainties .     and @xmath37 colour indices and mass - to - light ratio @xmath38 at different metallicities and at different initial mass functions .",

    "the general ages of the bulge and disc stars suggest a similar formation history for these components , starting a few gigayears after the big bang and continuing over an extended period . the small additional younger population of stars , needed to achieve the somewhat bluer colours of the disc , are in agreement with a relatively recent merger event , perhaps with a structure which by now has been disrupted to become the giant stream .",
    "how unique is the developed model ? to some extent , and partly because of the limitations set by the assumptions of homogeneous populations with axial symmetry and avoidance of ring - like structures , the components of the model are degenerate . with suitably chosen structural parameters ,",
    "the spheroidal bulge and inner halo populations can compensate for each other .",
    "in fact , we can think of the bulge and the inner halo as a single component with a declining metallicity gradient towards outer radii .",

    "these estimates are based on the partial second derivatives of the sum of the least - square differences ( the second derivatives of the goodness - of - fit parameter , see @xcite , eq .",
    "these errors describe how accurately each model parameter is determined on the basis of the used observational data . for the outer halo , where the observed photometry was very uncertain , these estimates were quite large ( over 100% ) and we do not present them in table  [ table_chem ] .",
    "the presented errors describe the goodness of our final model , and they do not fully take into account the coupling of parameters .",
    "we have attempted to estimate the effect of all observational and methodological errors and uncertainties on our results .",
    "the dominant source for uncertainties comes from the estimations of the mass - to - light ratio , given by chemical evolution models .",
    "we have tried to combine all the available information on the photometry and metallicity of m31 and to use up - to - date evolution models of stellar populations to minimize these uncertainties .",
    "but at a critical glance , we are still left with masses and mass - to - light rations uncertain by a factor of 1030 per cent .",
