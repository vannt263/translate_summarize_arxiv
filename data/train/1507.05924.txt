    "( mgs ) are localized clusters of distributed energy resources ( ders ) and loads interfacing one or multiple buses via flexible power electronic interfaces , able to operate both in connected ( to the main grid ) or standalone mode @xcite .",
    "the future power grid is envisioned as interconnected mesh of mgs , enabling flexible operation and improving the efficiency @xcite .",
    "variety of practical mg applications have emerged , differing significantly in scope , size and in the demands for communication and signal processing support .",
    "the mg operation , especially in standalone mode @xcite , relies on advanced control mechanisms assisted by communication technologies .",
    "mg control is commonly based on a three - level hierarchy : primary , secondary and tertiary @xcite .",
    "the primary level provides fast control of the basic mg operation , such as bus voltage and/or frequency control based on predefined references .",
    "the secondary and tertiary levels provide slower control mechanisms for enhancing the power quality , by setting the references for the primary level and optimizing the mg operation in grid - connected mode .    the traditional design of primary control avoids use of communications , due to the fact that most of the existing communication standards ( particularly wireless ones ) , are not designed to support the machine - type control traffic in power grid applications , i.e. , are unable to guarantee high reliability and constant availability .",
    "hence , the primary control is traditionally designed in a distributed manner , where each unit uses only locally available measurements @xcite . on the other hand , recent works consider the use of the existing mg power equipment , i.e. , power electronics and power lines , as a means to exchange control messages @xcite .",
    "an obvious solution in this respect is to use power line communications ( plc ) @xcite .",
    "however , for the emerging mg applications , where the focus is on small , isolated and localized systems operating in standalone mode , plc might prove to be a cost - inefficient and overly complex solution .",
    "this paper presents a novel , inexpensive , reliable and low - bandwidth communication solution , designed specifically for mgs operating in standalone mode and implemented using only the existing power equipment .",
    "we refer to it as _ power talk _ , as it modulates information over the main bus of the mg through subtle deviations of the power supplied by each unit .",
    "in particular , power talk exploits the flexibility of the electronic inverters , which modulate the parameters of the primary loops that control the parameters of the common bus and in this way exchange information among the mg units .",
    "the availability / reliability of power talk matches the ones of the mg bus , circumvents the use of additional hardware and requires only software enhancements .",
    "power talk has been introduced in @xcite , through a simplistic dc mg system with two units in a one - way communication scenario .",
    "the focus of @xcite is on enabling reliable communication without precise knowledge of the system configuration and of the load ; it is shown that using a special input symbol in a role of a pilot transforms the mg bus into some of the well - studied channels .",
    "@xcite represents the unknown system configuration and load variations through a thevenin equivalent , whose parameters determine the channel state that can be estimated .",
    "this enables to design power talk constellations of an arbitrary order that perform optimally in terms of symbol error probability .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the power talk to scenarios with multiple units , in which each unit communicates with all other units in the system .",
    "the contributions can be summarized as follows :    * we develop and analyze power talk strategies both for time division multiple access ( tdma ) , where a single unit transmits at a time , and full duplex ( fd ) , where all units transmit and receive simultaneously . * we present the concepts of signaling and detection spaces , based on which we develop communication strategies . in particular , we design the signaling space by taking into account the control parameters that do not violate operational constraints of the mg",
    ". we then investigate the detection space , i.e. , the local set of voltages and currents that a unit can observe , based on which the demodulation is implemented .",
    "* we investigate simple protocol designs that deal with the problems of unknown system configuration and variable loads .",
    "these protocols rely on using training sequences that reset the detection space at each receiver and foster reliable communications over the mg .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : background ] introduces the core ideas and implementation of power talk in dc mgs .",
    "section [ basic ] illustrates the communication principles of power talk through two simple , but insightful examples .",
    "section [ generalcomm ] presents the general communication model of power talk in dc mg .",

    "finally , section [ con ] concludes the paper .",
    "fig .  [ mgcontcomm ] shows the primary control diagram of a unit @xmath0 that operates as a voltage source converter ( vsc ) and participates in the voltage regulation in the mg .",
    "the unit interfaces the common bus through power electronics that implements the inner current and voltage control loops .",
    "these loops are usually very fast ( of the order of khz ) , enforcing the output current @xmath1 and voltage @xmath2 to follow the predefined references , as shown on fig .",
    "[ mgcontcomm ] .",
    "the bus voltage reference @xmath2 that is fed to the inner voltage control loop of the unit @xmath0 is set according to the _ droop _ law @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the droop parameters , namely the reference voltage and the virtual resistance ( also referred to as droop slope ) , and @xmath1 is the output current .",
    "parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 are controllable ; in standalone mode their values are usually set to enable proportional power sharing based on the ratings of the units .",
    "the basic idea of power talk is to change @xmath4 and @xmath5 in a controlled manner , thereby inducing variations in the output voltage @xmath2 and current @xmath1 that can be detected by other units in the system , thus leading to information exchange , see fig .",
    "[ mgcontcomm ] .    in the following ,",
    "we list the assumptions used throughout the manuscript .",
    "our focus is on small dc mgs , where all units are connected to a single common bus through feeder lines with negligible resistances .",
    "this assumption is valid for localized , isolated systems , expected to operate frequently in standalone mode @xcite . for simplicity , we assume that vscs in the mg supply a collection of loads aggregated in a single , purely resistive load , denoted by @xmath6 , whose instantaneous value is denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "we note that same concepts can be used with minor modifications for mixture of loads , including constant power load .",
    "we consider all - to - all communication scenario in which the time is slotted , where vsc units in the system maintain slot synchronization .",
    "the slot duration @xmath8 complies with the control bandwidth of the inner control loops and allows the system to reach steady - state @xcite . in practice",
    "@xmath8 should be of the order of milliseconds .",
    "each vsc samples the voltage and the output current with frequency @xmath9 of the order of khz @xcite .",
    "power talk uses the averages of @xmath10 samples during a single slot , i.e. , all voltages and currents are averaged over slot duration @xmath8 with sampling frequency @xmath9 , see fig .",
    "[ mgcontcomm ] . finally , we consider only binary power talk and note that the developed techniques can be straightforwardly generalized to higher order modulations .    under the above assumptions , for general dc mg system with @xmath11 vscs and each of them using to regulate output voltage and current ,",
    "the common bus voltage @xmath12 in steady state is : @xmath13 where the approximation holds for negligible resistances of the feeder lines , @xmath14 .",
    "the output current from vsc  @xmath0 in steady state is : @xmath15 i.e. , the output currents @xmath1 from each vsc are determined by the bus voltage . therefore , the bus voltage @xmath12 is the only degree of freedom that could be used for power talk in dc mgs . alternatively , this can be represented through a single parameter that is the output power @xmath16 that vsc @xmath0 is supplying to the bus , leading to the term _",
    "power talk_.        finally , we note that all concepts , techniques and results presented in the paper were verified using plecs ( piecewise linear electrical circuit simulation ) simulator integrated with simulink in realistic mg settings .",
    "specifically , we use vsc units in boost converter topology , see fig .",

    "a simple and effective strategy for the construction of the detection space is to conduct a training phase during which the units input predefined training sequences .",
    "we assume that each unit builds its detection space separately , in order to take into account imperfections of the mg system , such as small resistances of the feeder lines and the common bus .",

    "talk , a unit has to learn 2 points in its detection space for each of the remaining units , see section  [ basic ] . assuming that a point is learned during @xmath30 dedicated slots , improves the reliability of the detection space construction , at a cost of an increased training phase . ]",
    "the training phase length is @xmath31 slots .",

    "a more involved approach would be to employ a model change detector that tracks the bus voltage and , if a change is detected , initiates the training phase . in further text",

    "we assume that the training phase occurs periodically after each vsc transmits @xmath41 bits of information .",
    "also , we assume the worst - case scenario in which each system state change completely `` destroys '' all detection spaces and all following transmissions are lost , see fig .",

    "each vsc can , in principle , locally track @xmath12 and @xmath1 and decide whether the system state has changed ; the state changes should be detected by all units simultaneously with high reliability .",
    "an option is to use a standard model change detector @xcite that tracks the voltage level .",
    "assume that each vsc implements such state change detector , operated it in the following way : i ) if a change is detected , then the current transmission is stopped , ii ) @xmath50 `` blank slots '' ( e.g. , nominal operation symbols @xmath51 ) are inserted by all units , to allow the system to reach steady state after the load change and , iii ) the training phase is re - initiated ; as illustrated in fig .",

    "the optimal choice of @xmath41 that maximizes @xmath56 , as function of @xmath11 and @xmath39 , is depicted in fig .",
    "we note that the depicted values of @xmath41 are obtained using numerical evaluation ; also , the fluctuations of @xmath57 in case of fd variant are due to the behavior of the optimal coding rate which is a step function of @xmath11 , see table  [ table1 ] . clearly , fd power talk implementation requires longer @xmath41 to maximize the rate , as it needs to compensate for the overhead of the training phase , i.e. , @xmath58 .",
    "thus , fd power talk is more suitable for longer data sequences when periodic training phase is used .",
    "[ eta_pii ] illustrates the net transmission rate per unit @xmath56 for power talk with load change tracker as function of @xmath39 .",
    "evidently , the fd power talk outperforms the tdma variant for load change intensities of practical interest , i.e. , small @xmath39 .",
    "however , tdma power talk achieves the asymptotic performance faster , which is also a consequence of the length of the training phases .",
    "[ etavsk ] compares fd and tdma power talks in terms of the achievable net transmission rates per unit , respectively , where the results in fig .",
    "[ etavsk ] are obtained for corresponding @xmath57 .",
    "evidently , @xmath56 decreases monotonically with @xmath11 , which could be expected .",
    "also , fd power talk is clearly a superior solution .",
    "as depicted , power talk with model change detector performs significantly better than periodic training strategy for both tdma- and fd - based solution ; the price to pay is increased implementation complexity and sensitivity to potential missed detections and false alarms , which are not included in the present study .",
    "further , for both protocols , the performance loss w.r.t .",
    "the stable operation , when @xmath47 , is larger for fd - based solution due to the longer training phase .",
    "this deviation becomes more apparent as the number of units @xmath11 increases , as well as for larger values of the load change intensity @xmath39 .",
    "it can be also observed that the gain of the fd - based solution over the tdma - based solution reduces with increasing @xmath11 and increasing @xmath39 . in principle , from the equations - , one can determine the values of @xmath11 for which @xmath59 , for given @xmath39 and @xmath41 .",
    "thus , it could be concluded that fd - based power talk is more efficient for systems with smaller number of units .",
    "we end the evaluation by reviewing the developed power talk protocols in the context of applications in which of a particular importance is the amount of information a single unit can obtain about the status of other units in the system .",
    "examples of such applications can be found in distributed control in mgs , average consensus and optimal dispatch .",
    "an appropriate metric to evaluate power talk in these applications is the net reception rate , defined as the average number of bits observed by a single unit per slot , denoted with @xmath60 and calculated as @xmath61 when the net transmission rates are equal .",
    "[ muvsk ] depicts @xmath60 for both protocol implementations .",
    "note that for tdma binary power talk the asymptotic upper bound for the net reception rate is 1 bit per unit per slot . for fd variant",
    ", @xmath60 is significantly larger and increases with @xmath11 ( although not monotonically , due to the coding rates , see table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "thus , fd - based power talk can provide significant benefits in mg applications in which information about the status of the rest of the system is necessary .",
    "in this paper we presented power talk , a novel concept tailored for communication among units in a microgrid .",
    "the core idea of power talk is to modulate information using primary control loops of the voltage source converters that regulate the bus voltage .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to design signaling constellations that conform to the operating constraints and limits to the power deviations with respect to the nominal operation .",
    "we have also shown that using map detector at the receiving side practically achieves errorless communication when the load ( i.e. , power demand ) is stable , under mild constraints on the number of units in the system and allowable power deviations .",
    "the main challenge of power talk is the arbitrary variations of load , leading to the uncontrollable and unforeseeable changes of the bus voltage .",
    "we investigated techniques to counter - effect load changes , showing that it is possible to optimize the power talk operation given the statistics of the load changes .",
    "the achievable rates of power talk depend on the bandwidth of the primary control loops . in practice",
    ", it could be expected that power talk can achieve rates of the order of @xmath62 . nevertheless , considering that the inter - mg communications are machine - type in nature",
    ", these modest rates may prove to be satisfactory .",
    "moreover , when assessing the potential of power talk , one should also take into account the inherent advantages of power talk , which are use of existing mg power equipment , software implementation , and reliability and availability equal to the reliability and availability of the mg itself .",
    "when scheduled to transmit , vsc @xmath0 transmits exactly @xmath63 bit of information in a single slot with probability @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the probability that the load changes during the slot , see section  [ protocols ] . under fair scheduling and in the absence of noise , the transmission rates are equal for all units .",
    "denote with @xmath66 the slot when the first change of the system state occurs .",
    "then , @xmath67 can be written as : @xmath68.\\ ] ] the last term corresponds to the case when no load change occurs during the data phase . using arithmetic - geometric progression to solve produces .",
    "with fd , we use chang - weldon uniquely decodable coding and decoding @xcite .",
    "the code for vsc @xmath0 contains only two codewords of length @xmath69 to represent each bit , with @xmath70 given in table ii .",
    "thus , when using fd solution , each unit has to send a block of bits of length @xmath69 correctly to be deliver 1 bit of information that can be uniquely decoded by other units .",
    "again , in absence of noise the transmission rates are equal for all units",
    ". denote with @xmath71 the block of bits of length @xmath69 when the first load change occurs .",
    "then , @xmath67 can be written as : @xmath72.\\ ] ] using arithmetic - geometric progression to solve , produces .",
    "the derivation is identical for both tdma- and fd - based power talk .",
    "the average number of slots , necessary to deliver @xmath41 bits of information depends on the number of state changes that occur during the transmission of @xmath41 bits . in absence of noise",
    ", the average number of slots , necessary to deliver @xmath41 bits is the same for all units and @xmath56 can be written as : @xmath73 and it does not depend on @xmath41 and @xmath74 is the average duration of the training phase , since the state can also change during the training .",
    "we also include the slot in which the state changed , since the bit in that slot will be retransmitted .",
    "to analyze @xmath74 we note that if a load change occurs in the training sequence , the training sequence is re initiated .",
    "then , we use the absorbing markov chain shown on fig .",
    "[ chain ] to model @xmath75 .",
    "the chain always starts from the state @xmath76 .",
    "the absorbing state is the state when the training sequence has been completely sent without interruptions .",
    "@xmath74 is actually the average number of transitions in the chain until absorption . for the chain shown of fig .",
