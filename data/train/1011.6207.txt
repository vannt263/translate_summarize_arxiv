    "several detection techniques exist in order to study the regular or chaotic behavior of orbits of hamiltonian systems .",
    "lyapunov_-like methods are based on the resolution of the so - called variational equations giving the evolution of deviation vectors associated to a given orbit .",
    "these are essentially the fli @xcite , megno @xcite , sali @xcite and gali @xcite methods . in @xcite",
    ", we have introduced the _ global symplectic integrator _ ( for short the gsi ) , a method allowing to solve both hamiltonian equations of motion and variational equations using a totally symplectic integration scheme .",
    "based on a comparison of the gsi with non - symplectic integration schemes , it was clearly shown that the gsi was more accurate in the detection of regular and chaotic orbits , using the sali chaos indicator , and less time - consuming than non - symplectic methods .",
    "such a kind of symplectic integration scheme for the variational equations has also been recently and independently proposed in @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to show that other chaos detection techniques , for instance the megno , can be used jointly with the gsi and their efficiency thus improved .",
    "the computation of the megno needs to study the time evolution of a single deviation vector .",
    "this advantage , with respect to the sali that needs the knowledge of the evolution of two deviation vectors , becomes critical when considering a large amount of orbits on long time spans .",
    "moreover , the use of the gsi does not rely on the use of a specific symplectic integrator scheme .",
    "hence , our second aim is to discuss and compare different symplectic integrators .",
    "it turns out that methods adapted to the structure of the hamiltonian equations of motion are not necessarily suited for the associated variational equations .",
    "while the study of the dynamics of two well - known hamiltonian systems , hnon - heiles and the restricted three - body problem , have been addressed in @xcite , we hereby propose to use the gsi to improve the detection of slow diffusion in hamiltonian systems , the so - called arnold diffusion , analyzed according to the model proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : gsi ]",
    ", we briefly summarize the gsi method , and we review two classes of symplectic integrators . section  [ sec : megno ] is devoted to the definition of the megno indicator and the algorithm used to compute it .",
    "an application to the arnold diffusion problem is then presented in section  [ sec : arndiff ] , for which the the gsi method is compared to a non - symplectic scheme .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : concl ] we sum up and draw our conclusions .",
    "let us consider an autonomous hamiltonian system with @xmath0 degrees of freedom @xmath1 where @xmath2 are the momenta and variables vectors .",
    "the hamiltonian vector field may be written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the standard symplectic matrix , being @xmath6 the @xmath7 identity matrix and @xmath8 the @xmath7 matrix whose entries are all zero .",
    "many chaos indicators like the fli @xcite , the megno @xcite , the sali @xcite and more recently the gali @xcite require the time evolution of deviation vectors to be computed .",
    "these vectors , @xmath9 , satisfy the variational equations given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the jacobian matrix of the vector field @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the hessian matrix of @xmath14 .    in @xcite",
    ", the gsi has been introduced to simultaneously integrate both systems of equations ( [ hvectfield ] ) and ( [ tm ] ) by means of a symplectic integrator .",
    "this method assumes that @xmath14 may be split into two separately integrable parts .",
    "for instance when @xmath15 the variational equations ( [ tm ] ) can be written as @xmath16 while the associated hamiltonian @xmath17 is expressed as @xmath18 the above introduced notations will be use throughout the paper .      in the present work ,",
    "two symplectic integrators have been tested .",
    "both are based on the campbell - baker - hausdorff ( cbh )  @xcite formula which ensures that one can find a general explicit integrator with @xmath19 steps of the form @xmath20 whose coefficients @xmath21 and @xmath22 have to be carefully chosen to get the required precision , i.e. reach the integrator order @xmath23 . integrating @xmath14 at order @xmath23",
    "means that we exactly evaluate @xmath24 where @xmath25    in @xcite , four classes of symmetric symplectic integrators have been presented : @xmath26 if @xmath27 is small enough , it is shown that one can find specific coefficients such that @xmath28 obviously , since the approximation error depends on the _ weight _ @xmath29 of the perturbation , these classes of integrators are not well suited for hamiltonian systems that are not perturbations of integrable ones .    in general , for the hamiltonian @xmath17 associated to variational equations ,",
    "the ratio @xmath30 is not necessarily small .",
    "hence , the method presented in @xcite is not suitable . to tackle this problem ,",
    "we have chosen to use another class of symmetric and explicit symplectic integrators presented in @xcite .",
    "the latter does not take into account the importance of the perturbation and can be defined starting from the basic bloc given by the second order strmer - verlet / leap frog scheme , @xmath31 , as follows : @xmath32 in this case , the error depends only on the time step @xmath33 , as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : interror ] ) .",
    "while this method turns out to be very efficient for the variational hamiltonian @xmath17 , it does not take advantage of the structure of @xmath34 as a perturbation of an integrable system .",
    "according to @xcite , the mean exponential growth factor of nearby orbits is defined as @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the euclidean norm of @xmath37 . a more useful and stable indicator is given by the mean megno , namely the time - average : @xmath38    while @xmath39 may not converge nor admit a limit for @xmath40 , it has been proven by  @xcite that the asymptotic value of @xmath41 provides a good characterization of the regular or chaotic nature of orbits . basically , @xmath42 for quasi - periodic orbits on an irrational torus for a non - isochronous system and for orbits close to stable periodic ones . in the limit case where the orbit coincides with a stable periodic orbit",
    ", @xmath43 asymptotically reaches zero . considering irregular orbits",
    ", @xmath44 increases linearly with time , being the slope half of the first lyapunov exponent .      the computation of the megno and its time - average requires both integrals ( [ megno ] ) and ( [ meanmegno ] ) to be solved accurately .",
    "different methods are available .",
    "a straightforward approach is based on the introduction of two auxiliary functions @xmath45 and @xmath46 such that @xmath47 whose time evolution is directly given by the following differential equations : @xmath48 obviously , ( [ tm ] ) and ( [ vw2 ] ) have to be computed with the same integrator ( see e.g. @xcite,@xcite , @xcite ) . in this case , the time step used to integrate eq .",
    "( [ tm ] ) is fixed by the integration of eq .",
    "( [ vw2 ] ) . however , the use of auxiliary functions is less efficient within a symplectic integration scheme ( in fact , ( [ vw2 ] ) are not generally hamiltonian equations ) .",
    "indeed , it is well - known that symplectic integrators show very good energy conservation properties , allowing us to consider larger step sizes and limit energy loss . in light of these considerations ,",
    "other alternatives have been studied .    in particular , using the definition of the megno for discrete time dynamical systems ( i.e. maps ) given by  @xcite , it has been proposed in  @xcite to compute @xmath39 and @xmath49 by observing that a fixed step size integrator can be considered as equivalent to a discrete time map .",
    "hence @xmath50}}(t+h ) = \\frac{t}{t+h } y_{\\text{\\tiny [ breiter et al . , 2005]}}(t)+2\\ln \\frac{\\delta(t+h)}{\\delta(t ) } \\quad\\text{and } \\notag \\\\ \\bar{y}_{\\text{\\tiny [ breiter et al . , 2005]}}(t+h )",

    "let us note that these formulas can be obtained by using a simple rectangular quadrature method to solve both integrals ( [ megno ] ) and ( [ meanmegno ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , a mixed scheme has been proposed in  @xcite , that relies on the computation of the megno by using the so - called trapezoidal rule   and an interval @xmath52 $ ] , one has  @xcite @xmath53 + \\mathcal   o((b - a)^3f'')\\ , , \\label{trap}\\]]the second derivative being estimated on the interval @xmath52 $ ] . ] to compute the integral in the definition  ( [ megno ] ) and then the discrete time approximation for the mean megno .    in the present work ,",
    "we develop further this idea : we propose to use the trapezoidal rule to compute both integrals ( [ megno ] ) and  ( [ meanmegno ] ) .",
    "first , we rewrite  ( [ megno ] ) as @xmath54 then using the trapezoidal rule we get @xmath55 and @xmath56+\\mathcal o(h^3)\\ , .",
    "\\label{meanmegnoquad } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let us observe that the above formulas ( [ megnoquad ] ) and ( [ meanmegnoquad ] ) improve the aforementioned ones corresponding to lower order approximations of the integrals defining megno and mean megno .    in the following , eq .",
    "( [ megnoquad ] ) and ( [ meanmegnoquad ] ) will be used to compute the megno whenever we use a symplectic scheme , whereas eq .",
    "( [ vw2 ] ) will be used with rk4 .",
    "let us note that in the rest of the paper we will be interested in asymptotic values of mean megno i.e. mean megno values at the end of the integration process . in order not to introduce any bias in the computation of the megno and mean megno , initial deviation vectors @xmath57",
    "will always be randomly chosen with uniform probability in the appropriate hypersphere .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the gsi proves to be more efficient than non - symplectic schemes to correctly identify the behavior of a given orbit especially on dynamics acting on long time scales . in this section",
    ", we will show that this is particularly relevant in case of slow chaotic diffusion . to that purpose",
    ", we decided to consider the following hamiltonian system described in @xcite : @xmath58 where actions @xmath59 and angles @xmath60 are canonically conjugate variables and @xmath61 is assumed to be a small parameter .",
    "given the structure of ( [ harnold ] ) , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "hence , each straight line @xmath65 on the two - dimensional plane @xmath66 represents a resonance .    as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ phasespace ] , most relevant resonances are clearly visible on the plane @xmath66 , to form the so - called _",
    "arnold web_. mean megno values are shown for a grid of @xmath67 equally spaced initial conditions in this plane .",
    "other initial conditions are @xmath68 and @xmath69 , and the parameter @xmath61 has been fixed to @xmath70 , as in the rest of this work .",
    "this value needs to be small in order to avoid resonances overlap .",
    "besides , as pointed out in @xcite , the smaller the perturbation , the slower the diffusion .",
    "the gsi has been used with @xmath71 integrator with a fixed time step @xmath72 and an integration time of @xmath73 .",
    "the dashed line highlights the @xmath74 resonance .",
    "this web of resonances is of particular interest .",
    "indeed , it has been proven ( see @xcite ) that arnold diffusion exists along resonances . moreover , in @xcite , a numerical proof of diffusion along resonances for this model is given .    the analysis presented in section [ arnoldanalysis ]",
    "will be performed in the region delimited by @xmath75 and @xmath76 , centered on the @xmath74 resonance .",
    "this small region is enclosed in the box shown in fig .",
    "[ phasespace ] .",
    "an enlargement of this box is presented in fig .",
    "[ phasespacebox ] .",
    "again , a grid of @xmath67 equally spaced initial conditions has been numerically integrated using the gsi with @xmath71 integrator up to @xmath73 time units .",
    "other initial conditions and parameters are the same as the ones used to produce fig .",
    "[ phasespace ] . in the following analysis",
    ", we will consider several orbits around the top hyperbolic border ( in brown in fig .",
    "[ phasespacebox ] ) of the resonance where diffusion is actually confined .      in this section",
    ", we will compare the results on the correct determination of regular or chaotic orbits behavior obtained with the gsi and a non - symplectic scheme . through an analysis of the maximum relative errors on the energy , percentage of correctly identified orbits and cpu time",
    ", we will show that our symplectic scheme outperforms the non - symplectic one in the determination of the behavior of orbits .",
    "as it is necessary to consider long integration times and a lot of different initial conditions , it has been decided to use and compare fourth - order integrators .",
    "in fact , this turns out to be a good compromise between reliability of the numerical results , as measured in term of relative energy loss , and number of evaluations of the vector fields , translated easily into required cpu time . on the one hand , we considered the well - known non - symplectic fourth - order runge kutta ( rk4 ) integrator .",
    "while it is simple to implement , it is also robust and efficient . on the other hand ,",
    "both symplectic integrators presented in section [ sectionint ] have been tested . as far as only the hamiltonian system ( [ harnold ] ) is concerned , saba and sbab integrator classes outperform yoshida integrator .",
    "indeed , given that @xmath61 is small , this system can be seen as a perturbation of an integrable system .",
    "hence , the error ( [ eq : interrorpert ] ) is smaller than yoshida s one ( [ eq : interror ] ) .",
    "however , saba and sbab classes performances become rapidly poor for the hamiltonian system @xmath77 associated to the variational equations .",
    "it is mainly due to the structure of @xmath78 . as time increases ,",
    "the weight of the @xmath79 part , say the perturbation , of the hamiltonian @xmath80 may become larger than the @xmath81 part , or vice versa without any possible control , see fig .",
    "[ perturbation ] .",
    "this implies that the error on the energy increases too .",
    "fortunately , yoshida integrators do not depend on this kind of consideration and are then more suited for this application . as already stated in section [ sectionint ] , yoshida integrators do not take advantage of the structure of @xmath82 but it is conversely useful for the integration of variational equations .",
    "hence , for the purpose of the present study , it has been decided to compare rk4 integrator to @xmath83 and @xmath71 .",
    "the comparison has been performed considering @xmath84 orbits whose initial conditions ( @xmath85 ) are uniformly distributed around the top hyperbolic border of the resonance ( the parallelogram in fig .",
    "[ phasespacebox ] ) .",
    "first , for each one of these orbits , a _ reference _ value of the mean megno has been computed with @xmath71 , a time step equal to @xmath72 and an integration time of @xmath86 . afterwards , for time steps between @xmath87 and @xmath88 , the same orbits have been numerically integrated with both methods ( the gsi and the non - symplectic scheme ) in order to obtain the corresponding megno values .",
    "eventually , a comparison with the _ reference _ megno values has been done , enabling us to classify orbits as correctly identified or not .",
    "at the same time , cpu times and maximum relative errors in energy have been stored . in order to reduce numerical truncation errors ,",
    "it has been decided to achieve this study using quadruple precision .",
    "a relevant indicator to test the goodness of the numerical integration , is to compare the maximum relative errors in energy @xmath89 @xmath90 being the energy , i.e. the value of the hamilton function , at time @xmath91 on the @xmath92th orbit .",
    "a second important indicator , related to the speed of the integration algorithm , is the cpu time @xmath93 @xmath94 being the cpu time needed to integrate the @xmath92th orbit and the associated deviation vector on the defined time span .",
    "both indicators are reported in fig .",
    "[ energy ] as functions of the time step for the different integrators .",
    "it appears that @xmath71 shows always smaller energy loss than rk4 integrator .",
    "moreover , as time step increases , this difference becomes larger too .",
    "also note that the maximum error becomes larger with rk4 than with @xmath83 beyond @xmath95 .",
    "that means that , even if @xmath83 is only a second order integrator , it is more reliable than rk4 when using big time steps .",
    "another advantage of the gsi is the relatively low required cpu time ( @xmath96 ) in comparison to rk4 .",
    "this is particularly important as we are considering lots of different initial conditions and long integration times .",
    "obviously , the lower - order @xmath83 asks less cpu time than @xmath71 .",
    "moreover , the gsi correctly identifies more orbits than rk4 as time steps increase ( see fig .",
    "[ perc1 ] ) .",
    "indeed , mean megno values computed by means of rk4 are wrong for regular orbits when the time step is greater than @xmath97 .",
    "the percentage of well identified regular orbits even reaches zero while , at the same time , @xmath71 is still beyond @xmath98 .",
    "this difference is less discernible for chaotic orbits , since a small drift from the orbit and/or tangent direction does not lead to completely different behaviors .",
    "however , in the following , we will use the total percentage , @xmath99 , that presents a summary of both results .",
    "eventually , let us point out that the lower - order @xmath83 integrator manages to identify correctly approximately the same percentage of orbits as @xmath71 .",
    "eventually , all these observations can be recombined into a single efficiency index . as introduced in @xcite",
    ", @xmath100 enables us to quantify the _ efficiency _ of each method .",
    "the larger @xmath101 , the better the method . on the one hand",
    ", the percentage of correctly identified orbits must be as big as possible .",
    "on the other hand , relative error in energy ( @xmath102 $ ] ) and cpu time must remain low .",
    "the evolution of @xmath101 with respect to time step is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : index ] .",
    "it turns out that this index presents larger values for computations realized with the gsi , coupled to @xmath71 .",
    "it results obviously from previous considerations .",
    "for relatively small times steps ( @xmath103 ) , the non - symplectic scheme ( rk4 ) behaves similarly to the gsi .",
    "after that , this method is quickly penalized by its energy loss and lower percentage of well identified orbits .",
    "eventually , efficiency index for the gsi used with @xmath83 presents similar behavior to the ones of @xmath71 but on a lower level .",
    "it comes directly from its larger maximum relative error in energy .",
    "however , at time step @xmath104 , the gsi with @xmath83 becomes more efficient than the non - symplectic method , due to the joint effect of better energy conservation and number of correctly estimated orbits .",
    "let us observe that the same analysis has been performed in double precision .",
    "results concerning the percentage of correctly identified orbits are exactly the same .",
    "obviously , cpu times are proportionally smaller than the present ones .",
    "the main difference occurs with the evolution of maximum relative energy errors with respect to time step which are not perfect straight lines anymore .",
    "in particular , numerical truncation errors appear for too small relative errors in energy .",
    "this leads to an inaccurate efficiency index .",
    "in this work , we have shown that the gsi is a powerful tool to characterize the regular or chaotic behavior of orbits in hamiltonian systems .",
    "it proves to be especially efficient for dynamics acting on long time scales like the arnold diffusion problem analyzed here , as energy conservation properties of symplectic integration schemes are fully pointed up .    as it only asks for the knowledge of a single deviation vector ,",
    "the megno indicator is less time consuming than other chaos indicators and should be used jointly with the gsi . to numerically compute both megno and mean megno",
    ", we have introduced a quadrature method based on the trapezoidal rule .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that a particular attention has to be paid to the choice of the symplectic integrator .",
    "one has to bear in mind that both hamiltonian systems associated to the equations of motion and the variational equations can present very different structures . for this reason , we argue for the use of yoshida s symplectic integrator .",
    "finally , our analysis shows that the gsi outperforms non - symplectic schemes .",
    "indeed , large time steps are allowed , smaller computation times are needed and the energy loss is more limited .",
    "for all these considerations , we claim that the gsi method with the megno indicator and yoshida integrator turns out to be a reliable and time sparing method to correctly determine the behavior of orbits associated to hamiltonian systems .",
