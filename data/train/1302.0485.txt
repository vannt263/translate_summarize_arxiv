    "as well recognized , the hadron colliders are machines for discovery . on other aspects ,",
    "the electron - positron collider , muon - collider and even the proposed photon collider will provide detailed information about the discovered new physics candidates .",
    "once some peculiar phenomena are observed at the hadron colliders such as tevatron or lhc beyond the expectation of the standard model ( sm ) , one is tempted to associate them to new physics . generally , making conformation is difficult , especially there are too many models about the new physics available and most of them can offer a plausible interpretation towards the new observation .",
    "one of the reasons is that by the data obtained at hadron colliders , it is difficult to study the details which are crucial for identifying the new interaction and/or new particles observed in the physical process accompanied by an enormous background .",
    "that is why people will turn to invoke high - energy lepton colliders after successful operation of hadron colliders , especially electron - positron colliders which are more favorable because the technique for building such machines are more mature .",
    "to discover new physics , one is looking for phenomena beyond the sm expectation through experimental measurements carried at hadron colliders . confirming or at least claiming existence of new physics needs to measure several characteristic quantities which do not meet the sm predictions .",
    "the forward - backward asymmetry ( @xmath0 ) in top - antitop production at tevatron is one of such measurements .",
    "it is defined as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the angle between the outgoing top quark and the injecting proton beam and @xmath8 is the number of top quarks .    the data of tevatron at the fermilab observed a large @xmath0@xcite .",
    "the measurements of the cdf and d0 collaborations yield @xmath9@xcite , @xmath10@xcite and @xmath11@xcite , which are significantly larger than the sm prediction @xmath12@xcite .",
    "this discrepancy would compose a hint of existence of new physics beyond sm .",
    "numerous models beyond sm have been proposed to explain the deviation from the sm prediction , and we list a few of them in our references as examples @xcite .",
    "we also showed @xcite that the deviation of the theoretical prediction and the data can be mended in the little higgs model ( lhm ) .",
    "definitely , as commonly conjectured , since top quark is much heavier than rest members of quark families , its mass could be close to the scale of new physics , so that observation on processes associated with top quark should be more favorable for discovering new physics .",
    "however , on another aspect , it is also proposed to observe the @xmath0 in @xmath4 production@xcite . indeed ,",
    "comparing the asymmetries for top ( @xmath13 ) and bottom ( @xmath14 ) productions would be interesting .",
    "if the new physics beyond sm indeed contributes to the @xmath0 , and the scale of new physics is high and close to the top quark , then the new physics should make a larger contribution to @xmath0 in @xmath3 production than in @xmath4 production .",
    "namely , if we calculate the @xmath0 within the framework of only sm , the theoretical prediction on the @xmath0 for bottom should be closer to the data than for top .",
    "this general analysis might be violated due to so far unknown behaviors of new physics bsm .",
    "indeed all depends on the scales of new physics ( see below in the context ) .    in this work",
    ", we study the @xmath0 at @xmath15 colliders within the framework of sm and lhm which is one of the models beyond sm . for a proposed z factory",
    "the process under consideration is only @xmath16 because of the constraint of the phase space , while at ilc both the processes @xmath17 and @xmath16 would be accounted .    by a direct observation , the @xmath0",
    "is induced by the odd power of @xmath18 in the amplitude square .",
    "obviously , such terms imply parity in the process is violated ( pv ) . in the sm , the parity violation in the process",
    "@xmath16 is due to @xmath19 boson exchange , whose interaction with fermions has both vector and axial vector components . for next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , the box diagrams also generate the asymmetry , because it is equivalent to a t - channel tree diagram , thus lead to odd powers of @xmath18 .",
    "similar to the case of @xmath20 collision at tevatron , the production angle @xmath7 at the @xmath15 collider is defined as the angle between the outgoing bottom or top quark and the incoming electron beam .",
    "the difference of the rapidities of the @xmath21 and @xmath22 which is lorentz invariant is written in the @xmath15 center - of - mass frame as @xmath23 where @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 being the momenta of @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "obviously , the sign of @xmath29 is the same as @xmath18 , the asymmetry in eq.([afb ] ) which is experimentally measurable , can be recast as @xmath30    the @xmath4 asymmetry @xmath14 was theoretically predicted with the sm as @xmath31 @xcite and experimentally measured value at lepi is @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "there indeed exists an observable distinction between the prediction and data .",
    "moreover , the theoretical estimate did not involve the higher order corrections and interference with the photon contribution , when such corrections are taken into account , the situation becomes even worse , namely the theoretical prediction gets larger above the data ( see the details in next sections ) .",
    "it implies that new physics beyond the standard model whose contribution to the asymmetry destructively interferes with that of sm is needed to reduce the value . combining with the observation about @xmath0 at tevatron where the sm prediction is also apart from the data",
    ", we would take this deviation as a hint of existence of new physics bsm .",
    "of course the distinction might be due to the measurement errors , but one can not exclude a possible contribution from new physics beyond sm .",
    "the strategy of this work is to investigate the contributions of both sm and bsm to the asymmetries in @xmath33 and @xmath1 with a special bsm , i.e. the lhm which we used to explain the @xmath13 observed at tevatron .",
    "the energies we set are that of the z - factory and ilc ( or clic ) respectively .",
    "then we compare the asymmetries obtained for @xmath3 and @xmath4 to investigate their differences .",
    "even though we employ a special model bsm , the obtained results can make sense about the role of bsm for the asymmetries .",
    "it is noted that there is an obvious difference in the two cases , even though we employ the same model : lhm . for the tevatron case ,",
    "the main contribution is from an exchange of the heavy @xmath34 boson @xmath35 whose mass is generally believed to be around 400 to 500 gev , whereas for the lep cases , the main contribution comes from the heavy photon @xmath36 whose mass is within a range of a few tens of gev to 100 gev",
    ".    the future experiments will provide us more definite information .",
    "especially , a comparison of theoretical predictions and the data for both tevatron and @xmath15 collider may tell us consistency degree of the model and enrich our understanding of the nature , namely help us to search for new physics .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "after this introduction , in section ii , we formulate the total scattering cross section as well as @xmath0 to nlo within the frameworks of sm and lhm .",
    "the numerical results along with all the input parameters are shown in section iii .",
    "the obtained results are shown explicitly in several figures and tables , as possible interpretations on those curves are made .",
    "the last section is devoted to a simple discussion and conclusion .",
    "in this section we formulate the contributions up to nlo to the @xmath0 and total cross section of the @xmath37 system in the frameworks of sm and lhm .",
    "the derivation in sm is standard and straightforward , here we just repeat the calculation which was done by number of authors to check our programs .",
    "then we turn to the contribution of new physics , concretely the lhm .    in lhm@xcite only two vector bosons @xmath36 and @xmath35 can contribute asymmetry through s - channel .",
