    "thermal convection of a boussinesq fluid in a rotating sphere is a classical problem in fluid dynamics that has important implications for the heat transfer and generation of magnetic fields in astrophysical bodies . in the liquid core of planets ,",
    "the ekman number , @xmath8 , which measures the viscous effects compared with the coriolis force , and the rossby number , @xmath9 , which measures the nonlinear inertial effects compared with the coriolis force , are very small , so convection is strongly influenced by the global rotation .",
    "the linear onset of thermal convection in spherical geometry for @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 is the prandtl number , the ratio of the kinematic viscosity to thermal diffusivity of the fluid ) is now well understood following the theoretical work of @xcite , confirmed by experimental studies @xcite and numerical models @xcite . at the linear onset , the thermal instability takes the form of columnar flows aligned with the rotation axis , whose axial vorticity has much smaller variations along the rotation axis than in the azimuthal and cylindrical radial directions to accommodate the proudman - taylor theorem . these convective columns drift in the azimuthal direction , analogously to rossby waves , and are therefore called thermal rossby waves .    the properties of nonlinear convection for small @xmath8 and @xmath9 have received considerable attention but are still not fully understood ( e.g.  @xcite for a review ) . at the onset of instability , any infinitesimal perturbation grows exponentially until nonlinear effects saturate the growing solution .",
    "if the transition from the basic conduction state to the convection state is continuous , then we have a supercritical branch of convection ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    ". however , in some classical problems of fluid dynamics , the nonlinearities can promote the instability rather than saturating it .",
    "this leads to a subcritical bifurcation , meaning that , once the instability develops above the linear onset , it might continue to exist when the controlling parameter is decreased below the critical value for linear instability .",
    "subcritical behaviour has been observed in various convective systems such as double - diffusive convection ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , planar convection with moderate rotation @xcite , and bnard - marangoni convection ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in thermal convection in rotating spherical geometry ,",
    "weakly nonlinear analyses show that the nature of the bifurcation from the basic conduction state to the thermal rossby waves might change from supercritical to subcritical in the limit of small ekman numbers , at least in the case of internal heating @xcite",
    ". however , nonlinear numerical models , which can be computed down to @xmath13 , always find that the bifurcation is supercritical ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this possibly means that the numerical models are not run at sufficiently small ekman numbers to properly capture the properties of nonlinear convection for planetary cores ( where @xmath14 ) , even near the onset of convection .",
    "current numerical models might thus misrepresent realistic planetary convection for more vigorous thermal driving as well .",
    "the scaling laws for the global properties of convection that are derived from the numerical models ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would then not be applicable for natural objects .",
    "furthermore , calculations are generally performed for prandtl numbers close to unity while liquid metals have smaller @xmath12 ; for instance , the liquid iron in the earth s core is thought to have @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "subcriticality is observed for small prandtl numbers in planar convection with moderate rotation @xcite , and the value of @xmath12 might be equally significant for the nature of the bifurcation at onset in rapidly - rotating spherical convection .",
    "the objective of the present paper is to describe nonlinear convection for @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath16 near the onset . in order to map the different hydrodynamical regimes , we carry out an extensive exploration of the parameter space . to alleviate part of the computational limitations that apply to global models of planetary cores , we use the quasi - geostrophic ( qg ) approximation that was developed by @xcite for thermal convection in the annulus geometry of @xcite with curved boundaries , and",
    "subsequently used and modified for the spherical geometry by @xcite .",
    "the model assumes that the flow is geostrophically balanced , i.e.  the coriolis force balances the pressure gradient at leading order . by neglecting the variation of the axial vorticity along the rotation axis , we can model the flow in two dimensions .",
    "this is an important limitation to the full dynamics of rotating convection , but this exploratory study aims to inform future three - dimensional studies .",
    "the qg approximation allows us to model thermal convection for ekman numbers as low as @xmath2 .",
    "results from the numerical implementation of the qg approximation in spherical geometry have been successfully benchmarked against the asymptotic theory @xcite and 3d numerical models @xcite for the onset of convection , and against laboratory experiments in rotating convection @xcite and in shear flows @xcite for the nonlinear regime .",
    "the main issue of the qg approximation for rotating spherical convection is that the basic temperature background has a spherical symmetry .",
    "treating the temperature as a 2d field is therefore an unjustified approximation , although it has been successfully used in previous studies when compared with results from 3d models and laboratory experiments @xcite . in the present study",
    ", we follow the work of @xcite by coupling the 2d velocity to a 3d implementation of the temperature in the whole sphere .",
    "the coupling terms require interpolations from the 2d and 3d grids .",
    "the hybrid qg-3d approach can therefore only be efficient , in term of the computational time , if the temperature is solved on a 3d grid that is coarser than the 2d grid used for the velocity .",
    "this is particularly appropriate to model fluids with small prandtl numbers , where the dissipative scale of the temperature is larger than the viscous dissipation scale .",
    "recent studies of rapidly - rotating convection in small prandtl number fluids have shown that the prandtl number has a significant influence on the convection , especially on the dominant length and time scales of the flow @xcite . in this paper , we vary @xmath12 between @xmath17 $ ] . note that for small prandtl numbers , convection cells attached to the equator of the outer sphere are preferred to thermal rossby waves at the linear onset of convection when the ekman number is moderately small @xcite . in the limit @xmath10 and @xmath11 ,",
    "the critical rayleigh number at the onset of these equatorially - attached modes scales as @xmath18 , while the critical rayleigh number at the onset of the thermal rossby waves scales as @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the equatorially - attached modes are therefore unlikely to occur in the earth s core .",
    "the 3d numerical simulations of @xcite show that the thermal rossby waves are preferred for @xmath20 when @xmath7 and @xmath21 when @xmath5 .",
    "the equatorially - attached modes are outside the scope of this paper , so we restrict our study to this range of small ekman numbers .    for simplicity , we consider only thermal convection in a full sphere without a solid inner core to avoid the singularity of the qg approach at the tangent cylinder .",
    "consequently , the thermal convection is driven by an homogenous internal heating , which is a well - studied variation of the classical problem of thermal convection in a rapidly - rotating sphere @xcite , and is relevant for the early history of the earth s core ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows .",
    "first , we derive the formulation of the hybrid qg-3d model that describes thermal convection in a rapidly rotating sphere in  [ sec : model ] .",
    "then in  [ sec : nl ] , we discuss the results from the nonlinear simulations carried out near the onset for small ekman numbers .",
    "subcritical convection , hysteresis and nonlinear oscillations are reported .",
    "a discussion of the results is given in ",
    "[ sec : ccl ] . in appendix",
    "[ sec : linear ] , the results at the linear onset of convection obtained with our hybrid model are compared with results from the asymptotic theory and from previous quasi - geostrophic and 3d numerical models .",
    "we study thermal boussinesq convection in a rotating sphere driven by internal heating .",
    "the system rotates at a constant angular velocity .",
    "the acceleration due to gravity is radial and linear , .",
    "the radius of the sphere is @xmath22 and no inner core is present .",
    "the fluid has kinematic viscosity @xmath23 , thermal diffusivity @xmath24 , density @xmath25 , heat capacity at constant pressure @xmath26 , and thermal expansion coefficient @xmath27 , all of which are constant .",
    "we consider an homogeneous internal volumetric heating @xmath28 . in the absence of convection ,",
    "the static temperature profile @xmath29 is calculated by solving the diffusive heat equation and can be written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the imposed temperature at the boundary , @xmath32 .",

    "we use both spherical coordinates @xmath42 and cylindrical polar coordinates @xmath43 .",
    "we seek to model the system of equations  ( [ eq : ns1])-([eq : t1 ] ) for small ekman numbers .",
    "we choose the quasi - geostrophic ( qg ) approximation to model the evolution of the velocity field @xcite .",
    "the qg approximation reduces the three - dimensional system to a two - dimensional system by taking advantage of the small variation of the flow along @xmath44 due to the rapid rotation @xcite .",
    "this approximation is only justified in the case of small slope of the boundaries , such as the @xcite annulus . in the case of a sphere , the approximation is therefore not rigorously justified in any asymptotic limit .",
    "consequently , the qg model is intended as a simplified model of convection in a rapidly rotating sphere that allows us to investigate unexplored regions of the parameter space .",
    "when possible , comparisons with theoretical , experimental and 3d numerical models show that the qg model correctly reproduces key properties of the full system @xcite .",
    "the qg model assumes that the fluid dynamics is dominated by the geostrophic balance , i.e.  the coriolis force balances the pressure gradient .",

    "the normal component , @xmath64 , is the ekman pumping induced by the viscous boundary layer and is determined by asymptotic methods @xcite , @xmath65 this analytical formulation is valid for a linear ekman layer and for variations of the velocity that are slower than the rotation period and on larger lengthscales than @xmath66 .",

    "the convective flow is similar to the saturated case described previously in figure  [ fig : psi_sat_e8p2 ] .",
    "the main difference is that the amplitude of the flow in the inner convective region is concentrated in a localised structure , that drifts in the azimuthal direction with time .",
    "the localisation of the convection might indicate that the system struggles to maintain convection for this rayleigh number .",
    "however the kinetic energy of the convective and zonal flows do not decay during the entire time integration of the simulation , which corresponds to @xmath95 convective turnover timescales ( where one turnover timescale is calculated as @xmath170 ) , or equivalently , @xmath171 global thermal diffusion timescales . for larger rayleigh numbers , the localisation in the inner convective region disappears and the convection fills all longitudes , as observed for @xmath172 in figure  [ fig : psi_e8p2ra2 ] .",
    "the radial profile @xmath147 is plotted in figures  [ fig : psi_e8p2ra1.83]-[fig : psi_e8p2ra2 ] .",
    "the rms radial velocity peaks in the inner convective region , and then , monotonically decreases in the outer rossby wave region .",
    "the boundary between the convective inner region and the outer rossby wave region moves outwards when @xmath128 increases .",
    "the radial profile of the zonal flow , @xmath146 , is also plotted in figures  [ fig : psi_e8p2ra1.83]-[fig : psi_e8p2ra2 ] . as described in the saturated case of figure  [ fig : psi_sat_e8p2 ] , the zonal flow displays three jets in both cases .",
    "the peak of the middle retrograde jet roughly coincides with the maximum of @xmath147 .",
    "the zonal flows represent a significant portion of the total flow with the amplitude of @xmath106 increasing from @xmath173 to @xmath174 when @xmath175 varies from @xmath176 to @xmath177 .",
    "no significant change in the flow is observed when the rayleigh number is varied across the linear critical value @xmath99 , and all of the output parameters evolve continuously , similarly to @xmath104 in figure  [ fig : utot_e8p2 ] .",
    "no continuous branch of convection is found at @xmath127 when the convection is started from a small perturbation as described for @xmath124 .    within the interval @xmath178",
    ", the system has two stable solutions : one is located on the subcritical branch shown in red in figure  [ fig : utot_e8p2 ] and is found by using an initial condition with a large enough amplitude ; the other solution corresponds to @xmath164 and is found by starting the simulation from a small perturbation . in order to quantify how large the finite amplitude of the initial condition must be to access the subcritical branch , we perform a series of simulations where the initial condition is taken from a snapshot of the saturated solution on the subcritical branch for given parameters and we initially divide the amplitude of the velocity by a given factor . by a trial and error procedure , we determine the factor that separates a solution where the kinetic energy decays to zero from a solution where the kinetic energy grows back to the value on the subcritical branch .",
    "the limit between the values of @xmath150 of the initial condition leading to either the decaying solution or the growing solution are shown in figure  [ fig : utot_e8p2 ] .",
    "as expected , we find that for values of @xmath128 just above @xmath161 , the finite amplitude of the initial condition must be much larger than for values of @xmath128 just below @xmath99 .          for @xmath179 computed with our model ( hybrid qg-3d ) , with the 3d model of @xcite and the quasi - geostrophic model of @xcite .",
    "these numerical results are compared with the asymptotic results of @xcite .",
    "the dashed gray line represents the asymptotic results including first - order correction @xcite .",
    "]    the critical parameters calculated with our code @xmath180 are given in table  [ tab : critpar ] .",
    "as the ekman number is decreased , @xmath99 gets closer to the asymptotic value @xmath181 for all @xmath12 .",
    "the values of the critical parameters are plotted as a function of @xmath8 in figure  [ fig : onset_vs_ek ] for @xmath179 .",
    "the three critical parameters computed with our hybrid model tend towards the asymptotic values of the global stability analysis when @xmath8 decreases .",
    "the critical rayleigh number of our model is higher than the values obtained with both the 3d and qg-2d models .",
    "this is expected because of the stabilising effect of the axial rigidity imposed by the quasi - geostrophic formulation , while the 3d solution keeps a large - scale @xmath44-dependence @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our hybrid approach includes the axial diffusion of the temperature , which is neglected in the qg-2d model .",
    "the @xmath44-average of the buoyancy force is thus weaker in our hybrid approach , so @xmath99 is necessarily larger . the marginally stable mode @xmath182 is smaller in our hybrid model compared with the asymptotic results .",
    "again , this is consistent with the axial rigidity of the quasi - geostrophic flow , which requires the convection to first develop at a slightly smaller critical radius , thereby selecting a smaller @xmath182 .",
    "the critical parameters @xmath180 are plotted as a function of @xmath12 in figure  [ fig : onset_vs_pr ] .",
    "our hybrid model follows well the trend of the global asymptotic theory for the three critical parameters .",
    "convection at smaller @xmath12 develops on larger scales at the onset .",
    "accordingly , the critical frequency is larger ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "these results agree reasonably well with the trends given by the power laws of the local theory for @xmath183 and @xmath184 ( ( [ eq : b_mc])-([eq : b_wc ] ) ) when @xmath185 , but the prefactors differ significantly .",
    "the critical rayleigh number given by both our numerical results and the global asymptotic results differs greatly from the prediction of the local theory ( @xmath186 when @xmath187 ) , as already observed by @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy with @xmath188 ( [ eq : b_rac ] ) increases as the prandtl number decreases : the difference between local and global critical rayleigh number is nearly two orders of magnitude for @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite attributed this discrepancy to the tilt of the thermal rossby waves , which is more pronounced for small @xmath12 ."
