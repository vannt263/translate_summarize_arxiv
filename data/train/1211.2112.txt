    "recently , considerable effort has been put into extending ads / cft correspondence beyond high - energy physics by constructing gravity models that are conjectured to be dual to various condensed matter systems .",
    "this has lead to the discovery of holographic superconductors and holographic superfluids , describing condensed phases of strongly coupled , planar , gauge theories .",
    "studying such models involves the construction of electrically charged black holes in an asymptotically ads spacetime , which , below a critical temperature become unstable to forming hair .",
    "that is , a phase transition occurs to a superconductor / superfluid state , in which a sufficiently large @xmath3 charge density triggers the spontaneously breaking of the @xmath3 symmetry .",
    "then an operator charged under the @xmath3 acquires a nonzero expectation value ( see @xmath6 @xcite for a review of these aspects ) .    for @xmath5wave superconducting black holes ,",
    "the condensing operator is a vector and hence rotational symmetry is broken .",
    "such black hole solutions have been constructed using either charged non - abelian vector fields @xcite or , alternatively , charged two - forms @xcite .",
    "however , most of the studies in the literature have assumed an @xmath7 construction of the lagrangean of the gravitational system , without a clear connection with a given supergravity model , which makes it rather difficult to describe precisely the application of the ads / cft dictionary .    at the same time , the gauged supergravity models generically contain non - abelian vector fields , which may suggest the existence of @xmath5wave superconducting black hole solutions .",
    "the case of @xmath8 , @xmath1 gauged supergravity @xcite , @xcite is of particular interest , given its connection with @xmath9 @xmath10 super - yang - mills theory in @xmath11 dimensions .",
    "the bosonic sector of this theory consists of the metric , twenty scalars and fifteen @xmath12 yang - mills ( ym ) gauge fields gauged supergravity is richer .",
    "however , a number of bosonic fields can be consistently set to zero @xcite . ] .",
    "solutions of @xmath13 @xmath1 model have been considered by several authors for various consistent truncations , with subgroups of @xmath12 ( see @xmath6 @xcite and the references therein ) . however , to our knowledge , to date no attempt has been made to construct non - abelian superconducting black hole solutions in this context .",
    "this paper is aimed as a first step in this direction , by taking a consistent truncation of the @xmath14 model corresponding to @xmath0 , @xmath15 romans gauged supergravity , with a single scalar field @xmath16 possessing a potential @xmath17 which is the sum of two liouville terms .",
    "the scalar @xmath16 approaches asymptotically a constant value @xmath18 corresponding to an extremum of the potential , @xmath19 , which yields an effective cosmological constant @xmath20 .",
    "it turns out that the basic properties of the @xmath0 solutions with non - abelian fields are rather similar to those found for pure @xmath1 einstein - ym-@xmath21 system @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in particular , we find evidence for the existence , at low temperatures , of a superfluid state with a normalisable non - abelian condensate .",
    "since romans theory arises as a consistent kaluza - klein truncation of the type iib supergravity on an @xmath22 @xcite and as a consistent compactification of @xmath23 supergravity @xcite , this shows the existence of holographic superfluids in @xmath24 supergravities .",
    "the bosonic sector of the @xmath9 , @xmath1 romans gauged supergravity @xcite consists of gravity , a scalar @xmath16 , an @xmath2 ym potential @xmath25 ( with field strength @xmath26 and @xmath27 the su(2 ) gauge coupling constant ) , an abelian potential @xmath28 ( @xmath29 being the corresponding field strength ) , and a pair of two - form fields .",
    "these two form fields can consistently be set to zero , which yields the bosonic part of the action @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "here @xmath32 is the dilaton potential , @xmath33 being the @xmath3 gauge coupling constant .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , this theory has three canonical forms , corresponding to different choices of the gauge coupling constant @xmath33 .",
    "the case of interest here corresponds to the @xmath0 version , in which @xmath34 and thus the dilaton potential is @xmath35    the field equations are obtained by varying the action ( [ action5 ] ) with respect to the field variables @xmath36 and @xmath16 @xmath37 where the energy - momentum tensor is defined by @xmath38    the scalar potential has exactly one extremum at @xmath39 , corresponding to an the effective cosmological constant @xmath40 then the effective ads length scale is fixed by the non - abelian gauge coupling constant , @xmath41 .    as usual , one supplements ( [ action5 ] ) with a boundary term @xmath42 where",
    "apart from the hawking - gibbons surface term we include also a counterterm part which is required to regularize the total action and the global charges . in the above relation",
    ", @xmath43 is the ricci scalar for the induced metric @xmath44 of the boundary , @xmath45 is the trace of the extrinsic curvature , while @xmath46 ( this expression of the counterterm was derived in @xcite , in a more general context ) .",
    "then , as in the well known pure - ads case @xcite , one can construct a divergence - free boundary stress tensor @xmath47 from the total action @xmath48 by defining @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the einstein tensor of the boundary metric , @xmath51 is the extrinsic curvature , with @xmath52 being an outward pointing normal vector to the boundary .    thus , a conserved charge @xmath53can be associated with a surface @xmath54 ( with normal @xmath55 ) , provided the boundary geometry has an isometry generated by a killing vector @xmath56 .",
    "for example , if @xmath57 is a timelike killing vector , then @xmath58 is the conserved mass @xmath59 .",
    "we start with a discussion of the basic properties of the abelian black brane solutions of the @xmath0 romans model . they can be found as a particular limit of the black holes obtained in @xcite in the so - called stu model . in the general case",
    "these black holes possess three different @xmath3 charges and two independent scalars . after setting one scalar to zero and taking two gauge fields to be equal",
    ", one finds after a suitable field redefinition , the following black brane solution of the eqs .",

    "what follows , to avoid cluttering our expressions with complicated factors of @xmath27 , we use the observation that the above solution is left invariant by the transformation @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , and we set @xmath68 without any loss of generality .    the horizon is located @xmath69 , with @xmath70 the largest positive root of the equation @xmath71 , which reduces to @xmath72 although one can write an expression for @xmath73 , it turns out to be more convenient to express @xmath74 in terms of @xmath75 : @xmath76    as usual , the constants @xmath77 in the expressions of @xmath78 are found by imposing the regularity of the one - forms @xmath79 on the horizon , which implies @xmath80 thus , physically they correspond to the two chemical potentials associated with the system .",
    "a straightforward computation leads to the following expressions for the mass @xmath59 , electric charges @xmath81 and @xmath82 for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 fields , entropy @xmath83 and hawking temperature @xmath84 : @xmath85 with @xmath86 ; however , for the rest of this work , to simplify the expressions , we set @xmath87 , @xmath88 we shall work with mass , entropy and electric charge densities .",

    "a useful relation here is @xmath94 which defines @xmath95 , although an explicit formula can not be written in the general case .",
    "analytic results are found only when discussing the limiting cases with a vanishing @xmath96 or @xmath74 .",
    "the properties of the solutions with @xmath97 ( @xmath88 a consistent truncation of the model with a @xmath3 field only , @xmath98 ) are discussed at length in @xcite .",
    "no extremal configurations are found in this case , since the temperature is bounded from below , @xmath99 . for any given @xmath100 ,",
    "there are two branches of solutions , one of them being thermally stable .    by constrast",

    "one finds a single branch of solutions , with @xmath104,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which possesses a positive specific heat .",
    "the solutions with two @xmath3 charges exhibit a complicated picture , which is governed by the value of the relative ratio @xmath105 .",
    "the picture in figure 1 appears to be generic : for any @xmath106 , the solutions with small    to     + enough @xmath74 are thermally stable , the entropy increasing with the temperature ( note that @xmath107 , the geometry remaining regular in this limit ) .    however , when increasing @xmath74 we notice the occurance of three branches of solutions for some intermediate range of @xmath84 .",
    "the physically relevant branch ( which has less free energy ) is the third one , which continues to @xmath108 ( the large temperature behaviour is @xmath109 ) . also , the second branch is unstable since it possess a negative specific heat .    for a more systematic discussion of the properties of the generic abelian solutions , it turns out convenient to work with the following scaled quantities exact solution has an extra scaling symmetry @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 , with @xmath115 and @xmath116 an arbitrary constant .",

    "all the relevant quantities can then be expressed in terms of @xmath124 and @xmath125 only : @xmath126 it is clear that all solutions satisfy the condition @xmath127 the upper bound being approached for solutions with @xmath2 fields only . moreover ,",
    "the condition @xmath128 imposses a lower bound for the reduced entropy : @xmath129 where @xmath130 one can also show that the scaled @xmath3 charge @xmath131 has a finite range , with @xmath132 solutions with a maximal value of @xmath131 correspond to extremal black holes , with @xmath133 and @xmath134 . from ( [ metricu1xu1 - 14 ] ) , the reduced entropy of the extremal solutions can also be written as @xmath135 which is a nonvanishing quantity for @xmath136 .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath4 solutions should possess non - abelian generalizations .",
    "these configurations are found when enlarging the @xmath2 ansatz to include a nonzero magnetic potential such that the gauge potential @xmath137 is approached only asymptotically .    following previous work @xcite , @xcite on pure einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) solutions with vector hair , we choose an @xmath2 gauge fields ansatz possessing both electric and magnetic potentials , while the @xmath3 ansatz is still purely electric : @xmath138 also , as before , the dilaton field will depend on the @xmath139-coordinate only .",
    "this leads to a diagonal energy - momentum tensor and thus it is consistent to choose a diagonal metric ansatz .      before discussing the general solutions , it is instructive to consider the perturbative limit of the problem",
    ". then @xmath140 is treated as a small perturbation around the @xmath4 solutions , @xmath141 . after substituting into the linearized ym equations",
    ", one finds that @xmath142 solves @xmath143 for @xmath97 one finds the following exact solution of the above equation @xmath144 ( where @xmath145 are arbitrary constants ) .",
    "as one can see , this solution posseses an essential logarithmic singularity at the horizon and thus can not be treated as a perturbation .",
    "thus we conclude that only solutions which are charged with respect the @xmath2 fields may posses an instability .",

    "solutions interpolating between these asymptotics are constructed numerically . ] .",
    "the mechanism triggering the instability is similar to the pure eym-@xmath21 case @xcite , the magnetic gauge potential acquiring a tachyonic mass term near the horizon .",
    "interestingly , the picture found for @xmath101 is rather similar to that valid for @xmath97 since in this case too no solutions of ( [ pert2 ] ) with correct asymptotics are found . we conclude that , somehow unexpectedly , both electric charges ( associated with the @xmath2 and @xmath3 fields ) should be nonvanishing for the existence of a normalizable zero mode .    to    some results of the numerical integration",

    "the numerical construction of the solutions with @xmath210 requires a different metric ansatz than ( [ metric - an ] ) and is beyond the scope of this work .",

    "one can see that , for all cases we considered , non - abelian solutions exist only for values of the hawking temperature smaller than a critical temperature @xmath157 .",
