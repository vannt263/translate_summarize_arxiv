    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) techniques are among the most powerful and versatile methods for the computer simulation of a large variety of interesting quantum systems encountered in physics , chemistry or biology @xcite . in particular , qmc is capable of delivering numerically exact results . despite the great potential of this method , there are several restrictions and handicaps inherent to all qmc techniques , the perhaps most pressing one being due to the _ sign problem _ @xcite",
    ". there are various sign problems , namely the _ fermionic sign problem _ encountered in equilibrium ( imaginary - time ) simulations of strongly correlated many - fermion systems , and the _ dynamical sign problem _ in real - time ( dynamical ) simulations , which already shows up for a single particle .",
    "unfortunately , apart from variational or approximate treatments ( such as the fixed - node approximation ) , a completely general and totally satisfactory solution to the sign problem in qmc simulations is still lacking .",
    "nevertheless , over the past few years considerable and substantial progress has been achieved along several different lines without introducing approximations into the qmc scheme , see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite .    in these notes focus is put on one specific class of qmc methods called _ path - integral monte carlo ( pimc)_. pimc is based on a discretized path - integral representation of the quantities of interest .",
    "the sign problem then arises when different paths that contribute to averages carry different sign ( or complex - valued phase ) .",
    "for instance , for the fermionic sign problem , as a consequence of exchange , one typically has to deal with determinants , so that non - positive - definite fermionic density matrix elements arise .",
    "the sign cancellations arising from sampling fermion paths then manifest themselves as a signal - to - noise ratio , @xmath0 , that vanishes exponentially with both particle number @xmath1 and inverse temperature @xmath2 ; here @xmath3 is a system - dependent energy scale .",
    "the small signal surviving the interference of many fermion paths is then inevitably lost in the large background noise of the stochastic simulation .",
    "similarly , when studying the real - time dynamics of even a single particle , the quantum - mechanical time evolution operator @xmath4 attaches a complex - valued phase to each quantum path , which in turn gives rise to the dynamical sign problem .",
    "again the signal - to - noise ratio will vanish exponentially , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the maximum real time under study and @xmath7 a system- and implementation - specific characteristic time scale .",
    "the exponential scaling is typical for the `` naive '' approach , where one simple uses the absolute value of the complex - valued weight function for the mc sampling , and includes the phase information in the accumulation .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a general scheme for tackling the sign problem in pimc simulations was proposed .",
    "the method has been applied to interacting electrons in a quantum dot  @xcite and to the real - time dynamics of simple few - degrees - of - freedom systems @xcite .",
    "the generalization of the algorithm to the case of effective actions  which are long - ranged along the trotter or real - time direction  along with the application to the dissipative two - state ( spin - boson ) dynamics has been given in refs .",
    "this _ multilevel blocking _ ( mlb ) approach represents the systematic implementation of a simple _ blocking strategy_. the blocking strategy states that by sampling groups of paths ( `` blocks '' ) at the same time , the sign problem can always be reduced compared to sampling single paths as would be done normally ; for a proof , see sec .  [ block ] below .",
    "by suitably bunching paths together into sufficiently small blocks , the sign cancellations among paths within the same block can be accounted for without the sign problem , simply because there is no sign problem for a sufficiently small system .",
    "the mlb approach is based on a recursive implementation of this idea , i.e.  after building `` elementary '' blocks , new blocks are formed out of these , and the process is then iterated .",
    "this leads to a powerful implementation of the blocking strategy .",
    "this algorithm is able to turn the exponential severity of the sign problem into an `` only '' algebraic one .",
    "this is still difficult enough but in practice implies that significantly larger systems ( lower temperature , longer real time ) can be studied by mlb - pimc than under the naive pimc approach .",
    "nevertheless , it should be stressed that mlb is definitely _ not _  a black - box scheme .",
    "there are several potential pitfalls related to incorrect or inadequate choices of certain mlb parameters , and one needs to be quite careful in applying this technique @xcite . given some experience",
    ", however , it represents a powerful handle to relieve the sign problem , with potential for additional improvement .",

    "[ mlbform ] to [ performance ] . in the last part",
    "the generalization of mlb to pimc simulations of the effective - action type is described .",
    "let us consider a many - fermion system whose state is described by a set of quantum numbers @xmath8 denoting , e.g.  the positions and spins of _ all _ particles .",
    "these quantum numbers can correspond to electrons living on a lattice or in continuous space . for notational simplicity , we focus on calculating the equilibrium expectation value of a diagonal operator or correlation function ( this can be easily generalized ) , @xmath9 where @xmath10 represents either a summation for the case of a discrete system or an integration for a continuous system , and @xmath11 denotes the ( reduced ) density matrix of the system . in pimc applications ,",
    "imaginary time is discretized into @xmath12 slices of length @xmath13 .",
    "inserting complete sets at each slice @xmath14 , and denoting the corresponding configuration on slice @xmath15 by @xmath16 , the diagonal elements of the density matrix at @xmath17 entering eq .",
    "( [ fir ] ) are : @xmath18 . to proceed",
    ", one then has to construct accurate analytical approximations for the short - time propagator .",
    "this formulation of the problem excludes effective actions such as those arising from an integration over the fermions using the hubbard - stratonovich transformation @xcite , since that generally leads to long - ranged imaginary - time interactions .",
    "the mlb approach suitable for such a situation @xcite is described below in sec .",
    "[ effact ] .",
    "since we are dealing with a many - fermion system , the short - time propagators need to be antisymmetrized , leading to the appearance of determinants causing the sign problem . strictly speaking",
    ", the antisymmetrization has to be done only on one time slice , but the intrinsic sign problem is much better behaved if one antisymmetrizes on all time slices .",
    "choosing the absolute value of the product of the short - time propagators in eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) as the positive definite mc weight function @xmath19 $ ] , one has to keep the sign @xmath20 $ ] associated with a particular discretized path @xmath21 during the accumulation procedure , @xmath22 \\phi[x ] a[x ] }   { \\sum_{x } p[x ] \\phi[x ] } \\;.\\ ] ] assuming that there are no further exclusivity problems in the numerator so that @xmath23 $ ] is well - behaved , one can then analyze the sign problem in terms of the variance of the denominator , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the number of mc samples taken and stochastic averages are calculated with @xmath12 as the weight function . for the fermion sign problem , where @xmath26 and hence @xmath27 , the variance of the signal is controlled by the size of @xmath28 .",
    "remarkably , one can achieve considerable progress by _ blocking paths together_. instead of sampling single paths along the mc trajectory , one can consider sampling sets of paths called blocks .",
    "under such a blocking operation , the stochastic estimate for @xmath29 takes the form @xmath30 \\phi[x ] a[x ] \\right ) }   { \\sum_{b } \\left(\\sum_{x\\in b } p[x ] \\phi[x ] \\right ) } \\;,\\ ] ] where one first sums over the configurations belonging to a block @xmath31 in a way that is not affected by the sign problem , and then stochastically sums over the blocks . the summation within a block",
    "must therefore be done non - stochastically , or alternatively the block size must be chosen sufficiently small .",
    "of course , there is considerable freedom in how to choose this blocking .",
    "let us analyze the variance @xmath32 of the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ start2 ] ) .",
    "first define new sampling functions in terms of the blocks which are then sampled stochastically , @xmath33 = \\left| \\sum_{x \\in b } p[x ] \\phi[x ] \\right| \\;,\\quad \\phi'[b ] = { \\rm sgn } \\left(\\sum_{x \\in b } p[x ] \\phi[x]\\right ) \\;.\\ ] ] rewriting the average sign in the new representation , i.e.  using @xmath34 $ ] as the weight , then inserting the definition of @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the numerator , @xmath37 \\rangle =   \\frac{\\sum_{b } p'[b ] \\phi'[b ] } { \\sum_b p'[b ] } = \\frac{\\sum_{x } p[x ] \\phi [ x ] } { \\sum_b p'[b ] } \\;,\\ ] ] and comparing to the average sign in the standard representation using @xmath19 $ ] as the weight , one finds @xmath38 } { \\sum_{b } p'[b ] } \\;.\\ ] ] by virtue of the schwarz inequality , @xmath39 = \\sum_{b } \\left| \\sum_{x\\in b }   p[x ] \\phi[x ] \\right|\\leq \\sum_{b } \\left| \\sum_{x\\in   b } p[x ] \\right|   = \\sum_{x } p[x]\\;,\\ ] ] it follows that _ for any kind of blocking _ , the average sign improves , @xmath40 .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath41 , eq .  ( [ var ] ) implies that @xmath42 and hence _ the signal - to - noise ratio is always improved upon blocking configurations together_. clearly , the worst blocking one could possibly choose would be to group the configurations into two separate blocks , one collecting all paths with positive sign and the other with negative sign . in this case , blocking yields no improvement whatsoever , and the `` @xmath43 '' becomes `` @xmath44 '' in eq .",
    "( [ eqi ] ) .",
    "it is apparent from eq .",
    "( [ eqi ] ) that the blocking strategy provides a systematic handle to reduce the sign problem . in our realization of the blocking strategy ,",
    "a block is defined by all paths that differ only at one time slice , i.e.  only @xmath16 is updated with all other @xmath45 being frozen .",
    "a direct implementation of the blocking strategy does indeed improve the sign problem but will not remove its exponential severity .",
    "the reason is simply that for a sufficiently large system , there will be too many blocks , and once the signals coming from these blocks are allowed to interfere , one again runs into the sign problem , albeit with a smaller scale @xmath3 entering the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the resolution to this problem comes from the multilevel blocking ( mlb ) approach  @xcite where one _ applies the blocking strategy in a recursive manner to the blocks _ again . in a sense ,",
    "new blocks containing a sufficiently small number of elementary ones are formed , and this process is repeated until only one block is left .",
    "each step of this hierarchy is called _ level _  in what follows .",
    "blocks are then defined living on these _ levels _ , and after taking care of the sign cancellations within all blocks on a given ( fine ) level , the resulting sign information is transferred to the next ( coarser ) level . on each step , the blocking strategy ensures that no sign problem occurs _",
    "provided one has chosen sufficiently small block sizes_. by doing this recursively , the sign problem on all the coarser levels can be handled in the same manner .",
    "it is then possible to proceed without numerical instabilities from the bottom up to the top level .",
    "the cancellations arising at the top level will create a sign problem again , which is however strongly reduced .",
    "as is argued below , the resulting sign problem is characterized by an only algebraic severity .    in many ways ,",
    "the mlb idea is related to the renormalization group approach .",
    "but instead of integrating out information on fine levels , sign cancellations are `` synthesized '' within a given level and subsequently their effects are transferred to coarser levels . while the renormalization group filters out information judged `` relevant '' and then ignores the `` irrelevant '' part , no such approximation is introduced here .",
    "therefore our approach is actually closer in spirit to the multi - grid algorithm @xcite .",
    "the technical implementation of mlb is discussed next following ref .",
    "@xcite .      to keep notation simple",
    ", the slice index @xmath15 is used as a shorthand notation for the quantum numbers @xmath46 . from eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) the _",

    ", such that there are @xmath57 ( but @xmath58 ) different slices on level @xmath50 , see fig .  [ fig0 ] .",
    "an elementary blocking is achieved by grouping together configurations that differ only at slice @xmath15 , so only @xmath46 varies in that block while all @xmath59 remain fixed .",
    "sampling on level @xmath50 therefore extends over configurations @xmath60 living on the @xmath61 different slices .",
    "in the mlb scheme , one moves recursively from the finest ( @xmath54 ) up to the coarsest level ( @xmath62 ) , and the measurement of the diagonal operator is done only at the top level using the configuration @xmath63 .",

    "however , for @xmath163 , scaling concepts and also niba are expected to fail dramatically .",
    "this is seen in the simulations .",
    "mlb results show that away from the scaling limit , quantum coherence is able to persist for much longer , and both frequency and decay rate of the oscillations differ significantly from the predictions of niba . in electron transfer reactions in the adiabatic - to - nonadiabatic crossover regime ,",
    "such coherence effects can then strongly influence the low - temperature dynamics .",
    "one obvious and important consequence of these coherence effects is the breakdown of a rate description , implying that theories based on an imaginary - time formalism might not be appropriate in this regime .",
    "a detailed analysis of this crossover regime using mlb is currently in progress @xcite .",
    "these notes summarize our previous activities using the multilevel blocking approach to the sign problem in path - integral monte carlo simulations .",
    "the approach holds substantial promise towards relieving ( and eventually overcoming ) the sign problem , but clearly there is still much room for improvement .",
    "the applications presented here demonstrate unambiguously that there are general and powerful handles to relieve the sign problem , even though a problem characterized by an intrinsic sign problem is still much harder than one without .",
    "we hope that especially young researchers will be attracted to work on this subject themselves .",
