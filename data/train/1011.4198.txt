    "stochastic resonance ( sr ) was discovered theoretically about three decades ago@xcite . since then sr has been investigated with vigour and many notable reviews have appeared , for instance refer@xcite .",
    "physical systems are always subject to internal or external ( thermal or otherwise ) fluctuations ( noise ) .",
    "the optimal periodic response of a system to an external periodic drive as a function of noise strength is termed as stochastic resonance .",
    "it has been experimentally found to occur , to just mention a few , in electronic circuits@xcite , two - mode ring lasers@xcite , nanomechanical systems@xcite , neuronal systems@xcite , etc .",
    "its main attraction lies in its practical utility of selecting and enhancing a signal of a particular frequency out of a host of signals by tuning the noise strength .",
    "presumably , biological systems use sr to their advantage@xcite .",
    "it has the potential to be utilized to control kinetically the pathways of a biochemical reaction@xcite .",
    "sr has been predicted and shown to occur mostly in bistable systems@xcite .",
    "however , there has been some notable investigations of sr in monostable and also periodic potential systems@xcite . in the monostable systems sr",
    "is shown to occur in the high frequency regime close to the natural frequency of oscillation at the bottom of the potential . however , the occurrence of sr in periodic potentials have not been conclusive@xcite .",
    "dykman and coworkers@xcite use an interesting model in which a single - well duffing oscillator with additive noise is driven at a frequency close to the natural frequency of the oscillator .",
    "the model is used under linear response theory formalism to study fluctuation phenomena associated with two coexisting periodic attractors .",
    "a weak gaussian noise causes transition between these two attractors .",
    "the populations of these two attractors become equal at a particular noise strength where the response becomes maximum .",
    "this is considered as a genuine signature of a ( nonconventional ) stochastic resonance .",
    "the theoretical result was supported by an analog electronic circuit experiment .",
    "a similar result was obtained in an underdamped superconducting quantum interference device@xcite .",
    "the same resonance behaviour , as in ref.@xcite , in the frequency dependent mobility was obtained in a periodic potential using linear response theory by kim and sung@xcite in the high frequency range of the external periodic drive .",
    "however , these authors ascribe this resonant behaviour as simply a noise assisted standard dynamical resonance as the transitions involve only intra - well motion .",
    "also , in the inter - well hopping ( low ) frequency regime the frequency dependent mobility shows monotonic behaviour as a function of noise strength thereby discounting the possibility of occurrence of sr in periodic structures .",
    "however , the authors show that sr can occur if the driven system has a tilted periodic potential so that the passages are allowed only in one direction .",
    "moreover , recently , it was observed that in a bistable potential , @xmath0 , the confinement parameter @xmath1 plays an important role in deciding whether the system will show sr or not@xcite . for @xmath2",
    "the system shows sr whereas for @xmath3 it does not .",
    "in addition , we find the input energy expended per period of the external field on the system by the field acts as a good quantifier of sr@xcite .",
    "this input energy is ultimately dissipated into the thermal bath .",
    "this is naturally a measure of the hysteresis loop area in position(@xmath4)-force(@xmath5 ) space .",
    "although the input energy and hysteresis loop area are exactly the same in magnitude the latter is an average quantity , whereas input energy has a well defined distribution .",
    "the input energy distribution provides useful information about stochastic resonance behaviour .",
    "in particular , the distribution shows a characteristic largest shoulder ( bimodality ) at stochastic resonance@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "hysteresis loops carry important information about phase relationship between @xmath4 and @xmath5 which have also been of interest to sr@xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we explore the possibility of occurrence of sr in a periodic sinusoidal potential using input energy and hysteresis loop area as quantifiers .",
    "moreover , one can take various values of the wavevector @xmath6 of the potential analogously varying the effect of confinement parameter @xmath1 of the bistable potential discussed above .",
    "we , however , present results for @xmath7 only .",
    "we find that the periodic sinusoidal potential does not show sr when driven by a low frequency field corresponding to kramers rates across the maxima of the potential or when driven at a still lower frequency .",
    "the same conclusion have been arrived at in ref.@xcite while studying the diffusion coefficient in a periodic system .",
    "however , it should be noted that in ref.@xcite the probability @xmath8 of a particle , after going from one well to an adjacent one returns back to the same initial well in the subsequent time @xmath9 , shows periodic peaks .",
    "the strength of the first peak of @xmath8 shows sr - like behaviour .",
    "however , @xmath8 has , by construction , the bearings of a bistable system and not that of a periodic potential system .",
    "we further find that in the high frequency range the input energy behaves exactly similarly as the response function in the works of dykman and coworkers@xcite and as the frequency dependent mobility does in the work of kim and sung@xcite .",
    "in addition , our work shows that the input energy peaks as a function of noise strength . this is an indication of sr arising due to a competition between two dynamical states of particle trajectories ( to be elaborated in section iii ) as in the case of bistable systems .",
    "though the trajectories are intra - well in nature close to sr the transition between these two states are also aided by inter - well passages of particles across the potential maxima .",
    "the two dynamical states of trajectories are distinctly identified by the phase difference @xmath10 between the periodic forcing @xmath11 and the trajectory @xmath12 ; one having a fixed phase lag @xmath13 and the other @xmath14 . note that the system , at finite @xmath15 , being stochastic in nature @xmath16 and @xmath17 are average quantities . these individual phase lags @xmath16 and @xmath17 effectively do not vary with the noise strength . however , the relative cumulative length of these two dynamical states in a trajectory change with the noise strength . the average phase lag , therefore , changes with noise strength , similar to what was predicted and observed in ref.@xcite in the case of bistable systems .",
    "moreover , the distribution of input energy shows very similar behaviour across the input energy peak as in case of sr in a bistable system thus affirming the genuineness of sr in the present periodic potential system .",
    "we consider two model systems for our study . in one case the medium",
    "is considered to having uniform friction , whereas in the other case the friction is considered to be nonuniform .",
    "the nonuniform friction @xmath18 has an exact analogy in the resistively coupled shunted junction ( rcsj ) model of josephson junction . in the rcsj model the @xmath19 term , arising out of the interference between the quasiparticle tunneling and the cooper pair tunneling across the junction , is equivalent to the nonuniform part of @xmath18 in the present case .",
    "the systems with nonuniform friction , however , are not very rare and are not without practical relevance@xcite .",
    "since the potential is symmetric and periodic the homogeneous system does not show any average mobility .",
    "the nonuniform system , however , shows average current when driven by a sinusoidal forcing in the underdamped system@xcite .",
    "interestingly , for the uniform system , @xmath20 and @xmath21 whereas in the nonuniform case , @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in either case",
    "the trajectories have distributions of these two phases depending on the noise strength .",
    "this is reflected in the form of the @xmath24 hysteresis loops and hence in the average response amplitude and phase lag . in the homogeneous case",
    "the behaviour of the average phase lag only approximately conforms to the sr prediction of @xcite and in the other case it follows closely the observations of @xcite in bistable systems .",
    "in this work , we consider the underdamped motion of a particle in a periodic potential @xmath25 which is symmetric in space ( about @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) .",
    "the system is driven periodically by an external forcing @xmath28=@xmath29 .",
    "we study two cases of the system  when the friction coefficient @xmath30 is uniform ( = @xmath31 ) ( system is homogeneous ) and when the friction coefficient is space dependent @xmath32 ( system is inhomogeneous ) . in the latter case ,",
    "the friction is periodic with the same periodicity as the potential but has a phase difference @xmath33 with it ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "@xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) determines the degree of inhomogeneity of the system ( @xmath37 corresponds to the homogeneous system ) .",
    "a particle of mass @xmath38 moving in a periodic potential @xmath39 in a medium with friction coefficient @xmath30 and subjected to an external periodic forcing @xmath28 is considered to be described by the langevin equation , @xmath40    @xmath41    eqn .",
    "( 2.1 ) is for the inhomogeneous system and eqn .",
    "( 2.2 ) for the homogeneous system .",
    "the temperature @xmath15 is in units of the boltzmann constant @xmath42 .",
    "the inherent random fluctuations in the system are represented by @xmath43 which satisfy the statistics : @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "the equations are written in dimensionless units by setting @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath7 .",
    "the langevin equation , with reduced variables denoted again now by the same symbols , corresponding to eqns .",
    "( 2.1 ) and ( 2.2 ) are written as @xmath48    @xmath49    the potential barrier between any two consecutive wells of @xmath50 disappears at the critical field value @xmath51 .",
    "the noise variable , in the same symbol @xmath52 , satisfies exactly similar statistics as earlier .",
    "the trajectories @xmath53 are obtained numerically@xcite by solving the langevin equations ( 2.3 ) and ( 2.4 ) corresponding to the inhomogeneous and the homogeneous system , respectively , with the amplitude of the drive field , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , with @xmath56 .",
    "the value of @xmath57 is close to the natural frequency of the potential . at high temperatures",
    "@xmath15 the average behaviour of these trajectories is the same independent of the initial conditions .",
    "however , at low temperatures , and especially in the limit of deterministic motion , and at such a low field amplitude as @xmath54 , the trajectories are intra - well in nature . yet",
    ", their behaviour is very sensitive to the initial conditions , @xmath58 and @xmath59@xcite . in our numerical calculations",
    "we take @xmath60 and @xmath61 at @xmath62 equispaced intervals , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , between the two consecutive peaks , e.g. @xmath65 $ ] , of the periodic potential @xmath50 . in most of the cases we take @xmath66 , but at some values of temperature",
    "we take @xmath67 .",
    "depending on the range of @xmath61 we get two distinctly different kinds of trajectories ; one that lags behind the applied field by a small phase difference @xmath16 and the other by a large phase difference @xmath17 . only for the sake of convenience , we call the former kind of trajectories as being _ in - phase _ and the other as being _ out - of - phase_. the out - of - phase trajectories always have much higher amplitude than the in - phase trajectories , fig.1 . at the lowest temperature considered here",
    "there is no transition between these dynamical states of trajectories .",
    "however , as the temperature ( or the noise strength ) is increased transitions do take place , fig.1 .",
    "yet , the trajectories are found basically only in these two states even at temperatures where inter - well transitions lead the trajectories out of the initial well .",
    "following stochastic enegetics formulation of sekimoto@xcite the input energy , or work done by the field on the system , @xmath68 , in a period @xmath69 , is calculated as @xmath70 where , the potential @xmath71 , and @xmath72 , @xmath73 .",
    "the average input energy per period over an entire trajectory @xmath74 , is @xmath75 typically , the number of periods , @xmath76 , taken in a trajectory ranges between @xmath77 to @xmath78 , as required .",
    "finally , the average input energy per period @xmath79 is calculated by averaging @xmath74 over all the trajectories . from eqn .",
    "( 3.1 ) the distribution @xmath80 is also calculated . as we shall see below @xmath80",
    "provides an important complementary criterion for stochastic resonance .",
    "eqn.(3.1 ) can be further written as @xmath81 which is the hysteresis loop area over a period . since @xmath53 is a stochastic variable it is unresonable to expect a sensible hysteresis loop over a period of the field . however , when averaged over the entire duration of a trajectory a well defined hysteresis loop @xmath82 and its area @xmath83 is obtained : @xmath84 for all @xmath85 $ ] and @xmath86 the calculation of the hysteresis loops @xmath82 , eqn .",
    "( 3.3 ) , is correct at the lowest temperatures where the trajectories maintain the same phase @xmath10 throughout and also at higher temperatures where trajectories change phase between @xmath16 and @xmath17 during their journey .",
    "however , the hysteresis loops will be different for different trajectories depending on the cumulative duration of the dynamical states @xmath87 of the segments of the individual trajectories .",
    "therefore , an ensemble average @xmath88 is taken over all the trajectories considered .",
    "the hysteresis loop @xmath88 , with area @xmath89 , reflects the average response @xmath53 of the system to the applied field @xmath28 . in the linear response regime",
    "one would expect @xmath90 for @xmath91 , @xmath55 , where @xmath92 is the average phase lag to be observed experimentally@xcite .",
    "notice that @xmath92 will , in general , be different from the fixed phases @xmath16 and @xmath17 characterising the individual dynamical phases of the trajectories .    in the following , we present the results of our numerical calculations and analyse how the particle trajectories in the sinusoidal potential and hence the input energy , and the hysteresis loops are affected by noise strength .",
    "we examine the occurrence of stochastic resonance in the periodic potential , referring to the standard sr criteria in bistable systems .",
    "fig.2a shows the plot of input energy @xmath74 averaged over a trajectory with initial position x(0 ) at the lowest temperature @xmath93 for the homogeneous system ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "@xmath74 are confined to two narrow bands around 0.094 and 1.179 corresponding to @xmath61 values that lie in contiguous regions in the range @xmath95 $ ] and no points in between .",
    "the input energies @xmath96 correspond to in - phase trajectories with phase lag @xmath97 and those with @xmath98 correspond to out - of - phase trajectories with phase lag @xmath99 . the trajectories continue to be in the same state of phase lag throughout their course of journey . at this low temperature",
    "the trajectories are quite stable .",
    "the inset of fig.2a shows the @xmath100 plane poincar ( stroboscopic ) plots revealing the two attractors corresponding to the two dynamical states of the trajectories .",
    "the ( stochastic ) spread in the plots is due to the finite temperature of the system .",
    "it may be recalled that the results are obtained by taking @xmath60",
    ". however , the two dynamical states of trajectory are genuinely stable as revealed , in fig.3 , by the basins of attraction of the two attractors at @xmath93 . in the figure",
    "the in - phase and the out - of - phase states are indicated respectively by inp(@xmath101 ) and outp(@xmath38 ) for @xmath102 , etc .",
    "the indices @xmath103 ( within the braces ) specify the well number where the particle settles down as it begins from the initial well ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "even though the attractors correspond to wells @xmath105 , the phase and amplitude of the trajectories remain exactly the same as when in the initial well ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "thus , the differently labeled trajectories are physically the same two and the only two : the in - phase and the out - of - phase with fixed @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "fig.2b shows the same plot as fig.2a but at @xmath106 .",
    "the figure clearly shows that a few points have deserted the upper band of @xmath74 and all of them but one have already joined and the lone one on its way to join the lower band of @xmath74 .",
    "this shows that all of these few out - of - phase trajectories have made a transition to the in - phase state ( as shown in fig.1 ) quite early during the @xmath77 periods of the trajectory and the lone one somewhere in the middle of all these periods .",
    "it is to be noted that no transition has taken place from the in - phase state to the out - of - phase state .",
    "this shows that the out - of - phase state is less stable than the in - phase state and are separated by an energy barrier of about @xmath107 ( in units of @xmath108 , the amplitude of the sinusoidal potential ) from the out - of - phase side .",
    "this trend continues till @xmath109 where @xmath74 consists of only one band , that is the lower band , fig.2c .",
    "the stroboscopic plot in the @xmath100 space , inset of fig.2c , shows the lone attractor at @xmath109 .",
    "the other attractor has now ceased to exist . from @xmath106",
    "to @xmath109 the ensemble averaged input energy @xmath79 decreases very rapidly attaining the lowest value at @xmath109 .    for @xmath110 ,",
    "transitions start taking place from the in - phase to the out - of - phase state too .",
    "consequently , @xmath79 begins rising for @xmath110 .",
    "of course , the out - of - phase state lives for a very short duration before a larger temperature is reached .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig.4 , for @xmath111 .",
    "therefore , there is an energy barrier of roughly about 0.016 from the in - phase state side to the out - of - phase side .",
    "one can thus roughly pictorise the two states as shown in fig.5 with the bottom of the wells at @xmath112 and @xmath113 .    as the temperature",
    "is increased further the relative population of out - of - phase state keeps increasing with increase of temperature .",
    "the transitions in both the directions maintain a constant ratio at any given temperature .",
    "moreover , by the temperature @xmath114 the inter - well transitions have already set in and have become numerous .",
    "these inter - well transitions also help intra - well transitions , fig.6 . at around @xmath115 , the relative population of both the states become almost equal and the input energy @xmath79 peaks .",
    "@xmath115 , thus , falls in the region of kinetic phase transition@xcite between the two dynamical states .    beyond @xmath115 ,",
    "the intra - well transitions become more frequent and so do the inter - well transitions .",
    "the transition points or the attempted transition points lead to lower amplitude motion .",
    "this results in gradual lowering of @xmath79 with temperature . at much higher temperatures @xmath116 the ( intra -",
    "well as well as inter - well ) transitions become so numerous that the phases effectively lose their distinct identity .",
    "this gets reflected in the input energy distribution @xmath80 as a single peak ( fig.7 , @xmath117 ) .    in fig.7 the probability distribution of @xmath68",
    "is drawn for various temperatures .",
    "at the lowest temperature @xmath106 we see two distinct peaks of @xmath80 : the low @xmath68 peak corresponding predominantly to the in - phase state of trajectory and the other to the out - of - phase state . as the temperature",
    "is gradually increased the large @xmath68 peak shrinks and at @xmath109 this peak disappears completely .",
    "however , as the temperature is increased further the out - of - phase peak reappears and begin to swell to maximise at @xmath118 . at @xmath115 the broad shoulder of @xmath80 characterises the peak in @xmath79 . at the largest temperature shown @xmath117",
    "both the peaks merge into a broad single peak .",
    "though @xmath79 always remains @xmath119 thus never violating the second law of thermodynamics , interestingly , @xmath80 is not confined to @xmath120 but a significant part of it lies at @xmath121 .    fig.8 shows the variation of @xmath79 as a function of temperature @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath79 peaks at a temperature around @xmath115 .",
    "this is a clear signature of stochastic resonance even if the criterion for sr in a bistable system is adhered to as a benchmark@xcite .",
    "this is supported by the behaviour of @xmath80 across @xmath115 .",
    "@xmath80 shows a prominent shoulder@xcite , characteristic of sr , around @xmath115 , fig.7 . in the following we examine the behaviour of phase lag of the response to the periodic field .      from eqns .",
    "( 3.3 ) , ( 3.4 ) and ( 3.5 ) the hysteresis loop area @xmath89 being equal in magnitude to @xmath79 , @xmath89 does not provide any additional information than @xmath79 .",
    "however , the hysteresis loop itself does give an important insight .",
    "the amplitude @xmath54 of the external applied field @xmath91 being small , one expects the response , namely the position @xmath53 , to have a linear variation with @xmath28 : @xmath12 .",
    "hence , the hysteresis loop @xmath88 will closely be an ellipse .",
    "the average phase difference @xmath92 is measured from the resulting ellipse , eqn .",
    "( 3.4 ) . unlike @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , which remain more or less constant with @xmath15 ,",
    "the average phase difference @xmath92 varies with @xmath15 , as shown in fig.9 . in fig.9 , the average amplitude @xmath122 and the average area @xmath89",
    "are also plotted for comparison .    at the lowest temperature @xmath93 ,",
    "@xmath92 is close to @xmath21 . at this temperature , @xmath122 as well as @xmath89 are also at their respective maxima . as @xmath15 is increased @xmath123 as well as @xmath89 decrease sharply , and attain a minimum at around @xmath109 .",
    "the minimum @xmath92 is close to @xmath20 .",
    "this is because at @xmath109 all the trajectories are in the dynamical state of phase @xmath16 .",
    "thereafter for @xmath110 , @xmath123 increases monotonically .",
    "the inflection point of @xmath124 occurs at @xmath125 , where @xmath126 as observed in ref@xcite .",
    "however , @xmath89 becomes maximum only at a much higher temperature @xmath127 , where @xmath128 .",
    "therefore , @xmath89 here does not exactly satisfy the additional approximate sr criterion on @xmath92 suggested in ref@xcite .",
    "however , in the inhomogeneous system , the sr criterion on @xmath92 suggested using linear response theory@xcite appears to be respected .      in this case",
    "the particle experiences a nonuniform friction as it moves in the medium .",
    "as stated earlier the potential is considered periodic : @xmath129 .",
    "the friction coefficient @xmath18 is taken as @xmath130 instead of the constant friction coefficient @xmath94 as in the homogeneous case .",
    "we take fixed values @xmath131 and phase difference @xmath132 throughout .",
    "@xmath133 provides the necessary asymmetry in the system to yield an average particle current , the ratchet current@xcite , even when driven by a zero time - average external forcing @xmath91 . for @xmath7 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and",
    "@xmath136 the system shows a current maximum at @xmath137 . keeping @xmath138 and other parameters",
    "fixed the current maximizes at @xmath139 .",
    "however , we do not see any maximum in the periodic response , such as the hysteresis loop area , to the external periodic field corresponding to these parameters .",
    "the system does not show sr at this low frequency of drive .    here ,",
    "the particle position @xmath53 does roughly follow the periodic field with an irregular but large amplitude .",
    "there is also a small amplitude high frequency component superimposed on the low frequency response to the field .",
    "the frequency of the superimposed component is close to the natural frequency of the potential . in the following we consider the external field @xmath28 with @xmath54 and @xmath56 , exactly as in the homogeneous case , but keeping in mind that in the inhomogeneous case the system is no longer symmetric .",
    "therefore , even at this high frequency the system shows an average ratchet current but the current itself does not show any peaking behaviour with @xmath15 .      as in the homogeneous case ,",
    "the system shows two distict dynamical states of trajectories .",
    "one with phase difference @xmath140 and the other with @xmath23 .",
    "we again call the trajectories with phase difference @xmath16 as being in - phase and the other as out - of - phase with the external field .",
    "the latter having much higher response amplitude @xmath122 than the former .",
    "the frictional nonuniformity , surprisingly , leads to out - of - phase trajectory amplitude about three times larger than in the homogeneous case and therefore larger average energy @xmath79 . as a consequence ,",
    "the results are qualitatively different from what was observed in the case of uniform friction system .    at the lowest temperature @xmath93",
    "the trajectories are bunched into two contiguous groups and continue to be so for all time without ever jumping across the groups , fig.10a .",
    "the inset of fig.10a shows , in the @xmath100 plane stroboscopic plots , the two attractors corresponding to the two dynamical states of particle trajectories .",
    "the situation remains the same till @xmath141 .",
    "however , the average energy @xmath79 decreases with @xmath15 due to a slight decrease in the out - of - phase trajectory amplitude .",
    "contrast this with the sharp decline in energy in the homogeneous case due to transition from out - of - phase states to the in - phase states . at @xmath15 around 0.011 transitions begin to take place from the in - phase states to the out - of - phase states , fig.10b ; the out - of - phase state is more stable .",
    "the @xmath79 rises sharply thereafter .",
    "however , by @xmath142 transitions are also observed from out - of - phase states to the in - phase states , fig.10c . therefore , the potential barrier from out - of - phase side to the in - phase side is about 0.011 , whereas in the reverse direction the barrier height is about 0.014 .",
    "both the states are _ almost _ equally stable . by the temperature @xmath109",
    "even inter - well transitions are observed , fig.10d .    as the temperature",
    "is increased to 0.018 the average energy @xmath79 attains a maximum . at this point",
    "the two states become almost equally populated , a point in the region of kinetic phase transition@xcite .",
    "the variation of @xmath79 is plotted in fig.11 as a function of temperature .",
    "this is a signature of stochastic resonance occurring at @xmath143 .",
    "the distribution @xmath80 again shows the largest asymmetry at the same temperature @xmath143 . here",
    "@xmath80 is distinctly bimodal in nature , fig.12 . for this nonuniform friction case",
    ", @xmath80 behaves in a manner similar to the case of homogeneous system ( fig.7 ) .",
    "however , here the out of phase state has the lowest energy unlike in the homogeneous case . at @xmath143",
    "we have the largest contributing second peak of @xmath80 to @xmath79 at any nonzero temperature .",
    "these intra - well transitions responsible for sr are effectively supported by numerous inter - well transitions in the periodic potential system .",
    "since the system is asymmetric and the amplitude @xmath122 are large , at low temperatures the hysteresis loops are not perfectly elliptical .",
    "yet , it is possible to roughly calculate the average amplitude @xmath122 and phase lags @xmath123 of the system response at all temperatures . in fig.11 , @xmath122 and @xmath123",
    "are also plotted along with @xmath79 .",
    "it is clear from the figure that @xmath79 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 all peak almost at the same temperature .",
    "interestingly , the peak value of @xmath123 is about @xmath144 . for this system @xmath123 satisfies",
    "peaking criterion of sr stated using the linear response theory@xcite .",
    "however , magnitude wise the phase lag @xmath123 is off by about @xmath145 .",
    "a periodic potential system driven by a periodic applied field of small sub - threshold amplitude at a high frequency , close to the natural frequency of the periodic potential well bottoms , shows stochastic resonance . here the average input energy per period of the field is considered as the quantifier of sr .",
    "the same quantifier had served sr correctly in bistable systems . moreover ,",
    "the probability distribution of the input energy exhibits similar qualitative behaviour at sr as it shows in the bistable systems . the linear response theory calculated frequency dependent mobility was found to show exactly similar behaviour as the input energy and was previously termed as a mere dynamical resonance .",
    "it was argued that the period of the drive was too small compared to the kramers time of inter - well static potential barrier crossing , thus disqualifying the resonance behaviour from being a genuine stochastic resonance .",
    "however , we find that such an argument just does not hold because , in the dynamical situation , the inter - well transitions become quite numerous at the temperature where input energy peaks . moreover , and most importantly , the intra - well trajectories show bistability and the obtained resonance is a result of transition between these dynamical states effectively helped by inter - well transitions .",
    "there has been two rivalling sr criteria involving the phase lag between the response and the applied field : one@xcite stating that the phase lag shows inflection at sr with the phase lag equaling @xmath146 and the other@xcite that phase lag shows a peak at sr .",
    "we find that whereas the former criterion is only approximately satisfied in the uniform friction case , the latter is satisfied for the nonuniform friction case .",
    "thus , these criteria seem to be true for specific systems and hence the phase lag @xmath92 can not be taken as a universal quantifier such as the input energy for sr .",
