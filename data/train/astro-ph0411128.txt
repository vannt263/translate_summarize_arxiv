    "redshift surveys of the distant universe enable the study of the properties of galaxies at an earlier age , _ in situ_. large nearby galaxy surveys such as the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( colless et al.2001 ) and sloan digital sky survey ( abajazian et al .",
    "2003 ) are now completing the collection of huge samples to determine the structural and stellar - population parameters of local galaxies to high accuracy . at the same time , the development of more powerful multi - object spectrographs on large telescopes is allowing high - redshift surveys to collect truly large samples of distant galaxies , with numbers and detail useful for comparison to the nearby surveys .",
    "the deep extragalactic evolutionary probe ( deep ) is a series of large - scale galaxy redshift surveys aimed at studying the evolution of galaxies and large - scale structure to redshifts @xmath0 , roughly half the present age of the universe .",
    "the deep program is in two parts .",
    "the second part , deep2 , is a large survey of @xmath865,000 galaxies that is now ongoing with the deimos spectrograph on the keck 2 telescope .",
    "the present paper reports results from deep1 , an earlier , smaller pilot program using the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ) on keck 1 .",
    "the data reported here cover a subset of the hst groth survey strip ( gss ) , a mosaic of 28 hst wfpc2 pointings covering 127 arcmin@xmath9 on the sky in the  and filters ( groth et al .",
    "1994 ; rhodes , refregier & groth 2000 ) .",
    "hst photometry of the gss reaches to a depth of @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( 5@xmath12 ) .",
    "the construction of the spectroscopic sample is discussed in paper i ( vogt et al .",
    "2004 in preparation ) , and the measurement of photometric structural parameters is discussed in paper ii ( simard et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "we present a catalog containing 658 galaxy redshifts , with median @xmath13 , including 620 galaxies from our spectroscopy and 38 galaxies from other sources ( including 33 from the canada - france redshift survey , lilly et al .",
    "galaxies were selected generally to @xmath14 mag ( vega ) .",
    "we use this catalog to discuss the properties of galaxies and large - scale structure to @xmath0 , with particular focus on the bimodal distribution of properties of the distant galaxy population .",
    "this bimodality has been discovered recently for local galaxies in sloan digital sky survey data ( e.g. , strateva et al .  2001 , hogg et al .  2003 , kauffmann et al .  2003 ) and for distant galaxies to @xmath15 in the combo-17 photometric redshift survey ( bell et al .",
    "2003a , hereafter b03 ) . among local galaxies ,",
    "bimodality is evidenced by a fairly rapid change in galaxy properties near a stellar mass of @xmath16 m@xmath17 ( kauffmann et al .",
    "above that mass , galaxies are generally red with large spheroids ; below that , they are blue and disk - dominated .    an easy way to visualize the bimodality is in the color - magnitude diagram , which shows two separate color sequences , a broad blue sequence and a narrower red sequence offset to brighter magnitudes and higher masses .",
    "this is shown well , as a function of redshift , by b03 .",
    "we confirm their finding of a persistent bimodal distribution here and use the particular features of our data to further investigate the properties of both red and blue galaxies .",
    "two published redshift surveys that are comparable in size and depth to deep1/gss are the canada - france redshift survey ( cfrs , lilly et al .",
    "1995a ) and the caltech faint galaxy redshift survey ( cfgrs , cohen et al .",
    "the cfrs is a magnitude - limited survey to @xmath18 containing 591 galaxy redshifts with median @xmath19 ( crampton et al .",
    "cfrs is roughly 1.5 mag shallower than the nominal limit of deep1 , but the median redshifts are similar due to differences in the detailed sampling of the magnitude range and to difficulties in obtaining redshifts beyond @xmath20 ( see section [ sec - zfail ] ) .",
    "the cfrs is in several fields , one overlapping the groth strip .",
    "the spectral resolution is 40  ; a subsample of 246 objects have hst imaging , all with @xmath21 and many also with @xmath22 or @xmath23 ( brinchmann et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the major region surveyed by the cfgrs is the hst hubble deep field , where 602 galaxy redshifts are compiled to @xmath24 in the hdf and @xmath25 in the flanking fields ( cohen et al .",
    "the cfgrs combines redshifts from several authors ; most spectra were taken using the lris spectrograph ( oke et al .",
    "1995 ) , the same instrument used for deep1 .",
    "the typical spectral resolution is 10  , and the median redshift is about 0.7 .",
    "most galaxies have hst imaging , roughly one quarter being imaged deeply with multiple filters in the hdf , and three quarters imaged lightly in @xmath21 in the flanking fields .",
    "a third survey to which we will make repeated reference is the combo-17 photometric redshift survey , in four fields ( wolf et al .  2003 ; b03 ) . unlike traditional spectroscopic surveys , this program used intermediate - band photometry in 17 filters to measure restframe colors and redshifts accurate to @xmath26 for 25,000 galaxies from @xmath27 .",
    "recent papers have presented morphological results based on hst acs imaging of one of these fields , called gems ( rix et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the deep1 groth strip data have three distinguishing features compared to previous efforts .",
    "the spectral resolution is significantly higher , 2.9   ( fwhm ) in the blue and 4.2   in the red , yielding a typical velocity resolution of 160 @xmath28 .",
    "this is high enough for unambiguous identification of the  3727 doublet and to permit kinematic linewidth and rotation measurements , which will be presented in separate papers ( weiner et al .  in preparation ,",
    "vogt et al.in preparation ) .",
    "the second feature is hst imaging in both @xmath23 and @xmath21 filters , enabling measurement of uniform restframe colors and structural parameters for nearly all objects .",
    "the third feature is a single , nearly continuous field with long dimension 40  on the sky , or 38 comoving mpc at @xmath29 .",
    "these features , particularly the hst imaging , are central to our discussion .",
    "several papers related to the deep1 gss survey have already been published .",
    "koo et al .  ( 1996 ) presented a small number of early redshifts .",
    "vogt et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1997 ) presented the tully - fisher relation for a few resolved disk galaxies .",
    "simard et al .",
    "( 1999 ) measured the evolution of the size - luminosity relation , and simard et al .",
    "( 2002 ) measured the photometry and structural parameters used in this paper .",
    "of particular relevance is i m et al .  ( 2002 ) , who identified normal e / s0 galaxies to @xmath30 in the present redshift sample and observed that they populate a narrow color sequence in observed @xmath31 versus redshift .",
    "this was used to estimate photometric redshifts for a larger number of e / s0 galaxies without spectra , from which the luminosity function of early - type galaxies was computed .",
    "we confirm the narrow range in color of early - type galaxies here and extend the morphological conclusions of i m et al .",
    "( 2001 ) to fainter galaxies .",
    "all hst johnson - cousins magnitudes used in this paper are on the vega system .",
    "we use a @xmath32cdm cosmogony with @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "a series of spectroscopic samples was selected from a photometric catalog produced from hst  and  imaging , as described in paper i ( vogt et al .",
    "2004 in preparation ) .",
    "the limiting magnitude for most objects was @xmath14 , based on @xmath35 diameter aperture magnitudes .",
    "the different samples were designed to explore a range of scientific programs .",
    "in addition to a general magnitude limited sample , several types of objects were prioritized for selection from the photometric catalog .",
    "these included : elongated candidates for spatially resolved velocity profile extraction , morphologically peculiar objects , extremely blue or red galaxies ( @xmath36 or @xmath37 ) , and objects with photometric redshifts larger than @xmath38 .",
    "in addition to the primary targeted objects , we acquired and extracted spectra for objects which fell serendipitously within the slit , and stars placed on slitmasks purely for use in aligning the mask on the sky .",
    "the set of spectroscopic targets is therefore not a strictly random sampling of the photometric catalog . in practice , however , the observed objects sample the range of apparent color and magnitude in the photometric catalog fairly evenly in the range @xmath39 ( paper i , vogt et al .",
    "2004 in preparation ) . combining all objects placed within slits and the objects used for alignment purposes ,",
    "usable spectra were obtained for a total of 813 different objects .",
    "the spectra were taken with the lris spectrograph ( oke et al .",
    "1995 ) at the keck telescopes in successive spring seasons from 1995 through 1999 .",
    "observations were spread over nine observing runs and 25 nights , in conjunction with several other spring fields . in total",
    ", 36 slitmasks were observed in the gss , where each mask contained typically 30 to 50 slits and several alignment stars .",
    "the first set of ten masks was populated with targets by using printed images of the target fields and transparent overlays , while the rest were designed using interactive , computerized selection ; see vogt et al .",
    "( 2004 , in preparation ) .",
    "the number of objects per mask increased with time , as we determined the minimum slit length to obtain high quality background - subtracted spectra for objects of a given magnitude and color . following target and alignment star selection ,",
    "all masks were modeled with the ucsclris iraf package written by a.c .",
    "phillips to account for specific observational constraints ( e.g. , anamorphic corrections ) and to create instructions for milling the mask .",
    "nearly all masks were milled with slits of width @xmath40 , with a slit length ranging from @xmath41 to @xmath42 .",
    "after the first year , a small fraction of all slits was tilted at an angle ( between @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) relative to the position angle of the mask , in order to trace along the major axis of a spatially elongated object or to capture two objects within one slit .",
    "certain objects , typically those at magnitudes @xmath45 ; those with extremely red colors ; those for which a redshift could not be determined after initial observations ; and spatially extended objects requiring higher s / n , were placed on one , three , or ( rarely ) more additional slitmasks to obtain more exposure time .",
    "each mask was observed in turn with a blue ( typically 900 l  mm@xmath46/5500  ) and a red ( 600 l  mm@xmath46/7500  ) grating , for a combined spectrum covering the range 5000   to 8200  .",
    "we obtained a baseline of @xmath47 seconds exposure per grating per mask , and were able to keep the airmass below 1.3 .",
    "the spectral resolutions , measured by fitting multiple night sky oh lines in reduced , combined and extracted spectra , are @xmath48   in the blue spectra and 1.8   in the red spectra , or fwhm = 2.9 and 4.2 respectively .",
    "a matched flat fielding procedure was developed for the later data . at the end of the night ,",
    "the telescope was slewed to the same position and the spectrograph rotated to the same position angle as used for the nighttime data exposure .",
    "the grating tilt was iteratively adjusted to place a given wavelength at the same pixel as in the nighttime exposure , and then the flat field image was taken .",
    "this procedure reduced the effect of ccd fringing and improved the sky subtraction and data quality in the red portion of the spectrum , beyond 7000  .",
    "two programs , each crafted for 2-d multislit spectral reductions , were used to reduce these data .",
    "early masks were reduced using dan kelson s expector software ( kelson et al .",
    "later masks were reduced using the iraf redux package written by one of the authors [ acp ] .",
    "a few masks were reduced using both of these packages , yielding comparable results .",
    "both sets of software perform the same group of operations : bias subtraction and trimming of overscan region ; `` cosmic ray '' removal ; bad pixel replacement ; flat fielding ; removal of distortion in the spatial direction ; linearization in wavelength ; and correction for a `` slit function '' ( removal of the effects of non - uniform slit width ) .",
    "the primary difference between them is the manner in which calibrations ( slitlet location , wavelength ) are determined .",
    "expector requires the user to locate slit edges , but automates wavelength calibration , using a cross - correlation algorithm .",
    "a wavelength calibration is produced for each spatial position along each individual slitlet , using night sky lines and , if necessary , arc spectra in the blue , taken through each mask .",
    "redux performs its calibrations in a very different way .",
    "the program uses an optical model of the spectrograph consisting of three parts : ( 1 ) a mapping of mask location to grating input angles ; ( 2 ) a transform into and out of the grating coordinate system , where the grating equation is used to describe the dispersion and line - curvature ; and ( 3 ) a mapping of grating output angles to the detector .",
    "this reduces the effective unknowns to two for each mask : an error in the grating tilt and an error in the grating `` pitch . ''",
    "( a third grating variable , the rotation about the grating normal , is solved using arc spectra taken through a special mask and is assumed constant for a given observing run . )",
    "the software uses the model and the mask design to predict location of slit edges and bright night sky lines ; the offset in the slit locations and the night sky lines then provide the solution for the two unknown variables .",
    "the grating tilt error is calculated for each individual slitlet to provide more precise zero - points in wavelength .",
    "the location of each slitlet and the wavelength solution within each slitlet are then known to quite good precision for the entire image .",
    "both expector and redux have advantages and shortcomings .",
    "expector performs empirical calibrations for each mask using spectra taken through that mask , but when arcs are used the significant flexure in lris means that the calibrations may not be as accurate for the science data , and offsets must be added .",
    "in addition , sparse regions in the arc spectra ( typical in the blue ) cause uncertainties in the wavelength solution .",
    "redux , on the other hand , is limited by the precision of the optical model .",
    "using combined data sets with a variety of gratings and spanning large ranges in grating tilt , typical _ rms _ errors are @xmath80.6 px ( 0.13 arcsec spatially ; in dispersion , 0.51   and 0.77   in the blue and red , respectively ) , and the errors are rarely worse than @xmath811.5 px in the very corners of the image . for most science spectra ,",
    "the results are better than this , particularly as the wavelength scale is zero - pointed using night sky lines .",
    "fringing in the red has always been a difficult problem due to the strong night - sky lines in the oh `` forest '' . given the flexure in lris , it was often found that applying a `` fringe frame '' correction exacerbated the problem rather than reducing it .",
    "thus , in the earlier data , fringe frames were only employed if they improved night - sky subtraction .",
    "this problem was solved in later data by taking red flat - fields at the end of the night , matched in wavelength to the science image as described above . in these data ,",
    "fringe frame corrections were always applied and always produced good results .    individually - reduced",
    "2-d linearized and rectified spectral images for each object were collected for all observing runs and combined using a biweight estimator , resulting in two final combined 2-d images , one each for the red and blue gratings .",
    "one - dimensional spectra were then extracted from these combined images , with a minimum object width of 1.5 arcseconds .",
    "we inspected the 1-d and 2-d spectra by eye to find spectral features .",
    "for all candidate redshifts , we verified the existence of features by visual inspection and assigned a quality code .",
    "for galaxies at @xmath49 , the primary features are nebular emission lines , principally  3726 3729 , h@xmath50 4861 ,  4959 5007 , and h@xmath51 6563 ; for absorption - line objects the strongest features are ca ii h+k 3933 3969 , the ch g - band at 4304  , balmer lines , and the 4000   break .",
    "some high-@xmath52 objects are identified by interstellar absorption lines of mg ii 2796 2803 and fe ii 2586 2600 .",
    "cool , late type stars are generally identified by absorption bands ; hotter stars often have featureless spectra in our wavelength region and are more difficult to identify .",
    "we consider a redshift secure if at least two features are detected .",
    "since the spectral resolution is high , many galaxies have clearly resolved  doublet emission , which is counted as two features .",
    "objects with a secure redshift from two or more features are given a redshift quality a in column 5 of table [ table - catalog ] .",
    "some galaxies have a broad emission line consistent with the  doublet separation of 220 @xmath28 , but not resolved into two components .",
    "these galaxies have an almost certain redshift , since the appearance of broad  in the 2-d spectra is distinctive , and there is generally no other convincing candidate for the emission line .",
    "these and other objects with a nearly certain redshift but without two strong distinct features are `` almost secure '' and are given a quality b in column 5 of table [ table - catalog ] .    all redshifts were checked by at least two people ( phillips , sarajedini , koo , weiner ) and disagreements on redshift and quality were resolved .",
    "final redshift qualities were systematized by one of us ( bjw ) to assure uniformity .",
    "we estimate that quality a have @xmath53 confidence and quality b have @xmath54 confidence .",
    "our analysis of the galaxy sample below uses both the quality a and b objects .",
    "a few objects have a single feature , very weak features , or other spectral properties which suggest a redshift , but the redshift is by no means certain .",
    "we do not count these as identified or use these objects in the analysis of galaxy properties below .",
    "the uncertain redshifts are not listed in table [ table - catalog ] but can be retrieved from our web database .",
    "there are very few objects with a single strong spectral feature that yields an ambiguous redshift .",
    "objects for which a redshift , 136 in total , could not be determined with confidence are coded with quality f in column 5 of table [ table - catalog ] . these include objects with low signal - to - noise and objects with fairly high s / n but no identifiable features .",
    "a small number of objects , @xmath55 , fell off the slit , off the detector , or had otherwise unusable data ; these objects are not listed in table [ table - catalog ] and are not counted in our completeness statistics .",
    "lrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr    [ table - catalog ]     the high resolution of the lris spectra allowed us to determine redshifts to a few parts in @xmath56 .",
    "we quantified redshift accuracy by comparing to observations of the groth strip from the ongoing deep 2 survey with the deimos spectrograph , at even higher spectral resolution .",
    "the deep2 redshifts are known to be accurate to 30 @xmath28 . from 140 galaxies with both deep1 and deep2 redshifts",

    "@xmath28  and an rms @xmath58 @xmath28 .",

    "a portion of the redshift catalog is shown in table [ table - catalog ] .",

    "this is confirmed by subsequent deep2 observations , which are taken at higher spectral resolution , are less contaminated by oh emission , and reveal large numbers of galaxies beyond @xmath72 out to the deep2 redshift limit @xmath73 ; many of these occupy the region where deep1 failures lie . further information on blue redshift failures is provided by measurements probing the `` redshift desert '' by steidel et al .  ( 2004 ) , who show that many galaxies successfully recovered in the range @xmath74 display colors similar to the blue failures here .",

    "the spheroid - dominated category ( hereafter called srg , for  spheroidal red galaxy \" ) contains objects from e to sa .",

    "the edge - on class contains disky galaxies of all types that are highly inclined ; their inclination prevents a determination of specific hubble type .",
    "these objects are presumably reddened by dust , and several in fact show a dust lane .",
    "such galaxies are found on the red sequence locally ( see below ) , and their occurrence at high redshift is not remarkable .",
    "the third category , called difrg for  diffuse red galaxy , \" is the most interesting class .",
    "we adopted this term when it became apparent that a significant fraction of `` red smudgy '' objects lacked all trace of a spheroid , were not edge - on disks , and yet were still red . despite their redness , morphologically these objects resemble late - type spirals or magellanic irr i irregulars , though their absolute magnitudes are of course much brighter , and their colors differ from low - redshift irregulars , which are generally very blue .",
    "their central surface brightnesses are low compared to spheroids , and their light distributions are much less concentrated , hence the name `` diffuse . ''",
    "the difference between these objects and srgs is striking , as shown in figure [ fig - redimages ] .",
    "the division between srgs and difrgs is usually unambiguous , while edge - on galaxies are harder to categorize as concentrated or not , because of their orientation .",
    "a number of authors have also previously classified red galaxies into categories roughly corresponding to early and late - type , usually in the context of high - redshift extremely red objects ( eros ) ( moriondo et al .",

    "; yan & thompson 2003 ; moustakas et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "we found that galaxies could be classified into spheroids and non - spheroids , orthogonal to whether they were interacting or disturbed .",
    "we therefore defined a separate classification parameter largely based on asymmetry : in addition to the srg / disk / difrg categories above , each galaxy was also classified as  normal , \"  peculiar , \" or  interacting . \"",
    "normal objects are fairly axi - symmetric or possess normal - looking spiral arms . to be classed as interacting , an object must have a clearly discernible separate companion , and the isophotes of the main galaxy must also be disturbed ; plausible superpositions are classed as normal even though the companion may be very close .",
    "objects that are neither axi - symmetric nor interacting are called peculiar and are probably mostly late - stage mergers . of the 146 objects ,",
    "123 were normal , 20 peculiar , and only 3 were classified as interacting .",
    "none of the red galaxies had an interaction so profound that no srg / difrg type could be assigned , although a few such mergers are found among the blue galaxies .",

    "final classifications were made by bjw and cnaw , and independently by smf ; good agreement was found .",
    "our types also agree well those of i m et al .",
    "morphological classification over a wide range of redshifts can be affected by the redshifting of the bandpass ( `` morphological k - correction '' ) , since galaxies look clumpier at bluer wavelengths due to starforming regions ( e.g. , brinchmann et al . 1998 ) . however , our main goal is to sort spheroids from non - spheroids , not to make a detailed classification of later hubble types , where blue stars dominate .",
    "since hst @xmath61 remains fairly close to rest - frame @xmath22 out to @xmath0 , the k - correction relative to local spheroid hubble types should be small .",

    "the fraction which are spheroid - dominated does not differ significantly between low and higher redshift when the sample is split at @xmath130 .",
    "however , the edge - on disks tend to be found at lower redshift while the difrgs are mostly at higher redshift ; both effects are visible in figure [ fig - colormag ] .",
    "we argue below , from analyzing hubble types of local galaxies in the rc3 catalog , that the difrg class is an essentially new kind of object that does not appear in the local red population , but is found there at high redshift .",
    "it is therefore of interest to locate these objects in the cm diagram and chart their emergence versus redshift .",
    "figure [ fig - colormag ] shows color and symbol codes for the various morphological types of red galaxies .",

    "the first conclusion is that srgs and edge - on / sb s are well mixed in color at all redshifts , but there is a hint that difrgs may tend to be somewhat bluer , closer to the valley dividing the red galaxies from blue .",
    "this suggestion is confirmed by a study of valley galaxies just blueward of the dividing line , which contain yet more difrgs .",
    "the second conclusion is that difrgs seem to be more prevalent at high redshift and disappear with time : difrgs comprise 14% of red galaxies beyond @xmath131 but only 4.5% below @xmath131 .",
    "finally , the reverse effect is seen for edge - on / sb s , which comprise only 9% of red galaxies beyond @xmath131 yet make up 17% below @xmath131 . this effect for edge - ons may be a selection effect due to constraints from apparent size and surface brightness dimming , especially given their low surface brightnesses as shown in figure [ fig - colorsb ] .",

    "the percentage by number of classic early - type red galaxies in our sample is influenced by the intrinsic luminosities of the different morphological types .",
    "for example , if spheroidals are brighter than diffuse galaxies , their contribution by number in a magnitude - limited data set is magnified above the true ratio of number densities . however , their contribution to the true luminosity density is also higher than the ratio of number densities , and these effects offset .",
    "a simple @xmath132 estimation of the luminosity functions of the various red morphological classes yields an early - type e / s0/sa / srg percentage by number that is in general agreement with the e / s0 fraction derived by i m et al .",

    "further comparisons are beyond the scope of this paper , given small numbers and the possibility of unknown cosmic variance ( our sample is small , and combo-17 s narrow redshift range contains a large - scale - structure peak ) .",
    "we also agree with combo-17 that many of the dust - reddened galaxies are edge - on disks , and that the red population at @xmath130 is not dominated by mergers or dust - enshrouded starbursts .",

    "bell et al .",
    "( 2003b ) did not note the existence of difrg galaxies as a separate class , but this could be due to their focus on the narrow redshift interval 0.65 - 0.75 ; by that epoch , most difrgs have disappeared from our sample .",

    "these studies classified eros into early - type ( spheroidal or non - starforming ) and non - early - type using various combinations of visual morphology ( spheroid / disk / other ) , sersic index or concentration , and line emission .",
    "we show here and below that the division of red galaxies into spheroidal versus difrgs and edge - on disks is correlated with all these properties , and surface brightness as well .",

    "these are bulges in the traditional sense : spheroids with old stellar populations .",
    "disk components bluer than the bulges imply a radial color gradient in the sense that the outer parts are bluer , in agreement with local early - type galaxies .",

    "the behavior of blue galaxies is opposite .",
    "most of the `` bulges '' in these systems are quite blue , with mean color @xmath156 , which corresponds to vigorous star formation .",
    "furthermore , figure [ fig - buldiskcolor ] shows that blue central components are systematically _ bluer _ than their outer disks .",
    "both facts support the notion that blue galaxies with blue `` bulges '' are actually hosting central regions that are actively forming young stars .",
    "for example , the distant compact narrow emission - line galaxies of guzman et al .",
    "( 1998 ) tend to have a high bulge fraction , but colors and @xmath157 indicating a central starburst .    a final fact , noted by koo et al .  ( 2004 ) and visible in figure [ fig - buldiskcolor ] ,",
    "is that even the brightest blue `` bulges '' are actually about 1 magnitude dimmer than red bulges . since a stellar population both fades and reddens as it ages , these blue centers _ can not _ be the progenitors of the observed red @xmath143 bulges ; they are too faint .",
    "if after fading , the blue center will deviate from local relations for luminous early - type bulges , then it can not be a proto - luminous _ bulge _ , though it could perhaps produce a fainter or exponential bulge as found in nearby late type galaxies . because we do not find any sufficiently bright concentrated blue sources , and few of intermediate color , we conclude that either the observed red bulges formed well before @xmath109 ( see also abraham et al .",
    "1999 ) , or that massive bulge formation involves growth of mass by mergers after @xmath29 , or that massive bulge formation below @xmath109 is happening in sites of highly obscured star formation .",
    "these conclusions for red bulges parallel the conclusions on the formation of entire gaalxies in the red population reached by b03 .",
    "most evidence up to this point indicates that , to first order , the distant red and blue populations are composed of galaxies that broadly resemble their low-@xmath52 counterparts .",
    "we might therefore also expect to find a strong trend between restframe color and star - formation rate , as seen in local galaxies .",
    "this is confirmed in figure [ fig - colorew ] , which shows the log restframe equivalent width ( ew ) of each galaxy s strongest emission line plotted against galaxy color .",
    "the strongest line is usually  6563 at very low @xmath52 ,  5007 at @xmath158 , and  3727 at @xmath159 .",
    "strength has been defined here as highest intensity in dn units , not in ew , although the two are closely related .",

    "the median ew of diffuse red galaxies is four times higher than that of spheroidal red galaxies , confirming the impression seen in figure [ fig - colorew ] .",
    "the difrgs are bluer than the srgs , so can be expected to have higher emission given the color - ew relation , but figure [ fig - colorew ] suggests that the difrgs also lie at higher ew than the mean relation .",
    "the median ew of difrgs is high enough to indicate reasonably active star formation .",
    "we conclude that difrgs are not dominated by old stellar populations , and are reddened mainly by dust . however , since they do not have the characteristic appearance of the edge - on disks , they are a distinct , new class .",
    "we have seen that the red population contains a fair range of morphologies .",
    "most objects are morphologically similar to nearby early types from e to sa , but dust - reddened , irregular , and interacting objects can also fall on the red side of the color bimodality .",
    "this range of morphology could produce scatter in other properties , such as color .",
    "red - sequence cluster galaxies generally fall on a tight color - magnitude relation ( cmr ) , both locally ( bower et al .",
    "1992 ) and at high redshift ( van dokkum et al .",
    "it is clear from figure [ fig - colormag ] that our sample of red field galaxies does not obey a perfectly narrow color - magnitude relation , nor does it have an obvious slope .",
    "however , measuring the slope and scatter are not easy because the distribution of galaxies about the red sequence is asymmetric . on the blue side of the peak , the distribution of points blends into the red wing of blue galaxies , and",
    "the presence of these objects will increase the apparent scatter of the red sequence per se unless these objects are allowed for or the sample is truncated .",
    "b03 dealt with this by assuming a fixed cmr slope , truncating the sample to @xmath160 , and calculating a robust biweight estimator ( beers et al .",
    "1990 ) of the evolving cmr zeropoint and the scatter on the red sequence .",
    "they found a gaussian scatter on the red sequence of 0.15 mag in @xmath161 rest , or 0.09 mag transformed to @xmath6 rest , which they attributed largely to photometric redshift error .",
    "if the cmr zeropoint evolution were not subtracted , the scatter would increase only marginally to @xmath162 mag in @xmath6 .",
    "we carried out a similar calculation by truncating our sample to @xmath163 , the trough of the color distribution , and computing the biweight scatter .",
    "we find a scatter of 0.116 mag .",
    "this number changes only slightly to 0.112 mag when we exclude the @xmath164 objects with poorer k - correction , and does not change if we subtract a cmr slope in @xmath6 of 0.04 ( van dokkum et al.2000 ) .",
    "the scatter in @xmath6 for only spheroidal morphological types is nearly as large , 0.108 mag , and is reduced only to 0.100 mag when @xmath164 objects are excluded ; subtracting a cmr slope again does not change the scatter .",
    "our cmr scatter is therefore comparable to that of b03 . while our k - corrections are less accurate since we have fewer filters , we eliminate the errors due to scatter in photometric redshifts .",
    "the derived scatter is large compared to the known sources of error , which were enumerated in section [ sec - colors ] .",
    "median errors of measurement in @xmath31 are only 0.055 mag , which converts to 0.03 - 0.04 mag in @xmath6 for a typical galaxy in the range @xmath165 - 1.0 . correcting the raw scatter of 0.112 mag for this",
    "observational error yields a net true scatter of 0.105 mag .",
    "the other potential source of error is the k - correction in converting apparent @xmath31 to restframe @xmath6 .",

    "plotting them side - by - side highlights the color evolution that has occurred in galaxies since @xmath180 , which is also shown in figure [ fig - ubhist ] .",
    "the peak of the red population has shifted redward with time by about 0.11 mag in @xmath6 , the valley has moved by the same amount , and the blue peak has shifted by about 0.24 mag .",
    "selection effects cause faint galaxies to be missing from both distant and local samples , although the effects act in the same direction in both samples . comparing",
    "the distribution of points and the color histograms of figure [ fig - ubhist ] suggests that the rc3 sample of blue galaxies is more heavily weighted toward brighter ( thus redder ) galaxies than the deep sample , which exaggerates the evolution .",
    "the color evolution of blue galaxies can be measured more reliably with better local samples , and with larger distant samples which measure evolution internal to the samples , from combo-17 and from deep2 ( willmer et al .",
    "2004 , in preparation ) .    our color evolution of 0.11 mag in @xmath6 for the red population , from its median redshift of 0.8 to now , can be compared to the color evolution of red sequence galaxies measured by b03 .",
    "their figure 2 shows an evolution from @xmath95 to 0.25 of 0.26 mag in @xmath161 , and extrapolates to 0.35 mag to @xmath125 , corresponding to 0.16 and 0.22 mag in @xmath6 respectively .",
    "both numbers are larger than what we find .",
    "however , figure 2 of b03 also shows that their red galaxies at @xmath181 are _ already redder _ than the colors of local galaxies from sdss .",
    "in contrast , the color evolution from the combo-17 red galaxies at @xmath95 to sdss galaxies at @xmath182 is only 0.15 mag in @xmath161 directly , or 0.1 mag converted to @xmath6 , which agrees with our result .",
    "b03 noted that aperture effects may have caused their low - redshift galaxy colors to be too red , which could explain the difference .",
    "the color evolution that we find is consistent with the small color evolution found by gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and by koo et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and is only half that predicted by passive evolution models with @xmath183 . the amount of color evolution in red galaxies is critical in determining their stellar population histories and the amount of mass buildup on the red sequence .",
    "these questions will be addressed with larger samples and better restframe colors in future deep2 papers .",
    "figure [ fig - colormagrc3](a ) shows hubble types for rc3 galaxies .",
    "the rc3 red sequence is composed mainly of e and s0 galaxies , while sa galaxies are centered on the valley between the peaks .",
    "the local population redder than the valley minimum therefore contains mostly hubble types e to s0 , with a smattering of sa s .",
    "this resembles the makeup of the distant red population , which consists mainly ( 75% ) of spheroid - dominated srgs ( section [ sec - morphology ] , also bell et al .",
    "2003b ) .",
    "however , roughly 25% of our distant red galaxies are _ not _ typed as srgs . of these , nearly all are either edge - on disks ( some of which may be srgs ) or are difrgs . we have examined the rc3 sample to see if such objects are present on the local red sequence as well .",
    "a small contaminating population of intermediate hubble types ( sab to sc ) is indeed found , at the few percent level , and most of these interlopers are edge - on or close to it and are likely reddened by dust . these are presumably the analogs of our distant edge - on galaxies .",
    "the number of these edge - on middle hubble types is about the same in both the deep1 and rc3 samples as a fraction of the blue galaxy population .",
    "the difrgs are another matter .",
    "we have seen that they tend to populate the valley between the red and blue population , the region that locally is occupied by sa s .",
    "however , difrgs structurally do not resemble sa s , because they completely lack a large spheroid .",
    "the most plausible local analogs to difrgs in structure are types sc and later .",
    "but there are only three sc s on the entire rc3 subsample red sequence ( out of 517 galaxies ) , and all three are edge on and dust - reddened .",
    "difrgs , we have noted , are distinct from classic edge - on disks , because they are not as flattened .",
    "the most plausible local red - sequence analog to difrgs is perhaps the dusty , irregular starburst galaxy m82 , which has @xmath184 and whose light is not strongly concentrated in the @xmath22-band ( although it is more concentrated in @xmath5 images ) .",
    "m82 itself is highly inclined but is likely to be reddened even if not viewed edge - on .",
    "other than m82 , there do not seem to be common local red - sequence analogs to distant difrgs , which is consistent with their apparent disappearance at low redshift in our sample , as noted in section [ sec - morphology ] . it _ is _ possible that difrg analogs could exist locally at the _ same color _ as high - z difrgs , @xmath185 . in that case",
    "they would not be on the local red sequence , but would be a minority within the red edge of the blue population , which is mostly disk galaxies with bulges in the rc3 sample .",
    "thus , both the nature of high - z difrgs and what they evolve into remain unclear .",
    "the next point to examine is the color scatter of galaxies about the rc3 red sequence . applying the same method used in section 5.8 to reject outliers",
    ", we find that the biweight scatter about the red peak is 0.10 mag in @xmath6 for all galaxies with @xmath186 , if no cm relation is subtracted , and decreases insignificantly when a cm relation of slope 0.025 is subtracted and the sample is cut by a line 0.25 mag blueward of the cm relation . to parallel the treatment of the distant samples , all hubble types",
    "are included , and no corrections for internal reddening have been made .",
    "this rc3 scatter is essentially the same as the 0.11 mag we find for the gss galaxies ( with no cm relation subtracted ) , and the 0.09 mag found by b03 ( with an evolving cm relation subtracted ) .",
    "we conclude that an rms scatter in @xmath6 of @xmath187 mag typifies field red - sequence galaxies at _ all _ redshifts below @xmath0 .",
    "this is significantly larger than the scatter of 0.03 - 0.04 found for red , early - type cluster galaxies , both near and far ( e.g. , bower et al .  1992 ; van dokkum et al .",
    "2000 ) .    finally , the reader may have noticed that the number of red galaxies relative to blue galaxies is only about half as large in the gss cm diagram as that in the rc3 .",
    "one factor that discriminates against distant red galaxies is the r - band selection limit , shown in figure [ fig - colormag ] , which preferentially selects against red galaxies at high redshift . on the other hand ,",
    "a real increase in the number of red galaxies with time would be consistent with the increase in total red _ stellar mass _ reported by b03 below @xmath29 .",
    "this topic is discussed further in willmer et al .",
    "( 2004 , in preparation ) , where we derive luminosity functions from deep samples .",
    "the deep1 survey of the groth strip provides redshifts and spectra for over 600 galaxies out to @xmath108 , with hst / wfpc2 imaging in two filters ; the median redshift is @xmath1 .",
    "large scale structure walls are visible in the space distribution to @xmath108 .",
    "the deep1 galaxy sample shows a bimodality in the color - magnitude diagram similar to that found locally in the sdss ( blanton et al .",
    "2003 ; kauffmann et al .",
    "2003 ) and to @xmath0 in combo-17 ( b03 ) .",
    "the brightest red galaxies are somewhat more luminous than the brightest blue galaxies , so that the observed blue galaxies can not fade to produce the brightest red galaxies , as discussed by b03 .",
    "this difference between the most luminous red and blue galaxies is even stronger in terms of stellar mass , as shown in figure [ fig - colormass ] .",
    "the processes of star formation , quenching , and mass assembly in red galaxies will be studied at greater length in future surveys , including deep2 measurements of the luminosity function ( willmer et al .",
    "2004 , in preparation ) .",
    "the present sample does not permit a measurement of the red galaxy color - magnitude relation slope , but we can measure the scatter in color of distant red field galaxies .",
    "we find a scatter of 0.11 mag in restframe @xmath6 , even if only spheroidal types are included .",
    "this scatter is comparable to that found in combo-17 ( b03 ) , and in a sample of red galaxies selected from the rc3 , but larger than found in local or high - redshift early - type _ cluster",
    "_ galaxies ( bower et al .  1992 ; van dokkum et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "deep1 galaxies have structural measurements from hst imaging of the groth strip ( simard et al .",
    "red galaxies are generally more centrally concentrated than blue galaxies , as found at low redshift in the sdss ( blanton et al .",
    "the bulk of red galaxies have red stellar bulges , while blue galaxies generally have exponential profiles .",
    "red bulges are brighter than blue starforming centers , so that the same problem of progenitors occurs for red bulges as for red galaxies in toto .",
    "we have classified red galaxies into three main groups : spheroidal red galaxies ( srgs ) , edge - on disks , and diffuse red galaxies ( difrgs ) .",
    "these classifications correlate well with objective measures of central concentration .",
    "the srgs include objects which resemble local spheroid - dominated galaxies of type e , s0 and sa ; these are presumably red due to old , metal - rich stellar populations .",
    "the edge - on disks are presumably reddened by dust .",
    "the difrgs are the most puzzling category : these do not have a strong central concentration , are not edge - on , and resemble local diffuse galaxies such as magellanic irregulars , but of course are both more luminous and redder .",
    "they are not obviously interacting or merging .",
    "our measurements of line emission from the difrgs indicate that they are star - forming and likely reddened by dust rather than old stellar populations . based on an examination of red galaxies in a local sample drawn from the rc3",
    ", there is no common type of local red galaxy with morphology similar to the difrgs ; m82 may be the best analog .",
    "the gems survey of red galaxy morphologies at @xmath133 did not note difrgs as a class ( bell et al .",
    "2003b ) , but this may be influenced by the relatively low redshift range studied .",
    "the difrgs in the deep1 sample are all at @xmath188 , above the median redshift of our survey , suggesting that difrgs are more common at high redshift . studies of extremely red objects ( eros ) in the goods - s field indeed find fewer spheroidals and a larger fraction of irregular and `` other '' types at @xmath189 ( moustakas et al .",
    "if in fact difrgs are similar to dusty eros , they provide an opportunity to study the ero phenomenon at lower redshifts , where nebular features are accessible to optical spectroscopy .",
    "this paper has focused mainly on the properties of distant red - population galaxies .",
    "principal unanswered questions concerning them are the color evolution of red galaxies , the manner in which galaxies evolve onto the red sequence , how their numbers and total stellar mass change with time , and the nature of diffuse red galaxies and their descendants .",
    "though blue galaxies are not highlighted here , the evolution in their properties may be even greater than that of red galaxies , given their color evolution .",
    "a worthy project for the future will be correlating the color evolution of blue galaxies with other properties such as mass , star formation rate , and structure , and studying the entire suite of properties as a function of location in the color - magnitude diagram .",
