    "the connection between accretion flow parameters and radio jet production is a mysterious one .",
    "it has been argued in @xcite that the jet kinetic luminosity , @xmath6 , is correlated with the bolometric luminosity of the thermal emission , @xmath4 , produced by the accretion flow in blazar type agn .",
    "however , using virtually identical techniques as @xcite , @xcite came to the opposite conclusion . in order to shed some light on this issue",
    ", we explore this question from a different perspective for the particular case of quasars .",
    "the vast majority ( @xmath7 ) of quasars are radio quiet whether their @xmath4 lies just above the seyfert 1/ quasar dividing line or if they are at the other extreme , @xmath8 .",
    "this observation indicates that there are additional parameters , beyond @xmath4 that @xmath5 , that control the power of the radio jet .",
    "we note that the very high @xmath6 , frii radio source , cygnus a , @xmath9 ( according to ( 1.1 ) of this article ) , harbors a hidden quasar with @xmath4 just above the seyfert 1/ quasar dividing line and has a low eddington rate , the ratio of @xmath4 to the eddington accretion rate , @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "cygnus a is an extremely powerful fr ii radio source even when compared with low frequency selected samples at high redshift @xcite .",
    "it has two orders of magnitude higher @xmath6 than most fr ii quasars ( see chapter 10 of @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "thus , cygnus a provides a well studied `` standard '' candle for an extremely powerful fr ii source .",
    "this motivated us to explore the opposite extreme in the quasar family , the very powerful quasar pks  0743@xmath067 , which is luminous in all frequency bands and seemed to be a likely candidate for extremely high @xmath6 jets . in sections 3 and 4 ,",
    "it is shown that it has a has a powerful accretion luminosity , @xmath11 , @xmath3 , a strong unresolved vlbi radio core and prominent radio lobes . even though the quasar is at a redshift of @xmath12 @xcite , both the radio core and the radio lobe flux densities are @xmath13 .    in section 5",
    ", it is demonstrated that the high @xmath6 for these two extreme ends of the quasar range , cygnus a and pks 0743 - 067 , are not out of line with the properties of the quasar population as a whole . by studying a sample of quasars from @xcite",
    ", we find that @xmath6 is not correlated with @xmath4 for radio loud quasars that possess blazar cores .",
    "secondly , we demonstrate that the inverse correlation claimed between @xmath14 and @xmath5 in @xcite , although true , is a trivial consequence of the fact that @xmath6 is not correlated with @xmath4 in quasars .",
    "the primary conclusion of this study is that the intrinsic power of a quasar jet is not , to first order , controlled by the accretion rate .",
    "we have performed deep radio observations with the australia telescope national facility ( atca ) in order to understand the radio structure of pks  0743@xmath0673 ; the lobe emission alone would qualify it for the 3c catalogue if the source were in the northern hemisphere , our observations indicate that the jet kinetic luminosity , @xmath6 , is far more powerful than that in cygnus a.",
    "previously , @xcite imaged the radio structure of pks  0743@xmath0673 at 4.8 ghz with the atca .",
    "we performed deep observations at 2.496 , 4.800 and 8.640 ghz in order to image the source structure and obtain higher resolution as well as spectral and polarization data .",
    "it is essential to obtain both higher resolution and accurate spectral data to assess the energy content of the extended structure .",
    "our 8.640 ghz map is shown in figure 1 .",
    "1.1 '' at a position angle of @xmath15 .",
    "contour levels for the stokes i emission are 0.0125 jy / beam @xmath16 ( @xmath17 , 0.125 , 0.25 , 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , 32 , 64 ) .",
    "the peak fractional polarization is 52.1% .",
    "the vector lengths represent the electric field with 25.4% fractional polarization per arcsecond .",
    "the beam ellipse is plotted in the lower left hand corner of the figure ]    the data from our atca observations are presented in table 1 .",
    "quasars with a strong flat spectrum core often have doppler enhanced kpc scale jets @xcite .",
    "thus , an estimate of @xmath6 in pks  0743@xmath067 requires an analysis of the data in table 1 in order to determine if the jet and lobe emission to the east of the nucleus is doppler enhanced or not .",
    "the components e1 , e2 , e3 denote the eastern jet / lobe components in figure 1 , numbered consecutively from west to east .",
    ".atca radio data for pks  0743@xmath0673 .",
    "column 1 : @xmath18 , radio frequency .",
    "column 2 : component identification from figure 1 .",
    "column 3 : @xmath19 , total flux density at @xmath18 .",
    "column 4 : @xmath20 , percentage polarization at @xmath18 .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      +    in figure 1 , the magnetic field ( perpendicular to the electric field vectors plotted ) at the core is parallel to the jet direction and remains parallel to the jet direction along the length of the jet , even though the eastern jet goes through a large apparent bend . at the end of the eastern jet , the magnetic field switches to being perpendicular to the jet direction , typical of a radio galaxy hot spot .",
    "in order to avoid the ambiguities associated with doppler enhancement , we estimate the jet kinetic luminosity from the isotropic extended emission , applying a method that allows one to convert 151 mhz flux densities , @xmath23 , measured in jy , into estimates of kinetic luminosity , @xmath6 , from @xcite by means of the formula derived in @xcite : @xmath24^{\\frac{6}{7}}\\mathrm{ergs / sec}\\;,\\\\ & & z \\equiv 3.31-(3.65 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times\\left(\\left[(1+z)^{4}-0.203(1+z)^{3}+0.749(1+z)^{2 } + 0.444(1+z)+0.205\\right]^{-0.125}\\right)\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the total optically thin flux density from the lobes ( i.e. , no contribution from doppler boosted jets or radio cores ) .",
    "we assume a cosmology with @xmath25=70 km / s / mpc , @xmath26 and @xmath27 . in order to implement this technique",
    ", one needs to determine which components are optically thin and which are doppler enhanced .",
    "there are two possible interpretations of the data that one can use to calculate @xmath6 .",
    "the most straightforward approach is to note that all of the emission is optically thin and the large angular size of the source , @xmath28 , argues against significant doppler enhancement of the large - scale structures .",
    "however , we choose the most conservative approach : assume that all of the eastern emission is part of a jetted system and it is all doppler enhanced , even the hot spot to some extent ( this would explain why the eastern hot spot is more luminous than the western hot spot ) . if the source were symmetric and viewed in the sky plane then an upper limit to the total flux would be twice the observed flux from the western hotspot , 340 mjy at 2.496 ghz .",
    "extrapolating this to 151 mhz , yields a lobe flux of 8.8 jy . inserting this value into ( 3.1 ) yields @xmath29 ergs / sec .",
    "this equates to 2.5 times the kinetic luminosity of cygnus a computed by the same method .",
    "if the eastern lobe is not doppler enhanced then the kinetic luminosity is even larger .",
    "we note that no 151 mhz observations of pks  0743@xmath0673 have been made . however , @xcite measured the total flux density at 408 mhz to be 8.6 jy .",
    "this measurement will be dominated by the extended emission of the source , making an estimate of 8.8 jy at 151 mhz for the unbeamed emission conservative .",
    "a 2.3 ghz vlbi measurement of pks 0743 - 67 was made in @xcite . a secondary unresolved radio structure , presumably a strong knot in a jet ,",
    "is directed to the east of the core towards the base of the kpc jet seen in figure 1 .",
    "the vlbi emission is dominated by an unresolved core on the 10 milliarcsecond scale with 1.2 jy .",
    "not only is the time averaged @xmath6 from pks 0743 - 67 enormous , but the powerful parsec scale core indicates that the source is still likely to be highly energetic at the current time .",
    "one can estimate @xmath4 as in @xcite , @xmath30 , a method that has been applied to both radio quiet and radio loud quasars .",
    "we apply this formula to the flux density at @xmath31 from the spectrum of pks 0743 - 67 in @xcite , yielding @xmath32 .",
    "when making an estimate of the accretion flow luminosity , the strong radio core might raise some concern about contamination of the optical emission via a high frequency synchrotron spectrum associated with the base of the jet .",
    "thus , alternatively , one could get an estimate of @xmath4 using the method of @xcite that depends on line luminosity . following the discussion in section 3 of @xcite ,",
    "the civ / ly@xmath21 line strength ratio of the composite quasar spectra in @xcite , and eqn(1 ) of @xcite implies that the total broad line luminosity is @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the civ line strength .",
    "secondly , @xcite estimate @xmath35 , thus @xmath36 . using the civ line strength from @xcite",
    "this implies @xmath37 , in close agreement with the estimate above from the spectrum directly .",
    "one can estimate @xmath5 using the @xmath4 value above in conjunction with a mass estimate of the black hole mass , @xmath38 , from the same civ emission line .",
    "the estimator of @xmath38 of @xcite requires the luminosity at @xmath39 , @xmath40 . to be consistent with the philosophy of not using the continuum spectrum , one can instead estimate @xmath40 from the @xmath4 that is derived from the civ line strength above with the aid of the relation from @xcite , @xmath41 and assuming a typical quasar optical spectral index of 0.7 as was done in @xcite ( the spectrum in @xcite yields a similar value , 0.75 ) .",
    "one finds a central black hole mass of @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "one can check this result independently using the h@xmath21 line of pks 0743 - 67 measured in @xcite and the estimators in @xcite , @xmath44 and @xmath45 . converting the line luminosity to @xmath4 as for the civ estimate above ,",
    "one finds @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "ostensibly , the existence of a high @xmath5 and high @xmath6 source such as 0743 - 67 appears at odds with the result of @xcite , @xmath14 is inversely correlated with @xmath5 .",
    "the large q of cygnus a appears at odds with the other conclusion of @xcite , q is positively correlated with @xmath4 .",
    "however , closer inspection of the raw data used in @xcite indicates that this is not actually the case .",
    "the virtue of the estimates in @xcite is that they use the parsec scale jet emission to estimate @xmath6 contemporaneously with the estimate of @xmath4 .",
    "however , we warn the reader that such estimates are very sensitive to the uncertain doppler factor .",
    "the method that @xcite adopted from @xcite assumes that the x - ray energy emission is from synchrotron self compton emission ( ssc ) , however @xcite showed that external compton ( ecs ) scattering of quasar disk photons or broad line region photons by energetic particles in the jet will usually dominate the high energy quasar spectrum , since ecs emission is enhanced by the jet lorentz factor to the sixth power .",
    "this type of estimator can lead to enormous errors in the estimated values of @xmath6 . as an example , @xcite estimate for 4c 52.27 ( 1317 + 520 ) , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the kinetic luminosity of cygnus a. by contrast , using the radio maps in @xcite and the isotropic estimator in ( 3.1 ) , we find a more reasonable value of @xmath50 .",
    "first of all , @xcite present data in their log - log plot in figure 1a indicating that @xmath4 and @xmath6 have a strong linear correlation ( note that they assume that @xmath51 ) .",
    "however , if one removes the bl - lacs from the sample and fit a line to just the quasars on a log - log plot that is otherwise identical to figure 1a of @xcite then the squared multiple regression correlation coefficient , @xmath52 . if one removes the extreme estimate associated 4c 52.27 that was given above",
    ", the linear fit is even worse , @xmath53 and this result is displayed in figure 2a .",
    "this corresponds to a correlation coefficient , @xmath54 and the probability of getting this by chance is @xmath55 .",
    "the data in figure 2 is lifted directly from @xcite , so all the estimates are identical .",
    "the data of @xcite actually shows that @xmath6 and @xmath4 are very weakly correlated in quasars .",
    "the other result of @xcite that @xmath14 and @xmath5 are inversely correlated actually follows trivially as a consequence of the fact that @xmath6 is uncorrelated with @xmath4 for quasars and @xmath5 is strongly correlated with @xmath4 .",
    "this latter correlation is not surprising ; it is the strongest correlation amongst quasar parameters in @xcite , the best linear fit is @xmath56 + 47.121 $ ] ( see figure 2b ) .",
    "the correlation coefficient is @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "since @xmath6 is uncorrelated with @xmath4 , it follows that @xmath59 ( where we have introduced the symbol @xmath60 to represent correlation ) and @xmath61 from figure 2b . combining the two relations",
    ", it follows that @xmath62 , i.e. , @xmath14 and @xmath5 are inversely correlated as shown in figure 2c .",
    "the best linear fit is @xmath63=-0.814\\log[l_{bol}/l_{edd}]-0.673 $ ] and the correlation coefficient for @xmath5 and @xmath14 is @xmath64 for the subsample of quasars , with @xmath65 .",
    "the anti - correlation of @xmath5 and @xmath14 is spurious : there is no direct causal link between the these two variables as expressed statistically by small value of the partial correlation coefficient of @xmath14 versus @xmath5 with @xmath4 held fixed , -0.030 .",
    "finally , we note that this result does not imply that there is the potentially interesting correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath5 as evidenced by figure 2d .",
    "the correlation is very weak , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "pks  0743@xmath067 is an example of a quasar that has an ultra - luminous accretion flow , @xmath68 , a very high eddington rate , @xmath3 with @xmath69 , and is presently active as evidenced by the powerful unresolved vlbi radio core .",
    "by contrast , the high @xmath6 source cygnus a lies at the low end of the quasar range of @xmath4 and has a small @xmath5 and is also presently active as evidenced by the jet extending from the lobes to within a few light years of the central black hole ( see figure 1.10 of @xcite ) . using a large sample of quasars in figure 2 , it was shown that @xmath4 is uncorrelated with @xmath6 . hence , the diverse values of @xmath14 in cygnus a and pks 0743 - 67 should not be unexpected .",
    "it appears that to first order , the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath4 are unrelated to the intrinsic quasar jet power .",
    "this is consistent with the observation that @xmath70 of quasars are radio quiet , from the most luminous quasars down to the quasar / sevfert 1 dividing line .",
    "consider the wide range of @xmath4 in quasars that are associated with very powerful jets .",
    "it is argued in @xcite and @xcite that a significant large scale magnetic flux near a rapidly spinning black hole is the missing ingredient and is the primary determinant of frii quasar jet power , not the accretion flow .",
