    "with the increasing number of vital life loses in accidents , india is one of the most accident prone country , where according to the ncrb report 135,000 died in 2013 and property damage of $ 20 billion @xcite .",
    "many a time , accidents and unusual traffic congestion take place due to careless and impatient nature of drivers . in most cases",
    "drivers do nt follow lane rules , traffic rules leading to traffic congestion and accidents . for counter measuring all these problems , advanced driver assistance system is needed that can assist people drive safely or drive itself safely in case of autonomous driving cars .",
    "it is quite a challenge to make autonomous car that can self - sense the environment and drive like an aware human . in some recent works",
    "researchers have developed autonomous car , even though it s not still deployable in real life .",
    "in developed countries such as u.s.a and germany , with the gradual emergence of autonomous driving research , efforts are on to build a smart driving system that can drive more safely without any fatigue , as compared to humans can be programmed to follow traffic rules . in this context",
    "the main challenge involves understanding complex traffic patterns and taking real time decision on the basis of visual data from camera and laser sensors . for these automatic cars ,",
    "modelling vehicle current lane with respect to the road environment is very relevant for accurate driving , maintaining correct lane and keeping track of front vehicles .",
    "apart from this estimating departure angle from the current lane for possible overtaking and taking turn in curved road is also important . fig .",
    "[ fig : intro ] shows a sample vehicle lane detection scenario .    whether automatic cars will become a future reality or not , advanced driver assistance systems ( adas )",
    "are increasingly deployed in modern cars .",
    "road lane , road boundary and departure angle estimation are crucial modules of adas .",
    "such modules facilitate and validate human judgment .",
    "they can also be used to prepare the automobile in case of an emergency situation . in this work ,",
    "we have developed a robust lane detection system using a modified inverse perspective mapping ( ipm ) algorithm where camera intrinsic parameters are not required .",
    "this ipm formulation can give up to 45 m of accurate road view . by using ipm a wide area of unwanted region",
    "is removed and this will help to locate lane features accurately . also a novel lane departure warning system is developed .",
    "in addition to that another contribution of our method is that it can detect road boundary lane even if there are no lane marking , suitable for developing countries context .",
    "for this purpose wide angle camera sensor mounted on car roof was used to capture surrounding road environment .",
    "rest of the paper is organised as follows , section ii describes related literature . in section iii elaborate detection of lane and computation of departure angle method , and in section",
    "iv our experimental setup .",
    "finally we conclude in section v.",
    "the related literature on autonomous driving and advanced driving assistance system are based on using single or multiple camera facing the road to detect lane feature .",
    "sensors specifically lidar , radar etc .",
    "are used for detecting object and 3d modelling of the road environment . also in some works driver behaviour understanding using a camera facing the driver",
    "is used for drowsiness , sleepiness , and fatigue detection .    for lane detection and departure warning system",
    "many works target urban and countryside area @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "most of these works have used image processing and machine learning based approach for defining and extracting features for lanes . some of the works have straight and planer road assumption and only works in highway .",
    "this happens because of assumption of strong lane marking and low traffics . in",
    "lane tracking kalman filter and particle filter [ 8 ] based approach is used .",
    "another work based on vanishing point detection [ 9 ] gives a good result in countryside road .",
    "other related works include methods for road segmentation , traffic signs detection and recognition , 3d modelling of road environment ( e.g. @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "parallax flow computation was used by baehring et al . for detecting overtaking and close cutting vehicles",
    "@xcite . for detecting and avoiding collison , hong et al",
    "had used radar , lidar , camera and omnidirectional camera respectively @xcite , @xcite .",
    "they focused on detecting using lidar sensor data classifying object as static and dynamic and tracking using extended kalman filter and for getting a wide view of surrounding situation . for detection of forward collision srinivasa",
    "et al . have used forward looking camera and radar data @xcite .    in some works driver behaviour and",
    "inattentiveness was modelled using fatigue detection , drowsiness , eye tracking , visual analysis etc .",
    "@xcite presented tracking method for eye , gaze and face pose and hu et al .",
    "@xcite used svm based method for driver drowsiness detection .",
    "driver behavior was modelled using visual analysis of surrounding environment in our previous work @xcite .",
    "we summarize our system in fig .",
    "[ fig : blck ] , as to how we estimate road lanes , road boundary and departure angle .      for localising vehicle on the road estimation of some related parameters like its current lane , shape of the road and its position from centreline .",
    "to compute this parameters the road environment is scanned using wide angle camera sensor and extract lane markers . for lane detection",
    "we have proposed a novel method using lab colour space , 2nd and 4th order steerable filters and improved inverse perspective mapping . below our lane markers extraction algorithm",
    "is described .",
    "perspective effect + in real world situation if two parallel lines are captured they appears to be converged to some distant points so their nature ca nt be understood in images .",
    "road lanes are parallel , for detecting and localising them in images the effect of perspective projection is removed using inverse perspective projection . in this work",
    "we have presented a modified version of ipm , which is robust to a distance of 45 m .",
    "no internal parameter calibration of camera is required for computation in comparison to other algorithm @xcite , @xcite .",
    "suppose camera location with respect to car coordinates system ( cx , cy , cz ) where cz will be the height from ground lane h. optical axis make an angle @xmath0 known as pitch angle , @xmath1 yaw angle and @xmath2 as half of camera aperture as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cam ] .        to increase computational speed removing uninterested area from image",
    "we define horizon line from where our interested area will lie below `` horizon limit '' as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : horz ] . after applying this horizon limit ,",
    "inverse perspective mapping will be applied to this modified image .        for derivation of ipm road",
    "is assumed to be perfectly planer .",
    "because of this assumption different type of obstacles present in the road which does not lie in the road are deformed and seen as some noisy area in ipm image .",
    "denote image coordinates as @xmath3 and real world coordinates as @xmath4 .",
    "suppose camera resolution as @xmath5 , then the following image to world frame mapping equation is obtained from derivation @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9    @xmath10    where @xmath11 represent start row of image of interest .",
    "feature extraction + for detecting lines and curves , 2d steerable filters @xcite are very effective to use , because gradient changes due to color variation of road and lanes is effectively captured .",
    "in addition to that , due to their separability nature , computation is faster than other filters .",
    "the result obtained from both 2nd and 4th order filters are combined to extract final lane markings on the basis of adaptive thresholding , this depends also values of gradient angle to supress edge in unwanted direction . in fig .",

    "cubic interpolation and ransac + ransac method was used for identifying and getting potential lane points position from extracted features points for fitting a parabolic curves .",
    "ransac is an iterative algorithm , it removes outliers and fit defined model to data point .",
    "maximum of 8 curves ( lane lines ) can be identified by using this proposed method . in most of the roads except centre lane",
    "other lines are discontinuous , to get continuous edge to fit a polynomial in those plain areas cubic interpolation are very efficient .",

    "most of the time road lane boundary are not so clear and even not paved mainly in indian situation , to cope up with this we need to segment the road area . for this 3 class based gaussian mixture model",
    "was used for segmentation of the road region . since ipm image",
    "s majority pixels are road part and cars and other obstacles present in the road area becomes noise in the ipm image , so gmm can be used efficiently for this task .",

    "three clusters used for segmentation comprise of road region , surrounding natural scenes and road obstacles .",
    "predefined mean and covariance values for our clusters was used . for computation of these initial means and covariance , we collected separate patches from train images for these three categories and computed those values .",
    "this initialization gives us better result than random k means initialization .",
