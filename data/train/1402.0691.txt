    "in old stellar populations like galactic globular clusters ( ggcs ) , the hottest stars are blue stragglers ( bss ) , horizontal branch ( hb ) , post - early asymptotic giant branch ( peagb ) and agb - manqu whose spectral emission peaks at effective temperatures higher than @xmath0 @xcite . therefore these stars mostly emit in the ultraviolet ( uv ) part of the electromagnetic spectrum @xcite . since the earth s atmosphere is almost completely opaque to this wavelength regime , any campaign for the observation of hot stars in uv must be performed using space facilities like , for instance , the hubble space telescope ( ) or the galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ) .",
    "unfortunately , the theoretical models describing the evolution of stars of the earliest spectral types still suffer from many uncertainties which are also due to the absence of a complete and homogeneous sample of uv emitters .",
    "therefore , the uv observation of hot stars in ggcs is extremely important in order to compare data and evolutionary models in observational planes not hampered by critical color - effective temperature ( ) transformations @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting stellar evolutionary sequences that still wait to be fully understood is the hb .",
    "it is commonly accepted that metallicity is the first parameter driving the horizontal branch morphology .",
    "indeed , metal - rich ggcs typically have red hbs while metal - poor ones have more extended and blue hbs .",
    "however , there are several clusters with the same metallicity showing remarkable differences in horizontal branch morphology : nice examples are the couples 6388 - 5927 , m3 - m13 and m15 - m92 .",
    "therefore , metallicity alone is not able to explain the observation of the complex hb zoology in ggcs @xcite .",
    "this issue , known as the ` 2nd parameter ' problem , has focused the attention of several authors in the last years @xcite , but the solution is not obvious because many mechanisms play a role in shaping the color distribution of hb stars , such as mass loss , age and he abundance @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , now there is a general consensus about the fact that age is the main global 2nd parameter @xcite .",
    "the hb temperature extension can be an efficient way to parametrize the hb morphology and therefore to study the ` 2nd parameter ' problem .",
    "this approach has been already attempted by @xcite and , later on , by @xcite , who used optical cmds for their analysis .",
    "however , temperature derived from optical filters only , can be underestimated by more than @xmath1 in the case of very extended hbs ( see the case of 2808 , * ? ? ?",
    "this demonstrates the difficulties of deriving properties of hot hb populations from pure optical data . indeed in the optical plane ,",
    "stars move down to the blue hb tail either because the bolometric correction increases or because stellar luminosity decreases .",
    "for very blue hb stars ( like blue hook stars ) both the above quantities are changing and optical colors can not provide a reliable estimate of .    as a part of a large project aimed at characterizing the uv properties of ggcs",
    "@xcite we present here some preliminary results coming from the photometric analysis of uv observations of 31 ggcs obtained with the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) and finalized to accurately derive the hb temperature distribution and extension .",
    "a large dataset   of mid / far uv and optical images , in the filters @xmath2 and @xmath3 , has been collected with the wfpc2 on - board and has been complemented with a few images collected in the @xmath4 filter with the solar blind channel ( sbc ) of the advanced camera for survey ( acs@ ) , for a total sample of 31 ggcs .",
    "the targeted ggcs cover a wide range of metallicity ( @xmath5 ) and concentration parameter ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "every wfpc2 frame was pre - processed through the standard /wfpc2",
    "pipeline for bias subtraction , dark correction and flat fielding and corrected for specific instrument - induced variation of the signal (  34th row  effect and pixel area correction , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) across the field of view ( fov ) .",
    "then , we have extracted single images from the four - chip mosaic of the wfpc2 and , for each given chip and filter , we have combined them by using specific iraf tasks and cosmic - ray rejection algorithms  , in order to obtain a combined median image with high s / n .    the photometric analysis of the combined image has been performed with daophotiv / allstar @xcite .",
    "an analytic point spread function ( psf ) has been evaluated on each image by selecting bright , isolated stars uniformly distributed over the entire chip area .",
    "once the instrumental catalogs have been obtained for the different chips and filters , they have been geometrically matched by using daomatch / daomaster @xcite , in order to build a master catalog .",
    "stars in the master catalog are then force - fitted onto single images by using allframe @xcite , eventually obtaining an instrumental catalog for each filter / chip combination . for every catalog we computed and applied the aperture correction by using daogrow @xcite and the charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) and uv loss by means of the equations provided by @xcite .",
    "instrumental magnitudes were finally calibrated to the vegamag system by following the prescriptions and the zero points provided in the wfpc2 instrument science report 97 - 01 @xcite .",
    "among the surveyed targets particular interest is undoubtedly reserved to @xmath8 ( 5139 , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this stellar system hosts at least six sub - population of stars with different @xmath9-elements and iron abundances @xcite , and with significant spread in helium @xcite .",
    "as far as the hot stellar populations are concerned , @xmath7 shows , together with 2419 @xcite , the largest population of bsss @xcite , as well as one of the most extended hb @xcite .    due to its large half - light radius of 5arcmin (",
    "* edition ) , 13 fields around the center of @xmath7 have been imaged in the wfpc2 uv survey .",
    "images were collected in two filters : @xmath10 and @xmath3 .",

    "[ fig : fig1 ] . in this plane",
    "we can distinguish at least three well defined sequences .",
    "the vertical strip at ( @xmath11 ) @xmath12 is a combination of the bright red giant branch ( rgb ) and agb stars .",
    "the presence of such cool stars in this uv plane is due to the spectral response of the filter f170w which suffers from a quite important ` red - leak ' ( wfpc2 instrument handbook , august 2008 ) .",
    "the diagonal strip extending from the base of the rgb to @xmath13 is populated by the brightest bsss in our fov  .",
    "the brightest and hottest stars in the ( @xmath14 ) cmd are hb and post - hb stars .",
    "the hb of @xmath7 is almost homogeneously populated from red ( @xmath15 ) to extremely blue colors ( @xmath16 ) .",

    "encircled areas emphasize the different evolutionary sequences : rgb+agb = red giant branch + asymptotic giant branch , bss = blue stragglers , hb = horizontal branch , blue hook , wd = white dwarfs . ]",
    "other than for @xmath7 , the data analysis has been completed for nine additional ggcs in the survey .",
    "the relative cmds are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "they display features ( rgb , hb , bss ) similar to those already described for the cmd of @xmath7 .",

    "as stated in sect .  [ sec : intro ] , one of the scientific goals of the wfpc2 uv survey is to derive the temperature distribution of hb stars in the observed clusters . in order to accomplish this task we must compare the observations with suitable theoretical models . as detailed in @xcite and @xcite , there are several important points that should be properly taken into account : the effect of radiative levitation , @xmath9-element variation and the presence of sub - populations with different he abundance . in this sense @xmath7",
    "represents a very interesting case but it needs particular caution because of its complexity . among the clusters already available ( see figures  [ fig : fig1 ] and [ fig : fig2 ] ) we decided to start our analysis with a relatively simple case : 6293 .",
    "this ggc has apparent distance modulus @xmath18 and reddening @xmath19 ( * ? ? ?",

    "the filled gray circles correspond to the hb stars selected in the optical cmd ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ) .",
    "a zahb model , suitably calculated for this cluster ( see text for explanation ) , has been overplotted as a solid black line .",
    "some temperature values along the zahb are also marked . ]    ) plane . ]    because of the ` red - leak ' of the @xmath10 filter ( sect .",
    "[ sec : cmds ] ) some of the coolest hb stars may overlap the rgb sequence in the far uv - optical plane .",
    "for this reason we first selected hb stars in the optical cmd ( filled gray circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ) , where the separation between hb and rgb stars at low  is clearer .",
    "the position of the hb stars in the uv - optical cmd is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] , where we also plotted the best - fit zero age horizontal branch ( zahb ) model from the basti database @xcite , computed by assuming @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and reddening @xmath24 .",
    "it is important to notice that , because of the spectral response of the @xmath10 filter , the reddening correction is a strongly variable function of the temperature ( color ) of the star and it therefore requires particular attention .",
    "a crucial step in our analysis is the search for variable stars populating the hb .",
    "indeed , they could considerably affect the determination of the hb temperature distribution . according to the catalogue of variable stars in galactic globular clusters (",
    "* update ) , 6293 is known to host five rr lyrae stars but only three of them fall in our wfpc2 fov . moreover ,",
    "their position in the clement s catalog is derived from ground - based observations and we were not able to unambiguously identify them in our high - resolution hst catalog .",
    "their inclusion in our hb sample , however , does not affect at all our analysis .",
    "following the procedure described in @xcite we derived the temperature of each star by projecting its color onto the zahb model .",
    "the temperature is the result of the interpolation between the two closest points of the zahb .",
    "the distribution obtained is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] .",
    "we observe that the histogram spans a temperature interval going from @xmath25 to @xmath26 and that the mode of the distribution is located at @xmath27 .",
    "more than 50% of the stars have a temperature higher than the peak value . to establish",
    "how much the ` red - leak ' affects the estimate of temperature of the cold hb stars in the uv - optical plane , we determined the temperature of the same stars also from the optical ( @xmath28 ) cmd .",
    "then , we determined the difference between the two temperature estimates .",
    "we found that the average differences of the hb stars colder and hotter than @xmath29 agree each other within the errors .    unfortunately , neither photometric nor spectroscopic temperature estimates for the hb stars of 6293 are available in literature .",
    "therefore , no direct comparison can be done with our data .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite , by using the same set of theoretical models described in the present paper , found that the photometric estimates of the hb star temperatures of the cluster 2808 are fairly consistent with the temperatures derived from the spectroscopic observations by @xcite .",
    "we have analyzed far / mid uv - optical images for ten out of 31 ggcs collected within the wfpc2 uv survey .",
    "the main task of this analysis is to derive the extension and the temperature distribution of the hb of the targeted clusters taking advantage of the uv data .",
    "the use of uv bands is the best tool to accomplish our task since , for stars with high , the bolometric correction decreases and the stellar luminosity increases with respect to the optical bands .",
    "it has been shown , indeed , that the temperatures of extended hbs derived from a combination of pure optical filters can be underestimated by @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "we used 6293 as a starting point in our analysis , determining the temperature distribution of its hb stars .",
    "we are now applying this analysis to other ggcs in our sample with extended hbs , like @xmath7 and m15 .",
