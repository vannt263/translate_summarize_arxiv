    "the perturbative particle - vibration - coupling ( pvc ) model for odd - particle - number nuclei emerges naturally from the self - consistent green s function theory  @xcite .",
    "it describes the polarization of the nucleus when one particle is added or removed  @xcite , and its results can , in principle , be directly compared against experimental data .",
    "as used in nuclear physics , the perturbative pvc method employs one - particle or one - hole states ( or one - quasiparticle states ) coupled with the rpa or qrpa excitations of an even - even reference nucleus , and the residual nucleon - nucleon interaction that mixes these states at second - order perturbation theory .",
    "numerous pvc calculations of increasing level of sophistication have already been performed , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and excellent recent reviews thereof available in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "an alternative to describing odd nuclei within the perturbative pvc calculations are the energy - density - functional ( edf ) methods , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite , which use blocking of single - particle ( s.p . ) or quasiparticle orbitals . to distinguish these methods from the full pvc approach , in the present study we call them mean - field polarizations or polarization corrections .",
    "the advantage of blocked mean - field calculations is that they are non - perturbative and variational .",
    "as it turns out , the effects obtained within the blocked mean - field methods are substantially different and , in general , weaker than those obtained from the perturbative pvc  @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy between models , even when using exactly the same interactions and model spaces , needs to be solved , and this is the main purpose of the present work .    the link between the mean - field and perturbative methods has been proposed long time ago  @xcite . here",
    ", we identify several approximations that are required to firmly establish such a link , and we also extend the derivations to edfs based on density - dependent interactions and to those that include pairing correlations . since the determination of mean - field polarizations requires breaking symmetries , no numerical comparison of the two approaches , such as given here , is available up to now . as required by a thorough comparison , both in the mean - field and ( q)rpa calculations we use full self - consistency and exactly the same particle - hole edfs , pairing interactions , and model spaces .",

    "in this section we revisit the classic problem  @xcite of the polarization effect exerted by an odd particle on a mean - field state . to put further discussion in perspective , we study the problem in the hf approximation , and we assume that the mean field is obtained by the hf averaging  @xcite of a given known two - body _ density - independent _ interaction that has antisymmetrized matrix elements @xmath0 .",

    "we use the notation , in which the upper and lower signs correspond to adding or subtracting a particle . without pairing correlations ,",

    "what follows _ we always neglect _ the so - called center - of - mass correction to the kinetic energy  @xcite .",
    "these corrections are explicitly @xmath3-dependent and thus give trivial so - called mass polarization corrections  @xcite to energy differences @xmath12 .",

    "this is to avoid a confusion of understanding @xmath16 as a correction to the orbital itself ; indeed , this correction certainly corresponds to a modification of _ all _ orbitals of the system .",
    "the corrective density matrix @xmath16 can be small only when the orbital @xmath15 , and the states in even and odd nuclei , are chosen in a specific way .",
    "we may then have four interesting cases to consider .",
    "in the first case , let us assume that we initially solve the self - consistent equations of the even @xmath3-particle system , and @xmath21 is one of the unoccupied hf eigenstates therein ( a particle state ) , that is , @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",

    "note that by this procedure _ all _ hf single - states of the @xmath3-particle system become modified , including the added orbital @xmath21 .",
    "the second case is obtained by a similar procedure , where instead we arrive at a polarized @xmath25-particle system .",
    "for that , we pick @xmath21 as one of the occupied hf eigenstates of the @xmath3-particle system ( a hole state ) , that is , @xmath22 , @xmath26 . by removing a particle from this state and solving the self - consistent equations of the @xmath25-particle system",
    ", we now obtain the polarization correction corresponding to a hole .",
    "note that for the two choices discussed up to now , the density matrices @xmath27 and @xmath28 , are projective , that is , @xmath29    the two remaining interesting cases correspond to inverse polarizations , namely , we may initially solve the self - consistent equations of the @xmath7-particle systems , and then pick @xmath15 either as an unoccupied orbital in the @xmath25-particle system , @xmath30 , @xmath31 or as an occupied orbital in the @xmath24-particle system , @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",

    "however , for _ inverse polarizations _ , for which the polarizing orbital @xmath21 is calculated in the _ odd _ system , we obtain the standard ph structure ( [ eq:57 ] ) of @xmath16 .    from these considerations",

    "equation ( [ eq:55c ] ) is a simple consequence of the antisymmetry of the two - body matrix elements and represents the fact that in the hf approximation there is no self interaction ( si )",

    "the odd - system energy can be written as , @xmath52    up to now , expression ( [ eq:5b ] ) is exact . to simplify it",
    ", we can use the rpa expansion ( [ eq:52 ] ) and thus conditions ( [ eq:57 ] ) , and neglect terms beyond second order . in the basis of particle and hole states , the mean - field hamiltonian @xmath53 is by definition diagonal ; therefore , owing to eqs .",
    "( [ eq:57 ] ) , the third term on the right - hand side is of the second order in @xmath43 .",
    "similarly , the fifth term is obviously of the second order too . however ,",
    "unless we assume that @xmath54 is small ( of the first rpa order ) , the fourth term may contain subleading second - order terms , which we can not treat .",
    "therefore , to have a consistent second - order expression for the energy of the @xmath55 system , we must make the assumption of @xmath54 being small as compared to @xmath2 .",
    "this assumption can also be understood as @xmath13 being small as compared to @xmath1 , that is , the system being appropriately heavy .",

    "then , we obtain the following approximate expression , @xmath57 this can be summarized in the form of polarization corrections to energies of odd states @xmath58 , @xmath59 or polarization corrections to s.p .  energies",

    "however , fields ( [ eq:117x ] ) are not restricted to @xmath275 and thus the qrpa sif corrections ( [ eq:86e ] ) must be summed up over @xmath245 and @xmath276 .    from expressions ( [ eq:101faa ] )",
    "we see that the polarization corrections calculated for orbitals with given values of @xmath233 are obtained by folding the @xmath207-dependent ( but @xmath233-independent ) contributions @xmath277 and @xmath278 with simple clebsh - gordan coefficients .",

    "it is also clear that by blocking quasiparticles with mixed values of @xmath233 , one would have obtained non - zero reduced matrix elements for non - zero values of @xmath249 , and thus in odd systems , non - axial deformations would have appeared .",
