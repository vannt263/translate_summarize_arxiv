    "physics students learn general relativity ( gr ) as the modern theory of gravitation . in that theory each gravitational field generated by a given energy - momentum tensor is represented by a lorentzian spacetime , i.e. , a structure @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a non compact ( locally compact ) @xmath2-dimensional hausdorff manifold , @xmath3 is a lorentzian metric on @xmath4 and @xmath5 is its levi - civita connection .",
    "moreover @xmath4 is supposed oriented by the volume form  @xmath6 and the symbol @xmath7 means that the spacetime is time orientable . from the geometrical objects in the structure",
    "@xmath0 we can calculate the _ riemann curvature tensor _",
    "@xmath8 of @xmath5 and a nontrivial gr model is one in which @xmath9 . in that way",
    "textbooks often say that in gr _ spacetime is curved_. unfortunately many people mislead the curvature of a connection @xmath5 on @xmath4 with the fact that @xmath4 can eventually be a bent surface in an ( pseudo ) euclidean space with a sufficient number of dimensions according to the whitney theorem can be realized as a submanifold of @xmath10 , with @xmath11 . however , if @xmath4 carries additional structure the number @xmath12 in general must be greater than @xmath13 .",
    "indeed , it has been shown by eddington @xcite that if dim @xmath14 and if @xmath4 carries a lorentzian metric @xmath3 , which moreover satisfies einstein s equations , then @xmath4 can be locally embedded in a ( pseudo)euclidean space @xmath15 also , isometric embeddings of general lorentzian spacetimes would require a lot of extra dimensions @xcite . indeed , a compact lorentzian manifold can be embedded isometrically in @xmath16 and a non - compact one can be embedded isometrically in @xmath17 ! ] .",
    "this confusion leads to all sort of wishful thinking because many forget that gr does not fix the topology of @xmath4 that often must be put by hand  when solving a problem ,  and thus think that they can bend spacetime if they have an appropriate kind of some exotic matter .",
    "worse , the insistence in supposing that the gravitational field is _ geometry _ lead the majority of physicists to relegate the search for the real physical nature of the gravitational field as not important at all.instead , students are advertised that gr is considered by may physicists as the most beautiful physical theory @xcite .",
    "however textbooks with a few exceptions ( see , e.g. , the excellent book by sachs and wu @xcite ) forget to say to their readers that in gr there are no genuine conservation laws of energy - momentum and angular momentum unless spacetime has some _ additional _ structure which is not present in a general lorentzian spacetime @xcite .",
    "only a few people tried to develop consistently theories where the gravitational field ( at least from the classical point of view ) is a field in the faraday s sense living in minkowski spacetime ( see below ) .    in this paper",
    "we want to recall two important results that hopefully will lead people to realize that eventually it is time to disclose the real nature of the gravitational field .",
    "the first result is that the representation of gravitational fields by lorentzian spacetimes is eventually no more than an consequence of to the differential geometry knowledge of einstein and grossmann when they where struggling to find a consistent way to describe the gravitational field .",
    "indeed , there are some geometrical structures different from @xmath0 that can equivalently represent such a field .",
    "the second result is that the gravitational field ( in all known situations ) can also be nicely represented as a field in the faraday s sense @xcite living in a fixed background spacetime .",
    "concerning the alternative geometrical models , the particular cases where the connection is teleparallel ( i.e. , it is metrical compatible , has _",
    "null _ riemann curvature tensor and _ non null _ torsion tensor ) and the one where the connection is _ not _ metrical compatible ( i.e. , its nonmetricity tensor @xmath18 ) will be addressed below .",
    "however to understand how those alternative geometrical models ( and the physical model ) can be constructed  and why the lorentzian spacetime model was einstein s first choice , it is eventually worth to recall some historical facts concerning attempts by einstein ( and others ) to build a geometrical unified theory of the gravitational and electromagnetic fields .",
    "we start with the word torsion .",
    "although such a word seems to have been introduced by cartan @xcite in 1922 the fact is that the concept behind the name already appeared in a ricci s paper @xcite from 1895 and was also used in @xcite ! in those papers ricci introduced what is now called the cartan s _ moving frames _ and the _",
    "teleparallel geometry_.    moreover in 1901 ricci and levi - civita published a joy @xcite , which has become the _ bible _ of tensor calculus and which has been extensively studied by einstein and grossmann in their search for the theory of the gravitational field .",
    "however einstein and grossmann seems to have studied only the first part of reference 4 and so missed the cartan s moving method  and the concept of torsion .",
    "it seems also that only after 1922 einstein become interested in the second chapter of the joy , titled _ la gomtrie intrinseque comme instrument de calcul _ and discovered torsion and the teleparallel geometry .",
    "as it is well known he tried to identify a certain contraction of the torsion tensor of a teleparallel geometry with the electromagnetic potential , but after sometime he discovered that the idea did not work .",
    "einstein s first papers on the subject are @xcite . also in a paper which einstein wrote in 1925 @xcite the torsion tensor concept already appeared , since he considered as one of his field variables the antisymmetric part of a _ non symmetric _ connection .",
    "all those papers by einstein have been translated into english by unzicker and case @xcite and can be downloaded from the arxiv .",
    "we also can learn in @xcite that cartan tried to explain the teleparallel geometry to einstein when he visited paris in 1922 using the example of what we call the _ nunes connection _",
    "( _ or navigator connection _ ) on the punctured sphere .",
    "since this example illustrates in a crystal clear way the fact that one must not confound the riemann curvature of a given connection defined on a manifold @xmath4 with the fact that @xmath4 may be viewed as a _ bent _",
    "hypersurface embedded in an euclidean space ( with appropriate number of dimensions ) it will be presented in appendix a. a comparison of the parallel transport according to the nunes connection and according to the usual levi - civita connection is done , and it is shown that the nunes connection the riemann curvature of the punctured sphere is _ null_. in this sense the geometry of the punctured sphere is conventional as emphasized by poincar @xcite long ago .    as we already said",
    "the main objective of the present paper is to clarify the fact that there are different ways of geometrically representing a gravitational field , such that the field equations in each representation result equivalent to einstein s field equations .",
    "explicitly we mean by this statement the following : any model of a gravitational field in gr represented by  a _ lorentzian spacetime _ ( _ with non null riemann curvature tensor and null torsion tensor _ which is also parallelizable is said to be parallelizable if it admits four _ global _ linearly independent vector fields . ] ) is equivalent to a teleparallel spacetime ( i.e. , a spacetime structure equipped with a metrical compatible teleparallel connection , which has _",
    "null _ riemann curvature tensor and _ non null _ torsion tensor ) or equivalent to a special spacetime structure , where the manifold @xmath4 is equipped with a minkowski metric , and where there is also defined a connection such that its _",
    "nonmetricity tensor _ is not null .",
    "the teleparallel possibility is described in details in section 2 using the modern theory of differential forms and we claim that our presentation leaves also clear that we can even dispense with the concept of a _ connection _ in the description of a gravitational field , it is only necessary for such a representation to exists that the manifold @xmath4 representing the set of all possible events be parallelizable , admitting four global ( not all exact ) @xmath19-form fields coupled in a specific way ( see below ) .",
    "the second possibility is illustrated with an example in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we present the conclusions .",
    "suppose that a @xmath2-dimensional @xmath4 manifold is parallelizable , thus admitting a set of four global linearly independent vector @xmath20 , @xmath21 fields means section of the tangent bundle and @xmath22 means section of the cotangent bundle . also @xmath23 means the bundle of tensors of type @xmath24 and @xmath25 a section of the bundle of @xmath26-forms fields .",
    "] such @xmath27 is a basis for @xmath28 and let @xmath29 be the corresponding dual basis ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "suppose also that not all the @xmath31 are closed , i.e. , @xmath32 for a least some @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath2-form field @xmath33 defines a ( positive ) orientation for @xmath4 .",
    "now , the @xmath34 can be used to define a lorentzian metric field in @xmath4 by defining @xmath35 by @xmath36 with the matrix with entries @xmath37 being the diagonal matrix @xmath38 .",
    "then , according to @xmath3 the @xmath39 are orthonormal , i.e. , @xmath40    since according to _ eq.([2 ] ) _ @xmath41 is a global time like vector field it follows it defines a time orientation in @xmath4 which we denote by @xmath7 .",
    "it follows that that the 4-tuple @xmath42 is part of a structure defining a _ lorentzian spacetime _ and can serve as a _ substructure _ to model a gravitational field in gr .    for future use",
    "we also introduce @xmath43 by@xmath44 and we write:@xmath45    due to the hypothesis given by eq.([0 ] ) the vector fields @xmath46 , @xmath21 will in general satisfy@xmath47=c_{\\mathbf{ab}}^{\\mathbf{k}}{\\mbox{\\bfseries\\slshape e}}_{\\mathbf{k } } , \\label{5}\\ ] ] where the @xmath48 are the structure coefficients of the basis @xmath49 .",
    "it can been easily shown that@xmath50    now , we introduce two different metric compatible connections on @xmath4 , namely @xmath5 ( the levi - civita connection of @xmath3 ) and a _ teleparallel _ connection @xmath51 , such that@xmath52    the objects @xmath53are called the connection coefficients of the connection @xmath5 in the @xmath49 basis and the objects @xmath54 defined by @xmath55 are called the connection @xmath19-forms in the @xmath49 basis .",
    "the connection coefficients @xmath56 of @xmath51 and the connection @xmath19-forms of @xmath51 in the basis @xmath49 are null according to the second line of _ eq.([7 ] ) and thus the basis _",
    "@xmath49 is called teleparallel .",
    "so , the connection @xmath51 defines an absolute parallelism on @xmath4 .",
    "we recall that as said in the introduction that idea has been introduced by ricci .    of course , as it is well known the riemann curvature tensor of @xmath5 ,  is in general non null in all points of @xmath4 , but the torsion tensor of @xmath5 is zero in all points of @xmath4 . on the other hand",
    "the riemann curvature tensor of @xmath51 is null in all points of @xmath4 , whereas the torsion tensor of @xmath51 is non null in all points of @xmath4 .",
    "we recall also in order to fix notation that for a general connection , say @xmath57 on @xmath4 ( not necessarily metric compatible ) the _ torsion and curvature operations _ and the torsion and _ curvature _ tensors of a given general connection , say @xmath57 , are respectively the mappings:@xmath58,\\label{top}\\\\ \\mathbf{\\rho(u , v ) }   &   = \\mathbf{d}_{\\mathbf{u}}\\mathbf{d}_{\\mathbf{v}}-\\mathbf{d}_{\\mathbf{v}}\\mathbf{d}_{\\mathbf{u}}-\\mathbf{d}_{[\\mathbf{u , v } ] } \\label{cop}\\ ] ]    and@xmath59 for every @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",

    "then , by definition ( see , e.g. , @xcite for more details ) the ammetricities tensors of @xmath169 relative to @xmath170 and of @xmath5 relative to @xmath3 are null , i.e. , @xmath205    however , the nonmetricity tensor  @xmath206 of @xmath169 relative to @xmath3 is non null , i.e. , @xmath207 and also the nonmetricity tensor  @xmath208 of @xmath5 relative to @xmath170 is non null , i.e.,@xmath209    we now calculate the components of @xmath210 in the coordinated bases @xmath211 for @xmath28 and @xmath212 for @xmath213 associated with the coordinates @xmath214 of @xmath4 . since @xmath169 is the levi - civita connection of the minkowski metric @xmath170 we have that @xmath215 i.e. , the connection coefficients @xmath216 of @xmath169 in this basis are _ null . _",

    "note that also that @xmath222 .      from what has been said it is obvious that since @xmath227 and @xmath228 are both orientable and time orientable , then @xmath223 , @xmath225 are part of the structures representing  respectively minkowski spacetime and schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "more precisely , @xmath229 represents in gr the gravitational field of a point mass with world line given by @xmath230 . as usual in gr",
    "this world line is left out of the effective manifold ..",
    "the reason for that is that almost all mathematical physicists use manifolds with _ boundary _ in order to avoid the use of distributions ( generalized functions ) . indeed , for a rigorous point of view , taking into account that einstein s equations are non linear",
    "we can not solve it using schwartz distributions . to solve problems involving singular distributions in gr in a rigorous way it is necessary to use colombeau theory of generalized functions as described , e.g. , in @xcite . ]",

    "since in the cartesian coordinates @xmath241 , but not all @xmath242 are null we get @xmath243 and thus , e.g. , @xmath244      note that using coordinates ( riemann normal coordinates @xmath245 covering @xmath246 ) naturally adapted to a reference frame @xmath247 in free fall according to gr ( @xmath248 @xmath249 , @xmath250 ) it is possible to put the connection coefficients of the levi - civita connection @xmath5 of @xmath3 equal to zero in all points of the world line of a free fall observer ( an _ observer _ is here _ modelled _ as an integral line @xmath251 of a reference frame @xmath252 , where @xmath252 is a time like vector field pointing to the future such that @xmath253 ) .    in the riemann",

    "@xmath254 of @xmath169 in the basis @xmath255 .",
    "the situation is somewhat analogous to what happens in any non inertial reference frame which , of course , may be conveniently used in _ any _ special relativity problem ( as e.g. , in a rotating disc @xcite ) , where the connection coefficients of the levi - civita connection of @xmath170 are not all null .",

    "we would say that the gravitational field _ distorts _ the period of the atomic clocks relative to the standard clocks of the proposed model where gravity is represented by a nonmetricity tensor is known experimentally we can determine @xmath188 with the  mathematical techniques described in @xcite .",
    "but , who are the devices that now materialize those concepts ?",
    "well , they may are _ paper concepts _ , like the notion of time in some newtonian theories .",
    "they are defined and calculated in order to make _ correct _ predictions .",
    "however , given the status of present technology we can easily imagine how to build devices for directly realizing the standard clocks _ _ ( _ _ and rulers _ _ ) _ _ of the proposed model .",
    "in this paper we recalled two important results .",
    "the first is that a gravitational field generated by a given energy - momentum distribution can be represented by distinct geometrical structures ( lorentzian , teleparallel and non null nonmetricity spacetimes ) .",
    "the second important result is that we can even dispense all those geometrical structures and simply represent the gravitational field as a field in the faraday s sense living in minkowski spacetime .",
    "the explicit lagrangian density for this theory has been discussed and the field equations have been shown to be equivalent to einstein s equations .",
    "we hope that our study clarifies the real difference between mathematical models and physical reality and leads people to think about the real physical nature of the gravitational field ( and also of the electromagnetic field )    as a final remark , we want to leave clear that after studying einstein s papers ( and also papers by many others authors ) on the use riemann - cartan to describe a classical unified theory of gravitation and electromagnetism we became convinced that it seems impossible to represent the electromagnetic field using a contraction of the torsion tensor ( or the torsion tensor ) without introducing ad hoc hypothesis . having said that we recall that from time to time some authors return to the embryo of einstein s original idea claiming to have obtained an unified theory of gravitation and electromagnetism using that tool . among those theories that appeared in the last few years some are completely worthless , since based in a very bad use of mathematical concepts , but some looks at least at a first sight interesting enough ( at least from the mathematical point of view ) to deserve some comments , which will be discussed elsewhere .",
