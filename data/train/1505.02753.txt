    "in the last decades the study of complex networks has been growing strongly due to the large number of systems that exhibit this type of structures .",
    "a complex network is a set of nodes that are connected by internal links and the most fundamental property that characterizes its topology is the degree distribution @xmath3 , which represents the probability that a node has @xmath4 neighbors or connectivity @xmath4 .",
    "it has been found that many real systems such as social , communication and biological networks present a degree distribution given by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the exponent of the power law and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the minimum and maximum degree of the network .",
    "these kind of networks are called scale free ( sf ) and one of its most important features is that are in general very heterogeneous , i.e. most nodes of the network have a low connectivity while only a few have a high connectivity ( hubs ) . in recent years",
    "the study of synchronization processes in isolate complex networks has been increasing because of its importance in neurobiology @xcite and population dynamics @xcite . a common theoretical approach to study synchronization in complex networks",
    "is to map this process onto an interface growth model by assigning to each node a scalar field @xmath10 , with @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the size of the network .",
    "this scalar field could represent , for example , the amount of load on a node in the problem of distributed parallel computing on processors . without loss of generality",
    "we will relate the scalar field to a set of heights on the interface .",
    "the most relevant magnitude that characterizes the interface is @xmath13 , which represents the fluctuations of the scalar field around its mean value on the network , given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the average of the scalar field over the nodes at time @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the average over different network realizations .",
    "the roughness evolves in time until it saturates at the steady state . in the saturation regime",
    "@xmath18 is a constant that depends only on @xmath6 . in complex networks",
    "the synchronization of the system is related to the roughness in the saturation regime @xcite .",
    "one of the most simple and used models to study synchronization in complex networks is the surface relaxation model ( srm ) @xcite which is a modication of the classic family model largely used in euclidean interfaces @xcite . in this model , at each time step , a node @xmath19 is randomly chosen and the node with the lowest height between the chosen node and all its neighbors evolves increasing its height .",
    "it has been found that for isolated sf networks , with @xmath20 , @xmath21 @xcite until a critical value @xmath22 , after which @xmath18 becomes independent of @xmath12 , which means that the system becomes scalable @xcite .",
    "although it was an interesting result , many real systems are not isolated but interacting with other systems instead .",
    "this means that a process that develops in one network can be affected by a process developing in another and vice versa @xcite .",
    "such is the case of epidemic models where the interaction between networks make it very harmful for the healthy populations because the interaction increases the theoretical risk of infection compared with the same process in isolated networks @xcite .",
    "these interacting systems can be modeled as networks that interact through external links that connect nodes that belongs to different networks .",
    "now the question is , does synchronization in interacting networks performs worse or better than synchronization in isolated networks ? .",
    "in order to answer this question , in this letter we study the synchronization of two sf networks with the same size @xmath12 that interact through a fraction @xmath0 of nodes connected , one by one , between them .",
    "the model used is the srm model which we adapt to interacting networks and study the effect of the interaction parameter @xmath0 on the fluctuations in both networks .",
    "are only dropped on the network @xmath23 in this scheme .",
    "the numbers represent different nodes in each network and the red dotted lines represent the external connections between nodes of different networks . in this case @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the arrows indicate the path that the particles follow , which goes from the node where the particle was originally dropped , to the node where the particle gets finally deposited .",
    "the height of the nodes is measured from the upper line of the boxes that represent the numbers assigned to the nodes in each network.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    in our model , two uncorrelated sf networks , called @xmath23 and @xmath26 , with the same size @xmath12 and exponent @xmath27 and @xmath28 respectively are built using the molloy - reed algorithm @xcite disallowing self loops and multiple connections . as we need a single interface on each network , in order to ensure that we have a single component we use @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "each node @xmath30 , with @xmath31 , has a connectivity @xmath32 and we denote the set of its neighbors by @xmath33 . in order to build the external connections between the networks we connect by simplicity , the first @xmath34 nodes in @xmath23 one by one with the first @xmath34 in @xmath26 , where @xmath0 is the interaction parameter with @xmath35 .",
    "notice that if both networks are uncorrelated this procedure is the same as connecting a fraction q of nodes at random .",
    "we define the vector @xmath36 , where @xmath37 , with @xmath38 , is equal to @xmath39 if the node @xmath19 in @xmath23 has an external connection with @xmath19 in @xmath26 , and @xmath40 otherwise . in order to simplify the growth rules we choose random initial conditions for the scalar field in the interval @xmath41 $ ] , hence , we avoid the cases in which different nodes have equal heights , as we are only interested in the saturation regime on both networks where the initial condition plays no role",

    "a network @xmath42 ( with @xmath31 ) is chosen with probability @xmath43 and then a `` particle '' , which represents the load , is dropped in a node @xmath19 selected randomly in @xmath42 .",

    "this regime for @xmath20 is close to @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "we check that the nature of this regime is due to the distribution of internal connectivities and that it is almost not affected by the interaction parameter @xmath0 . thus in our research",
    "we use @xmath62 in order to ensure that we are in the scalable regime .",
    "we will show our results only for @xmath57 and @xmath58 , because all the other combinations of the exponents @xmath6 in @xmath63 give qualitatively the same results .",

    "[ fig.2 ] we show @xmath65 as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "it is clear that as the interaction parameter @xmath0 increases , @xmath66 decreases in both networks , which implies that the synchronization improves . from the plot we can also observe that as @xmath0 increases , the difference between @xmath67 and @xmath68 becomes smaller , which means that the synchronization in each network becomes mainly controlled by @xmath0 and not by the internal degree distributions . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] we show @xmath59 as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "it can be seen how is the rate of improvement in the synchronization with the increment of @xmath0 .",
    "for example , for @xmath69 the synchronization enhances approximately @xmath70 and for @xmath2 around @xmath1 .",
    "it is worth pointing out that this rate decreases as @xmath0 increases , and this means that the effect of the optimization gets less significant as the networks have more interconnections between them .     as a function of @xmath4 for @xmath71 in @xmath23 ( @xmath72 ) and @xmath26 ( @xmath73 ) , @xmath74 in @xmath23 ( @xmath75 ) and @xmath26 ( @xmath76 ) and @xmath2 in @xmath23 ( @xmath77 ) and @xmath26 ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "the inset is an amplification of @xmath79 for the lowest values of @xmath4 for @xmath71 in @xmath23 ( @xmath72 ) and @xmath2 in @xmath23 ( @xmath77),scaledwidth=49.0% ]    to understand the effect of the interaction parameter @xmath0 on the optimization of the process we compute the difference between the average height of nodes with degree @xmath4 , denoted by @xmath80 and the mean value of the height @xmath81 as a function of @xmath4 . in fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] we show @xmath82 as a function of @xmath4 for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "we can see that , for @xmath71 the heights of low connectivity nodes , which are the majority in sf networks , are closer to the average height of the network than the heights of high degree nodes , which are above @xmath81 .",
    "this means that hubs are usually overloaded because all their neighbors send them their excess of load , affecting negatively the synchronization of the system .",
    "however , as the factor @xmath0 increases the height of the hubs decreases , approaching to @xmath81 and becoming independent of @xmath4 for @xmath2 . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] , we can see an amplification of the behavior of @xmath83 for the nodes with the lowest connectivity .",
    "we can see that as @xmath0 increases their heights also approach to the average value .",
    "these results imply that as we increase the factor @xmath0 hubs are no longer overloaded and therefore their excess of load is now absorbed by low connectivity nodes .",
    "at which a particle spreads from the network @xmath42 to the network @xmath50 as a function of @xmath0 . with @xmath84 ( @xmath77 ) , @xmath85 ( @xmath76 ) , @xmath86 ( @xmath75 ) and @xmath87 ( @xmath72 ) . from the definition",

    "hence we measure the rates @xmath94 at which a particle dropped in the network @xmath42 gets finally deposited in the network @xmath50 . in fig .",
    "[ fig.4 ] we plot @xmath94 as a function of @xmath0 . when @xmath95 the rate always decreases with @xmath0 , because the particles have more chances to cross to the other network .",
    "we can see that the rate is always much bigger when @xmath95 than in the case of @xmath96 , which means that the particles tend to diffuse in the same network most of the time .",
    "the fact that a small portion of load that crosses between networks is enough to enhance the synchronization is due to the fact that the dynamics of the srm in both networks are coupled due to the interaction .",
    "another observation is that all the rates do almost not depend on the degree distribution of each network .",
    "the majority of nodes with @xmath97 have an external connection with low connectivity nodes , due to the fact that these are selected at random and are the most common ones in sf networks .",
    "the fact that the amount of nodes with low connectivity does not change much with variations in @xmath98 for @xmath99 , and also because the diffusion between networks depends directly on the externally connected nodes whether a particle crosses to another network or remains in the same , make that the rates have almost no dependence on the exponents of the original degree distributions .",
    ".dispersion @xmath100 of the distributions @xmath101 for different values of @xmath0 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     how the load gets distributed after the diffusion process ? in order to answer this question we compute the probability @xmath102 , defined as the probability that a particle dropped in the network @xmath42 gets deposited in a node with degree @xmath4 in the network @xmath50 . in fig .",
    "[ fig.5 ] we plot @xmath102 with @xmath103 for @xmath74 . also in table [ tabdisp ] we report the dispersion @xmath104 of these distributions , which quantifies the heterogeneity of the deposition process , for different values of @xmath0 and for the isolated networks .",
    "from the plot we can see that the probabilities @xmath105 for @xmath31 are very heterogeneous and have a similar dispersion to the dispersion in the isolated networks .",
    "this means that when a particle stays on the network where it was originally dropped finds an environment with a similar heterogeneity than in the isolate sf network .",
    "moreover the distributions @xmath102 for @xmath106 are more homogeneous than in the case @xmath95 and thus have a lower dispersion .",
    "this means that when a particle crosses from one network to another it finds a more homogeneous neighborhood than in the case in which stays in the same network , and as we will show below low - degree nodes are filled more often than high - degree nodes .",
    "also we can see that the dispersion , for all cases , slightly grows with @xmath0 , and this is due to the fact that hubs are less overloaded and can participate more often in the diffusion process .",
    "and @xmath107 at which a particle spreads from @xmath42 to @xmath50 network and gets directly deposited or deposited on a neighboring node respectively . with @xmath108 ( @xmath77 ) , @xmath109 ( @xmath76 ) , @xmath110 ( @xmath75 ) and @xmath111 ( @xmath72).,scaledwidth=49.0% ]     and @xmath112 , that after an external diffusion , the particle gets deposited directly or gets deposited on a neighboring node with degree @xmath4 respectively for @xmath74 . with @xmath113 ( @xmath77 ) , @xmath114 ( @xmath76 ) , @xmath115 ( @xmath75 ) and @xmath116 ( @xmath72).,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    we want to understand the reason that makes the load get rather deposited on low - connectivity nodes when it crosses to a different network . in order to explain this effect we study the diffusion process when the load crosses to the other network .",
    "when a particle spreads from one network to another , it can be directly deposited on a node connected by the external connection or it can be deposited in one of its neighbors . to understand which of these two scenarios is more probable ,",
    "we compute @xmath117 and @xmath107 , which are the rates at which a particle that spreads from one network to another gets deposited directly ( @xmath118 ) or in a neighboring ( @xmath119 ) node respectively .",
    "notice that @xmath120 . in fig .",
    "[ fig.6 ] we plot these rates as a function of @xmath0 and we can see that @xmath117 is more important than @xmath107 , which means that for any @xmath0 , most of the times the particles that cross from one network to another get directly deposited .    in order to explain the last observation",
    ", we define @xmath121 and @xmath112 as the probabilities that , after an external diffusion , the particle gets directly deposited or gets deposited on a neighboring node with degree @xmath4 respectively . in fig .",
    "[ fig.7 ] we plot these probabilities for @xmath74 .",
    "we can see that the probabilities @xmath121 are more homogeneous than @xmath112 and that nodes with low degree are the ones which receive the majority of the particles that are directly deposited .",
    "we can also see that the probabilities @xmath112 , which contemplate the scenario of neighboring deposition , have a wider spectrum , which agrees with the fact that in sf networks there are a few nodes with high degrees that receive the load by diffusion from their neighbors .",
    "this mechanism reduces the fluctuations , due to a matching of the heights of low - degree and high - degree nodes that is more efficient as @xmath0 increases .",
    "finally the system is optimally synchronized for @xmath2 .",
    "we study the synchronization in two sf networks where the dynamic of growth is ruled by a modified srm model .",
    "we study the fluctuations in the steady state of each network as a function of the interacting parameter @xmath0 and we find that the synchronization of each network improves when the interconnection between them increases .",
    "this improvement in both networks is about a @xmath122 better than in isolated networks when @xmath2 , which is an important value regarding the decrease of the fluctuations .",
    "however , we show that the rate of this improvement decrease with the number of interconnections and this can be an useful result in future research to determine if a larger interconnection between networks apart from @xmath2 , is worth it .    on the other hand , the improvement in the synchronization is due mainly to the diffusion through external connections .",
    "we also found that the majority of the particles that travel through the external connections are directly deposited in nodes with low connectivity , which are the majority in sf networks .",
    "we observe that in average these nodes usually have a the lowest heights in a sf network .",
    "then when @xmath0 increases , the height of the nodes with low connectivity increases compared to the mean value and the difference with the height of the hubs decreases .",
    "we also found various distinctive characteristics of the model , such as the fact that the synchronization and the heights of the hubs become almost independent of the internal degree distribution as @xmath0 increase , or the fact that the percentage of particles that diffuse between networks only depends on @xmath0 and not on the internal degree distribution of the networks .",
    "this result indicates that for high values of @xmath0 the behavior of the system is ruled by the interconnection between networks and not by the topology of the system .",
