    "in this paper , we present the main results from an analysis of the kinematic data obtained in the context of a massive _ absolute _ proper - motion survey , the southern proper - motion program ( spm hereafter ) .",
    "our analysis is based on the spm catalog as described by platais et al .",
    "this catalog provides positions , absolute proper - motions , and @xmath7 photometry for about 30,000 randomly selected stars , among other objects , near the south galactic pole .",
    "the sky coverage of the spm catalog is about 720 deg@xmath8 in the magnitude range @xmath9 .",
    "the accuracy of individual absolute proper - motions is 3 - 8  mas  yr@xmath1 depending on the star s magnitude . for a complete description of the catalogue structure , contents , plate measurement and other astrometric / photometric details ,",
    "the reader is referred to girard et al .",
    "( 1998 , paper i ) and platais et al .",
    "( 1998 , paper ii ) .",
    "a detailed analysis of the velocity distribution function , and star- and color - counts for stars from the disk , thick - disk , and halo derived from the spm photometry and astrometry is addressed by mndez et al .",
    "( 1999 , paper iii ) .",
    "the arrangement of this letter is the following : in section  2 we present an overview of the spm photometric and proper - motion data . in section  3",
    "the model used to compare the observed proper - motion distributions with those predicted is described , while section  4 presents the model predictions as compared to the proper - motion data .",
    "section  5 presents the implications of our results for the global mass of the galaxy .",
    "finally , section  6 presents the main conclusions of the paper .",
    "the random sgp - spm sample has been chosen such that , at a given @xmath10 magnitude interval , a fixed number of stars are randomly extracted from all stars available in that magnitude interval . as a result , one - magnitude intervals are chosen in the range @xmath11 for the subsequent analysis . at a given magnitude interval ,",
    "the complete sample and the randomly selected sample differ only by a scale factor",
    ". therefore , color and kinematic properties binned in the proper magnitude intervals should be very similar to those derived from a complete sample , except for the increased uncertainties on the derived values because of the smaller sample - an effect that is fully taken into account in the analysis below .",
    "we model the starcounts concurrently with the kinematics by using the galactic structure and kinematic model presented by mndez and van altena ( 1996 ) .",
    "the starcount model employed here has been tested under many different circumstances , and has proved to be able to predict starcounts that match the observed magnitude and color counts ( in both shape _ and _ number ) to better than 10% , and in many cases to better than 1% .",
    "the kinematic model presented by mndez and van altena ( 1996 ) has also been shown to be able to reproduce the kinematics of disk stars toward different galactic fields . in mndez",
    "et al . ( 1999 ) , a full analysis of the spm - sgp data in terms of star and color - counts , as well as the kinematics is presented .",
    "a basic assumption in the mndez and van altena ( 1996 ) model is that of the gaussian shape of the velocity ellipsoid . while the velocity distribution observed for late - type stars ( e.g. , dehnen 1998 ) is clearly skewed and can not be properly modeled by a gaussian , the error in the predicted median proper motion made by using a shifted gaussian is likely to be small",
    "indeed , mndez et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , show that shifted - gaussian velocity distribution functions do provide a good fit to the full spm proper - motion distributions as a function of apparent magnitude , with perhaps a slight predicted excess of stars with positive proper - motions in the direction of galactic rotation .    because of projection effects near the sgp , our model comparisons are most sensitive to the motions in the direction of galactic rotation ( the so - called v - component ) , and along the galactic center - anticenter direction ( the u - component ) , and _ not _ to the motions perpendicular to the galactic plane ( the w - component ) .",
    "there have been a number of determinations for the solar peculiar motion .",
    "the classical result , quoted in mihalas and binney ( 1981 ) , gives @xmath12  km  s@xmath1 , essentially based upon delhaye s ( 1965 ) compilation .",
    "more recent values for the solar peculiar motion do not seem to have converged to a single value , especially in the v - component .",
    "dehnen and binney ( 1998 ) find @xmath13  km  s@xmath1 from a carefully selected unbiased sample of hipparcos stars , while miyamoto and zhu ( 1998 ) find @xmath14  km  s@xmath1 from 159 cepheids , _ also _ from the hipparcos catalogue .",
    "as suggested earlier by robin and oblak ( 1987 ) , such variation in the @xmath15 component is probably due to difficulties in separating the asymmetric drift from the intrinsic solar motion , and also because of the peculiar motions exhibited by the very young ob stars , which are still moving under the influence of the spiral arm kinematics and/or of their parent molecular cloud .    in 1985 ,",
    "the iau adopted a value for the motion of the lsr of 220  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "kerr and lynden - bell ( 1986 ) have discussed extensively the determinations of @xmath16 , as well as @xmath17 , and the oort constants a and b available until then . from a straight mean of different determinations they obtained @xmath18  km  s@xmath1 ( their table  4 ) , while from independent determinations of @xmath17 ,",
    "a , and b ( their tables  3 and  5 ) , we find @xmath19  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "although the uncertainties involved in @xmath20 are larger than those of @xmath15 , we shall see that the relative motion of disk stars is more affected by uncertainties in the solar peculiar motion than uncertainties in the motion of the lsr , since the whole nearby disk population is approximately co - moving with the lsr .",
    "the basic standard kinematic parameters employed in the model are described in mndez and van altena ( 1996 ) and mndez et al .",
    "the standard model adopts @xmath21  km  s@xmath1 for the peculiar solar motion , and a flat rotation curve with @xmath22  km  s@xmath1 . because we are analyzing data near the sgp",
    ", our model predictions do not span a large range in galactocentric distance , and therefore the model is insensitive to the value adopted for the _ slope _ of the rotation curve near @xmath17 ( although see mndez et al .",
    "1999 ) . as for the disk kinematics",
    ", we have adopted the velocity dispersions given in mndez and van altena ( 1996 ) , with the scale - heights adopted in mndez et al .",
    "( 1999 ) which reproduce the observed spm color- and magnitude counts , a scale - length of 3.5  kpc ( again , the model is not sensitive to this last parameter , as it enters as a function of the galactocentric distance , which for the spm - sgp data is quasi - constant ) , and a value of @xmath23 for the velocity ellipsoid ( see eq .  4 in mndez and van altena 1996 ) ; @xmath23 implies a velocity ellipsoid parallel to the galactic plane at all heights from the galactic plane , while @xmath24 is for a velocity ellipsoid that points towards the galactic center ) . as shown by mndez et al .",
    "( 1999 ) the exact choice of kinematical parameters for the thick - disk and halo are not critical to the conclusions of this letter .",
    "the mean velocity of stars with different velocity dispersion is computed via the proper moments of the collisionless boltzmann equation ( cbe ) .",
    "the cbe allow us to relate our adopted velocity dispersions to the density laws , and to derive an expression for the velocity lag as a function of the net rotation of the disk ( the local lsr ) and the pressure support provided by the velocity dispersions ( see , e.g. , kuijken and gilmore 1989 , gilmore et al .",
    "we must emphasize however that , if the data contain information that is inconsistent with the assumptions made ( in particular , the validity of an axisymmetric cbe , and the neglect of stellar streams ) , then these assumptions inevitably could lead to biased results ",
    "the classical problem of all parametric methods .",
    "figures  ( [ fig1lett ] ) and  ( [ fig2lett ] ) show the model - predicted median absolute proper - motions for the standard model parameters compared to the observations .",
    "these figures clearly show that , while the standard model produces a very good fit to the u - component of the proper - motion ( along the galactocentric direction ) , the v - component ( along galactic rotation ) is grossly underestimated , especially for @xmath25 , where the disk component dominates the overall kinematics .",
    "a radical change in the model predictions occurs when we change the peculiar solar motion from the standard value of @xmath26  km  s@xmath1 to @xmath27  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the largest effect occurs at the brightest bins , i.e. , for nearby disk stars where the solar peculiar motion dominates the reflex motion . on the other hand",
    ", we may keep the conventional solar peculiar velocity , but change the overall rotation speed for the lsr from the iau adopted value of + 220  km  s@xmath1 to + 270  km  s@xmath1 , as suggested by recent hipparcos results ( miyamoto and zhu 1998 ) . in this case , the change in the predicted motion becomes more important at fainter magnitudes where one is sampling objects from the other galactic components located at larger distances , and where the dominant effect is that of the overall rotation of the disk with respect to galaxies , and the relative state of rotation between the different galactic components . at the brightest bins , the effect of changing @xmath28 becomes also noticeable because of the larger fraction of bright giants , which can be seen to large distances and , hence , the differential rotation effects become amplified . a model in which we simultaneously change the solar peculiar motion _ and _ the lsr rotational speed to + 5  km  s@xmath1 and + 270  km  s@xmath1 ,",
    "respectively , produces a much better fit to the observed motions .",
    "we note that , in this model , the velocity lags for the thick - disk and halo are increased in proportion to the increase of the disk s rotational speed , as the net rotation of those two components is kept constant at 180  km  s@xmath1 and 0  km  s@xmath1 , respectively ( for details see mndez et al .",
    "we conclude that a model with @xmath27  km  s@xmath1 and @xmath29  km  s@xmath1 clearly provides a much better fit to the median motion in v than does the standard model with @xmath30  km  s@xmath1 and @xmath31  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the predicted median proper - motion in the u - component shows a good fit to the observed values , and the changes in the v - component described above do not affect this parameter substantially because of the orthogonality of the projection effects toward the galactic poles .",
    "these results do show us , though , that the adopted value for the solar peculiar motion in this direction is the correct one .",
    "figure  ( [ fig1lett ] ) shows the effect of changing the standard @xmath32  km  s@xmath1 by @xmath333  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "an eye - ball fit from figure  ( [ fig1lett ] ) suggests for the u component of the solar motion a value of @xmath34  km  s@xmath1 . also , there is no indication of a local expansion or contraction of the galactic disk , as is also found from the kinematics of local molecular clouds ( belfort and crovisier 1984 ) .",
    "a change of the orientation of the velocity ellipsoids from a cylindrical to a spherical projection tends to produce a slightly larger value for the velocity lag , especially at fainter magnitudes . the upper solid line in fig .",
    "( [ fig2lett ] ) shows that , while the fit of the model to the observed data for @xmath35  km  s@xmath1 , @xmath36  km  s@xmath1 is good at bright magnitudes ( @xmath25 ) , the model underestimates the lag at fainter magnitudes .",
    "however , by changing the orientation of the velocity ellipsoid we can actually increase the lag . this is shown in figure  ( [ fig2lett ] ) where a model with @xmath27  km  s@xmath1 , @xmath36  km  s@xmath1 , and @xmath24 gives a better overall fit to the observed median motion in the v - component than a model with @xmath23 .",
    "the large lsr speed suggested by the spm data poses an interesting problem to dynamical models of the galaxy .",
    "since the lsr is , by definition , in centrifugal equilibrium with the galactic potential , a larger lsr velocity implies a larger mass for the galaxy interior to the solar circle . as emphasized by rohlfs and kreitschmann ( 1988 )",
    ", practically all galactic - mass models follow , to within 10% , the relation :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the mass interior to the radius @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is the circular speed at a distance @xmath39 from the galactic center .",
    "we see that an increase in the lsr speed from 220  km  s@xmath1 to 270  km  s@xmath1 would imply as much as 50% more mass interior to the solar circle .",
    "is there any other evidence that this might be plausible ?",
    "an indication that this is perhaps not only possible but , indeed , dynamically required , comes from a recent measurement of the absolute proper - motions of the large magellanic clouds ( lmc ) by anguita et al .",
    "they have used qsos as an inertial reference frame to obtain absolute proper - motions of stars in three fields toward the lmc .",
    "the proper - motions are based on ccd frames taken at 7 to 12 epochs spanning eight years , with a mean accuracy for the proper - motions from these three fields of @xmath41  mas  yr@xmath1 .",
    "their derived motion for the lmc is larger than that inferred by previous photographic studies that have used either bright stars or extended galaxies as a reference frame .",
    "anguita et al .",
    "derive a mass for the milky way out to 50  kpc of @xmath42 , in contrast to previous determinations ( e.g. , lin and lynden - bell 1982 ) that implied a value of @xmath43 .",
    "anguita s result is fully consistent with our findings : galactic mass models predict that the mass interior to the solar circle is only about 4% of the total galactic mass ( rohlfs and kreitschmann 1988 ) . the range of mass values found by anguita et al .",
    "implies , through eq .",
    "( 1 ) for @xmath44  kpc , a rotational velocity at the solar galactocentric distance in the range @xmath45  km  s@xmath1 , which indeed brackets our results .",
    "interestingly enough , a mass of @xmath46 implies a very improbable rotational speed of 120  km  s@xmath1 .    on the other hand",
    ", our derived value for @xmath28 seems to be in conflict with a recent determination of the proper motion of sgr  a@xmath47 by reid et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and backer & sramek ( 1999 ) who find @xmath48 ( employing the good assumption that sgr  a@xmath47 is at rest ) , which would require @xmath17 larger than 9  kpc , inconsistent with almost all previous determinations .",
    "could this inconsistency point , perhaps , to evidence against our basic model assumptions which would then lead to a biased @xmath28 ?",
    "recently , zaritsky ( 1999 ) has reviewed most of the evidence regarding the mass of the galactic halo and , by extension , the total mass of the galaxy .",
    "he points out that a squared ratio of rotational circular velocities of 1.5 ( such as that found from the 220 to 270  km  s@xmath1 ) is not considered a serious discrepancy in the modeling of the total galactic mass .",
    "he furthermore points out that timing arguments involving the relative motion of m  31 and the milky  way imply a mass for the latter of @xmath49 .",
    "a similar argument , based on the leo  i - milky - way system , leads to a mass of @xmath50 . in both cases ,",
    "the analysis excludes angular momentum , overlapping mass distributions at earlier times , and the evolution ( growth ) of the galactic halo with age , all of which would lead to an increased total mass .",
    "zaritsky also reviews an extension of the two - body calculations into the larger environment , which leads to an even larger mass , in the range @xmath51 , concluding that all this evidence implies a mass out to @xmath52  kpc of @xmath53 .",
    "thus , anguita s results based on the lmc proper motions , and its correspondence to our findings , are in line with zaritsky s arguments .",
    "we have used the distribution of absolute proper motions of @xmath54 randomly selected stars , part of the southern proper motion survey , to constrain a structural & kinematic model of the galaxy .",
    "the absolute proper - motions in the u - component indicate a solar peculiar motion of @xmath2  km  s@xmath1 , with no need for a local expansion or contraction term . in the v - component",
    ", the absolute proper - motions can only be satisfactorily reproduced by the model if we adopt a solar peculiar motion of + 5  km  s@xmath1 , a large lsr speed of 270  km  s@xmath1 , and a ( disk ) velocity ellipsoid that always points towards the galactic center .",
    "the larger than expected lsr speed leads to a larger mass for the galaxy interior to the solar circle by a factor of about 1.5 .",
    "this is compared with other recent evidence indicating that the milky - way might indeed be more massive than previously thought .",
    "this evidence comes mainly from a new measurement of the proper motion of the lmc ( anguita et al . 1999 ) and from the binary motion ( `` timing argument '' ) of the m31 - milky way and leo  i - milky way pairs ( zaritsky 1999 ) .",
    "our larger lsr speed is also coincident with a similar finding by miyamoto and zhu ( 1998 ) using o - b5 stars and cepheids from the hipparcos catalogue .",
    "we stress that our result of a large lsr speed rests crucially on the assumptions of both axisymmetry and equilibrium dynamics .",
    "failure to meet these conditions would lead to inconsistencies , such as those related to the solar - galactocentric distance indicated at the end of section  4.2 .",
    "high accuracy proper motion measurements for the smc , and proper motions for some of the nearby dwarf spheroidals will help in confirming a larger value for the mass of the galaxy , while future space interferometric space missions like fame ( http://www.usno.navy.mil/fame ) , gaia ( http://astro.estec.esa.nl/gaia/ ) , and sim ( http://sim.jpl.nasa.gov/ ) , will directly measure the disk rotational speed across the entire galaxy .    the spm is a joint project of the universidad nacional de san juan , argentina and the yale southern observatory . financial support for the spm has been provided by the us nsf and the unsj through its observatorio astronmico `` flix aguilar '' .",

    "carlos e. lpez , who participated in , and supervised , all of the spm second - epoch observations .",
    "we are indebted to an anonymous referee who provided many useful comments on the limitations and potentialities of the galactic model employed here .",
