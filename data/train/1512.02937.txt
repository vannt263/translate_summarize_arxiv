    "to characterize small - number effects in a chemical reaction system , we begin by focusing on the stationary distribution of the system . here",
    ", we consider only a system under a well - mixed condition , by ignoring spatial inhomogeneity . taking the concept of a ` small number ' literally",
    ", the effect we are addressing is not expected to emerge in a `` macroscopic '' system , and thus should vanish as the number of molecules in the system approaches infinity .",
    "in addition , we are not interested in a truly `` microscopic '' phenomenon that would emerge under a situation with an extremely low number of molecules , i.e. , @xmath0 , in which discreteness in the number is dominant . here , we specifically address the phenomenon at a `` mesoscopic '' level , in which stochasticity and molecular discreteness at the `` microscopic '' level exert an influence on a larger scale , but the effect disappears at a macroscopic level .",
    "typically , this effect would be observed at a scale larger than dozens of molecules , and much smaller than the avogadro number .",
    "we postulate the following two requirements for a chemical reaction system satisfying the conditions of interest .",
    "( i ) the ergodicity condition is satisfied and there exists a unique stationary state ; hence , divergence in the molecular concentration or the existence of absorbing states is excluded .",
    "( ii ) the discrete probability distribution function @xmath1 of the number of each chemical species @xmath2 is well approximated by the continuous probability distribution function @xmath3 of the concentrations @xmath4 , in which the concentration of each chemical @xmath5 is defined by @xmath6 , according to the volume of the system @xmath7 .",
    "more concretely , we assume that the time evolution of the probability function is well described by the chemical fokker - planck equation  @xcite , which is derived from the master equation .    from the requirement ( ii ) , we start from the chemical fokker - planck equation . the stationary distribution @xmath8 is expected to have the following expression : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the leading order term and @xmath11 is the remnant term .",
    "this indicates that @xmath8 approaches @xmath12 for an infinitely large volume @xmath13 .",
    "consequently , @xmath8 has peaks at maxima of @xmath14 .",
    "correspondingly , for this limit , @xmath15 obeys the rate equation , the information of which is contained only in @xmath14 .",
    "asymptotically in the limit , small gaussian fluctuations of the order @xmath16 exist around the maxima , as demonstrated by van kampen s @xmath7 expansion  @xcite .",
    "this behavior of @xmath15 at the limit and its asymptotic behaviors are regarded as `` macroscopic '' phenomena .    on the other hand , for small @xmath7 ,",
    "@xmath11 could be of a comparable or dominant order compared to @xmath10 for a certain range of @xmath15 .",
    "this may result in a drastic change in the distribution , where @xmath17 is distinguishable from the behavior for @xmath13 ; this leads to a small - number effect .",
    "the definition of the drastic change will be given below , following derivation of the specific forms of @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "to define the criterion for the small - number effect , for simplicity , we consider the case of a one - dimensional system that can be described by a one - step markov process .",
    "extension to multi - dimensional systems is rather straightforward if the detailed balance condition is assumed in addition to assumptions ( i ) and ( ii ) above ( see supplemental materials ) .",
    "the time evolution of the probability @xmath20 of the number @xmath21 of a chemical is given by the following master equation : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the transition probabilities for @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "applying the kramers - moyal expansion and ignoring orders higher than @xmath27 , the chemical fokker - planck equation for the probability @xmath28 of concentration @xmath29 is obtained as follows : @xmath30 in which @xmath31 , or at least @xmath32 , is assumed from requirement ( ii ) . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cfp ] ) , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the first and second moments of the transition probability , respectively , and can be expanded as @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 indicate a coefficient of @xmath38 and @xmath39 term with @xmath29 , respectively . the @xmath39 order term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : moment1 ] ) results from reactions with a reaction order higher than two ( e.g. , @xmath40 in @xmath41 or @xmath42 ) . from the boundary condition for the reflecting wall @xmath43 at @xmath44 , which is derived from the postulate that @xmath21 can not be negative , the stationary distribution @xmath45 of eq",
    "( [ eq : cfp ] ) is given by @xmath46 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is a normalization constant .",
    "defining @xmath48 @xmath45 can be obtained as a form of eq.([eq : pst ] ) .",
    "the derivatives of @xmath49 and @xmath50 are given as @xmath51 the corresponding rate equation is then written as @xmath52 .    here , we define @xmath53 as the range within which the inequality @xmath54 is satisfied ; i.e. , in this range , @xmath55 is dominant over @xmath56 .",
    "obviously , @xmath53 can not be a macroscopic scale , since @xmath50 can not be dominant for an infinitely large @xmath7 .",
    "it is important to note that since the concentration @xmath5 is defined by @xmath6 , and the genuine distribution @xmath57 is discrete , the distribution @xmath8 in eq.([eq : pst ] ) is invalid for a scale of @xmath58 smaller than @xmath59 .",
    "thus , the relevant resolution of @xmath5 in eq.([eq : pst ] ) is nearly @xmath60 .",
    "hence , if @xmath53 is smaller than @xmath60 , this effect can not be observed within a meaningful range ( e.g. , in a stochastic simulation by the gillespie algorithm  @xcite ) , and the effect is therefore regarded as representing a `` microscopic '' phenomenon . if @xmath61 ( i.e. , the range @xmath53 is in the order of several number of molecules ) ,",
    "the effect is also regarded as representing a `` microscopic '' phenomenon .",
    "if @xmath62 , we define the emergence of the small - number effect within @xmath53 as a `` mesoscopic '' phenomenon .",
    "specifically , in the following section , we assume that the system can show the small - number effect if @xmath63 can be arbitrarily increased by tuning of the kinetic constants or @xmath7 .",
    "note that we assume that the reaction order can not be arbitrarily large , because many - body reaction higher than four is quite unrealistic .",
    "the peaks of @xmath8 can be shifted owing to the small - number effect .",
    "a peak for @xmath13 is given by @xmath64 , which is a stable fixed point of the rate equation ( i.e. , @xmath65 ) , whereas that for finite @xmath7 is given by @xmath66 , which is a solution of @xmath67 .",
    "only when @xmath68 ( i.e. , @xmath69 can be arbitrarily larger than @xmath60 ) , we consider that the observed shift represents a `` mesoscopic phenomenon '' .",
    "using the criterion proposed above , we can now determine whether or not a given chemical reaction system will exhibit the small - number effect . here , instead of focusing only on one specific chemical reaction system",
    ", we address a more general question : what type of network topologies can be expected to show small - number effects ? to answer this question , we consider all possible chemical reaction systems consisting of one or two chemical species , and for each topology , we examine whether or not the small - number effects can emerge according to the proposed criterion .     and @xmath70 for each motif in the list is given in the supplemental materials . , width=264 ]    the resulting motif list is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : list ] .",
    "the network motifs a - d represent chemical reaction systems with one chemical species ; an arrow pointing out of ( into ) the box represents annihilation ( creation ) of a molecule , whereas an arrow pointing to another arrow indicates that the molecule also acts as a catalyst of the reaction .",
    "the motifs e - n represent chemical reaction systems with two chemical species , in which the total number of molecules is conserved ; an arrow connecting one circle to another circle indicates a substrate - product relationship , whereas an arrow connecting a circle to another arrow indicates that the reaction is catalyzed by the molecule represented by the circle .",
    "note that for a motif with an autocatalytic reaction ( e.g. , c , d , or f ) , the reactions will stop once the number of autocatalytic molecules becomes zero , and thus such a motif can not satisfy the ergodicity condition ( i ) . to prevent this ergodicity - breaking",
    ", the creation of molecule @xmath71 was added to motifs c and d , whereas @xmath72 or @xmath73 was added to the motifs f , h , i , j , l , m , and n.    analysis for each motif is demonstrated in the following section and in supplemental materials .",
    "the `` + + '' symbol in fig .",
    "[ fig : list ] indicates a motif that can potentially show a small - number effect at the lowest reaction order , whereas a `` + '' motif can not show a small - number effect at the lowest reaction order , but can show such effects at a higher order .",
    "for instance , motif d , which consists of @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 with integer reaction orders @xmath77 and @xmath78 , is marked as `` + '' in fig .",
    "[ fig : list ] , because the motif can not show the small - number effect for the lowest reaction order @xmath79 , @xmath80 but can show the effect for @xmath81 .",
    "the `` - '' symbol indicates a motif that can not show the small - number effect for any choice of kinetic constant or volume size , unless the reaction order is unrealistically high .",
    "we here provide detailed examples of motif analysis for three representative motifs of a chemical reaction system ; analysis of all other motifs is presented in the supplemental materials .",
    "the first example does not show the small - number effect for any choice of parameters , the second example shows a power - law tail distribution as well as a shift in the peak position due to the small - number effect , and the third example shows the emergence of multi - modality , as reported in @xcite .",
    "the first example is motif a in fig.[fig : list ] , which consists of one chemical species , x , and the following two chemical reactions : @xmath82 { } \\emptyset , & \\ \\",

    "( [ eq : ast ] ) is then written as @xmath87 , implying that the range @xmath53 , satisfying eq .",
    "( [ eq : ast ] ) , is narrower than @xmath60 . therefore , @xmath50 can not be dominant for any choice of @xmath88 and @xmath7 , and thus the small - number effect can not emerge in this motif .",
    "the shift of the peak due to the contribution of @xmath89 is calculated as @xmath90 , indicating that the magnitude of the shift is less than one molecule , which is consistent with our claim that this motif does not show the small - number effect .",
    "next , we consider the case of motif c , which is obtained by addition of the positive feedback reaction @xmath91 to motif a , where @xmath92 is a positive integer .",
    "note that the reaction @xmath74 is necessary because a system without this reaction has an absorbing state @xmath93 , which is not allowed according to requirement ( i ) .",
    "this motif can show the small - number effect even for the lowest reaction order @xmath79 .",
    "for the case of @xmath79 , the transition probability is given as @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the rate constant of the positive feedback , which satisfies @xmath96 from requirement ( i ) , since @xmath29 diverges at the rate equation for @xmath97 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath98 and @xmath99 are calculated as @xmath100 denoting the peak of @xmath101 by @xmath102 , the condition for eq .",

    "note that the first two reactions are necessary to satisfy the ergodicity condition , because the absence of either reaction gives rise to an absorbing state .",
    "since the total number of molecules @xmath114 is conserved throughout the above reactions , @xmath114 is set to be identical to a unitless volume @xmath7 via proper transformation . by denoting @xmath21 as the number of @xmath83 molecules and @xmath115 as the number of @xmath116 molecules , the transition probabilities of @xmath25 and @xmath26 are given as @xmath117 the corresponding @xmath98 and @xmath99",
    "are calculated as @xmath118 then , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ast ] ) is written as @xmath119 where @xmath120 .",
    "for simplicity , we focus on the case with @xmath121 and @xmath122 , from which eq .  ( [ eq : ast ] ) is rewritten as @xmath123 .",
    "this implies that @xmath124 $ ] for @xmath125 , and @xmath126 otherwise .",
    "specifically , for @xmath127 and @xmath128 , @xmath63 is sufficiently larger than @xmath129 because @xmath130 ; thus , this motif can show the small - number effect . in this case ,",
    "@xmath131 and @xmath132 are calculated as @xmath133 where the former distribution is unimodal , whereas the latter is bimodal . at the critical value @xmath134 ,",
    "@xmath135 is zero for the entire region of @xmath58 , and thus the distribution is uniform .",
    "thus , by decreasing the total number of molecules , bimodality in the distribution function @xmath45 emerges , and switching behavior between @xmath44 and @xmath136 correspondingly appears in the time series , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : for_motif_i ] .    .",
    "the left panel illustrates the time series of @xmath137 , and the right panel shows the probability distribution of the concentration .",

    "analytical and numerical results are overlapped completely.,width=283 ]",
    "as confirmed numerically , our proposed criterion could successfully predict the small - number effect at a `` mesoscopic '' scale .",
    "the representative examples outlined above show not only the emergence of multi - modality ( e.g. in motif i ) but also the emergence of a power - law tail distribution ( and corresponding bursting behavior in the time series ) in motif c , as illustrated in fig .  [ fig : for_motifc ] .",
    "although the emergence of the power - law tail due to self - organized criticality has been reported previously  @xcite using complex chemical reaction networks , our present finding does not rely on this mechanism .",
    "we consider that motif c can serve as a minimal model to exhibit the emergence of the power law due to the small - number effect .",
    "although we adopted the chemical fokker - planck equation , which is relevant to continuous variables , we also incorporated information of the discrete nature of molecule numbers as a resolution in the variables , which resulted in the criterion @xmath62 . with this criterion ,",
    "microscopic phenomena are successfully excluded from the small - number effect .",
    "for instance , the shift of the peak in motif a , which was predicted by the chemical fokker - planck equation , was concluded to not be relevant at a mesoscopic scale .",
    "this demonstrates that a given phenomenon described in the chemical fokker - planck equation does not always indicate a mesoscopic phenomenon , and that phenomenon occurring at every scale can be included in the equation .",
    "therefore , the proposed treatment could successfully combine the analysis of a continuous equation for molecular concentration with the information of discreteness in molecule number . from this aspect ,",
    "our study is different from previous works on noise - induced transitions  @xcite , which focus on the impact of the noise effect on the distribution of the langevin equation . in these previous studies ,",
    "the elemental process behind the langevin equation was ignored , and thereby information of the molecular discreteness was also disregarded ; thus , the microscopic and mesoscopic phenomena could not be distinguished .",
    "for example , the noise - induced transition framework predicts the shift of the peak for all the motifs in fig . 1 , whereas for motifs classified as ( - ) the shift can not be observed at a mesoscopic scale .",
    "note that the derivation of chemical fokker - planck is not `` systematic '' in the sense of perturbation theory , which is in contrast to the linear noise approximation ( lna ) derived by the van kampen s expansion  @xcite .",
    "here we adopted chemical fokker - planck equation , that is also derived from the chemical langevin equation@xcite .",
    "as is discussed in introduction , recent numerical studies support the validity of chemical fokker - planck equation up to smaller value of @xmath7 than the range adopted for lna@xcite .",
    "in fact , we also demonstrated that the direct numerical simulations agree quite well with the predictions of chemical fokker - planck equation for all motifs marked by `` + '' or `` + + '' in fig.1 , where small - number effects are well reproduced by the chemical fokker - planck equation , rather than by the lna .    the list of networks shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : list ] indicates that motifs showing the small - number effect always involve an autocatalytic reaction ( positive feedback ) , which in turn suggests that autocatalysis is an essential structure for the emergence of the small - number effect .",
    "in addition , comparison of motif c with d or motif j with l suggests that an auto - repressive reaction ( negative feedback ) tends to prevent emergence of the small - number effect .",
    "indeed , most of the previous studies that reported small - number effects considered chemical reactions containing autocatalysis  @xcite .",
    "the small - number effect illustrated here demonstrates that the number of molecules , rather than the concentration , can drastically alter the stationary state of the system .",
    "moreover , the reversal of the current of a chemical reaction has been reported  @xcite due to the small - number effect .",
    "these examples suggest a novel way of regulating a chemical reaction , that is , regulation based on the number of molecules ( or equivalently volume size ) .",
    "this number - based regulation can be further extended to consider the effective number of molecules , rather than the total number of molecules , where ` effective ' means the number of molecules that can join together in a chemical reaction under a restricted condition .",
    "for example , under a molecular crowding condition , each molecule is accessible to only a small number of surrounding molecules , which may induce the small - number effect , as reported here .",
    "in this paper , we define the small - number effect of a well - stirred system as a mesoscopic phenomenon by focusing on the stationary distribution , and propose a criterion for determining whether or not this effect can emerge in a given chemical reaction network . by examining all possible chemical reaction networks consisting of one or two chemical species ,",
    "we have provided a list of the network motifs of a chemical reaction that can potentially show the small - number effect .",
    "the motifs considered herein are quite simple and can thus easily be incorporated as a subpart for a complex , real biochemical reaction network .",
    "for example , similar biochemical reactions to motif i have been studied in several biological contexts  @xcite .",
    "the list of motifs provided herein should be helpful in searching for other candidates of biochemical reactions in which the small - number effect is expected to play an important role within a cell .",
    "furthermore , considering recent advances in synthetic biology  @xcite , the list is also expected to be useful for designing a system that shows the small - number effect .",
    "of course , our criterion can also be applied to larger network motifs using the criterion described for a multivariable system given in the supplemental materials .",
    "extensions of our theory to reaction - diffusion systems will be an important issue in the future .",

    "<S> i.e. , when the volume size of a system and the number of contained molecules is large , the overall behaviors of the system can be described by the deterministic rate equation of reaction dynamics for the average concentration of chemicals , or a langevin equation that takes into account small gaussian fluctuation around it </S>",

    "<S> these phenomena are induced by molecular discreteness and its associated stochasticity , designated as `` small - number effects '' or `` discreteness - induced transitions '' , which are exemplified by the emergence of multi - modality  @xcite , reversal of reaction current  @xcite and slow relaxation  @xcite .    in spite of the several examples of small - number effects reported to date , there is no unified understanding of these phenomena . </S>",

    "<S> the term `` trivial discreteness effect '' is used for describing the trivial discrepancy between a continuous and discrete value ; the discrete number divided by the volume does not exactly match with the continuous concentration value in the rate equation . in general , any chemical reaction system can show such deviation from the rate equation and specifically the effect is apparent for a system at a microscopic scale with an extremely small number of molecule ( 0,1,2 , ... ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it naturally raises the following question : what is the difference between a trivial discreteness effect and the previously reported small - number effect ?    in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the discreteness - induced phenomena that can emerge at a `` mesoscopic '' level , which is clearly larger than the microscopic level ( i.e. , the scale at which the trivial discreteness effect occurs ) but smaller than the macroscopic level , because at the mesoscopic level , the trivial discreteness effect vanishes and only salient phenomena that are relevant at a continuous concentration level remain . </S>",
    "<S> for this purpose , different volume sizes with accordingly different numbers of contained molecules are considered for each chemical reaction system . </S>",
    "<S> the mesoscopic phenomena can be prominent even in the situation where hundreds of molecules exist , which is clearly out of the discrete region ; thus , it is reasonable to expect that these phenomena may be relevant in various cellular situations such as the chemical reactions occurring in fine intra - cellular structures . after introducing the concept of the mesoscopic scale </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a criterion for determining whether or not the discreteness - induced phenomena can emerge at the mesoscopic level , and characterize such phenomena occurring at the mesoscopic level as the small - number effect . </S>",
    "<S> thus , this criterion enables prediction of whether the small - number effect will emerge in a given chemical reaction network . rather than applying the proposed criterion to one specific system , we here apply it to a general class of chemical reaction systems , and systematically provide a list of the network motifs of chemical reactions that are expected to show the small - number effect . furthermore , through motif analysis , we confirm that a previously reported system  @xcite also falls into the motif that is predicted to show the mesoscopic small - number effect . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , this analysis revealed that a motif involving an autocatalytic reaction ( positive feedback ) can potentially show the small - number effect , whereas one with an auto - repressive reaction ( negative feedback ) tends to weaken the small - number effect . </S>",
