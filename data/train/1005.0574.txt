    "the kinematics of an off - axis neutrino beam in the approximation where the parent meson beam is divergenceless was posed as a problem to the student in these archives a long time ago .",
    "however , the author of @xcite seems not to have noticed that the problem is amenable to an exact treatment which reveals interesting aspects hidden by the approximations he uses . in this note , we show how to implement exactly the lorentz transformation in the differential ( angle , energy ) distribution and we exhibit some features of the results .",
    "+ among others , it is shown that a sizeable part of the flux at a given lab angle comes from neutrinos going backwards in the center of mass frame of the decaying meson .",
    "given the approximations made in @xcite , it is not clear that they are taken into account in the results presented .",
    "how this might have a bearing on the calculations of neutrino fluxes being performed with more realistic divergent meson beams in the preparation of upcoming experiments is unknown to the present author .",
    "starred variables refer to the c.o.m . frame ( com ) of the decaying meson .",
    "+ the neutrino energy in the lab is @xmath0 and its angle with respect to the beam axis is @xmath1 in the lab and @xmath2 in the decaying meson frame . for illustrative purposes",
    ", we use a @xmath3 proton beam energy corresponding to the t2k experiment and a pion spectrum of the form @xmath4 as done in @xcite",
    "@xmath5 + or + @xmath6 + with @xmath7 and + @xmath8 + in the second and third cases , @xmath9 which is henceforth the neutrino com energy is not fixed by the conservation laws , but it makes little difference in what follows , except that the lab energy is not rigidly related to the lab angle and meson velocity . + also note that for @xmath10 decays , the divergenceless hypothesis does not hold since @xmath10 s are themselves produced in meson decays . the forthcoming analysis should therefore be amended in this case .",
    "+ for the two - body case , we take @xmath11 as our paradygm : + @xmath12 and @xmath13 together with @xmath14 imply that + @xmath15 and @xmath16 +",
    "we take the decaying meson direction as polar axis in the following , and consider the meson beam as divergenceless .",
    "+ consequently we shall not make use of the azimuthal degree of freedom and reduce the problem to two dimensions .",
    "+ the neutrino energy - momentum vector in com is therefore @xmath17 + let @xmath18 be the @xmath19 lorentz factor and @xmath20 its velocity for @xmath21 + the lab neutrino energy - momentum vector is given by : + @xmath22    we set @xmath23 since our neutrinos are evidently considered as massless here .",
    "this is not an approximation when only these kinematics are considered . to see , it is enough to remember that the neutrino lorentz @xmath24 in the @xmath19 rest frame is @xmath25 for a @xmath26 neutrino , whilst the @xmath24 of a @xmath27 @xmath19 is @xmath28    from this follows :    @xmath29    all these equations are inversed by the substitution @xmath30 and @xmath31 + the relation for @xmath32 following from ( [ ct ] and [ st ] ) has no interest .",
    "however , a complete picture of the relation @xmath31 is obtained by using @xmath33 which yields :    @xmath34    which shows that one angle is a monotonous function of the other on the complete @xmath35 $ ] interval , notwithstanding the well known headlight effect . + the following useful relations",
    "should also be noted :    @xmath36",
    "from equation ( [ st ] ) one sees that @xmath37 and therefore @xmath38 which shows that a given neutrino energy @xmath0 can only be found up to a maximum lab angle @xmath39 which is small for most neutrinos .",
    "+ conversely , at a given angle @xmath1 from the ( supposedly divergenceless ) beam , the maximum neutrino energy is : @xmath40    this bound is valid , of course , for not too small angles . using ( [ en2 ] )",
    ", we can retrieve it more accurately by calculating @xmath41 at fixed @xmath42 to get : @xmath43    it follows that the maximum lab energy at fixed @xmath42 is obtained for @xmath44 .",
    "this correspond to @xmath45 and we find , using again ( [ en2 ] ) , that @xmath46 in conformity with ( [ emx ] ) .",
    "these relations are illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig : enufpi ]    so , although the bound seems to be independant of the beam , it makes sense only if there exist pions with @xmath47 and ( [ emx ] ) must be complemented by the restriction @xmath48 + the stationnarity of @xmath49 will result in many neutrinos emitted by pions around that value of @xmath24 to pile up at the same lab energy @xmath50 .",
    "since they come from pions with @xmath24 s both below and above @xmath51 , they are emitted both forwards and backwards in the pion frame .",
    "we will find the distributions of both components presently .",
    "+ for larger pion energies , neutrinos at angle @xmath1 with respect to the axis are emitted more and more backwards in com with the result that their lab energy slightly decreases with @xmath52 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : enufpi ] ) + in an analogous manner , we can retrieve the bound ( [ thm ] ) by using ( [ en2 ] ) to calculate the derivative @xmath53 at fixed @xmath0 .",
    "we find : @xmath54 and the minimum @xmath42 at fixed lab energy is @xmath55 so that again , the stationnarity wrt @xmath24 will result in a piling up around @xmath42 of neutrinos coming from pions with energies around @xmath56 .",
    "this is illustrated by the distributions ( derived below ) plotted on fig .",
    "[ fig : cdist ]",
    "in this subsection , we consider that the decaying meson velocity is fixed . therefore there is but one final state variable for a 2-body decay ( not counting the azimuth ) and the lab angular distribution is completely determined even in the case of 3-body decay of the parent meson .      by differentiating ( [ inv ] ) with respect to @xmath42 , we find @xmath57    since the meson is spinless it decays isotropically in com and the @xmath58 distribution is flat on the interval @xmath59 $ ]    the lab distribution of the cosine for a given meson energy is thus :    @xmath60    this distribution is valid without change for 3-body decays .      equations ( [ en ] ) and ( [ ct ] ) allow to calculate all the necessary partial derivatives : + @xmath61    from which we get the jacobian : @xmath62    so assuming some energy distribution @xmath63 for @xmath9 ( independant of the angles by isotropy ) we get : @xmath64    for 2-body meson decays , there is only one variable ( @xmath65 is a dirac @xmath66 ) and this reduces to the angular distribution given in ( [ dbl ] ) after elimination of @xmath66 ; the result can alternatively be expressed as a distribution in energy .",
    "+ for 3-body meson decays , @xmath65 must be found from the decay dynamics . from ( [ en ] ) and ( [ mag ] ) @xmath50 for a given angle",
    "is given by @xmath67 with + @xmath68 obtained when the mass of the system recoiling against the neutrino in com is minimal .",
    "we no longer consider that the energy of the parent meson is fixed .",
    "we assume an energy distribution , say @xmath69 for the @xmath19 mesons in the lab .",
    "note that we use @xmath19 for definiteness .",
    "when it comes to 3-body decays , @xmath70 would be more appropriate .",
    "+ even assuming constant @xmath9 ( 2-body decay ) , the two final state variables @xmath0 and @xmath42 can now vary separately . to derive their distribution , we need the jacobian of the transformation @xmath71 +      when performing this transformation , @xmath9 must be considered as a fixed parameter . in the case of 3-body",
    "decays , the @xmath73 distribution found below will be simply multiplied by the @xmath9 com distribution and integrated over this variable .",
    "+ it is much simpler to calculate the partial derivatives of the final variables with respect to @xmath52 and @xmath58 than the contrary .",
    "all we need is again contained in the two relations ( [ en ] ) and ( [ ct ] ) and the relation @xmath74 the necessary derivatives are as follows :    @xmath75    therefore we get :    @xmath76    using the relations established above , the inverse jacobian reduces to :    @xmath77    which , not surprisingly , is singular when @xmath55 , corresponding to @xmath78 +      to get the final @xmath79 distribution for given @xmath9 , we must invert the relation yielding @xmath80 as a function of @xmath81 . this",
    "is done as follows : + from ( [ ct ] ) and ( [ st ] ) one easily deduce the following equations :    @xmath82    we further define : @xmath83 so that ( [ st ] ) reads @xmath84 + hence ( [ gm1 ] ) and ( [ be1 ] ) become : @xmath85 with @xmath86 according to whether @xmath87 or @xmath88 , that is , @xmath89 or @xmath90 ( cf .",
    "( [ inv ] ) ) ; observe that ( [ be1 ] ) implies that @xmath58 is always smaller than @xmath42 .",
    "other constraints on @xmath91 and @xmath24 are automatically obeyed by the expressions ( [ gm1 ] ) and ( [ be1 ] ) + we also get from ( [ be2 ] ) @xmath92    this allows us to rewrite the jacobian in terms of laboratory neutrino variables as : @xmath93    to see when each of the two _ a priori _ possible values of @xmath58 apply , we observe first that ( [ en ] ) and ( [ en2 ] ) show that the physical range of @xmath94 is @xmath95\\ ] ]    further , these two equations allow us to write @xmath42 and @xmath58 as functions of @xmath94 and the boost parameters as follows : @xmath96 the expression for @xmath58 solves the @xmath97 problem :    * for @xmath98 the two signs of @xmath58 are possible since we can ( if the beam permits ! ) have @xmath99 and @xmath100 the first case corresponds to a lower energy meson with the neutrino going forward in its rest frame , whilst the second means a more energetic meson needed to compensate the backward projection of the neutrino in this frame . * for @xmath101",
    "there is but one possibility left , corresponding to + @xmath102 * for @xmath103 , only the @xmath104 solution exists . when @xmath105 , @xmath106 * @xmath107 corresponds to neutrinos going backwards in the lab .",
    "this is where we diverge from the treatment of @xcite .",
    "equation @xmath108 of this author seems to imply that only the @xmath109 contribution is taken into account .",
    "however , @xmath110 corresponds to @xmath111 which is generally very small , so that a sizeable number of almost forward neutrinos can be forgotten here .",
    "[ fig : endist1 ] strikingly illustrates this remark .",
    "+ therefore , to get the joint distribution for @xmath112 we must add the contributions of these two solutions when both apply .",
    "the joint distribution for @xmath52 and @xmath113 which is simply @xmath114 is transformed to :    @xmath115 \\left [ g(m_{\\pi}\\gamma_+)|{\\cos{\\theta}}-\\sqrt{1-r^2{\\sin{\\theta}}^2}|+g(m_{\\pi}\\gamma_-)|{\\cos{\\theta}}+\\sqrt{1-r^2{\\sin{\\theta}}^2}|\\right ] \\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    where @xmath116 means ( [ gm2 ] ) with @xmath86 and _ only the second term is to be kept if @xmath117 _ .",
    "+ this must be multiplied by the probability density of @xmath9 and integrated over it to get the final distribution in ( @xmath118 ) . in the case of a 2-body decay , this results in the mere replacement @xmath119 in ( [ fin ] ) , where the value of @xmath120 stems from the conservation laws .",
    "figures   [ fig : endist1 ] , [ fig : endist2 ] and [ fig : cdist ] show the behaviour expected for constant @xmath0 or constant @xmath42 .",
    "the last displays jacobian peaks at @xmath121 corresponding to the limits explicited in ( [ thm ] ) .",
    "the first shows the same phenomenon for fixed @xmath1 with piling up at @xmath122 in conformity with ( [ emx ] ) the effect seems to disappear ( fig  [ fig : endist2 ] ) for @xmath123 .",
    "as explained after equation ( [ emx ] ) , the limit ( in @xmath0 ) and the concomitant jacobian peak exists only if pions of energy larger than @xmath56 are present in the beam . with @xmath124 and the spectrum shape adopted here ,",
    "this corresponds to @xmath125 .",
    "however , the pion spectrum decreases sharply before this limit .",
    "+ note that although the contribution of neutrinos going backwards in the pion rest frame dies off when going to smaller angles due to the scarcity of energetic pions , they concentrate at @xmath126 , reinforcing the peak which exists already in the distribution of neutrinos going forward in this frame .",
    "equation ( [ fin ] ) is the final result of this paper .",
    "it shows that there exist in general ( for @xmath127 ) two contributions to the spectrum of neutrinos emitted at a given laboratory angle , provided the meson beam is energetic enough to bring the neutrino emitted backwards in the meson frame to the required forward angle . in fig .",
