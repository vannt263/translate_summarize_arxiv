    "polarization effects enter our everyday life .",
    "it is a phenomenon playing a crucial role in tvs , laptops , tablets and smart - phones , and `` 3d vision '' technology .",
    "polarization is one of the fundamental properties of electromagnetic waves , and thus light .",
    "the most elementary theoretical introduction to the notion is via a linearly polarized plane wave solution of maxwell equations in vacuum @xmath1 where the notation has the standard meaning .",
    "the polarization vector @xmath2 is always of unit length .",
    "the value of amplitude @xmath3 , and thus intensity ( the poynting vector ) does not affect polarization of the wave .",
    "stokes introduced his parameters to characterize polarization of arbitrary states of classical light .",
    "the quantum versions are straightforward application of his ideas .",
    "essentially , if one assumes that the registered average intensity is proportional to the number of photons , that is , it is an averaged photon - number operator , the usual quantum stokes parameters read : @xmath4,\\ ] ] where @xmath5 are annihilation operator of photons of polarization @xmath6 , @xmath7 plays the same role for the orthogonal polarization , and the index @xmath6 denotes three complementary polarization analysis arrangements ( e.g. horizontal - vertical , diagonal - antidiagonal and right - left handed circular ) .",
    "one needs also the total averaged intensity @xmath8,\\ ] ] which is invariant with respect to the choice of @xmath6 .",
    "let us treat seriously the basic definitions of quantum mechanics .",
    "the state , @xmath9 , is describing a _ statistical ensemble _ of equivalently prepared systems . an average value of an observable is taken over such a statistical ensemble . in experiment",
    "this implies many repetitions ( runs ) .",
    "the average of the results of the runs gives the experimental average value of the observable .",
    "note , that not in every experiment we stick to such precise definitions .",
    "e.g. if one has high repetition pulsed source the measured intensities usually cover very many pulses .",
    "in such an effective coarse - grained approach , the traditional approach to stokes parameters may be the only way to proceed .",
    "however , if one defines the state of the mode by the quantum description for a single pulse , the situation changes . as in principle",
    "each pulse can be treated as a repetition of the experiment , and if the repetition rate is not too high , detection can be made for each pulse separately , and one can get proper quantum averages as in textbooks . in such a regime one can be tempted to define polarization as it should be : as a property of quantum light which is totally independent of its intensity .",
    "this it is our aim .",
    "we shall redefine stokes parameters in such a way that in each run the registered intensity of light will be irrelevant , that is , it would not decide on the weight of the given run in calculating the average polarization .",
    "thus , the average polarization will be an average of measured polarizations in the runs .",
    "_ in simple words _ , we assume the following measurement procedure .",
    "we have a sequence of light pluses , which are equivalently prepared .",
    "when @xmath10-th pulse arrives at the detection station , which consists of a two - output polarization analyzer and pair of detectors , one measures the total arriving intensity ( to be modeled here by the total number of detected photons by both detectors , denoted by @xmath11 ) , and the photon numbers at each output , respectively @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the measured value of the redefined stokes parameter @xmath6 is for the @xmath10-th run @xmath14 whenever @xmath15 , we put @xmath16 .",
    "this is averaged over the runs ( sequence of pulses ) , and gives the redefined stokes parameter @xmath6 , denoted here by @xmath17 .",
    "we also introduce @xmath18 as the frequency of runs in which @xmath19    yes , to measure the new stokes parameters would require specific registration techniques , especially in the case of higher repetition rates .",
    "still , there is are fundamental obstacles to such measurements .",
    "if the reader is still unconvinced that the suggested modification of the stokes parameters is of any value , then please consider the following .",
    "we have a highly developed theory of entanglement of systems described by finite dimensional hilbert spaces , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "still we are in search of entanglement conditions for infinite dimensional systems .",
    "as we shall see the new approach to stokes parameters allows us to re - formulate entanglement conditions , so that they , at least in the case of considered examples , allow to detect entanglement via polarization measurements for broader families of quantum optical states .",
    "thus the new approach may be useful in the lab .",
    "in the theory , it serves as a handy , and more sensitive tool to build better entanglement indicators .",
    "to the best of our knowledge the modified stokes parameters used here can not be found in the literature .",
    "e.g. , a recent extensive discussion of proposals for degree of polarization of quantum fields does not cover the ideas presented here @xcite .",
    "below , we shall use the number operator @xmath20 as our model for intensity observable .",
    "however , obvious generalizations of our formalism to other models @xcite exist .",
    "the redefined stokes parameters written up using the quantum optical formalism read : @xmath21.\\ ] ] we explain notation below , but first we address the most important features of the formula . note that the operator in the denominator , which represents the total number of photons , @xmath22 , is invariant with respect to the chosen polarization @xmath6 . in order to avoid problems with vacuum components ,",
    "which give zero in the denominator , the new stokes operator acts only in the non - vacuum sector of the fock space of photons : symbols @xmath23 stand for projectors @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the vacuum state of the two mode field satisfying @xmath26 we also introduce @xmath27 , $ ] which is the probability of a non - vacuum event .    note here that the new definition , although following a similar motivation , introduces operators of a completely different nature than the earlier _ pseudo - spin _",
    "ones @xcite .",
    "the pseudo - spin operators had as their spectrum just @xmath28 , while the redefined stokes operators introduced here have an infinite spectrum , which covers all _ rational _ numbers , contained in the set bounded by @xmath28 .",
    "for readers convenience we recall here that e.g. the @xmath29 component of pseudo - spin is @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the number of photons operator for the given single mode .",
    "note further , that while one missing photon completely flips the value of pseudo - spin , in the case of our stokes operators , for higher photon numbers , the value does not change much .",
    "one can easily notice that the numerator in the definitions can be put as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a pauli matrix , and @xmath34 is a row matrix @xmath35 $ ] , and @xmath3 its `` column hermitian conjugate '' involving the annihilation operators .",
    "_ any _ pauli operator is represented by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a unit real vector , and @xmath38 is a ` vector ' built out of three pauli matrices : @xmath39 .",
    "thus the redefined stokes operator for any elliptic polarization , associated with the vector @xmath37 , reads : @xmath40 obviously , for all @xmath37 , one has @xmath41 , and thus @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is a stokes vector built out of the three components @xmath44 . as the above inequality holds for _ any unit _",
    "@xmath37 , by choosing @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the norm of a vector , one proves that : @xmath47 because of this property one could alternatively call the new parameters _ polarization bloch vectors for quantum optical fields_. the expression @xmath48 gives a modified degree of polarization parameter .",
    "below e shall show that the new approach to stokes parameters allows a better detection of entanglement via polarization measurements .    as our example shall consider here the four mode ( bright ) squeezed vacuum state @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 refer to the two directions along which the photon pairs are emitted , @xmath52 denote horizontal / vertical polarization , and @xmath53 represents an amplification gain .",
    "the state represents essentially strongly driven type ii parametric down conversion process @xcite .",
    "an entanglement condition can be formulated by employing the intuition that for the two photon singlet , and also for four mode bright squeezed vacuum state ( a generalized singlet ) one has @xmath54 and that for _ no _ separable state this expression can be zero .",
    "this extended epr correlation is a reformulation of the one given in @xcite for standard stokes parameters .",
    "the epr condition can also be put in a more sophisticated form of @xmath55 which is a reformulation of the condition given in @xcite , but we shall not discuss this here .    with conditions for epr correlations like ( [ epr-1 ] ) , one can establish an entanglement criterion by finding the minimal value of the above expressions for separable states .",
    "one has @xmath56 recalling the well known formula for the usual stokes operators : @xmath57 one can easily find its equivalent for the new stokes operators @xmath58 thus we have the values of the first two terms of the rhs of ( [ epr-5 ] ) : @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the lowest possible value of @xmath61 is easy to estimate by noticing that , after the decomposition of a separable state to a probabilistic mixture of pure states , @xmath62 each endowed with it redefined stokes parameters @xmath63 and @xmath64 , where @xmath65 one gets    @xmath66    this is because the vectors in the expression can not have norms larger than @xmath67 , and the fact that @xmath68 , which in turn is less than @xmath69 .",
    "next we notice that @xmath70 , and finally that @xmath71 thus a _ necessary _ condition for a state to be separable reads : @xmath72    in the ref .",
    "@xcite one can find a ( necessary ) separability condition expressed in term of standard stokes operators : @xmath73    in supplementary information we show that the condition ( [ epr - sep ] ) , in the case of noise modeled by photon losses ( due to non - perfect efficiency of detection ) , detects the entanglement of @xmath74 better than ( [ old ] ) .",
    "we model this loss effect by placing a beamsplitter of transmitivity @xmath75 in front of each detector , and treat the reflecting channel as losses .",
    "no matter what is the gain parameter @xmath53 , the standard condition ( [ old ] ) fails to detect the entanglement in @xmath74 for @xmath76 , see @xcite , while the new condition still works for lower efficiencies than @xmath77 ( the actual threshold @xmath78 is a _ decreasing _ function of @xmath53 , which is less that @xmath77 for all @xmath79 ) .",
    "this has interesting ramifications .",
    "note that the new condition ( [ epr - sep ] ) allows the following . in theory , for prefect detection case , @xmath80 , one can beam - split both beams , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , in a polarization neutral way , by using three output polarization - neutral beamsplitters ( tritters ) , of the property that they split the incoming beams into three beams of equal ( average ) intensities .",
    "if we now place at the exits of the local beamsplitters three polarization measurement stations , set to measure simultaneously three complementary polarizations ( e.g. horizontal - vertical , diagonal - antidiagonal , left - right circular ) , the conditions ( [ old ] ) would not be capable to detect entanglement of @xmath74 .",
    "however , condition ( [ epr - sep ] ) would still detect entanglement , because the pairs of identical polarization measurements devices , one at side @xmath50 , the other at @xmath51 , would give correlations as if we had an experiment without the tritter , but with detection efficiency @xmath81 .",
    "thus the old condition obeys the standard ` complementarity rule of thumb ' , while the new one does not .",
    "of course the reason for circumventing the complementarity rule in the second case is that in the case of @xmath74 we do not have defined photon numbers , and the state has components of arbitrarily high photon numbers , @xmath82 .",
    "strict polarization complementarity rule works in the case of condition ( [ epr - sep ] ) only for one photon is beam @xmath50 and one photon in beam @xmath51 , that is for the singlet @xmath83 .",
    "the new approach allows one to map entanglement conditions for pairs of qubits , for a review see @xcite , into entanglement indicators for optical fields employing the new polarization parameters .",
    "the map can be constructed as follows .",
    "take an entanglement witness , or any other indicator of two qubit non - separability .",
    "expand it in terms of local pauli operators , and replace the pauli operators by the ones introduced here .",
    "namely @xmath84 and @xmath85    to illustrate this , let us take the condition for separability of two - qubit states derived in @xcite .",
    "we choose this example because of its generality .",
    "the condition of ref .",
    "@xcite was shown therein to be equivalent to the partial transposition condition ( ppt , which is a sufficient and necessary separability condition for two qubit states ) .",
    "it reads @xmath86 the derivative separability condition for polarization parameters reads : @xmath87 as it can not be for sure a necessary _ and sufficient _",
    "condition for separability of the quantum optical states , we shall now give only the proof of its necessity ( that is , that a violation of this condition indicates entanglement ) .    to this end",
    "we shall use the fact that inequality ( [ pan1 ] ) holds ( also ) for any product mixed state of two qubits .",
    "thus the bloch vectors of the two qubits , @xmath88 and @xmath89 must satisfy :    @xmath90    this can be linearized by noticing that the above implies that for any @xmath91 @xmath92 next notice , that the above inequality holds also for bloch vector for products of mixed states of the two qubits .",
    "thus one can have @xmath93 .",
    "this if one introduce two numbers @xmath94 , and @xmath95 , such that @xmath96 , then the following inequality also holds : @xmath97    this simple inequality can be used for the components of vectors @xmath98 , and parameters @xmath99 used earlier , which are values of the averages of stokes parameters ( of the redefined form introduced here ) for product states of light in beams @xmath50 and @xmath51 , which enter the convex expansion of a given separable state .",
    "we have @xmath100 where the common symbol @xmath101 was dropped . after averaging over and probability @xmath102 , and using the cauchy inequality for the terms with trigonometric functions",
    "one gets ( [ pan2b ] ) .    with such general lines of reasoning one",
    "can derive necessary conditions for separability based on any other two - qubit entanglement criterion .",
    "note , that such conditions have their equivalents in the traditional approach to stokes parameters .",
    "in such a case product states @xmath103 are endowed with stokes vectors of arbitrary lengths .",
    "let us denote their components by by @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "it is obvious that the following algebraic identity holds ( @xmath106 s are again dropped ) : @xmath107 for any @xmath103 , one has @xmath108\\geq ||\\vec{z}^k(\\lambda)||$ ] .",
    "thus in inequality ( [ pan7 ] ) , one can be safely replace @xmath109 by @xmath110 , just as it was done in ( [ pan5 ] ) . upon convex summation over the probability of the given pair of product states in the separable state ,",
    "one reaches the following separability condition with traditional stokes parameters    @xmath111    the graphs in fig . 1",
    "show the strength of violation of the separability conditions ( [ pan8 ] ) and ( [ pan2b ] ) by the bright squeezed vacuum .",
    "modified stokes parameters outperform the traditional ones for all finite @xmath53 .",
    "this , of course , signals a better noise tolerance by the condition ( [ pan2b ] ) .",
    "comparison of entanglement criteria for the bsv state in a function of amplification gain @xmath53 .",
    "the criteria are based on different definitions of the stokes parameters : traditional ( [ pan8 ] ) , redefined ( [ pan2b ] ) .",
    "@xmath112 stands for the value of the left hand sides . above level @xmath113",
    "we detect entanglement.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "the redefined approach to polarization of quantum states of light , with undefined total photon number , allows us to see violations of separability , in experiments using only polarization measurements , in situations in case of which more traditional approaches fail to detect entanglement .",
    "of course , as average values of polarization observables do not define the state ( state reconstruction with such averages is possible only in the case of a single pair of photons , one photon in beam @xmath50 the other in @xmath51 ) we are able only to construct sufficient conditions for entanglement .",
    "the intuitive reason for this is that , the traditional approach is more  coarse grained \" .",
    "the average total intensity is used to  normalize \" the stokes parameters , while in our approach , we have a re - normalized polarization measurement in each run .",
    "the averages which we use are averages of  polarization events \"  totally independent of the measured ( fluctuating ) intensity .",
    "note further , that photon s polarization is an observable which is independent of its momentum and energy , thus our re - normalization is in tune with this intuitive aspect .",
    "currently in the case of pulsed sources , if the repetition rate is not too high , run - by - run measurements of total intensity and polarization parameters are possible and in fact performed in the labs @xcite .",
    "thus the approach of ours is not pure theory , it can be applied in analysis of data collected in experiments .",
    "however , from the point of view of pure theory it shows that one can detect entanglement of optical fields , using only polarization measurements , for a significantly broader families of states , than in the case of the traditional approach . in a separate work @xcite",
    "we show that the method can be tailored in such a way so that one can construct bell inequalities , based only on the assumptions of realism , locality and ` freedom ' , that is without invoking other ` reasonable ' assumptions , as it is usually done for optical fields .",
    "such ( fully ) device independent entanglement conditions are , surprisingly , violated by a wider class of states than standard bell inequalities @xcite involving intensities ( and requiring additional assumptions ) .",
    "it did not escape or attention that the approach can be extended to multi - party situations , and to description of other quantum optical phenomena than polarizations .",
