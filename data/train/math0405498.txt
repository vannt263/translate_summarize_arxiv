    "according to birman @xcite , markov @xcite originally stated his braid equivalence theorem using _ three _ braid moves ; later there was another brief announcement of an improved version of markov s theorem by weinberg @xcite consisting of the _ two _ well - known braid - equivalence moves : conjugation in the braid groups and the ` stabilizing ' or ` markov ' moves ( @xmath1moves ) .",
    "our first main result is a _ one - move _ markov theorem which we now state .",
    "an _ @xmath2move _ on a braid consists of cutting one arc of the braid open and splicing into the broken strand new strands to the top and bottom , both either _ under _ or _ over _ the rest of the braid :    @xmath3    @xmath2moves and isotopy generate an equivalence relation on braids called _ @xmath2equivalence_. in  4 we prove that @xmath2equivalence classes of braids are in bijective correspondence with isotopy classes of oriented links in @xmath0 , where the bijection is induced by ` closing ' the braid to form a link . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath2equivalence is the same as the usual markov equivalence and thus the classical markov theorem is sharpened .",
    "the proofs are based on a canonical process for turning a combinatorial oriented link diagram in the plane ( with a little extra structure ) into an open braid .",
    "our braiding as well as the @xmath2moves are based on the building blocks of combinatorial isotopy , the _ triangle moves _ or _",
    "@xmath4moves_. this makes the proof conceptually very simple .",
    "our braiding operation is essentially the same as the operation using a ` saw - tooth ' given by j. birman in @xcite .",
    "we use the point at infinity as the reference point for braiding and so a saw - tooth becomes a pair of vertical lines that meet at infinity .",
    "the change of reference point to infinity makes the proof of markov theorem easier because there are very few ways that saw - teeth can obstruct each other .",
    "moreover , the local nature of our proof allows us to formulate and prove first the relative version of markov theorem , another new result stating that , if two isotopic links contain the same braided portion then any two corresponding braids which both contain that braided portion differ by a sequence of @xmath2moves that do not affect the braided portion .",
    "we then prove a second relative version of the theorem for links which contain a common closed braid and deduce an analogue of markov theorem for knot isotopy in complements of knots / links , which we finally extend to an analogue of markov theorem for links in arbitrary closed 3manifolds .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath1 be a closed connected orientable 3manifold .",
    "we can assume that @xmath1 is given by surgery on the closure of a braid @xmath5 in @xmath0 , thus @xmath1 is represented by @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , any oriented link in @xmath1 can be represented as the closure of a further braid @xmath6 such that @xmath7 is also a braid and we shall call it _ mixed braid_. then the mixed braid equivalence in @xmath0 that reflects isotopy in @xmath1 is generated firstly by @xmath2moves , as above , but performed only on strings of @xmath6 and secondly by _ braid band moves _ or _ b.b .",
    "moves_. these are moves that reflect the sliding of a part of a link across the 2disc bounded by the specified longitude of a surgery component of the closure of @xmath5 .",
    "i.e. suppose a string of @xmath6 is adjacent to one of @xmath5 , then a slide of the first over the second ( with a half - twisted band ) replaces @xmath6 by a braid with one or more extra strings parallel to the strings of @xmath5 which form the appropriate component in the closure :    @xmath8    most results are based on material in @xcite worked at warwick university under the advice of the second author . however , they are sharpened versions and some parts of the proofs are improved considerably .",
    "* acknowledgements *   the second author would like to acknowledge a conversation with dale rolfsen which was crucial in formulating the one - move markov theorem .",
    "the first author wishes to acknowledge discussions with jozef przytycki , cameron gordon and david yetter on the set  up and some technical details , in warsaw 95 , and also to thank the e.u . for financial support and the sfb 170 in gttingen for hospitality and financial support",
    "a knot is a special case of a link , so from now on we shall be referring to both knots and links as ` links ' . throughout the first part of this paper we shall be working in a combinatorial setting . in particular",
    ", we consider oriented _ links / geometric braids _ in 3space each of the components / strands of which is made of a finite number of straight arcs endowed with matching orientation ; also their _ diagrams _ , that is , regular projections on the plane ( with only finitely many crossings ) , where in addition no vertex of the link / braid should be mapped onto a double point . a _",
    "geometric braid diagram _ or simply a _ braid _ has a top - to - bottom direction and , in addition , we require that no two crossings are on the same horizontal level .",
    "if we slice up in general position ( i.e. without cutting through crossings ) a braid diagram on @xmath9 strands , it may be seen as a word on the ( well - known ) basic crossings  @xmath10  and @xmath11  for  @xmath12 ( we refer the reader to figure 9 for an example ) .",
    "the set of braids on @xmath9 strands modulo isotopy gives rise to the braid group @xmath13 with presentation : @xmath14 the operation in the group is _ concatenation _ ( we place one braid on top of the other ) , and the identity element is the braid on @xmath9 strands that does no braiding .",
    "note that the elements of @xmath13 are also called ` braids ' , but in here there will be no ambiguity , since we shall be working with geometric braid diagrams .",
    "there are two combinatorial moves on diagrams which we shall consider .",
    "* * @xmath4move : * an arc is replaced by two arcs forming a triangle ( and its inverse ) , respecting orientation and crossings . `",
    "respecting crossings ' means that , if we lift the diagram to an embedding in 3space , then the @xmath4move lifts to an elementary isotopy ( see figure 3 for examples ) . * * subdivision : * a vertex is introduced / deleted in an arc of the diagram .",
    "subdivision moves may be viewed as special cases of @xmath4moves .",
    "we shall call the equivalence relation generated by these two moves a _ combinatorial isotopy _ or just an _ isotopy_. it is a classical result of combinatorial topology that this notion of isotopy is equivalent to the standard definition of combinatorial ( or pl ) isotopy of the embedding obtained by lifting to 3space , and this in turn is equivalent to the notion of isotopy in the smooth category",
    ". moreover , reidemeister @xcite ( and alexander , briggs @xcite ) proved that a @xmath4move can break into a finite sequence of planar @xmath4moves and the three local @xmath4moves illustrated below ( known as ` reidemeister moves ' ) with their obvious symmetries ( for a detailed account see @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath15    let @xmath16 be a link diagram / braid and @xmath17 a point of an arc of @xmath16 such that @xmath17 is not vertically aligned with any of the crossings or ( other ) vertices of @xmath16 ( note that @xmath17 itself may be a vertex ) .",
    "then we can perform the following operation : cut the arc at @xmath17 , bend the two resulting smaller arcs apart slightly by a small isotopy and introduce two new vertical arcs to new top and bottom end - points in the same vertical line as @xmath17 .",
    "the new arcs are both oriented downwards and they run either both _ under _ or both _ over _ all other arcs of the diagram .",
    "thus there are two types of @xmath2moves , an _ under @xmath2move _ or _",
    "@xmath18move _ and an _ over @xmath2move _ or _",
    "@xmath19move_. ( recall figure 1 above for an example of the two braid @xmath2moves . )    below we illustrate @xmath19moves applied to an edge @xmath20 of an oriented link diagram such that @xmath20 moves via isotopy from a downward arc to an upward arc through the horizontal position .",
    "the thick circle will represent ` the rest of the diagram ' , while the region inside the circle shall be called ` the magnified region ' . note that , if we join freely ( using the dotted arcs ) the two new arcs we obtain a link diagram isotopic to the one on which the @xmath2move was applied .    @xmath21    definition 2.1 could be given even more generally so as to accommodate the possibility of the new vertical strands running _ upwards _",
    "( figure 4b ) .",
    "although , for the purposes of this paper we shall only consider @xmath2moves with the new vertical arcs oriented _",
    "downwards_.    using a small braid isotopy , a braid @xmath2move can be equivalently seen with a crossing ( positive or negative ) formed :    @xmath22    this gives the following algebraic expression for an @xmath19move and an @xmath18move respectively .",
    "@xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 are elements of @xmath13 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 are obtained from @xmath25 , @xmath26 by replacing each @xmath29 by @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath2moves and isotopy generate an equivalence relation in the set of braids , which we shall call _ @xmath2equivalence_. let now @xmath5 be a braid .",
    "the _ closure _ of @xmath5 is the oriented link diagram @xmath32 obtained by joining each top end - point to the corresponding bottom end - point by almost vertical arcs as illustrated in figure 6 , where @xmath5 is contained in a ` box ' .",
    "( note that we draw some smooth arcs for convenience . )",
    "@xmath33    our aim is to prove the following theorem .",
    "@xmath34 induces a bijection between the set of @xmath2equivalence classes of braids and the set of isotopy types of ( oriented ) link diagrams .",
    "we shall define an inverse bijection to @xmath34 by means of a canonical _ braiding process _ which turns an oriented link diagram ( with a little extra structure ) into a braid .",
    "note that we only work with oriented diagrams , so in the sequel we shall drop the adjective .",
    "let @xmath16 be a link diagram with no horizontal arcs , and consider the arcs in @xmath16 which slope upwards with respect to their orientations ; call these arcs _",
    "opposite arcs_. in order to obtain a braid from that diagram we want : 1 ) to keep the arcs that go downwards .",
    "\\2 ) to eliminate the opposite arcs and produce instead braid strands .",
    "if we run along an opposite arc we are likely to meet a succession of overcrossings and undercrossings .",
    "we subdivide ( marking with points ) every opposite arc into smaller  if necessary ",
    "pieces , each containing crossings of only _",
    "one _ type ; i.e. we may have :    @xmath35    we call the resulting pieces _ up  arcs _ , and we label every up  arc with an _ ` o'/`u ' _ according as it is the _ over / under _ arc of a crossing ( or some crossings ) .",
    "if it is a _",
    "free up  arc _ (",
    "and therefore it contains no crossings ) , then we have a choice whether to label it _ ` o ' _ or _ `",
    "u'_. the idea is to eliminate the opposite arcs by eliminating their up ",
    "arcs one by one and create braid strands instead .",
    "let now @xmath36 be the top vertices of the up ",
    "arcs ; fix attention on one particular top vertex @xmath37 and suppose that @xmath17 is the top vertex of the up ",
    "arc @xmath38 . associated to @xmath38 is the _ sliding triangle _",
    "@xmath39 , which is a special case of a triangle needed for a @xmath4move ; it is right - angled with hypotenuse @xmath38 and with the right angle lying below the up  arc .",
    "note that , if @xmath38 is itself vertical , then @xmath39 degenerates into the arc @xmath38 .",
    "we say that a sliding triangle is of type _ over _ or _ under _ according to the label of the up  arc it is associated with .",
    "( this implies that there may be triangles of the same type lying one on top of the other . )",
    "the germ of our braiding process is this .",
    "suppose for definiteness that @xmath38 is of type _",
    "over_. then perform an @xmath19move at @xmath17 followed by a @xmath4move across the sliding triangle @xmath39 ( see figure 8) . by general position",
    "the resulting diagram will be regular and @xmath40 may be assumed to slope slightly downwards .",
    "if @xmath38 were _ under _ then the @xmath19move would be replaced by an @xmath18move .",
    "note that the effect of these two moves has been to replace the up ",
    "arc @xmath38 by three arcs none of which are up  arcs , and therefore we now have fewer up  arcs . if we repeat this process for each up  arc in turn , then the result will be a braid .",
    "@xmath41    in the following example we illustrate the braiding process applied to a particular link diagram ( we do not draw the sliding triangles ) .",
    "the numbering of the strands indicates the order in which we eliminated the up  arcs . obviously , for different orders we may obtain different braids .",
    "@xmath42    it is clear from the above that different choices when doing the braiding ( e.g. when choosing labels for the free up  arcs or when choosing an order for layering sliding triangles of the same type ) as well as slight isotopy changes on the diagram level may result in important changes in the braid picture . for the proof of theorem 2.3 we would like to control such changes as much as possible",
    "for this we shall need a more rigorous setting .",
    "sliding triangles are said to be _ adjacent _ if the corresponding up ",
    "arcs have a common vertex ( then the sliding triangles will have a common corner ) .",
    "* triangle condition * _ non - adjacent sliding triangles are only allowed to meet if they are of opposite types ( i.e. one over and the other under ) . _",
    "@xmath43    given a link diagram @xmath16 , there is a subdivision @xmath44 of @xmath16 such that ( for appropriate choices of under / over for free up ",
    "arcs ) the triangle condition is satisfied .    let @xmath45 minimum distance between any two crossings of @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath46 be such that any circle of radius @xmath47 centred at a crossing point does not intersect with any other arc of the diagram .",
    "let @xmath48 be the minimum distance between any two points in @xmath16 further than @xmath47 away from any crossing point .",
    "now let @xmath49min\\{@xmath48,@xmath47 } and @xmath44 be a subdivision of the diagram such that the length of every up ",
    "arc is less than @xmath50 .",
    "then the triangle condition is satisfied , provided we make the right choices ( under / over ) for sliding triangles of free up ",
    "arcs near crossings ( see picture above ) .",
    "\\(1 ) the triangle condition implies that the eliminating moves do not interfere with each other , so there are no pairs of sliding triangles that need layering and therefore it does not matter in what order we eliminate the up  arcs .",
    "in fact we can eliminate all of them _ simultaneously_. ( 2 )",
    "the choice of @xmath50 in the last proof is far smaller than necessary .",
    "in fact we only need to consider the subdiagram consisting of up  arcs and crossings on up  arcs .",
    "( 3 ) notice that the choice of under / over for some of the free up ",
    "arcs may be forced by the labelling of other up  arcs ( see for example the top _ over _ up  arc in figure 10 ) .",
    "we can  if we wish  further subdivide the diagram ( here the under up  arc ) to make such pairs disjoint .",
    "( 4 ) if a diagram satisfies the triangle condition , then so does any subdivision ( where the smaller triangles may need to retain the same labels ) .    a _ generic diagram _ is a link diagram with subdividing points and sliding triangles put in general position with respect to the height function , such that the following conditions hold : 1 )",
    "there are no horizontal arcs ,    \\2 )  no two disjoint subdividing points are in vertical alignment , where by ` disjoint ' we mean subdividing points that do not share a common edge .",
    "\\3 )  any two non - adjacent sliding triangles satisfy the triangle condition and if they intersect , this should be along a common interior ( and not a single point ) .    conditions 1 and 3 are related to the braiding , whilst condition 2 ensures that no pair of strands in the resulting braid will be in the same vertical line .",
    "generic @xmath4move _ is a @xmath4move between generic diagrams .    in the sequel , by ` @xmath4moves '",
    "we shall always refer to the local planar @xmath4moves together with the reidemeister moves .",
    "an isotopy between generic link diagrams can be realized using only generic @xmath4moves .",
    "if after some @xmath4move during the isotopy appears a horizontal arc or vertical alignment of vertices we remove it by replacing one of the participating vertices by a point arbitrarily close to it , so that the new point will not cause such a singularity or violation of condition 3 in _ all _ the diagrams of the isotopy chain .",
    "this is possible by a general position argument .",
    "if two non - adjacent sliding triangles touch so that condition 3 is violated ( figure 11a ) we argue as above . also , by definition of regular isotopy , two non - adjacent triangles can not touch on two subdividing points or on a point with a hypotenuse or along their hypotenuses .",
    "therefore , the remaining possibilities are the ones illustrated in figure 11b .",
    "@xmath51    as before , by general position we can replace one of the participating vertices by a point arbitrarily close to it , so that the new point will not violate conditions 1 , 2 and 3 in all the diagrams of the isotopy chain .",
    "finally , if two triangles happen to intersect after a @xmath4move and they are of opposite type , then the move is generic .",
    "if they are of the same type and the intersection is not essential ( see figure 12 ) we simply subdivide further and we carry the subdivision through in the whole chain of the isotopic diagrams , taking care that the subdividing point will not violate condition 2 in the whole chain .",
    "( note that , by remark 3.2 ( 4 ) , condition 3 will not be violated . )",
    "@xmath52    if the intersection is essential ( for example in figure 13 a free up  arc labelled ` u ' moves by a @xmath4move over another arc ) , then we introduce an appropriate extra subdividing point so as to create a smaller free up  arc",
    "to which we attach the opposite label .",
    "this is always possible by lemma 3.1 .",
    "@xmath53    it is clear from lemma 3.5 that generic link diagrams are dense in the space of all diagrams ; indeed , a non - generic link diagram may be seen as a middle stage of the isotopy between generic diagrams .",
    "thus w.l.o.g .",
    "we shall assume from now on that all diagrams are generic ; also , by virtue of lemma 3.5 that all isotopy moves are also generic .",
    "we are now ready to give a rigorous braiding process .",
    "namely , take a link diagram and eliminate one by one the up  arcs in the way described above . by remark 3.2",
    "( 1 ) the order of the eliminating moves is now irrelevant .    any ( oriented ) link diagram is isotopic to the closure of a braid .",
    "the braiding process comprises @xmath2moves and then isotopies .",
    "but the effect of an @xmath2move after closure is by definition an isotopy .",
    "by the local nature of the @xmath4moves we may assume that for a given link diagram we have done the braiding for all up ",
    "arcs except for the ones that we are interested in every time ; these will be lying in the magnified region placed inside the braid . by remark 3.2 ( 1 ) this choice does not affect the final braid .",
    "now , two braids that differ by a finite sequence of @xmath2moves have isotopic closures .",
    "therefore the function @xmath34 from @xmath2equivalence classes of braids to isotopy types of link diagrams is well - defined . to show that @xmath34 is a bijection we shall use our braiding process to define an inverse function @xmath54 .",
    "namely , for a diagram @xmath16 let @xmath55 be the braid resulting from the braiding algorithm applied to it .",
    "we have to show that @xmath54 is a well - defined function from link - diagram types to @xmath2equivalence classes of braids , therefore we have to check that @xmath55 does not depend up to @xmath2equivalence on the choices made before the braiding and on @xmath4moves between link diagrams .",
    "the choices made before the braiding consist of the subdividing points we choose and the labelling we may have to choose for some free up ",
    "finally , we have to show that @xmath34 and @xmath54 are mutually inverse .",
    "this is easy : closing the result of the braiding process yields a link isotopic to the original one , therefore @xmath56 .",
    "moreover , applying the braiding process to the closure of a braid yields precisely the same braid back again ( from the way we defined closure ) , so @xmath57 .",
    "the proof relies entirely on remark 3.2 ( 1 ) and on the following two lemmas .",
    "if we add on an up  arc , @xmath58 , an extra subdividing point @xmath17 and label the two new up  arcs , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , the same as @xmath58 , the corresponding braids are @xmath2equivalent .",
    "for definiteness we assume that @xmath58 is labelled with an ` o ' .",
    "we complete the braiding of the original diagram by eliminating @xmath58 ( see picture below ) .",
    "then , on the new horizontal piece of string , we take an arbitrarily small neighbourhood @xmath59 around @xmath60 , the projection of @xmath17 ( see picture below ) . by general position @xmath59 slopes slightly downwards .",
    "we then perform an _ over _ l - move at @xmath60 . finally ,",
    "sliding an appropriate piece of string using braid planar isotopy , we obtain the braid that would result from the original diagram with the subdividing point @xmath17 included ( see figure 14 ) .",
    "( note that new vertical strands coming from the braiding that may run over or under @xmath58 do not affect the result . )",
    "@xmath61    when we meet a free up  arc , which we have the choice of labelling ` u ' or ` o ' , the resulting braid does not depend  up to @xmath2equivalence  on this choice .",
    "first , we shall assume for simplicity that the sliding triangle of the up  arc does not lie over or under any other arcs of the original diagram .",
    "also we assume for definiteness that the up",
    " arc is originally labelled ` o ' .",
    "we complete the braiding by eliminating it .",
    "then on the new almost - horizontal piece of string we take an arbitrarily small neighbourhood @xmath59 of a point @xmath60 that is a projection of an arbitrarily small neighbourhood @xmath62 on the original up  arc , and such that there is no other vertical line between the vertical line of @xmath17 and the one of @xmath60 ( figure 15 ) .",
    "we then perform an @xmath18move at @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath63    the fact that the original up  arc is free and small enough implies that only vertical strands can pass over or under its sliding triangle . therefore ",
    "as @xmath62 is arbitrarily small  there is no arc crossing @xmath64 so as to force it be an _ under _ arc .",
    "also , by braid planar isotopy we shift @xmath65 slightly _ higher _ , so as to come to the position where we can undo an @xmath19move ( see figure 16 ) .",
    "we undo it , so the final braid  up to a small braid planar isotopy  can be seen as the braid that we would have obtained from the original diagram with the free up ",
    "arc labelled with ` u ' instead of ` o ' .",
    "@xmath66    notice that , if the original up  arc were an ` u ' we would perform an @xmath19move at @xmath60 . to complete the proof of the lemma",
    "we assume that the sliding triangle of our up ",
    "arc lies over or under other arcs of the original diagram . in this case",
    "we subdivide it ( using lemma 4.1 ) into arcs small enough to ensure that all the sliding triangles are clear ; we give all new arcs the labelling of the original one .",
    "then we change the labelling of each up  arc using the above and , using lemma 4.1 again , we eliminate all the new subdividing points ( figure 17 ) .    @xmath67     if we have a chain of overlapping sliding triangles of free up ",
    "arcs so that we have a free choice of labelling for the whole chain then , by lemmas 4.1 and 4.2 , this choice does not affect  up to @xmath2equivalence  the final braid .",
    "if by adding a subdividing point on an up  arc we have a choice for relabelling the resulting new up  arcs so that the triangle condition is still satisfied then , by lemmas 4.1 and 4.2 , the resulting braids are @xmath2equivalent .",
    "given any two subdivisions , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , of a diagram which will satisfy the triangle condition with appropriate labellings , the resulting braids are @xmath2equivalent .    by remark 3.2",
    "( 4 ) this can be easily seen if we consider the subdivision @xmath70 and apply the lemmas above .",
    "corollary 4.5 proves independence of subdivision and labelling for diagrams , and thus we are done with the static part of the proof . using corollary 4.5",
    "we have also proved independence of @xmath4moves related to condition 3 of definition 3.3 ( recall proof of lemma 3.5 ) .",
    "it remains to consider the effect of the rest of the @xmath4moves .",
    "we shall check first the planar @xmath4moves .",
    "these will include the examination of @xmath4moves related to conditions 1 and 2 of definition 3.3 .",
    "now , a @xmath4move can be regarded as a continuous family of diagrams ( see figure 18 ) . from the above we",
    "shall assume that the triangle condition is not violated .",
    "also , by symmetry , we only have to check the @xmath4moves that take place in the first quarter of the plane , above the edge @xmath64 , and w.l.o.g .",
    "@xmath64 is an up  arc .",
    "therefore , the @xmath4moves we want to check can split into moves that take place above @xmath64 within the vertical zone defined by @xmath65 and @xmath5 and moves that take place outside this zone .",
    "all resulting braids will be compared with the braid obtained by subdividing @xmath64 at an appropriate point @xmath17 .",
    "i.e. we have :    _ ( i ) inside subdivision _   consider the continuous family of triangles with edge @xmath64 and all the new vertices lying on the vertical line of an interior point @xmath17 of @xmath64 ( figure 18 ) .",
    "a new vertex can not aligne horizontally with @xmath5 .",
    "so , if @xmath71 is a new edge before the horizontal position from below , we can see @xmath2equivalence of the corresponding braids by introducing an extra vertex in @xmath64 at @xmath17 and applying lemma 4.1 ( see left - hand side of figure 19 ) .",
    "@xmath72    if @xmath73 has passed above the horizontal position and therefore it becomes a down  arc ( cf .",
    "definition 3.3 , condition 1 ) , we introduce an @xmath2move at the point @xmath5 and we show that again we obtain the same braid as if we had originally subdivided @xmath64 at @xmath17 ( see right - hand side of figure 19 ) .",
    "the type of the @xmath2move is over / under according as @xmath64 is an over / under up  arc .",
    "@xmath74    note that , if @xmath64 were originally a down  arc , then the new edges would pass from down  arcs to opposite arcs through the horizontal position . in this case",
    ", according to the way we do the braiding and to the triangle condition , we may need to subdivide further the new opposite arcs and apply lemmas 4.1 and 4.2 . before continuing with the proof",
    "we introduce some extra notation .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath75 the braid obtained by completing the braiding on the arcs @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "suppose now we subdivide @xmath64 at a different point , @xmath78 say .",
    "then , by lemma 4.1 we have @xmath79 , since they both differ by an @xmath2move from @xmath80 . in figure 20",

    "we only need to examine the @xmath4moves taking place on the side of @xmath5 , say .",
    "assume first that @xmath17 is close enough to @xmath5 so that no braid strand passes in between the vertical lines of @xmath17 and @xmath5 .",

    "reasoning as above , if @xmath60 is a new vertex such that @xmath71 is below the horizontal position , then @xmath83 differs from @xmath75 by an @xmath2move introduced at @xmath5 .",
    "also , if @xmath84 is a new vertex such that @xmath85 is below the horizontal , then @xmath86 differs from @xmath83 by an @xmath2move introduced on @xmath87 at the point @xmath84 .",
    "@xmath88    assume now that the @xmath4move introduces a new vertex @xmath78 so that between the vertical lines of @xmath17 and @xmath78 there is a braid strand ( cf .",
    "definition 3.3 , condition 2 ) . in this case",
    "we see the @xmath2equivalence by introducing and deleting two @xmath19moves ( figure 22 ) .    @xmath89    we shall now check the reidemeister moves ( recall figure 3 ) . to check the first two moves we follow similar reasoning as above , but we shall demonstrate it here for completeness .",
    "for the first one , we illustrate below that the braid obtained after the performance of the move is equivalent to the one obtained before the move , up to braid isotopy and one @xmath19move :    @xmath90    for the second move we complete the braiding of the left - hand side diagram and we notice that , using braid isotopy , we can undo an @xmath18move .",
    "we then obtain the braid that we would obtain from the right - hand side diagram with label ` u ' for the up  arc .",
    "@xmath91    we shall now check the third type of reidemeister moves or ` triple point moves ' . if all three arcs are down  arcs then the move is a braid isotopy .",
    "if either of the outer arcs is an up  arc then the move is invisible in the braid .",
    "it remains to check the case where both outer arcs are down  arcs and the middle arc is an up  arc .",
    "but then the following trick changes the situation to the one where all three arcs are down  arcs .",
    "@xmath92    we have now proved that the function @xmath54 from isotopy types of link diagrams to @xmath2equivalence classes of braids is well - defined , and the proof of theorem 2.3 is now completed .",
    "@xmath93      the classical markov braid theorem states that :    _ isotopy classes of ( oriented ) link diagrams are in 1 - 1 correspondence with certain equivalence classes in the set of all braids , the equivalence being given by the following two algebraically formulated moves between braids in @xmath94 : _    * _ conjugation : _ if  @xmath95  then  @xmath96 . * _ markov moves or @xmath1moves : _ if   @xmath97  then  @xmath98  and  @xmath99 .",
    "it is clear from remark 2.2 that an @xmath1move is a special case of an @xmath2move .",
    "also , it follows from the proof of theorem 2.3 that conjugation can be realized by a ( finite ) sequence of @xmath2moves .",
    "indeed , let @xmath58 and @xmath100 be two conjugate braids .",
    "then their closures @xmath101 and @xmath102 are isotopic diagrams and so they differ by a sequence of @xmath9 , say , @xmath4moves ; so , for each stage of isotopy we obtain the following sequence of link diagrams @xmath103 which we turn into the braids @xmath104 , say , using our algorithm . from the above ,",
    "every consecutive pair of these braids differs by a finite sequence of @xmath2moves .",
    "now , the way we defined the closure of a braid ( recall figure 6 ) guarantees that @xmath105 is @xmath100 and @xmath13 is @xmath58 .",
    "thus , conjugation is only a redundant ` auxilliary ' move used to bring the @xmath1moves inside the braid box , and therefore theorem 2.3 indeed sharpens the classical result .    as a concrete example",
    ", we illustrate below the main instances of the isotopy sequence from the closure of a braid that is conjugate to @xmath58 by an elementary crossing , up to @xmath101 .",
    "@xmath106    \\(1 ) the proof of theorem 2.3 may be clearly used as an alternative proof of the classical theorem .",
    "indeed , whenever in the proof appears an @xmath2move we use conjugation to bring it to the position of an @xmath1move .",
    "the same reasoning holds for all markov - type theorems that follow in the sequel .",
    "( 2 ) it should be stressed that theorem 2.3 sharpens the classical result only if we work with open braids .",
    "if we work with closed braids we do not need conjugation in the braid equivalence .",
    "we should also stress that vertical alignment of top vertices is the most important case to check in the proof of theorem 2.3 because it corresponds precisely to conjugation by a generator @xmath10 in @xmath13 .      as a consequence of the proof of theorem 2.3 we can prove a relative version of the result . by a _ braided portion _ of a link diagram we mean a finite number of arcs in the link which are all oriented downwards ( so that the braid resulting from our braiding process will contain this braided portion ) .",
    "let @xmath107 , @xmath108 be oriented link diagrams which both contain a common braided portion @xmath5 .",
    "suppose that there is an isotopy of @xmath107 to @xmath108 which finishes with a homeomorphism fixed on @xmath5 .",
    "suppose further that @xmath109 and @xmath110 are braids obtained from our braiding process applied to @xmath107 and @xmath108 respectively .",
    "then @xmath109 and @xmath110 are @xmath2equivalent by moves that do not affect the common braided portion @xmath5 .",
    "assume first that the isotopy from @xmath107 to @xmath108 keeps @xmath5 fixed ; the result then follows immediately from the proof of theorem 2.3 because the braided portion does not participate in the proof .",
    "we shall use some standard pl topology to reduce the general case to this special case .",
    "let @xmath62 denote a relative regular neighbourhood of @xmath5 relative to the ends of the arcs ( i.e. @xmath62 comprises a number @xmath111 say of 3balls each of which contains an arc of @xmath5 as an unknotted subarc ) .",
    "think momentarily of these balls as small balls centred at points @xmath112 .",
    "the isotopy restricted to @xmath113 determines a loop in the configuration space of @xmath111 points in @xmath114 . but",
    "this configuration space is well - known to be simply - connected and therefore we may assume that the isotopy is fixed on @xmath113 . by the regular neighbourhood theorem we may now assume that the isotopy fixes @xmath62 setwise .",
    "now restrict attention to one of the balls .",
    "the isotopy on this ball determines a loop in the space of the pl homeomorphisms of the 3ball . but",
    "@xmath115 of this space is generated by a rotation through @xmath116 about some axis .",
    "we may suppose that this axis is the corresponding unknotted arc of @xmath5 and hence that the isotopy fixes this subarc pointwise .",
    "thus we may assume that the whole of @xmath5 is fixed pointwise .",
    "the result now follows from the special case .",
    "in this section we use the methods of theorem 2.3 to prove a second relative version ( relative to a fixed closed subbraid ) and deduce an analogue of markov s theorem for isotopy of oriented links in knot / link complements in @xmath0 .",
    "this is then used for extending the results to closed connected orientable 3manifolds .",
    "let @xmath117 be the complement of the oriented knot @xmath118 in @xmath0 .",
    "by ` knot complement ' we refer to complements of both knots and links .",
    "using alexander s theorem and the definition of ambient isotopy , @xmath117 is homeomorphic to @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is isotopic to @xmath118 and it is the closure of some braid @xmath5 .",
    "let now @xmath2 be an oriented link in @xmath1 .",
    "if we fix @xmath120 pointwise on its projection plane we may represent @xmath2 unambiguously by the _",
    "mixed link _ @xmath121 in @xmath0 , that is , a link in @xmath0 consisting of the _ fixed part _",
    "@xmath120 and the _ standard part _",
    "@xmath2 that links with @xmath120 ( for an example see figure 27a ) .",
    "let now @xmath107 , @xmath108 be two oriented links in @xmath1 .",
    "it follows from standard results of pl topology that @xmath107 and @xmath108 are isotopic in @xmath1 if and only if the mixed links @xmath124 and @xmath125 are isotopic in @xmath0 by an ambient isotopy which keeps @xmath120 pointwise fixed .",
    "see for example @xcite ; chapter 4 . in terms of mixed diagrams",
    "this isotopy will involve the fixed part of the mixed links only in the moves illustrated in figure 27b .",
    "these shall be called ` extended reidemeister moves ' .",
    "therefore reidemeister s theorem generalizes as follows in terms of mixed link diagrams .    two ( oriented ) links in @xmath1 are isotopic if and only if any two corresponding mixed link diagrams ( in @xmath0 ) differ by a finite sequence of the extented reidemeister moves together with the planar @xmath4moves and the reidemeister moves for the standard parts of the mixed links .",
    "we now wish to find an analogue of markov s theorem for links in @xmath1 .",
    "since @xmath120 must remain fixed we need a braiding process for mixed link diagrams that maps @xmath120 to @xmath5 ( and _ not _ an @xmath2equivalent braid or a conjugate of @xmath5 ) .",
    "such braids shall be called _ mixed braids _ ( see figure 28c for an example ) .",
    "also the subbraid of a mixed braid that complements @xmath5 shall be called _ the permutation braid_.      the fixed part @xmath120 may be viewed in @xmath0 as the braid @xmath5 union an arc , @xmath129 say , at infinity .",
    "this arc is the identification of the two horizontal arcs containing the endpoints of @xmath5 and thus it realizes the closure of @xmath5 .",
    "( in figure 28a the braid @xmath5 is drawn curved but this is just for the purpose of picturing it . )",
    "let @xmath130 be a small regular neighbourhood of @xmath129 and let @xmath2 be a link in @xmath1 . by general position @xmath2 misses @xmath130 and therefore it can be isotoped into the complement of @xmath130 in @xmath0 .    by expanding @xmath130 we can view its complement as the cylinder @xmath131 that contains @xmath5 ( figure 28b ) .",
    "we then apply our braiding in @xmath132 .",
    "this will leave @xmath5 untouched but it will braid @xmath2 in @xmath132 .",
    "finally we cut @xmath120 open along @xmath129 in order to obtain a mixed braid ( figure 28c ) .",
    "an alternative more ` rigid ' proof modifying the braiding of section 3 is given in @xcite,@xcite have counter - clockwise orientation ; then we cut the braid open along a line that starts from the central point and cuts through the closing side of @xmath120 . ] .      two oriented links in @xmath0 which contain a common subbraid @xmath5 are isotopic rel @xmath5 if and only if any two corresponding mixed braids @xmath127 and @xmath134 are @xmath2equivalent by moves that do not touch the common subbraid @xmath5 .    further any oriented links in @xmath126 are isotopic in @xmath126 if and only if any two corresponding mixed braids @xmath127 and @xmath135 in @xmath0 are @xmath2equivalent by moves that do not touch the common subbraid @xmath5 .      consider an isotopy of a link @xmath2 in the complement of @xmath136 . by a general position argument",
    "we may assume that this isotopy only crosses the arc @xmath129 a finite number of times and that these crossings are clear vertical cuts ( figure 29a ) .",
    "the neighbourhood @xmath130 misses also the isotopy apart from those clear crossings . as in the proof above , we expand @xmath130 and thus the isotopy now takes place inside @xmath132 apart from the crossings with @xmath129 .",
    "applying now the proof of theorem 2.3 , the isotopies within @xmath132 can be converted into a sequence of @xmath2moves that do not affect @xmath5 .",
    "therefore it only remains to check @xmath2equivalence at a crossing of @xmath2 with @xmath129 .",
    "but after expanding @xmath130 such a crossing looks like exchanging a braid strand , @xmath137 say , that runs along the front of the mixed braid for one with the same endpoints that runs along the back of the braid ( figure 29b ) .      if @xmath137 is an up  arc it can be made into a free up  arc and so it dissappears after the braiding .",
    "if @xmath137 is a down  arc we introduce an @xmath18move at its top part so that between the endpoints of the new strand and the endpoints of @xmath137 there is no other braid strand .",
    "we then undo an @xmath19move as depicted below , and the proof is concluded .",
    "note that it is necessary to use the version of an @xmath2move with a crossing ( recall figure 5 ) .",
    "let @xmath1 be a closed connected orientable ( c.c.o . )",
    "it is well  known @xcite , @xcite , @xcite that @xmath1 can be obtained by surgery on a framed link in @xmath0 with integral framings and w.l.o.g .",
    "this link is the closure @xmath136 of a braid @xmath5 .",
    "we shall refer to @xmath136 as the _ surgery link _ and we shall write @xmath140 . moreover by the proof given in @xcite it can be assumed that all the components of the surgery link are unknotted and furthermore that they form the closure of a pure braid .",
    "thus we may assume that @xmath5 is a pure braid .",
    "so @xmath1 may be represented in @xmath0 by the framed @xmath136 and if we fix @xmath136 pointwise we have that links / braids in @xmath1 can be unambiguously represented by mixed links / braids in @xmath0  exactly as discussed in 5.1 .",
    "thus theorem 5.3 holds also in this case . only here",
    ", the braid @xmath5 is framed and we refer to it as the _ surgery braid_. now a link @xmath2 in @xmath1 may be seen as a link in @xmath126 with the extra freedom to slide across the 2discs bounded in @xmath1 by the specified longitudes of the components of @xmath136 .",
    "let @xmath141 be the oriented boundary of a ribbon and let @xmath142 and @xmath143 be two oriented mixed links , so that @xmath143 is the band connected sum ( over @xmath141 ) of a component , @xmath144 , of @xmath107 and the specified ( from the framing ) longitude of a surgery component of @xmath136 .",
    "this is a non  isotopy move in @xmath0 that reflects isotopy between @xmath107 and @xmath108 in @xmath1 and we shall call it _ band move_. a band move can be thus split in two steps : firstly , one of the small edges of @xmath141 is glued to a part of @xmath144 so that the orientation of the band agrees with the orientation of @xmath144 .",
    "the other small edge of @xmath141 , which we shall call _ little band _ ( in ambiguity with the notion of a band ) , approaches a surgery component of @xmath136 in an arbitrary way .",
    "secondly , the little band is replaced by a string running in parallel with the specified longitude of the surgery component in such a way that the orientation of the string agrees with the orientation of @xmath141 and the resulting link is @xmath143 .",
    "since we consider oriented links in @xmath1 there are two types , @xmath58 and @xmath6 say , of band moves according as in the second step the orientation of the string replacing the little band agrees ( type @xmath58 ) or disagrees ( type @xmath6 ) with the orientation of the surgery component  and implicitely of its specified longitude .",
    "( see figure 31 , where @xmath145 is an integral framing of the surgery component . )",
    "\\(1 ) let @xmath142 and @xmath143 represent the isotopic links @xmath107 and @xmath108 in @xmath1 .",
    "if in the isotopy sequence there is no band move involved on the mixed link level , then @xmath107 and @xmath108 are also isotopic in @xmath126 . in particular , the first step of a band move reflects isotopy in @xmath126 .",
    "so , from now on whenever we say ` band move ' we will always be referring to the realization of the second step of a band move . ( 2 ) a band move , that is , the second step of the move described in definition 5.6 , takes place in an arbitrarily thin tubular neighbourhood of the component of the surgery link that contains no other part of the mixed link ; and since @xmath136 is pointwise fixed it follows that this tubular neighbourhood projects the same for any diagram of @xmath143 .",
    "so by ` band move ' we may unambiguously refer to both the move in the 3space and its projection .",
    "the discussion can be summarized by saying that link isotopy in @xmath1 can be regarded as isotopy in @xmath149 together with a finite ( by transversality ) number of band moves .",
    "therefore theorem 5.2 extends to :    two ( oriented ) links in @xmath1 are isotopic if and only if any two corresponding mixed link diagrams differ by a finite sequence of the band moves , the extented reidemeister moves and also by planar @xmath4moves and the reidemeister moves for the standard parts of the mixed links .",
    "note now that neither of the two types of band moves can appear as a move between braids ; so in order to state our extension of markov s theorem we modify the band move of type @xmath58 appropriately by twisting the little band before performing the move .",
    "so we have the following .    a _ braid band move _ or , abbreviated , a _",
    "b.b.move _ is a move between mixed braids that reflects isotopy in @xmath140 and is described by the following picture ( where the middle stage is only indicative ) .",
    "let @xmath107 , @xmath108 be two oriented links in @xmath1 and let @xmath151 , @xmath152 be two corresponding mixed braids in @xmath0 .",
    "then @xmath107 is isotopic to @xmath108 if and only if @xmath151 is equivalent to @xmath152 by the braid band moves and under @xmath2equivalence that does not affect @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath153 and @xmath154 be two mixed link diagrams of the mixed links representing @xmath107 and @xmath108 . by theorems 5.8 and 5.5 we only have to check that",
    "if @xmath155 and @xmath156 differ by a band move then @xmath151 and @xmath152 differ by b.b.moves and @xmath2equivalence that does not affect @xmath5 . in @xmath157 the little band would be like      depending on the orientation . if the little band is an opposite arc , w.l.o.g .",
    "we may assume that it satisfies the triangle condition .",
    "the algorithm we use ensures that we may assume that @xmath155 and @xmath159 are braided everywhere except for the little band in @xmath155 ( if it is an opposite arc ) and its replacement after the performance of the band move .",
    "this happens because the band move takes place arbitrarily close to the surgery strand ; so we can produce such a zone locally in the braid ( figure 35 ) , and consequently a b.b.move can not create problems with the triangle condition",
    ".      moreover the new strand from the band move ( as far as other crossings are concerned ) behaves in the same way as the surgery string itself .",
    "so , whenever we meet other opposite arcs we label them in the same way that we would do if the new strand were missing .          * proof .",
    "* we start with the left part of move _ ( i ) _ and we twist the little band ( isotopy in @xmath126 ) using a _ negative _ crossing . then we perform a b.b.move with a _ positive _ crossing and we end up with the right part of move _ ( i ) _ ( see figure 38 ) .        *",
    "* we start with the right part of move _ ( ii)_. in the front of the otherwise braided link",
    "we do a twist of the new string using a _ negative _ crossing ( see figure 40 ) .",
    "then we consider the little twisted arc as a little band and we perform another b.b.move around the same surgery component .",
    "this second band move takes place closer to the surgery component than the first one .",
    "now , the shaded region in the picture below is formed by two similar sets of opposite twists of the same string around the surgery string .",
    "so it bounds a disc ( together with the little band that is missing ) , the circumference of which is _ not _ linked with the surgery component ; but this is isotopic in @xmath126 to the left part of move _ ( ii)_. i.e. move _ ( ii ) _ is a finite sequence of @xmath2moves and b.b.moves .",
    "note that in the pictures above we have included another string of the mixed braid that links with the surgery component .",
    "clearly this does not affect the proof .",
    "the proof of theorem 5.10 is now concluded .",
    "\\(1 ) the proof holds even if the surgery braid is not a pure braid . in this case a b.b.move is modified so that the replacement of the little band links only with one of the strings of the same surgery component and runs in parallel to all remaining strings of the surgery component .",
