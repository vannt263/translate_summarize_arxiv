    "this paper is devoted to the study of mechanical devices called _ hexapods _ , which are also known as _",
    "stewart gough platforms_. as described in  @xcite , the geometry of this kind of mechanical manipulators is defined by the coordinates of the  @xmath0 platform points @xmath1 and of the  @xmath0 base points @xmath2 in one of their possible configurations .",
    "a hexapod is called _ planar _ if both base points and platform points are coplanar , otherwise _ non - planar_.    all pairs of points @xmath3 are connected by a rigid body , called _ leg _ , so that for all possible configurations the distance @xmath4 is preserved ( see fig .",
    "[ figure : hexapod ] ) .",
    "we say that a hexapod is _ movable _ , or admits a _ self - motion _ if , once we fix the position of the base points @xmath5 , the platform points @xmath6 are allowed to move in an ( at least ) one - dimensional set of configurations respecting the constraints given by the legs . in this case , each  @xmath7 moves on the sphere with center  @xmath8 and radius  @xmath9 .",

    "then one may define various invariants of a hexapod , such as the degree or the genus of its configuration curve .",
    "clearly the degree depends on the embedding of the algebraic group  @xmath22 in projective space .",
    "we mainly use the so - called conformal embedding @xmath24 described in  @xcite because it is most practical for the study of hexapods ; in this way we define the _ conformal degree _ of a hexapod . in the literature ( see for example  @xcite ) it is more common to project the configuration curve to  @xmath25 and use the well - known embedding @xmath26 determined by quaternions . in this case",
    "we call the degree of the configuration curve the _ euler degree _ , since the coordinates of  @xmath27 are called _",
    "euler parameters_.    the classification of hexapods with mobility one is still an open problem .",
    "there is a family of planar hexapods , discovered by duporq ( see  @xcite ) , with a configuration curve of conformal degree  @xmath28 , euler degree  @xmath29 , and genus  @xmath30 ( see section  [ degree ] ) ; these are the largest possible degrees and genus .",
    "the family we introduce in this paper is non - planar and has conformal degree  @xmath31 and euler degree  @xmath32 .",
    "we show that this is the maximal degree among non - planar hexapods if we exclude some degenerate cases . by the way , in this case",
    "the genus of the configuration curve is  @xmath33 , but we do not know whether this is maximal or not .",
    "our linkages are constructed in the following way .",
    "we start with  @xmath0 points @xmath34 in  @xmath23 , forming the base .",
    "then we employ basic facts from liaison theory  a method coming from algebraic geometry  to construct a system of equations for the @xmath0 points @xmath35 forming the platform .",
    "we conjecture that this system admits solutions for a general choice of  @xmath36 .",
    "once @xmath37 is fixed ( up to scaling ) , we derive linear equations for a scalar  @xmath38 and a vector @xmath39 implying that the hexapod @xmath40 has mobility one , with a configuration curve of degree  @xmath31 .",
    "we conjecture that this system of equations has a unique solution for  @xmath38 and a three - dimensional set of solutions for the vector  @xmath41 .",
    "we call a hexapod constructed by this procedure a _ liaison hexapod_. the nature of the two conjectures is so that if they are false , then they are falsified by a general choice of base points .",
    "we tested the conjectures against many random choices , so there is quite a strong experimental evidence in their favor .",
    "in addition , we found two particular subfamilies ( see proposition  [ proposition : family_lines ] and proposition  [ proposition : family_order3 ] ) for which we can prove that the properties predicted by the conjectures hold .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ degree ] , we prove our main theorem ( theorem  [ thm : bound_degree ] ) concerning the degree bound for configuration curves of general non - planar hexapods of mobility one ; this is achieved by bounding the degree by the number of intersections of two algebraic curves , and then by using some facts from algebraic geometry to control such number .",
    "the remaining sections deal with the construction of examples . in section  [ liaison_hexapods ] , we describe liaison hexapods : given a general @xmath0-tuple  @xmath36 , we construct  up to a scaling factor  a candidate platform  @xmath37 applying liaison theory and mbius photogrammetry , a technique used by the authors in  @xcite to establish necessary conditions for the mobility of pentapods . after",
    "that we determine the right scaling factor for the platform points and the leg lengths so that the hexapod we obtain is movable ; both these tasks are achieved by inspection of tangency conditions for the configuration curve of the hexapod . in section",
    "[ study ] , we prove with the aid of symbolic computation that the properties predicated by our conjectures hold in the case of two particular subfamilies of hexapods , and we exhibit an example of a liaison hexapod .",
    "the goal of this section is to associate to each hexapod  @xmath42 a projective curve  @xmath43 , called the _ configuration curve _ of  @xmath42 .",
    "its degree , called the _ conformal degree _ of  @xmath42 , is an invariant of the hexapod , and in this paper we are interested in understanding what are its possible maximal values .",
    "in particular we report well - known examples of hexapods attaining high values for the conformal degree , and eventually we prove a bound for the degree of a hexapod satisfying some non - degeneracy conditions ( theorem  [ thm : bound_degree ] ) .",
    "we recall some definitions from  @xcite that we need in our discussion .",
    "following many other authors , we describe the set of admissible configurations of a given hexapod  @xmath42 by prescribing the set of direct isometries ( from  @xmath23 to itself ) mapping the initial position of the platform to an admissible one . by this",
    "we mean that we consider the base  @xmath36 as fixed , and if @xmath37 is the initial position of the platform points , we look for all @xmath44 ( where @xmath22 denotes the group of direct isometries ) such that @xmath45 where @xmath9 are the given leg lengths of the hexapod  @xmath42 . the constraints imposed on isometries @xmath44 by eq .   are called _",
    "spherical conditions_.    as shown in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  2 , subsection  2.1 ) , it is possible to construct a projective compactification in  @xmath46 for ( the complexification of ) the group  @xmath22 ; we denote it by  @xmath47 .",
    "it turns out that  @xmath47 is a projective variety of dimension  @xmath0 and degree  @xmath28 .",
    "we call the map @xmath48 the _ _ conformal embedding _ _ of  @xmath22 .",
    "if we write the spherical condition in the coordinates of  @xmath46 , we obtain six linear conditions , namely we determine a linear subspace @xmath49 of codimension  @xmath0 . the intersection @xmath50 is defined to be the _ complex configuration set _ of the hexapod  @xmath42 .",
    "let @xmath42 be a hexapod .",
    "the _ mobility _ of  @xmath42 is defined to be the dimension of @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the complexification of  @xmath22 embedded in  @xmath47 . for a hexapod of mobility one",
    "we define the _ conformal degree _ to be the degree of the projective curve  @xmath43 .    from the fact that @xmath47 is a variety of degree",
    "@xmath28 and @xmath43 is always a linear section of  @xmath47 we immediately see that the conformal degree is always smaller than or equal to  @xmath28",
    ".    one can also attach another degree to a hexapod , by considering only the rotational part of the isometries determining its configuration .",
    "this is classically done by embedding the ( complexification of the ) group of rotations  @xmath25 as an open subset of  @xmath27 using the quaternionic description of rotations . in this way we get for a mobility one hexapod",
    "@xmath42 a curve in  @xmath27 , and its degree is called the _ euler degree _ of  @xmath42 .",
    "note that we obtain a point in  @xmath27 if the corresponding self - motion is a pure translation . in this case",
    "we set the euler degree to zero .",
    "if @xmath53 is the map sending a direct isometry to its rotational part , by analyzing the definition of the conformal embedding one sees that there exists a linear projection @xmath54 such that the following diagram is commutative : @xmath55 \\ar[d]_{\\rho } & & x \\ar@{}[r]|{\\subseteq }   \\ar@{-->}[d ] & { \\mathbb{p}}^{16}_{{\\mathbb{c } } } \\ar@{-->}[d ] \\\\ { \\mathrm{so}_3}\\ar[r ] & { \\mathbb{p}}^3_{{\\mathbb{c } } }   \\ar[r]^-{v_{3,2 } } & v_{3,2 } \\ar@{}[r]|{\\subseteq } & { \\mathbb{p}}^9_{{\\mathbb{c } } } }     \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the veronese embedding of  @xmath57 by quadrics and @xmath58 is its image in  @xmath59 .",
    "if we have a closer look at  @xmath47 , we discover that it can be written as the disjoint union @xmath60  where @xmath61 is a special hyperplane section of  @xmath47 , called the _",
    "boundary_. the boundary can be , in turn , decomposed into  @xmath62 subsets :    vertex : :    the only real point in  @xmath61 , a singular point with    multiplicity  @xmath29 ; it is never contained in the complex    configuration set of a hexapod ; collinearity points : :    if @xmath43 contains such a point , then either the    platform points or the base points are collinear ; similarity points : :    if @xmath43 contains such a point , then there are normal    projections of platform and base to a plane such that the images are    similar ; inversion points : :    if @xmath43 contains such a point , then there are normal    projections of platform and base to a plane such that the images are    related by an inversion ; butterfly points : :    if @xmath43 contains such a point , then there are two    lines , one in the base and one in the platform , such that any leg has    either a base point in the base line or a platform point in the    platform line .    [ remark : center_projection ] the center of the projection @xmath63 sending  @xmath47 to the veronese variety  @xmath58 is the linear space spanned by similarity points , which contains also the collinearity points and the vertex .",
    "inversion points form an open subset of  @xmath61 , while all other sets of points form proper ( quasi - projective ) subvarieties of  @xmath61 .",
    "the points of the configuration set  @xmath43 of a hexapod  @xmath42 that lie on the boundary  @xmath61 are called the _ bonds _ of  @xmath42 . as we see from the previous description , although bonds do not represent configurations , their presence constrains the geometry of the corresponding hexapod .",
    "we now discuss a few well - known special cases of hexapods attaining high values for the conformal and the euler degree , mainly in order to exclude them later , when stating and proving our main theorem ( theorem  [ thm : bound_degree ] ) .      for a general planar pentapod ,",
    "it is possible to add an additional leg without changing the configuration set ( see  @xcite ) , hence obtaining a movable hexapod .",
    "its configuration curve is the intersection of  @xmath47 with a linear subspace of codimension  @xmath62 , hence it has conformal degree  @xmath28 , and its euler degree is  @xmath29 .",
    "the genus can easily be computed by the hilbert series of  @xmath47 , and it turns out to be  @xmath30 is half - canonical , namely embedded by a linear system  @xmath64 such that @xmath65 is canonical . ] .      a hexapod is called _ equiform _ if there is a similarity @xmath66 mapping base points to platform points .",
    "non - planar equiform hexapods are discussed in  @xcite .",
    "equiform hexapods of mobility one admit configuration curves of degree  @xmath67 .",
    "the assumption on the existence of the similarity implies that for every direction in  @xmath23 , the projections of both base and platform points along that direction are similar , hence every direction in  @xmath23 determines a similarity point in  @xmath43 .",
    "therefore the intersection of  @xmath43 with the boundary  @xmath61 is a curve , and one can show that it is actually a conic .",
    "thus the configuration curve of such a hexapod has two components , one given by the zariski closure of @xmath68 , and the other by the intersection of @xmath43 with  @xmath61 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath42 is neither planar nor equiform , then @xmath69 intersects  @xmath61 in at most a finite number of points ( see  @xcite ) . for this case , we show a useful proposition relating the conformal degree and the euler degree .    [ proposition : euler_conformal ] let @xmath42 be a mobility one hexapod , neither planar nor equiform , then its euler degree is at most half its conformal degree .",
    "consider the linear projection @xmath63 from diagram  .",
    "then the configuration curve  @xmath43 is mapped by such projection to a curve  @xmath70 in  @xmath58 such that the preimage of  @xmath70 under the veronese embedding  @xmath56 determines the euler degree of  @xmath42 .",
    "let @xmath71 be the number of intersection points , counted with multiplicity , of  @xmath69 with the center of the projection . since by remark  [ remark : center_projection ] this is the cardinality of similarity bonds plus the cardinality of collinearity bonds of  @xmath42 , the number  @xmath71 is finite",
    ". by a well - known formula for the degree of a projection , the degree of the image of  @xmath69 is a factor of  @xmath72 , where  @xmath73 is the conformal degree , with equality if and only if the restriction of the projection to  @xmath69 is birational to the image . on the other hand ,",
    "the veronese map just doubles the degree , hence the statement follows .",
    "we aim at bounding the conformal degree of a hexapod  @xmath42 that satisfies some genericity assumptions ( for example , we will assume @xmath42 to be non - planar and non - equiform ) , and we will determine it by means of two estimates : first of all we connect the conformal degree to the intersection number of two algebraic curves defined by base and platform points only , and then the latter will be bounded using some arguments from algebraic geometry .",
    "to do so we need to introduce a new tool , called _ mbius photogrammetry _ , and this is the content of the next subsection .",
    "notice that a necessary condition for the mobility of a hexapod is the existence of bonds of some type : in fact if a hexapod  @xmath42 is movable , then its configuration set  @xmath43 intersects the boundary  @xmath61 non - trivially . in particular , when the mobility is one , the bigger the degree of  @xmath43 , the bigger the number of bonds  counted with multiplicity .",
    "if we assume that @xmath42 is neither planar nor equiform nor does it satisfy a butterfly condition , but has mobility one , then by the characterization of boundary points we get that there exist planar projections of base and platform such that their images are related by either a similarity or an inversion . in the second case",
    ", we can replace the inversion also by the composition of the inversion with a reflection , by considering the projection from the opposite direction .",
    "then , in both cases , we have projections of base and platform points that are mbius equivalent , i.e.  equivalent up to mbius transformations .",
    "hence , if we are interested in hexapods with high conformal degree , then we should look for hexapods with a high number of bonds . since the presence of inversion or similarity bonds corresponds to mbius equivalent orthogonal projections of base and platform , we are going to study such projections .      in  @xcite",
    "the authors introduced the concept of _ mbius photogrammetry _ for @xmath62-tuples of points in  @xmath23 , and this technique allowed to deduce some results about pentapods with mobility two .",
    "the idea behind it is to take `` pictures '' of a configuration of  @xmath62 points in  @xmath23 , namely consider its orthogonal projection onto  @xmath74 along all possible directions , and try to deduce properties of this configuration in  @xmath23 from the knowledge of its projections .",
    "we briefly recall the construction of the photographic map , adapting it to our setting , namely considering @xmath0-tuples of distinct points  for definitions and proofs we refer to  @xcite .",
    "we start with a vector  @xmath75 of  @xmath0 distinct points in  @xmath23 . for each direction @xmath76 in  @xmath23 ,",
    "where @xmath77 denotes the unit sphere , we consider an orthogonal projection @xmath78 along  @xmath79 .",
    "hence for each @xmath80 we have a tuple @xmath81 of projected points of  @xmath82 , namely we have a @xmath0-tuple of elements of  @xmath74 . by identifying  @xmath74 with  @xmath83 and embedding the latter in  @xmath84",
    ", we can think of  @xmath85 as of an element of  @xmath86 .    since mbius transformations form the automorphism group of  @xmath84 , the following two concepts are equivalent :    * a @xmath0-tuple @xmath85 in @xmath87 , considered up to mbius transformations ; * a @xmath0-tuple @xmath85 in @xmath86 , considered up to automorphism of @xmath84 .",
    "let @xmath88 denote the moduli space of  @xmath0 points in  @xmath84 , and denote by @xmath89 the corresponding quotient map , namely the function sending a configuration of @xmath0 points to its class modulo automorphisms of  @xmath84 .",
    "the previous notation encodes the fact that @xmath90 is not defined on the whole  @xmath91 , since we know from geometric invariant theory that we need to restrict to the open set  @xmath92 of  @xmath93 of @xmath0-tuples where no four points coincide in order to build a well - behaved theory .",
    "the previous equivalence allows us to think of a @xmath0-tuple @xmath85 of points in  @xmath74 , considered up to mbius transformations , as a point in  @xmath88 , in particular as the image of  @xmath85 under the quotient map  @xmath90 . in order to give an explicit formulation of the quotient map  @xmath90",
    "we follow , as in  @xcite , the graphical approach provided in  @xcite :    * consider a convex hexagon in the plane and construct all plane undirected multigraphs without loops whose set of vertices coincides with the set of vertices of the hexagon and that satisfy the following conditions : * * edges are given by segments ; * * any two edges do not intersect ; * * the valency of every vertex is  @xmath94 .",
