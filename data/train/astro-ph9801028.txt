    "in recent years , an increasing amount of attention has been devoted to calculating more accurately the effects on the rates of solar fusion reactions of electrostatic screening in the solar plasma ( carraro , schfer , & koonin 1988 ; johnston , kolbe , koonin , & langanke 1992 ; bahcall & pinsonneault 1992 ; shoppa , koonin , langanke , & seki 1993 ; dzitko , turck - chize , delbourgo - salvador , & lagrange 1995 ; ricci , deglinnocenti , & fiorentini 1995 ; gruzinov & bahcall 1997 ; brown & sawyer 1997 ; brggen & gough 1997 ) .",
    "all of these discussions take as their starting point the classical analysis by salpeter ( 1954 ) .",
    "the primary reason for making more precise calculations is that nuclear fusion reactions produce the solar neutrino fluxes ( see http://www.sns.ias.edu/  jnb ) .",
    "the neutrino fluxes are being observed with a number of large new detectors that are expected to yield flux measurements of high accuracy ( of the order of a few percent or better , see bahcall et al .",

    ", we calculate for the first time the electron density in the vicinity of the fusing nuclei using the partial differential equation for the density matrix that is derived in quantum statistical mechanics . in previous treatments of screening that attempted to go beyond the linear regime ,",
    "the electron density near the nucleus was either taken to be  without quantitative justification  the unperturbed value , @xmath1 ( mitler 1977 ; dzitko , turck - chize , delbourgo - salvador , & lagrange 1995 ) or left as a free parameter ( ricci et al .",
    "1995 ) or the electrons were assumed to be completely degenerate ( graboske , dewitt , grossman , & cooper 1973 ) .",
    "we calculate screening corrections in a mean field approximation ; we numerically solve the nonlinear poisson - boltzmann equation for a mixture of electrons and ions .",
    "the electron density distribution calculated from the density matrix equation is included self - consistently and iteratively in the mean field equation .",
    "our results represent both an improvement on , and a simplification of , the description of nuclear fusion used in many solar evolution codes .    for simple physical reasons ,",
    "our results differ from the interpolation formulae that are currently used to describe reaction rates in the sun ( salpeter & van horn 1969 ; graboske et al .",
    "1973 ) , and the numerical calculations of dzitko , turck - chize , delbourgo - salvador , & lagrange ( 1995 ) .",
    "interpolation formulae describe a transition between salpeter s weak screening , which is due to both electrons and ions , and strong screening , for which only ions are effective . at the high densities relevant for strong screening",
    ", electrons are fully degenerate .",
    "the solar core , however , is only weakly degenerate , and the effects of degeneracy are already included into the debye radius , @xmath2 ( which is increased @xmath3% by electron degeneracy , cf .",
    "( [ defnzeta ] ) of the present paper or eq .",
    "( 25 ) of salpeter 1954 ) .",
    "therefore , the interpolation formulae in use underestimate the electron contribution to screening and give reaction rates lower than ours",
    ".    the numerical procedures of dzitko , turck - chize , delbourgo - salvador , & lagrange ( 1995 ) and mitler ( 1977 ) predict reaction rates that are too slow for heavy ions because they assumed that the electron charge density near a screened nucleus is the unperturbed value , @xmath4 .",
    "this assumption seriously underestimates the charge density near heavy ions .",
    "for example , it is known that a screened beryllium nucleus under solar interior conditions has charge density near the nucleus @xmath5 ( gruzinov & bahcall 1997 , brown & sawyer 1997 ; all quantum mechanical calculations give similar results , see bahcall 1962 and iben , kalata , & schwartz 1967 ) .",

    "2 we review the basic concepts and in  3 we relate the electrostatic energy to the screening enhancement using the free energy . we describe the calculations in  4 and summarize the numerical results in  5 . in  6 we summarize our main results and present the conclusions regarding solar neutrino fluxes .",
    "the appendix evaluates a quantum correction to the kinetic energy of thermal electrons in the electrostatic field of a screened nucleus .",
    "the solar core plasma is dense enough that it noticeably enhances fusion rates as compared to the rates in a rarefied plasma of the same temperature . as explained by salpeter ( 1954 ) ,",
    "the rate of a fusion of two nuclei of charges @xmath6 and @xmath7 is increased by a factor @xmath8 where @xmath9 here @xmath2 is the debye radius , @xmath10 with @xmath11    here @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the baryon density , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are , respectively , the mass fraction , the nuclear charge , and the atomic weight of ions of type @xmath16 .",

    "the approximation of considering only a hydrogen and helium plasma rather than the full solar composition ( cf .",
    "grevesse & noels 1993 ) causes an error of less than 0.5% in computing solar fusion rates .",
    "this error is completely unimportant for our purpose of estimating the ratio of the total screening to the weak screening value given by eqs .",
    "( [ deff])([defnzeta ] ) .",
    "the enhancement of fusion rates due to screening depends only very weakly upon location in the solar interior ( cf .",

    "unfortunately , this clear derivation can not be used if we go beyond the debye - hckel approximation and include nonlinear screening effects . given a numerically calculated potential around the charge @xmath6 , @xmath40",
    ", we can not assume that the enhancement factor is equal to @xmath38 with @xmath41 .",
    "this is already obvious from the asymmetry of this expression under the 1 - 2 permutation ; @xmath42 is not just proportional to @xmath6 for nonlinear screening .    in the more general case considered here",
    ", the enhancement of fusion rates due to screening can be calculated in terms of an expression involving the free energy of a screened charge @xmath43 , @xmath44 . in terms of free energy ,",
    "the enhancement factor is simply ( dewitt , graboske , & cooper 1973 ) @xmath38 with @xmath45 which is a manifestly symmetrical expression .",

    "the extra work performed by the plasma due to screening is positive , pushing the fusing ions closer together .",
    "for a given relative kinetic energy when the ions fuse , the initial kinetic energy is lower by @xmath47 than in the absence of screening . therefore , the probability of the fusing configuration is increased , i.e. , the reaction rates are faster , by a factor @xmath48 .    the free energy can be calculated in terms of electrostatic energy using the thermodynamic formula @xmath49 the lower limit in the integral in eq .",

    "the fusing nuclei are well separated whenever screening is relevant ; their combined self - energies are the same in the fusing state as the sum of the self - energies in the initial ( infinitely separated ) state .",
    "most of the acceleration of the fusing nuclei occurs at distances larger than @xmath54 , which is four orders of magnitude larger than nuclear radii .",

    "in the mean field approximation , electrostatic screening of a charge @xmath43 is described by the poisson - boltzmann equation @xmath64 where the terms on the right hand side represent , respectively , screening by electrons , protons and alphas .",
    "the boundary condition is @xmath65 for @xmath66 . in the non - linear regime",
    ", one can not solve the poisson - boltzmann equation as written .",
    "classical electrons recombine , which corresponds formally to the divergence of the classical boltzmann factor @xmath67 near the nucleus .",
    "this problem does not arise in previous solutions of the poisson - boltzmann equation which were carried out in the linear regime corresponding to weak screening .",
    "quantum statistical mechanics must be used for calculating terms beyond the weak screening approximation .",
    "fortunately , electron degeneracy makes only a small correction , less than @xmath3% in the debye radius , see eq .",

    "hence , a distinguishable particles approximation can be employed .",

    "<S> we evaluate the effect of electrostatic screening by ions and electrons on low - z thermonuclear reactions in the sun . </S>",
    "<S> we use a mean field formalism and calculate the electron density of the screening cloud using the appropriate density matrix equation of quantum statistical mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> because of well understood physical effects that are included for the first time in our treatment , the calculated enhancement of reaction rates does not agree with the frequently used interpolation formulae . </S>",
    "<S> our result does agree , within small uncertainties , with salpeter s weak screening formula . </S>",
    "<S> if weak screening is used instead of the commonly employed screening prescription of graboske et al . , the predicted @xmath0b neutrino flux is increased by 7% and the predicted chlorine rate is increased by 0.4 snu .    </S>"
