    "the field had a boost after george kingsley zipf , around 75 years ago , found an empirical law ( zipf s law ) @xcite describing a seemingly universal property of the written language .",
    "it states that the number of occurrences of a word in a long enough written text falls off as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the occurrence - rank of a word ( the smaller rank , the more occurrences ) @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "this in turn means that the normalized word - frequency distribution ( wfd ) follows the expression @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the probability to find a word which appears @xmath7 times in a text @xcite .",
    "this empirical law is generally believed to represent some ubiquitous nature of the wfd , and has inspired the development of several models reproducing this structure @xcite@xcite .",
    "however , empirically one typically finds that the wfd follows a power - law distribution with an exponent smaller than 2 @xcite@xcite .",
    "it was also reported in ref .",
    "@xcite that the exponent ( commonly denoted as @xmath0 ) for a power - law description of the wfd seems to change with the length of a text , rather than being constant .",
    "another property is the number of different ( unique ) words , @xmath8 , as a function of the total number of words in a book , @xmath9 ( in this context a book is a sequence of words where words are defined as collections of letters separated by spaces ) .",
    "the conventional way of describing this relation is by using heap s law @xcite , which states that @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a constant .    in this paper",
    "we present , and give evidence for , a meta book concept which is an abstract picture of how an author writes a text .",
    "we suggest a systematic text - length dependence for the wfd which is directly connected to an extended heap s law with an @xmath12 changing from 1 to 0 as the text length is increased from @xmath13 to infinity .",
    "we start by studying the above mentioned property , @xmath14 .",
    "figure 1 shows this curve for three different authors ( * * h**ardy , * * m**elville and * * l**awrence ) .",
    "we have created very large books by attaching novels together , in order to extend the range of book sizes ( see appendix a for a full list of books ) .",
    "the curve shows a decreasing rate of adding new words which means that @xmath8 grows slower than linear ( @xmath15 ) @xcite@xcite . also , for a real book , @xmath16 which means that the proportionality constant in heap s law must be one .",
    "so , if @xmath17 then @xmath18 .",
    "this quantity is plotted in the inset of fig .  1 and the data shows that @xmath12 is decreasing as a function of the size , ruling out the possibility to accurately describe the @xmath14-curve using a constant @xmath12 .",
    "a plausible scenario would be that @xmath12 continue to decrease assymptotically towards zero as @xmath9 reaches infinity .",

    "when the length of a text is increased , the number of different words is also increased .",
    "however , the average usage of a specific word is not constant , but increases as well .",
    "that is , we tend to repeat the words more when writing a longer text .",
    "one might argue that this is because we have a limited vocabulary and when writing more words the probability to repeat an old word increases .",
    "but , at the same time , a contradictory argument could be that the scenery and plot , described for example in a novel , are often broader in a longer text , leading to a wider use of ones vocabulary .",

    "the data is plotted as @xmath28 as a function of @xmath29 in order to get a feeling for the asymptotic behavior as @xmath9 reaches infinity .",
    "the overlap between the line and the points means that the average frequency of a word ( and consequently also @xmath8 ) in a short story is to good approximation the same as for a section , of equal length , from a larger text written by the same author .",
    "note that the texts has to be written by the same author since the overlap would not be nearly as good if books by lawrence were compared to the curve by melville .    in fig .",
    "2d - f , we literally pull out sections from a very large book and compare the result to a much smaller book ( with a size difference of a factor @xmath24 ) .",
    "the figures are showing the wfd for an @xmath24th part ( averaged over 200 sections ) of the full collection and a short story by the same author .",
    "the distribution for the full collection is also included for comparison .",
    "the overlap between the short story and the section of the big book implies that the wfd for a text can be recreated by taking a section of a larger book written by the same author .",
    "it does not matter if we pull out half of a book of size @xmath9 , or a fourth of a book of size @xmath30 .",
    "these findings lead us towards _ the meta book concept _ : the writing of a text can be described by a process where the author pulls a piece of text out of a large mother book ( the meta book ) and puts it down on paper .",
    "this meta book is an imaginary infinite book which gives a representation of the word frequency characteristics of everything that a certain author could ever think of writing .",
    "this has nothing to do with semantics and the actual meaning of what is written , but rather to the extent of the vocabulary , the level and type of education and the personal preferences of an author .",
    "the fact that people have such different backgrounds , together with the seemingly different behavior of the function @xmath14 for the different authors , opens up for the speculation that every person has its own and unique meta book , in which case it can be seen as a fingerprint of an author .",
    "yet another , more obvious , property is the frequency of the most common word , @xmath31 .",
    "when dividing a book in half , @xmath31 should also be cut in half .",
    "this linear relation between @xmath31 and @xmath9 is shown in fig .",
    "3 to be in agreement with the real data , which is consistent with the meta book concept .",
    "this follows because the most common word is most likely a `` filling word '' ( e.g.  `` the '' ) which would be evenly distributed throughout the text ( e.g.  every twentieth word or so ) .",
    ", as a function of the size of the book , @xmath9 , for the three authors in a log - log scale .",
    "]    so far we have been sectioning down books into smaller sizes , according to the meta book concept . but what happens if we go in the other direction and extrapolate to larger sizes ?",
    "what could the meta book look like ? in the next section",
    "we obtain the size dependences for the parameter values of the wfd in terms of @xmath12 and present the asymptotic limit of @xmath32 .",
    "to find the size dependence of the wfd we notice that there is a simple relation between the wfd and the @xmath23 .",
    "if the @xmath23 ( which is directly related to the @xmath14-curve , and thus to @xmath12 ) is changing with the size , the wfd also has to change in some way ( e.g.  smaller cut off or changed slope ) .",
    "but we also know that the tail of the distribution must be regulated in such a way that the maximum frequency does not go crazy ( e.g.  90% of all the words are the same ) , but is consistent with fig",
    ".  3 . given a functional form , what kind of relation between the functional parameters is needed to balance these requirements ? the requirements mentioned can be summarized in three basic assumptions supported by our previous analyses :    * the number of different words , @xmath8 , scales as the total number of words , @xmath9 , to some power that can change with m , @xmath10 , where @xmath33 can range between 1 and 0 .",
    "this means that the average frequency scales like @xmath34 . * the value , @xmath35 , defined through the cumulative word - frequency distribution as @xmath36 , should increase linearly with the size of the book",
    "that is , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a constant larger than zero . *",
    "the word - frequency distribution of a book is to a good approximation of the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath0 may depend on @xmath9 , so that @xmath42 , @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) and @xmath45 .",
    "the fact that @xmath8 can be expressed as @xmath46 is always true .",
    "the implicit assumptions made is that @xmath47 is a slowly and monotonically decreasing function from @xmath48 to @xmath49 .",
    "that a slowly varying @xmath12 can describe @xmath8 is plausible since a fair approximation is usually obtained by just a constant @xmath12 in the range @xmath11 ( heap s law ) .",
    "the limit @xmath48 is just the observation that the first couple of words one writes in a book are usually different , and the limit @xmath50 is the extreme limit where the author s vocabulary has been used so that no new words are added and the increase of @xmath8 approaches zero @xcite .",
    "the second assumption reflects the statement that if the most common word used by an author is `` the '' and one compares two text - lengths by the same author , where one is twice as long as the other , then the longer text contains on the average twice as many `` the ' 's as the shorter one .",
    "this statement can be expressed in terms of the cumulative normalized wfd , which is defined as @xmath51 .",
    "thus @xmath52 means that if a data set is created by drawing @xmath8 random numbers from a theoretical and continuous function , @xmath6 , then one would get , on the average , one word appearing with a frequency larger than @xmath35 .",
    "this word , with frequency @xmath31 , would then become the most common word in the text .",
    "so , @xmath35 is a theoretical limit , while @xmath31 is the actual frequency of the most common word .",
    "since the distribution @xmath6 is a rapidly decreasing function for large @xmath7 , the most common word always appear with a frequency very close to @xmath35 ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath54 , which means that @xmath37 is a vaild assumption to a good approximation .",
    "the first two assumptions can be expressed in the continuum approximation as two integral equations :    @xmath55    the third assumption is based on the notion that this functional form fits well to empirical data @xcite@xcite .",
    "the basic assumption made in the present context is that the power law with an exponential gives the correct large @xmath7 behavior and that @xmath40 and @xmath0 vary slowly with @xmath9 .",
    "next , we explore the consequences of the basic three assumptions but first the normalization condition is investigated . from eq .",
