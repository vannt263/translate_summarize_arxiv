    "<S> the brownian force model ( bfm ) is a mean - field model for the local velocities during avalanches in elastic interfaces of internal space dimension @xmath0 , driven in a random medium . </S>",
    "<S> it is exactly solvable via a non - linear differential equation . </S>",
    "<S> we study avalanches following a kick , i.e.  a step in the driving force . </S>",
    "<S> we first recall the calculation of the distributions of the global size ( total swept area ) and of the local jump size for an arbitrary kick amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> we extend this calculation to the joint density of local and global sizes within a single avalanche , in the limit of an infinitesimal kick . </S>",
    "<S> when the interface is driven by a single point we find new exponents @xmath1 and @xmath2 , depending on whether the force or the displacement is imposed . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the extension of a  single avalanche \" along one internal direction ( i.e.  the total length in @xmath3 ) is finite and we calculate its distribution , following either a local or a global kick . in all cases </S>",
    "<S> it exhibits a divergence @xmath4 at small @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> most of our results are tested in a numerical simulation in dimension @xmath3 . </S>"
