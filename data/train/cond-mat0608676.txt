    "presence of the anharmonicity in the @xmath46 potential is clearly visible in fig .",
    "the scales of @xmath47 are about the same for the a@xmath33 and e@xmath1 mode when measured in absolute displacements ( 0.1    corresponds , at ambient pressure , to @xmath48 or @xmath49 ) .",
    "we can see that , at low pressures , the energy variation in the e@xmath1 mode does not differ much from a parabolic shape : the main deviation shows as the slight asymmetry for positive and negative @xmath47 .",
    "the degree of asymmetry remains about the same when pressure is increased .",
    "this behavior is in stark contrast with the one seen in the a@xmath33 mode where , at @xmath50 , the @xmath46 is essentially symmetrical at small displacements ( @xmath51 ) but its asymmetry rapidly increases under compression , to reach at @xmath52  @xmath53  ( @xmath54 5.5  gpa ) an almost flat shape in one of the displacement directions .    a closer inspection of the a@xmath33 potential energy curves reveals , at low pressures ( @xmath54 1.58  gpa ) , a small energy - barrier around @xmath55 ; when pressure increases the barrier shifts to smaller values of @xmath56 and becomes lower .",
    "an expansion of the unit cell , on the contrary , makes the barrier higher and shifts its position to larger values of the displacement ( e.g. @xmath57    at @xmath58  gpa ) , where it is beyond the reach of the mean - square displacement at room temperature ( @xmath59   ) .",
    "it should be noted that the maximum of the barrier corresponds to the structural parameter @xmath60 .",

    "( sb ) and ( bi ) .",
    "more comprehensive information about the anharmonicity is provided by the variation of _ forces _ with displacements , which is also plotted in fig .",
    "now the harmonic regime is easily recognized by the _ linear _ variation of the restoring force @xmath62 against @xmath47 . at all volumes close to ambient pressure",
    "the a@xmath33 mode is harmonic , until approximately the displacements of @xmath42 , which is the value we chose for the frozen phonon calculations , to become conspicuously anharmonic at @xmath63  @xmath53 ( @xmath64  gpa ) . for the e@xmath1 mode , on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath65 seems to deviate little from the linear ( i.e. harmonic ) behavior for @xmath66 0.02 , even when pressure is increased .",

    "( color online ) results of frozen - phonon calculations ( lda and gga ) for sb in the @xmath0 structure : harmonic phonon frequencies at different unit cell volumes . the experimental data ( dashed lines ) are indicated for comparison .",
    "experimental pressure is converted to volume using a birch equation of state with experimental parameters given in table  [ tab2].,width=264 ]    this somewhat unexpected emergence of the non - parallel component @xmath68 reminds us that _ a multitude _ of different anharmonic terms can appear in the expansion of @xmath46 , and the presence of anharmonicity then can show up in two ways : ( 1 ) forces are not _ linear _ in @xmath47 and ( 2 ) forces are not necessarily _ parallel _ to the displacement ( see ref . ,",
    "it is the `` mixed '' @xmath69 terms in @xmath70 that are responsible for the `` non - parallelism '' of @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows that , while the `` parallel '' term @xmath18 seems to be significant in a@xmath33 , it is the large @xmath19 which gives rise to the non - zero component @xmath68 in e@xmath1 . dealing only with the @xmath46 variations ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) would , obviously , make us miss any mixed term in eqs .  .",
    "in the harmonic regime , using the hellmann - feynman forces merely offers a convenient , alternative way to explore the calculated @xmath46 data .",
    "however , in an anharmonic oscillator the knowledge of the variation @xmath73 provides us with additional information on the mixed terms in eqs .  .",
    "in the light of the above discussion , it does not come as a surprise finding out that the harmonic frequencies calculated from eq .",
    "( 1 ) agree rather imperfectly with the measured data shown in fig .",
    "however , the overall _ trend _ of the variation is correctly reproduced .",
    "in particular , the initial rate of the variation with volume is not far from the observed values and the larger nonlinearity in the softening of a@xmath5 mode is reproduced also .",
    "the discrepancies remind us that the ( calculated ) harmonic frequencies are not the quantity that is measured in the spectrum of an anharmonic oscillator .",
    "another contribution to the discrepancy is caused by a deviation of the optimized @xmath74 ratios from experimental values ( see appendix ) .",
    "an attempt to evaluate the frequency shifts or the line - broadenings in terms of some of the theories proposed in the past @xcite would lead us beyond the scope of this paper . in particular , one would have to assume that anharmonicity is _ the only _ mechanism responsible for the @xmath3 20 @xmath10 shifts appearing in fig .  [ fig7 ] , which is by no means certain @xcite .",
    "we have performed a high pressure raman scattering study of sb up to 16.6  gpa at room temperature . on the approach to the sb - i to sb - ii phase transition near 8 gpa , both the a@xmath5 and e@xmath6 zone - center phonon modes of the @xmath0 phase exhibit a pronounced softening , of the order -20% .",
    "frozen - phonon calculations yield harmonic phonon frequencies in reasonable agreement with the observed mode softening .",
    "the two raman lines of the a7 phase show an unusually large broadening under pressure .",
    "the fact that the lifetime of phonons decreases with increasing pressure could become important if , similar to bi @xcite , the effect of pressure on coherent phonon generation in sb were to become of interest .",
    "we report raman - active modes of the phase sb - ii which has a complex guest - host structure . for the sb - ii phase ,",
    "all the observed phonon features exhibit a hardening with increasing pressure , at least up to 16 gpa ; a correlation with the negative pressure coefficient of the superconducting transition temperature of sb - ii @xcite is apparent .    perhaps the most interesting question raised by the present study concerns the coupling of the zone - center optical phonons of the a7 phase of sb to other phonons ( e.g. anharmonic decay ) and possibly electronic processes ( electron - phonon coupling ) .",
    "it is the interplay between mode softening , electronic structure changes at the fermi level , and shifts of optical interband transitions ( i.e. resonances and penetration depth ) which leads to a more complex scenario of phonon decay processes compared to semiconducting materials .",
    "our low - temperature measurements of the raman line widths indicate that phonon - related processes are a major cause of the pressure - induced broadening .",
    "so , a first step towards gaining more insight would be to study the effect of pressure on the phonon dispersion relations , specifically the acoustic branches .",
    "the literature about different phases of antimony includes several studies based on _ first - principles _ calculations @xcite .",
    "an interesting problem had been the question of the existence of a cubic primitive ( @xmath75 ) structure of sb at pressures between 6 and 9  gpa .",
    "the @xmath75 structure can be viewed as a special case of @xmath0 with @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "first suggested experimentally in ref . , the reality of the @xmath75 phase was _ not _ confirmed in later diffraction studies of sb , e.g. refs .. since then the @xmath0 @xmath78 sb ii / iv transition is believed to be the first in the sequence of pressure - induced transitions of sb , and the cubic - primitive subject has occasionally appeared only in theoretical studies which slowly `` converged '' to elimination , on energetic grounds , of the @xmath75 phase from the list of stable phases of antimony .",

    "the corresponding volume range is larger .",
    "closed circles and open squares represent the tabulated experimental results @xcite .",

    "let s first consider the lda results . starting from large volume ,",
    "the calculated variation @xmath29 [ fig .  [ fig8](a ) ] is smooth first .",
    "when passing @xmath81  @xmath53 a _ kink _ appears in @xmath29 , followed by narrow interval of smooth variation , until @xmath82  @xmath53 .",
    "the kink in @xmath29 relates to the evolution of the structural parameters @xmath74 and @xmath79 [ figs .",
    "[ fig8](b , c ) ] . at the approach",
    "to @xmath80 @xmath53 the smooth decrease of @xmath74 changes slope and @xmath74 takes , practically discontinuously , values situated close to the cubic value @xmath77 . at the same volume , a nearly abrupt variation towards the cubic limit @xmath60 is also observed in the behavior of @xmath79 .",
    "however , the cubic limit of @xmath79 is only reached by a second jump near @xmath83 @xmath53 . at all volumes",
    "@xmath84  @xmath53 , the energy - minimization algorithms , set to conserve the @xmath2 symmetry , steer the iteration obstinately towards exactly @xmath60 , but with @xmath74 significantly larger again than the cubic value @xmath77 .",
    "when increasing the volume from below to above @xmath83  @xmath53 , the optimization procedure tends to stay trapped at @xmath60 until at about @xmath85  @xmath53 it falls back to the curve obtained for decreasing volume .",
    "the corresponding @xmath28 calculations ( not shown here ) tell us that the range @xmath86 ( 52.1 ; 52.9 )  @xmath53 ( @xmath87 between 5.7 and 6.6  gpa ) should be considered as the region of co - existence of two @xmath0 variants , because the total energy differences are smaller than 2  mev / cell and the specific volumes are almost identical .",
    "the third @xmath0 variant is energetically favored for @xmath88  @xmath53 ( @xmath89  gpa ) . however , at these volumes the @xmath0 @xmath78 sb - ii transition ( not investigated here ) is even more favored ; the experiments @xcite situate the appearance of the latter phase at @xmath90 @xmath53 .",
    "hence , the possibility of observing that third @xmath0 variant can be ruled out .",
    "the peculiar variations of @xmath74 and @xmath79 at @xmath80  @xmath53 indicate a transition to a pseudo - cubic @xmath0 variant where only the metric approaches the cubic value ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "the symmetry of the structure remains @xmath2 .",
    "the second discontinuity appearing in @xmath79 and @xmath74 at @xmath91 = 52.1 @xmath53 suggests a transition towards a a third a7 variant where the behavior of @xmath74 and @xmath79 is reversed ; the cubic value of @xmath60 exactly , constant and independent of volume , and @xmath92 and varying .",
    "so , allowing for the two structural degrees of freedom of @xmath2 , our calculations never converged towards a stable @xmath75 structure of sb .",
    "the non - smoothness of the @xmath93 and @xmath94 variations , occurring at essentially the same two volumes as marked by vertical lines in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , was spotted in the context of comparisons of lda @xmath95 gga calculations reported in ref .. the details of the variations were not pursued throughout the `` instability region '' , and ref .",
    "concluded at a phase transition to the @xmath75 structure at @xmath96  @xmath53 ( incorrect ) , but found out that `` the axial ratio converges to @xmath97 before the parameter @xmath79 converges to @xmath98 '' ( correct ) .",
    "another , more recent , calculation @xcite concluded that the @xmath0 @xmath78 sb - ii transition takes place at @xmath99  gpa , i.e. _ before _ the ( hypothetical ) @xmath0 @xmath78 @xmath75 transformation might occur at the ( calculated ) pressure of @xmath100  gpa .",
    "apparently , non - smooth variations of the @xmath0 structure were not examined in detail in ref ..",
    "so as to estimate the uncertainties of our above procedures , we briefly compare the lda calculations with the ones performed using the gga . within that approximation a similar behavior",
    "was obtained but the `` coexistence region '' of @xmath0 variants is larger , i.e. @xmath86 ( 52.2 ; 53.8 )  @xmath53 . a sensible estimate is thus to situate the region of instabilities , which is to be compared to experiment , as the _ average _ of the two results : @xmath101  @xmath53 . using then also for the @xmath102 conversion the average of the lda- and gga - limits for @xmath29 , we obtain a lower `` critical '' pressure for the instability region as @xmath103 gpa . this is lower than the experimentally observed appearance of the sb - ii structure ( 8 to 8.5  gpa on upstroke ) .",
    "but , taking into account that the sb - i to sb - ii transition exhibits a hysteresis of about 1  gpa at room temperature @xcite , the calculated critical pressure is only slightly less than the equilibrium transition pressure ( roughly estimated as being the average pressure value for the upstroke and downstroke ) .",
    "so , there is not much room for actually finding an instability of the a7 phase preceding the sb - i to sb - ii / iv transition .    in reports on early x - ray diffraction studies performed under non - hydrostatic conditions @xcite",
    ", the authors uphold to have observed the sluggish transformation to an intermediate primitive cubic structure of antimony in the pressure interval @xmath104  gpa or at least pronounced anomalies in the evolution of the @xmath0 lattice parameters with pressure .",
    "the findings of ref . , derived from low - resolution diffraction diagrams , have not been confirmed in subsequent diffraction studies . also , based on discontinuities in the pressure variation of the electrical resistivity of sb seen at @xmath105  gpa ( upstroke ) and 6.7  gpa ( downstroke ) @xcite the existence of only one structural transition ( a7 to sb - ii ) is proposed in the interval considered here . nevertheless , the parallel between our calculated results and the experimental observations of ref .",
    "is , perhaps , not accidental .",
    "it is conceivable that , in the presence of a substantial uniaxial stress component along the @xmath7 axis , a precursor transition can be induced . in this context",
    "it should be noted that , at fixed volume , the calculations yield optimized @xmath74 ratios which are smaller than the experimental values [ cf .",
    "[ fig8](b ) ] .",
    "so , the condition of zero deviatoric stresses in the calculations corresponds to a strained configuration when compared to experimental data .",
    "with attention now being drawn to the importance of uniaxial stress , we arrive at what could be expected from intuition : the peierls - like distortion of sb - i , being a uniaxial effect , may depend sensitively on uniaxial stress along @xmath7 , with associated structural variations that are not observed under truly hydrostatic conditions .    to summarize , total energy calculations constrained to space group @xmath2 point to the possible existence of an a7 to a7 transition near the borderline where antimony transforms to the higher - pressure sb - ii / iv phases .",
    "we do not rule out other modes of instability of the @xmath0 structure that require a space group lower in symmetry ( monoclinic ) than @xmath2 .",
    "so , a more general conclusion would be that the normal @xmath0 structure of sb may exhibit a structural instability before it transforms to the sb - ii / iv phases .",
    "some tuning of the phase behavior through uniaxial stress may be possible .",
    "when comparing the calculations with experiment , an inherent uncertainty concerns the role played by a finite temperature .",
