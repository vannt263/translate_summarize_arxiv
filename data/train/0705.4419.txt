    "a lot has been learned about the pattern of neutrino masses and mixings over the past decade from atmospheric @xcite and solar @xcite neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "when these impressive results are supplemented by results from reactor @xcite-@xcite and accelerator @xcite neutrino oscillation experiments , a comprehensive picture for neutrino masses begins to emerge .",
    "a global analysis of these results gives rather precise determination of some of the oscillation parameters @xcite-@xcite : @xmath10 @xmath11 _ 13 0.2  .",
    "while these results are impressive , there are still many important unanswered questions .",
    "one issue is the sign of @xmath12 which is presently unknown .",
    "this is directly linked to nature of neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "a positive sign of @xmath13 would indicate normal hierarchy ( @xmath14 ) while a negative sign would correspond to an inverted mass hierarchy ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "another issue is the value of the leptonic mixing angle @xmath2 , which currently is only bounded from above .",
    "a third issue is whether cp is violated in neutrino oscillations , which is possible ( with @xmath16 ) if the phase angle @xmath17 in the mns matrix is non  zero .",
    "forthcoming long baseline experiments @xcite , no@xmath18a @xcite , t2k @xcite and reactor experiments double chooz and daya bay will explore some or all these fundamental questions .",
    "answers to these have the potential for revealing the underlying symmetries of nature .    while there exists in the literature a large number of theoretical models for normal neutrino mass hierarchy , such is not the case with inverted hierarchy",
    ". a large number of models for inverted hierarchy based on symmetries @xcite-@xcite that were proposed a few years ago are now excluded by the solar and kamland data , which proved that @xmath19 is significantly away from the maximal value of @xmath1 predicted by most of these models . as a result",
    ", there is a dearth of viable inverted neutrino mass hierarchy models . in this paper , we attempt to take a step towards remedying this situation .    here",
    "we suggest a class of models for inverted neutrino mass hierarchy based on @xmath20 flavor symmetry .",
    "@xmath21 is the non - abelian group generated by the permutation of three objects , while the @xmath22 is used for explaining the mass hierarchy of the leptons .",
    "this @xmath22 symmetry is naturally identified with the anomalous @xmath22 of string origin . in our construction ,",
    "the @xmath21 permutation symmetry is broken down to an approximate @xmath23 in the neutrino sector , whereas it is broken completely in the charged lepton sector .",
    "such a setup enables us to realize effectively a @xmath24 interchange symmetry in the neutrino sector ( desirable for maximal mixing in atmospheric neutrino oscillations ) , while having non - degenerate charged leptons .",
    "the @xmath22 symmetry acts as leptonic @xmath25 symmetry , which is also desirable for an inverted neutrino mass spectrum .",
    "the breaking of @xmath23 symmetry in the charged lepton sector enables us to obtain @xmath19 significantly different from @xmath1 .",
    "interestingly , we find that the amount of deviation of @xmath19 from @xmath1 is determined by @xmath2 through the relation @xmath26 when compared with the neutrino data , the relation ( [ prediction12 ] ) implies the constraints ( see fig .",
    "1 ) : _ 130.13  ,  ||0.75 ( 43^o )  . at the same time , the model gives ^2_23(1-^2_13 )  , which is very close to 1/2 .",
    "these predictions will be tested in forthcoming experiments .",
    "somewhat similar relations have been obtained in scenarios with ` quark - lepton complementarity ' @xcite-@xcite by postulating the relations @xmath27 , @xmath28 ( @xmath29 is the cabibbo angle ) . in our approach",
    "the leptonic mixing angles are inter - related by symmetries without involving the quark sector .",
    "furthermore , we are able to derive the relations ( [ prediction12])-([prediction23 ] ) from flavor symmetries ( see section [ sec : u1z3model ] ) .",
    "our models have the right ingredients to generate the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe via resonant leptogenesis .",
    "the @xmath22 symmetry which acts on leptons as @xmath25 symmetry guarantee that two right  handed neutrinos that we use for see saw mechanism are quasi - degenerate .",
    "this feature leads to a resonant enhancement in the leptonic cp asymmetry , which in turn admits low right  handed neutrino masses , as low as few tev . with such light right ",
    "handed neutrinos ( rhn ) generating lepton asymmetry , there is no cosmological gravitino problem when these models are supersymmetrized .",
    "the class of neutrino mass models and leptogenesis scenario that we present here will work well in both supersymmetric and non - supersymmetric contexts .",
    "however , since low energy susy has strong phenomenological and theoretical motivations , we shall adopt the supersymmetric framework for our explicit constructions .",
    "in order to build inverted hierarchical neutrino mass matrices which are predictive and which lead to successful neutrino oscillations , it is enough to introduce two right  handed neutrino states @xmath30 . then the superpotential relevant for neutrino masses is w_=l^ty_nh_u - n^tm_nn  , where @xmath31 denotes the up  type higgs doublet superfield , while @xmath32 and @xmath33 are @xmath34 dirac yukawa matrix and @xmath35 majorana mass matrix respectively .",
    "their structures can be completely determined by flavor symmetries . in order to have predictive models of inverted hierarchy , the @xmath36 symmetry can be used @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this symmetry naturally gives rise to large @xmath37 and maximal @xmath38 angles . at the same time",
    ", the mixing angle @xmath39 will be zero . in order to accommodate the solar neutrino oscillations ,",
    "the @xmath40-symmetry must be broken .",
    "the pattern of @xmath40-symmetry breaking will determine the relations and predictions for neutrino masses and mixings .",
    "as a starting point , in the neutrino sector let us impose @xmath41 interchange symmetry @xmath23 : @xmath42 , which will lead to maximal @xmath43 mixing , consistent with atmospheric neutrino data .",
    "the leptonic mixing angles will receive contributions from both the neutrino sector and the charged lepton sector . as an initial attempt let us assume that the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal .",

    "this is a shortcoming of the minimal scenario .",
    "below we present a possible solution to this conundrum which looks attractive and maintains predictive power without fine tuning by making use of mixing in the charged lepton sector .",

    "the @xmath179 condition gets modified and we obtain = v_t1 ,  i(1 + )  ,  with  ~_s^2  ,  where  _ s = v_s / m_pl ( with @xmath188 ) . as we see , the winding of @xmath189 is slightly changed ( with @xmath190 , i.e. @xmath191 ) .",
    "this change will not have any impact in the charged lepton sector and for the light neutrino masses and mixings .",
    "however , this will turn out to be important in shifting the right  handed neutrino mass degeneracy and therefore for resonant leptogenesis .",
    "we will use the following parametrization ~_s  ,  .",
    "these two parameters will be used in expressing hierarchies between masses and mixings of the leptons .",
    "all non - renormalizable operators that we consider in the charged lepton sector will be cut off by appropriate powers of the planck scale @xmath192 and therefore in those operators the powers of @xmath193 and @xmath194 will appear .",
    "there are also operators cut off with a different scale which can be obtained by integrating out some vector - like states with masses below @xmath192 .",
    "let us start with the charged lepton sector .",
    "for the tau lepton mass the operator _*1*^c_*1*h_d  , is relevant , where @xmath21 contraction is in the singlet @xmath161-channel .",
    "this operator can emerge by decoupling of heavy @xmath195 , @xmath196 states in @xmath161 representation of @xmath21 , as shown in the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "( [ tau - op ] ) gives @xmath197 , where @xmath198 is a mass of @xmath199 states .",
    "next , we include the following planck scale suppressed operators : ^c(+z)h_d + l_1 ^c(+z)h_d + e_1^c ^2(+z)h_d + l_1e_1^c^3(+z)h_d  .    substituting appropriate vevs in ( [ tau - op ] ) , ( [ charged - ops ] ) and taking into account that @xmath200 , for the charged lepton yukawa matrix we obtain @xmath201 which nearly has the desired structure of ( [ ye ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the @xmath202 entry of ( [ ye - derived ] ) not presented in ( [ ye ] ) does not change the predictive relations obtained in sect .",
    "[ sec : imprmodel ] .",
    "the @xmath203 and @xmath204 entries have no new parameters , and they shift relations in ( [ ye ] ) by @xmath205 .",
    "indeed , from ( [ ye - derived ] ) we conclude that 0.13 - 0.2  ,  _",
    "s~_^2   ( this provides @xmath206 , which is compatible with the observed hierarchies ) .",
    "therefore , the results of sect . [",
    "sec : imprmodel ] are robust .",
    "now we turn to the neutrino sector . with transformation properties given in table [ t:1 ] , and for integer @xmath207 , the relevant couplings have the form    cc &    cc n_1 & n_2     +    c l_1 +   +    &    (    cc &   + & + 0 &     ) h_u    ,     cc &    cc n_1 & n_2     +    c n_1 + n_2    &    (    cc    0 &  ( z+ ) +  ( z+ ) &     ) m_r    .",
    "[ ynu - mn - s3model ] @xmath208 is some cut off scale lower than @xmath192 .",
    "we have found one interesting example : for @xmath209 , and @xmath210 we obtain    ccc &    cc &     +    c +   +    y_= &    (    cc    _ s &  ^6 + & + 0 &  ^4 + & + 0 &  i^4    )    ,     cc &    cc &     +    c +   +    m_n= &    (    cc    0 &  _ s^4 + & + _ s^4 &  _ s^2 ^ 10    ) m_r       [ ynu - mn - uzmodel ] ( where we have used the property @xmath211 ) . making a rotation of @xmath45 states to set ( 1,2 ) entry of the first matrix of ( [ ynu - mn - uzmodel ] ) to zero and at the same time performing phase redefinitions we will arrive at the form of ( [ ynu - mn ] ) with m = m_r _ s^4~m_r^6 _  ,  ~_s  ,   ~^4  ,   |_n^*+_n^|~^6_s~^8 _  , and ~  ,   |_^*+_^|~  .",
    "therefore , we get the right magnitude for @xmath212 , while experimentally measured value of @xmath213 dictates @xmath214  gev . thus , from ( [ params ] ) we can estimate the absolute value of the rhn mass . for @xmath215 ( the value used for numerical studies in sect .",
    "[ sec : leptogenesis ] ) we get @xmath216  gev . this range includes the values of rhn masses such that susy gravitino problem is avoided . at the same time we get @xmath217 and @xmath218 .",
    "all these values work well for resonant leptogenesis ( see fig . [ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the model presented in this section works well for inverted neutrino mass hierarchical scenario and also insures the success of resonant leptogenesis .",
    "finally , we briefly comment on some aspects of low energy phenomenology of the presented model .",
    "the superpotential term @xmath219 is allowed by symmetries of the model , which has a potential for generating the @xmath220-term with @xmath221  tev induced after susy breaking .",
    "as far as the quark sector is concerned , the yukawa couplings @xmath222 and @xmath223 are allowed with the following @xmath22 and @xmath172 charge assignment : @xmath224 and @xmath225 .",
    "this charge assignment is flavor independent .",
    "however , if desired one can also select flavor dependent charges for understanding of hierarchies between quark masses and ckm mixings .",
    "the freedom in the selection of @xmath226 can be exploited for the simultaneous cancelation of @xmath227 and @xmath228 mixed anomalies via green - schwarz mechanism ( achieved with @xmath229 ) .",
    "also , one can verify that @xmath230 and @xmath231 anomalis are automatically zero with the above @xmath172 charge assignment .",
    "therefore , @xmath172 can be identified as a discrete gauge symmetry .",
    "one remarkable feature is that with the @xmath172 symmetry , matter parity is automatic . indeed , with the @xmath232 charge assignment",
    ", a @xmath233 subgroup of @xmath172 r - symmetry remains unbroken .",
    "therefore , @xmath172-symmetry insures that the model has realistic phenomenology with a stable lsp .",
    "in this paper we have presented a new class of models which realizes an inverted spectrum for neutrino masses .",
    "these models predict a definite correlation between neutrino mixing angles @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "deviation of @xmath38 from @xmath234 is controlled by the value of @xmath39 .",
