    "the number density of particles of some size @xmath88 is set by a balance of their creation and removal : a high abundance means these grains are created frequently and/or survive for a long time , while a low abundance means they are created sporadically and/or are removed quickly after creation . since we are effectively following single units of mass at @xmath118 , and the collision model used for the followed particles is the same as the one used in sect . [ sec : background ] , the ergodic principle states that , given enough time ( in this case , multiple coagulation / fragmentation cycles ) , the fractional time spent inside grains of size @xmath88 should be proportional to the local mass distribution .",

    "the decrease of @xmath192 is most pronounced for low values of @xmath8 , where the largest grains have settled most ( table [ tab : dustpops ] ) and the mixing timescale is longer ( eq . [ eq : t_mix ] ) .    for @xmath113 , our simulations indicate @xmath196 which appears unphysical .",
    "this is the result of increased small dust production at high @xmath64 because the collision velocity is increased with respect to the midplane ( see both panels of eq .",
    "[ fig : vels ] ) .",
    "this broadens the vertical distribution of small grains slightly , resulting in @xmath197 .",
    "this effect is much smaller in the simulations with a lower @xmath8 , where almost no destructive collisions take place at high @xmath64 because most of the mass is in the midplane .",
    "we return to a discussion of how the assumptions of our model may impact our results further below .",
    "the trapping of small particles seen here can be understood by comparing the mixing timescale to the survival time of small grains near the midplane , where they are formed . when the removal of small grains from the midplane is dominated by collisions with particles of size @xmath63 and",
    "stokes number @xmath148 , the sweep - up timescale can be written as @xmath198 where we have assumed the collision velocity @xmath199 is set by the larger particles ( see fig .",

    "[ eq : t_s ] ) and making use of @xmath202 , the particle size and material density drop out and we are left with the surprisingly simple relation @xmath203    it is interesting to compare the sweep - up timescale to the mixing time of the smallest particles @xmath80 ( eq . [ eq : t_mix ] ) .",
    "we define the ratio of these two timescales @xmath204 for @xmath205 , small grains can easily diffuse before being swept up , and we can expect to retrieve @xmath206 . alternatively ,",
    "when @xmath207 , the sweep - up time is short compared to the mixing timescale . in this limit , we expect @xmath192 to decrease and approach the scale height of the mass - dominating particles . from our simulations , we find that the transition between these regimes occurs around @xmath208 .",
    "this picture and the location of the regime boundary are consistent with the behavior seen in figs .",
    "[ fig:3d ] and [ fig : vars ] .    finally , it is useful to construct a function that recreates this behavior and provides the scale height of small ( @xmath209 particles .",
    "we find that @xmath210 with @xmath211 the relative scale - height of particles with @xmath212 ( the largest of the small particles ) and @xmath213 the relative scale height of the mass - dominating particles ( listed in table [ tab : dustpops ] ) works well in most cases . in figure [ fig : hd_small ] , the predictions of eq .",
    "[ eq : fit ] are plotted alongside with the results from our simulation .",
    "fitting eq .",
    "[ eq : fit ] to these results suggests @xmath214 for @xmath215 and @xmath216 for more turbulent cases .",
    "a key assumption that is made in this study is that the background dust population is well - described by a growth / fragmentation steady state distribution as described by @xcite ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : background ] ) .",
    "this implies that the maximum particle size is set by turbulence - induced fragmentation . for this to be the case",
    ", the relative collision velocity should exceed the fragmentation threshold , i.e. , @xmath217 .",
    "this is usually achieved in the inner disk , where @xmath218 is higher .",
    "in addition , bare silicate grains inside the snow - line have a significantly lower fragmentation threshold than their icy cousins in the outer disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "second , growth to sizes @xmath219 has to be able to proceed unhindered by effects such as bouncing or radial drift .",
    "the latter is often problematic in the outer disk , where particles drift radially before reaching @xmath46 , resulting in a maximum size that can be significantly smaller @xcite .",
    "even when growth up to @xmath46 is possible , the most massive particles will drift radially and the local dust surface density will typically decrease .",
    "the time - scale on which this occurs depends on the stokes numbers of the largest particles , and can be estimated for the calculations presented here .",
    "the last two columns of table [ tab : dustpops ] show @xmath80 and @xmath220 ( see appendix [ sec : lifetime ] ) . while a stronger turbulence decreases the mixing time , it increases the drift timescale because the maximum particle size and corresponding stokes number are lower ( e.g. , eq . [ eq : s_max ] ) . in all cases considered here , @xmath221 except for @xmath215 where the timescales are comparable .",
    "thus , the simulations presented in this work are probably most relevant for the inner parts of protoplanetary disks , where growth and mixing are fast , collision velocities are high , and the fragmentation threshold is lower .",
    "lastly , throughout this work we have assumed that the largest particles are always in the epstein drag regime . in the very inner disk , or for very porous aggregates , this might not always be true . in those cases ,",
    "the stokes drag regime applies , in which the stopping time is increased by a factor @xmath222 @xcite . inserting this factor in eq .",
    "[ eq : t_sw_1 ] results in a _ shorter _ sweep - up time ( by a factor @xmath223 ) , making collisional trapping more effective .",
    "a smaller scale height for the smallest dust particles has a major impact on their number density in the upper disk atmosphere .",
    "the expected local small - dust - to - gas ratio at a height @xmath64 can be written as @xmath224 with @xmath225 the scale - height of the small dust and @xmath150 the fraction of the size - distribution residing in small grains ( see table [ tab : dustpops ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : smalldust ] shows the dust - to - gas ratio at @xmath226 as a function of the total vertically - integrated dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "the dotted lines show the predictions for the cases where small grains are always well - mixed and @xmath227 .",
    "differences here are because of different values of @xmath150 .",
    "the solid lines show predictions for when collisional trapping taken into account by using eq .",
    "[ eq : fit ] , using @xmath228 and @xmath229 .",
    "the turn - over of these curves is interesting and perhaps counter - intuitive : while adding more dust to the column is still increasing the _ total _ amount of small dust ( i.e. , we keep @xmath150 constant ) , it is also increasing the degree of collisional trapping and thus lowering @xmath192 . since the local number density scales exponentially with the square the relative scale - height , the latter effect is strongest and the net amount of small dust in the upper atmosphere decreases .      in this work",
    "we have assumed that the vertically integrated dust distribution is given by the fit function of @xcite ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : background ] ) .",
    "however , that approach in turn assumes that dust particles are at all times distributed vertically according to eq .",
    "[ eq : h_d ] .",
    "when @xmath207 , our models show significant deviations from this pure mixing / diffusion equilibrium and this is expected to impact the size - distribution itself .",
    "for example , if small grains are confined to the midplane , their collision rate with large particles will increase , probably reducing their overall abundance .",
    "the greater density of solids at the disk midplane will likely lead to more frequent growth than assumed here , and thus our conclusions would be strengthened .",
    "ideally one would calculate the background distribution self - consistently .",
    "@xcite accomplished this by stacking a series of boxes on top of each other , using the representative monte carlo model of @xcite to simulate particle coagulation in each box individually , and allowing dust grains to move between adjacent boxes . focusing on small grains , @xcite conclude that `` high values of turbulence are needed to explain why disk atmospheres are dusty for @xmath230 '' .",
    "while it is difficult to compare our results directly , mainly because @xcite used a more complex model for the collisional outcomes @xcite and porosity evolution @xcite , our findings are in agreement with their conclusion and , based on the results presented here , we can offer a second possibility , namely low values of @xmath52 that allow small grains to diffuse more freely .",
    "such conditions may be realized as solids are depleted by radial drift or as much of the mass gets locked up in planetesimals , unable to take part in the collisional evolution considered here .",
    "while solving the size - distribution in a self - consistent manner is beyond the scope of this work , we can use the framework of @xcite to estimate what the size - distribution would look like if all grain sizes have the same scale - height ( see appendix [ sec : nama_diff ] ) . from fig .",
    "[ fig : nama_diff ] we see that collisional trapping will indeed reduce the overall abundance of small grains .",
    "the differences between the trapped and non - trapped distributions can be a factor of a few and largest for weak turbulence , where @xmath61 and @xmath46 differ by several orders of magnitude .",
    "finally , we should discuss inferences that might be made from _ not _ seeing any dust trapping , i.e. , witnessing significant amounts of small dust high in the disk atmosphere . in the context of eq .",
    "[ eq : fit ] , two things could be happening .",
    "first , if the largest bodies in the size distribution do not experience strong settling ( i.e. , @xmath231 in eq .",
    "[ eq : fit ] ) , the trapping is not effective .",
    "this happens when @xmath232 , which can occur either because fragmentation limits growth too early ( specifically , when @xmath233 ) , or when growth is limited by radial drift ( sect .",
    "[ sec : validity ] ) .",
    "second , a high value of @xmath234 indicates small grains can move relatively unhindered by collisions , irrespective of whether the large grains have settled or not . for the turbulence strengths considered here , @xmath235 did not see any trapping ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : hd_small ] ) . for typical initial dust - to - gas ratios of @xmath236 , this means a reduction of at least one order of magnitude , which could point towards a decrease in the overall dust content caused by radial drift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or perhaps indicate that a substantial portion of the dust mass has been converted into planetesimals and no longer takes part in the collisional cascade ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "finally , the observed small particles might not come from the midplane , but be replenished from outside the disk @xcite .",
    "this would suggest no genetic relationship between the dust observed at the disk surface and that which is accreted into planetesimal at disk midplane .",
    "the protoplanetary disk around tw hya could be an interesting environment to look for observational signatures of collisional dust trapping . first , there exist independent measurements for the dust mass through ( sub)-mm observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the gas mass through rotational hd lines @xcite , which allow us to constrain @xmath52 . moreover , there are direct and indirect constraints on the strength of the turbulence @xcite . for the inner disk ( the region around @xmath237 )",
    ", @xcite argue that the dust population is fragmentation - limited by comparing the inferred radial profile of the dust surface density to the theoretical models of @xcite . for the outer disk",
    ", several studies have found that the upper layers of the disk s atmosphere are significantly depleted in c and o @xcite .",
    "a potential explanation put forward by both groups is that these species have been locked up inside large , settled grains , and are not efficiently being mixed back up .",
    "the vapor in the atmosphere can be replenished by small grains diffusing upward ( small grains are the prime carriers because of their high surface - to - mass ratio ) .",
    "thus , when even the smallest grains can not easily return to the atmosphere , as shown in our simulations , the depletion of volatiles from the atmosphere could be very efficient .",
    "while the simulations in this work are not directly applicable to the outer disk ( radial drift is expected to play a major role in these parts of the disk ) , similar modeling can be used to study the impact of dust dynamics on the volatile budget .",
    "the next step in modeling such a system would be to expand the approach developed here with a description of freeze - out and sublimation of important volatile species and study the distribution of gas and dust in time simultaneously .",
    "in low temperature high density regions like the midplane gas molecules will freeze - out onto dust grains , while the molecules are expected to desorb and return to the gas phase in the warmer disk atmosphere ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "simulating the interplay between these processes , while solving the dust size - distribution in the presence of radial drift self - consistently , will be the subject of future work .",
    "we have modeled the vertical diffusion and settling behavior of dust grains in a single column of gas in a protoplanetary disk while taking into account sticking and destructive collisions .",
    "we assume that the local size distribution is in a growth - fragmentation equilibrium and that radial drift is not an important factor over the @xmath238 that we consider .",
    "our models indicate that :    1 .",
    "contrary to what is usually assumed , small ( sub)micron grains are not necessarily well - mixed with the gas , but can become trapped in a layer that is significantly thinner .",
    "2 .   collisional trapping occurs when the time - scale on which small particles are swept up by larger grains is much shorter than the mixing timescale ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vars ] ) . for the steady - state dust populations of sect .",
    "[ sec : background ] , this occurs when @xmath239 .",
    "the scale - height of the small grains ( those with stokes numbers @xmath240 ) ranges from @xmath241 ( no trapping ) to close to the scale - height of the mass - dominating particles ( efficient trapping ) and is accurately described by eq .",
    "[ eq : fit ] with @xmath242 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : hd_small ] ) 4 .",
    "a reduced scale - height for small dust grains has a large impact on the local dust abundance in the disk atmosphere .",
    "since collisional trapping is more efficient for high @xmath52 , this leads to the counter - intuitive behavior where _ increasing _ the column s dust content _ decreases _ the amount of small dust at high @xmath64 ( fig .",
