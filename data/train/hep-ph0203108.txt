    "phenomenology one usually classifies neutralinos as gaugino - like ( with @xmath12 ) , higgsino - like ( with @xmath13 ) , and mixed , where ( gaugino ) purity is defined as @xmath14 .    in most approaches",
    "the lsp is stable due to r - parity conservation @xcite .",
    "the neutralino , being massive , neutral and stable , often provides a sizeable contribution to the relic density .",
    "the contribution of neutralinos to the relic density is strongly model - dependent and varies by several orders of magnitude over the whole allowed parameter space of the mssm .",
    "the neutralino relic density then can impose stringent constraints on the parameters of the mssm and the susy particle spectrum , and may have important consequences both for studies of susy at colliders and in astroparticle experiments @xcite . in light of this and",
    "taking into account the continuing improvements in determining the abundance of cdm , and other components of the universe , which have now reached an unprecedented precision @xcite , one needs to be able to perform an accurate enough computation of the wimp relic abundance , which would allow for a reliable comparison between theory and observation .    in the early universe neutralinos existed in thermal equilibrium with the cosmic thermal plasma . as the universe expanded and cooled , the thermal energy is no longer sufficient to produce neutralinos at an appreciable rate , they decouple and their number density scales with co - moving volume .",
    "the sparticles significantly heavier than the lsp decouple at the earlier time and decay into lsps before the lsps decouple themselves .",
    "nevertheless there may exist some other next - to - lightest sparticles ( nlsps ) which are not much heavier than the stable lsp .",
    "the number densities of the nlsps have only slight boltzmann suppressions with respect to the lsp number density when the lsp freezes out of chemical equilibrium with the thermal bath",
    ". therefore they may still be present in the thermal plasma , and nlsp - lsp and nlsp - nlsp interactions hold lsp in thermal equilibrium resulting with significant reduction of the lsp number density and leading to acceptable values even with a rather heavy sparticle spectrum @xcite .",
    "these coannihilation processes can be particularly important when the lsp - lsp annihilation rate itself is suppressed .",
    "the number density is governed by the boltzmann equation @xcite @xmath15 with @xmath16 either being the lsp number density if there are no other coannihilating sparticles , or the sum over the number densities of all coannihilation partners . the index `` eq '' denotes the corresponding equilibrium value . to solve the boltzmann equation ( [ boltzmann ] )",
    "one needs to evaluate the thermally averaged neutralino annihilation cross section @xmath17 . without coannihilation processes @xmath17 is given as the thermal average of the lsp annihilation cross - section @xmath18 times relative velocity @xmath19 of the annihilating lsps @xmath20 otherwise , it is determined as @xmath21 , where the effective thermally averaged cross - section is obtained by summation over coannihilating particles @xcite @xmath22 if @xmath23 denotes the nowadays number density of the relics , the relic density is given by @xmath24    many increasingly sophisticated calculations of the relic density of neutralinos in supersymmetric models , with various approximations both in the evaluation of @xmath25 and in solving the boltzmann equation were performed .",
    "following @xcite we briefly remind below of the major developments in the field .    perhaps for the first time strong constraints for pure photino relic abundance",
    "were obtained in @xcite .",
    "the first analysis of the general neutralino case was performed in @xcite .",
    "several other early papers subsequently appeared with more detailed and elaborate analyses .",
    "the two - neutralino annihilation into the ordinary fermion - antifermion ( @xmath26 ) final states through the @xmath27-exchange was computed in detail @xcite .",
    "the first complete analysis of the neutralino annihilation into @xmath28 , @xmath29 and higgs - pair final states was performed in @xcite . the higgs contribution into neutralino annihilation",
    "was first computed in @xcite . for the pure gaugino - like and higgsino - like neutralinos ( where several important resonances and final states are absent )",
    "all the annihilation channels were considered in @xcite . a first complete set of expressions for the product of the cross section times velocity using the helicity amplitude technique",
    "was computed in @xcite .",
    "the relic density calculation was made by expanding the @xmath30 as a power series in neutralino velocity .",
    "the angular and energy integrals in such a case can be evaluated analytically and the remaining integration over temperature was performed numerically . when expanded in the nonrelativistic limit ,",
    "these give expressions for the first two coefficients of the partial wave expansion . in the early papers",
    "the partial wave expansion of the @xmath30 was used in most cases .",
    "the method is normally expected to give an accurate enough approximation in many regions of the model parameter space because the relic neutralino velocity is expected to be highly non - relativistic .",
    "however , it fails near @xmath31-channel resonances ( quite high - energetic ) and thresholds for new final states , as was first pointed out in @xcite and further emphasized in @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was shown @xcite that due to the very narrow width of the lightest supersymmetric higgs @xmath32 , in the vicinity of its @xmath31-channel exchange the error can be as large as a few orders of magnitude .",
    "therefore a relativistic treatment of thermal averaging is necessary .",
    "a recent detailed analysis @xcite showed that in the case of the often wide @xmath31-channel resonance exchange of the pseudoscalar higgs boson @xmath33 , the expansion produces a significant error @xcite .",
    "furthermore subdominant channels and often neglected interference terms can also sometimes play a sizeable role .",
    "the proper formalism for relativistic thermal averaging was developed in @xcite , and used in @xcite .",
    "a more accurate treatment of the heat bath for both annihilating particles involving two separate thermal distributions was considered in @xcite .",
    "a very useful compact expression for @xmath30 as a single integral over the cross section was for the first time derived in @xcite .",
    "the darksusy code where the relic density of neutralinos is numerically computed without the partial wave expansion approximation was developed in @xcite .",
    "an additional very strong reduction of the relic abundance of wimps through coannihilation was first discovered in @xcite .",
    "there are regions in the mssm parameter space where higgsino - like lsp , light chargino and next - to - lightest neutralino masses become nearly degenerate and all three species can exist in thermal equilibrium .",
    "their mutual coannihilation is often important , and even dominant @xcite . in the coannihilation with the lsp",
    "can be involved any susy particle , provided its mass is almost degenerate with the mass of the lsp @xcite . in the low - energy effective mssm ( effmssm ) , where one ignores restriction from unification assumptions and investigates the mssm parameter space at the weak scale @xcite there is , in principle , no preference for the next - to - lightest susy particle .",
    "nevertheless due to quite reasonable and commonly used sets of free parameters , when all gaugino mass eigenvalues are calculated in terms of entries of gaugino mass matrices ( @xmath34 ) , the coannihilations between gauginos are expected to occur most often , in the effmssm @xcite .",
    "the relativistic thermal averaging formalism @xcite was extended to include coannihilation processes in @xcite , and was implemented in the darksusy code @xcite for coannihilation of charginos and heavier neutralinos . in",
    "was found @xcite that for higgsino - like lsp such a coannihilation significantly decreases the relic density and rules out these lsps from the region of cosmological interest .",
    "for the highly bino - like lsps , the reduction of the relic density due to the coannihilation is not strong enough to avoid an overclosing of the universe .",
    "the importance of the neutralino coannihilation with sferminos was emphasized and investigated both for sleptons @xcite or stops @xcite and sbottoms @xcite in the so - called constrained mssm ( cmssm ) @xcite or in supergravity ( msugra ) models @xcite .    in the most popular msugra model",
    "@xcite susy breaking occurs in a hidden sector and is communicated to observable sectors via gravitational interactions .",
    "the model has a minimal set of parameters : @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the universal scalar mass , @xmath37 is the universal gaugino mass and @xmath38 is the universal trilinear mass , all evaluated at @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the ratio of higgs field vacuum expectation values and @xmath41 is a higgs parameter of the superpotential . in particular , within the framework of the msugra , it was found @xcite that at large @xmath40 , indeed large new regions of model parameter space gave rise to reasonable values for the cdm relic density , due to off - resonance neutralino annihilation through the broad @xmath33 and @xmath42 higgs resonances .",
    "there are strong correlations of sfermion , higgs boson and gaugino masses in msugra originating from unification assumptions . in regions of msugra parameter space",
    "where @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( or other sleptons ) were nearly degenerate ( at low @xmath36 ) , coannihilations could give rise to reasonable values of the relic density even at very large values of @xmath37 , at both low and high @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "in addition , for large values of the parameter @xmath38 or for non - universal scalar masses , top or bottom squark masses could become nearly degenerate with the @xmath43 , so that squark coannihilation processes can become important as well @xcite . therefore due to slepton and squark coannihilation effects , the relic density can reach the cosmologically interesting range of @xmath45 @xcite . in the msugra lsp",
    "is naturally almost pure bino - like as was first noticed in @xcite from the point of view of low - energy susy and cdm .",
    "having in mind investigation of future prospects for direct and indirect detection of lsps we follow the most phenomenological ( general ) view , not bounded by theoretical restrictions from sfermion / gaugino / higgs mass unifications , etc . to this end",
    "we need maximally general and accurate calculations of the relic density within the low - energy effective mssm scheme ( effmssm ) @xcite .",
    "the only available high - level tools for these calculations was the darksusy code ( the best code to our knowledge at the moment , this paper was started ) .",
    "unfortunately the code calculates only neutralino with neutralino / chargino coannihilations ( ncc ) , which is not sufficient in the case of bino - like lsps , when neutralino - slepton coannihilation ( slc ) and neutralino - squark coannihilation are claimed to be dominant .",
    "this paper is aimed at a comparative study of ncc and slc channels , exploration of relevant changes in the relic density and investigation of their consequences for detection of cold dark matter particles in the effmssm .",

    "the calculations of the neutralino - nucleon cross sections , and direct and indirect detection rates follow the description given in @xcite .",
    "we have evaluated the relic density of the lsp under ignoring of any coannihilation ( igc ) , taking into account only ncc or slc separately , as well as including both coannihilation channels ( bcc ) . to this end in our former code @xcite darksusy procedures of @xmath25 evaluation and solution of boltzmann equation",
    "were implemented .",

    "we calculated @xmath25 and @xmath62 following the relevant darksusy routines @xcite , which we have merged with code @xcite in a way that guarantees the correct inclusion of slc .    if all sleptons , neutralinos and charginos in question are substantially heavier than the lsp ( @xmath63 ) and no way for coannihilations , the resulting relic density @xmath64 is equal to @xmath65 of former results obtained without any coannihilations ( with @xmath66 ) . when at least one of coannihilation channels ( ncc or slc ) is indeed relevant , the @xmath67 ( ignorance of any coannihilation ) is calculated with @xmath68 where @xmath69 includes _ all _  open coannihilation channels .",

    "<S> within the low - energy effective minimal supersymmetric extension of standard model ( effmssm ) we calculated the neutralino relic density taking into account slepton - neutralino and neutralino - chargino / neutralino coannihilation channels . </S>",
    "<S> we performed comparative study of these channels and obtained that both of them give sizable contributions to the reduction of the relic density . due to these coannihilation processes some models ( mostly with large neutralino masses ) enter into the cosmologically interesting region for relic density , but other models leave this region . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , in general , the predictions for direct and indirect dark matter detection rates are not strongly affected by these coannihilation channels in the effmssm . </S>"
