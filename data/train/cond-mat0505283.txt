    "a long flexible elastic string , to be called a polymer , has several features of a critical system , showing power law behaviours without much fine tuning @xcite .",
    "an important quantity for a polymer is its size or the spatial extent as the length @xmath0 becomes large . for a translationally invariant system with one end ( @xmath1 ) fixed at origin ,",
    "the average position at @xmath2 is zero but the size is given by the rms value@xmath3 with @xmath4 , for the free case .",
    "similar power laws can be defined in other properties also . in general , such exponentslike the size exponent",
    "@xmath5 define the polymer universality classand these depend only on a few basic elements of the polymer .",
    "in addition to the geometric properties , the usual thermodynamic quantities , e.g. free energy ( or energy at temperature @xmath6 ) , entropy etc . , are also important , especially if one wants to study phase transitions .",
    "power lawsgenerally imply absence of any length scale in the problem .",
    "given a microscopic hamiltonian with its own small length scales like the bond length , interaction range etc , power laws occur only in the long distance limit ( large @xmath0 ) for thermally averaged quantities which require summing over all possible configurations . as a result , in the long distance limit , these power laws become insensitive to minute details at the microscopic level , a feature that may be exploited to choose appropriate simplified models to describe a polymer .    in thermal equilibrium ,",
    "the boltzmann distributionultimately determines the macroscopic behaviour . in most cases",
    "one may avoid the issue of probability distributionbut instead may concentrate only on the first few , may be the first two , moments or cumulants .",
    "for example , one needs to know the average energy , entropy etc and the various response functions which come from the width of the distribution.thermodynamic descriptions do not generally go beyond that .    in random physical systems , one encounters an extra problem",
    ". if the randomness is not thermalizable ( `` quenched''),any quantity of interest becomes realization dependent . as a result , an additional disorder averaginghas to be done over and above the usual thermal averaging for each realization .",
    "it is therefore necessary to know if and how this extra averaging alters the behaviour of the system .",
    "critical - like systems @xcite become a natural choice for studying the effect of quenched randomness because it is hoped that at least some of the properties would be insensitive to the minute details of the randomness .",
    "since for a critical system , the influence of the randomness on a long scale is what matters , it transpires that the critical behaviour will be affected if the disorder is a relevant variable . in the renormalization group language ,",
    "a coupling is classified as _ relevant , irrelevant or marginal _ , if , with increasing length scale , it grows , decays or remains invariant , because the contribution of a relevant quantity can not be ignored at long distances even if it is numerically small to start with .    with relevant disorder",
    ", there is the obvious possibility of a change in the critical properties ( e.g. new set of critical exponents ) .",
    "more complex situations may include emergence of new or extra length scales .",
    "one may recall that approach to criticality , most often , is described by a diverging length scale . developing a description of the system in terms of this large length scale only goes by the name of _ scaling _ theory .",
    "emergence of any new or extra length scale would then alter the corresponding scaling description . in case",
    "it is possible to change the nature of disorder from relevant to irrelevant ( say by changing temperature ) , then a phase transition would occur which will have no counterpart in the pure problem .",
    "for the disorder - dominated phase , on a large scale , there are possibilities of rare events ( see appendix [ app : typ ] ) which necessitates a distinction between the average value and the typical ( e.g. most probable ) value . in such situations",
    "higher moments of the quantity concerned become important .",

    "directed polymersplayed a very crucial role .",

    "[ fig:1 ] , this is a polymer which is directed in one particular direction . hence the name directed polymer @xcite .    for a directed polymer , the size would now refer to the size in the transverse @xmath12-directions and so eq . ( [ eq:9 ] ) refers to the transverse size as the length in the special @xmath7-direction increases for long enough chains , it is this size that matters and enters the scaling description .",
    "the significance of directed polymer lies in the fact that the pure system is very well understood and exactly solvable in all dimensions while the random problem can be attacked in several different ways , a luxury not affordable in most situations .",
    "two types of randomness can arise in the context of directed polymers .",
    "one type would involve imposition of a random external potential ( random medium problem ) . in the second type ,",
