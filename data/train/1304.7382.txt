    "in the framework of chiral effective field theory ( cheft ) , weinberg s original power counting ( wpc )  @xcite for nucleon - nucleon scattering requires that at leading order ( lo ) in the @xmath3 channel a constant contact interaction and one - pion exchange ( ope ) be fully iterated .",
    "however , a large discrepancy exists between the resulting eft lo  @xcite and partial - wave analysis ( pwa ) by , say , the nijmegen group  @xcite , suggesting rather slow convergence of cheft expansion .",
    "one possibility is that there may exist an unexpected infrared mass scale due to fine tuning of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) such that momentum ( or energy ) dependence must be somehow incorporated into the lo short - range interaction , as opposed to wpc  @xcite .",
    "reference  @xcite showed that such an infrared mass scale can be manifested by the inverse _ generalized _ effective range in the modified effective range expansion ( ere ) for @xmath3 ( to be defined model - independently in the paper ) , @xmath4 mev , whereas its natural value would have been around the breakdown scale of cheft : @xmath5 mev with @xmath6 being the mass of the @xmath7 meson .",
    "this fine tuning requires resummation of @xmath8 to all orders , where @xmath9 is the magnitude of the center - of - mass ( cm ) momentum .",
    "the large value of the @xmath3 scattering length , defined by the regular ere near threshold , is yet another , albeit much better known , fine tuning of qcd  @xcite .",
    "the two fine tunings do not seem to be correlated though , since @xmath10 has more to do with the energy or momentum dependence of short - range forces while @xmath11 is closely related to the constant part . originally designed to deal with the fine tuning of @xmath11 , the machinery of ref .",
    "@xcite , interestingly , facilitates resummation of @xmath8 to all orders : introduce an auxiliary field , called a dibaryon field and denoted by @xmath12 , that has the same set of quantum numbers as the @xmath3 partial wave ( baryon number 2 , parity even , spin 0 , and isospin 1 ) and the @xmath13-channel exchange of @xmath12 will bring the desired energy dependence to the lo potential .",
    "it is my goal to show in this paper how this machinery can be generalized to include systematically higher - order corrections , in particular , those of irreducible two - pion exchanges ( tpes ) .",
    "this is part of our efforts  @xcite to modify wpc and build a consistent and efficient power counting for chiral nuclear forces .",
    "this goes beyond those works that modify wpc in order to respect renormalization group ( rg ) invariance  @xcite , in which fine tuning of momentum - dependent @xmath3 counterterms were not particularly considered .",
    "however , the findings of refs .",
    "@xcite make the fine tuning of @xmath10 appear less surprising than it would for wpc : in the natural chiral system rg invariance would require that the momentum dependence of @xmath3 counterterms arise as @xmath14 correction to lo , as opposed to the underestimation of @xmath15 by wpc",
    ".    another line of investigation on applying the dibaryon fields to chiral nuclear forces can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite , in which the dibaryon fields are used for both @xmath3 and @xmath16 whereas only the spin-0 dibaryon is employed in my approach .",
    "in addition , the central yukawa part of ope [ see eq .  ] is treated as a perturbation in these works along the line of so - called ksw counting  @xcite , whereas ope is considered nonperturbative in this work [ see the discussion below eq .  ] .    for the notation to be more compatible with the literature ,",
    "i depart from the convention adopted in our previous papers  @xcite and denote the order of eft amplitudes by their absolute size rather than their relative size compared to lo .",
    "therefore , nonperturbative lo will be labeled in the paper as @xmath17 , which is the scaling for any nonperturbative , nonrelativistic scattering amplitudes , @xmath14 corrections to lo as @xmath18 , and so on .",
    "note that the wpc lo of @xmath3 has actually another issue , which is not directly related to the aforementioned slow convergence : wpc fails to prescribe a quark - mass dependent counterterm at lo which is , however , required by rg invariance  @xcite . as a by - product of the technique discussed in this paper to tackle the slow convergence ,",
    "the quark - mass issue is solved altogether .",
    "i review in sec .",
    "[ sec_lo ] the theory without fine tuning and introduce the unnaturally large , generalized effective range .",
    "i then show in sec .",
    "[ sec_dibaryon ] how this fine tuning can be incorporated by utilizing the dibaryon field , and then demonstrate the corresponding power counting up to @xmath2 where the leading tpe needs to be accounted for .",
    "finally a summary is offered in sec .",
    "[ sec_conclusion ] .",
    "to motivate the employment of the dibaryon field , i briefly review the original theory that does not include it .",
    "since most of the points to be shown here were already made in the literature , the main function of this section is to establish the notation .",
    "the leading lagrangian terms concerning the @xmath3 channel of @xmath1 scattering are  @xcite @xmath19 + \\cdots \\ , , \\end{split } \\label{eqn_philesslag}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 mev , @xmath21 , @xmath22 mev , @xmath23 mev , and @xmath24 is the spin - isospin projector for the @xmath3 channel : @xmath25 the quark - mass term proportional to @xmath26 is written in the so - called stereographic coordinates for @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "not only does it bring @xmath28 dependence to the contact interactions but it produces a nonderivative @xmath29 vertex .    the leading @xmath3 amplitude by wpc is resummation of ope and a constant @xmath3 counterterm to all orders : @xmath30 where the yukawa potential and @xmath31 are defined as @xmath32 here @xmath33 , with @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) being the outgoing ( incoming ) momentum in the cm frame , and @xmath36 . if @xmath37 is chosen to be an ultraviolet ( uv ) mass scale , the resulting power counting is ksw .",
    "this is especially plausible if the degrees of freedom of the delta - isobar are integrated out , and hence the delta - nucleon mass splitting @xmath38 mev becomes the breakdown scale .",
    "however , i choose to work in a more general scenario that keeps open the possibility of incorporating the delta - isobar , that is , @xmath37 is considered an infrared mass scale in the paper : @xmath39 .",
    "in addition , this allows for exploring situations where @xmath28 becomes so large that @xmath40 .",
    "the lo @xmath3 amplitude can be written as  @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the fully nonperturbative iteration of @xmath43 and @xmath44 with @xmath45 being the cm energy .",
    "shown diagrammatically in fig .",
    "[ fig_chiik ] , the expansions of @xmath46 and @xmath47 in powers of @xmath43 suggest that @xmath48 is finite while @xmath47 has divergences @xmath49 $ ] , where @xmath50 is the uv momentum cutoff , @xmath51 is an infrared renormalization scale , and @xmath52 are numerical factors depending on the form of the regulator .     and @xmath47 .",
    "here the solid ( dashed ) lines represent the nucleon ( pion ) propagator , and the crossed circles represent no interactions .",
    "[ fig_chiik ] ]    the divergent @xmath28 dependence of @xmath47 immediately calls wpc into question : chiral - invariant @xmath53 can not absorb such a chiral - symmetry breaking divergence  @xcite .",
    "( this is not entirely an academic issue that concerns only extrapolating lattice qcd results to the physical point of @xmath54 .",
    "as mentioned below lagrangian  , the @xmath28 divergence is related through chiral symmetry to one of the nonderivative @xmath55 vertices , which may have phenomenological impacts . )",
    "in addition to the obvious workaround that is ksw counting , it was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite that promoting to lo the operator proportional to @xmath56 replacing @xmath53 with @xmath57 in eq .",
    " will renormalize the @xmath28 divergence of @xmath47 .",
    "this is quite a striking statement because it is not immediately clear how @xmath57 , as a fractional function of @xmath28 , can absorb a divergence proportional to @xmath28 .",
    "as we see , the dibaryon field can resolve this issue in a more transparent way by allowing its mass to be renormalized by iterations of @xmath43 .",
    "although important , the short - range structure related to quark masses does not change the form of the @xmath3 amplitude as a function of the cm momentum and , hence , does not help resolve the other issue at lo which is more phenomenologically urgent , namely , the slow convergence of eft expansion in comparison to pwa .",
    "thus , for simplicity in the qualitative discussion of the convergence issue , i allow @xmath31 to have nontrivial @xmath28 dependence before we proceed to serious calculations . with this caveat , one can use @xmath53 to cancel both divergences of @xmath47 and writes on - shell @xmath58 as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the @xmath51 dependent , finite part of @xmath47  @xcite . after fitting to the pwa",
    ", one immediately observes the slow convergence that is manifested by the rather large discrepancy between @xmath58 and the pwa at low energies ( see , e.g. , fig .  2 of ref .",
    "for instance , the lo eft predicts @xmath61 for @xmath62 , whereas the nijmegen pwa gives @xmath63 .",
    "however , the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) eft curve fits the pwa well , which means that the nlo amplitude , @xmath64 , is unexpectedly enhanced .",
    "before any fine tuning is considered , the rg - invariant chiral theory for @xmath3 requires that ( renormalized ) contact coupling constants @xmath31 and @xmath65 scale as follows  @xcite : @xmath66 and hence the @xmath14 correction to lo is @xmath67 to see more easily how @xmath31 and @xmath65 are linked to the phase shifts , i recast @xmath68 in the form of the modified ere , @xmath69\\ , , \\label{eqn_dibaryonless_ere}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 unlike @xmath71 , which depends on the renormalization scale , @xmath10 is well defined and its value can be extracted from the phase shifts  @xcite : @xmath72 the fact that @xmath73 mev signals that the data do not faithfully support the proposed scaling for @xmath74 in eq .   the only avenue through which @xmath75 could have suppressed @xmath64 . to accommodate the empirical fact @xmath76",
    ", we need to develop a new scheme in which the ratios @xmath77 are resummed to all orders so that @xmath78 appears in the new lo amplitude rather than as a subleading correction .",
    "the regular @xmath3 scattering length , defined as the zero - energy value of the amplitude , is also unnaturally large : @xmath79fm , compared with its would - be natural value of @xmath80 fm .",
    "it is tempting to consolidate the two fine tunings and to argue that they come from the same source , but cheft will not be able to do this because at @xmath81 where @xmath82 is defined , @xmath78 does not contribute .",
    "in other words , as far as cheft is concerned , dialing @xmath10 does not seem to have any effects on @xmath82 .    promoting nothing but",
    "@xmath65 to lo seems an obvious way to achieve the resummation of @xmath83 .",
    "this was indeed proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite and was numerically shown to work well for a range of cutoffs  @xcite . by arranging some sophisticated runnings for @xmath31 and @xmath65 , ref .",
    "@xcite claimed that one can obtain analytically a renormalized lo amplitude .",
    "but ref .",
    "@xcite argued that iterating both @xmath31 and @xmath65 with different regularization schemes will lead to different results and that with a cutoff regulator the effective range allowed by the theory can not be freely chosen the so - called wigner bound  @xcite .",
    "so it is still unclear whether one can promote @xmath65 alone without sacrificing rg invariance .",
    "in addition to the aforementioned technical difficulty in renormalization , it would be quite surprising if fine tuning of @xmath65 can be isolated without contaminating operators with four or more derivatives .",
    "this is because multiple insertions of lower - order counterterms will generally renormalize higher - order ones through loops . before fine tuning",
    "is considered , values of @xmath84 the coefficient of the @xmath3 four - nucleon operator with @xmath85 derivatives are loosely correlated by @xmath86 and @xmath75 , through dimensionless coefficients , @xmath87 , that are undetermined but are @xmath80  @xcite : @xmath88 ( note that ref .",
    "@xcite proposed different scalings for @xmath84 ; hence , a different type of correlation ensues . ) @xmath89 being tuned towards larger values while @xmath90 remains fixed effectively lowers @xmath75 , and such change of @xmath75 propagates to @xmath84 with @xmath91 .",
    "now i recklessly assume that the above correlation is still pertinent even when @xmath92 are tuned to be so large that @xmath75 is to be replaced by @xmath86 in eq .  .",
    "it then becomes apparent that all of @xmath84 will be equally important .",
    "but an eft with infinitely many unknown parameters at lo is not meaningful , unless we impose a stronger correlation among @xmath87 such that @xmath84 are determined by a finite number of lo parameters .",
    "consider the following correlation of @xmath84 by two parameters at lo , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , @xmath95 at tree level @xmath96 , the sum of all @xmath97 is @xmath98\\ , .",

    "@xcite and to be reiterated in the next section , the @xmath13-channel @xmath12 exchange will bring about the desired lo amplitude in the form of eq .",
    ", which is the ultimate justification for me to have chosen such a correlation as eq .  .",
    "the first few lagrangian terms involving @xmath12 are  @xcite @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the covariant derivative for an isovector field : @xmath107 here i have normalized @xmath12 so that @xmath101 . later we see that fitting to the pwa results in @xmath108 .",
    "the @xmath109 term are chiral - symmetry breaking and , as shown later , it needs to be at lo because of the fully iterated yukawa potential .",
    "terms that do not explicitly involve @xmath12 but are needed in the paper are already shown in lagrangian  .      following the argument that leads to eqs .   and",

    "it is worth stressing that promoting @xmath56 is independent of resumming the kinetic term of @xmath116 , which is shown below to be responsible for generating @xmath10 at lo .",
    "that is , even if we decide to live with the slow convergence of perturbative @xmath74 , the dibaryon still presents itself as a viable option for absorbing the @xmath115 divergence of @xmath47 .",
    "the term @xmath56 defying naive dimensional analysis has another consequence in addition to affecting the quark - mass dependence of the @xmath3 amplitude .",
    "as indicated by lagrangian  , the promoted @xmath56 gives rise to an unsuppressed , nonderivative @xmath117 coupling : @xmath118    again , renormalization of other lagrangian parameters is perhaps most elucidated in the form of modified ere : @xmath119 with the generalized scattering length and generalized effective range defined for @xmath120 as @xmath121 where @xmath122 thus , we arrive at the desired scalings for @xmath123 and @xmath10 . for a finite value of @xmath50 , @xmath10 has residual @xmath50 dependence that vanishes at the rate of @xmath124 .",

    "since they are somewhat out of the main line of the physics , i relegate the technical details of its construction to appendix  [ sec_wavefunciton ] .",
    "the most general dibaryon lagrangian is bound to have many redundant terms because there will not be enough observables to pin them down , due to the fact that @xmath12 does not correspond to any particle appearing in asymptotic states .",
    "i choose to minimize the number of @xmath12-related operators and to have four - nucleon contact operators be responsible for improving short - range interactions at subleading orders .",
    "this choice means that after the @xmath12 exchange taking away the dominant part of short - range interactions , @xmath31 of the dibaryon lagrangian represents higher - order effects : @xmath127 note that i have slightly modified the scheme of ref .",
