    "in the plasma frequency , a collective oscillation of the electron gas in the positive ionic background occurs , which is fundamental to understand the electromagnetic properties of conductors . below the plasma frequency the conductor reflects the incident electromagnetic radiation and , above it becomes transparent thus allowing a propagative mode . for metals the plasma frequency",
    "is typically found in the ultraviolet region ( @xmath2)@xcite .",
    "a well - known feature of superconductors is the existence of a gap , the energy required to break a cooper pair in the ground state condensate .",
    "typically the frequency associated to the gap for conventional superconductors is in the @xmath3 range , whereas for the new high - tc superconductors is one order magnitude higher @xcite .",
    "the question whether the superconductor can support collective modes _ without _ inducing pair breaking effects is an old one and has been discussed since the early days of the theory of superconductivity @xcite .",
    "apart from the so - called carlson - goldman mode , which happens under special circumstances @xcite , any other attempt to excite collective modes in isotropic _ bulk _ superconductors leads to the destruction of the superconducting state .",
    "this follows the well - known argument@xcite that the coulomb interaction shifts the frequency of such oscillations , the plasma frequency , to above the gap frequency .",
    "however , it was recently shown that highly anisotropic superconductors do display a plasma oscillation below the superconducting gap @xcite .",
    "this oscillation , specially to the layered structure , is due to the josephson coupling between the superconducting planes .",
    "plasma modes in superconductors , isotropic or not , has been recently revisited from another point of view .",
    "plasma modes below the gap are possible without destroying the superconducting state , as long as , they propagate in the interface between the superconductor and a non - conducting bounding medium of very high dieletric constant .",
    "this is the so - called superficial plasma mode @xcite , which is made possible by the charges located at the interface of the superconductor and the dieletric medium , responsible for the creation of an electric field concentrated mainly outside the superconductor .    in a thin film ,",
    "the coupling between the two superficial plasma modes yields two possible branches , a symmetric and a anti - symmetric , similarly to metals@xcite and semiconductors@xcite .",
    "the film thickness must be smaller than the london penetration depth in order to produce this coupling .",
    "oscillations between the kinetic energy of the superelectrons and the electrical field energy take place in these modes and for this reason they are called _ plasma modes_. the lower frequency branch was predicted for superconductors @xcite some time ago and observed in thin granular aluminium films , in the hundreds of @xmath4 range@xcite , and in thin @xmath5 films@xcite , in the higher frequency range of hundreds of @xmath6 .",
    "the highest frequency branch is predicted to be within experimental observation range for the high tc materials@xcite . in case of highly anisotropic superconducting materials , measurements of such upper and lower branches",
    "are expected to give information on the transverse and the longitudinal london penetration depths , respectively@xcite . in conclusion ,",
    "plasma modes in superconducting films can be an important tool for the probe of many intrinsic properties of superconductors .",
    "long ago gittleman and rosenblum@xcite have studied the effects of an applied external current at the radio and microwave frequency range into pinned vortices and obtained the surface impedance . for an @xmath7 applied magnetic field and in the weak pinning regime",
    ", campbell@xcite showed that the effect of vortices can be described by a new @xmath7 london penetration depth , whose square is the original london penetration depth squared plus a new term describing the elastic interaction of vortices with the pinning centers .",
    "a few years ago these models were generalized to convey the effects of creep@xcite and to provide a more detailed description of the elastic properties of the vortex lattice near a surface@xcite .",
    "in this paper we study the effects of a constant uniform magnetic field , applied perpendicularly to the thin film , into the thin film propagative mode .",
    "a sufficiently large magnetic field allows the thermodynamic stability of a vortex system , which influences the collective oscilations , affecting considerably the above modes .",
    "the vortices are induced into an oscillatory dissipative motion around their pinning centers .",
    "this motion couples to the electromagnetic fields resulting either into an underdamped or an overdamped regime .",
    "this paper is developed in the context of independent vortex and superelectron degrees of freedom .",
    "we understand by superelectron current , any supercurrent other than that one necessary to bring the thermodynamic equilibrium of vortices .",
    "the vortex degree of freedom , described by its position in space , also represents its intrinsic current . in this framework arises the question whether the superelectron or the vortex contribution dominates the propagative mode behavior .",
    "hereafter , by plasma mode we refer to the limit where superelectron contribution is the largest .",
    "so , pure plasma modes are found in the complete absence of an applied magnetic field . in this paper",
    "we discuss conditions that render the modes underdamped and vortex dominated .",
    "this is the case of interest because the attenuated oscillations can be regarded as taking place between the vortex pinning energy and the electrical field energy .",
    "the present work is done in the simplest possible theoretical framework , essentially a generalization of the gittleman - rosenblum@xcite , such that vortices and superelectrons are independently coupled to maxwell s theory .",
    "here we are mainly interested in the low temperature regime and therefore , ignore the contribution of normal electrons to the problem .",
    "thus , wave damping is only due to the vortex dissipative motion .",
    "we consider here an anisotropic superconductor with its uniaxial direction ( c - axis ) orthogonal to the film surfaces : the two london penetration depths , transverse ( @xmath8 ) and longitudinal ( @xmath9 ) to the surfaces give an anisotropy such that @xmath10 .",
    "there are two dielectric constants , the non - conducting medium and the superconductor ones , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "thus we are assigning to the superconductor a frequency independent dielectric constant .",
    "we refer to the speed of light in the dielectric as @xmath13 .",
    "the uniform static applied magnetic field is @xmath14 . for each individual vortex , the viscous drag coefficient is @xmath15 and the elastic restoring force constant ( labusch parameter ) is @xmath16 .",
    "their ratio , @xmath17 , is the so - called depinning frequency , above which dissipation becomes dominant in the vortex motion . to have coupling between the two surfaces the film thickness , @xmath18 ,",
    "must be smaller than @xmath9 .",
    "the choice of a nonconducting bounding medium of very high dieletric constant is crucial to lower the frequency range of the modes to below the gap frequency .",
    "for this reason we take @xmath19 as the bounding media , whose dieletric constant is known to be high up to the @xmath6 frequency @xcite at low temperatures : @xmath20 .",
    "then the speed of light in the dielectric , @xmath21 , is substantially smaller than @xmath22 .",
    "our work is restricted to identical top and bottom dielectric media , which does not imply lack of generality .",
    "similar conclusions should also apply to the general asymmetric case .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section([section1 ] ) we introduce the major equations describing the film mode in the presence of vortices .",
    "its dispersion relation is analytically derived under some justifiable approximation . in section [ section2 ]",
    "we apply our model to the high - tc superconductor @xmath23 , investigating a range of parameters such that the lowest energy film mode is mostly associated to the vortex dynamics , but yet remains underdamped .",
    "finally , in section [ section3 ] , we summarize our major results .",
    "in this section we introduce the basic equations governing wave propagation in a superconducting film sandwiched between two identical non - conducting dielectric media and subjected to an uniform static magnetic field perpendicularly applied to the film surface",
    ". an external electromagnetic wave of angular frequency @xmath24 and vacuum wavenumber @xmath25 is inserted in the dielectric bounded film .",
    "we determine the dispersion relation of the lowest energy film mode , whose imaginary part reveals the attenuation behavior .",
    "phenomenological theories , such as the present one , only describe the superconductor in a energy range much lower than the pair breaking threshold .",
    "the electromagnetic dynamics of fields and superelectrons is described by the maxwell s equations , @xmath26 and consequently by the continuity equation , @xmath27 where @xmath28 represents the space and time dependent charge density , @xmath29 is its equilibrium value and @xmath30 stands for the electron charge .",
    "the distinction between @xmath28 and @xmath29 is necessary because , propagation through the system disrupts the neutrality , as seen from gauss law ( @xmath31 ) , and the local charge density is no longer constant .",
    "as previously noticed the contribution of vortices and of superelectrons are independent in the present model .",
    "the field @xmath32 , the superelectron current density involved in net macroscopic transport , and the field @xmath33 , the vortex displacement from its equilibrium position are independent in the present model .",
    "hence the supercurrent density @xmath32 corresponds to a macroscopic average of the total superelectron motion , where the supercurrent necessary to establish each vortex averages to zero .",
    "this approximation , valid for the present purposes , can not give any information on the supercurrent distribution surrounding each vortex line .",
    "the simplest possible model that treats the response of the vortices to the presence of a supercurrent external to them is the harmonic approximation of gittleman and rosenblum@xcite , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a unit vector parallel to the flux lines mean direction . > from its turn , the displacements of vortices from their equilibrium positions affect the propagating electromagnetic wave .",
    "fiory and hebard@xcite have considered this question and found that besides the kinetic inductance due to the superelectrons , the moving vortices also contribute , producing an electric field inside the superconductor .",
    "@xmath36    the assumption of anisotropy yields a tensorial london penetration depth .",
    "we pick a coordinate system where the two plane parallel surfaces separating the superconducting film from the dielectric medium are at @xmath38 and @xmath39 , such that @xmath40 and propagation is along the @xmath41 axis .",
    "vortex displacement is described by a vector field parallel to the surfaces , @xmath42 , with no orthogonal components to them ( @xmath43 ) . according to symmetry arguments ,",
    "all fields for the present geometry can be expressed as @xmath44}$ ] , where the wave number @xmath45 have yet to be determined .",
    "because vortex motion is dissipative , the wave s amplitude decays exponentially with distance , and one obtains for the fields s expression @xmath46}$ ] .",
    "then wave number is a complex number , @xmath47 .",
    "solving maxwell s equations for the chosen geometry gives two independent sets of field components , the transverse electric ( te ) and the transverse magnetic ( tm ) propagating modes . in the former the non - zero electromagnetic field components are @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50",
    ", the non - vanishing supercurrent is @xmath51 and the vortex displacement is along the direction of wave propagation ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "this is an extremely high frequency mode in the present theory , and so not interesting because it lies above the gap . for the latter ,",
    "the non - zero electromagnetic field components are @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , the non - vanishing supercurrent components are @xmath56 and @xmath57 and the propagating wave displaces the vortices perpendicularly to its direction of propagation ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "this is a very interesting mode because it supports low frequency propagating waves .",
    "the major difference between te and tm modes is that the latter displays superficial charge densities at the film - dielectric interfaces and the former does not .",
    "such superficial charge densities stem from the supercurrent component orthogonal to the film surface , @xmath56 , which is discontinuous at the interfaces , thus rendering a strong coupling between the superconducting film and the bounding media .    introducing the time dependence @xmath59 into eq.([greq ] ) and eq.([fheq ] ) results in a change of the penetration depth parallel to the surfaces due to the vortex contribution@xcite .",
    "@xmath60 this equation shows that vortices and superelectrons contribute additively to the parallel penetration depth .",
    "notice the depinning frequency @xmath61 establishes two distinct physical regions for the vortices response . for",
    "@xmath62 dissipation is weak and @xmath63 is essentially a real number . for @xmath64 and a sufficiently large magnetic field",
    ", dissipation dominates the vortices response because @xmath63 is complex .",
    "the superconductor s dielectric constant is tensorial , @xmath65 and for the tm mode we have that @xmath66    the tm field equations for the dielectric medium , ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) , are given bellow : @xmath69 and the ones for the superconducting film ( @xmath70 ) follow .",
    "the dispersion relations follow from the continuity of the ratio @xmath72 at a single interface , say @xmath38 , once assumed the longitudinal field @xmath55 has a definite symmetry .",
    "it happens in this way because , the superconductor film is bounded by the same dielectric medium in both sides . solving eq.([eqdie ] )",
    "one gets that above the film ( @xmath73 ) , @xmath74 > from eq.([eqsuc ] ) we learn that for the superconducting film ( @xmath70 ) there are two possible states , symmetrical and anti - symmetrical , where the longitudinal field is expressed by @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively . as discussed earlier , we shall only consider the symmetric branch , the lowest mode in energy .",
    "so the ratio of the tangential fields becomes @xmath77 .",
    "continuity of this ratio across the interface gives the following implicit relation .",
    "@xmath78 to find the dispersion relation we must solve eq.([tab1 ] ) .",
    "here we use an approximate method to analytically solve it",
    ". this approximation amounts to replace the function @xmath79 in eq.([tab1 ] ) , by another function , @xmath80 , which has an extremely close behavior . for @xmath81",
    "both functions coincide up to the second order term in the taylor series expansion : @xmath82 .",
    "as all our results are derived in the range @xmath83 thus , we replace eq.([tab1 ] ) by the following approximate dispersion relation . @xmath84",
    "squaring the above expression , one obtains a linear equation for @xmath85 : @xmath86 the term proportional to @xmath87 in the numerator is irrelevant , assuming the film much thinner than the penetration depth ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "we restrict the present study to frequencies much below the assymptotic frequency ( @xmath89 ) , thus obtaining the following dispersion relation : @xmath90 in the absence of an applied uniform magnetic field ( @xmath91 ) , consequently with no vortices , there is no dissipation and @xmath92 . in this case",
    "we retrieve the well - known dispersion relation of plasma modes taking into account the retardation effect @xcite .",
    "next we study two different behaviors of the dispersion relation in the presence of vortices .    0.5truecm    @xmath93 at low frequencies the mode is , in leading order , a plane wave travelling in the dielectric medium , @xmath94 , with no attenuation along the direction of propagation , ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "perpendicularly to the film , the amplitude shows no attenuation , because @xmath96 , according to eq.([ex ] ) .",
    "we obtain , from the taylor expansion of eq.([drap2 ] ) , the lowest order corrections in @xmath24 to the above description of the optical regime . @xmath97",
    "0.5truecm    @xmath98 for sufficiently large frequencies , eq.([drap3 ] ) no more describes a linear response . in this range the superconducting film and the dieletric media are effectively coupled , which implies in a reduction of the mode propagation speed ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "this is the most interesting regime since film and dielectric produce a low energy mode .    far - way from the linear regime , and",
    "provided that the asymptotic frequency is still out of range , eq.([drap3 ] ) is approximately described by its second term , resulting into the dispersion relation @xmath100 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "> from this , we obtain its wavevector and attenuation : @xmath101 in the frequency range where the above dispersion relation is a valid approximation , the ratio between the real and the imaginary parts of the london penetration depth , determines whether the mode is overdamped or underdamped : @xmath102 .",
    "the cross - over magnetic field , @xmath103 splits the regimes of superelectron ( @xmath104 ) , and vortex ( @xmath105 ) dominance . in these limits",
    "eq.([lbar ] ) can be replaced by approximated expressions , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 , respectively .",
    "recall the assumption of the present model that the superelectron contribution is never dissipative . if in addition to an applied magnetic field much larger than @xmath108 , we choose a frequency range @xmath109 , then @xmath110 and the mode is underdamped .",
    "the dispersion relation follows a square root dependence , and becomes , @xmath111 in this interesting limit the mode energy shows many oscillations between vortex and electric field energies before dissipation dominates . at higher frequency ( @xmath112 ) this is no longer possible , since the mode becomes overdamped due to the large dissipation of vortices above the depinning frequency .",
    "the frequency @xmath61 coarsely defines a cross - over region between the underdamped and the overdamped regimes .",
    "in the next section , using experimental parameters measured on @xmath0 , we search for favorable conditions in frequency and magnetic field to observe underdamped coupled modes on a thin film .",
    "in this section a @xmath23 thin film is taken , as an example , to determine a frequency and magnetic field window where the mode is coupled , underdamped and vortex dominated .",
    "the wave must be underdamped in order to travel over many wavelengths before its amplitude is completely attenuated . for this high - tc superconductor",
    "the anisotropy ( @xmath113 ) and the zero - temperature london penetration depth along the @xmath114 planes are well - known .",
    "@xcite . at very low temperature several experiments",
    "@xcite have determined the viscosity and the labusch constant , all giving the same numbers , which are summarized in table i. such parameters have a temperature dependence@xcite , not taken into account here because we only consider a fixed low temperature , namely , @xmath1 .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of the labusch constant , known to exist for high - tc materials@xcite and low - tc ones@xcite , is not considered either . for this discussion",
    "we choose the film thickness @xmath115 .",
    "1.0truecm    table i  : properties of the high - tc material @xmath23 at t = @xmath116 +    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     1.0truecm    fig.[fig1 ] provides a pictorial intuitive view of the wave propagation inside the superconducting film for the tm symmetric propagating mode .",
    "dimensions are out of proportion in order to enhance some of the most relevant features .",
    "only the electric field lines inside the superconducting film are shown .",
    "the superficial charges are also shown and , represents the sources of this propagating electric field .",
    "the electric field lines show a very important feature of this wave@xcite , namely , the supercurrent component along the wave propagation direction , @xmath57 , is dominant over @xmath56 .",
    "a magnetic field perpendicularly applied to the film surfaces produces vortices , pictorially represented at the top surface . the oscillatory displacement suffered by vortices , because of the driving lorentz force caused by @xmath57 ( eq.([greq ] ) ) , is also shown in this figure .",
    "as previously discussed , the adequate choice of frequency and magnetic field windows is fundamental to observe the lower energy mode .",
    "we can distinguish several different regions within the @xmath117 vs. @xmath118 diagram .",
    "fig.[fig2 ] shows such regions for @xmath0 , according to the above parameters .",
    "two cross - over lines separate this diagram in three different regions : the optical regime , the underdamped coupled regime and the overdamped coupled regime .    the lower line in fig.[fig2 ] , called @xmath119 , separates the optical region from the coupled regions .",
    "this cross - over line is defined through eq.([kop ] ) , using as conditon that the second term becomes a non negligible fraction @xmath120 of the first term and so can no longer be ignored , @xmath121 we have arbitrarily chosen ten percent ( @xmath122 ) as our criterion for the optical mode boundary .    the upper line in fig.[fig2 ] , called @xmath123 , is related to the dissipation and separates the underdamped to the overdamped regimes .",
    "the criterion for dissipation is the ratio @xmath124 , which for the coupled regime , is approximately given by the ratio between the real and the imaginary part of the squared penetration depth @xmath125 ( eq.([lbar ] ) ) , according to eq.([cap ] ) .",
    "thus our second cross - over line is defined by @xmath126 where @xmath127 is an arbitrary factor .",
    "this condition gives a second degree equation for @xmath128 , @xmath129 , whose solutions , @xmath130 , form the upper and lower branches of a single curve that encircles the overdamped regime area .",
    "@xmath131 therefore , the dissipative region demands a minimum applied field @xmath132 to exist , defined by the vanishing of the above square root : @xmath133 hence the two curves @xmath134 and @xmath135 have a common start at @xmath136 , where @xmath137 , and approach the asymptotic lines @xmath138 and @xmath139 , respectively . for the diagram in fig.[fig2 ] , we have taken @xmath140 thus , obtaining that @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "the asymptotic lines become @xmath143 and @xmath144 .    as indicated by the @xmath117 vs. @xmath24 fig.[fig2 ] diagram , the modes are optical for frequencies below the @xmath119 line where they are weakly affected by the superconductor properties and the vortex dynamics . in this region and for @xmath145",
    "the superelectron dominates over the vortex response and , effectively , there are plasma modes . for @xmath146 , the @xmath119",
    "line decreases inversely proportional to @xmath117 . above the @xmath147 line , and , at large magnetic fields , @xmath148 , the modes become overdamped .",
    "thus the interesting region lies above the @xmath119 line and below the @xmath147 line , where the modes are underdamped coupled and vortex dominated . in this intermediate region , dissipation should be small enough ( @xmath149 ) to allow wave propagation over some wavelengths before attenuation sets in .",
    "all figures discussed below were obtained using eq.([drap3 ] ) expression . the complex wave number @xmath45 is then easily derived as a function of @xmath24 .",
    "fig.[fig3 ] shows the dispersion relation @xmath24 vs. @xmath150 for @xmath151 and @xmath152 . in case of zero magnetic field ,",
    "the frequency window considered in this figure is below the zero magnetic field optical - coupled crossover ( @xmath153 ) .",
    "indeed , the @xmath151 mode shows a quasi linear dependence .",
    "however for a magnetic field @xmath152 , the presence of vortices changes dramatically the dispersion relation .",
    "the frequency @xmath119 has droped substantially , according to this figure . below",
    "the mode is optical , similarly to the zero magnetic field case , and above the mode is slow in comparison to the zero field one .",
    "this effect clearly comes from the vortex overwhelming contribution at this large magnetic field value . in this frequency window",
    ", the mode is underdamped until the frequency @xmath147 is reached . above",
    "it turns to be overdamped . in order to better estimate the attenuation ,",
    "we have plotted the ratio @xmath124 for the same frequency window ( fig.[fig4 ] ) .",
    "notice that @xmath124 , obtained from eq.([drap3 ] ) and shown here , gives directly the mode attenuation , whereas eq.([cap ] ) just provides an approximate criterion , used to define the dissipative curve @xmath123 of fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "fig.[fig4 ] shows that for @xmath154 the mode propagates over various wavelengths before its amplitude goes to zero .",
    "according to fig.[fig4 ] @xmath124 diverges for low frequencies within the optical regime .",
    "this behavior is explained recalling that all losses are caused by vortices and disappear at zero frequency .    the reduced speed , defined as the ratio between the phase velocity and the speed of light in the dielectric , @xmath155 is plotted in fig.[fig5 ] . in the optical regime",
    "this ratio is essentially equal to one .",
    "this is quite verifiable at zero magnetic field but not at @xmath156 , where the modes are strongly slowered by the presence of vortices .",
    "in this paper we have studied superficial coupled modes in a superconducting film surrounded by two identical dielectric media with an applied magnetic field perpendicular to the surface .",
    "the superconductor is anisotropic and its uniaxial direction ( c - axis ) is perpendicular to the interfaces with the dielectric medium .",
    "the choice of non - conducting media of high dielectric constant helps to lower the propagating wave frequency range much below the gap frequency .",
    "we consider a static magnetic field above the lowest critical field , that allows for the existence of pinned and dissipative vortices . in the present approach superelectrons and vortices",
    "contribute additively to the impedance .",
    "vortices and superelectrons interact with each other through the lorentz force and through an electric field , created by vortex motion and superelectrons acceleration . here",
    "we have studied how the lowest energy branch , the tm symmetric mode , is affected by vortices . under a justifiable approximation",
    ", we obtain an analytical expression for this dispersion relation , which can describe simultaneously the three different possible behaviors for a propagating mode in a superconducting film subjected to an exterior magnetic field , namely , optical regime , underdamped coupled regime and overdamped coupled regime .",
    "we find that in very high magnetic field , vortices dominate over the superelectrons response .",
    "the modes are well described by the vortex oscillations around their pinning centers where , their energy oscillates between the pinning energy and the electrical one .",
    "we have studied the @xmath117 vs. @xmath24 diagram for a very thin superconducting film , made of the high - tc material @xmath0 .",
    "we find three different regions : optical , underdamped coupled and overdamped modes .",
    "nested between the optical and the overdamped regions , and above a certain critical magnetic field cross - over , is the region of interest . there",
    "exist , in this frequency and magnetic field window , underdamped propagative modes , whose behavior is determined by the vortex response , and not by the superelectrons .",
