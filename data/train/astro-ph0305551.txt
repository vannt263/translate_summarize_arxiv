    "the search for solar - like oscillations is finally yielding success .",
    "observations of the sub - giants procyon @xcite and @xmath1  hydri @xcite have shown very good evidence for oscillations .",
    "more recently , there has been an unambiguous detection of p - mode oscillations in the main sequence star @xmath2  cen  a by @xcite .",
    "all these results were based on velocity measurements obtained using high - dispersion spectrographs with stable reference sources .",
    "another method for detecting oscillations was suggested by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) .",
    "this involved monitoring changes in the equivalent widths ( ews ) of temperature - sensitive spectral lines . in paper",
    "i we reported evidence for oscillations in the g0 sub - giant @xmath3  boo , based on measurements of balmer - line ews .",
    "we presented this as the first clear evidence of solar - like oscillations in a star other than the sun .",
    "the observations were obtained over six nights with the 2.5 m nordic optical telescope on la palma , and consisted of 12684 low - dispersion spectra . in the power spectrum of the equivalent - width measurements , we found an excess of power at frequencies around 850 .",
    "the average amplitude inferred for the oscillations was about 7 times greater than solar , in rough agreement with the empirical scaling relation suggested by @xcite .",
    "comb analysis of the power spectrum , described in paper  i , suggested a regular spacing of @xmath4 . based on this",
    ", we identified thirteen oscillation modes .",
    "similar observations of the daytime sky showed the five - minute solar oscillations at the expected frequencies .",
    "the frequencies for @xmath3  boo reported in paper  i , taken with available estimates of the stellar parameters , were in good agreement with theoretical models @xcite .",
    "particularly exciting was the occurrence in theoretical models  and apparently in the observations  of ` avoided crossings , ' in which mode frequencies are shifted from their usual regular spacing by effects of gravity modes in the stellar core . since then , the improved luminosity estimate for from hipparcos measurements has given even better agreement with the measured value of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , a search for velocity oscillations in by @xcite has failed to detect a signal , setting limits at a level below the value expected on the basis of the ew results .",
    "although the data were sparse ( 22 hours spread over 7 successive nights ) and the precision was degraded by the relatively fast rotation of the star ( @xmath6kms@xmath7 ) , the analysis by @xcite was careful and thorough , and the results seem to be inconsistent with those of paper  i. more recently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and paper in preparation ) reported velocity measurements using the coralie and elodie spectrographs that showed a clear excess of power and a frequency spacing of @xmath8 .",
    "in this paper we present additional observations of , obtained in 1998 in both ew and velocity .",
    "we also re - analyse our 1994 ew measurements and the velocity measurements of @xcite .",
    "we confirm our earlier claim for oscillations in and identify more than twenty oscillation frequencies from the combined data .",
    "we observed over six nights during may 1998 using alfosc ( andalucia faint object spectrograph and camera ) on the 2.5 m nordic optical telescope on la palma .",
    "this is the same telescope used in paper  i but with a different spectrograph .",
    "we obtained seven echelle orders covering the range 370700 nm at a dispersion of 0.04nm / pixel .",
    "the ccd was a loral 2k by 2k device , of which we used 700 by 1200 pixels .",
    "spectra were taken with a typical exposure time of 11s and a dead time between exposures of 17s .",
    "they were averaged in groups of three before writing to disk , resulting in a total of 1843 spectra ( sampling rate 1/84s ) in 44.2 hours over six consecutive nights ( 1998 may 16 ) .",
    "the distribution of spectra over the six nights was : 88 , 222 , 377 , 391 , 358 and 407 .",
    "we used the method described by @xcite to measure equivalent widths of six strong temperature - sensitive lines : h@xmath2 , h@xmath1 , h@xmath9 , mgi , nai and fei .",
    "a weighted mean of these six values was calculated , taking into account the differing temperature sensitivities of the lines .",
    "the resulting time series is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.not98-time ] .",
    "we also observed  in 1998 with the hamilton echelle spectrometer and the 0.6-m coud auxiliary telescope ( cat ) at lick observatory @xcite . to produce high - precision velocity measurements ,",
    "the star was observed through an iodine absorption cell mounted directly in the telescope beam .",
    "we were allocated 56 of the 59 nights from 1998 april  6 to june  3 , but the weather was unseasonably poor , permitting observations on only 26 nights ( and many of these were partly lost ) .",
    "the exposure time was 120s , with a dead time between exposures of the same amount .",
    "on the 11 best nights we obtained 95120 spectra per night ( sampling rate : 1/245s ) , and the total number of spectra obtained was 1989 ( about one third of that possible with no weather losses ) .",
    "extraction of radial velocities from the echelle spectra followed the method described by @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the precision is degraded by the relatively fast stellar rotation .",
    "the star is a spectroscopic binary with a period of 494d @xcite , and the orbital motion was removed from the velocity time series by fitting and subtracting a fifth - order polynomial .",
    "the resulting velocity measurements are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.lick-time ] .",
    "we are confident that the long - term velocity variations are not instrumental , given that velocities for @xmath10  ceti , which we observed on most of the nights , were stable at the 5 level .",
    "these night - to - night variations in are presumably due to stellar activity , which is commonly observed in rotating g - type stars ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have included in this analysis the time series of 12684 ew measurements obtained with the nordic optical telescope in 1994 .",
    "these are identical to the data presented in paper  i , with the exception that a high - pass filter was not applied .",
    "the result is an increase in noise at low frequencies , as expected from a @xmath11 noise source , which more accurately reflects the actual stellar and instrumental noise ( for more details , see * ? ? ?",
    "we have also analysed 555 velocity measurements of obtained with the afoe spectrograph during 22 hours spread over seven successive nights in 1995 march .",
    "these measurements were described by @xcite and were kindly provided to us in electronic form by tim brown .",
    "the power spectrum of each time series was calculated as a weighted least - squares fit of sinusoids @xcite , with a weight being assigned to each point according its uncertainty estimate .",
    "the results for the four data sets are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig.first-power][fig.last-power ] . in each case",
    ", we show both the conventional power spectrum ( upper panels ) and a smoothed version in which the vertical scale has been converted to power density ( lower panels ) . as discussed by (",
    "* appendix a.1 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sec .  5 ) ,",
    "the conversion to power density is achieved by multiplying by the effective observing time , which we calculated in each case by integrating under the spectral window .",
    "some level of excess power in the range 6001100 is apparent in all four data sets , although it is strongest in the not94 data .",
    "further discussion of the measured power levels is given below in sec .",
    "[ sec.amplitudes ] .",
    "first , however , we will discuss the oscillation frequencies .",
    "mode frequencies for low - degree solar - like oscillations are approximated reasonably well by the asymptotic relation : @xmath12 here , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are integers that define the radial order and angular degree of the mode , respectively ; @xmath5 ( the so - called large separation ) reflects the average stellar density , @xmath15 is sensitive to the sound speed near the core and @xmath16 is sensitive to the surface layers .",
    "it is conventional to define @xmath17 , the so - called small separation , as the frequency spacing between adjacent modes with @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we can further define @xmath20 to be the amount by which @xmath21 modes are offset from the midpoint between the @xmath18 modes on either side . if the asymptotic relation holds exactly , then it is straightforward to show that @xmath22 .",
    "we extracted the frequencies of the strongest peaks in each power spectrum in the range 6001100 .",
    "we used a simple iterative algorithm , in which the highest peak was identified and the corresponding sinusoidal variation was subtracted from the time series .",
    "the power spectrum of the residuals was then calculated and the process was iterated until all peaks with amplitudes more than 2.5 times the noise floor had been extracted .",
    "the numbers of peaks extracted from the four data sets are summarized in table  [ tab.peaks ] .",
    "setting the threshold at 2.5@xmath23 gives us a chance to detect the weaker oscillation modes , but it also means we will select some noise peaks . to investigate this ,",
    "we have conducted simulations in which we analysed noise spectra that contained no signal .",
    "the last column in table  [ tab.peaks ] shows the number of peaks found above the 2.5@xmath23 threshold .",
    "this indicates that about 6 of the 35 detected peaks are expected to be due to noise .",
    "we next investigated whether the extracted frequencies have a regular spacing , as is expected for p - mode oscillations . in paper",
    "i , we described a comb analysis of the not94 power spectrum that revealed a regular spacing of @xmath4 . here , we analyse the 22 frequencies from the other three data sets ( afoe95 , not98 , lick98 ) using autocorrelation , as follows .",
    "firstly , each extracted frequency was allocated a power corresponding to the square of its s / n , in order to give higher weight to the more reliable peaks . secondly , to allow for the likelihood that some of the extracted frequencies should be shifted by @xmath241d@xmath7 ( @xmath2411.57 ) , we extended the table of frequencies by a factor of three by including these side - lobes ( but with half the power of the central peaks ) .",
    "we then calculated the autocorrelation of these 66 frequencies .",
    "this is shown , smoothed to a resolution of 3.5 , as the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig.auto ] .",
    "the three peaks in the autocorrelation correspond to the large separation and its daily aliases , leading us to estimate a value of @xmath0 . for comparison , the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig.auto ] shows the autocorrelation for the 13 frequencies extracted from the not94 data , which yields a large separation of @xmath25 .",
    "the excellent agreement between these independent data sets confirms the result of paper  i and also agrees well with the value of @xmath8 reported by @xcite . in summary",
    ", there can be no doubt that the large frequency separation of is about 40 , which is in excellent agreement with theoretical models @xcite .",
    "given the large separation , we next attempted to identify the individual modes , remembering that some of them will need to be shifted by @xmath2411.57 . figure  [ fig.echelle-raw ] shows the 35 frequencies from all four data sets , displayed in an echelle diagram .",
    "we expect modes with a given @xmath14  value to form vertical ridges , for @xmath18 , @xmath26 and  @xmath27 .",
    "we were able to achieve this by shifting 15 frequencies by @xmath2411.57 , as shown in the figure .",
    "the final frequencies are given in table  [ tab.peaksid ] .",
    "note that the number of peaks that are classified as noise is consistent with the estimates made above ( see table  [ tab.peaks ] ) .",
    "a possible problem is that , modulo the large separation , peaks corresponding to ( @xmath28 ) for @xmath21 are only separated by 1.1 from peaks corresponding to ( @xmath29 ) for @xmath19 .",
    "it is possible that some of those peaks have been shifted the wrong way and are therefore wrongly identified .",
    "the relevant peaks are @xmath30 ( from lick98 ) , which we identified as an alias of an @xmath21 mode , and @xmath31 ( from not94 ) , which we identified as an alias of an @xmath19 mode . a similar comment , although to a lesser extent , applies to peaks corresponding to ( @xmath28 ) for @xmath18 and to ( @xmath29 ) for @xmath21 , which are only separated by 1.9 .",
    "note that we have identified the peak at 749.3 as possibly being an @xmath21 mode that is displaced by an avoided crossing .",
    "this peak has the second - highest s / n of all the peaks and is therefore not likely to be due to noise or to be an alias . in any case , shifting this peak by @xmath2411.57 would not bring it into agreement with @xmath18 or  2 .",
    "some of the frequencies are detected more than once , as indicated by the ditto marks  (  ) in table  [ tab.peaksid ] . in those cases ,",
    "we have combined the measurements into a weighted average .",
    "the final list of 21 frequencies is given in table  [ tab.final ] , and these are shown as an echelle diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig.echelle-final ] .",
    "the uncertainties in the frequencies reflect the s / n of the relevant peak ( or peaks ) .",
    "we next estimated the large separation separately for each value of @xmath14 , and the results are given in the last line of table  [ tab.final ] ( the two modes marked with an asterisk , which may be affected by avoided crossings , were excluded from the fit ) .",
    "the weighted average of these three @xmath32 yields the value of @xmath5 shown in table  [ tab.splittings ] .",
    "the other parameters in that table were calculated by fitting the same 19 frequencies to the asymptotic relation .",
    "all are consistent with the values given in paper  i but have smaller uncertainties , thanks to the larger number of detected frequencies .    in fig .",
    "[ fig.echelle-final ] we also show the 13 frequencies reported in paper  i. we can see that six were recovered in the new analysis , while five were not recovered but lie close to one of the ridges ( within typical uncertainties ) , so perhaps can still be taken as reliable detections .",
    "finally , two frequencies ( 786.2 and 950.3 ) fall well away from the @xmath21 ridge and were not confirmed by the revised analysis .",
    "it is possible that they represent mixed modes that are shifted by avoided crossings , but further observations are needed to confirm this .",
    "the above analysis gives strong evidence that the highest peaks in the four power spectra are due to solar - like oscillations .",
    "however , we have also noted that the amplitude of the power excess is somewhat stronger in the not94 observations than in the other three data sets .",
    "it seems plausible that these differences reflect the stochastic nature of the excitation mechanism , but a more definite statement is hampered by our limited knowledge of the amplitudes of oscillations in subgiant stars .",
    "it is also possible that some contribution to the variations is due to an unidentified systematic error in the calibration that was used to convert equivalent - width amplitudes to velocities ( see paper  i )",
    ".    taken at face value , the observations indicate that peak oscillation amplitudes in are typically 35 times solar .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the upper limits reported by @xcite from the afoe95 data .",
    "we have presented new observations of in velocity ( lick98 ) and equivalent width ( not98 ) that show some evidence for excess power in the range 6001100 .",
    "the velocity measurements published by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* afoe95 ) also show a slight power excess when smoothed .",
    "none of these signals is as strong as the original equivalent - width observations ( paper  i , not94 ) , which may reflect the stochastic nature of the excitation or may indicate a problem with the calibration of the not94 equivalent - width estimates .",
    "we extracted the highest peaks in each data set and used the autocorrelation to search for regularity .",
    "the three newer data sets ( afoe95 , not98 and lick98 ) combined to give a clear autocorrelation signal at a spacing of @xmath0 , giving independent confirmation of the result of paper  i. this , combined with the recent work by @xcite , leaves little doubt that the large frequency separation of is about 40",
    ". this allowed us to identify 21 frequencies in which have been compared with theoretical models by @xcite .",
    "the results confirm the claim made in paper  i for the first clear evidence of solar - like oscillations in a star other than the sun .",
    "future observations of , particularly with the _ most _ spacecraft @xcite , should measure more oscillation modes with greater frequency precision .      we thank tim brown for providing the afoe velocity measurements of . this work was supported financially by the australian research council ( trb and ikb ) , national science foundation grant ast-9988087 ( rpb ) , sun microsystems , and the danish natural science research council and the danish national research foundation through its establishment of the theoretical astrophysics center ( hk ) .",
