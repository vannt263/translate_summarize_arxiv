    "we report on @xmath23 galaxies selected from the wfc3/ir early release science ( ers ) observations over the goods - south field ( @xcite , r.  j.  bouwens et al . in preparation ) , complemented with candidates from the recent ultradeep survey with wfc3/ir over the hudf09 field ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "little is known about the stellar masses , metal production , and the contribution of star formation to reionization in these galaxies .",
    "mid - infrared observations with the infrared array camera ( irac ; @xcite ) on _ spitzer _ can been used to constrain the stellar masses and ages , which has lead to the surprising discovery of quite massive @xmath25 galaxies at @xmath26 @xcite and appreciable ages ( @xmath27myr ) and @xmath15s as early as @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the overall results suggest the galaxies formed substantial amounts of stars at even earlier times , well into the epoch of reionization @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we study the stellar populations of the largest sample of @xmath23 galaxies with irac measurements to date , focusing on correlations with luminosity and stellar mass , and implications for the mass density and @xmath2 .",
    "we adopt an @xmath28 cosmology with @xmath29  km  s@xmath30mpc@xmath30 .",
    "magnitudes are in the ab photometric system @xcite .",
    "our sample consists of sources derived from the ultradeep wfc3/ir hudf , the deep wfc3/ir ers , and wide - area nicmos over the cdf - s and cdf - n .",
    "candidates were selected using the @xmath0 @xmath1dropouts and @xmath2 @xmath13dropouts , as used in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ( see also r.  j.  bouwens et al . in preparation ) .",
    "we now briefly discuss the irac photometry from the new ers sample .",
    "the spitzer / irac data over the wfc3/ers area in the cdf - s ( @xmath31 hours integration time ) was obtained from the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ; m. dickinson et al . in preparation ) .. the irac depths in the @xmath32 and @xmath33bands are @xmath34 and @xmath35 magnitude ( @xmath36 , total , point source ) , respectively .",
    "obtaining reliable irac fluxes of the candidates is challenging because of the contamination from the extended psf wings of nearby foreground sources .",
    "we remove contaminating flux , by modeling the candidates and nearby sources using their isolated flux profiles and positions in the deep wfc3/ir maps as templates .",
    "we convolve the templates to match the irac psf , simultaneously fit them to the irac map leaving only the fluxes as free parameters , and subtract the best - fit models to the foreground sources ( see @xcite ) . after cleaning the irac images , we perform conventional aperture photometry in the @xmath32 and @xmath37 bands in 25 diameter apertures on 15 of the original 18 @xmath1dropout galaxies over the wfc3/ir ers .",
    "three were too close to bright sources for reliable measurement .",
    "fluxes were corrected by a factor @xmath38 to account for light outside the aperture ( consistent with point source profiles ) .",
    "six of the 15 galaxies are undetected in irac ( @xmath39<26.5$],@xmath40 ) .",
    "errors include the uncertainty in the best - fit confusion correction , added in quadrature .",
    "we complete the sample with 21 @xmath0 galaxies with irac measurements from the hudf @xcite and from the recent wide - area nicmos search ( * ? ? ?",
    "* r.  j.  bouwens , in preparation ) .",
    "the total sample consists of 36 @xmath0 galaxies spanning 4 magnitudes in @xmath41 . to investigate trends with magnitude",
    ", we stacked the flux densities of the galaxies in three @xmath42magnitude bins centered on @xmath43 and @xmath44 , containing 11 , 15 , and 10 galaxies respectively .",
    "the uncertainties are determined by bootstrapping . stacking increases the snr , in particular for faint galaxies , where the uncertainty in the mass is driven by the snr in irac ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we derive stellar masses and redshifts by fitting stellar populations synthesis models to the average sed fluxes using the @xmath45fitting code fast @xcite .",
    "we adopt ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bc03 ) models with a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) between @xmath46  @xmath47 .",
    "we explore several sfhs and the effects of metallicity and dust .",
    "the differences with more recent models ( e.g. , @xcite , charlot & bruzual , in preparation ) are small and will not be considered in detail ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we fit models smoothed to a resolution of 100    rest - frame , corresponding to the approximate width of the dropout selection windows . adopting a @xcite",
    "imf reduces the stellar masses and sfrs by @xmath48  dex , but does not change other parameters or the quality of fit .",
    "the typical uncertainties in the derived average stellar masses , sfrs , age , and @xmath49 for the stacked seds are 0.15  dex , 0.25  dex , 0.3  dex , and 0.1  mag , respectively .",
    "the photometry and best - fit model parameters are presented in table  1 .",
    "figure  1 ( _ left panel _ ) shows the broadband seds of the @xmath0 @xmath1dropout galaxies in the three magnitude bins , with the best - fit bc03 stellar population models .",
    "the overall sed shapes are remarkably similar , with a pronounced jump between @xmath41 and @xmath39 $ ] ( or rest - frame @xmath50 ) indicative of a modest balmer break and evolved stellar populations ( @xmath4myr ) . focusing on the far@xmath6 continuum , we find the slope @xmath51 ( traced by the @xmath52 color ) to be very blue , and decreasing from @xmath53 at @xmath54 to @xmath8 at @xmath55 .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , such extremely blue slopes require low dust content @xmath56 , very low metallicities and/or very young ages .",
    "small @xmath57 mag changes in the wfc3/ir zeropoints ( e.g. , @xcite ) would cause changes of @xmath58 , comparable to the random uncertainties .",
    "the red @xmath59 $ ] color , however , implies more evolved stellar populations ( @xmath4myr ) , leaving the models seemingly unable to match the entire sed .    to explore the mismatch",
    "further we consider in more detail the effects on metallicity , sfh , and nebular emission .",
    ".  1 ( _ right panel _ ) shows the @xmath52 versus @xmath59 $ ] colors of the observed stacked seds .",
    "the lines show predictions of @xmath60 bc03 models for various continuous sfhs ( rising , constant , declining ) .",
    "generally , evolved models are able to reproduce the joint @xmath52 versus @xmath59 $ ] colors of the more luminous @xmath61 galaxies , but not the colors of the faintest , bluest galaxies .",
    "the arrows show the effect of changes in model assumptions , which we will discuss now :    _ 1 ) metallicities : _ low metallicities ( e.g. , @xmath60 ) do a decent job of producing much bluer @xmath62 than solar at a given @xmath59 $ ] color .",
    "very low metallicities ( @xmath63 solar ) produce even bluer @xmath62 s , but also bluen @xmath64 .",
    "metallicity alone appears not enough to fully resolve the discrepancy .",
    "_ 2 ) nebular emission : _ nebular emission lines ( nel ) likely contribute to the irac fluxes , reddening the @xmath59 $ ] color .",
    "empirical estimates of [ oiii]5007 emission at @xmath65 are scarce , but we can infer the possible effect from the observed strength of h@xmath66 at @xmath67 @xcite . assuming w@xmath68 and w@xmath694959,5007+h\\beta}= 2.5 \\times w_{h\\alpha}$ ] , appropriate for @xmath60 galaxies at @xmath65 @xcite , and adopting a redshift distribution of @xmath70 @xcite we calculate a contribution of 0.18 mag to @xmath39 $ ] and 0.14 mag at @xmath71 $ ] ( see fig  1 ) .",
    "note however , that no measurements of nebular lines at @xmath72 exist .",
    "a second possible effect is nebular continuum emission ( nec ) , which would cause a reddening of both @xmath62 and @xmath59 $ ] ( shown are the models of @xcite with @xmath73 , @xmath74myr csf , and 0% escape fraction ) .",
    "both would reduce the discrepancy between models and data by allowing the models to extend to redder @xmath59 $ ] at a given @xmath62 .",
    "note that the extremely blue @xmath62 may require high escape fractions @xmath75 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which would reduce the contribution of nebular emission .",
    "_ 3 ) star formation histories : _ declining sfhs can match the colors of the most luminous , redder galaxies , but their far@xmath6 continua are too red for lower luminosity galaxies .",
    "in contrast , strongly rising sfrs ( sfr@xmath76 , @xmath77 ) exhibit blue @xmath62 but never reach red @xmath59 $ ] in a hubble time @xmath78 and are formally excluded at 95% confidence .",
    "csf is an compromise , providing red @xmath59 $ ] colors generated by on - going assembly of stellar mass , and blue far@xmath6 continua from on - going star formation .",
    "finally , episodic sfh with a 50% duty cyle and 40  myr duration ( i.e. , 20  myr `` on '' , 20  myr `` off '' ) are found to have an interesting mix of properties .",
    "the luminous active phase of the cycle produces a bluer far@xmath6 continuum for a given @xmath59 $ ] color than csf .",
    "the reverse is true in the dimmer passive state .",
    "the net result for a steep @xmath24 lf function is that the luminosity weighted average of cycling galaxies displays bluer far@xmath6 at a given @xmath64 than csf , also reducing the discrepancy .    in summary ,",
    "the model colors match the observations of luminous @xmath0 galaxies reasonably except for the lowest luminosity galaxies , where the blue @xmath79 and the red @xmath59\\sim0.6 $ ] colors remain challenging to fit .",
    "low metallicity csf models come close , but a contribution from nebular line emission to the @xmath39-$]band and/or episodic sfhs are likely needed to resolve the mismatch .",
    "independent constraints on the sfhs can be obtained from the relation between sfr and stellar mass , as shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the sfrs are calculated from the monochromatic @xmath80 luminosity following the prescription of @xcite and corrected for dust using the best - fit @xmath49 .",
    "the galaxies are grouped in bins of sfr ( or @xmath81 ) centered on @xmath82 .",
    "the stellar mass of our @xmath0 sample correlates strongly with the sfr , producing @xmath83 and corresponding to a constant @xmath84 .",
    "the derived stellar mass with emission lines ( see  3 ) would be lower by @xmath85dex .",
    "the scatter around the relation is fairly low @xmath86dex , but that does not exclude significant short - term sfr variation , e.g. , the episodic model (  [ sec.sfh ] ) predicts @xmath87 and a scatter of @xmath88  dex .",
    "we find no galaxies with sfrs much lower or higher than the past averaged sfr ( i.e. , strongly bursting or suppressed .",
    "such galaxies would have satisfied our dropout criteria and would lie in the upper left or lower right corner in fig .",
    "their absence suggests that that the typical star formation timescales are probably a substantial fraction of the hubble time .",
    "instead we find that only 4/22 sources with @xmath89 are undetected at @xmath39 $ ] and no galaxies in the sample have sfrs substantially less than @xmath90 .",
    "to illustrate the diagnostic power of the @xmath91 diagram , we show in the inset in fig .  2 a simulation of galaxies with random formation times and exponentially declining sfrs ( @xmath92myr ) to the same selection limits as our observed sample .",
    "the distribution is clearly different , with no correlation between @xmath93 and sfr , suggesting that star formation timescales for @xmath0 galaxies are probably longer than that .",
    "the detection of @xmath2 galaxies with irac is enticing as it enables us to place stronger constraints on the stellar masses of the highest redshift galaxies than possible from the far@xmath6 alone .",
    "recent studies in the hudf have found no detection ( individual or stacked ) for @xmath2 galaxy candidates @xcite , leaving estimates of the stellar mass density at these redshifts highly uncertain .",
    "here we perform photometry on the 3 @xmath2 @xmath13dropout galaxies in the wfc3/ers sample of r.  j. bouwens et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "these candidates are brighter than found in the hudf ( @xmath94 versus @xmath95 ) .",
    "two galaxies are detected at @xmath39$]$ ] is close to pixels that are affected by `` muxbleed '' , which we subtracted using a 3rd order polynomial fit to the @xmath96 background before performing photometry . ] and we calculate an average @xmath97 in @xmath39 $ ] and @xmath98 in @xmath71 $ ] for the stack of all three ( see fig  3 , top panels ) . the best fits are @xmath99 , high stellar age @xmath100myr , where age@xmath101 for csf and @xmath102 is the time elapsed since the start of star formation . ] , mass - to - light ratios @xmath103 and @xmath104 , and @xmath105 .",
    "overall these properties are comparable to @xmath94 @xmath0 @xmath1dropouts , suggesting modest evolution in the @xmath15 between @xmath106 and @xmath61 .    following the approach of @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we derive integrated stellar mass densities at @xmath2 by multiplying the @xmath107luminosity densities integrated to @xmath108 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* r  .j  .bouwens et al . in preparation ) by the mean @xmath15 derived for the @xmath109 galaxies , yielding @xmath17mpc@xmath18 .",
    "we also recompute the @xmath2 stellar mass density of @xcite using the same @xmath15 .",
    "figure  4 shows the evolution of the stellar mass density from @xmath110 to @xmath106 .",
    "the evolution over @xmath111 is well approximated by @xmath19 @xmath20mpc@xmath21 $ ] over @xmath22 .",
    "using a large sample of 36 @xmath1dropout galaxies based on deep / wide - area wfc3/ir data from the early release science , ultradeep data from the hudf09 , and wide - area nicmos programs , we investigate the stellar population properties at extreme redshifts @xmath23 .",
    "the main results are :    * the average rest - frame far@xmath6 slope at @xmath0 becomes bluer with decreasing luminosity , from @xmath7 ( @xmath112 ) to @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , as reported by @xcite .",
    "the rest - frame @xmath113 becomes bluer as well , but is still moderately red @xmath14 at @xmath9 , apparently excluding extremely young ages @xmath114myr .",
    "if the ages inferred from the simple model fits are correct , galaxies started forming stars very early - on , perhaps as high as @xmath12 .",
    "the blue far@xmath6 slope and red @xmath113 colors remain a challenge to fit , however , even for sub - solar metallicity models .",
    "episodic sfhs with periods of activity and quiescence and/or a ( @xmath115 mag ) contribution of emission lines to the @xmath39-$]band may be required to resolve the mismatch . *",
    "the derived stellar masses correlate with the sfrs at @xmath0 according to @xmath83 , with relatively low scatter @xmath116dex .",
    "emission line contributions of @xmath117 mag to both @xmath39 $ ] and @xmath71 $ ] would shift the relation by @xmath118 dex in mass .",
    "the absence of galaxies with sfrs much lower or higher than the past averaged sfr ( i.e. , strongly bursting or suppressed ) suggests that that the typical star formation timescales are probably a substantial fraction of the hubble time .",
    "note that instantaneously quenched galaxies may fade too quickly to be selected as dropout galaxies .",
    "* the first spitzer / irac detection of @xmath106 galaxies and their red average @xmath59\\approx0.55 $ ] suggest that luminous early galaxies may have substantial @xmath119 , similar to @xmath61 galaxies .",
    "the derived stellar mass density then increases gradually with time following @xmath19 @xmath20mpc@xmath21 $ ] over @xmath22 .",
    "deeper irac data on @xmath120 galaxies are needed to bolster these results .",
    "more nebular emission line measurements of @xmath65 galaxies would help to understand the possible contribution to the broadband fluxes .",
    "additional modeling of the distribution of sfr versus @xmath93 is needed to decipher the sfhs of @xmath0 galaxies .",
