    "detection of gas inside a protoplanetary gap provides quantitative information on the total gas mass content and temperature profile , depending on whether the line emission is optically thin or optically thick @xcite .",
    "direct images and estimates of the survival of the gas inside transition disk cavities are needed to discriminate between scenarios of dust removal , such as grain growth , photo - evaporation and planet - disk interactions .",

    "one way of discriminating between a planet - induced gap and a photoevaporation - induced gap can be based on the sharpness of the transition in surface density at the outer edge of the cavity : dynamical clearing would result in a rather sharp transition if the putative planet is massive @xcite .",
    "millimeter observations of the rotational gas lines are ideal to quantify the amount of gas inside a dust - depleted cavity . moreover , by comparing isotopologue emission from specific regions of the disk in protoplanetary systems we can constrain physical properties of the disk , such as its gas density and gas temperature",

    "gas emission coming from inside the 140  au dust - depleted cavity can be identified in the high velocity channel maps . assuming a keplerian velocity profile and the system parameters listed in table  [ tab : params ] , the observed emission from channels at velocities @xmath22  km  s@xmath11 and @xmath23  km  s@xmath11 , is radiated by gas material contained in a radius of 140 au ( @xmath24  ) , thus coming entirely from inside the dust - depleted cavity .",

    "the models were post - processed and cleaned using the same strategy used to generate our alma maps .",
    "finally , the best fit models were contrasted with the data by visual inspection .",
    "figure  [ fig : model ] shows our best fit model for the structure of hd  142527 transition disk that accounts for the observed  emission .  is a tracer of the disk density distribution , it is optically thin inside the cavity and the maps have high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the best fit model also matches the  maps .",
    "the integrated density distribution of our disk model yields a total ( dust plus gas ) mass of the disk of 0.1  m@xmath99 , consistent with previous estimates based on millimeter continuum observations @xcite .",
    "the model parameters that match the observations are listed in table  [ tab : params ] . a tapered disk slope of @xmath100 accounts for the extended size of the source in . inside the cavity ,",
    "the @xmath76 parameter was set to @xmath101 , in order to reproduce our observed line fluxes .",
    "higher values make the  appear optically thick inside the cavity .",
    "we estimate an uncertainty of 0.01 based on the optical thickness of the lines .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the slope of the density profile inside the cavity does not have to be necessarily decreasing with radius ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* for hd100546 ) .",
    "a flat profile inside the cavity might also be valid , which would imply a shallower gap depth value .",
    "these posibilities will be further explored in a future paper .",
    "our method to estimate the inclination angle differs from previous approaches because it relies on the dynamics of the high velocity gas evidenced by the high velocity channels , whose spatial distribution strongly depends on inclination angle .",
    "previous methods use scattered light and continuum images of the full disk .",
    "continuum images trace the emitting material closer to the mid - plane hence giving an estimate of the inclination of the dust near the midplane .",
    "our approach uses the dynamical model of the gas rotation , giving a good estimate of the gaseous disk s inclination .",
    "there is a degeneracy between inclination angle , @xmath88 , and the mass of the central star , @xmath83 , when trying to compute the kinematic signatures of the rotating gaseous disk . in order to break this degeneracy ,",
    "we run a set of test models for a range of values of @xmath83 and @xmath88 .",
    "the goodness of each fit was evaluated by calculating the reduced @xmath98 , which is defined as @xmath102 , where @xmath46 is the number of the degrees of freedom . for these observations ,",
    "the number of degrees of freedom is 10@xmath103 , which corresponds to the number of visibilities in each dataset .",
    "the minimum @xmath104 ( best fit ) is attained at @xmath105  m@xmath5 and it is equal to 1.001662 . on the other hand , the values of @xmath106 ( defined as @xmath107 ) for @xmath83 equal to 2 and to 2.6  m@xmath5 are 2@xmath1910@xmath108 and 5@xmath1910@xmath108 , respectively .",
    "similar values were found for inclination angles ranging from 20 to 30 degrees . according to our @xmath104 fit in the visibility plane , the model with a central star mass @xmath109  m@xmath99",
    "best reproduces our  data . after fixing the mass to this value",
    ", we estimate the disk s inclination angle .",
    "previous models for the disk in hd  142527 assumed a cavity size of 140  au for both gas and dust and a disk inclination of 20 degrees @xcite .",
    "although the overall multi - wavelength data are consistent with these parameters , they are unable to explain the observed spatio - kinematic morphologies of the co emission lines . in order to reproduce the high velocity channel maps ( wings of the lines ) , a significant increase in the projected velocity closer to the central star",
    "is needed . with a large disk inclination ,",
    "@xmath110 degrees , we obtain a good match with the alma data , reproducing the  morphologies both at systemic velocity and in the high velocity wings .",
    "the excellent signal - to - noise in the high velocity channel maps allows us to determine the inclination of the disk with an accuracy of half a degree .",
    "figure  [ fig : ichi2 ] shows a @xmath98 plot for a distribution of inclination angles , calculated in the @xmath13-plane .    after fixing the inclination angle at 28 deg , we varied the cavity radius in order to find a good match .",
    "the best fit for the cavity radius in the gas is 90@xmath111  au .",
    "the error was obtained from visual inspection of the plotted models against the  data .",
    "it is important to note that the inclination angle best characterises the emission coming from inside the cavity .",
    "our estimate of the inclination angle is consistent with the values determined by @xcite from co @xmath8 observations .",
    "we have conducted a detailed analysis of the , , and  @xmath0 line emission from hd  142527 , focusing on the gas inside the dust - depleted cavity .",
    "there are three main scenarios for clearing central cavities in disks ; photoevaporation by high - energy photons , lowering of dust opacity due to grain - growth and dynamical clearing by a companion object .",
    "@xcite argued against photoevaporation in this source , based mainly on the high accretion rate and large size of the cavity .",
    "our detection of large amounts of co gas inside the cavity furthers the argument against photoevaporation as the main clearing mechanism .",
    "moreover , there is evidence of the presence of a small inner disk inside the cavity @xcite , that would hinder the efficiency of photoevaporating winds .",
    "dust continuum emission at 345  ghz has been detected with alma inside the cavity , but at very low levels and at the limit of the dynamic range .",
    "the exact morphology of this faint signal is sensitive on the details of image synthesis and self - calibration process .",
    "while @xcite find a filamentary morphology , matched to the gap - crossing filaments seen in hco@xmath89(4 - 3 ) , @xcite proposes a compact signal stemming from the inner disk only .",
    "whichever the case , the peak signal at 345  ghz is an upper limit to the emission from mm - sized particles inside the cavity .",
    "the contrast between the bottom of the gap and the outer disk in surface density of mm - emitting grains is @xmath112 ( gap depth of about 0.003% ) .",
    "smaller dust particles , @xmath113 m dust emitting in the near and mid - ir , have eluded detection inside the 90  au gas cavity radius @xcite , although the ir rings are contained in the sub - millimeter ring ( see supplementary information in * ? ? ?",
    "this may imply that all the dust follows a general drop in density inside the 90  au cavity .",
    "the polarimetric data provides upper limits on the surface brightness of the polarized intensity emitted from inside the cavity @xcite .",
    "the current paradigm in giant planet formation holds that planets are manifested indirectly by their imprinted marks on their progenitor disk .",
    "wide gaps will be carved by massive or multiple forming planets @xcite .",
    "the shape of the outer disk inner wall will depend on the planet mass , disk thickness and viscosity of the disk , and on the temperature structure in the disk wall itself @xcite .",
    "the torque of the outermost planet will affect strongly the shape of the inner wall .",
    "the tidal radius of a planet , the so - called hill radius , is defined by @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the radius of the planet s orbit , @xmath116 is the mass of the planet , and @xmath83 is the mass of the central star .",
    "more massive companions have a large sphere of influence , suggesting that they could carve larger gaps with attenuated or tapered - off walls .",
    "the cavity in hd  142527 has a smaller radius in gas than in dust milimeter continuum . in hco@xmath89(4 - 3 )",
    "emission the cavity is even smaller , suggesting that the disk wall is not sharp or vertical but rather tapered off by a large gradient ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cut ] ) .",
    "multiple planets located closer to the star can explain the large size of the cavity @xcite .",
    "a precise analysis of the gas and dust wall in hd  142527 from alma band 6 and band 7 data , based on hydrodynamical models , will be presented in a future publication .",
    "we detected and identified emission from inside the dust - depleted cavity in carbon monoxide isotopologue data of the gas - rich transition disk , in the @xmath0 line of ,  and .",
    "the @xmath12co emission from the inner cavity is optically thick , while  and  appear to be optically thin , providing probes of the temperature and density fields inside the cavity .",
    "the main results of our analysis can be summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "we determined the gas mass inside the gap from the @xmath9co and c@xmath10o emission .",
    "we used two methods : direct measurement of the optically thin lines , and forward modelling using an axysymmetric disk .",
    "the total mass of gas surviving inside the cavity is high @xmath117  m@xmath5 .",
    "we find that the inner cavity is rather small in co gas , compared to its size in dust millimeter and infrared scattered light , with a best - fit radius of 90@xmath118  au .",
    "the drop in density inside the cavity can be modeled as a reduction in gas column density of a factor 50 ( cavity depth of 0.02 ) , given our model for the outer disk , which gives a total mass of 0.1  m@xmath5 .",
    "4 .   the gap wall appears diffuse and tapered - off in the gas distribution , while in dust continuum is manifestly sharper .",
    "the disk inclination is well constrained by the resolved velocity information of the co gas and it attains 28@xmath40.5 degrees , after fixing the central star mass to 2.2  m@xmath5 . 6 .",
    "the center of the disk appears shifted from a central continuum emission by a deprojected distance of @xmath116  au toward the east , assuming a distance of 140  pc to hd  142517 .",
