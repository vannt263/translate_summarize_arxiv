    "the landau kinetic equation for fermi liquids @xcite contains some important differences when compared to the classical boltzmann equation for a dilute gas , one of them is the presence of an effecive mean - field term .",
    "thus , in landau s approach , at least part of the force which is exerted on a particle by the other constituents of a many - body system can be approximated by an effective mean field .",
    "another important feature of the landau kinetic equation is the introduction of an effective mass for quasiparticles , however here we neglect the difference between bare and effective mass .",
    "landau s kinetic equation allows also for a collision term which , nonetheless , in some cases may be neglected ( see for example sect .",
    "4 of @xcite ) .",
    "when this is done , we are dealing with a collisionless kinetic equation in the mean field approximation .",
    "such an approximation had been considered long ago by jeans ( who gave the credit to boltzmann ) in the context of stellar dynamics @xcite and later by vlasov in that of plasma physics @xcite . here",
    "we follow the use that has become common both in plasma and nuclear physics and refer to the collisionless kinetic equation in the mean field approximation as the vlasov equation ( see @xcite for a discussion of historical priorities ) .",
    "kirzhnitz and collaborators @xcite extended the approach to non homogeneous systems and used it to study the possibility of collective excitations in the electron cloud of heavy atoms .",
    "they pointed out that a main difficulty arising in finite systems concerns the boundary conditions to be imposed on the fluctuations of the phase - space - density .",
    "moreover these authors also derived an interesting expression for the polarization propagator determining the linear response of these systems .",
    "unfortunately the practical usefulness of this expression is limited to rather special systems in which the constituents move along closed orbits .",
    "another attempt to study the dynamic response of inhomogeneous fermi systems was limited to one - dimensional problems @xcite .",
    "bertsch @xcite argued that the vlasov equation could be used as a starting point for a semiclassical theory of giant resonances in heavy nuclei .",
    "he pointed out that , in spite of being a classical equation of motion , this equation would not violate the pauli principle , at least in a semiclassical sense .",
    "this is a consequence of the liouville theorem . when applying this method to nuclei , however , one is faced with the problem of finite - size effects since a nucleon close to the fermi surface is more likely to reach the nuclear surface than to suffer a violent collision with another nucleon .",
    "therefore finite - size effects become more important than the collision integral and also in the case of nuclei it is reasonable to study the kinetic equation in the mean - field ( or vlasov ) approximation , at least as a first step .",
    "some remarkable progress on this problem has been made in the field of galactic dynamics : polyacenko and shukhman @xcite solved the linearized vlasov equation for finite spherical systems in their study of the stability of collisionless stellar systems . in this context one of the main problems",
    "is that of determining a stable equilibrium distribution of particles ( stars ) .",
    "small deviations from the equilibrium distribution are characterized by eigenfrequencies that are purely imaginary in the case of unstable systems .",
    "their approach has found several applications in the field @xcite .",
    "a similar solution of the linearized vlasov equation for nuclear response has been derived independently in @xcite .",
    "this solution turns out to agree with that of @xcite and gives a reasonable description of giant resonances in heavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "abrosimov , di toro and strutinsky @xcite used the same approach within a sharp - surface model in which the nuclear mean field is approximated by a square - well potential and used also different ( moving - surface ) boundary conditions in order to extend the approach of @xcite to low - energy surface vibrations in heavy nuclei .",
    "this paper is a review of work done in the last ten years , based on the approaches of @xcite and @xcite . in sect .",
    "2 both approaches are recalled , while in sect .",
    "3 several applications of the theory to the study of isoscalar vibrations of different multipolarity ( monopole , dipole , quadrupole , octupole ) in heavy nuclei are discussed . finally , in sect .",
    "4 , conclusions are drawn .",
    "the two appendices contain some more technical material on the moving - surface response functions and on the fourier coefficients that replace the quantum matrix elements in our semiclassical approach .",
    "in our semiclassical approach we assume that a ( heavy ) spherical nucleus in its ground state can be described by the following equilibrium phase - space - distribution ] [ eqd ] f_0(*r*,*p*)=(_f - h_0(*r * , * p*))=f(h_0 ) , where @xmath0 is the step function , @xmath1 is the fermi energy , while [ qpe ] h_0(*r*,*p*)=+v_0(r)=is the quasiparticle energy and the equilibrium mean field @xmath2 is assumed to be spherical . in principle",
    "the mean field should be determined self - consistently as ( hartree approximation ) [ eqmf ] v_0(*r*)=d*r* v(*r*,*r*)_0(*r* ) , where @xmath3 is the effective interaction between quasiparticles and [ eqden ] _ 0(*r*)=d*p*f_0(*r*,*p * ) the equilibrium density of the nucleus ( for sake of simplicity we do not take into account explicitly the spin and isospin degrees of freedom since this would only complicate the formalism without posing any new conceptual difficulty ; the statistical weight @xmath4 in eq.([eqd ] ) accounts for these degrees of freedom ) . in practice",
    "we shall use instead a phenomenological equilibrium mean field , which can be either of the saxon - woods shape or even a simple square - well potential of radius @xmath5 . for the square - well approximation ,",
    "several expressions can be evaluated analytically and this is one of the merits of our simplified approach .",
    "note that , contrary to the standard fermi liquid theory , our equilibrium distribution ( [ eqd ] ) depends also on the space coordinate @xmath6 .",
    "next we assume that at time @xmath7 the system is subject to an external driving field of the kind [ vext ] v^ext(*r*,t)=(t)q(*r * ) . here",
    "@xmath8 is a parameter determining the intensity of the external force , which is applied only for a very short time around @xmath7 , as described by the dirac @xmath9-function , and @xmath10 gives the space dependence of the external field .",

    "the response of the system to an external force is described by the fluctuation of the phase - space density defined by [ flu ] f(*r*,*p*,t)=f_0(*r*,*p*)+f(*r*,*p*,t ) or , equivalently , by its time fourier transform [ fft ] f(*r*,*p*,)=_-^ dt e^it f(*r*,*p * , t ) .",

    "this expression shows explicitly that the extra force acting on a particle in the perturbed system has two components : one due to the external driving field @xmath18 and an additional one due to the change in the interaction with the surrounding particles .",
    "this last term is given by [ dvint ] v^int(*r*,t)=d*r* v(*r*,*r*)d*p*f(*r* , * p*,t ) .    if the external force is sufficiently weak , the density fluctuation induced by it is small and we can consider only terms that are linear in @xmath8 . in this case",

    "( [ dvint ] ) ) containing partial derivatives with respect to time and to the six variables @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the time derivative can be eliminated by using the fourier transform ( [ fft ] ) , while the properties of poisson brackets suggest that some simplification might be achieved simply by making a change of variables to generalized coordinates and momenta .",
    "the new coordinates should be chosen in such a way to include the maximum number of constants of motion of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath23 so that the corresponding variable will not contribute to the poisson bracket .",
    "for motion in a central force field a convenient set of generalized coordinates is ( @xmath24 ) , where @xmath25 is the particle energy ( [ qpe ] ) , @xmath26 the magnitude of its angular momentum , @xmath27 the radial coordinate , and @xmath28 the euler angles associated with the rotation of the frame of cartesian coordinates necessary to align the @xmath29-axis of the lab frame to the particle angular momentum @xmath30 and the @xmath31-axis of the lab frame with the @xmath6 vector specifying the instantaneous position of a particle with respect to the force centre ( see fig .",

    "it has already been pointed out in @xcite that this approximation gives a very reasonable description of the position ( including the @xmath115-dependence ) of the isoscalar giant monopole resonance in heavy nuclei .",
    "another interesting feature of the monopole response pointed out in @xcite is that the zero - order strength function vanishes for @xmath116 .",
    "as a consequence of this fact , within this model , there is no landau damping of the collective monopole mode .",
    "this absence of landau damping is in qualitative agreement with the results of analogous quantum calculations @xcite . the very small width appearing in fig .",
    "2 is due to our use of a fnite value of the infinitesimal parameter @xmath117 ( for numerical reasons , we have used @xmath118 mev ) .",

    "2 exhausts about 99% of the monopole energy - weighted sum rule , which is given by @xcite [ ewsr0 ] _ 0^ dees(e)=ar^2 .",
    "it is well known that the mean - field approximation violates the translation invariance of the nuclear hamiltonian and that this results in the appearing of spurious strength in the isoscalar dipole response .",
    "hence the isoscalar dipole channel , excited by the external field ( [ mul ] ) with @xmath119 , is usually not interesting because it should correspond to a simple translation of an unexcited nucleus , while in the mean - field approximation this pure translation is replaced by a spurious excitation of the nuclear centre of mass bound by an unphysical force .",
    "however the corresponding compression mode , excited by the field [ mul2 ] q(*r*)=r^3 y_1m(*r * ) , has received considerable attention because of the possibility of obtaining from it additional information about the compressibility of nuclear matter @xcite . since the external field ( [ mul2 ] )",
    "can excite also the centre of mass , the problem of subtracting the unwanted spurious strength from the corresponding response function has usually been dealt with by using an ingenious trick due to van giai and sagawa @xcite .",
    "these authors suggested that , instead of studying the response to the external field ( [ mul2 ] ) , one should look at the response to an effective external field of the kind [ effef ] q_eff(*r * ) = ( r^3-r)y_1m(*r * ) , where @xmath120 is a parameter determined by the condition that , under the action of the external force , the centre of mass should remain at rest .",

    "it is clear from the expression ( [ rfp ] ) of the restoring - force parameter @xmath91 that this parameter vanishes for @xmath119 .",
    "this means that in this case there is no restoring force , hence the moving - surface boundary condition seems to be able to readjust the translation symmetry that is broken by the mean - field approximation .",

    "this collisionless equation , which has been initially derived for other systems , can be applied also to nuclei because in nuclear matter the mean - free - path of nucleons close to the fermi surface is larger than the typical nuclear dimensions .",
    "this fact has two consequences :    *   the mean - field approximation is a reasonable one in the study of low - energy nuclear response , *   finite size effects are important and should be taken into account .    hence , because of the interplay between nucleon mean - free - path and nuclear dimensions , the vlasov equation can be used to study the nuclear response to a weak driving field of long wavelength .",

    "these boundary conditions are authomatically enforced by the requirement that the wave function of bound states decreases exponentially outside the system , in the semiclassical kinetic - equation approach there is no similar requirement and the boundary conditions satisfied by the phase - space - density fluctuations must be imposed by using some reasonable criterion .",
    "here we have studied the small fluctuations of the phase - space - density induced by applying a weak external driving force to spherical nuclei and have assumed a sharp - surface model for the spatial density and mean field in heavy nuclei .",
    "then we have compared the experimental isoscalar strength functions with those calculated by imposing two different kinds of boundary conditions on the phase - space - density fluctuations : fixed- and moving - surface boundary conditions . on the whole",
    "we find a better qualitative agreement with experiment for the moving - surface response .    as a final comment ,",
