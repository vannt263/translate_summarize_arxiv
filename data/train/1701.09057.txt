    "in the past decade , with introducing smart phones , tablets and other advanced mobile devices , wireless cellular networks have been developed . moreover ,",
    "the global data traffic is predicted to increase 11-fold from 2013 to 2018 and reaching 15.9 exabytes per month .",
    "consequently , increasing the mobile data traffic is created challenges for cellular network operators ( cnos ) @xcite .",
    "social media has already exceeded 50 percent of global mobile data traffic in content transportation of internet in 2012 @xcite . to satisfy the tremendous growing mobile data traffic demand , developers have to increase cellular network capacity and backhaul bandwidth , simultaneously .",
    "moreover , developing small cells is a potential solution to approach shannon limit in lte standard @xcite .    in radio access networks (",
    "rans ) using radio resources , inter - cell interference ( ici ) level is growing .",
    "therefore , it needs to be imposed more control signals like transmit power control and interference alignment on long term evolution ( lte ) systems , where a significant amount of available bandwidth is considered by the mentioned control signals @xcite .",
    "a more practical metric than quality of service ( qos ) is quality of experience ( qoe ) , specifically latency which can be improved by merely increasing wireless channel capacity via radio spectrum .",
    "according to confined available radio spectrum and more expensive bandwidth of backhaul links , increasing wireless capacity is not a sufficient solution to decrease latency @xcite .",
    "orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) is a modulation technique which is considered in many communication networks , such as lte cellular networks to increase the data sum - rate of the network . in ofdm ,",
    "the available bandwidth is divided into some more smaller bandwidth which are called subcarriers @xcite . for more flexibility in resource allocation ( ra ) , we develop orthogonal frequency division multiple access ( ofdma ) technique in which separated sets of subcarriers are assigned to different mobile users ( mus ) @xcite .    in the current lte system",
    ", social media should travel from data centers to base stations ( bss ) and finally to the end - users .",
    "travelling data over the network takes a time called latency .",
    "since the other solution for reducing latency is closing data to the end - users , we should not solely concentrate our attentions to radio resources ( i.e. , subcarriers and transmit powers ) , but also to the storage ( i.e. , caching ) in cellular networks @xcite . caching which means using the storage capacity , is another resource which can be simply imposed in lte system to improve qoe , particularly , latency @xcite . since the delay of achieving social media to mus mainly comes from radio access and core networks , decreasing the data traffic of radio access and backhaul links , simultaneously ,",
    "is an effective approach to reduce the latency @xcite .",
    "recently , some joint radio ra algorithms have been proposed for the downlink of cellular ofdma - based networks @xcite .",
    "a joint subcarrier and transmit power allocation algorithm for the downlink of an ofdma mixed femtocell / macrocell network is considered in @xcite . moreover ,",
    "several fractional programming algorithms are proposed to solve the joint transmit power and subcarrier allocation in the downlink of ofdma systems @xcite    caching popular contents in the storage of the cache - enabled wireless networks is classified into two categories .",
    "the first category is considering a scenario , where each mu has access to at most one storage capacity and a cache placement optimization problem is considered for caching the popular contents in the storage of all existed caches .",
    "the second category is considering a multi - coverage scenario in which each mu is covered by several caches . in the second scenario ,",
    "the authors study on the optimal cache placement with a larger distributed cache . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors studied on a distributed caching in downlink of the heterogeneous cellular networks ( hcns ) , where mus can choose the optimal cache .",
    "hence , they designed distributed caching optimization algorithms via belief propagation ( bp ) for minimizing the latency . for reducing complexity of the proposed bp",
    ", the authors proposed a heuristic bp algorithm and investigate the average downloading delay of the network .",
    "an optimal caching with different storage of caches can be considered in a hcn @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that considering an optimal content placement is more better than caching the popular contents everywhere @xcite . moreover , in @xcite , the authors proposed an in - network cache assisted enodeb caching scheme for lte networks , where content objects are cached at enodebs while delay reduction is maximized .",
    "they also showed that considering caching scheme in the networks can save bandwidth for mobile operators and reduce the downloading delay for end - users .",
    "moreover , in @xcite , the authors study on a single - cell scenario in lte system with considering d2d communication and formulate the data traffic of the social media in the radio access , core , and d2d communication networks and find the optimal content placement in the cache of the bs and mus .",
    "they show that finding the optimal content placement more improves the latency , in contrast of caching most popular contents .",
    "moreover , they assumed a log - normal distribution for the social media size and a fixed data rate for both the access and d2d links .",
    "our contributions are presented as follows :    * we consider a cache - enabled ofdma multi - cell network in which the bss can cache the social media in the network .",
    "we focus on downlink of the backhaul and access links . * in the considered model , bss can cache social media and serve the requests of mus . moreover , in each cell , mus can request the social media only from the associated bs , and the requests of mus could be served in two cases based on the existence of the social media in the storage of the bss . for decreasing the downloading delay of mus",
    ", we can decrease the data traffic of both the access and backhaul links and increase the data rate of mus , simultaneously .",
    "in contrast to previous works , this paper considers a new viewpoint in which the joint cache and radio resources is jointly optimized .",
    "we note that there is not any work that considers jointly optimizing cache and radio resources . * in this system , we propose two schemes with different objective functions and the same constraints . in the first scheme , we minimize the total delay of mus exists in the network and the second one is a fairness - aware scheme , in which the maximum delay of mus is minimized , subject to the transmit power , delivery deadline and storage capacity constraints and obtain the near - optimal transmit powers , subcarrier assignment and content placement indicators which are considered as our optimization variables . *",
    "we propose iterative algorithms to solve the proposed optimization problems .",
    "specifically , in each iteration , we divide each main problem into two subproblems , where the first subproblem is content placement problem and the second subproblem is joint transmit power and subcarrier allocation problem .",
    "we solve the binary linear programming ( blp ) content placement problems via optimization toolboxes , such as cvx with the internal solver mosek . in each problem , the joint transmit power and subcarrier allocation problem can be classified as general linear fractional programming ( glfp ) .",
    "accordingly , we use the fractional programming algorithm to solve it which is known as dinkelbach method .",
    "we also show that there exist equivalent objective function in subtractive form for each objective function .",
    "then , we solve the mixed - integer nonlinear programming ( minlp ) joint transmit power and subcarrier allocation subproblem in the first problem with the equivalent objective function using the lagrangian dual decomposition approach .",
    "we repeat these iterations until more improvement is not made . on the other hand ,",
    "the joint transmit power and subcarrier allocation optimization problem in the fairness - aware scheme with the equivalent objective function is classified as geometric programming ( gp ) which has more computational complexity .",
    "hence , we transform the prior subproblem into gp - based form and solve it iteratively using gp optimization toolboxes such as cvx . *",
    "we mathematically prove that the propose iterative algorithms converge to a near - optimal solution .",
    "the mathematically proof of the convergence of the considered fractional algorithm is also discussed in this paper .",
    "moreover , we mathematically prove that the time - sharing condition is always holds in our model , when the total number of subcarriers increases . hence , when the total number of subcarriers tends to infinity , the duality gap between the near - optimal and global - optimal solution of the lagrange dual decomposition approach tends to zero .",
    "* we also investigate the the effect of joint optimizing content placement and radio resources on decreasing the downloading delay of mus .",
    "we show that when the popular social media are stored in the cache of the bss or when the popular social media are closer to mus , the downloading delay of mus decreases .",
    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows : we describe the system model of the considered network in section [ section system model ] . in section [ section the main optimization problem ] , we propose the main optimization problems of the network .",
    "moreover , in section [ section solution ] , we solve the proposed problems via iterative algorithms .",
    "furthermore , the numerical results and simulations are presented in section [ section simulations ] .",
    "we also present the conclusion of this paper in section [ section conclusion ] .",

    "we also assume a fixed available radio spectrum with the non - spanning frequency band of bandwidth @xmath28 and @xmath29 for all wireless backhaul and access links , respectively .",
    "we also divide the bandwidth of wireless backhaul and access links into @xmath30 and @xmath31 orthogonal subcarriers , respectively , such that each subcarrier has @xmath32 band of bandwidth which is much less than the available coherence bandwidth of entire network and the transmitted signal over each subcarrier may experience flat fading @xcite .",
