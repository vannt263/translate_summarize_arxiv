    "bl lacertae objects are a rare type of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) characterized by strong and variable emission of non - thermal radiation across the entire electromagnetic spectrum , from radio waves to high energy @xmath4-rays . in three cases ( mkn 421 : punch et al .",
    "1992 ; mkn 501 : quinn et al . 1996",
    "; 1es 2344 + 514 : catanese et al . , 1998 )",
    "the emission has been detected up to tev energies .",
    "bl lacertae objects comprise the most violent ( highly and rapidly variable , highly polarized ) and most elusive ( extremely difficult to find in optical surveys ) sources amongst agn . unlike most other agn they do not show evidence ( by definition ) for strong emission lines or large infra - red or uv excesses . the emission from radio to @xmath4-rays",
    "can be explained as due to synchrotron radiation up to a certain maximum frequency ( that ranges approximately from @xmath5 to @xmath6 hz ) , above which a sharp turnover occurs until a second component due to compton scattered radiation dominates , making these objects detectable up to the highest energies so far accessible ( see e.g. , ulrich , maraschi and urry , 1997 ) .",
    "the extreme properties of bl lacs require that the matter emitting the radiation moves at relativistic speeds in the direction of the observer .",
    "the spectral change from synchrotron to compton radiation is crucial for the understanding of the physics of bl lacs .",
    "however , up to now this has been inferred only from the comparison of x - ray measurements carried out with different instruments and very often at different epochs . the wide energy band of  offers for the brightest objects the best opportunity to directly detect without ambiguity this spectral change and to study the x - ray spectra at the same epoch over a large interval .    to this end",
    "we have undertaken a program that aims at studying in detail the x - ray spectrum of a large and well defined subsample of soft x - ray selected bl lacs .",
    "this sample includes mostly objects that are expected to show strong spectral curvature and spectral breaks , since the synchrotron break should occur just before or in the  band .",
    "we aim at measuring in detail the shape of the most energetic part of the synchrotron emission , and trying to establish where and how the compton component becomes dominant .",
    "we also intend to look for the correlation between spectral slope and break energy found in rosat data ( padovani @xmath7 giommi , 1996 ; lamer , brunner & staubert , 1996 ) .",

[ figseda ] we plot the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of our sources , reporting the  spectral fits and the nearly simultaneous optical data when available ( filled symbols ) , and other data from the literature ( open symbols or upper limits ; references are listed in table  [ tab : ref ] ) . as can be seen , the sed of the objects in our sample are characterized by a smooth distribution , rising ( in @xmath8 ) from the radio to the optical - uv and x - ray bands .",
    "variability is evident , especially in the most often observed objects .",
    "many objects show a fall off at high energies . in order to obtain a reliable estimate of the peak energy ,",

    "for the other bands ( i.e. , radio and ir  none of these sources has been detected in @xmath4-rays ) we used the maximum observed value : variability amplitudes are not large in these bands and so should not affect significantly the results . from the fitted polynomial we derive the peak frequency of the sed @xmath10 .",
    "three of the sources in this sample have been studied also by sambruna et al .",

    "note , however , that their figure 4 shows that the peak of the emission for ms0317.0 + 1834 is indeed at higher energies , in agreement with our value .",
    "note also that the optical simultaneous observations constrain @xmath10 in a much better way .",
    "figure  [ figaln ] shows the spectral indices derived from the lecs / mecs fit ( from table  [ fit ] ) vs. log @xmath10 .",
    "we include also the data for the objects studied by comastri et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , which are 9 lbl ( crosses ) and 3 hbl ( empty circles ) .",
    "these latter points are derived from rosat observation and so sample the spectra at slightly lower energy .",
    "a program is underway to observe a sample of bl lacs extracted from the 1 jy sample ( padovani et al .",
    "1998 and in preparation ) . when a sizable sample of lbl will be observed by ,",
    "a more direct comparison will be possible .",
    "for the hbl objects there is a good anti - correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath10 ( correlation probability = 95% ) .",
    "the solid line represents the linear regression obtained with the 10 objects observed by  using the ols bisector method ( isobe et al .",
    "the same - epoch data used for most sources , that remove the uncertainty due to variation for the determination of @xmath10 , are important in order to obtain such a tight correlation .",
    "the lbl are less correlated ( correlation probability @xmath13 ) .",
    "the behavior of @xmath2 with @xmath10 , illustrated in figure  [ figaln ] , reflects the large range of frequencies at which the synchrotron peak is observed to lie .",
    "this picture is consistent with the one proposed by padovani and giommi ( 1996 ) using rosat data , in which hbl are characterized by a synchrotron peak located in the euv / x  ray band : the x  ray radiation is therefore produced by the synchrotron process . according to the exact location of @xmath10 , the x  ray spectrum changes , being flat ( @xmath14 ) in extreme hbl objects ( where @xmath10 lies in the x  ray band ) , and steeper as the peak migrates to the uv band . in lbl objects",
    "@xmath10 has moved in the optical - ir band and the x  ray band is dominated by the flat inverse compton spectrum .    in figure  [ figarx ]",
    "we plot for both these ten hbl with  data and the comastri et al .",
    "( 1995 ) objects the relationship between @xmath15 and log @xmath10 .",
    "we add the linear regression obtained using the ols bisector method with the  data only ( solid line ) and extrapolated down to the lbl region ( dotted line ) , besides the constant @xmath15 ( horizontal dashed line ) derived following padovani & giommi ( 1995 ) ( see their figure 12 ) .",
    "the hbl points are correlated at the 98% level , indicating a link between the two quantities , while the lbl points are consistent both with the extrapolation of the regression , or with the constant value for @xmath15 suggested by padovani & giommi ( 1995 ) , in the hypothesis that for lbl the x - ray flux is proportional to the radio flux .",
    "again , it will be indeed interesting to compare these results with those obtained for lbl with  data ( padovani et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "we have analyzed the spectra for 10 x - ray selected bl lacs observed with the narrow field instruments on board the  satellite .",
    "the sources are detected from @xmath16 up to @xmath1 10 kev ( and in one case up to @xmath17 kev with the pds instrument ) with a very smooth appearance .",
    "the spectrum is generally well fitted by either a single power law , or by a broken convex power law that most probably represents the steepening after the synchrotron peak , whose position is determined also by using simultaneous optical observations .",
    "variability is not present during the short  exposure ; analysis of rosat data shows for most of the sources little variability ( within @xmath18 ) with respect to the  flux and spectral indices consistent with the  ones .",
    "the spectral energy distributions , which include literature data , instead show variability in all bands .    the x - ray spectral indices @xmath2 range between 1 and 1.5 with a flat distribution and a mean value @xmath19 .",
    "the scatter in the distribution is due to an anti - correlation we have found between @xmath2 and the frequency of the peak of the emission , @xmath10 .",
    "this extends to the  band a correlation which had been discovered in the rosat band for this class of objects .",
    "the fact that sources with harder x - ray spectra have higher @xmath10 is expected if the  band is still dominated by synchrotron emission , which is also consistent with the spectral energy distributions of our bl lacs .",
    "furthermore , we have no evidence of a spectral flattening ( indicating the arising of the compton component ) in the present spectra , but future pds detections , that are possible with exposure times slightly longer than those obtained here , might help in this respect .    the large fraction ( at least 2 out of 10 ) of hbl selected in the soft x - ray band found with a flat ( @xmath20 ) x - ray slope ( i.e. , they are near the peak of the synchrotron emission ) and the distribution of @xmath2 values support the view that objects with even higher spectral peaks in their quiescent status indeed exist , and might be found in large numbers if we devise the correct strategy ( e.g. , samples at harder x - rays , tev sources , etc . )    moreover , these sources are good candidates to be tev _",
    "emitters_. in fact , in the sources with the flattest @xmath2 the peak of the synchrotron component is localized in the soft x  ray range .",
    "electrons emitting at 1 kev by the synchrotron process have lorentz factors @xmath21 ,",
    "where @xmath22 hz , @xmath23 is the value of the magnetic field in gauss and @xmath24 is the usual doppler factor . through the inverse compton mechanism",
    ", they can emit up to @xmath25 gev .",
    "if the magnetic and radiation energy densities are equal ( as it is , approximately , in the three bl lacs already detected in the tev band ) , the flux level of the synchrotron and inverse compton peaks is roughly equal .",
    "low redshift sources are therefore good candidates to be _ detected _ in the gev ",
    "tev band , while the high energy emission of the more distant sources could be absorbed in @xmath4@xmath4 interactions with the background ir photon field , whose intensity is still uncertain .",
    "indeed , a cutoff in the high energy spectrum could be used to determine the ir background ( see , e.g. stecker & de jager , 1997 ) .",
    "this  project is still ongoing .",
    "we expect therefore to increase considerably the sample of soft x - ray selected bl lacs for which we measure the spectrum in the 0.2 - 10 kev range and possibly above . with a larger complete sample , and combining the results with other complementary  projects , we expect to be able to draw a clearer picture of the relationship between the local x - ray slope and the overall energy distribution of this class of sources , in order to derive firmer conclusions on the behaviour at hard x - ray energies and on the mechanisms of the emission .",
