    "early recognition that the heavy elements abundance patterns in extremely metal - poor stars ( [ fe / h ]  @xmath63.0 dex ) involve only r - process products ( truran 1981 ) led to the view that r - process nucleosynthesis must be associated with the environments provided by the evolution of massive stars ( @xmath7  10 m@xmath8 ) .",

    "this was due to the adoption of an inhomogeneous chemical evolution model , dropping the instantaneous mixing approximation ( i.m.a . ) in the early galactic evolutionary phases .",

    "( 2009 ) paper it was shown that the effect of the fountains is also to delay the chemical enrichment , thus breaking the i.m.a .. however , it was found that even a delay of several hundreds million years would not change the chemical results for the evolution of the galactic disc , thus supporting i.m.a .. on the other hand , inhomogeneities in the ism could be important in the early evolutionary phases , during halo formation . in this respect , there are conflicting results : on one hand it is found a very little spread in abundance ratios of many elements down to [ fe / h]=-4.0 dex , on the other hand a large spread is observed in abundance ratios involving s- and r - process elements relative to fe . in fact , the data for europium show a large spread at low metallicities : the interpretation of this spread , however , can be related more to the different stellar producers of these elements rather than to a less efficient mixing ( see cescutti et al .",

    "however , the classical site for the production of r - process elements , namely sneii , has been recently questioned ( e.g. arcones et al . 2007 ) while the r - process production in cbm seems a very robust result ( e.g. korobkin et al . 2012 ) .",
    "we have computed the evolution of the eu abundance in the milky way under several assumptions : i ) eu is produced only in cbm ; ii ) eu is produced only in snii explosions ; iii ) eu is produced both in cbm and snii explosions .      to include the production of eu from coalescence of neutron stars galactic chemical evolution model we need to define the following quantities :    1 .   the realization probability for cbm , @xmath43 ; 2 .   the time delay between the formation of the double neutron star system and the merging event , @xmath44 ; 3 .",
    "the amount of eu produced during the merging event , @xmath45 .      in our model , the rate of cbm at the time @xmath21 is computed under the assumption that the rate of formation of double neutron star systems , which will eventually coalesce , is a fraction @xmath43 of the neutron star formation rate at the time @xmath46 : @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49  m@xmath2 are the canonical lower and upper masses , at birth , which can leave a neutron star as a remnant",

    "stars with @xmath7 30  m@xmath2 probably leave black holes as remnants but the situation is quite uncertain and depends on the assumed rate of mass loss in massive stars and its dependence upon stellar metallicity ( e.g. meynet & maeder , 2002a , b ) .",
    "the value of the parameter @xmath43 is chosen by imposing that equation  ( 3 ) reproduces the present - time rate of neutron star merging in the galaxy .",
    "several observational estimates of this rate appeared in the literature ( van den heuvel & lorimer 1996 ; kalogera & lorimer 2000 ; belczynsky et al .",

    "most of the models predict eu solar abundances in agreement with the observed one .",

    "[ fig : gradb ] we show cases with eu production from both neutron stars and sneii .",
    "both scenarios can account reasonably well for the observed gradient of europium in the milky way disc .",
    "this is because the gradient depends on the mechanism of formation of the disc , here assumed to be the inside - out one .",
    "this mechanism was suggested by matteucci & franois ( 1989 ) and proven to be valid also in semi - analytical models ( e.g. pilkington et al .",
    "what it changes in figs  [ fig : grad ] and [ fig : gradb ] is the absolute value of the eu abundance , [ eu / h ] , as due to the different assumptions made on the eu producers . in this case , the models with both sneii and cbm as eu producers produce the best agreement with the data ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : gradb ] ) .",
    "in this paper we have studied the production of eu and assumed that this element can be produced in both compact binary mergers ( cbm ) and sneii . to do that , we have adopted a very detailed chemical evolution model which can predict the evolution of the abundances of many species and that already reproduces the behaviour of several abundances as well as the main features of the solar neighbourhood and the whole disc .",
    "our attention has been focused here on the production of eu by cbm and whether this production alone can explain the solar abundance of eu as well as the [ eu / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] relation .",

    "our main conclusions can be summarized as follows :    * cbm can be entirely responsible for eu production in the galaxy if the ns systems all have a coalescence time scale no longer than 1 myr , a possibility suggested by belczynski et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , each event produces at least 3  @xmath0 10@xmath1  m@xmath2 of eu and all stars with masses in the range 950  m@xmath2 leave a ns as a remnant . in this case",
    "we can well reproduce the average trend of [ eu / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] in the solar vicinity as well as the eu solar abundance . in this case",
    ", there is no need for sneii producing eu .",
    "however , all the uncertainties in these parameters plus the uncertain observed rate of cbm in the galaxy at the present time , induce some caution in drawing firm conclusions . *",
    "perhaps , a more realistic situation would be the one where both cbm and sneii are producing eu . the best model in this case requires that cbm can produce 2  @xmath0 10@xmath1  m@xmath2 of eu and the delay times can be various , spanning between 10 and 100 myr .",
    "sneii should then produce eu in the range 2050  m@xmath2 with yields of the order of 10@xmath310@xmath4  m@xmath2 of eu per supernova .",
    "it is very important to have high stellar masses to produce the eu observed at very low metallicity . * both models with eu produced only by cbm and models with cbm and sne can reproduce the eu abundance gradient observed along the galactic thin disc .",
    "our conclusions are different from those of argast et al .",
    "( 2004 ) who concluded that cbm can not be the only eu producers .",
    "we think that this is due to the fact that argast et al.s model does not assume instantaneous mixing in the early galactic evolutionary phases .",
    "this fact leads to an additional delay in the appearence of eu in the ism , besides the delay for the merging of the two ns , and is probably the reason why their predicted [ eu / fe ] appears at a too high [ fe / h ] values relative to observations . on the other hand",
    ", the assumption that the ism was not well mixed at early times can explain the large spread observed in the r- and s - process abundances relative to fe at low metallicity .",
    "however , such a large spread is not observed for other abundance ratios at the same metallicity .",
    "therefore , either the spread is explained as due to different stellar producers of different elements as suggested in cescutti et al .",
    "( 2006 , 2013 ) or the spread is related to observational errors .",
    "inhomogeneous mixing , in fact , should act on all the elements .",
    "our model assumes instantaneous mixing approximation ( i.m.a . )",
    "and therefore it can not reproduce the observed spread but just the average trends .    on the other hand , de donder & vanbeveren ( 2003 ) , using a model similar to this one with i.m.a .",
    ", taken from chiappini et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and computing population synthesis binary models , explored several cases of mergers : ns / ns and ns / black hole .",
    "they concluded that mergers ns / black hole can produce enough eu by themselves but they did not test the case of eu production from sneii .",
    "more recently , mennekens & vanbeveren ( 2013 ) , adopting again a population synthesis model and a galactic model like in de donder & vanbeveren ( 2003 ) , reached a conclusion similar to that of the present paper : the cbm can account for the entire r - process production except in the first 100 myr , but they did not include the contribution from sneii .",
    "therefore , although firm conclusions on the nature of eu can not be yet drawn , this subject should be pursued by testing the various hypothesis discussed here in a model which takes into account early inhomogeneities as well as a distribution function of the delay times for the merging of neutron stars , and that will be the subject of a forthcoming paper .",

    "<S> we have explored the eu production in the milky way by means of a very detailed chemical evolution model . in particular , we have assumed that eu is formed in merging neutron star ( or neutron star black hole ) binaries as well as in type ii supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> we have tested the effects of several important parameters influencing the production of eu during the merging of two neutron stars , such as : i ) the time scale of coalescence , ii ) the eu yields and iii ) the range of initial masses for the progenitors of the neutron stars . </S>",
    "<S> the yields of eu from type ii supernovae are very uncertain , more than those from coalescing neutron stars , so we have explored several possibilities . we have compared our model results with the observed rate of coalescence of neutron stars , the solar eu abundance , the [ eu / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] relation in the solar vicinity and the [ eu / h ] gradient along the galactic disc . </S>",
    "<S> our main results can be summarized as follows : i ) neutron star mergers can be entirely responsible for the production of eu in the galaxy if the coalescence time scale is no longer than 1  myr for the bulk of binary systems , the eu yield is around 3  @xmath0 10@xmath1  m@xmath2 , and the mass range of progenitors of neutron stars is 950  m@xmath2 ; ii ) both type ii supernovae and merging neutron stars can produce the right amount of eu if the neutron star mergers produce 2  @xmath0 10@xmath1  m@xmath2 per system and type ii supernovae , with progenitors in the range 2050  m@xmath2 , produce yields of eu of the order of 10@xmath310@xmath4  m@xmath2 ; iii ) either models with only neutron stars producing eu or mixed ones can reproduce the observed eu abundance gradient along the galactic disc .    </S>",
