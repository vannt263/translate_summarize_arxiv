    "the details of the host galaxy imaging and surface brightness decompositions are described by @xcite , but we include a short summary of the relevant details here .",
    "the majority of the objects in the reverberation sample were imaged with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) high resolution channel ( hrc ) through the f550 m filter . unfortunately , acs ceased functioning before the observations were completed , so five objects ( pg0026 , pg1307 , pg1426 , pg1617 , and mrk509 ) were imaged with the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) through the f547 m filter .",
    "exposure times for all observations were graduated so that the saturated pixels in the nucleus region of the long exposures could be corrected using an unsaturated image . after correcting saturated pixels and cleaning cosmic rays , individual images were co - added and corrected for distortion if necessary .",
    "the surface brightness profiles of the agn host galaxies were modeled with the two - dimensional image decomposition program galfit @xcite . to avoid overcorrecting the agn luminosities for host galaxy starlight",
    ", we made conservative host galaxy model fits which may somewhat underestimate the true brightness of the various galaxy components .    for most of the reverberation - mapped objects ,",
    "the _ hst _ images are sufficient for a full decomposition .",
    "however , for the nearby and spatially - extended ngc objects in the sample , the _ hst _ images do not provide the necessary wide field of view ( fov ) to measure the sky background , which affects the accuracy to which we can constrain the bulge and disk parameters .",
    "our current surface brightness models for the _ hst _ images of the ngc galaxies include components that can not be resolved in the ground - based images due to their small effective radii ( < 3.5  in all cases ) .",
    "the typical seeing in the ground - based images of @xmath64  blurs the central psf together with these compact components and with the bulge itself , which has an effective radius of only @xmath65  for these objects .",
    "the difficulties in disentangling the nuclear structure in the ground - based images and the fact that the distortion - corrected hrc fov is , at best , only twice the effective radius of the bulge and furthermore does nt allow measurement of the sky , creates enough uncertainty in the bulge parameters for the ngc objects with reverberation masses that we exclude them from further analysis at this time .",
    "additional images with an intermediate fov are necessary to fully constrain the decompositions of these galaxies .",
    "we also exclude ic4329a because of its uncertain black hole mass and because it is a dusty edge - on galaxy with an unreliable surface brightness decomposition .",
    "table  1 lists the 26 objects examined by this paper .",
    "the parameters of the surface brightness decompositions are included in @xcite .",
    "we take the component with the largest effective radius ( other than any exponential disk component ) as the `` bulge '' for each of these galaxies , except for mrk79 where there is clearly an extended bar - like component . for ellipticals ,",
    "the bulge magnitude is the total galaxy magnitude .",
    "we followed the prescriptions of @xcite for converting from the space telescope ab@xmath66 magnitude system to galactic extinction - corrected magnitudes in the vega system , which we list in table  1 as @xmath67 .",
    "the @xmath68 color for each object was calculated with _",
    "synphot _ in iraf using the bulge template of @xcite .",
    "we include in table  1 the extinction - corrected integrated bulge magnitude in the vega system for each agn host galaxy , the corresponding apparent and absolute johnson @xmath69 magnitudes , and the @xmath69-band luminosity from the standard relation @xmath70 .",
    "we assume an uncertainty of @xmath71dex for the bulge luminosities .",
    "four of the galaxies had an additional surface brightness component besides a bulge or exponential disk .",
    "imaging alone is not sufficient to ascertain whether these components contribute to the total bulge brightness or are dynamically distinct , so we also list in table  1 the bulge luminosity for those objects including the contribution from the additional component .",
    "figure  1 compares the ( single component ) bulge luminosities and black hole masses for the sample of objects that are common to both this work ( filled circles ) and the @xcite study ( open circles ) .",
    "there is a clear trend between black hole mass and bulge luminosity for the objects in this study , whereas the bulge luminosities from @xcite have a range of @xmath64dex in black hole mass over a limited @xmath72dex range in luminosity .",
    "it is perhaps unsurprising that a correlation is more apparent now , as the study by @xcite is a compilation of inhomogeneous data from the literature .",
    "the bulge luminosities were primarily from @xcite and include measurements from ground - based photographic plates and ccd imaging , as well as saturated and unsaturated _ hst _ imaging , all in various passbands .",
    "many of the studies included in the compilation did not use the same cosmologies and distances for the objects or the same analysis techniques in determining the black hole mass .",
    "all of the reverberation - based black hole masses have since been homogeneously analyzed and updated by @xcite , and pg2130 + 099 which has an updated mass from the analysis of a new reverberation data set by @xcite .",
    "figure  2 shows the black hole masses versus the host galaxy @xmath69-band luminosities for the full sample of 26 objects included in this study .",
    "we employed two independent fitting routines in our examination of the @xmath4 relationship : fitexy @xcite , which estimates the parameters of a straight - line fit through the data including errors in both coordinates ; and bces @xcite , which accounts for the effects of errors on both coordinates in the fit using bivariate correlated errors and a component of intrinsic scatter .",
    "fitexy numerically solves for the minimum orthogonal @xmath73 using an interative root - finding algorithm and is a `` symmetric '' algorithm in that it does not assume a dependent and independent variable . following @xcite",
    ", we include an estimate of the fractional scatter , in this case the fraction of the @xmath74 measurement value ( not the error value ) that is added in quadrature to the error value to obtain a reduced @xmath73 of 1.0 .",
    "while bces also accounts for intrinsic scatter , it does not provide a measure of it .",
    "we adopt the bootstrap of the bces bisector value with @xmath75 iterations .",
    "fits of the form    @xmath76    were performed utilizing both the single - component bulge luminosities and the multiple - component bulge luminosities and are presented in table  2 .",
    "the powerlaw slope ranges from @xmath77 to @xmath78 depending on the definition of the bulge luminosity and the specific fitting routine utilized .",
    "we take the bces fit nearest the middle of this range , with a slope of @xmath79 , as the `` best '' fit .    for comparison",
    ", we fit the quiescent galaxy @xmath80 relationship using the sample of nearby galaxies with dynamical black hole mass measurements ( @xcite ; ff05 ) .",

    "the fits presented here for the quiescent elliptical galaxies are slightly steeper than that reported by ff05 ( @xmath84 ) and are in reasonable agreement with the slope of @xmath85 for the quiescent galaxy fit reported by @xcite .",

    "the exceptions are the five objects that were imaged through the f547 m filter using wfpc2 , but the bandpass is very similar to the acs f550 m filter employed for the other objects ( @xmath88  versus @xmath89 , and @xmath90  versus @xmath91 ) .",

    "while high - quality observations do exist for these nearby and well - studied galaxies , they have not been obtained in a uniform fashion .",
    "the recent work by @xcite attempts to compensate for the different methods and analysis techniques employed in several publications ( @xcite with an updated cosmology presented in @xcite ) , all of which arrive at different values for the slope of the quiescent galaxy @xmath105 relationship and/or different black hole masses predicted for a specific bulge luminosity .",

    "interestingly , he finds a somewhat shallower slope , @xmath107 , when bulge luminosities are estimated by two - dimensional decompositions of @xmath108-band images and corrected for inclination - dependent dust extinction in the host galaxy disks .",
    "only 13 objects are included in that particular analysis ( an updated form of the study presented by @xcite ) but it is intriguing nonetheless in its close agreement with the fit that we find for the agns .    while we expect that the agn bulge luminosities in this may be slightly underestimated based on the conservative galaxy fits we employed , there is also a small @xmath109-correction introduced , as the average redshift of the 26 agns is @xmath110 .",
    "the portion of the sed observed through the medium - band @xmath69 filters employed in the _ hst _ observations is fainter ( @xmath1dex in luminosity ) than if the galaxies were at @xmath111 , assuming their stellar populations resemble that of the bulge template of @xcite .",
    "accounting for any such biases in the galaxy fitting or colors would intensify the apparent differences between the slopes measured for the agns and quiescent galaxies .",
    "the black hole masses for the agns have already been scaled so that their @xmath112 relationship is brought into agreement with the quiescent @xmath3 relationship fit to the same sample of quiescent galaxies included in the ff05 study .",
    "the differences may be mitigated if @xcite are correct in their suggestion that neglecting radiation pressure leads to systematic under - estimation of black hole masses from reverberation mapping data ( see , however , @xcite ) .",
    "a separate concern has been raised by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , who present an apparent disagreement between the quiescent galaxy @xmath3 and @xmath4 relationships and suggest that the quiescent galaxy sample is biased towards galaxies with overly large velocity dispersions for their luminosities ( see , however , @xcite who examines the role of bars in this issue ) .",
    "there is no reason to suspect the agn sample of having the same bias , as the mass measurements are made using flux variability techniques and not dynamical techniques .",
    "such a bias may help explain why some of the quiescent galaxies at the high luminosity end have black hole masses that are more than an order - of - magnitude larger than the active galaxies , although it may not completely resolve this disparity .",
    "finally , there may be no reason to expect that the @xmath105 relationship is the same for the agns and quiescent galaxies in these samples , as there is only a modest number of objects in each sample and selection effects likely play an important role on both sides @xcite .",
    "clearly , there remain several areas that are in need of investigation , any of which may shed light on the apparently inconsistent fits to the @xmath4 relationship for agns and for quiescent galaxies . as the @xmath113 relationship is an important and widely used means of estimating black hole masses throughout cosmic history ( e.g. , @xcite ) , an accurate characterization of this relationship is necessary for understanding black hole growth and evolution as well as the interplay between black holes and their host galaxies",
    "we have presented an updated version of the agn @xmath80 relationship using the database of homogeneously analyzed reverberation masses from @xcite and @xcite ( 2008 ; pg2130 + 099 ) and the two - dimensional surface brightness decompositions of the agn host galaxies described by @xcite .",
    "we find a strong correlation about the relationship for the 26 agns included here , with a best - fit powerlaw slope of @xmath79 .",
    "this is somewhat shallower than the best - fit slope for quiescent galaxies ( @xmath114 ) , even though the agn black hole masses have been scaled to bring the agn and quiescent galaxy @xmath3 relationships into agreement .",
    "there appear to be many systematics in both the agn and quiescent galaxy samples that must be investigated in order to more completely understand this important relationship .",
    "our future plans include investigating the biases in the agn sample and extending the range of the relationship for agns .",
    "we have an _ hst _ cycle 17 program to image the ngc objects that were excluded from this particular work with the wide field camera 3 through the f547 m filter",
    ". these observations will provide us with the intermediate fov images necessary for accurate decompositions of those galaxies , enabling us to include them at the low - mass end of the @xmath105 relationship for agns .",
