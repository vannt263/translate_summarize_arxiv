    "the constituent quarks of the `` naive '' , nonrelativistic quark model are universal , i.e. hadron - channel independent degrees of freedom with a flavor - dependent but otherwise constant mass . this simple concept has been refined in several relativistic quark models . usually , then , the quarks become `` dressed '' quasi - particles and their constituent mass turns into a momentum - dependent mean field or self - energy .",
    "constituent - quark masses with a different kind of momentum dependence have recently been employed for the description of diffractive vector - meson production processes in ref .",
    "guided by analogy with a nonrelativistic quark - model amplitude , the authors of @xcite model the vector polarization function in terms of a resolution - dependent quark mass ( rdqm ) @xmath0 , similar to the cutoff - dependent quark masses generated during renormalization group ( rg ) evolution @xcite of chiral quark models @xcite . since",
    "this  approach has proven quite successful in reproducing experimental data for the vector polarization amplitude , it seems worthwhile to explore its uses in a broader setting , i.e. in correlation functions of other important meson channels .",
    "this is the aim of the present note .",
    "the specific implementation of the resolution - dependent quark mass in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely as a replacement of the constant quark mass in the otherwise noninteracting correlators , lets one suspect that not the whole variety of physics in other meson channels can be captured in such a minimal way . in this regard the spin-0 correlators hold a particular challenge since their behavior can be qualitatively altered by the underlying vacuum physics .",
    "the strength of the interaction in the pseudoscalar isovector correlator , for example , gets up to two orders of magnitude larger than in the vector channel , and it sets in at smaller distances @xcite .",
    "of course , this behavior is naturally explained by the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry in the qcd vacuum and reflects the exceptionally strong attraction needed to generate almost massless goldstone pions .",
    "the pronounced differences in the behavior of the various mesonic correlators raise the question to which extent they can be described by a _ universal _ resolution ( and flavor )",
    "dependent mass with an at least approximately channel - independent momentum dependence .",
    "such a channel independence appears natural from the perspective of the naive quark model .",
    "indeed , the spectroscopic successes of the latter suggest that important bulk features of most hadrons can be understood on the basis of universal constituent - quark properties , and especially without assuming their internal structure , as revealed by their momentum dependence , to depend on the hadron state considered .",
    "our strategy for exploring the virtues and limitations of the rdqm method beyond the vector channel will rely mainly on a comparison of the resulting meson correlators with those obtained from other , as far as possible model - independent sources .",
    "as such input sources we employ experimental data , phenomenological estimates , and lattice results on point - to - point correlators . the latter constitute our main input in the spin-0 channels , which are not directly accessible to experimental probes . after outlining our calculational setup ,",
    "we discuss generic properties of the resulting rdqms and then proceed to their quantitative analysis . finally , we present our conclusions and offer a few speculations about improved implementations of resolution - dependent masses .",
    "qcd correlation functions of interpolating currents with hadronic quantum numbers link hadron properties rather directly to quark properties .",
    "hence they provide a suitable framework for phenomenological studies of resolution - dependent quark masses . the first such investigation @xcite dealt with the correlator of two vector currents at spacelike momentum transfer and modeled several diffractive high - energy processes on its basis . despite some motivation for this approach by an harmonic oscillator quark - model analogy for the photon wave function @xcite ,",
    "however , the physical foundations and the implementation of the method deserve further study .    as a step in this direction",
    ", we will generalize the rdqm approach below to the light meson correlators @xmath1 in those lorentz channels for which phenomenological and lattice data exist .",

    ", it might be useful to emphasize a crucial difference between the resolution - dependent quark masses @xmath29 defined above and the more conventional momentum - dependent self - energies which are encountered , e.g. , in quark or instanton - vacuum models . in contrast to the latter , the rdqm does _ not _ depend on the loop momentum @xmath30 flowing through the quark propagators , but rather on the overall momentum transfer @xmath16 which is assumed to set the resolution scale @xmath15 of the constituent quarks .",
    "this is analogous to the usual renormalization - group improvement of perturbation theory , where the running rg scale of coupling and mass parameters is similarly identified with the external momentum scale .",
    "the identification of the scale @xmath15 with the overall momentum @xmath16 , i.e. with a variable not associated with the individual quarks but rather with the ( channel - dependent ) correlator as a whole , raises the crucial issue of channel dependence for the resolution - dependent quark mass .",
    "information from several independent sources , including dispersive fits to experimental data in the spin-1 channels , qcd sum rules and lattice simulations of point - to - point correlators , indicate that the detailed structure of the spectral functions @xmath31 is strongly channel - dependent @xcite . nevertheless , most channels have two qualitative features in common : ( i ) only the lowest resonance in a given channel is clearly separated and fully resolved whereas the higher - lying ones increasingly merge with the multi - particle continuum , and ( ii ) local duality @xcite implies that the hadronic continuum , when averaged over suitable invariant - mass intervals , can be approximated by the free - quark continuum in the same channel .",
    "hence the available experimental and lattice data on the considered meson correlators are ( within their partially substantial errors , see below ) well described by a parametrization of the spectral functions in terms of a zero - width ground state pole and an effective continuum : @xmath32 this efficient and transparent parametrization , originally designed for qcd  sum rules @xcite , has by now become fairly standard in hadron correlator phenomenology @xcite .",

    "we have thus found first evidence for  a strong channel dependence of our rdqm procedure . it does not really come as a surprise , though , because the ( quasi- ) goldstone pion can not be consistently described in the constituent quark model , from which the rdqm approach draws part of its motivation .",
    "an artificially small constituent mass is also obtained from the longitudinal part of the axial - vector correlator since partial conservation of the axial - vector current ( pcac ) @xcite relates it to the pseudoscalar correlator as @xmath66 we have therefore not given the corresponding mass formula separately .      a characteristic property of resolution - dependent effective quark masses , expected on physical grounds and confirmed in ref .",

    "the vanishing of @xmath69 has been interpreted as a signature of chiral restoration since constituent quarks owe their mass to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and since the `` critical momentum '' @xmath68 gev is compatible with the scale @xmath70 gev around which one expects chiral symmetry to be restored . in the spin-1 channels chiral",
    "symmetry even becomes manifest since the noninteracting spin-1 correlators are chirally invariant in the zero - quark - mass limit .",
    "since chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking are determining features of hadron physics one would expect the restoration transition towards @xmath71 to be a generic and robust property of resolution - dependent constituent masses .",

    "this entails another channel - dependence of the rdqm procedure ( if it is not simply a shortcoming of our input data in the scalar channel ) .",
    "2 .   in the spin-1 channels ,",
    "we have again to distinguish between two domains of @xmath79-values : for @xmath93 , which is satisfied by part of our input data in the vector channel and all of them in the axial - vector channel , we find a finite solution for @xmath94 and none otherwise .",
    "for @xmath95 , which is satisfied by the remaining part of our input data in the vector channel , eq .",
    "( [ chires - va ] ) can again have either one or no physical solution , depending on which parameter set in table i is considered . for @xmath96 there is an upper bound on @xmath44 , given by @xmath97   , \\label{vaxbound}%\\ ] ] which can be somewhat sharpened in case of a unique solution ( see appendix ) .",
    "given an input data set for a correlator with the corresponding values for @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath79 , the above results instantly reveal whether the extracted @xmath69 will vanish at some finite @xmath76 . with the data in table",
    "i we predict a vanishing effective quark mass in the pseudoscalar channel as well as in the vector channel for the phenomenological , lattice i and ii , but not for the ilm  data , and no `` chiral restoration '' in the axial - vector channel ( the ilm data in this channel are excluded from this consideration since they do not satisfy @xmath100 ) .",
    "these predictions hold for the central values of the input parameter sets and are confirmed by our numerical analysis below . inside the rather large error range of the input parameter space in the vector channel there are also regions , however , in which no solution for @xmath44 exists .    moreover , our above findings show that  both the existence and the scale of the `` critical momentum '' @xmath76 are rather sensitive to the values of the hadronic input parameters . for @xmath101 gev , this dependence becomes so strong that details of the input data inside their systematic and statistical error range would contaminate the results .",
    "however , critical momenta of such a magnitude well beyond typical hadronic and restoration scales would have to be excluded anyhow on physical grounds , and their occurrence is strongly restricted ( for reasonable values of the hadronic parameters ) by the bounds ( [ psbound ] ) and ( [ vaxbound ] ) .",
    "finally , the above analysis shows that the rdqm procedure yields a well - defined and , in conjunction with the monotonicity of the @xmath102 , a unique @xmath12-dependence of the resolution - dependent quark masses once the input parameters are fixed",
    ".      a few additional limitations of the rdqm approach can be understood without numerical analysis .",
    "first and probably foremost , one should not expect this method to reproduce the exceptional properties of the pseudoscalar correlator , despite our observation that spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and restoration are to some extent incorporated .",
    "we have found above , for example , that the pion pole contribution can only be matched with almost vanishing , i.e. unacceptably small constituent quark masses ( cf .",
    "table [ tab : data ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the rdqm  approach derives its main motivation @xcite from an analogy with the nonrelativistic quark model .",
    "indeed , the latter also fails to describe the pion because it can not provide the strong binding required by goldstone s theorem .",
    "more generally , one might expect the rdqm approach to be overburdened in channels which contain exceptionally strongly bound states and to be more useful in channels where the lowest - lying resonances are quark - model states ( including , e.g. , the heavy - quark sector ) .    another qualitative limitation of the rdqm approach is related to the channel - dependence of broken internal symmetries . within the set of channels which we consider in this paper , this is most explicitly demonstrated for isospin symmetry .",
    "the underlying assumption of an isospin - symmetric effective mass , together with the isospin invariance of the free correlators , implies that the rdqm approach yields the same correlators in the scalar - isoscalar and scalar - isovector channels .",
    "the physical correlators in those two channels , however , differ rather strongly .",
    "in fact , lattice and instanton - liquid simulations as well as phenomenological estimates even find them to have opposite signs , indicating a rather strong attraction in the isoscalar and a similarly strong repulsion in the isovector channel @xcite .",
    "this and other substantial differences can not be captured by resolution - dependent quark masses _",
    "alone_. even the introduction of an unrealistically large up / down constituent mass difference , at the price of a strong departure from universality and good isospin , would not be able to reproduce , e.g. , the sign difference .",
    "in the following section , we discuss the results of determining the resolution - dependent quark masses according to the procedure described in section [ input ] , i.e. by solving eq .",

    "similarly large constituent masses together with the absence of a chiral restoration transition are also found in the axial - vector channel ( see below ) . ]  at the `` critical '' scale @xmath76 .",
    "this general behavior is in accord with the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite which were obtained in the same channel .",
    "the resulting @xmath16-dependence of @xmath0 is closest to the scale dependence of constituent masses which one would expect on the basis of the qualitative arguments given above .",
    "it is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : vector ] . as a consequence of  our different input data sets and their rather large errors , however , we find a similarly large range of values for @xmath76 .",
    "this is a further indication for the mostly qualitative character of the estimates for @xmath69 which can be obtained from the rdqm approach .",
    "the transverse axial - vector channel shares several common features with the vector channel .",
    "in particular , both noninteracting amplitudes become equal for zero quark mass .",
    "the main difference , at least in the duality - based continuum parametrization of the input data , is the about 60% larger resonance mass .",
    "it results in a much smaller ( negative ) slope of the @xmath120 , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : axialvector ] .",
    "this is the smallest slope found in all considered channels : @xmath0 drops from its `` constituent '' value of about @xmath121 mev to about @xmath122 mev at @xmath123 gev@xmath51 and saturates there . in particular",
    ", @xmath69 does not vanish at any finite @xmath12 , i.e. there is no indication for chiral restoration in this channel .",
    "( in order to obtain a restoration transition , the coupling @xmath124 would have to be about 3 times larger than the phenomenological estimate , i.e. @xmath125 . ) in view of the similarities and the chiral relation with the vector channel , this result might seem surprising . perhaps it is an indication for the constituent - quark picture to fail at the rather large scales set by the mass of the @xmath126 . in any case , the qualitative difference between the behavior of @xmath69 in the vector and axial - vector channels supplies our probably least expected case of channel - dependence in the rdqm  approach since , in contrast to the pseudoscalar correlator , both vector and axial - vector resonances are well described by the nrqm .",
    "the scalar - isovector channel is singled out by the fact that neither in the lattice nor in the instanton - liquid and phenomenological resonance is commonly interpreted as a 4-quark state and therefore not included in the phenomenological analysis of ref . @xcite . ]",
    "data the pole of the lowest - lying resonance could be resolved . our qualitative analysis in section [ chires ]",
    "established that in this case the effective quark mass can not vanish , so that their exists no finite @xmath44 in this channel .",
    "this is confirmed by the numerical analysis , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scalar ] .",
    "( unfortunately , lattice data for the scalar - isoscalar point - to - point correlator do not yet exist .",
    "this prevents us from studying the isospin - dependence in the scalar channel and in the delineated effective quark masses ( cf .",
    "section [ lims ] ) quantitatively . )    @xmath127 $ ]    @xmath127 $ ]    @xmath127 $ ]",
    "in our above analysis we have investigated several aspects of resolution - dependent quark masses in hadronic current - current correlation functions . to this end , we have generalized the recently proposed rdqm description @xcite , based on noninteracting mesonic correlators with a resolution - dependent constituent quark mass @xmath128 , beyond the vector channel .",
    "we have then determined the resolution - dependent masses by matching the rdqm correlators to the available experimental and lattice data in the light meson channels .",
    "this enables us to clarify several virtues and limitations of the rdqm approach by comparison with a larger body of physical information .",
    "while the stringency of such comparative tests is limited by the rather large errors of our input data , it is on the other hand enhanced by the rich variety of physics in the different spin-0 and spin-1 meson channels .    despite this diversity , we find the small-@xmath12 behavior of the effective masses to be relatively channel - independent : in all but the pseudoscalar channel we obtain values in the expected range of about 250 - 350 mev for @xmath129 . the overall description of mesonic correlators in terms of noninteracting correlators with a unique @xmath0 and a restoration scale @xmath130 , however",
    ", does not generalize beyond the vector - meson channel .",
    "in fact , we do not find an even approximately universal effective mass : first of all , and as expected , the rdqm method can not reproduce the pseudoscalar correlator with a physically reasonable constituent mass . secondly , it also fails to generalize to channels like the axial - vector one whose ground - state resonances are quark - model states .",
    "this is more surprising since the approach was conceived in a nonrelativistic quark model setting .",
    "furthermore , nonperturbative enhancements of flavor - symmetry breaking , as they manifest themselves e.g. in the substantial differences between the isoscalar and isovector @xmath131 correlators , are not captured .",
    "even the vanishing of @xmath69 at a finite @xmath44 , related to chiral symmetry restoration and thus expected to be a rather robust feature , is realized only in the vector correlator .",
    "the above shortcomings can be traced to essentially one common root : the various correlator channels differ only in the dirac and flavor structure of their interpolating fields , and consequently all channel dependence of the rdqm  correlators is contained exclusively in the weights of chirally even and odd combinations of the _ free _ dirac propagators in the spin and flavor traces .",
    "the differences between those weights are of order unity and hence can not generate the pronounced channel patterns found in the input data for the interacting correlators . if one nevertheless insists on matching free correlators with @xmath12-dependent quark masses to those input data , one is bound to obtain strongly channel - dependent effective masses . thus the rdqm parametrization is inconsistent with the assumption of the constituent - quark picture that the basic properties of constituent quarks do not depend on the hadron channel in which they are probed .",
    "this finding strongly suggests that the minimal rdqm approach , describing all correlators by just a free quark loop with resolution - dependent masses , overburdens those masses with the task of mocking up dynamics which should play itself out elsewhere .    from a microscopic point of view",
    "this is not surprising .",
    "a consistent rg - treatment of any quark dynamics would generate , besides the explicit interactions , a resolution dependence not only for the quark mass but also for the couplings and interpolating currents . as an illustrative example , consider the qualitative distinction between vector and axial - vector channels which comes about because only the non - conserved axial - vector interpolator gets renormalized .",
    "the lack of this effect in the rdqm approach might at least partially explain the absence of a restoration transition in the axial - vector channel .    since the free quark loop is the leading contribution to the correlators in relativistic chiral quark models , it is suggestive to consult such models in search for a systematic improvement of the minimal rdqm approach .",
    "additional incentive for the use of this framework derives from the fact that a resolution dependence of the quark mass emerges naturally as a cutoff - scale dependence in the rg flow of chiral quark models @xcite , and that chiral symmetry breaking and restoration arise dynamically .",
    "to low orders in the quark - meson interactions , typical corrections due to the exchange of @xmath132- and @xmath133-mesons in such models are shown diagrammatically in fig .",
    "[ fig : feynman ] .    [ ptb ]    feynmangraphs.ps    \\(a ) ( b )    it is tempting to speculate about their qualitative impact and about whether the absence of such contributions in the minimal rdqm  approach might explain some of its shortcomings .",
    "the pole diagram ( a ) contributes only in the pseudoscalar and longitudinal axial - vector channels where a pion is exchanged . since this contribution is very strongly attractive , it is likely that its neglect prevents a minimal rdqm  description of the corresponding correlators with a constituent mass of the typical size .",
    "diagram ( b ) contributes in the scalar , pseudoscalar , vector and axial - vector channels through vertices with the meson content@xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 , respectively .",
    "the contribution to the vector correlator is therefore mediated solely by goldstone bosons .",
    "hence the ensuing corrections set in at very low @xmath12 . in the minimal rdqm  correlator , on the other hand , the absence of the corresponding strength can only be compensated by a smaller constituent quark mass @xmath138 .",
    "this might explain why we indeed find @xmath119 to be somewhat lower than the typical constituent mass scale .",
    "the lighter constituent mass might also facilitate the restoration transition in the vector relative to the transverse axial - vector channel .",
    "in contrast , the corrections of type ( b ) to the axial - vector channel set in at higher @xmath12 since the more massive @xmath132-meson participates . these contributions should be negligible at small @xmath12 , rendering @xmath139 our perhaps most reliable estimate for the constituent mass .",
    "moreover , since corrections of type ( b ) with a @xmath132-@xmath133 pair exchanged can contribute strongly at momenta @xmath140 close to the typical restoration scale , their neglect may be partially responsible for the absence of a chiral - restoration transition in the transverse axial - vector rdqm correlator . in the scalar channel",
    "the situation is less conclusive . since",
    "a pion pair can be exchanged in this channel , too , it is not a priori clear why we obtain a reasonable constituent mass value for @xmath141 although this correction is neglected in the rdqm approach .    the above qualitative arguments , although tentative , give some hints as to why the minimal rdqm treatment does not generalize , with an approximately universal @xmath0 , beyond the vector channel .",
    "it remains an interesting and open question to which extent a more sophisticated dynamical treatment , e.g. in the context of chiral quark models , could achieve a unified description of the variety among hadron correlators on the basis of universal , resolution - dependent quark masses .",
    "in this appendix , we analyze the two equations ( [ chires - sp ] , [ chires - va ] ) in detail and derive conditions for the existence , general properties and channel dependence of the critical scale @xmath44 defined in section [ chires ] . since the involved hadronic scales are mutually too close to allow for useful approximations and since the exact solutions are less than transparent , we resort to an indirect approach .    for the spin-0 channels , we start by rearranging eq .",

    "( [ boundeq ] ) to be positive .",
    "this is easily seen to be impossible ( for @xmath169 it takes values in @xmath176   \\times m_{v / at}^{2}$ ] and for @xmath170 in @xmath177   \\times m_{v / at}^{2}$ ] ) .",
