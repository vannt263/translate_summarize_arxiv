    "electrical detection of the spin accumulation is one of the important technologies to achieve semiconductor - based spintronic applications.@xcite though excellent studies of these technologies were reported for gaas - based devices , almost all the spin - related phenomena were observed below room temperature.@xcite in general , it has been understood that the decay of the spin signals originates from the spin - flip scattering induced by the spin - orbit interaction , hyperfine interaction between electrons and nuclei , and so on.@xcite to minimize such intrinsic factors , silicon - based spintronic technologies have been proposed and developed,@xcite and room - temperature detections of the spin - dependent signals have been reported recently.@xcite    the temperature - dependent spin - related phenomena in si - based devices were explored experimentally.@xcite for nondoped si channels,@xcite the relaxation of the injected spins can be explained by yafet s @xmath0 power law , indicating that the decay of the spin signals is attributed to the spin - flip scattering in the channel . for heavily doped si ( degenerated si ) channels , on the other hand , the decrease in the spin polarization of the injected spins is one of the main factors for the decay of spin signals.@xcite however , there is no study of the temperature - dependent spin signals for nondegenerated si channels .    in this article",
    ", we report on temperature evolution of spin signals by measuring the three - terminal hanle effect in the lateral device with a nondegenerated silicon channel . in our device with a cofe / si schottky - tunnel - barrier contact , a clear difference in the temperature - dependent spin signals between spin - extraction and spin - injection conditions is observed . under a certain condition",
    ", the sensitivity of the spin detection can contribute dominantly to the magnitude of spin signals detected .",
    "the cofe epitaxial layer was grown on si(111 ) by low - temperature molecular beam epitaxy ( lt - mbe ) at 60 @xmath1c and the cofe / si interface was atomically flat.@xcite a three - terminal lateral device ( channel thickness @xmath2 100 nm , carrier density @xmath3 6.0 @xmath4 10@xmath5 @xmath6 ) with one single - crystalline co@xmath7fe@xmath8 contact and two ausb ohmic ones with lateral dimensions of 10 @xmath4 200 @xmath9m@xmath10 and 100 @xmath4 200 @xmath9m@xmath10 , respectively , was fabricated by using conventional processes with photolithography , ar@xmath11 ion milling , and reactive ion etching.@xcite the schematic diagram of the device structure is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "the distance between cofe and ausb is about @xmath2 50 @xmath9 m . to achieve tunneling conduction through the high - quality cofe / si interface",
    ", we inserted sb @xmath12-doped @xmath13-si layer ( sb @xmath2 5@xmath410@xmath14 @xmath6 ) with a thickness of 5 nm between the epitaxial cofe layer and @xmath15-si channel.@xcite as a result , we obtained tunneling conduction having nonlinear @xmath16 characteristics through the interface and the rectification is quite small , as shown in fig .",
    "therefore , we can regard the fabricated cofe/@xmath13-si/@xmath15-si contact for spin injection and extraction as a schottky - tunnel - barrier contact . hanle - effect measurements with a three - terminal geometry were performed by a dc method at 40 @xmath2 300 k. in the measurements , a small magnetic field perpendicular to the plane , @xmath17 , was applied after the magnetic moment of the cofe contact aligned parallel to the plane along the long axis of the contact .",
    "spin accumulation in semiconductor channels can be detected electrically by measuring three - terminal voltage changes ( @xmath18@xmath19 ) via hanle - type spin precessions.@xcite figures 1(c ) and 1(d ) show representative @xmath18@xmath19-@xmath17 curves for @xmath20 -1.0 and 1.0 @xmath9a at 40 k. the electrons are injected into and extracted from , respectively , the si conduction band for reverse ( @xmath21 0 ) and forward ( @xmath22 0 ) biases , where quadratic background voltages depending on @xmath17 are subtracted from the raw data .",
    "we note that clear hanle - effect signals were observed for both bias - current conditions but the sign of the voltage change is opposite .",
    "such sign reversal was seen only when the polarity of @xmath23 was switched .",
    "these curves were fitted with a simple lorentzian function,@xcite @xmath18@xmath19(@xmath17 ) @xmath24 @xmath18@xmath25/[1+(@xmath26@xmath27)@xmath10 ] , where @xmath29 @xmath30@xmath17/@xmath31 is the larmor frequency , @xmath32 is the electron @xmath32-factor ( @xmath33 2 ) , @xmath34 is the bohr magneton , @xmath27 is the lower limit of spin relaxation time . the fitting results are denoted by the red solid curves .",
    "the @xmath27 values for @xmath20 -1.0 and 1.0 @xmath9a are estimated to be @xmath2 4.37 and @xmath2 2.05 nsec , respectively .",
    "the precise origin of the difference in @xmath27 between @xmath20 -1.0 and 1.0 @xmath9a is unclear yet , but we can consider a possible difference in the relative position of the spin accumulation in @xmath15-si to the @xmath13-si layer , as illustrated in fig .",
    "there may be some differences in the influence of the @xmath13-si layer on spin relaxation between spin injection ( @xmath21 0 ) and extraction ( @xmath22 0 ) conditions .",

    "we can see that @xmath38@xmath39 at 100 k is larger than that at 50 k. concentrating on this interesting phenomenon , we further explored temperature - dependent @xmath38@xmath39 for various @xmath23 in detail . figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) show @xmath38@xmath39 as a function of temperature for spin - extraction ( @xmath22 0 ) and spin - injection ( @xmath21 0 ) conditions , respectively .",
    "the features observed are summarized as follows : ( i ) temperature evolution of @xmath38@xmath39 shows a clear difference between spin - extraction ( @xmath22 0 ) and spin - injection ( @xmath21 0 ) conditions .",
    "( ii ) @xmath38@xmath39 can be detected even at room - temperature with a large injection current of - 20 @xmath9a in @xmath21 0 [ see the inset of fig .",

    "@xmath27 for @xmath43 -20 @xmath9a at room temperature can be estimated to be 1.36 nsec . the @xmath27 value decreases with increasing temperature from 3.02 to 1.36 nsec , consistent with the feature observed in the heavily doped si.@xcite ( iii ) in @xmath43 -0.1 and -1.0 @xmath9a we can see the partial increases in @xmath38@xmath39 despite the rise of temperature [ see arrows in fig .",

    "the inset of ( a ) shows carrier density and resistivity as a function of temperature for the si channel used in this study .",
    "the inset of ( b ) displays room - temperature hanle - effect signal at @xmath43 -20 @xmath9a and the fitting curve with lorentzian function.,width=321 ]    to examine these phenomena , first of all , temperature dependences of resistivity ( @xmath44 ) and carrier density ( @xmath15 ) were shown in the inset of fig .",
    "2(a ) , where @xmath44 and @xmath15 were measured directly by four - terminal transport and hall effect measurements . both @xmath44 and @xmath15 have strong temperature dependence in @xmath45 100 k , nearly consistent with the feature of a general nondegenerated si.@xcite in this context , we should consider the component of @xmath38@xmath39 associated with changing @xmath44 on the basis of the spin diffusion model.@xcite since the spin - related voltage changes in si are proportional to @xmath44@xmath4@xmath46,@xcite the variation in @xmath44 with changing temperature can affect @xmath38@xmath39 in our measurements .",
    "the detail is discussed later .    next , in fig .",
    "3 we examined @xmath38@xmath39 versus @xmath47 , i.e. , the bias voltage at the cofe / si interface for various temperatures .",
    "the @xmath38@xmath39 in @xmath48 0 has an evident maximum value at a certain @xmath47 , where @xmath48 0 indicates spin - extraction conditions ( @xmath22 0 ) .",
    "this means that there is the most sensitive @xmath47 value for detecting spin - accumulation signals in @xmath22 0 .",
    "we would like to define the detectability for the spin accumulation signals as the sensitivity of the spin detection at the biased contact .",
    "in general , the sensitivity of the spin detection at the schottky - tunnel - barrier contacts has already been discussed for ferromagnet / semiconductor lateral devices.@xcite the observed feature also implies that we should consider the sensitivity of the spin detection for our cofe / si schottky - tunnel - barrier contacts .",
    "however , when we focus on the temperature evolution of @xmath38@xmath39 at a certain @xmath47 , the feature of the reduction in @xmath38@xmath39 with increasing temperature is relatively simple in @xmath48 0 .",
    "namely , we do not need to consider the change in the spin - detection sensitivity with temperature evolution in @xmath22 0 .",
    "on the other hand , there is almost no clear correlation between @xmath38@xmath39 and @xmath47 in @xmath49 0 , where @xmath49 0 indicates spin - injection conditions ( @xmath21 0 ) .",
    "we find that in -0.1 v @xmath41 @xmath47 @xmath41 0 v @xmath38@xmath39 at 75 and 100 k is higher than that at 40 and 50 k. namely , for @xmath21 0 , we should also consider the sensitivity of the spin detection with temperature evolution .",
    "@xmath18@xmath37@xmath36 as a function of @xmath47 for various temperatures .",
    "the insets show temperature - dependent @xmath50 for various @xmath23 conditions.,width=283 ]    here we also concentrate on the variation in the interface resistance ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "3 shows @xmath50 as a function of temperature for various @xmath23 conditions .",
    "since the @xmath16 characteristics of our device are nonlinear features , the @xmath50 values can be varied with changing @xmath23 .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath50 slightly decreases with increasing temperature for all @xmath23 conditions .",
    "hence @xmath47 can also slightly be changed by the variation in temperature even if we use the same @xmath23 condition for the spin injection or extraction .",
    "considering these features described so far , we discuss the temperature evolution of @xmath38@xmath39 . under spin - extraction conditions",
    "( @xmath22 0 ) [ see fig .",
    "4(a ) ] , we do not have to consider the temperature - dependent sensitivity of the spin detection at a certain @xmath47 , as described in previous paragraph .",
    "we explain the detailed picture as follows . when the electrons tunnel from the si conduction band into the spin - polarized empty states in cofe at low temperature ( e.g. 40 k ) under @xmath47 ( @xmath51 ) , the spin accumulation ( @xmath18@xmath9 ) can be formed in the si conduction band , as shown in the left figure of fig .",
    "in this situation , the spin - dependent tunneling of electrons is dominant at the fermi level ( see - dashed pink line ) , leading to the detection of @xmath18@xmath9 .",
    "as the temperature rises [ e.g. 100 k , see right figure of fig .",
    "4(a ) ] , @xmath47 is reduced , resulting in a small decrease in @xmath51 .",
    "simultaneously , @xmath15 is steeply enhanced from @xmath5210@xmath53 to @xmath210@xmath5 @xmath6 , causing the rapid decrease in @xmath44 . as a result , though the @xmath18@xmath9 value decreases markedly based on the spin diffusion model,@xcite there is almost no difference in the basic situation for the detection of @xmath18@xmath9 after the rise of temperature . in other words , we can detect @xmath18@xmath9 induced by the spin extraction irrespective of temperature because the spin - dependent tunneling of electrons is maintained .",
    "therefore , there is the sensitivity of the spin detection . in this case , since @xmath18@xmath9 in the si conduction band is related directly to the observed @xmath38@xmath39 values , the change in @xmath44 can dominantly affect the @xmath38@xmath39 values on the basis of the spin diffusion model . in fig .",
    "2(a ) we can find the steep and gradual decreases in @xmath38@xmath39 in @xmath45 100 k and @xmath54 100 k , respectively .",
    "since @xmath44 in @xmath54 100 k is almost constant , the contribution of @xmath44 to the decrease in @xmath38@xmath39 can be ignored in @xmath54 100 k. we infer that , for spin - extraction conditions , the features in @xmath45 100 k and @xmath54 100 k are dominated by the reduction in @xmath44 and @xmath55 ( increase in the spin - flip scattering in si ) , respectively .",
    "it seems that the change in @xmath38@xmath39 influenced by the spin - flip scattering is relatively small in the device with a nondegenerated si channel .        under spin - injection conditions ( @xmath21 0 ) , by contrast",
    ", we have to consider two different cases whether the injection current is relatively large or not , as shown in fig .",
    "when the large injection current ( e.g. @xmath43 -20 @xmath9a ) is used , the relatively large @xmath18@xmath9 can be demonstrated.@xcite thus @xmath18@xmath9 induced in the si conduction band can reach the fermi level of the spin - polarized tunneling electrons at any temperatures .",
    "when the temperature rises , @xmath18@xmath9 is merely reduced ( middle figures ) by the same mechanism of fig .",
    "namely , we can still obtain the sensitivity of the spin detection . on the other hand ,",
    "if the injection current is relatively low ( e.g. @xmath43 -0.1 @xmath9a ) at 40 k , @xmath18@xmath9 induced in the si conduction band is quite small .",
    "since the relatively large @xmath51 is applied in the low bias current regime at 40 k , we can understand that the position of the quasi fermi level of the spin - polarized electrons in the si conduction band is quite lower than the fermi level ( dashed pink line ) of the spin - polarized tunneling electrons from cofe .",
    "in this situation , the spin - polarized electrons can tunnel into the unpolarized states ( unoccupied states ) in the si conduction band .",
    "thus we could not obtain @xmath18@xmath9 as a consequence of the @xmath38@xmath39 measurement at @xmath43 -0.1 @xmath9a and 40 k. this means that there is no sensitivity of the spin detection .",
    "the similar situations have already been reported for fe / gaas devices previously,@xcite and we have also reported the above features in detail for the cofe / si devices.@xcite    why we can see that @xmath38@xmath39 appears at 100 k for @xmath43 -0.1 @xmath9a despite the rise of temperature ? shown in the right figure of the bottom in fig .",
    "4(b ) is a possible schematic illustration of the interpretation of the spin detection .",
    "as previously described , when the temperature rises up to 100 k , @xmath15 is enhanced from @xmath52 10@xmath53 to 10@xmath5 @xmath6 , causing the rapid decrease in @xmath44 . as a result",
    ", @xmath18@xmath9 is also reduced on the basis of the spin diffusion model.@xcite simultaneously , since @xmath47 also decreases with decreasing @xmath50 , the reduction in @xmath51 also occurs .",
    "accordingly , the fermi level of the spin - polarized tunneling electrons is located on @xmath18@xmath9 induced in the si conduction band , leading to the appearance of the sensitivity of the spin detection .",
    "this can be considered to be the same situation for @xmath43 -20 @xmath9a at 40 k shown in the left figure of fig .",
    "this is a possible mechanism of the appearance of the spin accumulation signals ( @xmath38@xmath39 ) with increasing temperature , observed in fig .",
    "such qualitative consideration has already been explained in terms of the change in the spin - detection sensitivity at the tunnel contact.@xcite we emphasize that the tuning of @xmath47 ( @xmath51 ) is a key to detect @xmath18@xmath9 induced by the spin injection .",
    "we finally comment on the difference in the actual temperature evolution of the decrease in @xmath38@xmath39 between spin - extraction ( @xmath22 0 ) and spin - injection ( @xmath21 0 ) conditions for the large currents of @xmath43 @xmath5620 @xmath9a [ see figs .",
    "2(a ) and ( b ) ] .",
    "as mentioned above , the temperature dependent @xmath38@xmath39 for @xmath22 0 can be explained mainly by the change in @xmath44 .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath21 0 , we should consider not only the contribution of @xmath44 and @xmath55 to @xmath38@xmath39 but also that of the spin - detection sensitivity to @xmath38@xmath39 .",
    "though @xmath38@xmath39 is reduced with decrease in @xmath44 and @xmath55 , the sensitivity of the spin detection is enhanced in a low current bias regime at the same time .",
    "this opposite feature causes the relatively gradual decrease in @xmath38@xmath39 at @xmath43 -20 @xmath9a compared with that at @xmath43 + 20 @xmath9a , as shown in fig .",
    "2 . in our opinion",
    ", it is very important for room - temperature device operation@xcite to understand the temperature - dependent sensitivity of the spin detection at the schottky - tunnel - barrier contact in devices with a nondegenerated si channel .",
    "we have studied temperature evolution of spin accumulation signals obtained by the three - terminal hanle effect measurements for the device with a nondegenerated si channel . the clear difference in the temperature - dependent spin signals between spin - extraction and",
    "spin - injection conditions was seen .",
    "we found that it is important for the consideration of the temperature evolution to understand not only the mechanism based on the spin diffusion model but also the sensitivity of the spin detection at the schottky - tunnel - barrier contact .",
    "these results are also important to enhance the spin signals in the device applications at room temperature .      11 s. a. wolf , d. d. awschalom , r. a. buhrman , j. m. daughton , s. v. molnr , m. l. roukes , a. y. chtchelkanova , and d. m. treger , science * 294 * , 1488 ( 2001 ) ; h. dery , p. dalal ,  .",
