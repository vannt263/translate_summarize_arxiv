    "electronic nematic phases have been a focus of attention during the past few years in several areas of quantum condensed matter physics.@xcite an electronic nematic is a state of a strongly correlated electronic system in which rotational invariance is broken spontaneously without breaking translation symmetry . unlike their classical liquid crystal cousins,@xcite",
    "whose tendency to exhibit orientational order can be traced back to the microscopic cigar - shaped nature of the constituent nematogen molecules , an electronic nematic phase arises from the self - organization of electrons in a strongly correlated material .",
    "the electronic nematic state belongs to a class of phases of strongly - interacting quantum - mechanical electronic matter , known as electronic liquid crystal states,@xcite which are characterized by the spontaneous breaking of the spatial symmetries of a physical system .",
    "electronic nematic phases have by now been discovered experimentally in many different systems ranging , among others , from high temperature cuprate superconductors , such as in @xcite for a broad range of doping levels , and in underdoped , @xcite to iron - based superconductors such as 122,@xcite and also to the bilayer ruthenate .@xcite    however , the first and to this date the most spectacular experimental evidence for an electronic nematic state was discovered in two - dimensional electron gases ( 2deg ) in high magnetic fields in the middle of the second , @xmath1 , landau level ( and higher ) , in regimes in which the 2deg is compressible and the fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) effect is not observed.@xcite in these experiments , longitudinal and hall transport measurements were made in the center of the landau level for landau levels @xmath2 .",
    "it was found that the longitudinal transport properties exhibit a strong spatial anisotropy ( with a ratio of resistances as large as 3,500 in the cleanest samples at the lowest temperatures , originally down to @xmath3 mk ) .",
    "this anisotropy has a fairly rapid increase at a temperature @xmath4 mk from a nominal anisotropy of a fraction of a percent at @xmath5 k. importantly , in this regime the i - v curves are linear at low bias and , hence , do not show any signs of translation symmetry breaking , e.g. no threshold electric fields , characteristic for a charge - density - wave ground state , were ever detected in this regime .",
    "in contrast , in the same samples and at the same temperatures , a reentrant integer quantum hall plateau is observed away from the center of the landau level , and , in this regime , an extremely sharp threshold electric field is seen , with a sharp onset of narrow - band noise for larger electric fields.@xcite nevertheless , these experiments were originally interpreted as evidence of a striped ground state , an interpretation still used in the literature .    hence , in the compressible anisotropic regime , down to the lowest temperature accessible in the experiments ( which currently go down to about @xmath6 mk ) , the 2deg behaves as a compressible charged fluid with a large anisotropy which onsets below a well defined temperature .",
    "this behavior strongly suggested that there is a ( thermal ) phase transition of the 2deg , rounded by a very weak native anisotropy ( with a characteristic energy scale estimated to be @xmath7 mk , whose microscopic origin has remained unclear@xcite ) to a low - temperature electronic nematic state.@xcite the nematic nature of the state was verified by detailed fits of the transport anisotropy data to classical monte carlo simulations of the thermal fluctuations of nematic order.@xcite    subsequent experiments in 2degs in quantum wells , earlier by tilting the magnetic field,@xcite and , more recently , by the application of hydrostatic pressure in the absence of an in - plane magnetic field,@xcite have revealed the existence of a complex phase diagram in which compressible nematic phases were found even in the first landau level , @xmath8 , competing with the famous , presumably non - abelian , paired , fqh state at filling fraction @xmath9 .",
    "more recent tilted field experiments have also revealed the existence of an incompressible nematic fqh state in the @xmath8 landau level at filling fraction @xmath10 , competing with the isotropic laughlin - like fqh state at that filling fraction.@xcite no nematic state has ever been reported in the lowest , @xmath11 , landau level .",
    "early hartree - fock theories of the 2degs near the center of the landau level , for landau level index @xmath12 large enough , have predicted a stripe - like ground state , i.e. a compressible state in which the electron density is spontaneously modulated along one direction.@xcite for this reason , the anisotropic states in the compressible regimes in landau levels @xmath13 were originally referred to as striped states .",
    "most microscopic theories for the anisotropic state at @xmath14 ( and in higher landau levels ) were built on this proposal.@xcite the resulting picture of the stripe state is an array of `` sliding '' luttinger liquids.@xcite    on the other hand , an exact diagonalization study by rezayi and haldane@xcite for a system of up to 16 electrons for half - filled landau levels in a toroidal geometry gave strong evidence for both a paired fqh state and a stripe - like state as a function of the effective interactions in the landau level .",
    "we should note that in such small system ( and in a toroidal geometry ) finite - size effects can blur the distinction between a stripe state and a nematic state , but it is an evidence for at least short - range stripe order .",
    "interest in nematic quantum hall states attracted renewed attention after the experimental discovery of an incompressible nematic phase inside the fractional quantum hall state in the @xmath8 landau level at filling fraction @xmath10 by xia and coworkers.@xcite this state has been studied theoretically by several groups.@xcite these studies have revealed that nematic fluctuations are intimately related to the geometric response of the quantum hall fluid and , in particular , to the hall viscosity .",
    "the incompressible nature of nematic fractional quantum hall states strongly constrains the behavior of the nematic fluctuations and largely determines the structure of the effective behavior at low energies .",
    "these studies have also shown that the nematic transition inside the fqh state is triggered by a softening and condensation of the stable collective mode of the fqh fluid , the girvin - macdonald - platzman ( gmp ) mode , at zero momentum .",
    "the close vicinity of nematic order of a compressible state or a fqh state ( which is hence incompressible ) strongly suggests that the nature of the effective interactions in the 2deg in landau levels @xmath15 favor both paired and nematic ordered states . in this context",
    ", it is surprising that , in spite of all the work on nematicity in the incompressible state , there has been almost no work on the compressible nematic state for more than a decade . aside from the notable semi - phenomenological theory of the quantum hall nematic of radzihovsky and dorsey,@xcite based both on a microscopic theory and on quantum hydrodynamics , and of the work of wexler and",
    "dorsey,@xcite who made estimates of the dislocation - unbinding transition of a quantum hall stripe state to a quantum hall nematic based on the hartree - fock theory of the stripe state , except for a variational monte carlo wave function study by doan and manousakis,@xcite the compressible nematic state has not been studied .    in principle",
    "there are two logical pathways to reach a nematic phase by a quantum phase transition : a ) by quantum melting of a stripe phase , or b ) by a ( pomeranchuk ) instability of an isotropic fermi liquid type state .",
    "although the close vicinity of the isotropic compressible fermi liquid state to the observed nematic state in landau levels @xmath16 suggests that the latter may be a suitable starting point , the fact that exact diagonalization studies find local stripe order@xcite suggests that the actual physics is likely to lie somewhere in between these two regimes . also , it is possible that the state is nematic above some critical temperature while the ground state may be a stripe phase .",
    "however , the fact that there is strong evidence for rotation symmetry breaking but not of translation symmetry breaking , down to the lowest experimentally accessible temperatures , suggests that the ground state may be a nematic state ( perhaps close to a quantum phase transition to a stripe phase . )",
    "the purpose of this paper is to develop a theory of the compressible nematic state of the 2deg in large magnetic fields . throughout this work",
    "we will use the mapping of electrons in landau levels to composite fermions in the same landau levels but now coupled to a chern - simons gauge field,@xcite i.e. a flux attachment transformation . at a formal first - quantized level this mapping is an exact identity .",
    "however the resulting theory has no small parameter and in practice a mean field theory , the average field approximation , must be used . for fqh states , which have a finite energy gap already at the level of the mean field theory , this approach has been shown to yield exact predictions of the universal properties of the fractional quantum hall fluid , including the hall conductance , the charge and statistics of the excitations , degeneracy on a torus , and the hall viscosity and related geometric responses.@xcite on the other hand , here we will be interested in compressible phases which do not have a gap ( by definition ) and hence the theory is not as well controlled as in the fqh regime . as our starting point we will consider the isotropic fermi liquid state of halperin , lee and read@xcite ( hlr ) of composite fermions,@xcite which is based on the same mapping , and look for a pomeranchuk quantum phase transition to a nematic state .",
    "this is a natural point of view which has been used extensively as a description of nematic fermi fluids.@xcite however , the hlr fermi liquid is a non - fermi liquid to begin with which makes the application of these ideas not straightforward .    at the level of mean field theory , the hlr ( or jain ) fermi liquid states are the limiting state of the fqh states in the jain sequences@xcite with filling fraction @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are two non - negative integers . in jain s picture ,",
    "a fqh state of electrons can be viewed ( in mean field theory ) as an integer quantum hall state with filling fraction @xmath20 of composite fermions , which is made of gluing @xmath21 fluxes to every electron , in a partially screened magnetic field @xmath22 . in the compressible limit",
    ", @xmath23 , the effective magnetic field felt by the composite fermions vanishes ( on average ) or , equivalently , the effective charge of the fermions vanishes in the same limit . in this regime , the charge - neutral composite fermions fill a fermi sea and form a ( composite ) fermi liquid.@xcite this simple picture , and its subsequent extensions , has given a successful description of numerous experiments in the compressible regime.@xcite also , a current picture of the microscopic origin of the non - abelian paired state in the first , @xmath8 , landau level , at filling fraction @xmath9 , is a paired state in the @xmath24 channel of composite fermions.@xcite it is then natural to look for a similar quantum transition to a compressible nematic state from the hlr state .    in ref .",
    "[ ] we worked out a theory of the incompressible nematic state in a fractional quantum hall state using the flux attachment via fermion chern - simons gauge theory@xcite as a quantum phase transition in a laughlin fqh state .",
    "much as in the case of the nematic transition in a conventional fermi liquid,@xcite we showed that the quantum phase transition ( the pomeranchuk instability ) can be caused by an effective quadrupolar interaction of among the electrons if it becomes sufficiently attractive .",
    "furthermore , we showed that the electrons feel fluctuations of the nematic order parameter as an effective dynamical metric field .",
    "a direct consequence of this coupling is that the effective lagrangian of the nematic fluctuations has a time - reversal breaking parity - odd berry phase term , which is closely related to ( but not equal to ) the hall viscosity . due to this parity odd term",
    ", the quantum critical theory has dynamical exponent @xmath25 .",
    "there are also wen - zee - like term in terms of the  effective \" dynamical metric , i.e. , nematic order parameters . in the nematic phase",
    ", there is a topological soliton , the nematic disclination , which in this fluid carries an ( unquantized ) electrical charge .",
    "the resulting effective field theory of the nematic fractional quantum hall state obtained by this approach has the same structure and properties as the one proposed on symmetry grounds by maciejko and coworkers.@xcite    the theory of the compressible nematic state that we will present here is naturally connected to our earlier work on the incompressible nematic fqh state .",
    "thus , we will represent the problem of the half - filled landau level and , in fact , for all the compressible limiting states of the jain sequences , at filling fraction @xmath26 , as a system of composite fermions minimally coupled ( i.e. in gauge - invariant way ) to both the external electromagnetic field @xmath27 and to the statistical gauge field @xmath28 which implements the flux attachment .",
    "hence , here too , the action also includes a chern - simons term ( with a suitable coefficient ) .    also , in addition to the coulomb interaction , which only involves a coupling of the local densities , as in the case of a fermi liquid,@xcite we will also include an attractive interaction in the quadrupolar channel , i.e. an attractive interaction between the nematic densities .",
    "the coupling constant of this quadrupolar interaction is nothing but the @xmath29 landau parameter of a fermi liquid . by gauge invariance ,",
    "the quadrupolar coupling of the fermions also involves both the gauge fields , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , since the nematic densities are bilinear of the fermi fields which necessarily involve spatial derivatives .",
    "we will not attempt here to provide a microscopic derivation of the value ( and sign ) of the effective quadrupolar interaction .",
    "nevertheless , it is well known that the effective interactions of composite fermions are quite different than those of electrons,@xcite and depend on the landau level index , as well as on properties of the heterostructure ( or quantum well ) which define the 2deg .",
    "in addition , the estimate of values of landau parameters , which is notoriously difficult even for conventional fermi liquids , is much harder in the case of composite fermions .",
    "the currently available numerical estimates@xcite for @xmath29 obtain values that for @xmath16 are very close to @xmath30 .    however , the physics of the compressible state is actually quite different from the fqh states , and the extension of this theory to the compressible state involves several problems .",
    "one is the lack of a small expansion parameter to control the theory . in the incompressible fqh states this is not a serious problem",
    "provided that one focused only on the long distance and low energy regime where it behaves as a topological fluid .",
    "this simplification is absent in the compressible state since it is gapless .",
    "even though at the level of mean field theory the state is predicted to be a fermi liquid , the coupling of the fluctuations of the statistical gauge field turns the ( mean - field ) hlr state into a non - fermi liquid .",
    "thus , already at the leading perturbative order , imaginary part of the the composite fermion self - energy @xmath31 overwhelms the real part,@xcite i.e. @xmath32 for short - range interactions although it is milder for coulomb interactions , @xmath33 ( a `` marginal '' fermi liquid ) , and the composite fermion quasiparticles become ill - defined . in addition , a calculation of the landau parameters @xmath34 for the hlr theory@xcite revealed that , for all angular momentum channels @xmath35 , all the landau parameters are equal to the pomeranchuk value , @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , the quasiparticle picture breaks down and even the relic of a fermi surface appears to be prone to instabilities ( such as a nematic instability ) .",
    "current numerical estimates in the half - filled landau level yield negative values of @xmath29 and close to the pomeranchuk instability value.@xcite already the conventional theory of the nematic transition is non - trivial since at the pomeranchuk point the fermi liquid breaks down , and in the hlr state the fermi liquid picture has been already broken down due to the coupling to the fluctuating gauge field .",
    "nevertheless , properties of the fluid determined by gauge - invariant currents and densities are well behaved , in the sense that they are free of infrared singularities , although the results are at best qualitative since the theory does not have a small parameter.@xcite    a further complication is the lack of particle - hole symmetry in the hlr theory.@xcite this problem is the focus of intense current work.@xcite it has also been a focus of attention in the theory of the paired ( pfaffian ) fqh state.@xcite particle - hole symmetry in the half - filled landau level can exist only in the absence of landau level mixing and if only quadratic interactions are allowed . on the other hand , although the flux attachment transformation is an exact mapping , at the level of the average field approximation there is a large reorganization of the hilbert space which involves a large mixing of landau levels .",
    "for this reason the jain wave functions are projected onto the landau level . however , in the field theory approach there is no such projection .",
    "in the incompressible fqh states the effects of landau level mixing become negligible at long distances and at low energies provided that the quantum fluctuations ( `` one - loop '' or `` rpa '' ) are included , as a consequence of incompressibility , galilean and gauge invariance.@xcite the correct universal properties , encoded in the effective topological field theory , of the fqh states are reproduced only after these leading quantum corrections are included .",
    "these quantum corrections at long distance and at low energies turn the composite fermions into anyons with fractional charge and fractional statistics and , in this sense , there are no composite fermions in the spectrum of states of the fqh fluids . on the other hand , because of the absence of a small parameter , the theory yields quantitatively incorrect values for dimensionful ( and non - universal ) quantities , often by significant amounts although improvements have been made.@xcite these problems become more complex in the case of the hlr state and , for this reason , theories of the compressible state projected onto the landau level have been introduced.@xcite these theories are technically more complex and non - local , and are only qualitatively understood .",
    "in what follows we will set aside these important caveats , and develop a theory of the compressible nematic state as an instability of the hlr composite fermi liquid ( cfl ) state . in section [ sec : nematic - cfl ] we present the theory of the nematic composite fermi liquid , following closely the structure and results of the theory of the nematic fermi fluid of oganesyan , kivelson and fradkin,@xcite and of the composite fermi liquid of halperin , lee and read@xcite here we introduce the gauge - invariant quadrupolar interaction , and present the basic structure of the effective action for the nematic order parameter fields . in section [ sec : diagonal ]",

    "here we find that , due to the non - local nature of this term in the compressible state , not only its coefficient is not quantized ( as it is in the incompressible fqh state@xcite ) but its relation with the berry phase term for the nematic fields ( i.e. the effective hall viscosity of the cfl ) is not straightforward . in section [ sec : hydro ]",
    "we derive the geometrical response of the cfl and in particular the hall viscosity of this compressible fluid . here too , contrary to what happens in the fqh states , this response is not quantized and it is not universal . in section [ experiment ] , we discuss the connection of our theoretical results on the nematic cfl states with various experiments showing transport anisotropy in half - filled landau levels .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] is devoted to our conclusions and open questions .",
    "details of our calculations and of previous results are presented in the appendices . in appendix [ app : okf ]",

    "the action of eq .",
    "is the theory that we will analyze in this paper .",
    "this action now also contains a higher - order gradient term , @xmath55 , in the fermion dispersion needed to stabilize the nematic phase , i.e. , making the sign of the quartic term of the free energy of the nematic order parameter positive.@xcite however , we will be mainly interested in the leading scaling behaviors of the various correlators in @xmath56 and @xmath57 for small @xmath58 where we linearize the kinetic energy of the fermion near @xmath59 to calculate the correlators .",
    "then the higher - order dispersion does not affect the leading scaling behaviors of the dynamic properties of the correlators .",

    "we will also expand the effective action up to the quadratic order in the fluctuations of the chern - simons gauge field @xmath52 .",

    "different from the parity - even fermi surface where the metric only couples with the momentum current , the composite fermions carry intrinsic orbital spin so the spin connection appears in the covariant derivative .",
    "hence , @xmath230 the composite fermion current @xmath229 is bound with the spatial derivative of electric field of @xmath223 as @xmath231 .",
    "once we have a nonzero @xmath231 , a polarized charge density appears . if the hydrodynamic gauge theory of the gauge field @xmath223 contains a term like @xmath232 , the polarized charge density associated with the field @xmath223 acts as a magnetic moment which couples with magnetic flux of @xmath223 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath233 by solving the equation of motion for the hydrodynamic gauge field , @xmath234 we finally have @xmath235 thus the hall viscosity can be read off from @xmath236 i.e. , the hall viscosity is @xmath237 in which @xmath238 is due to the flux attachment,@xcite and @xmath239 is due to the parity - odd fluctuations of the hydrodynamic gauge field .",
    "the parity - odd viscosity has two contributions : one is the intrinsic orbital spin that the composite fermion carries , and the other is through the term @xmath240 of the hydrodynamic gauge field .",
    "hence , if the dual hydrodynamic gauge theory has the parity - odd @xmath241 term , we expect that there should be additional hall viscosity from the gauge fluctuation .",
    "the theory of the @xmath223 field can be obtained by integrating out the composite fermion surface and gauge fluctuation of the gapless @xmath28 . however , if the effective theory of @xmath28 is gapless and nonlocal , the coefficient @xmath90 for the term @xmath242 will be non - universal ( and depend on the uv cutoff in a singular way ) .",
    "this is in accordance with our result for the cfl .",
    "in this section , we discuss the connections between our results with the experiments@xcite on half - filled landau levels with @xmath243 .",
    "these experiments show that in half - filled landau levels with @xmath13 , there is a spectacular anisotropy in the longitudinal transport with ratios of the resistances as large as @xmath244 at the lowest temperatures .",
    "the anisotropy in the longitudinal resistivities , expressed in the difference @xmath245 , raises very rapidly below a critical temperature @xmath246mk ( for @xmath1 ) .",
    "these results were originally interpreted as the signature of a striped phase,@xcite an unidirectional charge - density - wave state which breaks translation symmetry ( and , necessarily , rotational symmetry . )",
    "however , further transport experiments showed that the @xmath247 ( current - voltage ) curves were metallic and showed a linear behavior at low bias voltages.@xcite in contrast , a charge - density - wave ( cdw ) would have exhibited non - linear @xmath247 curves with a sharp onset at a critical voltage .",
    "extremely sharp onset behavior has been seen indeed in the reentrant integer quantum hall regime away from the center of the landau level and has been interpreted as evidence for a  bubble phase \" ( i.e. a bidirectional cdw . ) moreover , in the reentrant iqh regime the experiments show broadband noise in the current , which are observed in many cdw phases , but which is absent the anisotropic half - filled landau levels .",
    "for these reasons , the experiments in the center of the landau levels ( with @xmath13 ) have been interpreted instead as evidence for a _",
    "nematic _ phase phase , i.e. a uniform and compressible phase of the 2deg with a strong anisotropy ( for a review see ref .",
    "this interpretation is further supported by comparing the anisotropy in transport data with a simple model of a nematic , a two - dimensional classical @xmath248 model for a director order parameter . by menas of monte carlo calculations",
    "it was found that indeed this model fits really well the transport anisotropy data.@xcite furthermore , these fits show that there is a very low energy scale for the native anisotropy is of the order of @xmath249mk , which is presumably related to the coupling of the 2deg to the underlying lattice .",
    "although the experiments can not exclude the possibility that the ground state at @xmath250 is actually a possible striped state , which will be melted thermally into a nematic state at finite temperature , the absence of any evidence of stripiness at the lowest temperatures seems to imply that the ground state is a nematic ( which , most likely , should be regarded as a quantum melted striped phase . ) a detailed review on these experiments ( prior to 2010 ) and their interpretation can be found in ref .",
    "in this section we focus on a relatively recent set of experiments on radio - frequency conductivity measurements in the @xmath1 landau level near filling fraction @xmath251 by sambandamurthy _",
    "_ et.al.__@xcite which , from our perspective , can be naturally interpreted as the following . in this experiment,@xcite",
    "they observe an anisotropy in the longitudinal conductivities as well as a resonant peak of the radio - frequency longitudinal conductivity along the hard direction of transport , say @xmath190 , with a frequency of @xmath252 mhz .",
    "this @xmath252 mhz resonance was originally interpreted as evidence for the existence of a pinning mode of a stripe state.@xcite given that the @xmath247 curves are linear , and hence that there is no evidence of translation symmetry breaking , it is natural to seek a nematic explanation for this energy gap . in a nematic state in the continuum there would not be a gap . on the other hand , the transport anisotropy experiments show that the anisotropy saturates below @xmath253mk .",
    "tilted - field experiments@xcite and the fits to the @xmath248 model with a weak symmetry - breaking field,@xcite show that the energy scale is of the order of @xmath249mk , which is quite comparable with a resonant frequency of @xmath252nhz as seen by sambandamurthy _ _",
    "et.al.__@xcite thus , we are led to the interpretation that the radio - frequency conductivity measurements are detecting a nematic goldstone mode gapped out by the coupling to the lattice which induces a term that breaks the continuous rotational symmetry to the @xmath254 symmetry of the lattice ( i.e. of the surface on which the 2deg is confined . )",
    "it is also important to note that the resonant peak seen in by sambandamurthy _ et.al .",
    "_ behaves remarkably close to what is seen in the transport anisotropy in the dc experiments .",
    "finally , we should note that transport experiments in the @xmath8 landau level have shown a close connection between the nematic state and the paired fqh state at @xmath9 .",
    "indeed , earlier experiments@xcite showed that by tilting the magnetic field the fqh state at @xmath9 is destroyed and that the resulting compressible state behaves much like an anisotropic hlr state .",
    "a relatively recent experiment@xcite has also given evidence of a nematic state in the @xmath10 fqh plateau ( presumably a laughlin - type state ) and was interpreted as such in several theory papers.@xcite very recent transport experiments by samkharadze _",
    "et.al._,@xcite found that , by applying a sufficiently large external hydrostatic pressure , the _",
    "incompressible _ isotropic fqh state at @xmath255 spontaneously gives a way to the compressible anisotropic phase .",
    "this is possible since the pressure tunes the width of the quantum well and thus tunes the effective interaction between the electrons , as the form and spread of the electron wavefunction will be varied as the width is changed . at the critical pressure",
    ", it is found that the rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken and the anisotropy in conductivities develops .",
    "though this transition is between _ incompressible _ qh state and _ compressible _ nematic cfl instead of the transition from the compressible isotropic state , namely cfl , to the compressible anisotropic state , this result gives a strong hint that tuning an external parameter , such as pressure , the effective electron interaction such as @xmath29 in this paper can be tuned to find the transition that we have studied in this paper .",
    "in this work , we considered the problem of a 2deg in a half - filled landau level with strong quadrupolar interactions .",
    "we mapped the fermion theory into a composite fermi liquid coupled to a gauge field with a chern simons term , extended by a quadrupolar interaction . both the nematic fluctuations and gauge fluctuations",
    "are found to soften the fermi surface and drive the system into a non - fermi liquid state .",
    "we started from the nematic fermi liquid theory corrected by the fluctuations of the chern - simons gauge boson fluctuations and looked at the nematic instability of the non - fermi liquid .",
    "the nematic fluctuations are landau - damped by the non - fermi liquid state and thus the dynamical critical exponent is @xmath70 .",
    "the nematic theory was also shown to contain a berry phase term arising from the gauge field fluctuations , which correct the nematic correlator .",
    "this non - zero berry phase term suggests the gauge fluctuation would also contribute to the hall viscosity of the half - filled landau level .",
    "the resulting odd viscosity in this gapless system is non - universal .",
    "in addition , inside the nematic phase , the nematic vortex current couples with the gauge field .",
    "this also demonstrates that the half - filled landau level orbital spin is not exactly equal to @xmath220 as both gauge fluctuation and orbital spin of the cfl in the mean field level have separate contribution to wen - zee term .",
    "the computation of the hall viscosity was confirmed by an argument based on a set of ward identities .",
    "the theory of the nematic composite fermi liquid presented here is based on the concept of flux attachment , i.e. on the equivalency between different theories of interacting fermions in two space dimensions to a theory of composite fermions coupled to a gauge field .",
    "this approach has been known for a long time to give the correct universal properties of the fqh states,@xcite including subtle responses to changes in the external geometry.@xcite these theories are also known to give a qualitative description of the compressible phases , i.e. the hlr theory.@xcite however , it is also well known that the mean field approximations based on this mapping involve a large amount of landau level mixing ( even in the limit of a very large magnetic field ) which becomes extreme in the compressible states .",
    "a symptom of these problems is the lack of particle - hole symmetry even in the limit in which all excited landau levels are projected out .",
    "these difficulties have been the focus of intense recent work,@xcite already noted in the introduction .",
    "this approach proposes to describe the half - filled landau level , instead , as proximate to a theory of dirac fermions `` dually '' coupled to a dynamical gauge field .",
    "the problem of the possible connection between the `` more conventional '' chern - simons approach and these recent proposals is at present unclear , including how they may relate to the nematic and paired states .",
    "we will consider these connections in a separate publication .",
    "finally we note that there have not been systematic numerical studies of the nematic transition in 2degs in large magnetic fields .",
    "most of the existing studies of rotational ( and translational ) symmetry breaking have been done either by means of finite - size diagonalizations@xcite ( done on small systems with toroidal boundary conditions which break rotational invariance explicitly ) or with projected wave functions @xcite or with variational wave functions , @xcite mostly done on relatively small systems on the sphere ( which also poses problems for an order that breaks rotational invariance ) .",
