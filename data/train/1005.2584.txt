    "the universe , as we observe it , is inhomogeneous almost at all scales .",
    "however , the standard approach , based on the cosmological principle , assumes that homogeneous models with robertson - walker ( rw ) geometry can be successfully employed in a cosmological framework , i.e. , above some @xmath1100 mpc scale .",
    "however , within such a framework , one needs to assume that the universe is filled with dark energy in order to achieve concordance with sne ia observations .",
    "but dark energy has never been directly observed neither in the universe , nor in laboratories , and it has very exotic properties , namely , it is a kind of gas with negative pressure or a mere cosmological constant with an amplitude too small to account for the vacuum energy in the standard model of particle physics .",
    "therefore , it is of the utmost importance to test whether the observations can be explained with models that do not require dark energy but that instead take inhomogeneities into account .",
    "a number of approaches have been suggested so far . among them",
    "the one patch spherically symmetric lematre ",
    "tolman models with a central observer @xcite , the thin shell approximations @xcite , the stephani models @xcite , and the szekeres models @xcite .",
    "however , all these approaches have their restrictions .",
    "for example , for the lematre - tolman model assuming spatial spherical symmetry around the observer , this symmetry has been turned into an argument stating that the observer s location at or near the symmetry center is too special as regards the requirement of the cosmological principle .",
    "now , we want to stress here that these models should not be considered as assuming we are living at or near the center of any spherically symmetric universe .",
    "they should merely be considered as a first step in the process of modeling cosmological inhomogeneities , i.e. , as a mere smoothing out of the inhomogeneities on angular scales , analogous to their smoothing out on the totality of space in homogeneous models .",
    "thus , the subsisting inhomogeneities are only radial .",
    "the use of such models must be merely regarded as a first approach which will be followed by more precise ways of dealing with the observed inhomogeneities .",
    "the stephani class of solutions are conformally flat @xcite and can not therefore constitute general models for the universe .",
    "the thin shell approximations are based on two rw models and are also spherically symmetric around the observer .",
    "the szekeres models are the most general ones , even if the five functions defining a model depend only on the radial coordinate .",
    "an improvement is to use swiss - cheese models .",
    "some models of this class where the holes were lematre ",
    "tolman patches have already been proposed in the literature @xcite . however , the results suggest that we need at least structures of several hundred mpc in order to reproduce the supernova data . in ref .",
    "@xcite the model proposed contains schwarzschild regions , each with the mass of a galaxy .",
    "the results suggest that such a geometry can not explain dark energy as an effect of inhomogeneities .",
    "we propose here a generalization of these approaches , where instead of lematre  tolman or schwarzschild patches , which are all spherically symmetric , we use szekeres models to represent the holes in the homogeneous cheese .",
    "the szekeres model has several advantages , like anisotropic density distribution which leads to a different evolution pattern than in the lematre ",
    "tolman model @xcite .",
    "thus there is a possibility that the szekeres swiss - cheese models can come up with a more realistic picture , where the inhomogeneities are no more spherical and therefore can give a more physical representation of our universe .",
    "however , for calculation simplicity and as a first step , we limit ourselves here to the study of an axially symmetric propagation of light through axially symmetric szekeres holes .",
    "the structure of the present paper is as follows .",
    "section [ sec3 ] is devoted to the presentation of the szekeres models and of the particular subclasses used in this paper . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , we give the residual hubble diagrams for the five axially symmetric quasi - spherical szekeres swiss - cheeses considered here and we compare them to the corresponding lematre  tolman models , to the @xmath2cdm model and to the actual data . in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] , we display our conclusions .",
    "the szekeres solutions @xcite are the most general solutions of einstein s equations one can obtain with a dust gravitational source .",
    "they have no symmetry , i.e. , no killing vector , and are therefore well - suited to describe a lumpy universe .",
    "their metric in comoving coordinates and synchronous time gauge is    @xmath3    where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are functions of @xmath6 to be determined by the field equations .",
    "there are two families of szekeres solutions .",
    "the first family , where @xmath7 ( here the prime denotes derivation as respect to @xmath8 ) is a simultaneous generalization of the friedmann and kantowski - sachs models .",
    "since it has found so far no application in cosmology , we do not discuss it here .",
    "the second family of solutions is obtained when @xmath9 .",
    "when the einstein equations are solved , its metric can be written , after a change of coordinates more convenient for our purpose @xcite ,    @xmath10    where @xmath11 , @xmath12 is a function of @xmath13 and @xmath8 and @xmath14 is a function of @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath15 , \\label{edef}\\ ] ] with @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , functions of @xmath8 .      as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ metsz2 ] ) , only @xmath19 allows the solution to have all the three friedmann limits ( hyperbolic , flat and spherical ) .",
    "this is induced by the requirement of the lorentzian signature of the metric .",
    "since we are interested in the friedmann limit of our model which we expect to become homogeneous at very large scales , i.e. , that of the last - scattering , we will focus only on the @xmath19 case .",
    "such a case is called the quasi - spherical szekeres model .",
    "its metric , obtained for @xmath19 , becomes    @xmath20    where @xmath21.\\ ] ] in the spherical coordinates , @xmath22 .    applying the einstein equations to the metric ( [ ds2 ] ) and assuming the energy momentum tensor is that of dust , the einstein equations reduce to the following two :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 , is an arbitrary function related to the density @xmath25 via : @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath2 is the cosmological constant and @xmath28 is an arbitrary function of @xmath8 .",
    "the 3d ricci scalar is @xmath29 the weyl curvature decomposed into its electric and magnetic part is @xmath30    as in the lematre ",
    "tolman model , the bang time function , @xmath31 , follows from ( [ vel ] ) : @xmath32 . \\label{tbf}\\ ] ]    since all the formulae given so far are covariant under coordinate transformations of the form @xmath33 , this means that one of the functions @xmath34 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath24 and @xmath31 can be fixed at our convenience by the choice of @xmath35 .",
    "hence , each szekeres solution is fully determined by only five functions of @xmath8 : in the following , we choose @xmath14 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath28 .      as a first step , and for simplification purpose , we consider here axially symmetric quasi - spherical szekeres models . actually , since in our swiss - cheese model described below , we use only radially directed light rays , it has been shown in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that this implies that the szekeres model should be axially symmetric .",
    "the simplest axially - symmetric szekeres model obeys    @xmath39 in this case the dipole axis is along @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( or in spherical coordinates along the directions @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) .    for the axially",
    "directed geodesics ( @xmath44 ) , we obtain from ( [ ds2 ] )    @xmath45    the plus sign is for @xmath46 and the minus sign for @xmath47 , with @xmath48 , the radial coordinate of the source and @xmath49 , the radial coordinate of the observer .    the redshift relation in this case is @xcite :    @xmath50    or equivalently :    @xmath51      as seen above ,",
    "in the case of axially directed geodesics the equations which describe light propagation simplify significantly .",
    "moreover , density fluctuations ( [ rho ] ) and curvature fluctuations [ eqs . ( [ 3dr ] ) and ( [ weyl ] ) ] are the largest along the axial axis ( @xmath52 - when a light ray passes through the origin @xmath53 , since @xmath54 is always multiplied by @xmath12 or @xmath55 which are zero at the origin thus there is no discontinuity here . ) .",
    "therefore in constructing our swiss - cheeses models we focus only on axial geodesics .",
    "when constructing a swiss cheese model , we need to satisfy the junction conditions for matching . here",
    "we match the szekeres inhomogeneity ( holes ) to the friedmann background ( cheese ) .",
    "these szekeres patches are placed so that their boundaries touch wherever a light ray exits one inhomogeneous patch .",
    "thus the ray immediately enters another szekeres inhomogeneity and does not spend any time in the friedmann background . to match a szekeres patch to a friedmann background across a comoving spherical surface , @xmath56 constant ,",
    "the conditions are : that the mass inside the junction surface in the szekeres patch is equal to the mass that would be inside that surface in the homogeneous background ; that the spatial curvature at the junction surface is the same in both the szekeres and friedmann models , which implies that @xmath57 and @xmath58 ; finally that the bang time and also @xmath2 must be continuous across the junction  unless otherwise stated we assume that @xmath59 .    besides matching the inhomogeneous patches we also need to take care of the null geodesics . however , as in this case we only consider axial geodesics the junction is trivial and requires only matching the radial , or equivalently the time component @xcite .",
    "we consider 3 different types of models with 3 different backgrounds .",
    "the first model consists of small - scale inhomogeneities within an open flrw model ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the others have larger patches within either an einstein - de sitter model or an open flrw model with @xmath61 .",
    "light propagation is obtained by solving eqs .",
    "( [ redrel ] ) .",
    "the luminosity distance is calculated as follows .",
    "first we solve for the angular diameter distance , @xmath62 , which is defined as @xcite :    @xmath63    where @xmath64 is the cross - sectional area of the bundle of null geodesics diverging from a radiation source , perpendicular to the propagation vector of light at a point with affine parameter @xmath65 and @xmath66 is the solid angle subtending this area .",
    "the rate of change of @xmath64 is given by @xcite :    @xmath67    where @xmath68 is the expansion of the family of null geodesics . using the sachs propagation equations @xcite    @xmath69    where @xmath70 is the riemann tensor , @xmath71 is the ricci tensor , @xmath72 , and a star denotes a complex conjugate . for axial geodesics @xmath73 . which implies that if initially @xmath74 then it will remain zero .",
    "therefore , the relation for the angular diameter distance is    @xmath75    finally using the reciprocity theorem @xcite the luminosity distance is @xmath76",
    "[ sec4 ]           we first study a swiss - cheese which can be considered as representing our local universe with voids of size around 50 mpc @xcite .",
    "let us consider the swiss - cheese model exhibiting holes each described by szekeres patches whose 5 arbitrary functions , @xmath28 , @xmath14 , @xmath38 , @xmath37 , and @xmath36 are of the following forms :    @xmath77 & { \\rm ~for~ } x_a \\leqslant   \\ell \\leqslant 3x_a \\\\   -m_1 ( \\ell - 4x_a)^3 & { \\rm ~for~ } 3x_a \\leqslant   \\ell \\leqslant   4x_a ,   \\\\ 0 &   { \\rm ~for~ } \\ell \\geqslant 4x_a ,   \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    where @xmath78/kpc , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath60 , @xmath81 km s@xmath82 mpc@xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 kpc .",

    "although the distribution of mass , i.e. the function @xmath24 is spherically symetric ( it only depends on @xmath8 ) , the density distribution , as seen from [ rho ] , is not .",

    "[ results ] show that , as in lematre ",
    "tolman models @xcite , small - scale inhomogeneities ( @xmath0 mpc ) do not alter the distance - redshift relation significantly , and thus can not fully explain away dark energy . to reproduce successfully the supernova dimming , we must consider larger structures of order 500 mpc , as in lematre ",
    "tolman swiss - cheeses @xcite .",
    "the presence of such large structures , in the framework of lematre  tolman models , can be ruled out by cmb constraints @xcite .",

    "the fact that in the studied cases we need large patches in order to explain supernova dimming without dark energy might be due to the axial symmetry of the models .",
    "actually , it has been shown , that structure formation is five times faster in some non axially symmetric szekeres models than in the corresponding lematre  tolman models @xcite . since we know , from @xcite , that the evolution of the inhomogeneities bends more the photon paths compared to the flrw case than their mere geometry , it should be interesting to investigate if another geometry of the holes might be able to enhance their evolution and therefore to have a stronger effect on the bending of the photon paths and , hence , on the supernova dimming",
