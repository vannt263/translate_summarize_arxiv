    "the value of the dimensionless spin parameter @xmath6 is zero in the schwarzschild limit ( non - rotating bh ) and one in the extreme kerr limit ( maximum rotational speed ) , so @xmath7 .",
    "the relative strain caused by any metric perturbation on the detector depends on the position of the bh in the sky and the relative orientation of its spin axis to the local zenith of the detector .",
    "the averaged strain produced by the tensorial gw components can be obtained by _",
    "rms _ averaging over all possible angles and the result is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the damping function that depends on the rotation speed and on the central frequency of the bh : @xmath10 for @xmath11 ( we set the time origin on @xmath12 ) .",
    "the amplitude @xmath13 also depends on the fraction @xmath14 of the total mass - energy radiated and on the bh distance from the earth ( @xmath15 ) , and it is given by @xmath16^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{mpc}}{r}\\right)\\left(\\frac{m}{m_\\odot}\\right ) \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{0.01}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}.\\ ] ]    the quality factor roughly gives the number of coherent cycles for the waveform @xcite .",
    "it affects the damping ( @xmath17 ) , which decreases with increasing rotational speed . to generate the signal that was introduced in the model of the detector we chose one ( among many ) of the sets of parameters that made the central frequency of the bh quadrupolar normal mode coincident with one of schenberg resonant quadrupolar frequencies ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) .",
    "[ fig : parameters ]     to @xmath20.,width=321 ]    we obtain a certain volume in the space of parameters shown in figure [ fig : parameters ] by fixing two boundary frequencies for the bh quadrupolar mode and then making those parameters to vary .",
    "consequently any set of parameters inside that volume is within schenberg bandwidth .",
    "we chose @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 to generate the signal that we used to calculate the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we believe that this efficiency is not overestimated since similar values have been found in the literature @xcite .",
    "[ fig : waveform ]    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     figure [ fig : waveform].a shows the waveform @xmath24 in the time domain .",
    "the fourier transform of the impulse @xmath24 is defined as @xmath25 it represents the signal in the frequency domain and is shown in figure [ fig : waveform].b .",
    "this figure shows that the signal spectrum on schenberg bandwidth ( @xmath26 ) is almost plane .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the low value for the bh s quality factor ( @xmath27 , for that simulated signal ) . for higher values of the quality factor",
    "the damping function tends to a sinusoid and a peak may appear in the spectrum .",
    "this would facilitate the detection of the signal .",
    "we modelled the schenberg detector by assuming a linear elastic theory . adopting this approach we determined the mechanical response of the system and obtained an expression for the case when",
    "six 2-mode mechanical resonators are coupled to the antenna s surface according to the arrangement suggested by johnson and merkowitz , the truncated icosahedron configuration @xcite .",
    "we found an analytic expression to calculate the spectral density for the mode channels , given by @xcite @xmath28 the scalar @xmath29 represents the transfer function of the sphere s internal forces @xmath30 at angular frequency @xmath31 on mode @xmath32 .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath33 correspond to the response functions of channel @xmath32 to the noise forces @xmath34 that are acting on the mode @xmath35 of resonator @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 denotes the spectral density of the quantity @xmath38 . in order to find equation [ eq : gspecdens ]",
    ", we assumed that all noise sources and possible signals were statistically independent so the cross terms could be neglected .",
    "the gw effective force @xcite that acts on the sphere ( in the frequency domain ) has spectral density @xmath39 the sensitivity curve for mode @xmath32 is given through @xmath40    [ fig : sens_1st_goal ]     for the quadrupolar normal modes @xmath32.,width=321 ]    figure [ fig : sens_1st_goal ] shows the sensitivity curves for the five quadrupolar normal modes of the sphere .",
    "we obtained this curve assuming that no signal was present and that only the usual noises in this kind of detector ( brownian noise , serial noise , back - action noise and electronic phase and amplitude noises ) were disturbing the antenna at @xmath41 .",
    "the absence of a signal made filtering unnecessary in this calculation . also , we assumed a perfectly symmetric sphere , which implies identical transfer functions @xmath29 .",
    "asymmetries on the sphere could make the transfer function of a mode different from the transfer function of the others .",
    "using the results in sections [ sec : signal ] ( which inform about the signal ) and [ sec : model ] ( which inform about the noise ) it is easy to calculate the integrated signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath42 ) . from the literature",
    "@xcite we have @xmath43 the integral in equation [ eq : snr ] , which is dominated by the interval of schenberg bandwidth , gives @xmath44 for the simulated signal when the bh s distance is @xmath45 .",
    "if a low - spinning bh ( @xmath46 ) with mass @xmath47 and emission of about @xmath48 of its mass - energy in the form of gw exists up to a distance of @xmath0 , then the schenberg detector is expected to observe it when operating at @xmath41 .    in the calculation",
    "we did nt take into account other possible dependencies on the bh parameters except the known frequency - mass dependence .",
    "strong dependencies between @xmath14 and @xmath6 may make signals from high - spinning bhs much stronger .",
    "there are theories that claim the existence of bhs but experimental evidences are indirect and inconclusive .",
    "certainly it is not yet possible to predict the correct number of galactic bhs .",
    "however , the radius of @xmath0 includes the galactic center and the majority of the spiral arms , which are the most probable birthplaces for stellar bhs .",
    "so the detection of the kind of signal investigated in this work is an opportunity for gravitational wave astronomers to make essential discoveries about the black hole population in our galaxy ."
