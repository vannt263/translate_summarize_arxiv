    "the  observatory has been carrying out pointed observations of the x - ray sky for more than a decade .",
    "the  serendipitous source catalog @xcite provides various properties of serendipitously detected x - ray sources , in addition to targets , from these pointed observations .",
    "it has been updated regularly , and the latest version as of the writing of this paper is the 2xmmi - dr3 catalog , containing 353191 x - ray source detections for 262902 unique x - ray sources .",
    "it is the largest x - ray source catalog ever produced .",
    "such catalogs are rich resources for exploring a variety of x - ray source populations and identifying rare source types ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "compared with other large x - ray catalogs such as the _ rosat _ catalogs from its all - sky survey ( rass ) and pointed observations and the chandra source catalog @xcite , the 2xmmi - dr3 catalog has several advantages because of the large effective area , high spatial resolution , and/or broad energy band coverage of the  observatory .    in this paper",
    ", we select a sample of sources of the best quality from the 2xmmi - dr3 catalog and study their properties in detail .",
    "we first establish a subsample of these sources whose types are known and study their x - ray spectral shapes , x - ray variability , and x - ray - to - optical and x - ray - to - ir flux ratios . based on these properties ,",
    "we define some quantitative criteria to classify other sources .",
    "sources with interesting properties , discovered as a part of this work are the subject of a companion paper .",
    "we devote significant effort to visually screen the results so as to reduce various kinds of systematic errors .    in section  [ sec : reduction ]",
    ", we describe the source selection procedure , the calculation of the flux and the hardness ratio , the search for stellar x - ray flares , the measurement of the long - term variability , the source classification from the literature , the search for optical and ir counterparts , the determination of the ( extra)galactic nature , and simple spectral fits .",
    "the properites of the sources with known types are shown in section  [ sec : res ] .",
    "the scheme that we propose to classify sources is given in section  [ sec : clsscrit ] .",
    "the results of applying this scheme to the sources with unknown types are presented in section  [ sec : srcuid ] .",
    "the discussion and conclusions of our study are given in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the 2xmmi - dr3 catalog is based on 4953 pointed observations .",
    "these observations have a variety of modes of data acquisition , exposures ( @xmath11000 s ) , and optical blocking filters ( thick , medium , and thin ) .",
    "the catalog contains detections in five basic individual energy bands ( 0.20.5 , 0.51.0 , 1.02.0 , 2.04.5 , and 4.512.0 kev , numbered 15 , respectively ) , for each european photon imaging camera ( epic ) , i.e. , pn , mos1/m1 , and mos2/m2 @xcite .",
    "results are also given for various combinations of energy bands and cameras .",
    "band 8 refers to the total band 0.212.0 kev , and epic / ep refers to all cameras .",
    "we also follow these notations throughout this paper .",
    "we focused only on point sources with multiple  observations and at least one detection with the signal - to - noise ratio s / n @xmath220 in this paper .",
    "we considered only point sources because extended sources ( typically galactic supernova remnants ( snrs ) and galaxy clusters ) tend to be subject to complicated problems of source detection and flux measurement @xcite .",
    "we define a source to be point - like when its extent ( ` ep_extent ` in the catalog ) is zero ( at least in one detection ) .",
    "we note that in the pipeline , if the extent radius in a detection is @xmath36@xmath4 , it is set to zero , i.e. , a point source is assumed .",
    "we estimated the s / n using ` ep_8_cts`/`ep_8_cts_err ` , where ` ep_8_cts ` , given in the catalog , is the total counts summed over all cameras , and ` ep_8_cts_err ` is its error .",
    "our requirement of having at least one detection with s / n @xmath220 is to ensure at least one good spectrum for detailed analysis when needed .",
    "the requirement of having multiple observations allows us to calculate the long - term variability .",
    "it is different from the requirement of having multiple detections .",
    "the catalog includes only detections with a total likelihood ( from all bands and all cameras ) @xmath1 6 ( corresponding to about @xmath5 ) .",
    "we used the service ` http://www.ledas.ac.uk/flix/flix.html ` to find the observations of a source and estimate the fluxes for the observations that have no entries in the catalog .",
    "there are 5802 sources satisfying the above conditions .",
    "however , as the catalog was produced using an automated procedure , some of these sources suffer from various kinds of problems , and we excluded them based on visual inspection .",
    "about 16% are spurious , mostly due to single reflections caused by bright sources outside the field of view , out - of - time events , and extremely bright sources @xcite .",
    "we also excluded about 8% of the sources that are detected within bright extended sources , especially snrs , though they pass the above criteria .",
    "about 2% of the sources are finally excluded due to problems such as optical loading , serious event pileup , and being too close to other bright sources .    in the catalog , each source has a unique source number ( ` srcid ` in the catalog ) .",
    "however , from visual inspection , we still found 42 sources assigned with multiple srcid numbers ( table  [ tbl : merge - src ] ) .",
    "each source will be referred to using the first number in table  [ tbl : merge - src ] , but its detections consist of all the detections corresponding to the different srcid numbers ( table  [ tbl : a1 ] ) . in the end , we have 4330 unique sources in our sample ( table  [ tbl : dercat ] ) .",

    "the count rates were corrected for various instrumental effects including the mirror vignetting , detector efficiency and point spread function losses .",
    "the fluxes in individual energy bands were calculated by dividing the count rates by the energy conversion factors ( ecfs ) .",
    "the ecfs depend on the camera , the filter , and the source spectrum , which the catalog assumed to be an absorbed power - law ( pl ) with a photon index of @xmath6 and an absorption column density of @xmath7 @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the ecfs used in the catalog were based on the calibration before 2008 , except for a few observations .",
    "we applied correction factors provided on the catalog website to obtain fluxes corresponding to the newer calibration . in this paper , we mostly used the epic fluxes in 0.212.0 kev ( band 8) and 0.24.5 kev ( called band 14 hereafter ) .",
    "they were obtained by first summing the fluxes in the relevant individual bands and then averaging over the available cameras weighted by the errors .",
    "we estimated their systematic errors to be 0.107 and 0.074 , respectively ( appendix  [ sec : fhrerr ] ) .",
    "we also calculated four x - ray hardness ratios hr1hr4 defined as @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the mos1-medium - filter equivalent count rates in the energy bands @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "these count rates were obtained by multiplying the epic fluxes by the ecfs for the mos1 camera with the medium filter .",
    "we note that the 2xmmi - dr3 catalog also provides the camera - specific x - ray hardness ratios , but the count rates used , and thus the hardness ratios , depend on the camera and the filter .",
    "this poses a problem to use the hardness ratios to investigate the source spectral shape uniformly , considering that the observations used to create the catalog have various filters and available cameras .",
    "our hardness ratios are less subject to this problem , as the fluxes have been calculated to mitigate their dependence on the camera and filter by using the camera- and filter - dependent ecfs .",
    "we only observed small systematic differences between the pn and mos hardness ratios using our definition ( appendix  [ sec : fhrerr ] ) .",
    "the variability properties can provide important clues about the source type .",
    "there are many kinds of variability .",
    "for the short - term variability that can be measured within a single observation , we paid attention to stellar x - ray flares , which are good indicators of coronally active stars @xcite .",
    "they show a variety of profiles , though most of them have a fast rise and a slow decay and can last from minutes to hours .",
    "the light curves created for bright detections by the pipeline are suitable for stellar x - ray flare search .",
    "they are extracted from a circular region of radius @xmath14 and have bin sizes an integer multiple of 10 s ( the minimum is 10 s ) , depending on the source intensity @xcite .",
    "we describe our search for stellar x - ray flares in appendix  [ sec : flaresearch ] .",
    "we also measured the long - term flux variability over different observations . both bands",
    "14 and 8 were used , but we will explore results with band 14 in more detail because the flux in band 5 ( 4.512.0 kev ) tends to have large uncertainties .",
    "we defined the long - term flux variability as @xmath15 and the significance of the difference as @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the maximum and minimum epic fluxes of a unique source , with the corresponding ( statistical ) errors @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively , and @xmath21 is the systematic error ( @xmath22 and 0.074 for bands 8 and 14 , respectively ; section  [ sec : refhr ] ) .",
    "we only used detections with the flux above four times the error ( @xmath23 ) when calculating @xmath17 , while we used @xmath24 as the flux for detections with the flux less than @xmath24 when calculating @xmath18 .",

    "the other common case is stars with large proper motions ( indicated in the usno - b1.0 catalog ) . in the end we found optical and ir counterparts for 3014 ( 70% ) and 2058 ( 48% ) of our sources , respectively ( table  [ tbl : dercat ] ) .",
    "for very few sources , we denoted the match quality as bad due to their coincidence with the persistence artifact positions in the 2mass , bright globular clusters , etc . and we will not explore their optical / ir properties .",

    "all fluxes are in units of erg  s@xmath26  @xmath8 and correspond to apparent / absorbed values .",
    "we also similarly cross - correlated our sources with the extended ir sources from the 2mass extended source catalog ( 2mass xsc , * ? ? ? * ) and the optical sources from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "we used them mostly to check whether our sources are coincident with the center of ( extended ) galaxies . to reduce the contamination ,",
    "we only assumed extended ir sources from the 2mass xsc to be galaxies when they are coincident with the center of an optical extended source , based on visual inspection of the digital sky survey ( dss ) images . for the sdss extended sources , we assumed them to be galaxies if their @xmath21-band magnitudes are @xmath120 ( the separation between the point and extended sources by the sdss pipeline is not reliable for very faint sources ( see * ? ? ? * ) ) .",
    "we used the third reference catalog ( rc3 ) of galaxies @xcite to investigate the probability of our sources being non - nuclear extragalactic sources .",
    "this catalog is reasonably complete for galaxies having apparent diameters larger than 1@xmath34 at the @xmath35 isophotal level and total @xmath36-band magnitudes brighter than about 15.5 and redshifts less than 0.05 .",
    "the @xmath35 isophote refers to the 25 mag arcsec@xmath37 @xmath36-band isophote and is approximated as an ellipse .",
    "this catalog also includes some objects of special interest , resulting in 23,022 galaxies in total .",
    "it gives the apparent major and minor diameters and the position angle of the @xmath35 isophote for each galaxy .",
    "the @xmath35 isophote is roughly the domain of a galaxy as seen in the dss images , and by comparing the source positions with this isophote we can check whether the sources are possibly associated with that galaxy .",
    "following @xcite , we calculated the angular separation @xmath38 between the galaxy center and the source , which was then scaled by the elliptical radius @xmath39 of the @xmath35 isophotal ellipse in the direction from the galaxy center to the source .",
    "we assumed that only sources with @xmath40@xmath32 and @xmath38@xmath14@xmath4 can possibly be non - nuclear extragalactic sources .",
    "the positions of the galaxy centers given in the rc3 have only modest accuracy .",
    "we found that the positions from nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) are closer to the real galaxy centers ( at least for galaxies related to our sources ) based on visual inspection of dss images .",
    "thus we chose to use the galaxy center positions from ned when possible .",
    "we also estimated the maximum 0.212.0 kev absorbed luminosity for each candidate non - nuclear extragalactic source .",
    "we adopted the distances to most galaxies used in @xcite and @xcite . for 17 other galaxies",
    ", we obtained their distances using the redsifts from ned and assuming a flat universe with the hubble constant @xmath41=75 km s@xmath26 mpc@xmath26 and the matter density @xmath42=0.27 if they have recessional velocities larger than 1000 km  s@xmath26 or from the literature otherwise .",
    "we created simple energy spectra , one for each available camera for each detection , using the count rates in five basic energy bands in the 2xmmi - dr3 catalog and fitted them with an absorbed pl ( table  [ tbl : a1 ] ) .",
    "the response files corresponding to the `` thin '' , `` medium '' , and `` thick '' optical blocking filters were constructed using the observations 0112560101 , 0204870101 , and 0311190101 , respectively , from source regions centering at the pointing direction and covering the whole field of view .",
    "sas 11.0.0 and the calibration files of 2011 june were used .",
    "the event selection criteria for each energy band / camera used for source detection in @xcite were followed .",
    "the interstellar medium absorption was modeled by the wabs model in xspec .",
    "a systematic error of 10% on the model was assumed .",
    "relative normalizations among different cameras were allowed to be free .",
    "we note that we used the pl model just to roughly characterize the spectral shape .",
    "the real detailed x - ray spectra of agn are still often described by this model when there are no strong soft excesses , but for stars , the apec and mekal models in xspec are generally needed to describe their detailed x - ray spectra well .",
    "we show the spatial distribution of the identified sources in galactic coordinates in figure  [ fig : xraycoormap ] ( left panel ) and their distributions with respect to the galactic latitude @xmath43 ( right panel ) .",
    "we differentiate stars , agn , and compact objects .",
    "we note that in the sky map in the left panel some fields are too crowded to see the real number of sources , while the distributions on the right panel complement this information .",
    "the bin sizes in the distribution plots vary to correspond to an equal spatial area .",
    "the error bars shown were obtained by assuming poisson statistics in each bin ( this is also assumed for all other distribution plots throughout this paper ) .",
    "we see that there are many stars near @xmath44 , which is due to the orion nebula ( about 42% of the identified stars are from this nebula ) .",
    "apart from this field , the identified stars concentrate at low galactic latitudes .",
    "stars with high galactic latitudes are also seen ( about 31% with @xmath45 , excluding those from the orion nebula ) .",
    "stars are typically in the galactic plane .",
    "the large spread of stars along the galactic latitude in our sample indicates that they are nearby .",
    "the identified agn tend to be at high galactic latitudes , only about 2% with @xmath46 .",
    "such a bias can be explained by the large absorption along the galactic plane and the preference to target the region outside the galactic plane in galaxy surveys , such as the sdss .",
    "there are more identified agn from the northern galactic hemisphere ( about 68% with @xmath47 while about 30% with @xmath48 ) , which can be explained by the fact that many agn in our sample are discovered by the sdss , whose sky access is primarily in the north .",
    "the identified compact objects clearly concentrate near the low galactic latitude region , about 47% with @xmath49 .",
    "the excess of the identified compact objects in the region of @xmath50 is due to the presence of lmc and smc .",

    "apec is a model of the emission spectrum from collisionally - ionized diffuse gas in xspec and is often used to model the x - ray spectra of stars . in the hr1-hr2 diagram , we see that most stars occupy a region with characteristic apec temperatures about 0.51 kev . however , in the hr2-hr3 and hr3-hr4 diagrams , there are many stars in a region with apec temperatures @xmath11 kev , which means that these stars probably need multiple apec components to describe them .",
