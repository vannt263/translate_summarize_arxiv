    "the ebl reflects the cosmologically important time - integrated history of light production and re - processing in the universe .",
    "for this reason , measuring its intensity is highly desirable .",
    "the two components of the ebl are dust emission peaking at @xmath0 and starlight peaking at @xmath1 .",
    "the actual level of the ebl is very difficult to measure , due to the dominance of foreground emission , mostly from interplanetary dust in our solar system ( for reviews see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the ebl level remains unknown within a factor of @xmath2 few .",
    "model - independent lower limits to the ebl , based on galaxy counts ( e.g. dole et al .",
    "2006 , bthermin et al .",
    "2010 ) , are the only strict lower limits on the ebl to date . modeling the ebl can lead to definite prediction , however uncertainties in the star formation rate , initial mass function , dust extinction , and how they evolve with redshift , has led to significant discrepancy among models @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed a new method based on detecting as gev emission ebl radiation that has been inverse compton - scattered by relativistic electrons in the lobes of nearby radio galaxies such as fornax  a.    the ebl in the 1 - 10 @xmath3 m range can in principle be obtained by using the tev blazars as background light sources and modeling its attenuation due to pair production with ebl photons : by assuming that the intrinsic tev spectrum is known from modeling of the broadband blazar sed , one can derive the mid - ir ebl by comparing the observed to the presumed intrinsic spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "because it is not possible to determine with confidence the intrinsic tev spectrum , a variation of this method has been proposed that sets limits on the ebl by assuming that the intrinsic blazar tev spectrum can not be arbitrarily hard : from simple shock acceleration arguments one would not expect an intrinsic tev photon index harder than @xmath4 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "detailed shock acceleration simulations , however , indicate that harder vhe spectral indices may be possible @xcite . a large lower electron lorentz factor @xcite , and compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background in an extended jet",
    "may also lead to hard tev spectra @xcite .",
    "these considerations significantly relax the ebl limits derived by assuming @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "methods that constrain the ebl through purely spectral arguments are free of the uncertainties of adopting a particular physical model .",
    "such methods , based solely on tev data , have been proposed by @xcite , who considered unnatural tev seds that exhibit an exponential increase at their high energy end and by @xcite who assumed that all tev blazars in flaring states have tev spectra with the same maximum intrinsic photon index @xmath6 . here",
    "we present a spectral method for obtaining upper limits to the ebl energy density that makes use of simultaneous lat and tev observations . in ",
    "[ method ] we describe our method and apply it to recent simultaneous lat and tev observations observations of pks  2155 - 304 , in  [ disc ] we discuss how we can produce stronger constraints on the ebl and demonstrate this using simultaneous gev / tev observations of 1es 1218 + 304 , and in  [ conc ] we conclude .",
    "our current observational understanding of blazars points toward a sed that consists of two spectral components or more colloquially `` bumps '' . the first bump peaks at ir to x - ray energies and it is almost certainly synchrotron emission from a population of relativistic electrons in a partially ordered magnetic field .",
    "the second bump peaks at mev to multi - gev energies and is thought to be due to inverse compton scattering of synchrotron photons @xcite , a dusty torus @xcite , a broad - line region @xcite , or an accretion disk @xcite . for the blazars that have been discovered so far",
    ", this second bump ranges in power between @xmath7 times the power of the synchrotron bump .",
    "it is also possible that the high energy bump is a result of emission from hadrons co - accelerated with the jet , which can radiate by hadronic synchrotron @xcite or photomeson production @xcite and the resulting cascades .",
    "protons may also convert to neutrons , escape the relativistic jet , then convert back to protons and radiate @xcite .",
    "so far , no observational evidence for a third , higher energy bump has been found and we consider it unlikely that a third sed component at tev energies will be more powerful than the extrapolation of the gev sed at tev energies .",
    "our working assumption is motivated by these considerations and is weaker than the statement that there is no third sed bump : _ we assume that the extrapolation of the fermi - detected sed at tev energies is higher than the intrinsic tev sed of the source_. this means that the ratio of the actually observed tev flux @xmath8 to the extrapolated one @xmath9 at any given tev energy @xmath10 , provides a strict upper limit @xmath11 to the ebl - induced pair absorption optical depth at this energy , @xmath12 this optical depth can then be compared to the optical depth calculated for the various ebl models .",
    "the models for which the optical depth is greater that @xmath13 are then excluded .",
    "an important consideration for our method stems from the mismatch of the relatively long time required to obtain a sufficiently good sed of typical tev blazars with _ fermi _ ( no less than @xmath2 a day ) to the significantly smaller variability time observed by tev telescopes ( in some cases lasting less than an hour , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is clear that , because we want to compare simultaneous spectra , the tev fluxes observed during the rapid tev variability events seen in tev sources should not be used together with the _ fermi _ sed derived after integrating for days .",
    "the blazar pks  2155 - 304 , a high peak frequency bl lac object at redshift @xmath14 , was the target of a multiwavelength campaign in late august and early september 2008 , which included observations by the _ fermi _",
    "gamma - ray space telescope and the hess atmospheric cherenkov telescope @xcite .",
    "it is these observations to which we now turn our attention .",
    "the @xmath15-ray sed from this campaign can be seen in fig .",
    "[ sed2155 ] .",
    "@xcite found that the _ fermi _ sed derived from data between mjd 54704 - 54715 , the period of the tev observations , can be described by a simple power law with spectral index @xmath16 .",
    "a longer train of _ fermi _ observations between mjd 54682 - 54743 exhibits a similar gev state .",
    "if one includes these data , the exposure increases by a factor of @xmath17 and the preferred gev spectrum is now a broken power law , whose high energy part has a photon index @xmath18 @xcite . while a conservative estimate of the photon index used for obtaining an upper limit to the tev flux is that derived from the simultaneous observations only , the lack of strong variability in the gev ( as well as the tev ) regime , suggests that it is reasonable to adopt the high energy photon index as a better description .",
    "the single power - law , with spectral index @xmath16 and high energy power - law fit , @xmath18 of the broken power - law are shown as `` bow tie '' error plots in fig .",
    "[ sed2155 ] , extrapolated to the hess energy range .",
    "these extrapolations are used as upper limits to the intrinsic flux of the tev sed , unabsorbed by the ebl . the upper limit on @xmath19",
    "is calculated from equation ( [ taumax ] ) for these two extrapolations , and the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ tauebl2155 ] along with the absorption optical depth predictions of several ebl models .",
    "as expected , the steeper gev index provides stronger constraints to the ebl models .",
    "note that the fast evolution model of stecker et al .",
    "2006 lies below the @xmath20 limit on @xmath19 at the highest tev energy for @xmath18 and , in fact , is inconsistent with it at the @xmath21 level .",
    "we now discuss how the yield of our method can be maximized .",
    "we base our discussion on the fact that _ fermi _ is continuously monitoring the entire sky , including the extragalactic tev sources . to facilitate our discussion consider a source that has a lat spectral index @xmath22 and a tev spectral index @xmath23 ( spectral indexes @xmath24 are connected to photon indexes @xmath25 through the relation @xmath26 ) .",
    "let us further assume that the transition between the two power laws takes place at an energy @xmath27 gev , practically the energy border between lat and ground based tev telescopes .",
    "then at an energy @xmath28 within the tev regime , the flux one would expect by extrapolating the lat spectrum is @xmath29 , while the flux @xmath30 we actually observe at energy @xmath28 is @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the flux at energy @xmath33 .",
    "this means that the maximum pair production optical depth @xmath34 that we can infer from observations of this source is @xmath35 note that since @xmath34 increases with @xmath28 , the higher the tev energy in which a source is detected , the stronger the constraints will be .",
    "as expected , the smaller the spectral break @xmath36 of a source is , the stronger the resulting constraint on @xmath34 will be .",
    "therefore , at a given redshift @xmath37 , the most promising sources are those that exhibit the smallest @xmath38 .",
    "if a source varies , states with the smallest @xmath38 will provide the strongest constraints .",
    "we discuss this further below .",
    "a general pattern observed in both the low and high energy bumps of blazar seds is that variability events usually manifest themselves with a hardening of the high energy part / tail of the bump ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with the amplitude of variability decreasing at progressively lower energies .",
    "it is , therefore , natural to anticipate that when a tev blazar is in a high state , the spectrum will harden and rise in amplitude more at tev than at gev energies ( variability can explain the fact that in some variable sources like mrk 421 or s5 0716 + 714 the extrapolation of the gev sed of a given non - flaring epoch to tev energies @xcite can be below the actually detected tev emission at flaring states ) .",
    "this means that in a flaring state the method will provide more severe limits on ebl models .    as a potential example of the benefits of catching a source at a high state",
    ", we return to the case of pks 2155 - 304 , whose tev flux in the august - september 2008 _ fermi_-_hess _ campaign was close to the lowest archival tev data .",
    "the source exhibited a spectral break @xmath39 ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) . in a pre-_fermi",
    "_ 2006 campaign @xcite , the tev spectral index during flaring states hardened up to @xmath42 . if a similarly hard tev spectrum is recorded simultaneously with _",
    "fermi _ observations and if the _ fermi _ spectrum does not harden significantly , then @xmath43 , which would reduce @xmath44 by a factor of @xmath45 , posing important constraints on the ebl ( all the @xmath19 upper limits in figure [ tauebl2155 ] would shift downward by a factor of @xmath46 ) .",
    "the ideal high states should last long enough to provide us with a solid determination of the _ fermi _ flux and photon index .",
    "in addition , the source should remain relatively steady while in the high flux state , so that the average _ fermi _ and tev measurements are a good representation of the source during this high but not rapidly variable state .",
    "a high level of gev flux is also very useful , because if there is curvature in the _ fermi _ band , it is possible that a broken power law fit will be better than a simple power law and one can then use the higher energy steeper part of the _ fermi _ sed to extrapolate to tev energies and produce lower values of @xmath44 ( as we did for pks 2155 - 304 ) .",
    "even if there are sources described by pure power laws in the entire gev - tev regime without the need for a break , their observed spectra would be imprinted with a break solely attributed to ebl absorption .",
    "such breaks would increase with increasing redshift . in the more pragmatic case that there is a distribution of intrinsic breaks , then , as the blazar sequence ( fossati et al .",
    "1998 ) suggests , the breaks should become stronger for the more powerful sources seen at higher redshifts , because the peak frequency of the high energy component shifts to lower energies as the source power increases .",
    "the increase of @xmath47 with redshift would thus be a convolution of two effects : the blazar - sequence - like shift of the tev spectrum to steeper values ( which is intrinsic ) and the increase of ebl absorption with distance .",
    "if @xmath47 is dominated by the former , our method would derive its strongest ebl constraints from nearby sources . if , however , the intrinsic increase of the break with redshift is small or negligible , sources at higher redshifts , even with steep tev spectra ( the most distant example is 3c 279 discovered by magic @xcite at @xmath48 with @xmath49 ) , would provide us with strong constraints on the ebl . because we do not actually know the intrinsic breaks of the tev sources , the question that naturally arises is under what conditions higher redshift sources with steep tev spectra can provide as useful constraints on the ebl as their nearby siblings that have significantly harder tev spectra .",
    "the important thing to notice here is that the relevant quantity that constrains the ebl is not @xmath44 , but @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the luminosity distance of the source : sources with the same value of @xmath50 will provide the same constraints on the ebl ( assuming that the evolution in the ebl energy density itself with redshift is negligible for small redshifts ) .",
    "this means that , for fixed values of @xmath33 and @xmath28 , a particular constraint on the ebl is satisfied for sources with a fixed value of @xmath52 .",
    "more distant sources with larger breaks @xmath47 will provide the same constraints as more nearby sources , as long as they have the same @xmath52 .",
    "as an example , let us use as a reference the state of pks 2155 - 304 we discussed above , with @xmath39 and @xmath53 mpc .",
    "a source at the distance of mrk 421 ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 mpc ) will provide the same constraints on the ebl if it exhibits @xmath56 .",
    "any break greater than @xmath57 will not be as constraining as the stronger break of the more distant pks 2155 - 304 .",
    "going to higher redshifts , the more distant tev bl lac 1es 1218 + 304 @xcite ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 mpc ) would provide the same constraints on the ebl if it exhibits @xmath60 . breaks gentler than that will produce stronger constraints on the ebl than those derived from the state of pks 2155 - 304 we studied here .",
    "recently , it has been reported that pks 1218 + 304 has been observed by veritas from 2008 december 29 to 2009 april 23 ( acciari et al .",
    "this is quasi - simultaneous to the lat observation of the source in the 11 month _",
    "fermi_-lat catalog ( a. abdo et al . 2010 in preperation ) , which continuously exposed pks 1218 + 304 from 2008 august 4 to 2009 july 4 .",
    "these lat and veritas spectra give @xmath61 indicating they can provide a stronger constraint on ebl models .    following the same procedure as in the case of pks 2155 - 304 , we plot in figure [ sed1218 ] the @xmath15-ray sed , together with the ` bow tie ' extrapolation of the gev spectrum to veritas energies .",
    "as before , the extrapolation is used as an upper limit to the intrinsic flux of the tev sed and the upper limit on @xmath19 is calculated from equation ( [ taumax ] ) and plotted in fig .",
    "[ tauebl1218 ] along with the absorption optical depth predictions of several ebl models . as can be seen ,",
    "_ the fast evolution model of @xcite lies below the @xmath20 upper limit on @xmath19 for all but the two lowest tev energies , and below the @xmath62 level at the highest tev energy .",
    "in particular , the highest point ( @xmath63 tev ) is inconsistent with stecker s fast evolution model at @xmath64 .",
    "also the @xcite baseline model , and the @xcite best fit model are inconsistent at the @xmath65 level and @xmath66 level with @xmath44 at the highest tev energy . _",
    "we presented a simple , model - independent method for setting upper limits to the ebl .",
    "our method is based on the assumption that the level of the intrinsic tev emission of blazars is below the extrapolation of the lat sed to tev energies .",
    "we applied our method to pks 2155 - 304 and 1es 1218 + 304 , the only two tev blazars of known redshift for which published simultaneous lat - tev observations currently exist .",
    "even with these first applications of our method , the highest level ebl models are disfavored .",
    "future lat - tev simultaneous observations hold the promise of pushing the ebl upper limits much further .",
    "we argued that it is important to devote tev time not only to nearby sources , but also to more distant sources , hoping in both cases to observe high tev states that for a given source will exhibit smaller gev to tev spectral break @xmath47 , and will , therefore , produce stronger constraints .    because the most difficult observations to obtain are in the tev band , requests to monitor particular sources with tev facilities can be triggered from _",
    "fermi _ observations of high states of tev sources .",
    "a complementary approach is x - ray monitoring of the tev blazars . in this case , because the x - ray emission of most tev blazars is the high energy tail of the synchrotron component , high x - ray states are , in general , a good proxy for high tev states ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "such x - ray monitoring holds the promise of catching states in which , while the gev emission does not increase substantially , the tev emission does .",
    "we note here that our method assumes that the entire spectral break from the lat to the tev bands is due to ebl pair production absorption .",
    "this is an extreme assumption and it is highly probable that a substantial fraction of the break is intrinsic to the source .",
    "this in turn means that the actual level of the ebl may be significantly lower than the upper limits produced by our method .",
    "it would be very exciting and possibly hinting to new physics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) if the lowest collective values of @xmath44 that our method will produce , challenge the lower level on the ebl inferred by galaxy counts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
