    "and @xmath6 , respectively . [ fresnel_contrast],width=302 ]    the two main types of dws for films possessing out - of - plane anisotropy , bloch and nel , are sketched in figure  [ fresnel_contrast](a ) in plan view .",
    "the bloch wall creates charges only at the top and bottom edges of the film , which are well separated for walls of any significant length , but is divergence - free otherwise .",
    "in contrast to this , the nel wall gives rise to positive and negative magnetic charges along the whole length of the dw , separated by the dw width @xmath7 , which is of the order of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the exchange stiffness and @xmath10 is the anisotropy constant .",
    "thus the bloch wall is energetically favoured in perpendicularly magnetized thin films on magnetostatic grounds . to rotate the magnetic moments from the bloch into the nel configuration , an in - plane anisotropy expressed as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the demagnetizing factor@xcite that depends on the dw width @xmath7 and film thickness @xmath13 , has to be overcome .",
    "this can be achieved either by applying an external magnetic field in the @xmath14-direction@xcite , or by an effective magnetic field arising from the dmi@xcite .     sample . *",
    "( * a * ) at normal incidence , @xmath15,the dws generate no contrast and are invisible .",
    "( * b * ) for a tilted sample , @xmath6 , with the tilt direction indicated by the white arrows , the dws appear .",
    "that the same area has been imaged is confirmed by the pattern of dark spots , which correspond to defects or dust particles .",
    "( * c * ) contrast linetraces : the experimental contrast was obtained at the position of the white line in ( b ) .",
    "the calculated bloch and nel wall contrast was extracted from figure   [ fresnel_contrast](c ) .",
    "[ imaging],width=302 ]    to enable observation of the dws , fresnel - mode l - tem imaging was carried out , which reveals dws as lines of black / white contrast@xcite . for materials with in - plane magnetization this is achieved by defocussing the imaging lens ; the induction either side of the dw results in a lorentz deflection and the electron beam diverges or converges at the wall giving dark or bright wall contrast .",
    "however , for perpendicularly magnetized films , no deflection arises from the out - of - plane component if the electron beam is at normal incidence .",
    "thus any contrast will arise from the in - plane component , which only exists at the position of the dw .",
    "for the case of bloch and nel dws , the calculated fresnel images are shown in figure  [ fresnel_contrast](b ) for normal incidence .",
    "the bloch wall on the left shows black / white contrast as each edge of the dw is similar a diverging or converging wall , but with no induction on one side of the wall , as has been observed experimentally @xcite . in the case of nel walls at normal incidence",
    "no contrast is visible , as shown in the right hand image of figure  [ fresnel_contrast](b ) calculated from the magnetization configuration .",
    "the reason for this is that the wall rotation is completely divergent in nature and gives no contrast in lorentz microscopy .",
    "the basis of contrast in lorentz microscopy is that the magnetization configuration must have a component of magnetization curl parallel to the electron beam direction @xcite ; there is no such component present in the nel wall .",
    "this distinguishes the two walls , although the nel walls are invisible in this orientation .",
    "the nel wall can be made visible by tilting the film along an axis perpendicular to the wall in the plane of the film so that the electron beam no longer passes through the film at normal incidence .",
    "this then results in a component of magnetization / induction in the domains that is perpendicular to the beam and gives only black or only white contrast at the walls , as shown in figure  [ fresnel_contrast](c ) on the right hand side . tilting of a film with a bloch wall results in contrast observed in figure  [ fresnel_contrast](c ) on the left , which retains its black / white character although now in an asymmetric form . in this way",
    "the wall positions are identified and their forms distinguished . in summary , bloch walls will be visible when the film is untilted and show asymmetric black / white contrast when tilted , whilst nel walls will be invisible when untilted but show symmetric black or white contrast when tilted .",
    "the walls under investigation here in sputtered pt / co / alo@xmath0 trilayers were imaged in the fresnel mode , and the results are shown in figure  [ imaging ] .",
    "first , the film was subjected to an out - of - plane applied field of @xmath16  mt using the objective lens , close to value of the coercivity , to induce dws .",
    "after the applied field had been removed , fresnel images were taken both untilted and tilted by 30 degrees , which are shown in figure  [ imaging](a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "it is apparent that no dws at all are visible when the film is untilted , furthermore when tilted the dw contrast appears either dark or bright without any dark / bright asymmetry .",
    "an intensity linetrace across bright and dark walls is shown in figure  [ imaging](c ) confirming the symmetric nature of the contrast .",
    "( a small intensity variation across the image can be seen in both images which is non magnetic in origin ) .",
    "to illustrate the difference between bloch and nel walls , calculated intensity variations derived from the tilted images in figure  [ fresnel_contrast](c ) are shown in figure  [ imaging](c ) for comparison with the data .",
    "the clear asymmetry expected from the bloch walls is not visible in the experimental linetrace .",
    "we conclude therefore that the walls are of the nel type . it should be noted that the component of the magnetization at the centre of the nel wall gives no contrast in fresnel images in this configuration .",
    "therefore , whilst we can conclude that these are indeed nel walls , it is not possible to say anything about the chirality from such images alone .",
    "we now turn our attention to the domain wall behaviour in the presence of an applied field to determine whether chiral effects are induced by the asymmetric interfaces of the co layer .",
    "the nature of the dw chiral handedness was studied in the tem by varying the objective lens field ( which is vertical ) to bring the dws together and observing the subsequent interaction between them .",
    "figure  [ dw_squashing](a)-(c ) shows a sequence of images of dws displaced by a magnetic field .",
    "the initial magnetic state shown in figure  [ dw_squashing](a ) is imaged before the magnetic field is applied .",
    "figure  [ dw_squashing](b ) and ( c ) show the magnetic state during and after the application of a magnetic field @xmath17  mt . figure  [ dw_squashing](d ) was acquired under the same conditions as figure  [ dw_squashing](c ) , but for a different in - plane tilt direction as depicted schematically in figure  [ dw_squashing](i ) , confirming the nel state .",
    "it can be seen that the up - domain state grows and the down - domain shrinks until the point where the two dws meet , at which point they merge into 360@xmath18 dws .",
    "a much larger magnetic field has to be applied in order to annihilate these and fully saturate the film .",
    "the formation of 360@xmath18 dws takes place when two dws of the same chirality meet and are unable to annihilate for topological reasons @xcite .",
    "since both dws have the same chirality , the magnetostatic charge created on either side of the wall prevents the two walls , which are locked and protected by the dmi , from annihilation .",
    "this situation is sketched in figure  [ dw_mumax](a)-(b ) .",
    "it is important to note that _ all _ of the dw pairs we observed formed 360@xmath18 dws when they met , showing that these nel walls are homochiral , a situation that is enforced by the presence of an interfacial dmi .",
    "nel dws with the same chirality , showing the magnetostatic charges .",
    "( * b * ) a composite 360@xmath18 nel dw after application of a small out - of - plane magnetic field that drives them together .",
    "the magnetostatic charge prevents the two dws from annihilation .",
    "( * c * ) dw annihilation field as a function of @xmath19 as calculated by micromagnetic simulations for different uniaxial anisotropies .",
    "the inset illustrates the simulated profile of the up - down - up domain including two nel walls squeezed together by an external field .",
    "[ dw_mumax],width=302 ]    to overcome this topological protection @xcite , a sufficiently strong magnetic field must be applied to overcome the energy barrier and annihilate the @xmath20 dw .",
    "measuring the field required to do this has been suggested as a means of experimentally determining the strength of the dmi @xcite . to collect a statistically significant number of annihilation events",
    ", we have mimicked the same experiment with kerr microscopy measurements in which the up and down domains are easily visible as dark or bright contrast .",
    "domain expansion upon the application of a magnetic field is shown in the kerr micrographs figure  [ dw_squashing](e)-(g ) , exhibiting the same behaviour that was observed by the l - tem .",
    "the white lines appearing in figure  [ dw_squashing](g ) correspond to the two nel walls squeezed together into a @xmath20 structure .",
    "since the magnetic field is not large enough to annihilate them , it is possible to pull them apart again by applying a small magnetic field of the opposite polarity as depicted in figure  [ dw_squashing](h ) .",
    "the coercive field @xmath21  mt can be extracted from the kerr effect hysteresis loop shown inset in figure  [ dw_squashing](j ) , measured with the magnetic field swept in the range @xmath22  mt .    in order to measure the annihilation field , the following magnetic field sequence , illustrated by the blue curve in the inset of figure  [ dw_squashing](j ) , was performed .",
    "the film was first saturated at @xmath23  mt and then the magnetic field was ramped to a maximum field @xmath24 above the coercive field .",
    "the magnetic field is then swept back to @xmath23  mt and so the switching field @xmath25 can be measured .",
    "it is clear from the figure  [ dw_squashing](j ) inset that the film now switches at a field that is lower than the coercive field of the major loop , i.e. @xmath26 .    figure  [ dw_squashing](j ) shows the dependence of the switching field @xmath25 on the maximum field @xmath24 .",
    "the switching field rises linearly until it is as large as @xmath27 , which occurs at @xmath28  mt . for @xmath24 larger than this , @xmath29 .",
    "the linear rise is caused by a greater proportion of annihilated @xmath20 walls , which leads to a lower number of pre - nucleated regions for subsequent reverse domain growth on the reverse portion of the field sweep and a higher switching field .",
    "once all the dws are annihilated at @xmath30  mt , the reversal process is governed by reversed domain nucleation and propagation  just as on the major loop  rather than propagation alone .",
    "since the stability of the two nel walls in the 360@xmath18 structure depends on the magnitude of the dmi , the annihilation field is a direct evaluation of the magnitude of the dmi@xcite .",
    "micromagnetic simulations were performed to evaluate the effect of the dmi on the dw annihilation field . in this model we used the following material parameters appropriate to co : saturation magnetization @xmath31  a / m , exchange stiffness @xmath32  pj / m , and perpendicular uniaxial anisotropy @xmath33  j / m@xmath34 . to investigate this problem we first prepared two dws in a simulated nanowire of lateral dimensions @xmath35  nm@xmath36  nm by introducing an up - down - up domain . the two dws were set to be 300  nm apart and then brought together by an external field as shown in the inset of figure  [ dw_mumax](c ) .",
    "figure  [ dw_mumax](c ) shows the calculated dependence of the annihilation field on @xmath19 for different anisotropies to include the error of the anisotropy measurement .",
    "we find that our measured value of @xmath37 implies that @xmath38  mj / m@xmath39 .",
    "since the micromagnetic simulations were performed at @xmath40  k , and there is a possibility of dw annihilation due to thermal activation , this value is only a lower limit of @xmath19 .",
    "the real @xmath19 could be much be higher , potentially reaching similar value @xmath41  mj / m@xmath39 as measured by pizzini @xmath42 @xcite . in any case , the most pessimistic value of @xmath38  mj / m@xmath39 is already high enough satisfy the condition @xmath43 needed to enforce the nel configuration for the dws in this system @xcite .",
    "our l - tem experiments show that dws in the pt / co / alo@xmath0 system are indeed of the nel form , enforced by an interfacial dmi overcoming the preference of the magnetostatic energy term for bloch walls .",
    "the fact that they always form @xmath20 structures when pressed together by a field shows that these walls are homochiral , just as is expected in the presence of a dmi .",
    "we have implemented the method of annihilating these @xmath20 structures with a field in order to estimate the strength of the dmi in this system as being at least @xmath38  mj / m@xmath39 .",
    "this confirms the widespread assumption , made to interpret field- or current - driven domain wall motion data , that such walls are of the nel type due to an effective field arising from the interfacial dmi .",
    "knowledge of wall structures is not only important in dw dynamics experiments and the design of spintronic technologies based on this phenomenon , such as racetrack memories , where the fact that the dws are topologically protected from mutual annihilation means that they can be very closely packed , permitting data density .",
    "also , these nel type walls , wrapped in a circle , form the boundaries of bubble domains with non - zero skyrmion winding numbers , leading to inertial dynamics @xcite and with potential for use in skyrmion - based spintronic devices @xcite .",

    "<S> the presence of a rashba electric field@xcite and dzyaloshinskii - moryia interaction@xcite ( dmi ) have been recently demonstrated in such systems . </S>",
