    "spiral arms are the most prominent structures in disk galaxies , playing a vital role in their secular evolution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "they possess secondary structures such as young stellar complexes and regions distributed in a",
    " beads on a string \" fashion along them ( e.g. , @xcite ) as well as giant molecular clouds in which new star formation takes place ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "another secondary feature includes gaseous feathers , referring to filamentary structures that protrude almost perpendicularly from the arms and are swept into a trailing configuration in the interarm regions , seen in optical or infrared images of nearby spiral galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these are in close geometrical association with narrow dust lanes that represent shocked interstellar gas due to its gravitational interaction with the stellar spiral arms .",
    "this strongly suggests that the shock compression of gas in galaxy rotation may trigger formation of the secondary structures and ensuing star formation in galactic disks .",
    "one of the unsolved problems regarding galactic spiral shocks is what mechanism is responsible for the secondary structure formation after the shock compression .",
    "there have been a number of studies on this issue ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but they differ in the relative importance of gas self - gravity , magnetic fields , and other hydrodynamic processes .",
    "for example , @xcite used a lagrangian linear stability analysis of postshock flows and showed that self - gravity allows hydrodynamic disturbances to grow transiently via swing amplifier .",
    "@xcite found that an inclusion of azimuthal magnetic fields gets rid of a stabilizing effect of epicycle motions , making self - gravity more powerful in gathering the gas .",
    "@xcite ran direct numerical simulations using local shearing - box models and found that magnetized disturbances indeed grow much faster than the case of pure swing amplification , rapidly forming perpendicular structures that resemble observed feathers .",
    "they further showed that these feather - like structures experience fragmentation at the nonlinear stage and form gravitationally bound clouds .",
    "these results based on local models were shown valid also in global simulations of @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite performed an eulerian linear stability analysis of the shearing - box models considered by @xcite , and found that feathers represent parasitic instabilities intrinsic to a self - gravitating , magnetized spiral shock .",
    "interestingly , these feather - forming instabilities are referred to differently as azimuthal instability , magneto - jeans instability , and feathering instability in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , respectively .    on the other hand , numerical studies of @xcite ,",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have shown that self - gravity is not prerequisite to the formation of secondary structures .",
    "in particular , @xcite ran global , non - self - gravitating simulations of galactic disks with no magnetic field , and found that spiral shocks are unstable to wiggling perturbations and form dense clumps in the shock - compressed layer , provided that the shocks are strong .",
    "they termed this clump - forming hydrodynamic instability the wiggle instability ( wi ) , and suggested it as a feather formation mechanism .",
    "@xcite also observed formation of clumps along the arms and feathers projecting into the interarm regions in their smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations , which they attributed to orbit crowding of particles with non - uniform density that change their angular momenta in the shock . in the models of @xcite , it is necessary for the gas to be cold to grow into interarm features . in a more recent high - resolution numerical study with self - gravity and star - formation feedback",
    "included , @xcite found that spiral shocks produce regularly - spaced , star - forming clumps due to a strong velocity gradient near the arms .",
    "the wi of large - scale galactic shocks appears ubiquitous in hydrodynamic simulations of disk galaxies with non - axisymmetric patterns as long as resolution is large enough to resolve it .",
    "for instance , recent grid - based simulations of @xcite for radial mass drift by spiral shocks found a strong development of the wi at the shock fronts that grows faster at smaller radii except near the corotation resonance .",
    "this suggests that the wi directly involves shock fronts and grows within an orbital time scale ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to spiral shocks , dust - lane shocks surrounding a nuclear ring in barred galaxies are found to suffer from wi to form dense clumps along them ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the wi seems to be suppressed by magnetic fields pervasive in the interstellar medium @xcite and by shock flapping motions that naturally occur in a vertically stratified disk @xcite .    despite these numerical efforts ,",
    "however , the physical nature of the wi has remained elusive so far .",
    "based on a richardson - number criterion , @xcite proposed that the wi originates in kelvin - helmholtz instabilities ( khi ) occurring in a shear layer behind the shock . @xcite also noted that the morphologies of clumps formed in their simulations are similar to the patterns in the khi .",
    "however , the numerical simulations mentioned above show that the instability grows from the shock front distortion itself , and an isolated shock front has been known unconditionally stable to distortional perturbations ( see below ) .",
    "in addition , as @xcite noted , the richardson - number criterion is only a _ necessary _",
    "condition for _ stability _",
    "@xcite , so that one should be cautious when applying it as an instability criterion .",
    "moreover , @xcite showed that the postshock flow of a spiral shock is linearly stable to the khi .",
    "@xcite also argued that shear in the postshock flow can be removed by choosing a frame moving at the tangential velocity at the shock front , implying that the postshock layer is stable to the khi .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite found that the wi of dust - lane shocks in barred galaxies is deeply related to the growth of potential vorticity ( pv ) from curved spiral shocks . in a quite different perspective , @xcite raised a possibility that the wi may be due entirely to numerical artifacts arising from the inability to resolve a shock inclined to numerical grids .    in this paper",
    ", we perform a linear stability analysis of galactic spiral shocks , aiming to clarify the physical nature of the wi .",
    "we adopt a local shearing - box model of an infinitesimally - thin galactic gaseous disk , and assume that the gas is isothermal , unmagnetized , and non - self - gravitating .",
    "this simple disk model is of course unrealistic in the sense that it can not handle important physics related to the multi - phase , turbulent interstellar medium ( e.g. , @xcite ) , star formation , feedback , etc . , and is unable to capture the curvature effect of large - scale shocks .",
    "nevertheless , it incorporates all necessary ingredients to explore spiral shocks ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and allows to study wi at a fixed angular frequency of galaxy rotation .",
    "technically , we follow the eulerian linear stability analysis presented by @xcite , but neglect the effects of magnetic fields and self - gravity in the present work .    stability of an isolated , planar , two - dimensional shock front in an inviscid medium has been studied intensively in the fluid dynamics community ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also @xcite ) . here",
    ", the term  isolated \" indicates a situation where a shock is located far away from its driving source and the upstream supersonic flow is completely unperturbed .",
    "the general result is that sinusoidal wiggling perturbations to an otherwise planar shock decay asymptotically with time as an inverse power law , and such shocks are unconditionally stable if the gas follows an isothermal or an ideal - gas equation of state ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that the wi of an isothermal spiral shock , if it is physical , must involve perturbations in the preshock regions .",
    "we shall show below that it makes use of pv generated from a perturbed shock front .",
    "spiral shocks can not be treated isolated since gas in galaxies crosses them multiple times in the course of galaxy rotation .",
    "if perturbations remain coherent before and after the shock fronts , pv can grow continuously through successive passages of spiral shocks , leading to the wi .",
    "in addition to galactic disks , the pv generation by curved shocks also actively engages in the dynamics of protoplanetary disks .",
    "the pv accumulation by repeated passages of shocks produced by an embedded planet is known to give rise to a secondary instability near the corotation resonance , changing the gravitational torque on and thus the migration time scale of the planet ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ s :",
    "beqn ] , we describe the basic equations we solve and specify the parameters we adopt . in section [ s : back ] , we obtain the steady equilibrium solutions of spiral shocks that we use as a background state of the wi . in section [",
    "s : method ] , we present the formulation of our normal - mode stability analysis , the shock jump conditions , and the spatial behavior of pv that perturbations should obey , and the computation method to find eigenvalues . the resulting dispersion relations for one- and two - dimensional modes together with physical interpretation in terms of pv are presented in section [ s : disp ] . in section [ s : num ] , we run direct numerical simulations of the wi , and compare the results with those of the linear stability analysis . in section [ s : sum ] , we conclude with a summary and discussion of our results in comparison with the previous studies .",
    "we consider an infinitesimally - thin , non - self - gravitating galactic gaseous disk with no magnetic field , and study its responses to an imposed stellar spiral - arm potential .",
    "the disk is rotating at angular frequency @xmath0 at the galactocentric radius @xmath1 .",
    "we assume that the gas is isothermal with a sound speed of @xmath2 .",
    "the arms rotate rigidly about the galaxy center at a fixed pattern speed @xmath3 .    for problems involving spiral arms , it is advantageous to employ a local cartesian frame @xmath4 corotating with the arms lying at @xmath1 , introduced by @xcite . in this frame , the two orthogonal @xmath5- and @xmath6-axes correspond to the directions perpendicular and parallel to the local spiral arm , respectively ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we make a local approximation ( @xmath7 ) and assume that the arms are tightly wound with a pitch angle @xmath8 . in the absence of the spiral - arm potential , the gas has the uniform surface density @xmath9 and the velocity @xmath10 , where @xmath11 arising from galaxy rotation . here , @xmath12 measures local shear rate and is equal to unity for flat rotation .",
    "the basic equations of ideal hydrodynamics expanded in this local frame read @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the gas surface density , @xmath16 is the velocity induced by the arms , @xmath17 is the total velocity in the local frame , and @xmath18 is the stellar spiral - arm potential ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    for an @xmath19-armed spiral ,",
    "the arm - to - arm distance along the @xmath5-direction is @xmath20 . to be consistent with the local approximation , gas flows should be periodic in the @xmath5-direction , with period @xmath21 in length .",
    "for the external spiral potential , therefore , we take a simple form @xmath22 with amplitude @xmath23 , which is a local analog of a logarithmic potential considered by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we confine to the domain with @xmath24 , so that the potential minimum occurs at the center of the domain ( i.e. , @xmath25 ) .",
    "we parameterize @xmath26 using a dimensionless parameter @xmath27 which measures the maximum force due to the spiral arm relative to the centrifugal force of galaxy rotation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in two - dimensional gas flows ,",
    "conservation of both angular momentum and mass leads to conservation of pv defined by @xmath28 using equations ( [ e : con ] ) and ( [ e : mom ] ) , one can directly show that @xmath29 indicating that @xmath30 remains unchanged along a given streamline ( e.g. , @xcite ) , provided that it does not intersect curved discontinuities such as shocks or contact discontinuities .",
    "we will show in section [ s : disp ] that a deformed shock front can serve as a source of pv , which in turn renders the shock prone to the wi .",
    "equations ( [ e : con])([e : f ] ) are completely specified by six dimensionless parameters : @xmath31 , @xmath19 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 . for our numerical examples presented below , we take @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40@xmath41 , and @xmath42 , which represents conditions in normal disk galaxies fairly well .",
    "we remark a few limitations of our local models .",
    "first , they neglect terms arising from curvature effects in the coordinates that may be important for forming large - scale shocks associated with arms with a large pitch angle .",
    "second , the local approximation with @xmath43 tends to make @xmath34 smaller than realistic values in disk galaxies with not - so - tightly - wound arms ( see eq . )",
    "when @xmath38 produces equilibrium spiral shocks that are equivalent to @xmath44 when @xmath45 ( or @xmath46 , corresponding to the arms of m51 ) . ] .",
    "third , limited to the galactic midplane , our two - dimensional models are unable to capture non - planar dynamics , such as shock flapping motions @xcite , involving the vertical dimension .",
    "nevertheless , our models under the shearing box approximation naturally incorporate large scale shear , and can thus well describe periodic gas flows as well as epicycle motions , which are the essential ingredients of galactic spiral shocks .",
    "our local models are in fact ideal to identify the physical mechanism behind the wi qualitatively , as we will present in section [ s : disp ] .",
    "as a first step , we seek for steady - state solutions , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , of equations ( [ e : con ] ) and ( [ e : mom ] ) . here and hereafter , we use the subscript `` 0 '' to indicate the time - independent shock solutions .",
    "such solutions were obtained by previous studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we revisit this issue here in order to obtain a background state of the wi .",
    "the steady solutions of spiral shocks satisfy @xmath50 @xmath51 and @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the square of the epicycle frequency .",
    "equations ( [ e : con0 ] ) and ( [ e : momx0 ] ) are combined to give @xmath54 equations ( [ e : momy0 ] ) and ( [ e : momx01 ] ) can be solved numerically over @xmath24 subject to the periodic boundary conditions at @xmath55 and @xmath21 .    since @xmath56 it follows that @xmath57 showing that the pv of the steady spiral shocks is constant everywhere .",
    "@xcite showed that even a very weak spiral forcing ( @xmath58 for their model parameters ) results in shocks in the gas flow . in order to meet the periodic boundary conditions",
    ", spiral shocks should involve a sonic point where @xmath59 , through which a subsonic gas accelerates to supersonic speeds .",
    "let @xmath60 denote the location of the sonic point .",
    "the right - hand side of equation ( [ e : momx01 ] ) should vanish at @xmath61 for a transonic solution to exist .",
    "let us expand @xmath62 and @xmath63 around the sonic point as    [ e : so0 ] @xmath64    where @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and the coefficients @xmath67 and @xmath68 are to be determined . here , we keep up to second - order terms in the series expansion of the velocities since they are needed in the expansion of the perturbation variables in section [ s : sonic1 ] .    plugging equation ( [ e : so0 ] ) into equations ( [ e : momy0 ] ) and ( [ e : momx01 ] ) , we find that @xmath69 @xmath70^{1/2},\\ ] ] @xmath71 @xmath72 and @xmath73 note that we take a positive sign for @xmath74 in equation ( [ e : alp1 ] ) since @xmath62 should increase across the sonic point for a transonic solution .",
    "in addition to the periodic boundary conditions at @xmath75 and @xmath76 , the spiral - shock solutions should satisfy the following jump conditions at the shock front , @xmath77 :    [ e : sj ] @xmath78    where @xmath79 , with the superscripts `` @xmath80 '' and `` @xmath81 '' indicating the quantities evaluated at the immediate behind ( @xmath82 ) and ahead ( @xmath83 ) of the shock front , respectively .",
    "equation ( [ e : s1 ] ) is automatically satisfied from equation ( [ e : con0 ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ e : s2 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath84 a jump condition for the perpendicular velocity in an isothermal shock , while equation ( [ e : s3 ] ) states that the parallel component of the velocity should be continuous across the shock .",

    "the dotted line in figure [ f:1d](b ) indicates the sound speed @xmath2 .",

    "the gas should be accelerated downstream and pass through the sonic point , increasing @xmath62 .",
    "the constraint of the potential vorticity conservation requires the velocity parallel to the shock to increase as @xmath89 after the shock , making shear reversed wherever @xmath90 @xcite . since @xmath91 for",
    "our adopted set of parameters , the sonic point lies just outside the region of shear reversal .    to further understand the behaviors of the steady solutions near the sonic point , it is useful to consider the problem in analogy with a flow through the de laval nozzle of a jet engine , for which any smooth sonic transition occurs only when the cross - sectional area @xmath92 achieves a local minimum at the sonic point ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . by comparing equation ( 6.28 ) of @xcite with equation ( [ e : momx01 ] ) , one can see that two processes ( epicycle shaking and gravitational focusing of the arm ) shape @xmath92 for galactic gas flows . the two conditions ( @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) for the minimum cross - sectional area at the sonic point give @xmath95 in equation ( [ e : bet0 ] ) and require the positivity of the terms inside the square brackets in equation ( [ e : alp1 ] ) . obviously , the gravitational focusing term increases ( or decreases ) @xmath96 with @xmath5 where @xmath97 ( or where @xmath98 ) , which in turn requires the coriolis term should decrease ( or increase ) @xmath96 .",
    "thus , @xmath99 when @xmath100 , which happens when the spiral forcing is weak with @xmath101 , while @xmath102 when @xmath98 , as figure [ f:1d ] shows . in the former ( latter ) case ,",
    "the effect of the gravitating focusing relative the coriolis term becomes smaller ( larger ) as @xmath34 increases , which tends to shift the sonic point toward the downstream side .",

    "since pv is preserved along a streamline in between shocks , the fact that the wi relies on the entropy - vortex mode requires that vorticity should be generated at the shock discontinuities . in appendix",
    "[ a : vor ] , we utilize the shock jump conditions ( [ e : j123 ] ) to derive an expression for the pv changes at the shock . in the wkb limit ,",

    "on the other hand , @xmath304 is due to the discontinuity of @xmath305 across the shock ( eq . ) .",
    "the role of the @xmath306 terms in equation ( [ e : pvj3 ] ) in producing or reducing pv differs from each other . the first @xmath302 term tends to decrease pv at the shock due to shock compression of the perpendicular velocity . to see this more clearly , for instance ,",

    "the vertical dotted line and thick sinusoidal curve indicate the unperturbed and perturbed shock fronts , respectively .",
    "since @xmath315 ( or @xmath316 ) from the linear dispersion relation , the deformed shock front moves faster along the @xmath6-direction than the background flow at the shock .",
    "viewed in the stationary shock frame , therefore , the background gas is moving in the negative @xmath6-direction , as represented by the black arrows on the left . in traversing the shock ,",
    "the velocity vectors bend toward the local tangent to an instantaneous shock front , which are indicated by the red arrows .",
    "this naturally produces nonvanishing pv ( marked by dashed curved with arrows ) in the postshock flow .",
    "the sign of the pv depends on the shape of the shock front , such that it is positive ( negative ) in the regions where the shock is convex ( concave ) seen from the upstream direction .",
    "that is , @xmath121 and @xmath151 have opposite signs , consistent with equation ( [ e : pvj5 ] ) .",
    "when the @xmath303 terms dominates the other terms , pv contained in the entropy - vortex waves can grow whenever the waves pass through distorted spiral shocks in the course of galaxy rotation .",
    "interactions of traveling waves in the @xmath5-direction form a standing entropy - vortex mode that can grow exponentially in time , leading to the wi .",

    "_ on the other hand , either when @xmath166 dominates the perturbations , a most likely situation where acoustic modes are stronger than entropy - vortex modes , or when @xmath167 dominates ( without involving strong shock deformations ) , pv drops at the shocks and the associated entropy - vortex mode becomes weaker with time .",
    "this pv reduction is responsible for the decaying modes shown in figures [ f : disp_all ] and [ f : efun2d ] .",
    "since @xmath317 , the @xmath304 term becomes predominant for very large @xmath118 , eventually stabilizing the wi at @xmath318 for the dispersion relation displayed in figure [ f : disp7](a ) .",

    "since the two methods are complementary to one another , they should yield the same results .",
    "however , @xcite reported that non - self - gravitating and unmagnetized shocks are linearly stable due possibly to the non - vanishing radial velocity , which is seemingly in contrast to our results .",
    "we note that their conclusion was based on long - wavelength perturbations with @xmath356 , about two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath357 found in the present work , which were evolved only up to @xmath358 .",
    "figure [ f : disp_all ] shows that modes with @xmath359 can also be unstable , although their growth rates are less than @xmath360 .",
    "since the corresponding amplification factor over one orbital period is less than 10% , they were unlikely to grow to appreciable amplitudes in the work of @xcite .",
    "in addition , such slowly growing modes could easily be suppressed by numerical viscosity present in any numerical scheme ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while we have shown that the wi grows very rapidly in a razor - thin disk with no magnetic field , it still remains to be seen whether it is responsible for dense arm clouds and feathers in real spiral galaxies for the following two reasons .",
    "first , it is unclear whether the wi would operate in disks that are magnetized and vertically stratified .",
    "@xcite showed that spiral shocks exhibit flapping motions in the direction perpendicular to the arm , when the vertical degree of freedom is considered .",
    "these motions are caused by incommensurability between the arm - to - arm crossing time with the vertical oscillation periods , capable of injecting turbulent energy into dense post - shock gas @xcite .",
    "these non - steady motions as well as strong vertical shear present in three - dimensional shocks appear to disrupt coherence of vortical structures at different heights , preventing the growth of wi @xcite .",
    "in addition , the presence of magnetic fields appears to stabilize wi @xcite and completely quenches it when the fields are of equipartition strength or stronger @xcite , although it is uncertain whether the magnetic stabilization is due to magnetic forces on the perturbations or through a reduced background shock strength .",
    "second , even if the wi does develop in real disk galaxies , the connection between the wi and observed giant clouds and interarm feathers is not direct .",
    "the wi itself involves perturbations only near the shock front , resulting in very weak perturbations in the interarm regions .",
    "it also occurs at very small spatial scales , corresponding to 0.07 times the arm - to - arm spacing when @xmath237 and even smaller scales when the arms are stronger . on the other hand , observed feathers and giant clouds in the arms of m51 have a mean separation of order @xmath361 kpc ( e.g. , @xcite ) , consistent with the jeans length at the arm density peak ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and appear quite strong also in the interarm regions .",
    "recently , @xcite carried out a linear stability analysis of feathering instability by including self - gravity and magnetic fields .",
    "they showed that feathering modes retain relatively strong presence in the interarm regions and grow sufficiently rapidly , indicating that self - gravity may be essential for the formation of interarm feathers .",
    "all of these suggest that the wi _ alone _",
    "is unlikely responsible for interarm feathers .",
    "of course , it can not be ruled out the possibility that small clumps produced primarily by the wi become denser by self - gravity , radiative cooling , and/or through mutual mergers , as in high - density clumps produced in models of @xcite , possibly developing into feathers in the downstream side .",
    "it would thus be interesting to explore the effects of self - gravity and magnetic fields on the wi , and their relationships with nonaxisymmetric interarm features .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge constructive comments from the referee , as well as helpful discussions with b.  g.  elmegreen and e.  c.  ostriker .",

    "galactic gas flows periodically meet spiral shocks , once in every @xmath362 interval .",
    "while pv is conserved along a given streamline in between shocks , it inevitably experiences a sudden jump when moving across a distorted shock . in this appendix",
    ", we derive the jump condition for the perturbed pv , @xmath363 , at the shock front ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "we first want to express @xmath364 , @xmath365 , and @xmath366 in terms of @xmath367 , @xmath368 , @xmath369 , and @xmath147 .",
    "it is useful to write @xmath370 from equations ( [ e : bd1 ] ) and ( [ e : mu ] ) .",
    "it then follows that @xmath371 from equation ( [ e : momx01 ] ) .    with the help of equations ( [ e : aux2 ] ) and ( [ e : app1 ] ) , we solve equations ( [ e : j1 ] ) and ( [ e : j2 ] ) for @xmath364 and @xmath365 to obtain @xmath372 @xmath373 for @xmath374 . , equations ( [ e : j1 ] ) and ( [ e : j2 ] ) yield of course a trivial solution @xmath375 . ] here , @xmath376 .",
    "equation ( [ e : j3 ] ) simply results in @xmath377 these are the jump conditions that the perturbation variables should satisfy at the shock front .    substituting equation ( [ e : dv1 ] ) in equation ( [ e : pv1 ] ) and arranging the terms using equations ( [ e : pjs])([e : pjv ] ) , we obtain the perturbed pv immediate behind of the shock @xmath378 while the perturbed pv ahead of the shock is given by @xmath379 where @xmath380 .",
    "subtraction of equation ( [ e : pva ] ) from equation ( [ e : pvb ] ) gives the jump condition for the pv across the perturbed shock @xmath381 which can be rewritten in a more illuminating form as @xmath382 with @xmath383 being the perturbed preshock velocity perpendicular to the instantaneous shock front ( see eq .  [ [ e : tpp ] ] ) .",
    "the second term in the right - hand side of equation ( [ e : pvj2 ] ) follows from equations ( [ e : pv1 ] ) and ( [ e : kjump ] ) , resulting originally from non - uniform background shear across a shock front .",
    "equation ( [ e : pvj2 ] ) states that the pv jump at the shock is due to two factors : the tangential variation of the perpendicular velocity and the discontinuous change of @xmath144 at the shock .",
    "the origin of the first term in equation ( [ e : pvj2 ] ) is crocco s theorem for vorticity generation from a curved shock front .",
    "@xcite showed that the vorticity jump across an unsteady shock amounts to @xmath384 where @xmath385 is the curvature of the shock front , @xmath386 is the tangential component of the fluid velocity , @xmath387 is the shock speed relative to the normal component of the preshock fluid velocity , and @xmath388 denotes the coordinate tangential to the shock ( see also @xcite ) . noting that spiral shocks in our local models are straight @xmath389",
    ", one can see that @xmath390 with @xmath391 and @xmath392 in the absence of background shear ( @xmath393 ) .",
