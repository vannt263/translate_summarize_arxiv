    "hot subdwarf b stars ( sdbs ) are evolved core helium - burning stars with very thin hydrogen envelopes residing at the extreme end of the blue horizontal branch @xcite .",
    "the formation of these stars remains unclear .",
    "normal horizontal branch stars are formed after core helium - burning is ignited in the red - giant phase . since the hydrogen envelopes of sdbs are extraordinarily thin , large mass - loss is necessary right at the tip of the red - giant branch . in the case of the close binaries among the hot subdwarfs  about half of the known sdb stars are members of short - period ( p @xmath1 10 days ) systems @xcite  the required mass loss is triggered by the formation of a common envelope , which is finally ejected .",
    "the formation of sdbs with main sequence companions in wide orbits on the other hand can be explained by stable roche lobe overflow @xcite .",
    "the formation of single sdbs is less well understood .",
    "several single star scenarios are currently under discussion ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) , but all these scenarios require either a fine - tuning of parameters or extreme environmental conditions which are unlikely to be met for the bulk of the observed subdwarfs in the field . a particularly interesting scenario has been suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "accordingly , single sdb stars could be formed if a substellar companion in close orbit was engulfed by the red - giant progenitor and provided sufficient angular momentum to the common envelope before it was destroyed .",
    "alternative scenarios invoke stellar mergers to form single sdb stars .",
    "the merger of binary white dwarfs was investigated by @xcite as well as @xcite who showed that an ehb star can form when two helium core white dwarfs merge and the product is sufficiently massive to ignite helium .",
    "@xcite proposed the merger of a red giant and a low mass main - sequence star during the common envelope phase .",
    "however , the merger channel was under debate , because all single sdbs analysed so far turned out to be slow rotators @xcite in contrast to the expectations . here",
    "we report the discovery of the fast rotating , single sdb ec22018@xmath01916 .",

    "a very important predicition made by @xcite is that sdbs formed via the ce - merger channel should be rare .",
    "ec22018@xmath01916 is unique among @xmath71 slowly rotating sdb stars analysed so far @xcite .",
    "in contrast to that , @xcite predict a large fraction if not all of the single sdbs to be formed by wd - mergers . unless there is a mechanism to get rid off all the angular momentum involved in a merger as suggested by @xcite ,",
    "this observation is hard to explain .",
    "furthermore , @xcite predict that a large fraction of the sdbs formed after ce - merger should rotate with a critical velocity @xmath72 , which is defined as the rotational velocity at which mass loss induced by centrifugal forces prevents the red - giant core to accrete more material from the secondary .",
    "@xcite estimate this critical velocity to be about one third of the breakup velocity @xmath73 . using the parameters derived for ec22018@xmath01916 ,",
    "we calculate @xmath74 perfectly consistent with the projected rotational velocity measured from the spectrum .    in conclusion ,",

    "<S> hot subdwarf b stars ( sdbs ) are evolved core helium - burning stars with very thin hydrogen envelopes . in order to form an sdb </S>",
    "<S> , the progenitor has to lose almost all of its hydrogen envelope right at the tip of the red giant branch . in binary systems , </S>",
    "<S> mass transfer to the companion provides the extraordinary mass loss required for their formation . </S>",
    "<S> however , apparently single sdbs exist as well and their formation is unclear since decades . the merger of helium white dwarfs leading to an ignition of core helium - burning or the merger of a helium core and a low mass star during the common envelope phase have been proposed . </S>",
    "<S> here we report the discovery of ec22081@xmath01916 as a fast rotating , single sdb star of low gravity . </S>",
    "<S> its atmospheric parameters indicate , that the hydrogen envelope must be unusually thick , which is at variance with the he - wd merger scenario , but consistent with a common envelope merger of a low - mass , possibly substellar object with a red - giant core . </S>"
