    "star has previously reported precision measurements  @xcite of the analyzing power ( @xmath3 ) of inclusive neutral pions in the forward region .",
    "these measurements used data taken in rhic runs 3 , 5 , and 6 with the forward pion detector ( fpd ) , a modular pb - glass array that can be moved horizontally in the plane transverse to the beamline .",
    "these data were taken at @xmath0 gev , where inclusive @xmath4 cross sections are consistent with expectations from pqcd  @xcite .",
    "the measurements showed that the variation of @xmath3 with feynman - x ( @xmath5 ) was qualitatively consistent with expectations from the sivers effect  @xcite , while the @xmath2 dependence was not . the extent",
    "to which the sivers and collins  @xcite effects contribute to these measurements has yet to be determined .",
    "fpd measurements of inclusive @xmath6 production have also been reported , with the data indicating a strong growth of @xmath3 with increasing @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "star has also observed forward analyzing powers with its `` beam - beam - counters '' ( bbc ) , at rapidities from @xmath8 .",
    "single transverse spin asymmetries in the detection of charged hadrons with these detectors can be used as a `` local polarimeter ''  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : bbc ] shows the bunch - by - bunch relative transverse polarization as seen at star , for one rhic fill in 2008 ( run 8) .",
    "all fills have been examined and provide confirmation that the bunches have relatively uniform absolute polarization , and that the expected bunch - by - bunch spin pattern is also the spin pattern observed at star",
    ". the local polarimeter also allows studies of possible variations in the bunch - by - bunch polarization within a fill .",
    "the sivers effect identifies the origin of the observed spin asymmetries with orbital motion of the quarks inside the polarized proton . by contrast , in the collins effect the polarization of the struck quark is correlated to the polarization of the proton , and the fragmentation of the polarized quark leads to asymmetries within the resulting jet .",
    "star commissioned a new detector in 2008 for run 8 , the forward meson spectrometer ( fms )  @xcite .",
    "the fms is a nearly hermetic array of @xmath9 pb - glass blocks situated @xmath10 cm downstream of the interaction point and spanning an area @xmath11 @xmath12 perpendicular to the beam pipe .",
    "it covers the full azimuth in the range @xmath13 and provides a many - fold increase in the areal coverage of the forward region at star  @xcite .",
    "this larger detector enhances the ability to extend the previously published inclusive @xmath4 data  @xcite , and also allows the measurements of higher mass resonances , including the @xmath14  @xcite and @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "l[0.0in]8.0 cm     the inclusive @xmath4 @xmath3 was measured using the fms in run 8 , and the @xmath7 dependence of this data has provided an important confirmation of the previously published data  @xcite . in addition , the fms has extended star s @xmath2 reach in the forward direction . the run 8 data agree with the previous data and also indicate that the analyzing power in the forward region remains large to at least @xmath16 gev .",
    "moreover , the fms has allowed studies of two-@xmath4 events .",
    "studies of the azimuthal difference @xmath17 of all observed @xmath18 pairs in the fms show two peaks , one at @xmath19 and one at @xmath20 , indicating that a hard - scatter event underlies these data .",
    "the collins effect is consistent with string fragmentation models in which a quark / anti - quark pair is produced with relative orbital angular momentum at the point of string breaking  @xcite .",
    "this leads to an asymmetry within a jet in the the production of the spin 0 pions , and would lead to the opposite asymmetry for spin 1 particles  @xcite .",
    "the decay of the spin-1 , @xmath21 mev @xmath14 is accessible with the fms through the @xmath22 decay channel ( br=8.9%  @xcite ) , and observation of a negative @xmath3 might provide strong experimental confirmation of these theoretical models .",
    "the preliminary analysis of @xmath23 decays in the fms for rhic run 8 has been described elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "two photon clusters derive from the @xmath4 decay and one directly from the @xmath14 . for each set of three electromagnetic ( em ) clusters in the fms",
    "there are three possible pairs that can be associated with the @xmath4 decay .",
    "the pair whose mass is closest to @xmath24 gev / c@xmath25 is associated with the @xmath4 decay , while the third is associated with the @xmath26 .",
    "simulations show that this procedure tags the photons correctly upwards of @xmath27 of the time .",
    "minimum energy and @xmath2 cuts are placed on the clusters to help reduce backgrounds from non - photonic particles .",
    "a signal of @xmath28 statistical standard deviations is evident in the data , although with a signal to background ratio of roughly 1:5  @xcite .",
    "this high background level limits the ability to detect a negative analyzing power .",
    "if we assume that the beam polarization is @xmath29 and the background has @xmath30 , then the run 8 data would be able to detect a negative @xmath3 with @xmath31 statistical standard deviations for @xmath32 .",
    "l8.0 cm     pythia(6.2.22)+geant simulations @xcite predict that the largest background source of fake @xmath23 decays are from events where the @xmath26 derives from @xmath4 decay and not from an @xmath14 .",
    "there are also significant contributions from @xmath33 , as well as from events where the cluster that was assumed to be the @xmath26 actually derived from a particle that is not a photon .",
    "the inclusive @xmath4 and @xmath6 data sets show large , positive @xmath3 and also show a strong energy dependence , and the @xmath14 @xmath3 is thus sensitive to the precise composition of the background .",
    "there is evidence that the pythia+ geant simulation significantly underestimates the non - photonic background contribution to the three - em cluster sample . to see this we look at events that have a set of three clusters that pass",
    "the @xmath14 cuts  @xcite , but that also have at least one extra em cluster in the event .",
    "we then consider the cluster that we associated with the @xmath26 for the @xmath23 decay , and we calculate the mass of that cluster with one of the extra clusters .",
    "we refer to this mass as @xmath34 .",
    "we calculate this separately for all extra clusters in the event .",
    "figure  [ fig : m4pi ] shows the distribution of @xmath34 for data and the pythia+geant simulation .",
    "the peak at @xmath24 gev / c@xmath25 is from events where the set of three clusters is actually drawn from the four photons of a @xmath18 event .",
    "the simulation shows significantly fewer events in the tail of the distribution relative to the data , when the simulation is scaled so that the peak height matches the data .",
    "this indicates that the data may contain significantly more non - photonic em clusters than the simulation .",
    "star is also sensitive to the collins asymmetry through jet reconstruction .",
    "spin dependence in the fragmentation of a transversely polarized quark in a transversely polarized proton ( the collins effect ) can be manifested in azimuthal dependence of @xmath35 production within the jet around the jet axis , relative to the direction of the transversely polarized proton spin  @xcite .",
    "the measured asymmetry depends on @xmath36 and @xmath37 where @xmath36 is the azimuth of the pion above the reaction plane , and @xmath37 is the azimuth of the transversely polarized proton spin relative to the reaction plane . here",
    "the reaction plane is spanned by a vector along the transversely polarized beam direction and a vector along the jet axis .",
    "the asymmetry can depend on @xmath38 and also on @xmath39 , the component of the pion momentum transverse to the jet axis .",
    "the asymmetry is calculated separately for @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "since a single spin asymmetry is being measured , one of the rhic beams is averaged over , while the spin state of the other beam is used for @xmath37 . only jets in the forward hemisphere",
    "are considered , where forward is defined relative to the proton beam whose spin state is being considered .",
    "calculations are done separately for averaging over the spin states of each of the two beams .    for this analysis ,",
    "mid - rapidity jets are used .",
    "star s time projection chamber ( tpc )  @xcite provides charged particle tracking with good particle identification for momenta up to @xmath42 gev .",
    "in addition the `` barrel '' ( bemc , @xmath43 )  @xcite and `` endcap '' ( eemc , @xmath44 )  @xcite calorimeters provide em energy measurements and are used for jet reconstruction and also for triggering .",
    "the expected statistical power of transverse data taken in 2006 ( run 6 ) is expected to be better than around @xmath45 . by comparison a simulation based on expectations for transversity and collins fragmentation from global fits to hermes , compass , and belle data  @xcite give a rough expectation for the asymmetry of @xmath46 .",
    "systematic uncertainties currently under study include effects from trigger biases , contamination of the @xmath35 sample from other particles , tracking efficiencies , accuracy of jet and pion kinematic measurements , beam polarization , and relative luminosities for the different beam polarization states .",
    "large single spin asymmetries have been observed at star in the forward region , for both inclusive @xmath4 and @xmath6 signals .",
    "run 8 measurements have extended the @xmath2 range for inclusive @xmath4 at high @xmath7 and also confirmed the previous measurements .",
    "in addition , an observation of a negative analyzing power for @xmath23 in the fms would provide an exciting test of a theoretical understanding of the collins effect .",
    "star is also analyzing mid - rapidity jets to provide measurements of the collins effect .",
    "future upgrades to the forward region might allow jet triggering , which would allow direct measurements of the sivers effect in the forward region .",
    "in addition , star has reported measurements of @xmath15 production in the forward region  @xcite , raising the question of the degree to which drell - yan production of @xmath47 pairs might also be accessible in the future in the mass range above @xmath48 gev / c@xmath25 .",
