    "during supernova explosions , a huge amount of neutrinos are emitted , blowing off surface materials from the proto - neutron star .",
    "the neutrinos interact with nuclei in the supernova ejecta , and the neutrino emission is strong enough to change the compositions , despite the small cross sections for neutrino - nucleus interactions .",
    "the neutrino - induced reactions mainly affect two kinds of proposed nucleosynthetic processes that occur during supernova explosions : one is the synthesis of light elements such as li and b through the @xmath17-process in the he - layer , and the other is the @xmath2-process in the neutrino - driven winds above the surface of the neutron star .",
    "the production of light elements through the @xmath17-process during supernova explosions was first suggested by domogatsky , eramzhyan , & nadyozhin ( 1977 ) .",
    "woosley et al . ( 1990 ) precisely evaluated the roles of the @xmath17-process and showed that a large amount of @xmath0li and @xmath1b is produced during supernova explosions .",
    "woosley & weaver ( 1995 , hereafter ww95 ) tabulated the abundances of the elements , including the light elements with grids of stellar masses and metallicities .",
    "their results have been adopted for studies on galactic chemical evolution ( gce ; e.g. , fields et al .",
    "2000 ; ramaty et al . 2000b ; ryan et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "however , olive et al .",
    "( 1994 ) pointed out that there remains a serious problem of overproduction of @xmath1b from the supernova @xmath17-process in the gce models of the light elements . here",
    "the overproduction means that the predicted @xmath1b abundance in theoretical calculations is overabundant compared to the observed one when we adopt the theoretical yields of ww95 without any renormalization .",
    "studies on gce have shown that light elements are mostly produced from galactic cosmic - ray ( gcr ) interactions with the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the gcr model was improved by taking account of the primary acceleration of heavy elements from supernova ejecta in addition to the secondary acceleration of the engulfing ism ( ramaty et al .",
    "1997 ; yoshii , kajino , & ryan 1997 ; vangioni - flam et al . 1998",
    "; suzuki , yoshii , & kajino 1999 ) .",
    "this explains the naturally linear metal dependence of the amounts of be and b during gce ; i.e. , [ beb / h ] @xmath18 [ fe / h ] , but one still needs another contribution to @xmath0li and @xmath1b ( olive et al .",
    "1994 ; vangioni - flam et al . 1996",
    "; fields & olive 1999 ; romano et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the production of @xmath1b in the supernova @xmath17-process is identified as the most important process for explaining the very precise data of the meteoritic @xmath1b/@xmath19b abundance ratio .",
    "several authors studied the gce models of the light elements by taking account of the contribution of the supernova @xmath17-process .",
    "they showed that the amount of @xmath1b is too large by a factor of 2 ( fields et al .",
    "2000 ) to 5 ( ramaty , lingenfelter , & kozolvsky 2000a ) , while the other light elements @xmath20li , @xmath0li , @xmath21be , and @xmath19b are well reproduced in the appropriate amount .",
    "mass loss of the outer envelope in the presupernova evolutionary phase would decrease the efficiency of @xmath1b production in the @xmath17-process during the supernova explosion .",
    "wolf - rayet stars in fact exhibit strong activities in their stellar atmosphere , such as mass loss .",
    "they originate from stars as massive as 40 @xmath5 ( e.g. , abbott & conti 1987 ; meynet et al .",
    "since the supernovae discussed in the present article have main - sequence masses of 13 - 30 @xmath5 , there is no need to take account of such a mass - loss effect .",
    "the production of @xmath0li and @xmath1b during the supernova explosion depends on the supernova models .",
    "it also depends on the details of the total neutrino luminosity and its time variation .",
    "moreover , the yet uncertain average neutrino energy should strongly affect the @xmath17-spallation cross sections of @xmath22he , providing seed elements for the production of @xmath0li and @xmath1b ( ww95 ) . since the supernova neutrinos would therefore affect the final abundance of @xmath0li and @xmath1b ( fields et al .",
    "2000 ; yoshida , emori , & nakazawa 2000 ) , we should investigate the dependence on the neutrino spectra to solve the overproduction problem .    following the core explosion of a supernova , a `` hot bubble ",
    "region , in which the density is relatively low and the temperature and entropy are high , is formed between the surface of the proto - neutron star and the outward shock wave . in the region near the surface of the proto - neutron star , the material is blown off by neutrino heating .",
    "the outflow of the material is also called the `` neutrino - driven wind  .",
    "woosley et al . ( 1994 ) showed that the @xmath2-process occurs successfully in neutrino - driven winds with very high entropy , @xmath23 , where @xmath10 denotes the boltzmann constant .",
    "however , their nucleosynthesis calculation did not include neutrino - nucleus interactions during the postprocessing of the nucleosynthesis .",
    "it was subsequently pointed out that the supernova neutrinos convert neutrons into protons during nucleosynthesis and that the @xmath2-process has difficulty in producing third - peak elements because of the neutron deficiency even in a high - entropy hot bubble ( fuller & meyer 1995 ; meyer 1995 ) .",
    "it was also reported that independent simulations of neutrino - driven winds have difficulty in producing the required high - entropy condition ( witti , janka & takahashi 1994 ; takahashi , witti , & janka 1994 ) .",
    "thus , neutrino - driven winds were suspected to be a site of the @xmath2-process .",
    "recently , neutrino - driven wind models have been revived as promising sites of @xmath2-process nucleosynthesis by using a moderately high entropy , @xmath24 , and a very short expansion timescale , @xmath25 ms ( otsuki et al . 2000 ; sumiyoshi et al . 2000 ) .",
    "massive ( @xmath26 ) and compact ( @xmath27 km ) neutron star models are assumed in order to obtain such conditions .",
    "it is known , however , that the typical mass of a neutron star is about @xmath28 and that the radius is about 10 km .",
    "terasawa et al . (",
    "2002 ) have recently shown the possibility for a successful @xmath2-process abundance pattern to emerge from a neutron star model with a typical mass of @xmath28 and a radius of @xmath27 km ; they use a slightly low asymptotic temperature at the outer boundary of the neutrino - driven winds . in all these simulations",
    ", they set the mean energies of neutrinos to be about @xmath29 , and @xmath30 mev for @xmath31 , and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 , and their antiparticles ) , respectively , to match with those adopted in a previous theoretical study ( qian & woosley 1996 ) .    in light of the successful @xmath2-process nucleosynthesis in neutrino - driven winds",
    ", it is of current interest and importance to study how to solve the overproduction problem of the light elements in the @xmath17-process in the same supernova model . since neutrinos are very weakly interacting particles , their energy spectrum would not change in the ejecta unless neutrino oscillation were considered .",
    "nevertheless , there was no attention given to the fact that the supernova neutrino model , which is used for light - element synthesis during supernova explosions , should be identical to that adopted in the neutrino - driven wind models .",
    "in the present study we use a common neutrino luminosity that decreases with time in the application to both light - element synthesis in the he layer and @xmath2-process synthesis in neutrino - driven winds .",
    "we investigate the sensitivity of light - element synthesis in supernova ejecta to the neutrino luminosity with the two parameters of the decay time @xmath4 and the total neutrino energy @xmath3 . at the same time",
    ", we simulate the neutrino - driven winds with the same neutrino luminosity parameters and calculate the @xmath2-process abundance pattern .",
    "we thus discuss the consistency between the light - element production and the abundance distribution of the @xmath2-process elements and try to solve the overproduction problem of the light elements in gce .",
    "in addition to the ambiguity of the neutrino luminosity , neutrino temperature is still a controversial problem .",
    "although extensive studies by supernova simulations with neutrino transfer have been done by several groups ( e.g. , janka , kilfonidis , & rampp 2001 ; liebendrfer et al . 2001",
    "; thompson , burrows , & pinto 2003 ; buras et al .",
    "2003 ) , the explosion mechanism has not yet been clarified .",
    "accordingly , the information on supernova neutrinos has not been uniquely determined .",
    "detailed studies on supernova neutrinos have been made to determine the neutrino luminosity and spectra ( myra & burrows 1990 ; suzuki 1994 ; totani et al .",
    "1998 ; keil , raffelt , & janka 2003 ) .",
    "hence , it is also important to investigate the sensitivity of the light - element production and the @xmath2-process abundance pattern to the temperature of the @xmath34- , @xmath35- , and @xmath36-neutrino families using a common luminosity for the supernova neutrinos .",
    "recent theoretical studies on explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae ( e.g. , rauscher et al .",
    "2002 ) have shown a smaller ejected mass of @xmath1b , moving toward a solution of the overproduction problem .",
    "they assumed slightly lower temperatures of @xmath35- and @xmath36-type neutrinos and their antiparticles ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) than those adopted in ww95 .",
    "we therefore explore many different neutrino luminosities with different neutrino temperatures to look for an appropriate ejected mass of @xmath1b and @xmath2-process abundance pattern .",
    "this result would in turn strongly constrain models of supernova neutrinos .",
    "in order to investigate the relation between the ejected mass of the light elements and the @xmath2-process abundance pattern , we use a common model of neutrino luminosity based on woosley et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and ww95 .",
    "the neutrino luminosity @xmath39 ( @xmath40 , and their antiparticles ) is the same for all species and exponentially decreases with a decay time @xmath4 @xmath41 where @xmath3 is the total neutrino energy , @xmath2 is the radius , @xmath42 is the speed of light , and @xmath43 is a step function defined by @xmath44 for @xmath45 and 0 otherwise .",
    "the total neutrino energy and the decay time of the neutrino luminosity are parameters . in the above two papers , the authors fixed @xmath8 s and @xmath46 ergs . here",
    ", we adopt a wider range for these parameters .",
    "we set the decay time in the range between 1 and 3 s. the total neutrino energy @xmath3 is evaluated as approximately 6 times the total energy emitted from electron antineutrinos . the determined total energy of @xmath47 from sn 1987a ( hirata et al .",
    "1987 ; bionta et al .",
    "1987 ) leads to a total neutrino energy ranging over @xmath48 ergs @xmath49 @xmath3 @xmath49 @xmath50 ergs ( suzuki 1994 ) .",
    "since the error bars are very large , depending on the different methods of maximum likelihood analysis of the observed data , we vary the total neutrino energy @xmath3 in the range between @xmath51 and @xmath52 ergs .    when we evaluate the reaction rates of the @xmath17-process and thermal evolution of the neutrino - driven winds , we further need to know the energy spectra of all species of neutrinos . strictly speaking",
    ", the neutrino energy spectra do not have a thermal distribution because of the strong energy dependence of weak interactions .",
    "however , for our present purpose of studying the @xmath17-process , the spectra of the neutrinos emitted from the warm surface of proto - neutron stars can be approximately expressed as a thermal distribution at a certain temperature .",
    "this is because only the high - energy tails of the spectra are important for the @xmath17-process .",
    "therefore , both the average energy of the neutrinos and the average cross sections can be calculated accordingly and have been widely utilized in the previous nucleosynthesis calculations in a standard manner . although some studies showed that these neutrino spectra may have a non zero chemical potential ( e.g. , myra & burrows 1990 ; hartmann et al .",
    "1999 ; keil et al .",
    "2003 ) , we assume that the chemical potential of the neutrinos is zero for all species , as done in the previous studies of light - element nucleosynthesis ( woosley et al . 1990 ; ww95 ; rauscher et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "we set the temperature of @xmath37 and @xmath38 as @xmath53 this value is taken from woosley et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and ww95 .",
    "the temperature corresponds to a mean energy of 25 mev .",
    "the temperatures of @xmath54 and @xmath47 are set to be @xmath55 @xmath56 respectively .",
    "the corresponding mean energies are 10 and 16 mev .",
    "let us remark that the temperatures of @xmath54 and @xmath47 are different from those in ww95 , who assumed the same temperature of 4 mev/@xmath10 for both @xmath54 and @xmath47 .",
    "more detailed numerical studies of supernova neutrinos ( e.g. , woosley et al .",
    "1994 ; janka et al .",
    "2001 ) showed that @xmath57 is lower than @xmath58 because the interactions of @xmath47 with protons freeze out at a higher density and temperature , whereas @xmath54 interacts with neutrons also at a lower density and temperature .",
    "we also note that a temperature for @xmath37 and @xmath38 lower than 8 mev/@xmath10 has been reported in recent studies of supernova neutrino spectra formation ( myra & burrows 1990 ; keil et al .",
    "a temperature lower than that in equation ( 2 ) , i.e. , @xmath59= 6 mev/@xmath10 , is also used in discussions below , as well as 8 mev/@xmath10 .",
    "we study light - element synthesis by a postprocessing nucleosynthesis calculation of a supernova explosion .",
    "the presupernova model is the 14e1 model ( shigeyama & nomoto 1990 ) , corresponding to a model for sn 1987a .",
    "this model is constructed from a precollapse 6 @xmath5 helium star ( nomoto & hashimoto 1988 ) and a 10.2 @xmath5 h - rich envelope .",
    "the chemical composition of the presupernova model is taken from the 14e1 model . in the h - rich envelope , the mass fractions of @xmath60h and @xmath22he",
    "are set to be @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively . for the postprocessing calculation ,",
    "the abundance distribution of the cno - elements is assumed to be the equilibrium values of the cno - cycle .",
    "the abundances of heavier elements are assumed to be one - third of those of the sola@xmath2-system abundances , i.e. , @xmath63 .    in order to calculate the light - element synthesis in the supernova by postprocessing",
    ", we have to know the time evolutions of the temperature , density , and radius during the supernova explosion . in the present study",
    "we evaluate the propagation of a shock wave during the supernova explosion using a spherically symmetric lagrangian ppm ( piecewise parabolic method ) code ( colella & woodward 1984 ; shigeyama et al .",
    "1992 ) which includes a small nuclear reaction network containing 13 kinds of @xmath64-nuclei .",
    "the explosion energy is set to be @xmath65 ergs and the location of the mass cut is assumed to be 1.61 @xmath5 .",
    "a nuclear reaction network for the postprocessing calculation of the light element synthesis consists of 291 nuclear species up to ge ( table 1 ) .",
    "reaction rates in this network are adopted from nacre ( angulo et al .",

    "we adopt models of neutrino - driven winds for the @xmath2-process nucleosynthesis in a core - collapse supernova explosion .",
    "the thermodynamic conditions of the neutrino - driven winds strongly depend on the neutrino properties .",
    "we use the same neutrino luminosity and temperature as we described in section 2.1 for numerical simulations of the neutrino - driven winds and the @xmath2-process nucleosynthesis . instead of following the time evolution of the neutrino luminosity ,",
    "we run a set of different simulations of the neutrino - driven winds with constant and different neutrino luminosities , and superpose the calculated results of nucleosynthesis as employed by wanajo et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2002 ) .",
    "this is a good approximation because the decay time of the neutrino luminosity with @xmath4 = 1 - 3 s is long enough compared to the expansion timescale of the neutrino - driven winds and the nuclear reaction timescale of @xmath64- and @xmath2-processes ( otsuki et al . 2000 ; terasawa et al .",
    "we refer to the time @xmath66 as when the luminosity decays to as low as @xmath67 ergs s@xmath68 .",
    "we choose three representative times at @xmath69 , and @xmath70 for each model of neutrino luminosity and superpose the three calculated results of hydrodynamic simulations and @xmath2-process nucleosynthesis ( see table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "to follow the hydrodynamic evolution of neutrino - driven winds , we employ an implicit numerical code for general - relativistic and spherically symmetric hydrodynamics ( yamada 1997 ; sumiyoshi et al .",
    "2000 ) , including the heating and cooling processes due to neutrinos ( qian & woosley 1996 ) . as an initial condition",
    ", we put thin surface material on a neutron star with a typical mass of @xmath28 and radius of @xmath27 km , which is the inner boundary condition .",
    "we obtain the initial structure of this material by solving the oppenheimer - volkoff equation . as an outer boundary condition",
    ", we put a constant pressure @xmath71 next to the outermost grid point of the lagrangian mesh .",
    "the value of @xmath71 is taken to be @xmath72 dyn @xmath73 for all simulations , since a low asymptotic temperature due to a low outer pressure is favorable for @xmath2-process nucleosynthesis ( terasawa et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "we start the network calculations of the nucleosynthesis at the time when the temperature drops to @xmath74 ( in units of @xmath75 k ) and follow the time evolution of the abundances .",
    "the reaction network covers over 3000 species of nuclei from the @xmath76-stability line to the neutron drip line including light neutron - rich unstable nuclei ( terasawa et al .",
    "it includes only the charged - current neutrino - nucleus interactions for all nuclei . since the neutral - current interactions have little influence on the final composition of the material when the timescale of expansion is very short ( terasawa et al .",
    "2003 ) , as in our present model , we did not include these reactions in the current studies of the @xmath2-process .    in order to estimate the total ejected mass of each isotope , @xmath77 , for a given neutrino luminosity",

    "we examine the influence of the neutrino luminosity on the ejected masses of @xmath0li and @xmath1b .",
    "figure 1 shows the mass fractions of the light elements as a function of the mass coordinate @xmath87 in the case of @xmath88 ergs and @xmath89 s , which is the same parameter set as adopted in ww95 .",
    "we see that @xmath0li and @xmath1b are abundantly produced in the he / c layer in the ranges of @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively .",
    "in addition , @xmath19b is produced in the regions below the he / n layer but less abundantly .",
    "a small amount of @xmath20li and @xmath21be are also produced in the o / c layer and the outer part of the he / c layer .",
    "let us first explain the main production process of the light elements . in the @xmath0li - production region ( @xmath90 ) , neutrinos emitted from the collapsed core break up @xmath22he through @xmath22he(@xmath92h and @xmath22he(@xmath93he .",

    "the other is that the ejected mass for a given @xmath3 is insensitive to the decay time @xmath4 . in table 2",
    "we list the sets of the two parameters adopted for the @xmath2-process calculations in the ranges of a total energy of @xmath106 ergs @xmath107 ergs and a decay time of 1 s @xmath108 3 s. in the given range of the total energy , the ejected masses of @xmath0li and @xmath1b change within a factor of 2.7 and a factor of 2.9 , respectively .",
    "the variations due to the decay time are within 10% for any @xmath3 values .",
    "hence , we can conclude that the ejected masses of @xmath0li and @xmath1b are almost proportional to the total energy , and the variation is within a factor of 3 , but insensitive to the decay time .    a simple relation between the ejected mass and the total neutrino energy arises from the following specific properties of the reaction processes that produce @xmath0li and @xmath1b . in the he / c - layer , @xmath0li and @xmath1b",
    "are mainly produced through the three reaction chains    @xmath109    @xmath110    @xmath111    at higher temperatures , a @xmath1b(@xmath104n reaction also occurs .",
    "all these reaction sequences are triggered by neutrino spallations , and followed by @xmath64-capture reactions .",
    "the neutrino number flux is proportional to the total neutrino energy .",
    "the spallation reaction rates for @xmath22he(@xmath92h , @xmath22he(@xmath93he , and @xmath99c(@xmath100b are also proportional to it .",
    "the amounts of seed nuclei of @xmath0li and @xmath1b , namely , @xmath22he and @xmath99c , are determined solely by the composition of the presupernova star and are independent of the neutrino luminosity .",
    "although the mass of @xmath22he and @xmath99c in the he layer changes depending on the presupernova model , the ejected masses of @xmath0li and @xmath1b are almost proportional to the total neutrino energy alone .",
    "this is because the production regions of these nuclei are limited to within the middle of the he layer .",
    "we turn to the insensitivity of the ejected masses of @xmath0li and @xmath1b to the decay time of the neutrino luminosity , as evidenced in figure 2 . in the @xmath0li- and @xmath1b - production regions ,",
    "their mass fractions do not strongly depend on the decay time .",
    "this is because all neutrinos promptly pass through the region before the shock arrival , and @xmath0li and @xmath1b are not effectively processed after the shock passes by . in the bottom of the he",
    "/ c layer ( @xmath112 ) , where both @xmath0li and @xmath1b are scarcely produced , the shock wave arrives earlier ( about 10 s ) , and further @xmath64-capture reactions on the produced @xmath0li and @xmath1b proceed for several seconds after the shock arrival . these @xmath64-capture processes",
    "do not depend on @xmath4 .",
    "however , there is a slight difference , about 10% , between the two cases of @xmath4= 1 and 3 s. this arises from the competition between the shock arrival and the timescale of the production processes of @xmath0li and @xmath1b through the @xmath17-process , which depends on @xmath4 . in the case of @xmath4=3",
    "s , a fractional part of @xmath0li and @xmath1b is still being produced through the @xmath17-process even after the shock arrival . in the case of @xmath4=1",
    "s , however , the @xmath17-process ends shortly before the shock arrival , so that the produced @xmath0li and @xmath1b capture @xmath22he when the shock arrives .",
    "this difference leads to a small decrease in the amounts of @xmath0li and @xmath1b in the case of @xmath4=1 s compared to @xmath4= 3 s.    finally , we compare our result with the ejected masses of @xmath0li and @xmath1b in the s20a model of ww95 . in the case of @xmath113 ergs and @xmath4=3 s ,",
    "the obtained masses of @xmath0li and @xmath1b in our calculation are @xmath114 and @xmath115 @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the masses of @xmath0li and @xmath1b in the s20a model are @xmath116 and @xmath117 , respectively ( see fig . 2 , _ solid horizontal line _ ) .",
    "our result is in reasonable agreement with ww95 , such that the calculated masses of @xmath0li and @xmath1b are 12% and 4% larger than the corresponding masses in the s20a model .    in order to investigate the effects of the different temperatures of @xmath54 and @xmath47 , we also calculated the masses of @xmath0li and @xmath1b with @xmath118=4 mev/@xmath10 , as adopted in ww95 .",
    "the obtained masses of @xmath0li and @xmath1b are 9 % and 1 % larger than the corresponding masses in the s20a model , so that the difference becomes even smaller .",
    "as shown in this section , the main contribution of the @xmath17-process reactions is neutral - current interactions of @xmath37 and @xmath38 due to their temperatures being higher than those of @xmath54 and @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , the difference due to the temperatures of @xmath54 and @xmath47 does not affect very much the ejected masses of @xmath0li and @xmath1b .",
    "this agreement confirms that the overproduction problem of @xmath1b in the context of the gce of light elements still remains independent of specific supernova models .",
    "we discuss how to solve this problem in section 4 .",
    "the final total isotopic distribution of the ejected mass of the @xmath2-process elements is presented as a function of mass number in figure [ final ] for the three sets of neutrino luminosities listed in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the dashed line refers to the case with",
    "_ low _ total neutrino energy , @xmath119 erg , and _ long _ decay time , @xmath120 s ( ll model ) .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the case with @xmath119 ergs and _ short _ decay time , @xmath121 s ( ls model ) .",
    "the dotted line shows the case with _",
    "high _ total neutrino energy , @xmath7 erg , and _ long _ decay time , @xmath122 s ( hl model ) .",
    "we can observe in this figure that the third peak elements are synthesized in all three models , although the height of the peak and the ejected mass of these elements largely differ .",
    "let us first compare the result of the ll model with that of the ls model in order to investigate the dependence of the final abundance distribution on the decay time .",
    "figure [ final ] shows that the ejected mass in the ls model is larger than in the ll model . since the value of @xmath3 is the same between these two models , the difference of @xmath4 leads directly to a different value for the neutrino luminosity ( see eq . [ 1 ] and table 2 ) . in the ls model with the short decay timescale , @xmath121 s ,",
    "the peak luminosity @xmath123 is higher than in the ll model with the long decay time scale , @xmath120 s , because of a common total neutrino energy , @xmath119 erg .",
    "it is known that the mass ejection rate increases as fast as the luminosity increases , i.e. , @xmath124 ( woosley et al .",
    "1994 ) ; the mass ejection at high luminosity is dominant in the whole wind .",
    "the total ejected mass is mainly determined by the peak luminosity , which is in turn related by the decay time .",
    "accordingly , a shorter decay time leads to a larger total ejected mass .",
    "second , we find the interesting fact that the abundance ratio of the third- to the second - peak elements in the ll model is larger than in the ls model .",
    "the reason is as follows : from previous studies of neutrino - driven winds , favorable conditions for a successful @xmath2-process have been identified : they are a higher entropy ( @xmath125 ) , shorter dynamical timescale ( @xmath126 ) , lower electron fraction ( @xmath127 ; e.g. , meyer & brown 1997 ) , and lower asymptotic temperature ( @xmath128 ; terasawa et al . 2002 ; wanajo et al . 2002 ; otsuki , mathews , & kajino 2003 ) . in our present model calculations ,",
    "@xmath127 and @xmath128 are almost the same because we employ a common neutrino temperature and the same outer boundary conditions .",
    "it was also found that the entropy and the dynamical time scale become larger as the neutrino luminosity is lower ( qian & woosley 1996 ; otsuki et al .",
    "2000 ; sumiyoshi et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath125 and @xmath126 change depending on @xmath4 through the change of the neutrino luminosity . even combining the above theoretical findings",
    ", one can not simply explain the difference of the third - to - second peak abundance ratios between the ls model and the ll model , because the resulting effects from the change in @xmath125 and @xmath126 counteract the production efficiency of the @xmath2-process elements . from our numerical calculations , we find that the gain for the @xmath2-process nucleosynthesis due to the increase of entropy is quantitatively larger than the loss due to the increase of the dynamical timescale .",
    "this means that more abundant third - peak elements relative to second - peak elements are synthesized as the luminosity becomes lower . in both the ls and ll models ,",
    "the efficiency of producing the third - peak elements is higher for @xmath129 than for @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "in addition , as we discussed in the previous paragraph , the peak luminosity in the ll model is lower than in the ls model ( see table 2 ) . for these reasons ,",
    "the efficiency of producing the third - peak elements in the ll model is most prominent , leading to a larger abundance ratio of the third- to the second - peak elements in the ll model than in the ls model .",
    "we next consider the dependence on the total neutrino energy @xmath3 .",
    "we compare the results of the ll and hl models in figure [ final ] .",
    "since these two models have different total energies ( see table 2 ) with a common decay time , the total ejected mass is larger , and the third- to second peak ratio is smaller in the hl model than in the ll model for the reasons discussed in the previous paragraphs .",
    "finally , we compare the hl model with the ls model .",
    "we obtain the result that the pattern of isotopic abundance distribution is exactly the same in these two models , although the ejected mass in the hl model is larger .",
    "this is because @xmath132 , and @xmath84 , defined below equation ( 5 ) ( see also table 2 ) depend only on @xmath6 ( see eq . [ 1 ] ) and thus their values are exactly the same between these models . as a result , we find that the key quantity is the neutrino luminosity for determining the pattern of the @xmath2-process abundance distribution in our study .    in summary ,",
    "a lower peak luminosity is preferable in order to obtain a successful @xmath2-process abundance pattern . in figure",
    "[ final ] we also display the comparison of our calculated results with the solar @xmath2-process abundance pattern ( kppeler , beer , & wisshak 1989 ) shifted to the value of the ll model at the second peak .",
    "we can conclude that the ll model is the best among our adopted three models in order to reproduce the solar @xmath2-process abundance pattern .",
    "note that if we change the decay time of the hl model ( @xmath113 erg ) to 9 s , the pattern of the abundance distribution becomes the same as for the ll model .",
    "this modification of the decay time is discussed in section 4.3 .",
    "in this section , we discuss the constraint on the supernova neutrinos from the contribution of the two nucleosynthesis processes to gce .",
    "we then propose new supernova neutrino modeling to solve the overproduction problem of @xmath1b .",
    "we also discuss the consistency of the @xmath2-process abundance pattern using the new model .",
    "let us first discuss the overproduction problem of @xmath1b .",
    "recently , the studies on the gce of the light elements have shown that @xmath0li and @xmath1b originate from supernova explosions as well as gcr interactions with the ism ( e.g. , olive et al .",
    "the contribution from supernova explosions is evaluated so that the predicted @xmath1b/@xmath19b ratio at solar metallicity agrees with the meteoritic ratio .",
    "the evaluated contribution of @xmath1b from supernovae is smaller than that predicted from the supernova explosion models in ww95 .",
    "several authors have investigated the gce of the light elements and have introduced a reduction factor @xmath133 as the ratio of the amount of @xmath1b determined in the gce model to that evaluated in ww95 ( e.g. , vangioni - flam et al .",
    "1996 ; fields & olive 1999 ) .",
    "namely , the amount of @xmath1b is the same as that in ww95 for @xmath134 and is less than that for @xmath135 .",
    "fields et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , ramaty et al .",
    "( 2000a , 2000b ) , and alibs , labay , & canal ( 2002 ) have evaluated the factor @xmath133 to be 0.40 , 0.18 , 0.28 , and 0.29 , respectively .",
    "the scatter in @xmath133 is mainly caused by the different treatment of gcrs : the assumed chemical composition and energy spectra of the gcrs .",
    "since the factor @xmath136 still depends on the treatment of gcrs and has not been precisely determined , we set an acceptable range of the reduction factor to be @xmath137 the ejected masses of @xmath1b with the largest and smallest values as denoted by @xmath138 and 0.18 together with that of ww95 are shown in figure _",
    "2b_.    figure _ 2b _ shows that the ejected mass of @xmath1b meets with the above range of @xmath136 ( see eq . [ 6 ] ) only when the total neutrino energy is as low as @xmath139 erg .",
    "this energy is much lower than @xmath140 erg , which is the value used in ww95 in accordance with the value constrained from the observation of sn 1987a . in this energy range the ejected mass of @xmath0li",
    "is also smaller than that in ww95 as shown in figure _",
    "2a_.      we turn now to the constraint from the @xmath2-process nucleosynthesis .",
    "the total ejected mass of heavy @xmath2-process elements , @xmath141 , is between @xmath142 ( for the ll model ) and @xmath143 ( for the hl model ) .",
    "this range is consistent with the gce of the @xmath2-process elements : assuming that the type ii supernova rate is on the order of @xmath144 yr@xmath68 over the entire history of galactic evolution , the current mass of the @xmath2-process elements in the galaxy is estimated to be @xmath145 ( for the ll model ) and @xmath146 ( for the hl model ) . since the total baryonic mass of the galaxy is @xmath147 , our models lead to a present mass fraction in @xmath2-process elements of the order of @xmath148 ( for the ll model ) and @xmath149 ( for the hl model ) .",
    "these values are in reasonable agreement with the observed solar mass fraction of @xmath149 .",
    "we recall furthermore the discussion in section 3.2 that the third - to - second peak ratio is sensitive to the neutrino luminosity and that the ll model in table 2 ( @xmath150 ergs and @xmath4 = 3.0 s ) is most favorable for explaining the observed @xmath2-process abundance pattern .",
    "thus , summarizing the constraints from the two nucleosynthesis processes , a neutrino luminosity with @xmath150 ergs can resolve the overproduction problem of @xmath1b and the @xmath2-process abundance pattern as long as the decay @xmath4 is longer than or equal to 3 s.      the neutrino luminosity model suggested above , however , encounters a potential conflict between the total neutrino energy @xmath3 and the gravitational mass of the neutron star formed in type ii supernova explosion .",
    "lattimer & yahil ( 1989 ) suggested an approximate relation between the gravitational binding energy @xmath151 and the neutron star mass @xmath152 . since it is known that almost 99 % of the binding energy is released as supernova neutrinos , @xmath151 , is equal to @xmath3 to a very good approximation .",
    "their suggested relation is therefore expressed as @xmath153 this formulation is shown to be a reasonable approximation in the theoretical studies of several non - relativistic potential models and field theoretical models ( prakash et al .",
    "1997 ; lattimer & prakash 2001 ) . using this formulation ,",
    "the total neutrino energy for a neutron star mass of 1.4 @xmath5 turns out to be @xmath154 within @xmath155 % error bars .",
    "this range is displayed by two vertical lines in figures _",
    "2a _ and _ 2b_.",
    "although we summarized above that the most suitable total neutrino energy is @xmath119 ergs from the constraints on the two nucleosynthesis processes , it is inconsistent with equation ( 8) which is based on the neutron star formation conjecture in a type ii supernova explosion .    in order to solve this inconsistency , we modify the temperature of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , which we set to be 8 mev/@xmath10 as in ww95 , and reset the decay time of the neutrino luminosity .",
    "rauscher et al . (",
    "2002 ) have tried to reduce the amount of @xmath1b by decreasing these neutrino temperatures from @xmath156 mev/@xmath10 to @xmath157 mev/@xmath10 .",
    "although the spectrum of the neutrinos emitted from a proto - neutron star has not been determined , some recent studies show the neutrino temperature to be smaller than 8 mev/@xmath10 ( e.g. , myra & burrows 1990 ; keil et al .",
    "we therefore adopt the same lower temperature for @xmath37 and @xmath38 of 6 mev/@xmath10 .",
    "in section 3.2 we showed that the ll model is the most favorable for explaining the observed @xmath2-process abundance pattern and that a lower peak luminosity is preferable .",
    "however , the total neutrino energy of the ll model is outside the range of equation ( 8) . in order to cure the situation , we set a longer decay time for the neutrino luminosity : @xmath4= 9 s. using the long decay time , we can attain the total neutrino energy in the range of equation ( 8) while still preserving the lower peak neutrino luminosity ( see eq . [ 1 ] ) .",
    "we show the ejected masses of @xmath0li and @xmath1b in the case of @xmath59= 6 mev/@xmath10 and @xmath4= 9 s by a dashed line in figure 2 .",
    "the ejected masses of @xmath0li and @xmath1b decrease drastically compared to those in the case of @xmath59=8 mev/@xmath10 .",
    "this is because smaller amounts of seed nuclei , such as @xmath94h and @xmath94he for the production of @xmath0li and @xmath1b , are provided from the neutrino spallation of @xmath22he due to smaller cross sections of neutral - current interactions at the lower neutrino temperature .",
    "we also consider the case of a decay time of 3 s ( fig . 2 , _ dot - dashed line _ ) .",
    "as shown in section 3.1 , the masses of @xmath0li and @xmath1b scarcely depend on the decay time even in the case of @xmath59= 6 mev/@xmath10 .",
    "let us compare the ejected mass of @xmath1b again with that required from the gce models .",
    "it now turns out to be in the proper range required from the gce model analyses ( eq . [ 6 ] ) , where the total neutrino energy @xmath3 is between @xmath158 and @xmath159 ergs ( see fig .",
    "the proper range clearly overlaps with the range deduced from the restriction with the neutron star mass constraint in equation ( 8) .",
    "hence , we can conclude that the ejected mass of @xmath1b required from the gce models is successfully reproduced with the appropriate total neutrino energy when one adopts the neutrino temperature of 6 mev/@xmath10 and a decay time of the neutrino luminosity of 9 s. the ejected masses of @xmath0li and @xmath1b are @xmath160 @xmath161 respectively .",
    "now we consider the effects of these lower neutrino temperatures on the @xmath2-process nucleosynthesis .",
    "we adopt the mll ( _ modified _ ll ) model in table 2 with a total neutrino energy of @xmath140 ergs and a decay time of the neutrino luminosity of @xmath162 s. the neutrino luminosities of this model are the same as those of the ll model ( see table 2 ) .",
    "when we reduce the neutrino temperature from @xmath156 mev/@xmath10 to @xmath157 mev/@xmath10 , the dynamical timescale of expansion in the neutrino - driven winds becomes slightly longer , by only a few milliseconds .",
    "however , this effect does not drastically change the @xmath2-process abundance pattern , although the ejected mass is different , mainly owing to the different @xmath70 values ( see eq . [ 5 ] ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the resulting abundance pattern of the mll model ( @xmath163 mev/@xmath10 ) , with stars showing the solar @xmath2-process abundances ( kppeler et al .",
    "1989 ) shifted to the value of the mll model at the second peak . by comparison with the ll model ( the dashed line , which is the same as that in figure 3 ) , which is the best case at @xmath164 mev/@xmath10 , the third - to - second peak ratio slightly increases .",
    "we therefore conclude that a lower neutrino temperature is preferable for not only light elements but also heavy @xmath2-process elements .",
    "these low temperatures are acceptable from the point of view of recent studies on supernova neutrinos ( myra & burrows 1990 ; keil et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "finally , we obtained the mass of @xmath1b suitable for the gce of the light elements and a successful @xmath2-process abundance pattern satisfying the restriction on the total neutrino energy from a typical neutron star mass when we adopt the temperature of @xmath37 and @xmath38 to be 6 mev/@xmath10 and the decay time of the neutrino luminosity to be 9 s.",
    "we investigated the influence of the total neutrino energy and the decay time of the neutrino luminosity on the light - element synthesis .",
    "we also investigated the @xmath2-process nucleosynthesis in neutrino - driven winds with the same neutrino luminosity .",
    "we summarize our findings .    first , the ejected masses of @xmath0li and @xmath1b are roughly proportional to the total neutrino energy .",
    "the difference due to the decay time of the neutrino luminosity is small , i.e. , within 20% .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain the ejected masses of the light elements precisely , it is important to determine the total neutrino energy rather than the decay time of the neutrino luminosity .",
    "second , results of the @xmath2-process nucleosynthesis depend on the peak neutrino luminosity , which depends on @xmath3/@xmath4 .",
    "although the @xmath2-process is sensitive to the total energy of the neutrinos , only the ejected mass is affected strongly . in order to obtain a successful @xmath2-process abundance pattern ,",
    "a low peak luminosity is preferable , such as obtained in the ll model ( see table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "we discussed the contributions of @xmath1b and @xmath2-process elements from supernovae to the galactic chemical evolution .",
    "we found that the preferred total neutrino energy is about @xmath51 ergs and the decay time of the neutrino flux should be longer than or equal to 3 s when we set the temperature of @xmath37 and @xmath38 to be 8 mev/@xmath10 .",
    "however , assuming the mass of the proto - neutron star formed in a supernova explosion to be 1.4 @xmath5 , the total neutrino energy is evaluated to be about @xmath140 ergs ( lattimer & prakash 2001 ) .",
    "the model mentioned above is inconsistent with this total energy .",
    "we propose a new supernova neutrino modeling to overcome this inconsistency : to reduce the temperature of @xmath37 and @xmath38 to @xmath157 mev/@xmath10 , as used in rauscher et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and to raise the decay time of the neutrino luminosity to 9 s. with these modifications of the supernova neutrino modeling we successfully obtain the proper ejected mass of @xmath1b and the @xmath2-process abundance pattern .",
