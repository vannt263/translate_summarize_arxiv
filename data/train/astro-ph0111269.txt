    "supernova ( sn ) 1998s in ngc  3877 was discovered by li & wan ( 1998 ) , probably before maximum light ( fassia et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the presence of narrow lines in its early - time spectra led to its classification as a type  iin ( sn  iin ) ( leonard et al . 2000 ) . nevertheless , the close resemblance of its light curve and spectral development to those of sn  1979c ( liu et al .",
    "2000 ) means that it is also valid to classify sn  1998s as another bright sn  iil .",
    "whatever the assigned class , there is strong evidence for the existence of a dense circumstellar ( cs ) wind in its immediate vicinity of sn  1998s .",
    "this includes the presence of narrow cs lines ( bowen et al .",
    "2000 ; fassia et al . 2001 ) , broad emission lines originating from the interaction ( leonard et al . 2000 ; gerardy et al .",
    "2000 ; fassia et al . 2001 ) , and radio and x - ray emission ( pooley et al . 2001 ) .",
    "despite extensive effort in the past , we still have a poor understanding of the origin of the large pre - supernova mass loss and the ejecta - wind interaction phenomenon in sne  iin .",
    "sn  1998s is the most comprehensively observed sn  iin , thus providing us with an excellent opportunity for gaining a deeper insight into the morphology and origin of the dense cs environment and the physics of the interaction . of particular interest",
    "is the origin of two distinct cs wind velocity components deduced from high resolution early - time spectra of sn  1998s taken at @xmath325 weeks after the explosion ( bowen et al . 2000 ; fassia et al . 2001 ) .",
    "these had velocities of @xmath4 km s@xmath1 , and @xmath5 km s@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the slower component is revealed by both narrow h  i and he  i p  cygni profiles and forbidden lines , while the faster component is seen only in broader h  i and he  i absorption lines .",
    "the minima of the broad h@xmath6 and h@xmath7 absorptions shifted from @xmath3115  km s@xmath1 on 1998 march  20 to @xmath385  km s@xmath1 by 1998 april  8 .",
    "similarly broad cs absorption lines are also seen in high resolution ultraviolet ( uv ) spectra via the mg  ii 2800  doublet ( bowen et al . 2000 ) .",
    "while the presence of the slow wind is unsurprising for a sn  ii progenitor , the origin of the faster cs material ( csm ) is not clear .",
    "bowen et al . ( 2000 ) suggest it originated as a pre - existing fast wind component ( fast shell ) .",
    "fassia et al . (",
    "2001 ) suggest it was due to a faster wind produced during a recent bsg phase .",
    "a third possibility is that it was due to pre - shock radiative acceleration of the slow wind ( lentz et al .",
    "2001 ; fassia et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "in this paper we shall focus on the nature of the fast cs component which , we believe , is related to the structure of both the wind and the ejecta - wind interface .",
    "we start with a study of the kinematics and location of the fast cs gas ( section 2 ) , making use of the high resolution profiles of balmer lines observed on 1998 march 20 and 1998 april 8 ( bowen et al . 2000 ; fassia et al . 2001 ) . through our modelling of the cs gas line profiles",
    ", we reveal that the fast cs component appears to lie very close to the sn photosphere .",
    "indeed , this proximity presents a challenge in understanding the structure of the ejecta - wind interface",
    ". a solution will be proposed .",
    "we then consider the plausibility that the fast cs gas results from the pre - shock acceleration of the slow wind by radiation or relativistic particles from the sn .",
    "( section 3 ) . as an alternative explanation ,",
    "we also investigate shocked dense wind clumps ( section 4 ) .",
    "we note that the cs wind considered here corresponds to the ` mid - csm / outer - csm ' regions defined in fassia et al .",
    "this will be discussed further in section  5 , where we conclude that the division into mid- and outer - csm zones is probably not required after all .",
    "the ` inner - csm ' region ( fassia et al . 2001 ) , overrun by the ejecta around 2  weeks post - explosion , is examined by chugai ( 2001 ) .",
    "based on chugai s ( 2001 ) model for the sn - csm interaction and the light curve , we prefer 1998 february 25 as the date of the sn  1998s explosion . adopting this as zero epoch , march 20 and april 8 become days  23 and 42 , respectively .",
    "this should be kept in mind when comparing this work with other papers on sn  1998s .",
    "in the standard picture of spherically symmetric sn ejecta interaction with a smooth cs wind , the ejecta - wind interface has a two - shock structure with the outer and inner shocks running outward into the wind and inward into the ejecta , respectively ( chevalier 1982 ; nadyozhin 1981 , 1985 ) .",
    "we define a wind density parameter ( linear density ) @xmath8 , ( g cm@xmath1 ) , where @xmath10 is the density of the unshocked cs wind . with @xmath11 g cm@xmath1 , which is typical for sne  ii with dense winds ( e.g. sn  1979c , see lundqvist & fransson 1988 ) , the inner shock wave is radiative",
    ". consequently , a cool ( @xmath12 k ) dense shell ( cds ) of shocked sn ejecta forms between the outer and inner shocks ( chevalier & fransson 1985 , 1994 ) .    to investigate the origin of the cs line profiles , we consider a model of the line - forming region specified in terms of a ) the photospheric radius , @xmath13 , b ) the extent of a shell of fast cs gas , @xmath14 , and c ) the extent of a slow external wind , @xmath15 .",
    "we express the radii in terms of the photospheric radius , i.e. @xmath16 , unless the physical units are needed .",
    "the model is similar , in some respects , to that of lentz et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , but with two important differences .",
    "first , in their model there is a significant `` sn atmosphere '' zone lying between the sn photosphere and fast cs gas ( @xmath17 ) . in our model",
    "the sn atmosphere is absent ( we explain why below )",
    ". there may be a layer of very hot ionised post - shock gas between the photosphere and the fast cs gas ( @xmath18 ) , which does not contribute to line emission or absorption in the optical , but reprocesses the photospheric spectrum in the ultraviolet due to comptonization ( lundqvist et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "second , in lentz et al .",
    "the velocity within the fast cs gas is assumed constant , while in our model the velocity can vary with radius . since the kinematic structure of the resulting fast cs gas is not known , we consider initially three different possibilities : ( a ) a fast , constant velocity wind , ( b ) an accelerated flow with a positive velocity gradient , @xmath19 , ( this might arise from a cs shell lost in a violent mass ejection before the sn explosion ( grasberg & nadyozhin 1987 ) ) , ( c ) an accelerated flow with a negative velocity gradient ( @xmath20 ) , characteristic of pre - shock acceleration of the slow wind .",
    "for the case with a negative velocity gradient , we adopt as the description of the fast cs gas velocity @xmath21 :    @xmath22 + u_{\\rm w } , \\label{eq : vel}\\ ] ]    where @xmath23 , the velocity of the slow wind , is assumed to be constant with radius .",
    "thus the velocity of the accelerated cs gas is @xmath24 at its innermost limit @xmath25 , falling to @xmath26 at its outermost limit @xmath27 where it merges with the unaccelerated cs wind .",
    "note that @xmath28 corresponds to a very steep velocity gradient , while @xmath29 gives a mild slope .",
    "given the population of the second level @xmath30 , and the line source function @xmath31 , the cs gas line profile can then be easily calculated for the velocity fields specified in ( a)(c ) above .",
    "we do not compute the actual hydrogen level population in the wind ( although this is itself an interesting problem ) .",
    "instead , we parameterize the behaviour of @xmath30 and @xmath31 . specifically , we adopt a power law distribution for the second level population @xmath32 for @xmath33 , with @xmath34 and @xmath35 as free parameters .",
    "we split the h@xmath6 source function into net emission and scattering terms , respectively @xmath36 and @xmath37 , with @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the dilution factor and @xmath41 is the continuum intensity .",
    "this representation reduces uncertainty in the h@xmath6 source function . for other balmer lines we can not assume such a simple representation of the source function .",
    "however , the scattering term contribution is expected to be substantially lower than for h@xmath6 , and so we simply adopt the power law @xmath42 for these lines . rather than using the sobolev escape approximation , we directly integrated the radiative transfer equation , adopting a gaussian local profile with a thermal most probable velocity @xmath43 .",
    "the model parameters comprised @xmath25 , @xmath27 , @xmath44 , @xmath24 , @xmath26 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath35 , @xmath47 , @xmath34 and @xmath48 .",
    ".parameters of illustrative fast cs gas line profile models [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab1 ]",
    "between the two epochs ( 23 and 42  d ) the photospheric radius expanded by a factor of @xmath49 ( fassia et al .",
    "2000 ) . yet",
    "the above analysis indicates that , at both epochs , the fast cs gas resided in a thin shell ( @xmath50 ) attached to the photosphere .",
    "moreover , the gas flow in this shell has a negative velocity gradient , declining from the maximal velocity to @xmath51 km s@xmath1 at the inner edge of the disturbed slow wind .",
    "all this leads us to the proposition that the fast cs gas is not a pre - existing flow , nor is it accelerated shortly after the explosion by the radiation from the shock breakout , but instead is created by the ongoing acceleration of the slow wind in the immediate vicinity of the photosphere .",
    "the acceleration might be produced by the sn radiation ( chevalier 1981 ) and/or a relativistic particle precursor ( chugai 1997 ) .",
    "the acceleration of an ionised , optically thin wind via thomson scattering was invoked to explain the fast cs features observed in sn  1993j at early epochs ( fransson , lundqvist & chevalier 1996 ) . ignoring the initial wind velocity",
    ", thomson scattering can accelerate the cs gas at radius @xmath52 up to @xmath53 km s@xmath1 , where @xmath54 is the time - integrated radiation energy in units of @xmath55 erg , and @xmath56 is @xmath52 in units of @xmath57 cm .",
    "fransson et al .",
    "( 1996 ) estimated that @xmath58 for sn  1993j using explosion models and calculating the emission from the circumstellar shock .",
    "for sn  1998s we have no information on the total luminosity for the early evolution until the estimates for the bolometric luminosity of fassia et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , starting on day 17 . integrating the estimated bolometric luminosity between days 17 and 42 , we obtain @xmath59 if we assume that the spectrum is blackbody .",
    "there is probably considerable uncertainty in this estimate .",
    "we have not included the early emission from the photosphere and from the circumstellar interaction , which may lead to an underestimate , but we have also ignored the effects of uv line blanketing in the blackbody approximation , thus producing a possible overestimate . however , the bolometric luminosity is certainly considerably higher than for sn 1993j , with a likely range of @xmath60 . remarkably , in the sn  ii models of falk & arnett ( 1977 ) with an extended presupernova envelope of a size and density similar to those of the sn  1998s inner shell ( chugai 2001 ) , the radiated energy @xmath61 .    on day 42 , @xmath62 ( fassia et al",
    ". 2000 ) which , with @xmath63 , yields @xmath64  km s@xmath1 for the cs gas .",
    "this is faster than the slow wind velocity of @xmath65 km s@xmath1 , suggesting that the observed slow wind may have undergone some radiative acceleration following the supernova explosion .",
    "yet these velocities are insufficient to account for the fast cs shell at this epoch .",
    "the same is true for day 23 when @xmath66 .",
    "the value of @xmath54 is even more uncertain at that epoch , probably in the range @xmath67 , using the results of fassia et al .",
    "the corresponding velocity range for the cs gas is then @xmath68  km s@xmath1 , again too low for the fast cs gas .",
    "we therefore have to seek an additional acceleration mechanism to account for the velocity of the fast cs gas .",
    "the radiative force can be enhanced by including the effects of uv line absorption .",
    "this mechanism was exploited by castor , abbott & klein ( 1975 ) to account for hot star winds .",
    "it was also invoked by chevalier ( 1981 ) to explain the fast cs features in sn  1979c via radiative acceleration in the pre - shock zone , and discussed by fransson ( 1986 ) who argued that lines could pre - accelerate the gas up to @xmath69 more efficiently than thomson scattering .    the radiative force per unit volume due to the line absorption effect ( castor et al .",
    "1975 ) is @xmath70 , \\label{eq : force}\\ ] ]    where @xmath71 is the monochromatic flux .",
    "@xmath72 is the radial sobolev optical depth in the line , where @xmath73 is summed over the total number of lines with the lines arranged in order of frequency . from the dependence of the velocity gradient on @xmath74 we see that line acceleration is a runaway effect ; the gas that has been accelerated is also the gas that most easily gets further accelerated .",
    "this means that a steeper velocity profile can be created than with pure thomson scattering ( see also fransson 1986 ) , thus providing an explanation for the line profiles in section  2 .",
    "another mechanism which can steepen the velocity profile is related to the degradation of the uv radiation due to photon splitting .",
    "this results in a more efficient acceleration in the inner layers of the pre - shock zone , where the uv flux is greater .",
    "clearly , an adequate treatment of the line effects in radiative acceleration requires the solution of the radiative transfer with the statistical equilibrium of ions and level populations .",
    "this is a formidably complicated task , beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we shall , instead , restrict ourselves to estimating the radiative force and then the velocity increase due to the lines effect .",
    "let @xmath75 be the ratio of line absorption force @xmath74 to the thomson scattering force @xmath76 ( @xmath77 is the total radiation flux integrated over wavelength ) . using the equation of motion ,",
    "the velocity change of the fast cs gas due to the lines effect in the pre - shock zone @xmath78 may then be written approximately as    @xmath79    where @xmath80 is the radius of the outer shock ,",
    "@xmath81 @xmath82 g@xmath1 is the thomson opacity , and @xmath83 is the outer shock wave velocity , which we also identify with the velocity of the cds .    to estimate the radiative force due to line absorption we use the list of @xmath84 lines with @xmath85 compiled by ron eastman ( blinnikov et al .",
    "1998 ) and extended here using the r.l .",
    "kurucz data base available on the web .",
    "solar composition and a saha - boltzmann distribution are assumed , while the photospheric radiation is treated as black - body with the flux @xmath86 . in fig .",
    "6 we show @xmath87 as a function of temperature for densities of @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 g @xmath91 .",
    "( we note that these values are consistent with the lower limit @xmath92  @xmath91 obtained by fassia et al .",
    "( 2001 ) from observed [ o  iii ] line ratios . )",
    "the velocity gradient in eq .",
    "( [ eq : force ] ) is taken to be @xmath93 , with @xmath94 km s@xmath1 and @xmath95 cm .",
    "the results indicate that @xmath75 is lower for higher densities .",
    "this is due to line saturation effects [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : uprec3 ] ) ] .",
    "the non - monotonic temperature behaviour is due to the strong temperature dependence of the ionisation fractions in different ions .",
    "the low temperature peak at 60007000  k is caused primarily by the low ionisation ions of fe .    on day  23 , with the photospheric radius at @xmath96 cm ( fassia et al .",
    "2000 ) , the average radius of the fast cs shell is @xmath97 cm .",
    "therefore , a wind linear density @xmath98 g cm@xmath1 would correspond to the density @xmath99 g @xmath91 . with the equilibrium temperature",
    "@xmath100  k ( fassia et al . 2000 ) we have thus @xmath101 ( fig .",
    "6 ) . adopting eq.([eq :",
    "uprec3 ] ) @xmath102 cm , @xmath103 km s@xmath1 ( chugai 2001 ) , luminosity @xmath104 erg s@xmath1 ( fassia et al .",
    "2000 ) , and @xmath105 , we obtain from eq.([eq : uprec3 ] ) @xmath106 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the integrated acceleration due to thomson scattering was estimated above as @xmath107 km s@xmath1 for this particular epoch . in combination with the lines effect ,",
    "this yields @xmath108 km s@xmath1 _",
    "i.e. _ the upper limit is about equal to the observed maximal velocity of the fast cs gas ( @xmath0 km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "thus , radiative acceleration is a plausible mechanism for the acceleration of the fast cs gas .",
    "this possibility is enhanced when we note that the effect of the lines may have been underestimated since ( a ) the line list may be incomplete , ( b ) multiple scattering of radiation in the uv line forest has been ignored , and ( c ) the photospheric spectrum is not strictly black - body .",
    "also , as has been shown by lundqvist & fransson ( 1988 ) and fransson et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , the wind conditions can be far from thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "most likely it is ` over - ionised ' which would make the wind behave like a gas which was hotter ( _ cf .",
    "_ fig .  6 ) than the @xmath109  k we have assumed , thereby increasing the radiation force .",
    "the slow - down of the fast cs gas between days 23 and 42 can be naturally explained using eq.([eq : uprec3 ] ) . using information from fassia et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , the ratio @xmath110 decreases by a factor @xmath111 during this period , and unless @xmath75 increases significantly during the same period , the line acceleration shows roughly the right temporal behaviour .",
    "an alternative mechanism for producing pre - shock acceleration is the dynamical effect of the expected relativistic particle shock precursor ( kang & jones 1997 ) .",
    "let a fraction @xmath112 of the kinetic luminosity , @xmath113 , dissipated in the outer shock , be converted into relativistic particles trapped in the shock wave region . in the approximation of constant ejecta velocity , @xmath114 , the energy equation with adiabatic losses",
    "gives as the total energy of relativistic particles @xmath115 ( where @xmath80 is the shock wave radius ) , and the relativistic particle pressure in the precursor @xmath116 ( where @xmath117 is the fraction of relativistic particles in the precursor ) .",
    "the equation of motion of the pre - shock flow with velocity @xmath118 in the shock frame , is @xmath119 , and so we have as the velocity of the pre - shock gas in the lab frame    @xmath120    setting @xmath105 and @xmath103 km s@xmath1 , to obtain a precursor velocity of @xmath121 km s@xmath1 we need @xmath122 .",
    "given comparable fractions of relativistic particle energy in the post - shock and pre - shock regions ( kang & jones 1997 ) , we may adopt @xmath123 .",
    "thus , to accelerate pre - shock matter up to 500 km s@xmath1 , the conversion efficiency of shock energy into relativistic particles must be @xmath124 . while this value is close to the absolute upper limit , it is nevertheless plausible given the high efficiency of particle acceleration in high mach number astrophysical shocks ( blandford 1984 ) .",
    "thus , from energy considerations alone , we can not rule out the possibility that the relativistic particle precursor may significantly contribute to the acceleration of the wind in sn  1998s .",
    "we now consider a radically different mechanism for producing the fast cs gas .",
    "this has already been mentioned in section 2 .",
    "it essentially exploits the possibility that the wind may have a clumpy structure . in this scenario ,",
    "the fast cs gas is identified with radiatively - cooled shocked gas in wind clouds engulfed by the intercloud shock .",
    "this may , in principle , reproduce both the characteristic velocity of the fast cs gas and resolve the photosphere proximity problem . moreover",
    ", it may also produce a negative velocity gradient .",
    "since the postshock density @xmath125 increases from the outer shock jump towards the contact discontinuity ( chevalier 1982 ) , it means that the cloud shock velocity @xmath126 also increases inwardly .",
    "thus , the negative velocity gradient may well be mimicked by the ensemble of cloud shocks .",
    "a specific feature of the proposed mechanism is a ` stripping flow ' produced by the mass loss from the shocked cloud due to a kelvin - helmholtz instability ( klein , mckee & colella 1991 ) .",
    "the stripping flow is characterized by a broad spectrum of fragment sizes and velocities with the smaller fragments acquiring the higher velocities .",
    "tiny , high velocity fragments are subjected to efficient mixing with the hot outer shock gas , which results in their heating and ionisation .",
    "therefore , we expect that the high velocity stripping flow should be revealed particularly by the presence of high ionisation lines .",
    "in fact hst uv spectra do show high velocity ( several @xmath127 km s@xmath1 ) blue wings in c  iv and si  iv resonance lines ( lundqvist et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , and this may well be the consequence of such a stripping flow .",
    "we now test the clumpy wind model against particular observational requirements , particularly on day 23 .",
    "the cloud / intercloud density ratio @xmath128 must be consistent with the cloud shock wave velocity , @xmath129 ( the factor of two is from the factor of four density jump at the intercloud shock ) . with @xmath130 km s@xmath1 and a cds velocity at this epoch of about @xmath131",
    "km s@xmath1 we thus obtain @xmath132 . to meet the requirement of proximity to the photosphere",
    ", the lifetime , @xmath133 , of a cloud of radius @xmath134 must be equal to or greater than the time , @xmath135 , which it takes to cross the intercloud post - shock layer ( @xmath78 is the thickness of this layer ) .",
    "this leads to the constraint @xmath136 .",
    "we consider the case where the ratio is close to this lower limit , _ viz .",
    "_ @xmath137 , in order to maximize the number of shocked clouds and so be consistent with the absence of strong fluctuations in the line profile . combining this ratio with @xmath138 and the value of the photospheric radius at this epoch , @xmath139 cm ( fassia et al . 2000 ) , we get a cloud radius @xmath140 cm .",
    "the filling factor of the clouds ( @xmath74 ) may be estimated from the condition that the covering factor of the shocked clouds is about unity , _ i.e. _ @xmath141 . from this , we obtain @xmath142 . adopting all the cloud parameters derived above , we find that the number of clouds in the outer postshock layer is @xmath143 .",
    "we now demonstrate that , given the above choice of cloud parameters ( @xmath134 , @xmath128 , and @xmath74 ) , the cloud shocks are essentially radiative .",
    "the condition that the cooling time is less than the time for the cloud shock wave propagation is @xmath144 , where @xmath145 is the proton mass , and @xmath146 erg s@xmath1 @xmath147 is the cooling function .",
    "this leads to the requirement @xmath148 @xmath149 , where @xmath150 km s@xmath1 is assumed .",
    "given an average wind density @xmath151 @xmath91 , @xmath152 , and @xmath153 , we obtain a cloud density of @xmath154 @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , from the above lower limit for the cloud column density , @xmath155 , we find that for the cloud shocks to be radiative , @xmath156 cm .",
    "this is consistent with the value @xmath140 cm derived above using the observed values for @xmath157 , @xmath83 and @xmath80 at 23  days .",
    "finally , the adopted set of cloud parameters must be consistent with the day  23 observational upper limit for the net h@xmath6 luminosity @xmath158 erg s@xmath1 ( fassia et al . 2001 ) . to check this",
    ", we use the simple expression for the cumulative h@xmath6 luminosity of the shocked clouds    @xmath159    where @xmath160 is the efficiency of h@xmath6 emission , of the order of @xmath161 ( chevalier & fransson 1994 ) .",
    "substituting in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lum ] ) @xmath162 g cm@xmath1 , @xmath150 km s@xmath1 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 , one obtains @xmath165 erg s@xmath1 , in accord with the observational upper limit .",
    "thus , for the cloud shock scenario an appropriate set of cloud parameters might be @xmath132 , @xmath166 , @xmath167  cm , with the average linear wind density @xmath168 g cm@xmath1 .",
    "note , this model can account for the observed slow down with time of the average cloud shock velocity ( @xmath169 ) , if the density contrast @xmath128 increases with radius between days 23 and 42 and/or @xmath83 decreases with time , both being plausible .",
    "summing up , the above order of magnitude analysis shows that the shocked wind cloud model for the fast cs component may be matched to the bulk of the empirical constraints for a reasonable set of parameters .",
    "while the proposed model is quite crude , it does appear to offer a useful alternative explanation for the fast cs gas phenomenon , including the high velocity blue wings of the fast cs absorption profiles in high ionisation uv lines .",
    "the principal finding of this paper is that the fast cs gas observed in balmer lines in sn  1998s during the era day  2342 has a negative velocity gradient flow confined to a narrow layer above , and attached to , the photosphere .",
    "the same should be true for the fast cs gas observed in he  i ( bowen et al .",
    "2000 , fassia et al 2001 ) and mg  ii 2800   ( bowen et al . 2000 ) .",
    "we argue that the fast cs gas is the result of the acceleration of the slow wind in the immediate vicinity of the sn photosphere , and show that acceleration driven by radiation is a plausible mechanism .",
    "thomson scattering alone , while significant , is insufficient to account for the observed fast cs gas velocity .",
    "however , when we include the additional effects of uv line absorption , we can obtain the observed velocity .",
    "moreover , this is a conservative conclusion given the that the line list may be incomplete , that we ignore multiple scattering in uv line forest , and that time - dependent and non - thermodynamic equilibrium effects are not included .",
    "we also demonstrate that the a relativistic particle precursor is able to accelerate pre - shock matter up to the observed fast cs gas velocity",
    ".    the fast cs gas can also originate in a completely different way ; it could be the result of radiative shocks propagating into dense wind clumps together with the effects of a stripping flow .",
    "the stripping flow aspect of the clumpy wind model predicts the presence of very fast , highly ionised cs gas .",
    "this seems to be supported by the observation of high velocity blue absorption wings ( several @xmath170 km s@xmath1 ) in c  iv and si  iv ( lundqvist et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "an intriguing fact , is that the narrow line width of the unaccelerated wind ( @xmath171 km s@xmath1 ) indicates a rather moderate wind temperature @xmath172 k. this is quite unlike the hot wind ( @xmath173 k ) at early epochs ( @xmath174 month ) anticipated by the model of lundqvist & fransson ( 1988 ) for sn  1979c with comparable wind density , as well as for the somewhat less dense wind around sn  1993j ( fransson et al .",
    "this disagreement may indicate that either the outer shock is essentially radiative so that the comptonization responsible for the bulk of the uv radiation is inefficient , or that the wind is clumpy with a resulting low equilibrium temperature in the pre - shock wind clumps .",
    "we favour the second option , because a radiative outer shock would produce even higher uv luminosity than that of comptonized radiation from an adiabatic shock .",
    "we note that a clumpy - wind scenario was also introduced for sn  1993j by fransson et al .",
    "( 1996 ) to resolve a similar controversy between the theoretical high wind ionisation and a lower ionisation implied by the cs spectral lines .    in fassia et al .",
    "( 2001 ) we suggested that the fast cs gas in sn  1998s resulted from the progenitor going through an rsg phase and then a bsg phase shortly before it exploded .",
    "` mid - csm ' and ` outer - csm ' zones were defined corresponding , respectively , to a tenuous , fast csm wind from the bsg , and a dense , slow csm wind from the rsg wind .",
    "the bsg wind would have ` piled up ' against the inner boundary of the rsg wind , producing a negative velocity gradient .",
    "the sn shock would first engulf the faster more tenuous part of the bsg wind thus accounting for the observed decrease in the absorption blueshift with time .",
    "the abrupt appearance of the strong broad lines by about day  45 would be due to the impact of the ejecta with the denser rsg wind .",
    "thus , qualitatively at least , this model can account for much of the observed spectral behaviour .",
    "however , an important result of the spectral line modelling described in section  2 is that , in terms of the photospheric radius , the radius , @xmath27 , of the interface between the accelerated ( fast ) and unaccelerated ( slow ) wind remains about constant between days  23 and 42 ( table  2 ) . yet , in the rsg / bsg wind explanation , @xmath27 decreases from 2.1 on day  23 to 1.3 on day  42 . but model  4 ( table  1 and fig .",
    "2 ) shows that changing @xmath27 from 1.3 to just 1.5 produces a much poorer reproduction of the observed profiles .",
    "this appears to present a difficulty for the bsg / rsg wind scenario .",
    "moreover , the acceleration model can also account for the sudden appearance of the strong , broad lines simply as a result of the cds becoming optically thin around this epoch ( chugai 2001 ) .",
    "in other words , there may not be a need for a division of the wind into ` mid - csm ' and ` outer - csm ' components .",
    "all this leads us to favour the proposition that the fast cs gas is not a pre - existing flow , but instead is created by the ongoing acceleration of the slow wind in the immediate vicinity of the photosphere .",
    "the question of whether or not the bsg / rsg explanation can survive quantitative modelling is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "it is instructive to review briefly the other known cases of type  iin and type  iil supernovae which have high velocity cs spectral features .",
    "the first observational evidence for a phenomenon of this kind was provided by the iue spectra of the type  iil sn  1979c .",
    "this revealed uv lines of c  iv and si  iv indicating a gas velocity in the range @xmath175 km s@xmath1 ( panagia et al .",
    "bearing in mind the photometric and spectral similarities between sn  1998s and sn  1979c , the fast ( cs ) material in sn  1979c may also be associated with shocked wind clumps .",
    "originally , the uv lines in sn  1979c were attributed to pre - shock radiative acceleration of the slow wind ( chevalier 1981 ) , or to emission from x - ray heated ejecta ( fransson 1984 ) .",
    "another case is the type  iib sn  1993j where h@xmath6 p  cygni profiles suggested a gas velocity of @xmath176 km s@xmath1 at 23 days post - explosion ( cumming et al .",
    "a similar velocity was indicated by the n  v  1240   emission line ( sonneborn et al .",
    "fransson et al .",
    "( 1996 ) suggested radiative acceleration of the slow wind as a mechanism for the origin of this fast cs gas , but noted that thomson scattering could be insufficient .",
    "it would be interesting to determine whether or not line absorption radiation pressure could provide the required enhancement of the radiative force in this case . or do we need alternative mechanisms such as a cosmic ray precursor or shocked wind clouds ?    in the type  iin sn  1984e , spectral features are attributed to a superwind .",
    "velocities of @xmath177 km s@xmath1 are indicated by the emission components of balmer lines , while the blue edge of the h@xmath6 absorption indicates a velocity as high as 3000 km s@xmath1 ( dopita et al .",
    "1984 ) , i.e. substantially higher than in the case of sn  1998s .",
    "the low signal - to - noise ratio of the sn  1984e data leaves some doubts about the precise interpretation of the line profile ; in any event a velocity of 3000 km s@xmath1 at the observed epochs is probably beyond the capability of radiative acceleration .",
    "the type  iin sn  1994w exhibited p  cygni lines which indicated cs gas velocities of @xmath178 km s@xmath1 . at first sight , therefore , we might take this sn to be similar to sn  1998s .",
    "however , the amazing persistence of the absorption line velocities for about two months ( sollerman , cumming & lundqvist 1998 ) is quite unlike the velocity evolution observed in the fast cs gas features of sn  1998s . a pre - existing cs shell ( wind ) with a constant velocity of @xmath179 km",
    "s@xmath1 is the more likely explanation for the fast cs gas around sn  1994w ( sollerman et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "it may well be that in different sne  iin we see two kinds of fast cs matter .",
    "one type is the result of acceleration of the slow progenitor wind at the ejecta - wind interface ( e.g. sn  1998s ) , while the other type is produced by the progenitor before it explodes ( e.g. sn  1994w ) .",
    "the origin of such different modes of heavy mass loss in the final stages of a star s life remains quite uncertain , with the conceivable involvement of stars from both the low mass ( @xmath180  m@xmath181 ) and high mass ( @xmath182  m@xmath181 ) ends of the massive star range . by studying a sufficiently large sample of sne  iin using high - resolution spectroscopy together with other observations in the x - ray , optical and radio bands",
