    "massive stars ( @xmath4 25 m ) may not always launch successful neutrino - driven explosions @xcite . we describe here the continued evolution of such stars after their cores collapse to black holes and accrete the surrounding stellar mantle . for the most massive stars ( m@xmath5 @xmath6 35 m ) with sufficient angular momentum , a collapsar  a rapidly accreting ( @xmath7 0.1 m@xmath8 ) stellar mass black hole  forms promptly at the center of a collapsing star @xcite .",
    "we refer to these as type - i collapsars .",
    "less rapidly accreting black holes can also form over longer time periods due to the fallback of stellar material which failed to escape during the initial supernova explosions ( type ii collapsars ) .",
    "this probably happens for main sequence masses , @xmath9 20 m. stars with masses below this explode as normal supernovae and leave behind neutron star remnants .",
    "collapsars power jetted explosions by tapping a fraction of the binding energy released by the accreting star through magnetohydrodynamical processes or neutrino annihilation , or possibly by extracting some of the black hole spin energy .",
    "the vast majority of stellar explosions do not make collapsars , only those which make black holes and have sufficient angular momentum .",
    "further , not all collapsars make grbs .",
    "only those which happen in sufficiently small ( in radius ) stars and manage to accelerate a fraction of the explosion energy to sufficiently high lorentz factor .",
    "other collapsar explosions may be responsible for hyper - energetic and asymmetric supernovae like sn1998bw .",
    "table 1 shows a range of observable phenomena possible from collapsars in various kinds of stars .",
    "prompt and delayed black hole formation can occur in massive stars with a range of radii depending on the evolutionary state of the star , its metallicity and its membership in a binary system .",
    "the key difference between the scenarios is the ratio of the time the engine operates , @xmath10 , to the time the explosion takes to break out of the surface of the star , @xmath11 .",
    "the breakout time is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the propagation velocity through the star of the explosion shock or jet head .",
    "typical velocities are 50,000 km s@xmath8 @xcite . if the engine operates for a sufficiently long time to continuously power the jet at its base after the explosion shock ( the jet head ) breaks out of the surface of the star , then highly relativistic outflow can be achieved for a fraction of the ejecta and a classical grb can result .",
    "the column of stellar material pushed ahead of the jet , perhaps a few .01 m , escapes the star and expands sideways leaving a decreasing amount of material ahead of the jet .",
    ".observable phenomena resulting from collapsars .",
    "[ cols=\">,^,^ \" , ]",
    "relativistic outflow can be achieved from an accreting black hole surrounded by a collapsing stellar mantle .",
    "the key is the prolonged deposition of energy into regions of the star which can expand due to their overpressure .",
    "a single impulsive release of energy @xmath14 will explode a star if the energy input exceeds the binding energy .",
    "but the explosion will be `` baryon loaded '' , a `` dirty fireball '' i.e. a supernova .",
    "the maximum lorentz factor will be @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the mass of baryons in the region where the energy is deposited .",
    "the lorentz factor will be less than the asymptotic limit because the expanding fireball will do work in accelerating the surrounding material .",
    "_ for an impulsive energy deposition , _ a clean environment with @xmath17 and @xmath18 is necessary to make a classical grb or else the deposited energy will be shared with too many baryons ( the `` baryon pollution '' problem ) .",
    "the situation is different if the energy is deposited over a period long compared to the expansion time of the energy loading region . in this case",
    ", energy is injected into a region already expanding due to the previously deposited energy and the corresponding overpressure .",
    "initially , @xmath19 and the expansion is sub - relativistic but as the gas expands the baryon density in the deposition region decreases and the energy per baryon increases ( assuming constant energy deposition rate per unit volume ) .",
    "the expanding gas must do work in accelerating its surroundings so the deposited energy is shared with many baryons and extremely relativistic motion is initially impossible .",
    "baryons can be mixed into the deposition region but centrifugal force and pressure gradients directed away from the pole can inhibit this ( fig . 1 , left panel ) .",
    "the amount of baryons which mix into the deposition region is important for determining the ultimate lorentz factor that can be achieved .",
    "current two - dimensional relativistic calculations for one particular model achieve @xmath20 near the deposition region @xcite and it is expected that higher @xmath21 will result when the calculation is run longer or with greater and/or variable energy deposition .",
    "detailed calculations are possible and will be performed soon . at late times after the baryons initially present in the deposition region have expanded away , the lorentz factor depends on the energy flux and mass flux into the deposition region as @xmath22 .",
    "the mass flux depends on the rate that hydrodynamical instabilities mix baryons into the deposition region and the rate at which the engine injects baryons .    in the collapsar model for grbs , or any other similar model involving a massive star , the key to obtaining relativistic motion is the escape of an energy loaded bubble from its surroundings ( the stellar mantle ) . in the case of the toroidal density distribution as in the collapsar @xcite ,",
    "a low density channel is left behind by regions of the star along the rotational axis which lacked centrifugal support and fell into the black hole .",
    "recent simulations @xcite have shown that energy deposition leads to expansion of gas along the pole , a jet .",
    "the key to achieving high @xmath21 is for energy deposition to continue at the base of the jet even after the jet head has broken out of the surface of the star and begun free expansion into the low density circumstellar environment .",
    "subsequent energy deposition at the base of the jet continues to load energy into an increasingly baryon - free region with the expanding gas continuously channelled along the rotation axis of the star ."
