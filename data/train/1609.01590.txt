    "the resulting dynamics is described by a cp - map corresponding to a generalized amplitude damping ( gad ) channel , providing a suitable form for the simulation of the non - equilibrium dynamic processes , and the thermalisation of the probe .",

    "as the transformation performed by the channel is : @xmath70 , a satisfactory control of the bath temperature and interaction time theoretical parameters can be realized via the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath14 .",

    "the input @xmath78 is first split on the pbs0 , coupling the polarisation to the arm within the sagnac : @xmath79 , where @xmath80 @xmath81 indicates the ( counter-)clockwise direction in the interferometer .    to reproduce one pair of the gad kraus operators , the slm has been used to implement the unitary transformation @xmath82 on the @xmath80 mode , and @xmath83 \\vert h \\rangle \\langle h \\vert + \\exp[-i\\frac{\\phi}{2 } ] \\vert v \\rangle \\langle v \\vert$ ] for the @xmath84 mode , where @xmath36 represents the birefringent phase imparted by the slm .",

    "<S> introduction . </S>",
    "<S> _ thermodynamics provides a description of open systems in terms of the exchange of energy , be it in the form of either heat or work . </S>",
    "<S> although it was developed first in order to give an account of such systems once they have reached the equilibrium with the surrounding environment , it has recently been the object of extensions for treating transient behaviours , irreversibility , and non - equilibrium quantum processes . </S>",
    "<S> the knowledge gained through such exertion ranges from fundamental @xcite , to more technological issues related to non - equilibrium quantum heat machines @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> within such a context , the simplest example considers a single - particle system in contact with a thermal bath ; the thermodynamic limit can still be taken , by considering a large collection of identical replicas  @xcite . by isolating a single constituent , the need of accounting for inter - constituent interactions </S>",
    "<S> is avoided , and the problem greatly simplified . </S>",
    "<S> the attention is then entirely devoted to the internal energy levels of this one constituent , and , if this is a quantum particle , to the coherence among them . </S>",
    "<S> since the presence of quantum coherence underlies the existence of distinctively quantum states , viz . the class of entangled states , it is natural to consider coherence itself as a resource , with appropriate tools for assessing and quantifying its presence  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> these considerations find an immediate application in the context of thermometry , since , on the one hand , we assist at the interaction for a given time of a probe with the monitored system , while , on the other , the probe itself needs being prepared in an informative , hence resourceful , state  @xcite . in  @xcite , jevtic _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ have discussed the implementation of an elementary thermometer with a single qubit : the task is not the estimation of arbitrary temperatures , but the discrimination between two thermal baths at different temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> notably , they have found that limiting the interaction time between the qubit and either bath , thus avoiding thermalisation , result in an improved discrimination . </S>",
    "<S> this investigation opens perspectives for realizing temperature measurements at the nanoscale , when the thermometer needs being even smaller than a nano - size thermal bath , e.g. a nanomechanical device  @xcite or atomic condensates  @xcite .    here </S>",
    "<S> we present an experimental investigation of the results of jevtic _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ with a linear - optical simulator . </S>",
    "<S> we show how one can determine an observable able to discriminate optimally between the two baths , and how the coherence between the two energy level of the qubit influence the performance of the thermometer . </S>",
    "<S> coherence does play a role in the discrimination , but its role is not as simple as a mere enhancement ; instead , it affects the time scale at which thermalisation occurs . </S>",
    "<S> these features are well captured by the change of the helmholtz free energy of the probe . </S>",

    "<S> finally , the qubit is removed from the interaction after a time @xmath7 , and measured to infer the working temperature . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the interaction of the qubit with a thermal bath , modelled as a gas of non - interacting bosons , results in either of two processes : @xmath8 ) the qubit decays to the ground state transfering its energy to the thermal bath ; @xmath9 ) the qubit absorbs an excitation from the reservoir , hence hopping incoherently to the excited state . </S>",
    "<S> the rate of the two processes is dictated by the temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> since we are approaching thermodynamics as a theory describing state transformations in the presence of a thermal bath , we introduce a phenomenological model for this interaction as a generalized amplitude damping ( gad ) channel @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding map utilizes two couples of kraus operators . </S>",

    "<S> the gad channel is characterized by two parameters : @xmath14 , which represents the decay rate for both the processes and @xmath15 which is the occurrence probability of the first couple of kraus operators ; @xmath16 is the probability for the other couple . </S>",
    "<S> these two parameters are linked to the exact solution of the problem , given by the full lindblad treatment : @xmath17 and @xmath18 $ ] where @xmath19 is the average number of excitations in the bath , and @xmath7 is the ( dimensionless ) interaction time as described in @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> indeed , this takes advantage from the fact that photons are non - interacting particles ; using classical light provides a convenient way to obtain a large number of independent replicas . in this work , we adopt this approach for the simulation of an open system , where the qubit is coded in the polarisation , and the coupling to the reservoir occurs via the spatial mode @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> our experimental setup , shown in fig.[setupthermo ] , consists of a displaced sagnac interferometer where one of the mirrors is replaced by a spatial light modulator ( slm ) . </S>",
    "<S> by convention , we set the ground ( excited ) state @xmath4 ( @xmath3 ) to be the vertical @xmath40 ( horizontal @xmath41 ) polarisation state . </S>",
    "<S> we initialize the input as a linear polarisation , than send it to the interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> the beam is then divided in two using a polarising beam splitter ( pbs0 ) whose outputs constitute the two arms of the sagnac interferometer . </S>",

    "<S> we reconstruct the density matrix for the qubit after its interaction with the reservoir in the following way : first , we set the interferometer in order to implement the @xmath37 transformation , and perform polarisation tomography  @xcite , without distinguishing the outputs of the interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> we repeat the same operation , using the second setting @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the two experimentally reconstructed matrices are then summed with the opportune weighting @xmath15 , @xmath16 to obtain the state after the complete interaction  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the maximal separation occurs at short times , well before the qubit has reached full thermalisation with the reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> these three states are associated to three different strategies : @xmath47 corresponds to the ground state of the qubit , hence we simulate the standard procedure of heating the thermometer ; @xmath45 corresponds to the excited state , hence we simulate the cooling of the thermometer ; finally , @xmath48 is a coherent strategy , based on the superposition of a hot and a cold thermometer . as expected , in the steady - state regime , the use of any of the three state is equivalent , as thermalisation erases any information on the initial state . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the presence of the coherence does not help either in implementing a more effective thermometer , since the optimal separation between @xmath49 $ ] and @xmath50 $ ] weakly depends on the input , nor a faster thermometer , as the optimal measurement time occurs at shorter times for the ground state @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> the main advantage of using the state @xmath48 is in the possibility of maintaining a satisfactory discrimination ability for longer times , as shown by the width of the separation between the two curves ; in practical applications , this eases the requirements on the controlled interaction between the qubit and the reservoir </S>",

    "<S> it can be shown that the von neumann entropy of the system increases monotonically , a signature of markovian dynamic @xcite ; such a unidirectional information flow between the system and the thermal bath results in a decrease in the helmholtz free energy , as expected for spontaneous transformations . </S>",
