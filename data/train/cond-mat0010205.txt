    "total - energy calculations are an important tool in theoretical condensed - matter physics , giving insight into structures and mechanical properties of solids  @xcite .",
    "accurate calculations of total energy are notoriously difficult , however .",
    "theoretically , one must solve the schrdinger equation simultaneously for all electrons in the presence of fixed atomic nuclei . density - functional theory ( dft )",
    "@xcite simplifies this problem by reducing it to the self - consistent solution of schrdinger s equation for a single electron in a potential that depends upon the electron density .",
    "even with this simplification , full _ ab - initio _ dft electronic - structure methods are computationally demanding  @xcite , usually limited to systems of less than a hundred atoms , and may not yield immediate physical insight once an answer is obtained .",
    "instead , one may expand the total energy in terms of pair and many - body interatomic potentials @xcite , so that the total energy appears as an explicit function of atomic separations . depending on the physical system under study and the type of information sought",
    ", the expansion may often be truncated after a small number of terms .",
    "such a truncated expansion trades off a degree of accuracy in favor of computational simplicity and potentially greater physical insight as compared with a full _ ab - initio _ electronic - structure approach .    many metallic systems been studied using such quantum - based interatomic potentials , including aluminum and its alloys with both transition and non - transition metals @xcite .",
    "these potentials are especially simple in the case of non - transition metals . there",
    ", the @xmath1-electron energy bands are either empty or else are completely filled and deeply buried below the fermi energy level , allowing rapidly convergent expansions of the total energy and an accurate description in terms of only radial - force interactions  @xcite .",
    "the presence of partially filled @xmath1-bands at or near the fermi level in transition metals complicates the analysis .",
    "the occupied @xmath1-band electronic states are highly localized in the vicinity of the atoms , leading to directional or covalent bonding with a strong angular dependence .",
    "consequently , total - energy expansions will not converge as quickly as for non - transitions metals , and three- and higher - body angular - force interactions may contribute significantly @xcite .",
    "moriarty  @xcite has developed a rigorous dft treatment of interatomic potentials for transition metals ( tms ) in the context of the generalized pseudopotential theory ( gpt ) .",
    "the treatment was later extended to binary and ternary alloys of aluminum with first row transition metals  @xcite .",
    "these studies found that three- and four - body interactions could be important in determining thermodynamic and mechanical stability of structures with large tm concentrations .",
    "the explicit treatment of @xmath1-electron interactions in the gpt produces a strong attractive interaction at unphysically short distances in the pair potentials , which is balanced by repulsive forces contained in the many - body interactions . for specific structural environments , however , it is possible to directly modify the short - ranged part of the tm - tm pair potentials to remove this unphysical attraction , so that a truncation of the total energy expansion at the level of pair potentials will be more accurate when transition metal atoms are near neighbors . here",
    "we wish to consider the construction of such effective pair potentials for important transition - metal aluminide systems .",
    "one motivation for this study is the need for fast total - energy calculations in al - tm systems with short tm - tm separations to enable structural relaxation , and more generally , molecular - dynamics and monte - carlo simulations .",
    "we focus our attention on al - co - ni compounds in decagonal quasicrystalline structures  @xcite .",
    "the precise modifications required in the co - co , co - ni , and ni - ni pair potentials depend on the particular structure studied , but they should be at least approximately valid for many similar structures . furthermore , the modifications obtained may allow us to treat al - co - cu and al - cu - ni decagonal phases  @xcite because the cu - cu interactions do not appear to require modification  @xcite .",
    "limited numbers of _ ab - initio _ electronic - structure calculations , which effectively sum the pair and many - body total - energy contributions , are sufficient to determine the required modifications , and this is the strategy that we follow here .",
    "we intend to apply these potentials to predict the structures of decagonal quasicrystals  @xcite .",
    "a great deal of experimental data is available that identifies the positions of most atoms and identifies the chemical identity of many of those .",
    "however , in order to determine the quasicrystal structures from x - ray diffraction , one faces degenerate structures because elements near each other in a row of the periodic table ( such as co , ni and cu ) have similar x - ray form factors . a common approach to this problem is to supplement the experimental data with total - energy calculations .",
    "this approach is well established in crystallography  @xcite .",
    "the effective pair potentials developed here can be applied to total energy calculations in quasicrystals and related structures with a great reduction in computational times compared with the _ ab initio _ electronic - structure calculations themselves .",
    "the time savings results from two general features of the potentials .",
    "first , for a given atomic volume and composition the potentials may be precalculated and then applied repeatedly with a simple lookup and interpolation .",
    "second , to calculate the change in energy when a single atom is moved , only interactions affecting that atom are needed .",
    "if the interactions are cut off at a finite spatial separation , the time required to calculate the change in total energy becomes independent of the number of atoms in the complete structure .",
    "this is so - called order-@xmath2 scaling .",
    "in contrast , _ ab - initio _ electronic - structure methods must recalculate the entire system when a single atom is moved , typically resulting in order-@xmath3 scaling .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : problem ] , gpt interatomic potentials are briefly reviewed and the issues surrounding the truncation of the total energy expansion at the pair - potential level in al - tm systems are discussed .",
    "section  [ sec : mod ] gives details about the scheme we employ to determine the needed modifications to the tm - tm pair potentials .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we discuss the results of our full _ ab - initio _ electronic - structure calculations and the modified tm - tm pair potentials developed using them .",
    "the generalized pseudopotential theory starts with a full _ ab - initio _ dft representation of the total energy in the standard local - density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "the usual small - core approximation is used to separate the treatment of valence and core electrons and the electron - ion interaction for the valence electrons is handled by means of optimized nonlocal pseudopotentials .",
    "a mixed valence - wavefunction basis is employed allowing @xmath4 states to be represented as superpositions of plane waves , while @xmath1 states are represented in terms of localized , atomic - like @xmath1 states .",
    "the electron density and total energy are systematically expanded in terms of the resulting weak matrix elements in this basis : @xmath4 pseudopotential matrix elements @xmath5 , @xmath4-@xmath1 hybridization matrix elements @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and @xmath1-@xmath1 tight - binding - like matrix elements @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in real space",
    ", the total energy may be cast in terms of well - defined interatomic potentials , which can be calculated as functionals of these matrix elements . for a general multicomponent alloy ,",
    "the gpt total - energy expansion takes the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the set of all positions of @xmath2 ions in the metal , @xmath12 is a volume term that includes all collective and one - ion contributions that are independent of structure , and @xmath13 , @xmath14 are the two- , three- , and higher many - ion interatomic potentials .",
    "the primes on sums over ion positions exclude all self - interaction terms .",
    "indices @xmath15 run over all chemical species , and indices @xmath16 run over the individual ion positions . the volume term and all of the interatomic potentials depend on the atomic volume @xmath17 and a composition vector @xmath18 , but are independent of structure .",
    "the potentials are functions of the relative positions of small subsets of atoms , independent of the positions of all other atoms in the system .",
    "the entire dependence on the structure comes analytically through the summations over ion positions .",
    "this makes these potentials transferable among different structures at fixed atomic volume and composition .",
    "the full details of the first - principles gpt for transition - metal systems are given in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "a simplified model version of the theory has also been developed  @xcite , using canonical @xmath1-bands to obtain analytic representations of the multi - ion potentials .",
    "in general , the separation of the total energy into two- and higher - body terms is not entirely unique , since one can always add contributions to the pair potential @xmath13 provided one makes suitable subtractions from @xmath19 and/or higher - body potentials . within the gpt ,",
    "the uniqueness of the potentials is established by ensuring that their desired properties of structure independence and full transferability are consistent with the matrix elements that define them . in this regard",
    ", the total energy is normally calculated to second order in the pseudopotential @xmath5 , so that @xmath4 contributions enter only in the volume term and the pair potentials .",
    "the tm @xmath1-@xmath1 and @xmath4-@xmath1 contributions to each potential , on the other hand , are carried to all orders in the matrix elements @xmath8 , etc .",
    "terms are allocated to pair- and many - body potentials according to how many distinct ionic positions explicitly enter .",
    "thus , for example , the tm pair potentials @xmath20 contain contributions that are even powers of @xmath8 associated with repeated hopping of @xmath1 electrons back and forth between a pair of ions , with the leading term proportional to @xmath21 .",
    "the three - ion tm potentials contain corresponding terms of third order proportional to @xmath22 and terms of fourth order proportional to @xmath23 , as well as higher - order terms .",
    "the four - ion tm potentials start at fourth order in @xmath8 .",
    "the tight - binding - like @xmath1-@xmath1 contributions to the tm potentials are modulated by @xmath4-@xmath1 hybridization , @xmath1-state nonorthogonality , and other factors such as @xmath1-band filling , but nonetheless , they give valuable insight into the expected short - range behavior of the potentials .",
    "in particular , one expects a strong attractive contribution to @xmath20 at short distances resulting from the second - order term in @xmath8 .",
    "this term is attractive because it directly relates to the second moment of the @xmath1-band density of states and hence to the @xmath1-band width and the additional cohesion provided by partial @xmath1-band filling .",
    "the attraction is strong at short distances because the matrix element for atoms separated by distance @xmath24 varies roughly as @xmath25 , the behavior obtained for pure canonical @xmath1 bands . in addition",
    ", one expects this attractive contribution to be maximum near half - filling of the @xmath1 bands and to vanish for completely filled or empty @xmath1 bands .",
    "thus the expected overbinding in @xmath20 will show a clear chemical dependence , with decreasing magnitudes for co - co , co - ni , and ni - ni interactions .    for short - range tm interactions , repulsive contributions from higher - order terms in @xmath8 will balance the attractive contribution of the second - order term in @xmath20 , provided that the local concentration of tm atoms is sufficiently high .",
    "in general , the detailed balance obtained involves the three- , four- , and possibly higher - ion potentials . near half - filling of the @xmath1 bands ,",
    "however , the repulsive contributions will be dominated by the fourth - order terms in @xmath26 .",
    "this in turn suggests a simple scheme to modify the tm pair potentials at short range to incorporate the balance directly , a scheme that we will develop in sec .  [",
    "sec : mod ] .",
    "first , however , we examine the actual calculated gpt pair potentials for the al - co - ni system of interest here .",
    "figure  [ fig : alal ] shows the al - al and al - tm pair potentials for al - co - ni  @xcite .",
    "these are calculated in the aluminum - rich limit , but in practice they do not depend strongly on composition .",
    "the first minima of the al - tm pair potentials occur near 2.3    with depths of about 0.2 ev ( al - ni ) and 0.3 ev ( al - co ) . rather than a potential minimum ,",
    "the al - al potential exhibits a shoulder near 3   .",
    "the tm - tm pair potentials are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tmtm ] . as expected , the tm overbinding is most evident for co. the first minimum in the co - co potential has a depth of 2.1 ev at 1.7   .",
    "the corresponding ni - ni potential depth of 0.1 ev at 2.2     is not obviously problematic , but in the following we will find it requires some modification . in the present applications ,",
    "the co - ni pair potential @xmath27 is defined as an average of the co - co and ni - ni potentials , @xmath28 this amounts to a perturbative expansion of @xmath29 in the difference in atomic number @xmath30 . clearly , @xmath27 so - defined suffers overbinding due to the overbinding of @xmath31 .",
    "we wish to devise effective pair potentials for al - co - cu and al - cu - ni as well as al - co - ni .",
    "previously , the al - cu potentials were found to be well behaved up to large cu composition  @xcite , so no modification of @xmath32 is suggested .",
    "our modification to @xmath31 obtained for al - co - ni compounds may be approximately valid for these other compounds .",
    "we previously defined @xcite @xmath33 as equal to @xmath34 because ni lies between co and cu in the periodic table .",
    "thus our modified ni - ni potential should serve as an approximate modified co - cu potential .",
    "for the modified cu - ni potential we may take @xmath35 , using the modified ni - ni potential .",
    "the al - co - cu and al - co - ni potentials so - obtained will , of course , still need to be validated using full _ ab - initio _ calculations .",
    "as discussed above , the short - ranged attraction in the tm - tm pair potentials is balanced by repulsive terms contained in the three- and higher - body potentials .",
    "if one chooses to truncate the gpt expansion at the pair potential level , these repulsive many - body contributions must be `` folded '' into effective pair potentials .",
    "formally , one may define an effective pair potential by averaging over atomic positions , holding a single pair of ions fixed : @xmath36 such potentials have been previously considered in the context of the simplified model gpt  @xcite and canonical @xmath1 bands for central transition metals .",
    "there it was found that the four - body interaction oscillates with respect to angles between atoms , with a nearly zero mean , so it does not contribute significantly to @xmath37 . the third - order contribution to @xmath38 also",
    "approximately averages away , but the fourth - order contribution to @xmath38 contributes strongly , yielding a short - ranged repulsive term proportional to @xmath39 balancing against the attractive second - order term in @xmath40 .    inspired by the short - ranged repulsion found in eq .",
    "( [ veff ] ) and the power law variation of @xmath8 within the model gpt  @xcite , we propose to modify the full gpt pair potentials @xmath29 by adding terms of the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are positive and depend upon the elements @xmath44 and @xmath45 of the pair potential modified .",
    "our expectation , which is confirmed below , is that @xmath43 is large in all cases , so that @xmath46 is indeed short - ranged . in our applications , the quantity @xmath47 is taken as a common atomic separation in quasicrystals of 2.55  . then at a fixed atomic volume and composition",
    "the effective pair potential can be written as @xmath48 we determine the unknowns @xmath42 and @xmath43 by matching energies and forces obtained from full _ ab initio _ electronic - structure calculations on a quasicrystal approximant .",
    "cockayne and widom @xcite previously suggested a structure for decagonal al - co - cu .",
    "an approximant of that structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : str ] with ni atoms replacing cu . the orthorhombic unit cell ( a=23.3   , b=7.57   , c=4.09   ) contains 50 atoms ( al@xmath49co@xmath50ni@xmath51 ) .",
    "most atoms occupy either z=0.25 or z=0.75 layers .",
    "al atoms at the centers of hexagons occupy the z=0.5 layer .",
    "two co atoms occupy symmetric positions around these central al atoms . in al - co - cu ,",
    "alternation of co and cu on tile edges is thought to be energetically advantageous  @xcite .",

    "atoms b and c occupy nearly equivalent sites .",
    "an exact symmetry in the al atom positions guarantees that no bond involving an al atom is affected by the swap .",
    "we already noted the change in tm near - neighbor interactions . at further neighbors , with separations of 4.6     or greater",
    ", we also find interchanges between co - co and ni - ni bonds for pairs of co - ni bonds .",
    "if the approximate form  ( [ vconi ] ) of @xmath27 as the average of @xmath31 and @xmath34 were valid , all changes in bonding would exactly cancel each other , resulting in a vanishing energy change .",
    "we presume that approximation  ( [ vconi ] ) is more accurate at large separations than small separations .",
