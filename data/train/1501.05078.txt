    "wilson s renormalization group @xcite is an essential and pedagogical tool in modern theoretical physics .",
    "once a renormalization - group flow in a parameter space is given , one can read off relevant degrees of freedom at each step of coarse graining through change of parameters , and understand the phase structure in principle .",
    "therefore , a renormalization - group flow gives us a quantitative and qualitative picture of a system concerned .",
    "the aim of this paper is to define a renormalization procedure and derive the corresponding flow equation for random tensor networks , in particular for those proposed as feynman - graph expressions @xcite , through the use of the canonical tensor model ( ctm , for short ) .",
    "first of all , ctm has been introduced by one of the authors as a model of quantum gravity by considering space - time as a dynamical fuzzy space @xcite .",
    "ctm is a tensor model in the canonical formalism , which has a canonical conjugate pair of rank - three tensors , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , as dynamical variables .",
    "this interpretation of tensorial variables in terms of a fuzzy space is different from the one made by original tensor models .",
    "historically , tensor models have been introduced as models of simplicial quantum gravity in dimensions higher than two @xcite ; although the original tensor models have some drawbacks , tensor models as simplicial quantum gravity are currently in progress as colored tensor models @xcite ( see @xcite-@xcite for recent developments . ) . in ctm ,",
    "@xmath4 , the cardinality of the rank - three tensors , may be interpreted as the number of  points \" forming a space , while physical properties of space - time such as dimensions , locality , etc .",
    "must emerge from the collective dynamics of these  points .",
    "\" so far , the physics of the small-@xmath4 ctm is relatively well understood : the classical dynamics of the @xmath5 ctm agrees with the minisuperspace approximation of general relativity in arbitrary dimensions @xcite ; the exact physical states have been obtained for @xmath0 in the full theory @xcite and for @xmath6 in an @xmath7-symmetric subsector @xcite ; intriguingly , physical - state wavefunctions , at least for @xmath8 , have singularities where symmetries are enhanced @xcite . however , similar brute - force analysis as above for @xmath9 seems technically difficult because of the huge number of degrees of freedom of the tensorial variables , although in order to capture , for instance , emergence of space - time from ctm , the large-@xmath4 dynamics is supposed to be important .",
    "thus , for the purpose of handling large-@xmath4 behaviors of ctm , the present authors have proposed the conjecture that statistical systems on random networks @xcite , or _ random tensor networks _ , are intimately related to ctm @xcite : the phase structure of random tensor networks is equivalent to what is implied by considering the hamiltonian vector flow of ctm as the renormalization - group flow of random tensor networks .",
    "this conjecture has been checked qualitatively for @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "in fact , as more or less desired , random tensor networks turn out to be useful to find physical states of ctm with arbitrary @xmath4 : some series of exact physical states for arbitrary @xmath4 have been found as integral expressions based on random tensor networks @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we prove the fundamental aspect of the above conjecture : we show that the hamiltonian vector flow of ctm can be regarded as a renormalization - group flow of random tensor networks for general @xmath4 . here",
    "the key ingredient is that the lagrange multipliers of the hamiltonian vector flow are determined by the dynamics of random tensor networks in the manner given in this paper .",
    "this is in contrast with the previous treatment for @xmath0 , in which the lagrange multipliers are given by a  reasonable \" choice @xcite .",

    "we argue our previous proposal @xcite on the relation between ctm and random tensor networks , and its potential problems . in section  [ sec :",
    "renorm ] , we propose a renormalization procedure for random tensor networks based on ctm , and derive the corresponding renormalization - group flow . in section",
    "[ sec : comp ] , we compare our new and previous proposals with the actual phase structures of random tensor networks for @xmath8 .",
    "we find that the new proposal is consistent with the phase structures , while the previous one is not . in section  [ sec : fixed ] , we discuss the asymptotic behavior of the renormalization - group flow , and clarify the physical meaning of the renormalization parameter . in section  [ sec : theorem ] , we provide a general theorem which relates discontinuity of the renormalization - group flow and the phase transitions of the random tensor networks .",

    "in this paper , we consider a statistical system @xcite parameterized by a real symmetric three - index tensor @xmath10 .",
    "for later convenience , instead of @xmath11 used in the previous papers @xcite . ] its partition function is defined by are taken differently from those in the previous papers @xcite .",
    "this does not change the physical properties of the statistical system . ]",
    "@xmath12 where we have used the following short - hand notations , @xmath13    by using the wick theorem , the gaussian integration of @xmath14 in can be evaluated by the summation over the pairwise contractions of all the @xmath14 s in @xmath15 .",
    "then the partition function can graphically be represented by the summation over all the possible closed networks of @xmath16 trivalent vertices . in each of such networks ,",
    "every vertex is weighted by @xmath2 , and the indices are contracted according to the connection of the network , as in fig.[fig : network ] . therefore , since the pairwise contractions are taken over all the possible ways , the statistical system represented by can be regarded as random tensor networks of @xmath16 trivalent vertices . in general , such a network may contain disconnected sub - networks , but this probability vanishes in the thermodynamic limit @xmath17 . given by a formal sum of over @xmath16 with @xmath16-dependent weights , and comparing explicitly the perturbative expansions in @xmath18 of @xmath19 and those of @xmath20 for @xmath5 .",

    "the partition function is obviously invariant under the orthogonal transformation @xmath29 , which acts on @xmath18 as @xmath30 since the transformation can be absorbed by the redefinition @xmath31 .",
    "in addition , the overall scale transformation of @xmath18 , @xmath32 with an arbitrary real number @xmath33 , does not change the properties of the statistical system , since this merely changes the overall factor of .",
    "for example , for @xmath0 , these invariances allow one to consider a gauge , @xmath34 with real @xmath35 .",
    "the free energy per vertex in the thermodynamic limit can be defined by @xmath36 where we have considered only even numbers of vertices , since an odd number of trivalent vertices can not form a closed network .",
    "the phase structure of the statistical system can be investigated by studying the behavior of the free energy . for the case of @xmath0 ,",
    "the phase transition lines of the free energy in the gauge are shown by solid lines in fig.[fig : rgflow ] @xcite .     and",
    "@xmath37 of the gauge , respectively .",
    "the solid lines describe the phase transition lines of the random tensor networks with @xmath0 , which can exactly be obtained in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "the arrows describe the hamilton vector flow of ctm with @xmath38.,width=264 ]    the transitions are first order , except at the curie point , @xmath39 , where the first derivatives of @xmath40 are continuous , but the second ones are not @xcite .",
    "in fact , for arbitrary @xmath4 , the free energy can exactly be obtained by applying the laplace method to evaluate @xcite .",
    "the result is is symmetric under part of the @xmath41 transformation , the perturbations of the integrand of around @xmath42 contain some zero modes , and the application of the laplace method will require extra treatment to integrate over the symmetric directions .",
    "however , this integration is obviously finite , and will only generate corrections of the free energy higher in @xmath43 , which do not affect the thermodynamic limit .",
    "thus , the exact free energy in the thermodynamic limit is given by for the whole region of @xmath18 including symmetric points .",
    "note that this argument may change , if one takes a double scaling limit accompanied with @xmath44 , which , however , is not considered in this paper . ]",

    "this is surprising , since ctm was proposed aiming for quantum gravity , and there exist no apparent reasons for ctm to be related to statistical systems on random networks .",

    "then , the hamiltonian vector flow is given by @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a fictitious parameter along the flow .",
    "in the previous paper @xcite , which compares ctm with the random tensor networks for @xmath0 , the multiplier @xmath69 is chosen to be @xmath70 based on that this is the simplest covariant choice .",

    "indeed the flow in fig.[fig : rgflow ] has been drawn with these choices .",
    "one can also check that other covariant choices such as @xmath72 do not change the qualitative nature of the flow and therefore the coincidence between the phase structure of the random tensor networks and the one implied by ctm with @xmath0 .    though the coincidence is remarkable for @xmath0 , from further study generalizing gauge conditions and values of @xmath4",
    ", we have noticed that there exist some problems in insisting the coincidence as follows :    * first of all , no physical reasons have been given for the coincidence .",
    "a primary expectation is that there exists a renormalization group procedure for statistical systems on random networks , and the procedure is described by the hamiltonian of ctm in some manner .",
    "however , it is unclear how one can define a renormalization group procedure for statistical systems on random networks , which do not have regular lattice - like structures . * as will explicitly be shown later , in the case of @xmath6 , the phase transition lines deviate from the expectation from the hamilton vector flow of ctm .",
    "what is worse is that different choices of @xmath69 , such as @xmath73 or @xmath74 , give qualitatively different hamilton vector flows , which ruins the predictability of the transition lines from the flow . * in fig.[fig : rgflow ] for @xmath0 , on the phase transition lines , the flow goes along them , and there exist a few fixed points of the flow on the transition lines .",
    "the fixed point at @xmath75 is a co - dimension two fixed point , and the associated phase transition is expected to be of second order rather than first order , if the flow is rigidly interpreted as a renormalization - group flow and we follow the standard criterion @xcite .",
    "this is in contradiction to the actual order of the phase transition .",
    "this contradiction is more apparent in the diagram in another gauge in section [ sec : comparison ] .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to solve all the above problems , and to show that ctm actually gives an exact correspondence to random tensor networks .",
    "it turns out that @xmath69 should not be given by any ",
    "reasonable \" choices as above , but should rather be determined dynamically as @xmath76 to be discussed in the following sections . then , we can show that the hamiltonian of ctm actually describes a coarse - graining procedure of random tensor networks , and that the hamilton vector flow is in perfect agreement with the phase structure irrespective of values of @xmath4 .",

    "on the other hand , the correlation length of the ising model on random networks is known to be finite even on the curie point @xcite .",
    "this means that , even starting from the curie point , a renormalization process will bring the system to one with a vanishing correlation length .",
    "this implies that the curie point can not be a fixed point of a renormalization - group flow , and this is correctly reflected in the fact that our flow does not vanish on the curie point .",

    "we tried other possibilities such as @xmath149 , etc . , but the flow depended on the choices , and no good agreement could be found . on the other hand , in the right figure based on our new proposal @xmath132 , the flow in the symmetric region s is consistent with the phase structure :",

    "therefore , the flow has generally directions away from the @xmath7 symmetric subspace , and can not be drawn on the figure . to also check the consistency of the flow in these regions",
    ", it would be necessary to extend the parameter region .",
    "this would require to take a different systematic strategy for consistency check to avoid too many parameters . in section  [ sec : theorem",

    "in section  [ sec : ren ] , we argued that @xmath151 provides a renormalization procedure for the random tensor network .",
    "as can be seen from and , @xmath111 diverges in the limit @xmath152 in . on the other hand , in the numerical analysis of section  [ sec : comparison ] , @xmath18 is kept normalized as and by appropriately tuning the multiplier @xmath66 for the scale transformation @xmath153 ( with @xmath154 as well ) . as in fig.[fig : phasen=2 ] and [ fig : phasen=3 ] , one can find fixed points of the flows in the limit @xmath155 , where @xmath156 denotes the fictitious parameter parameterizing the normalized flows . in this section , we will show that these two limits of @xmath68 and @xmath156 are physically equivalent .",
    "let us first show the divergence in @xmath152 more directly . since @xmath157 from , @xmath158 .",

    "now let us compare the two flows , unnormalized and normalized ones",
    ". for notational simplicity , let us denote the three indices of @xmath2 by one index as @xmath165 .",
    "the flow equations in @xmath68 and @xmath156 can respectively be expressed as @xmath166 where @xmath66 generally depends on @xmath167 , and @xmath168 are the quadratic polynomial functions of @xmath18 , which can be read from .",
    "the last term of the second equation comes from @xmath169 in , and is assumed to be tuned to satisfy a gauge condition normalizing @xmath170 . here",
    "we ignore the @xmath53 generators , @xmath171 , for simplicity , but it is not difficult to extend the following proof to include them .",
    "the physical properties of the random tensor network do not depend on the overall scale of @xmath18 .",
    "so let us define the relative values of @xmath111 and @xmath170 as @xmath172 where @xmath173 is taken from one of @xmath174 , or a linear combination of them . from , it is obvious that @xmath175 and @xmath176 actually depend only on @xmath177 and @xmath178 , respectively .",
    "then , from , @xmath179 in the same manner , @xmath180 note that the last term of does not contribute to the flow equation of @xmath178 . since the initial condition implies @xmath181 , and the righthand sides of and are identical , the flow equations , and , describe an identical flow with a transformation between the fictitious parameters , @xmath182    as discussed above , the typical behavior of @xmath183 is , while @xmath184 is assumed to remain finite near an absorption fixed point .",

    "in section  [ sec : comparison ] , we see that the renormalization - group flow has discontinuity on the first - order phase transition lines in the examples of the random tensor networks . in this section , we will prove a general theorem on this aspect .    by using the free energy in the thermodynamic limit ( [ eq : exactf ] ) , the stationary condition ( [ eq : stationary ] ) and the flow equation ( [ eq : floweq ] )",

    "the reverse , @xmath197 , is obviously true from .",
    "therefore , the statements ( i ) and ( ii ) are equivalent : @xmath198 .    next , as for ( ii ) @xmath199 ( iii ) , it is obvious that , if @xmath47 is continuous , the renormalization group flow ( [ eq : floweq ] ) is also continuous .    finally , let us prove ( iii)@xmath199(ii ) , which will complete the proof of the theorem . to prove this",
    ", we will show that there is a contradiction , if we assume both ( iii ) and that @xmath47 has discontinuity on @xmath18 .",
    "let us suppose that there is discontinuity of @xmath47 at a point @xmath18 .",
    "then , from the definition of @xmath47 , there exist multiple distinct solutions of @xmath47 to which give the same minimum of at @xmath18 .",
    "let us take any two of them , @xmath200 and @xmath201 . as shown above , @xmath196 is continuous at any point , which means @xmath202 where the value is denoted by @xmath203 for later usage . here",
    "note @xmath204 , since , otherwise , diverges and can not be the minimum . then , since @xmath205 both satisfy , we obtain @xmath206 where @xmath207 , and has been obtained by considering the difference of the two equations in .",
    "note @xmath208 , if there exist multiplicity of the solutions .",
    "on the other hand , the assumption ( iii ) and imply @xmath209 then , by contracting with three @xmath200 s or @xmath201 s , and using , we obtain @xmath210 finally , by contracting with @xmath211 , we obtain @xmath212 where we have used .",
    "this concludes @xmath213 , which contradicts the initial assumption of the existence of discontinuity of @xmath47 .",
    "consequently , we have proven the equivalence of ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) .    ' '' ''     + by taking contrapositions , a corollary of the theorem is given by +   + * corollary 1 : * the following three statements are equivalent .",
    "* @xmath18 is a first - order phase transition point .",

    "the renormalization - group flow is not continuous at @xmath18 .",
    "another corollary of physical interest is +   + * corollary 2 : * if @xmath18 is a phase transition point higher than first - order , the renormalization - group flow is continuous at the critical point .",
    "+   + the qualitative behavior of the @xmath0 renormalization - group flow shown in the right figure of fig.[fig : phasen=2 ] respects the theorem and corollaries as it should be : corollary 1 is realized on the phase transition lines , and corollary 2 on the curie point .",
    "in the previous paper @xcite , it has been found that the phase structure of the ising model on random networks ( or random tensor networks with @xmath0 ) can be derived from the canonical tensor model ( ctm ) , if the hamilton vector flow of the @xmath0 ctm is regarded as a renormalization - group flow of the ising model on random networks .",
    "this was a surprise , since ctm had been developed aiming for a model of quantum gravity in the hamilton formalism @xcite .",
    "considering the serious lack of real experiments on quantum gravity , the aspect that ctm may link quantum gravity and concrete statistical systems would be encouraging .",
    "the main achievement of the present paper is to have shown that the hamilton vector flow of ctm with arbitrary @xmath4 gives a renormalization - group flow of random tensor networks , where the @xmath0 case , in particular , corresponds to the ising model on random networks . in the previous paper @xcite , we considered the hamiltonian of ctm , @xmath214 , with  reasonable \" choices of @xmath69 .",
    "though it was successful in the @xmath0 case , we have shown in this paper that the previous procedure of taking @xmath24 does not work for general @xmath4 , and have argued that the correct one is given by @xmath215 , where @xmath104 are the integration variables for describing random tensor networks . here",
    "an advantage of the present procedure is that @xmath24 is uniquely determined by the dynamics of random tensor networks , but not by the ambiguous  reasonable \" choices of the previous procedure .",
    "in fact , applied on random tensor networks , @xmath215 is an operator which randomly inserts vertices on connecting lines , and therefore it increases sizes of tensor networks .",
    "this provides an intuitive understanding of the role of @xmath24 as a renormalization process .",
    "we have performed the detailed analysis of the process , and have actually derived the hamilton vector flow of ctm as a renormalization - group flow of the random tensor network . in the last section ,",
    "we have proven a theorem which relates the phase transitions of the random tensor network and discontinuity of the renormalization - group flow .    the renormalization - group flow which we have obtained has discontinuities on the first - order phase transition lines .",
    "however , there is a critical argument on whether a renormalization - group flow has discontinuities on a first - order phase transition line @xcite .",
    "since the argument basically assumes a regular lattice - like structure of a system , it would be interesting to investigate a similar argument for a system with a random network structure .",
    "the random tensor network would give an interesting playground to deepen the idea of the renormalization group in a wider situation .",
    "finally , let us comment on possible directions of further study , based on the achievements of the present paper .",
    "one is the classification of the fixed points of the hamilton vector flow .",
    "this will provide the classification of the phases and their transitions of the random tensor network .",
    "this would also be interesting from the view point of quantum gravity . as discussed in @xcite",
    ", the physical wave functions of ctm may have peaks at the values of @xmath18 invariant under some symmetries .",
    "in general , on such symmetric values of @xmath18 , @xmath47 may have multiple solutions , and therefore they are phase transition points .",
    "such interplay between peaks and phase transitions may give interesting insights into quantum gravity .",
    "another direction would be to pursue possible relations between the renormalization procedure of the random tensor network and that of the standard field theory .",
    "in fact , the  grand \" partition function @xcite of the random tensor network can be arranged to take the form of a partition function of field theory on a lattice by considering an index set labelling lattice points and taking @xmath18 so as to respect locality .",
    "then , the hamilton vector flow of ctm may be regarded as a renormalization - group flow of the standard field theory .",
    "it would be highly interesting if ctm makes a bridge between quantum gravity and the standard field theory .",

    "a hamilton vector flow is generated by , and , for a given @xmath69 , the multipliers associated to the kinematical symmetries , @xmath219 and @xmath66 , can be determined so that the flow stays in the gauge . then , since @xmath220 and @xmath129 are kept constant by such a flow , determining such a hamilton vector flow is actually equivalent to considering @xmath214 , where @xmath221 and @xmath222 are substituted by solving the linear equations , @xmath223 . here",
    "we do not write the explicit resultant expression of @xmath24 , since it is rather long but the procedure itself is elementary .",
