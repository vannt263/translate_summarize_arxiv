    "an important development in the statistical mechanics of hydration has been the quasichemical organization @xcite of the potential distribution theorem .",
    "this approach provides a rigorous , statistical mechanical framework to relate the thermodynamics of solute - water clusters to the bulk hydration of the solute . in practical implementations , approximations to the quasichemical theory are invariably made . in the _ primitive _ quasichemical approximation ,  the adjective _ primitive _ indicates neglecting the role of the bulk medium on the local clustering reaction  the thermochemistry of ion - water clustering in the ideal gas phase , obtained using standard quantum chemistry approaches , is coupled with estimates of the response of the bulk medium , treated either as a dielectric continuum @xcite or as a discrete molecular solvent @xcite .",

    "<S> this effect is more pronounced for soft ions . since the coordination number that minimizes the excess chemical potential of the ion is identified as the optimal or most probable coordination number , for such soft ions , the optimum cluster size and the hydration thermodynamics obtained without account of the bulk medium on the ion - water clustering reaction can be different from those observed in simulations of the aqueous ion . </S>",
