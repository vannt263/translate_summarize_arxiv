    "although substituting nb into the bst system reduces the twin formation and @xmath3 significantly , its dielectric constant and spontaneous polarization was found to be increased sharply  @xcite .",
    "basically , fe are highly insulating , which prohibits direct current transport measurements .",
    "consequently , measurements on polarization and dielectric constant are of more relevant to characterize fe . due to its dielectric effect , fe has been exploited in microwave devices such as tunable oscillators , phase shifters and varactors  @xcite .",
    "moreover , fe also have the potential applications for detectors and devices based on the energy conversion principle namely , mechanical@xmath8thermal@xmath8electrical energies  @xcite .",
    "yet another technological advancement of fe is its functionality as a gate insulator in field - effect transistor ( fet ) as reported extensively by de boer _",

    "one of their interesting observation is the dielectric constant s inverse dependence on carrier mobility .",
    "furthermore , developments of the dielectric gate that consists of la , al and oxygen to substitute the common sio@xmath9 has been successfully produced and even patented  @xcite .",
    "perovskite fe with ferromagnetic properties such as ( tb , y , bi)mno@xmath10 have been investigated experimentally  @xcite due to its possible technological impact on magneto - electric media , including the dynamic random access memory ( dram ) devices .",
    "bst related oxides are studied in the thin film form , usually grown by pulsed - laser deposition technique .",
    "parallel to this , there are reports on the influence of the film s thickness with fe . in this respect ,",
    "a generalized ginzburg - devonshire theory was employed to evaluate the behavior of the fe thin film coated with two metallic electrodes  @xcite .",
    "zheng  _ et al_.  @xcite found that imperfect surface produces non - uniform polarization distribution and subsequently gives rise to the phase transition temperature or @xmath3 .",

    "the reasons to revivify the dielectric functions and the screened coulomb potential with ifds is two - fold .",
    "the first one is as stated above , while the second reason being , to further our evaluation on the actual role of phonon in the cuprate superconductors and also to justify why hole compensation effect is unnecessarily invoked in the first - principles approach for the ferromagnetic semiconductors , both of which will not be addressed here .",
    "it is well known that for free - electrons , the thomas - fermi screening length determines the screened coulomb potential while the bare coulomb potential is recovered when the electrons density is literally zero .",
