    "special interest has been devoted to transport in ratchet systems ( also termed brownian motor systems ) , i.e. to the phenomenon of noise assisted , directed motion of particles in spatially periodic structures which possess a broken reflection symmetry @xcite . in contrast , the quantum properties of directed transport are only partially elaborated in such brownian motor systems @xcite .",
    "challenges arise in the quantum regime because the transport can strongly depend on the mutual interplay of pure quantum effects like tunneling and particle wave interference with dissipation processes , nonequilibrium fluctuations and external driving @xcite .",
    "moreover , there exist typically no analogous closed evolution equations of such system as in the classical regimes , which are based for example on langevin or fokker - planck equations .",
    "however , special quantum regimes can be described nevertheless by use of effectively classical methods .",
    "for example , if the system strongly interacts with a thermostat , quantum diffusive dynamics can be described by an effective classical smoluchowski equation for the diagonal part of the statistical operator in the position representation @xcite , in which the potential and diffusion coefficient are modified due to quantum effects ( section 2 ) .",
    "this so called quantum smoluchowski equation has been applied to describe activation processes , quantum diffusion , and brownian motors @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we employ it to study the transport properties of an overdamped brownian motor moving in a spatially periodic potential @xmath0 of the period @xmath1 under the influence of an external , constant bias force when driven by both , thermal equilibrium and nonequilibrium fluctuations .",
    "we analyze the classical as well as the quantum regimes .",
    "in particular , the resulting _ current - load characteristics _ are investigated as functions of the system parameters like load , temperature and amplitude of the nonequilibrium noise ( section 3 ) .",
    "for systems strongly interacting with a thermostat , which in turn implies a strong friction limit , the quantum dynamics above the crossover temperature to pure quantum tunneling @xcite can be described in terms of a generalized smoluchowski equation which accounts for the leading quantum corrections . for a particle of mass @xmath2 moving in the potential @xmath3 , this quantum smoluchowski equation ( qse ) for the coordinate - diagonal elements of the density operator @xmath4 ,",

    "we study the induced current - load characteristics as a function of all system parameters and elucidate how one can control the directed transport by adjusting the ( inverse ) temperature @xmath57 , the dichotomic noise strength @xmath46 and the strength of the constant force @xmath58 .",
    "we next address the question of how the constant bias load @xmath58 affects the directed transport properties of the quantum and the corresponding classical brownian motors that are driven out of equilibrium by a nonthermal dichotomic random force @xmath24 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we present the current  load characteristics for the dichotomic noise level @xmath59 and a ratchet potential with @xmath60 , see panel ( a ) in fig .",
    "the three sets of curves correspond to three different values of the dimensionless inverse temperature @xmath61 .    in the absence of thermal ( gaussian ) noise , the dynamics of the driven particle",
    "is confined to a single period as long as the bias forces remain limited to the interval [ @xmath62 $ ] with @xmath63 and @xmath64 denoting the two threshold values .",
    "then , the dichotomic noise alone with @xmath65 is not able to induce transitions to the neighboring periods ; this becomes possible only in the presence of additional , thermal gaussian noise of unbounded amplitude which in turn induces a finite probability current . for larger thermal noise strength ( i.e. for smaller @xmath57 or higher temperature ) ,",
    "the quantum corrections seemingly play only a minor role for the probability current , see in fig .",
    "it is only for lower temperatures @xmath14 that the influence of quantum effects become more pronounced and distinct deviations from the classical response behavior become detectable .    the value of the constant bias , for which the current vanishes , is termed the _ stall force _ @xmath66 . generally , this stall force depends on the temperature @xmath67 and on the other system parameters as well .",
    "[ fig1 ] depicts that by cooling down the system ( i.e. increasing the inverse temperature @xmath57 ) the stall force becomes shifted toward larger positive loads .",
    "this means that for lower temperatures the ratchet effect becomes more pronounced .",
    "moreover , only for small enough temperatures one can resolve the different values of the stall force for the classical motor and the quantum motor dynamics . if the temperature is high , then both the quantum and the classical characteristics are very similar and , additionally , both current - load characteristics cross the zero - current axis at values that are close to zero .",
    "this corresponds to a rather weak ratchet effect .    with a value for",
    "the two  state noise fluctuations set at @xmath59 and for the ratchet potential defined by @xmath68 depicted in panel ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] , we observe a pronounced influence of the quantum corrections on the transport @xcite . also in this case with @xmath68 the dichotomic force amplitude @xmath24 alone can not induce transport , and the transitions over the potential barriers are triggered by thermal activation .",
    "the limiting force thresholds in this case read : @xmath69 and @xmath70 .    at zero bias ( @xmath71 )",
    ", the quantum and classical motors now proceed in the _ opposite directions _ within a large range of temperatures , see in the central panel in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . by applying a large enough constant load either into positive or negative direction ,",
    "this feature is seemingly destroyed .",
    "the motors are forced to transport accordingly to the applied bias .",
    "for very small values of the force , however , this very intriguing behavior induced by quantum fluctuations is still preserved at low temperatures .    in the fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we plot the current as a function of the dichotomic noise amplitude @xmath46 .",
    "the ratchet potential is the same as the one used in fig .",
    "the rescaled inverse temperature is set rather large at @xmath72 .",
    "we compare the resulting classical and quantum currents for five various values of the constant force @xmath73 .    the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] depicts the brownian motor currents for the unbiased case @xmath71 .",
    "we recover a distinct feature of the ratchet dynamics , namely , the occurrence of current reversals @xcite , both in the classical and in the quantum case , located however at different @xmath46-values . in presence of a sufficiently large bias force",
    "these current reversals disappear and the classical and quantum currents approach each other .    for small values of the dichotomic noise strength @xmath46 and in the absence of the external load , classical and quantum currents assume almost identical values , see the central panel in fig .",
    "4 . in this regime of small dichotomic noise strengths and non - zero bias ,",
    "the absolute value of the quantum current is always larger than its classical counterpart .",
    "quantum noise induced , directed transport features of an overdamped brownian motor moving in a spatially periodic ratchet potential , that is exposed to the constant load in the presence of nonequilibrium , adiabatically varying dichotomic fluctuations , are investigated with this work .",
    "the classical and the quantum regimes , being determined by the ratio of two energy scales ( the energy of thermal equilibrium fluctuations and the activation energy over barriers ) , are analyzed in detail .",
    "there is no a general rule on the influence of quantum corrections on current : as a function of the system parameters , the quantum effects may either increase or as well decrease the average current of the so forced brownian motors .",
    "the impact of quantum corrections is also clearly encoded in a shift of position of the respective values for the stall force .",
