    "an electronically excited atom ( or molecule ) can decay to the ground state by spontaneous emission .",
    "the characteristic rate at which this occurs is not simply an intrinsic property of the atom but also depends on the environment .",
    "the spontaneous emission rate is proportional to the density of electromagnetic field modes ( dos , or `` density of states '' ) , which is determined by the electromagnetic boundary conditions",
    ". the dos can thus be modified , and with it the spontaneous emission rate .",
    "the boundary conditions imposed by the environment not only change the radiative linewidth but also induce energy level shifts and thus change the transition frequencies .",
    "these include the electrostatic or van der waals shift , the casimir - polder shift ( modification of the lamb shift ) , and resonant radiative shifts . for a review",
    "see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "modified spontaneous emission was first observed by drexhage @xcite , using dye monolayers separated from an interface by fatty acid layers . both inhibited and enhanced spontaneous emission have since then been observed by others in a variety of geometries and circumstances @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the radiative linewidth of an atom _ in vacuo _ at a distance of the order of an optical wavelength from a dielectric surface has never been investigated experimentally .",
    "energy level shifts have been studied for atom inside cavities @xcite and in vapor cells , using selective reflection spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the situation of an atom in front of a distant mirror has recently been investigated using a single trapped ion .",
    "both the broadening of the radiative linewidth and energy level shifts have been reported for this system @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we experimentally investigate the radiative properties of cold ( @xmath1k ) atoms of @xmath0rb close to a glass surface , at a distance on the order of an optical wavelength . using our method of evanescent - wave spectroscopy @xcite",
    "we have observed a broadening of the absorption linewidth .",
    "we compare our observations with calculations based on cqed .",
    "the radiative linewidth @xmath2 is proportional to the power spectral density of the vacuum field fluctuations at the position of the atom @xcite , i.e. the local dos .",
    "the proximity of a dielectric surface imposes a boundary condition on the field , changing the dos .",
    "this leads to a modification of @xmath2 and to energy level shifts @xcite .",
    "both the linewidth broadening and the level shifts are significant mainly at distances @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the wavelength of the dominant electronic transition . in our case",
    "this is the @xmath5 resonance line of rb , and @xmath6 nm .",
    "therefore we probe the cold atoms near the glass surface using evanescent - wave ( ew ) spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "this method is selectively sensitive to atoms very close to the surface .",
    "an ew appears when our probe beam undergoes total internal reflection at the glass surface with index of refraction @xmath7 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "the optical field on the vacuum side decays exponentially with the distance @xmath8 to the surface , @xmath9 .",
    "atoms can absorb light from the ew , if their distance to the surface is on the order of the decay length @xmath10 .",
    "the decay length can be adjusted by changing the angle of incidence @xmath11 according to @xmath12 . by adjusting @xmath11",
    "we can thus vary the distance scale at which the atoms interact with the probe light . by increasing @xmath11 further above the critical angle @xmath13",
    ", the absorption will occur closer to the surface , where @xmath2 is more strongly modified .    for atoms in free space , the absorption profile",
    "is given by a lorentzian profile , centered at the ( free - space ) atomic transition frequency @xmath14 and with a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) equal to the natural linewidth @xmath15mhz . both @xmath16 and @xmath17 change in the proximity of the surface .",
    "roughly speaking these @xmath8-dependent lorentzians become convoluted with the ew energy density @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , in our experiment @xmath19 also contributes to the observed absorption linewidth through inhomogeneous broadening .",

    "was used to monitor variations in the probe power .",
    "we also collect the fluorescence from the mot to normalize for shot to shot variations of the number of atoms.,width=188 ]    the major part of our experimental setup has been described previously @xcite .",
    "we produced clouds of cold @xmath0rb atoms using magneto - optical trapping inside a ultra high vacuum cell ( base pressure @xmath21 mbar ) .",
    "after postcooling in optical molasses we ended up with about @xmath22 atoms , at a temperature of 9  @xmath23k . at this temperature",
    "the doppler width is 90  khz ( fwhm ) .",
    "the cooling lasers were then switched off and the atoms fell down toward the surface of a glass prism , about 3.6  mm below .",
    "the center of the cloud reached the prism surface and the ew spot after 27  ms . just before hitting the surface ,",
    "the atoms briefly interact with a weak , @xmath24-polarized , ew probe beam , see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "the intensity of the probe was kept well below the saturation intensity to avoid power broadening . using @xmath25w and a waist of about 1  mm ,",
    "the maximum saturation parameter was @xmath26 .",
    "the probe beam was derived from a home - built diode laser system , locked to the @xmath27 crossover resonance in the @xmath5 line of @xmath0rb ( 780 nm ) .",
    "we used an acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) to shift the probe frequency near resonance with the @xmath28 transition and to tune it across the resonance . before sending it into the cell ,",
    "a fraction of the probe beam was split off and sent to a photodiode as a reference .",
    "after total internal reflection on the prism surface the probe beam was focused on a second photodiode .",
    "the photocurrents of the two photodiodes were subtracted to obtain our signal , typically a fraction of @xmath20 of the probe .",
    "the difference photocurrent was amplified by a low - noise current amplifier ( femto , lca-100k-50 m , 50  mv / a transimpedance ) and sent through a low - pass filter ( @xmath29ms ) to further reduce the noise .",
    "all photodiode signals , including a power monitor and a mot fluorescence monitor were acquired using a digital storage oscilloscope .",
    "the latter two signals were used to normalize the absorption signals for variations in the probe power and shot - to - shot variations in the number of cold atoms .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : time - trace ] we show a typical ew absorption time trace with the probe beam tuned near resonance , for an angle of incidence @xmath30 .",
    "the signal has been averaged 100@xmath31 to reduce the noise . without filtering ,",
    "the absorption signal has a gaussian shape due to the velocity distribution of the falling atoms .",
    "however , in order to suppress slow drifts in the difference photocurrent we used ac coupling ( i.e. a high - pass filter ) on the oscilloscope . as a result the gaussian signal has been distorted .",
    "furthermore it is superposed on an exponentially decaying transient originating from switching off the mot / molasses beams .",
    "although we shielded the photodiodes from the molasses light as much as possible , some light is still detected .",
    "unfortunately the time between switching off the lasers and the arrival of the atoms at the surface is fixed by gravity .",
    "the position of the peak corresponds to the fall time of the atoms .",
    "the width is given by the ratio of the size ( @xmath32  mm ) and velocity ( @xmath33  m / s ) of the atom cloud as it reaches the surface . the height of the peak is @xmath34  mv , which corresponds to an absorbed power of @xmath35  pw .",
    "the time - integrated signal amounts to @xmath36 absorbed photons , or @xmath34 scattered photons per atom in the center of the ew .",
    "if we tune the probe laser away from resonance , or increase the angle of incidence , the signal amplitude decreases and the number of scattered photons drops to much less than one per atom .",
    "eventually the signal disappears in the noise , which is dominated by shot noise .     a typical time - of - flight signal taken with the evanescent - wave probe beam ( 100@xmath31 average ) .",
    "the peak around 27  ms is due to the absorption of evanescent probe light by cold atoms arriving at the surface . as a result of high pass filtering",
    "the signal has been distorted and sits on top of an exponentially decaying transient ( @xmath37 time 26  ms).,width=264 ]",
    "despite the signal distortion , we can extract the amplitude and width of the original gaussian , by fitting the filtered time trace to an analytical expression .",
    "this expression involves error functions due to the known step response function of the filter .",
    "we took the fitted height of the gaussian as the measure for the amount of absorption .",
    "the gaussian width is essentially constant .",
    "thus , the height of the peak is proportional to the absorbed ew power , which depends on the ew detuning and the angle of incidence .    for a given angle of incidence we measured time traces for different detunings of the ew probe .",

    "the absorption from the ew probe beam can be calculated by performing a spatial integration of the photon scattering rate over the vacuum half space @xmath49 .",

    "we also show the result of the calculation if we do not take the level shifts into account . clearly ,",
    "the effect of the level shifts on the observed linewidth is comparable with the direct broadening effect .    from the figure we also see that the observed broadening of up to about 25% is larger than the calculated broadening by about a factor two . this can not be explained by the most obvious sources of spurious broadening .",

    "a drift of the laser frequency can be excluded by the same argument , plus the free - space data point .",
    "a possible mechanism that would have the correct signature is transit time broadening . to investigate this we numerically integrated the time - dependent optical bloch equations for an atom moving through the ew field .",

    "first , the known ground state level shift was used to solve for the accelerated motion @xmath100 towards the surface .",
    "this solution was then used to define a time - dependent rabi - frequency @xmath101 , and similarly for the detuning @xmath102 , and radiative linewidth @xmath103 . using these time dependent parameters we numerically integrated the optical bloch equations to obtain the time evolution of the bloch vector @xmath104 . note that power broadening is naturally included in this method .",
    "the number of photons scattered by the atom on its way down to the surface was obtained as @xmath105 @xcite . again",
    "an averaging over the magnetic @xmath75-levels was performed .",
    "finally the probe detuning was varied and a lorentzian fit to the obtained absorption profile was performed , as before .",
    "the results of the bloch equation approach are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : finalplot ] .",
    "the two calculations yield very similar results .",
    "this shows that transit time broadening does not explain the discrepancy between calculations and measurements .    as a tentative explanation we invoke the presence of local stark shifts caused by charged or polarized particles on the surface .",
    "based on a straightforward model calculation we find that a surface charge density of @xmath106 yields a 10% linewidth increase . remarkably , such a charge density corresponds to an average distance between the charges of order @xmath107 nm , which is just the distance scale to which our experiment is very sensitive .",
    "these calculations only weakly reproduce the angular dependence shown by the data .",
    "recently mcguirk _ et al .",
    "_ have reported that rb adsorbed on a si or ti surface generates local stark shifts that were measurable as a change in the trapping frequency of their magnetic trap @xcite .",
    "the authors mention that similar effects on a glass surface like ours are very small . however , their experiment measured only _ changes _ upon depositing clouds of rb atoms on the surface , whereas our experiment is also sensitive to statically present adsorbates .",
    "furthermore , there may be other charged or polarized adsorbates on the surface . for",
    "these reasons local stark shifts do seem to present a likely mechanism to explain our results .",
    "our experiment is also complementary to ref .",
    "@xcite in the sense that the latter measures a global effect , whereas our experiment is sensitive only to local variations of the electric fields .",
    "unfortunately we have no detailed information about possible adsorbates to make a more quantitative analysis .",
    "in conclusion , we have observed a broadening of the absorption linewidth of the @xmath5 resonance line of @xmath0rb , caused by the surface .",
    "part of the broadening can be explained as a combined effect of cqed linewidth broadening and level shifts due to the proximity of a dielectric surface . the observed broadening of up to 25% was about twice that expected from cqed calculations .",
