    "since its invention in 1950 , the method of separated oscillatory fields  @xcite has been widely used in physics experiments . particularly in the field of atomic clocks where it made possible successive improvements of the performances by many orders of magnitude .",
    "indeed , by exciting the atomic transition with separated oscillatory fields , the width of the resonance is inversely proportional to the free evolution time between the two excitation pulses . as a consequence ,",
    "any method allowing to increase the free evolution time results in an improvement of the clock performance .",
    "the separated oscillatory fields method was first applied to thermal atomic beams where the free evolution time is of the order of @xmath0-@xmath1  s , limited by the length of the resonator . with the advent of laser cooling , it became possible to produce fountains of cold atoms  @xcite , and thereby to increase the free evolution time to approximately @xmath2  s mainly limited by the free fall due to the earth gravitational field and geometrical constraints .",
    "all atomic fountain clocks using laser cooled atoms that currently contribute to tai ( international atomic time ) are based on a pulsed mode of operation : atoms are sequentially laser - cooled , launched vertically upwards and interrogated during their ballistic flight before the cycle starts over again  @xcite .",
    "this approach has made possible important advances in time and frequency metrology : state - of - the - art fountains are operated in national metrological institutes at an accuracy level below @xmath3 in relative units .",
    "our alternative approach to atomic fountain clocks is based on a continuous beam of laser - cooled atoms . besides making the intermodulation effect negligible  @xcite ,",
    "a continuous beam is also interesting from the metrological point of view .",
    "indeed , the relative importance of the contributions to the error budget is different for a continuous fountain than for a pulsed one , notably for density related effects ( collisional shift ) , which are an important issue if high stability and high accuracy are to be achieved simultaneously .    as a motivation for our work , evaluation of the second order zeeman shift in atomic fountain clocks requires a precise knowledge of the magnetic field in the free evolution zone .",
    "the methods developed in pulsed fountains to map the magnetic field in the resonator are based on throwing balls of atoms at different altitudes .",
    "this is not applicable to our continuous fountain since the atomic trajectory is not vertical and therefore the launching velocity range is limited by geometrical constraints .",
    "moreover , the atomic beam longitudinal temperature is higher in our continuous fountain ( @xmath4  @xmath5k ) than in pulsed fountains ( @xmath6  @xmath5k ) and as a consequence the distribution of apogees is wider .",
    "the effect of this large distribution of transit time is to modify significantly the ramsey pattern , reducing the number of fringes but also increasing its dependance on magnetic field inhomogeneities .",
    "the work presented in this article is devoted to developping a new method to investigate the magnetic field in the atomic resonator where the free evolution takes place . in thermal beams standards ,",
    "the shape of the ramsey signal has been used as a diagnostic tool to measure the distribution of transit times and thus the atomic beam longitudinal velocity distribution  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in this article",
    "we will show that , in a continuous atomic fountain , the fourier analysis of zeeman sensitive ramsey fringes allows one to measure the time - averaged magnetic field seen by the atoms during their free evolution .",
    "moreover , it gives a better understanding of the shape of the ramsey pattern that we observe in our continuous atomic fountain .",
    "more precisely , it helps one to understand the difference between the position of the central fringe ( for which the microwave is in phase with the atomic dipole ) and the position of the fringe which shows the highest contrast .    in section  [ section1 ] we will give a brief description of our continuous atomic fountain focs-2 .",
    "then we will explain the principle of our analysis in section  [ section2 ] and present the experimental procedure and results in section  [ section4 ] .",
    "finally we will discuss and interpret the experimental results in section  [ section5 ] and conclude in section  [ section6 ] .",
    "in our experiment , we use the separated oscillatory fields method  @xcite to measure the transition probability of cesium atoms between @xmath7 and @xmath8 for @xmath9 . a scheme of the continuous atomic fountain clock focs-2 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig0 ] .",
    "the atomic beam is produced with a two - dimensional magneto - optical trap  @xcite .",
    "the atoms are further cooled and launched at a speed of @xmath10  m / s with the moving molasses technique  @xcite .",
    "the longitudinal temperature at the exit of the moving molasses is @xmath4  @xmath5k . before entering the microwave cavity",
    ", the atomic beam is collimated by transverse sisyphus cooling and the atoms are pumped into @xmath11 with a state preparation scheme combining optical pumping with laser cooling  @xcite .",
    "after these two steps , the transverse temperature is decreased to approximately @xmath12  @xmath5k . during the first passage into the microwave cavity",
    ", we apply a @xmath13-pulse ( duration of @xmath14  ms ) and thereby produce a superposition state which evolves freely for approximately @xmath2  s before the second @xmath13-pulse is applied during the second passage .",
    "finally , the transition probability between @xmath7 and @xmath8 is measured by fluorescence detection of the atoms in @xmath15 .",
    "ramsey fringes are obtained by measuring the transition probability as a function of the microwave frequency , which is scanned around each of the hyperfine transitions between the states @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "a magnetic field is used in the interogation zone to lift the degeneracy of the zeeman sub - levels .",
    "the ramsey fringes are formed by the superposition of individual atomic signals . because of the residual atomic beam temperature in the longitudinal direction , every atom has a slightly different trajectory with a different transit time . moreover ,",
    "the magnetic field in the free evolution zone has small inevitable spatial variations and therefore the average magnetic field seen by the atoms depends on the trajectory . as a consequence , information on both the atomic velocity distribution and the magnetic field profile is contained in the experimental ramsey fringes for @xmath16 .",
    "our objective is to retrieve this information from a measurement of ramsey fringes .",
    "then the atomic beam is collimated with sisyphus cooling in the transverse directions , and before entering the microwave cavity , the atoms are pumped in @xmath17 by state preparation . finally , after the second passage in the microwave cavity , the transition probability is measured by fluorescence detection of the atoms in @xmath15 .",

    "as explained in the previous section , the ramsey fringes measured in our continuous atomic fountain are formed by the superposition of ramsey signals coming from individual atoms .",

    "in other words , the fourier transform of the ramsey signal gives access to the distribution of transit times _ and _ to the dephasing induced by residual magnetic field spatial variations when @xmath16 .",

    "the phases of the fourier transforms superpose to each other in the domains of @xmath24 values where the module is different from zero .",

    "this is the distance between two consecutive ramsey fringes , therefore , determining the correct curve ( @xmath77 ) is a problem equivalent to finding the central fringe in the ramsey pattern ( see section  [ centralfringesection ] ) . in the evaluation process of the continuous fountain focs-2 , we used a complementary method ( time resolved zeeman spectroscopy ) to measure the magnetic field spatial profile and thus lift the above mentioned ambiguity  @xcite .",
    "this technique consists in applying short pulses of an oscillating magnetic field in order to induce zeeman transitions ( @xmath82 ) at different positions along the atomic trajectory .",
    "it allowed us to identify the @xmath77 curve in fig .",

    "[ fig : fig6 ] we observe that @xmath71 shows a local minimum @xmath83 and a local maximum @xmath84 .",

    "since the transit time is not unique , the same is true for the position of the central fringe .",
    "the distribution of central fringe positions is given by @xmath92 .",
    "in the situation of focs-2 , the function @xmath71 changes smoothly on the extent of the transit time distribution .",

    "therefore , the position @xmath99 of the overall fringe pattern on the frequency axis is given by imposing the condition @xmath100 with @xmath101 given in eq .",

    "secondly , the linear zeeman shift , calculated from the measurement of @xmath71 shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : fig5 ] , we observe that the velocity values are in good agreement at the nominal launching velocity of @xmath51  m / s which gives the maximum flux . for other launching velocities , the velocity distribution is truncated by geometrical selection due to diaphragms on the atomic beam trajectory ( see figs .
