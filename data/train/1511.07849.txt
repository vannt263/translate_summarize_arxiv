    "many fundamental aspects and practical issues in the physics of interfaces are related to controlling interactions between surfaces @xcite . in his seminal article @xcite , de gennes pointed out the importance of van der waals and electrostatic forces in adsorption , adhesion and wetting phenomena .",
    "recently , it became obvious that controlling forces between macroscopic bodies or surfaces is crucial for a variety of applications such as mechanics of nanomachines , stability of colloids and communication between biological cells , for instance @xcite .",
    "the growing interest for nanoelectromechanical systems ( nems ) urges the scientific community to deeply study van der waals and electrostatic interactions within nanostructured systems @xcite .",
    "in particular , looking at nanostructures in the theoretical framework of dispersive ( van der waals ) interactions turns out to be of great interest , from both fundamental perspectives and quantum based - technologies @xcite . in order to understand the influence of surface corrugations on lifshitz - van der waals interactions between macroscopic bodies ,",
    "many approaches have emerged , each one addressing specific corrugation geometries @xcite . on one hand ,",
    "additive methods , such as the proximity force approximation ( pfa ) or the pairwise summation ( pws ) , appear to be the most employed ones while describing interactions between smooth corrugated surfaces at short and long separation distances , respectively @xcite . on the other hand , while considering corrugated surfaces with small correlation length ( of the order of the separation distance ) , nonadditive methods such as the scattering or perturbative approaches are required in order to take into account diffraction and correlation effects which occur at the nanoscale @xcite .",
    "however , it is noteworthy that refinements of the above mentioned approaches have led to their progressive convergence for specific corrugations size and shape @xcite .",
    "this article focuses on small correlation length nanostructures with steep features . in this case , the assimilation of the surface corrugation to a graded effective refractive index layer is relevant @xcite and allows simplifying greatly the application of nonadditive methods , while still taking fully into account electrodynamical coupling between features as it will be explained below .",
    "motivated by recent theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite studies , we introduce the novel concept of manipulating quantum vacuum photon modes at the sub-10 nm scale in order to turn lifshitz - van der waals interactions from attractive to repulsive .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "after introduction ( section i ) , we present in section ii the theoretical framework used for the description of the lifshitz - van der waals interactions and we explain our theoretical approach for calculating the interfacial energy in the case of steep nanocorrugated surfaces . the relevant approximation used to describe steep nanocorrugated surfaces",
    "is introduced and justified in the section iii . in section iv we report on computational results and discuss how sub-10 nm corrugations allows us to control quantum vacuum photon modes and , by this way , to turn the lifshitz - van der waals force from attractive to repulsive .",
    "perspectives and general remarks are finally provided in section v.     and @xmath1 interacting _ via _ an intervening medium @xmath2 .",
    "the two bodies are separated by a distance _",
    "l_. @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) is the fresnel reflection coefficient of slab @xmath5 ( slab @xmath1 ) .",
    "the surface of body @xmath1 is nanopatterned with corrugations that are described by a graded effective medium.,title=\"fig:\",width=8 ]",
    "over the last decades , the lifshitz - van der waals approach of interfacial interactions in macroscopic systems has been widely investigated , both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "although usually attractive , the interaction potential energy may become repulsive if particular conditions are satisfied @xcite .",
    "let us first consider a body ( 1 ) interacting with a body ( 2 ) _ via _ an intervening medium ( 3 ) ( fig .",
    "1 ) . let us also consider for the moment that each element of this macroscopic system has a planar geometry ( for now body ( 2 ) is treated as a flat homogeneous slab ) and is characterized by a dielectric function @xmath6(i@xmath7 ) , where i@xmath7 is the imaginary angular frequency .",
    "it is well established that repulsive lifshitz - van der waals interactions between the two bodies can take place if the following condition is satisfied @xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the dielectric function of the i@xmath10 component of the system .",
    "( 1 ) can not be satisfied if the intervening medium is vacuum .",
    "therefore , a liquid or a gas is needed to satisfy eq .",
    "( 1 ) for given slab materials @xcite",
    ". moreover , in practice , eq .",
    "( 1 ) imposes tight constraints on the choice of both the materials and the intervening medium , which makes challenging the experimental observation of repulsive lifshitz - van der waals interactions @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we introduce an original approach to modify lifshitz - van der waals interactions in a very different perspective , beyond the constraint set by eq .",
    "( 1 ) . by tuning the virtual photon exchange between the two bodies , _ via _ nanopatterning of the surface of one of them ( fig .",
    "1 ) , it is possible to obtain a repulsive interaction potential energy , without any modification of the chemistry of materials , _",
    "i.e. _ without changing their dielectric functions .",
    "the nature of the lifshitz - van der waals force  repulsive or attractive  is solely the result of controlling light - matter quantum interactions at the nanoscale .",
    "the concept briefly described above is based on the fundamental interplay between physics of confined media and optical cavities . here",
    ", the concept of confined space is applied to the particular geometry of a planar - like cavity @xcite ( fig .",
    "actually , the present approach relies on joined effects of electromagnetic confinement and surface patterning at the nanoscale which are exploited to modify the interaction potential energy .",
    "in addition , since the studied system can be regarded as an optical cavity , it is possible to establish a formal link between optical properties of the cavity ( quality factor @xmath11 for instance ) and lifshitz - van der waals forces between the slabs forming that cavity .    at the macroscopic level , the force , thus the interaction potential energy , between two planar surfaces is related to the lowest ( zero - point ) energy state of the electromagnetic ( em ) field , arising from the existence of virtual photons of energy @xmath12 at all available frequencies which are exchanged between both surfaces @xcite . the interaction potential energy _",
    "u _ can be written as @xcite @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the angular frequency of the k@xmath10 vacuum photon - mode available between the two surfaces separated by a length _",
    "@xmath15 can be then easily related to the density of em states @xmath16 of the system such that : @xmath17 .",
    "the quantity @xmath16 can be obtained from classical electrodynamics .",
    "the tuning of the zero - point energy is possible thanks to the presence of surfaces ( boundaries ) , _ i.e. _ , the presence of allowed modes of the em field within the cavity @xcite .",
    "taking this fact into account , the force appears at the macroscopic level as the result of a manifold of vacuum photon modes occurring because the em field must meet the appropriate boundary conditions at each surface .",
    "moreover , these vacuum photon modes can be altered by patterning the surfaces @xcite , i.e. em field boundaries .    as explained above , the interaction potential energy considered in the present case results from the exchange of virtual photons between two interacting bodies . by summing the individual energies related to each mode available within the cavity",
    ", we can retrieve the total energy of the system from the photon density of states .",
    "based on these arguments , we apply the so - called scattering approach @xcite to calculate the interaction potential energy between two bodies facing each other .",
    "accordingly , the interaction potential energy _",
    "u _ is given by :    @xmath18    where _ l _ is the separation distance between the bodies , @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the generalized complex reflection coefficient of the first body ( second ) in the _ m _ polarization state ( _ s _ or _ p _ states ) , @xmath21 is the parallel component of the photon wave vector and @xmath22 is the imaginary angular frequency @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that , in this method , the nanopatterned slab ( here body ( 2 ) ) is treated as a graded effective medium ( see @xcite and discussion below ) .    for short separation distances ( _ l _ @xmath23 10 nm ) , eq .",
    "( 2 ) is well approximated by the so - called hamaker formula @xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the effective hamaker constant of the system which can be deduced from the numerically computed energy , _",
    "i.e. _ , eq .",
    "( 2 ) .    in case",
    "the intervening medium is vacuum , eq .",
    "( 2 ) appears to be efficient since it reproduces well experimental results @xcite . in this case , using eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , it is possible to retrieve the hamaker constant @xmath26 of the system ( @xmath26 @xmath27 , where ( 3 ) is omitted when the intervening medium is vacuum ) . using the same procedure , it is also possible to retrieve the hamaker constant @xmath28 of the flat surface .",
    "the effective hamaker constant @xmath29 of the patterned surface , on the other hand , can be deduced indirectly from the well - known relation @xcite @xmath30 by using values of @xmath26 and @xmath28 calculated from eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .    for numerical convenience @xcite , instead of computing directly @xmath25 via eq . ( 2 )",
    "to obtain the interaction potential energy , we compute the effective hamaker constant of the system ( hereafter , ( 3 ) stands for fluid ) from the well - known relation @xcite :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 are the hamaker constants of the corresponding media which are obtained from the above described procedure .",
    "repulsive interaction potential energy is reached when @xmath25 is negative , _",
    "( 3 ) . therefore , according to eq .",
    "( 4 ) , such a condition is fulfilled when :    @xmath33    the condition imposed by eq .",
    "( 5 ) goes beyond the constraint set by eq .",
    "indeed , when considering a nanopatterned surface , as in the present case , eq .",
    "( 1 ) can not be used since dielectric functions are those of flat materials . on the other hand , eq .",
    "( 5 ) allows to bypass this problem since the effective hamaker constant of the nanopatterned surface can be calculated by the above described procedure .",
    "therefore , eq . ( 5 ) has a more general application since it can be used simultaneously for both flat and nanopatterned surfaces .     of nanopatterned polyethylene slab ( see inset ) as a function of cones height @xmath34 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=8 ]",
    "let us now develop the case of a practical two - body system consisting of two polyethylene ( pe ) slabs facing each other and separated by a _",
    "l _ distance . in order to fulfill eq .",
    "( 5 ) , we choose water ( medium 3 ) as intervening medium .",
    "it must be pointed out that such a configuration does not match eq .",
    "the first slab ( slab 1 ) has a flat ( planar ) surface while the second one ( slab 2 ) is nanostructured with cones of height _ h _ arranged on a hexagonal lattice with a lattice period chosen to be @xmath35 = 10 nm ( fig .",
    "1 ) . we choose a fixed cone base radius of @xmath36 = 5 nm and a variable cone height _ h _ ( ranging from 10 to 100 nm ) in order to alter the optical properties of the surface .",
    "indeed , such a geometry is known to improve the antireflection behavior of the surface which in turns alters the vacuum photon modes of the system @xcite . moreover , since the pe surface is hydrophobic @xcite , we can assume a cassie state @xcite between water and the corrugated pe surface @xcite .",
    "as a consequence , the void space between cones is filled by air and water is localized above the top of the cones only .    at wavelengths below 20 nm ,",
    "pe permittivity is close to unity @xcite and thus only vacuum modes above this spectral range are relevant . since the lattice period is shorter than the relevant wavelength range , the patterned surface can be described by an effective material , _",
    "i.e. _ an effective medium approach ( ema ) , with a graded permittivity @xmath37 along its thickness such that : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the pe dielectric function , @xmath40 is the filling fraction given by @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath43 the radius of the circular section of the cones at coordinate _",
    "the use of the ema has to be justified with great care .",
    "indeed , such an approximation usually requires the separation distance _",
    "l _ to be equal or larger than the lattice parameter @xmath35 of the periodically nanostructured surface @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the distance is one of the main parameter determining the nature of the electromagnetic modes ( radiative or evanescent ) involved in the calculation of the lifshitz - van der waals interaction . in the case of a separation distance shorter than the lattice parameter ,",
    "evanescent modes are dominant and are able to reproduce the details of the nanostructure , thereby invalidating the ema @xcite . however , in the present situation , the ema remains valid for the separation distances shorter than the lattice parameter .",
    "this non - intuitive result emerges from the weakness of the coupling between diffracted and specular orders due to both the optical properties of pe and the steepness of the corrugation ( see appendix a for a detailed justification of the use of ema ) .    the impact of the choice of water as the intervening medium has to be examined .",
    "indeed , as a polar liquid , water induces an electrostatic double layer at both surfaces facing each other , giving rise to an additional electrostatic repulsive force between them which , in experiments , could screen the lifshitz - van der waals repulsive force treated here .",
    "however , while considering the cassie state regime , the electrostatic double layer is located only on the top of the cones which become steeper while increasing the cones height . as a consequence ,",
    "the electrostatic double layer associated to the steep nanocorrugated pe surface becomes extremely small , leading to a dramatic decrease of the electrostatic repulsive interaction ( see appendix b ) .",
    "therefore , in the present situation , the electrostatic repulsive interaction can be neglected compared to the lifshitz - van der waals interaction for any corrugations height .",
    "the corner stone of the present approach is related to the fact that tuning antireflective properties of the bottom slab ( thanks to nanocorrugations ) allows tailoring the virtual photon exchange within the cavity formed by the top flat pe slab and the bottom corrugated pe slab @xcite .",
    "since the presence of virtual photons causes dispersive interaction energy between slabs , it enables the control of the magnitude of attraction / repulsion between the two surfaces by only playing on the photon mode density inside the cavity .",
    "of flat polyethylene / patterned polyethylene system immersed in water ( schematic view in the inset ) as a function of cones height @xmath34.,title=\"fig:\",width=8 ]",
    "as explained previously , the use of a fluid as intervening medium led no choice but to compute individual hamaker constants of each component of the system in a first step .",
    "we calculate from previously reported data @xcite the effective hamaker constant @xmath29 of the corrugated pe slab using eq .",
    "( 2 ) and eq . ( 3 ) for various cones height ( fig .",
    "2 ) . knowing the hamaker constant @xmath28 of flat pe surface ( @xmath44 ev ) @xcite and the hamaker constant @xmath45 of water ( @xmath46 ev ) @xcite , we then calculated the hamaker constant @xmath25 of the whole system from eq .",
    "( 4 ) , as a function of the cones height ( fig .",
    "strong decrease of the hamaker constant @xmath25 with increasing cones height is observed , going from positive to negative values ( fig .",
    "3 ) . here , the zero - crossing point for @xmath25 takes place for @xmath47 nm .",
    "this critical point is reached when @xmath48 ( horizontal red - dotted line , fig .",
    "2 ) , in accordance with the fact that repulsive interaction is achieved only if eq . ( 5 ) is satisfied .",
    "therefore , the interaction potential energy becomes positive , _",
    "i.e. _ repulsive force ( fig .",
    "4 ) , for @xmath49 as soon as the hamaker constant @xmath25 of the system becomes negative ( see footnote @xcite ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that , due to the small zero - crossing point value @xmath50 , it could be experimentally difficult to achieve a progressive transition from attractive to repulsive force while increasing the cones height ( see footnote @xcite , @xcite )",
    ". thus , observation of this progressive transition would require higher @xmath50 value which could be achieved by using flat materials with hamaker constants @xmath29 ( @xmath34 = 0 ) higher than the hamaker constant @xmath45 of the intervening medium ( by at least one order of magnitude , see fig .",
    "2 ) . furthermore , owning to the cassie state regime of the present model , such materials are difficult to find @xcite .",
    "consequently , the transition from attractive to repulsive regimes can not be easily observed as well as significantly modified ( _ i.e. _ @xmath50 value stays in the same range for most of the materials ) .",
    "such a dramatic modification of the dispersive energy of the system arises from the strong decrease of the hamaker constant @xmath29 of the nanopatterned pe slab as the cone height increases ( note the logarithmic scale in fig .",
    "phenomenologically , this result can be explained by the fact that the increase of the cone height @xmath34 causes the decrease of the reflection coefficient of the nanopatterned pe slab @xmath51 .",
    "consequently , the quality factor _ q _ of the fabry - perot cavity also decreases ( fig .",
    "5a ) since @xcite :    @xmath52    where @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the optical absorption loss of the intervening medium ( 3 ) for a single path in the cavity ( i.e. @xmath54 is given by beer - lambert law ) .",
    "moreover , the mean value of the quality factor @xmath55 was calculated by integration of eq .",
    "( 7 ) in the relevant spectral range from 50 nm to 300 nm ( fig .",
    "we observe a decrease of @xmath55 as the cones height increases , down to 49 % of the initial value ( _ i.e. _ for flat slabs ) ( fig .",
    "5b ) . as _",
    "_ decreases , the em energy stored into the fabry - perot cavity is reduced @xcite ; _ i.e. _ , the number of vacuum photon modes available within the cavity and which contribute to the interaction potential energy @xmath56 diminishes . therefore , the attractive behavior of the interaction potential energy becomes weaker while , owing to the geometry of the studied system and the choice of materials , the repulsive behavior becomes stronger . on overall ,",
    "controlling the optical properties of the cavity enables tuning the strength of the attractive / repulsive force .",
    "it is noteworthy that such an interpretation , although based on solid physical ground ( i.e. the energy storage in an optical cavity ) , relies on a heuristic approach and still requires the establishment of a direct theoretical link between the quality factor and the lifshitz - van der waals interaction .",
    "in conclusion , we showed theoretically that extremely small and steep nanoscopic corrugations on the surface of one of the two interacting bodies are able to turn lifshitz - van der waals interaction from attractive to repulsive , as well as to control the strength of their interaction by changing the corrugations height .",
    "the present approach is appealing since it offers the possibility to achieve repulsive interaction only by nanopatterning one of the surfaces .",
    "therefore , constraints with respect to the choice of materials @xcite are relaxed . in the end",
    ", we are aware of the fact that an experimental proof of the concept is a very difficult task due to engineering complexity related to the achievement of the pattern depth of just a few nanometers . however , in the light of a recent experimental study @xcite , the presented concept could open new perspectives to control attractive / repulsive interactions by nanopatterning .",
    "indeed , fabricated patterns could be used to control macroscopic interactions in a variety of applications ranging from biology @xcite to material science for controlling wettability , adhesion and adsorption @xcite .",
