    "pure - shape rpm _ is a mechanics in which only relative times , relative angles and ratios of relative separations are meaningful .",
    "it was originally proposed in @xcite and further studied in @xcite .",
    "note that these theories are relational in barbour s sense of the word ( which is more specific than rovelli s distinct sense of the word , c.f .",
    "@xcite ) , which involves the following postulates and implementations .",
    "\\1 ) these theories are _ temporally relational _",
    "i.e. , there is no meaningful primary notion of time for the whole system ( e.g. the universe ) .",
    "this is mathematically implemented by using actions that are manifestly reparametrization invariant while also being free of extraneous time - related variables [ e.g. newtonian time or general relativity ( gr ) s lapse ] .",
    "this reparametrization invariance then directly produces primary constraints quadratic in the momenta @xcite .",
    "\\2 ) these theories are _ configurationally relational_. this can be thought of in terms of a certain group @xmath8 of transformations that act on the theory s configuration space @xmath9 leaving the physical configuration unchanged @xcite . for scaled rpm",
    ", @xmath8 is the euclidean group of translations and rotations and for pure - shape rpm it is the similarity group of translations , rotations and dilations .",
    "this can be implemented by such as using arbitrary-@xmath8-frame - corrected quantities rather than ` bare ' @xmath9-configurations .",
    "while this augments @xmath9 to the principal bundle @xmath10 , subsequent variation with respect to each adjoined independent auxiliary @xmath8-variable produces a secondary constraint linear in the momenta .",
    "this then removes both one @xmath8 degree of freedom and one redundant degree of freedom from @xmath9 .",
    "thus one does end up on the desired reduced configuration space ",
    "the quotient space @xmath11 .",
    "configurational relationalism includes both spatial relationalism ( for spatial transformations ) and internal relationalism ( in the sense of gauge theory ) .",
    "my principal motivation @xcite for studying rpm s is that they are useful toy models of gr its formulation as ` geometrodynamics ' ( evolving spatial geometries ) .",
    "this analogy is quite rich ( @xcite has a more detailed account ) .",
    "the extent of the resemblance ( particularly in the formulations @xcite of gr ) is comparable but different to the resemblance between gr and the more habitually studied minisuperspace models @xcite .",
    "rpm s have a quadratic energy constraint @xmath12 that is analogous to gr s quadratic hamiltonian constraint @xmath13 .",
    "rpm s have a linear zero total angular momentum constraint @xmath14 is a nontrivial analogue of gr s linear momentum constraint @xmath15 ( for @xmath16 a spatial index ) .",
    "this is a structure which minisuperspace only possesses in a trivial sense , and yet it is important for a large number of detailed applications , some of which are discussed below .",
    "also rpm s ( unlike minisuperspace ) have notions of locality in space and thus of clustering / structure .",
    "this is e.g. useful for cosmological modelling .",
    "rpm s have many further useful analogies @xcite as regards conceptual aspects of quantum cosmology , including the problem of time @xcite .",
    "this notorious problem occurs because ` time ' takes a different meaning in each of gr and ordinary quantum theory .",
    "this incompatibility underscores a number of problems with trying to replace these two branches with a single framework in situations in which the premises of both apply , such as in black holes or the very early universe .",
    "one facet of the problem of time appears in attempting canonical quantization of gr due to @xmath13 being quadratic but not linear in the momenta .",
    "then elevating @xmath13 to a quantum equation produces a stationary i.e timeless or frozen wave equation  the wheeler - dewitt equation = 0 ( for @xmath17 the wavefunction of the universe ) ",
    "instead of ordinary qm s time - dependent one , i / t = ( where i use @xmath12 to denote a hamiltonian and @xmath18 absolute newtonian time ) .",
    "see @xcite for other facets of the problem of time .",
    "some of the strategies toward resolving the problem of time are as follows .",
    "\\a ) perhaps one is to find a hidden time at the classical level @xcite by extending or rearranging ( 1 ) to @xmath19 ( for @xmath20 the momentum conjugate to some new coordinate @xmath21 that is a candidate hidden timefunction ) .",
    "one would then promote this to a hidden - time - dependent schrdinger equation i / t^ = _ .",
    "york time @xcite is a candidate hidden time for gr .",
    "it is associated with constant mean curvature foliations @xcite and corresponding conformal superspace ( pure shape ) formulations of gr @xcite .",
    "\\b ) perhaps one has slow heavy ` @xmath22 ' variables that provide an approximate timestandard with respect to which the other fast light ` @xmath23 ' degrees of freedom evolve @xcite . in the halliwell  hawking @xcite scheme for gr quantum cosmology , @xmath22 is scale ( and homogeneous matter modes ) and @xmath23 are small inhomogeneities . thus the scale  shape split of scaled rpm s afford a tighter parallel of this @xcite than pure - shape rpm s .",
    "the semiclassical approach involves firstly making the born ",
    "oppenheimer ansatz @xmath24 .",
    "secondly , one forms the @xmath22-equation ( @xmath25 for rpm s ) , which , under a number of simplifications , yields a hamilton",
    " jacobi degree of freedom and with no linear constraints . ]",
    "equation ( w / h)^2 = 2(e - v(h ) ) [ hamjac ] for @xmath26 the total energy and @xmath27 the @xmath22-part of the potential .",
    "thirdly , one way of solving this is for an approximate emergent semiclassical time @xmath28 .",
    "next , the @xmath23-equation @xmath29 can be recast ( modulo further approximations ) into an emergent - time - dependent schrdinger equation for the @xmath23 degrees of freedom i|/t^ = _ l| .",
    "[ tdse2 ] ( here the left - hand side arises from the cross - term @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the remaining surviving piece of @xmath32 ) .",
    "\\c ) a number of approaches take timelessness at face value .",
    "one considers only questions about the universe ` being ' , rather than ` becoming ' , a certain way .",
    "this has at least some practical limitations , but can address some questions of interest .",
    "example 1 : the _ nave schrdinger interpretation",
    "_ @xcite concerns the ` being ' probabilities for universe properties such as : what is the probability that the universe is large ? flat ?",
    "? homogeneous ?",
    "one obtains these via consideration of the probability that the universe belongs to region @xmath33 of the configuration space that corresponds to a quantification of a particular such property , @xmath34 , for @xmath35 the configuration space volume element .",
    "this approach is termed ` nave ' due to it not using any further features of the constraint equations .",
    "example 2 : the _ conditional probabilities interpretation",
    "_ @xcite goes further by addressing conditioned questions of ` being ' such as ` what is the probability that the universe is flat given that it is isotropic ' ?",
    "example 3 : _ records theory _",
    "@xcite involves localized subconfigurations of a single instant .",
    "more concretely , it concerns whether these contain useable information , are correlated to each other , and a semblance of dynamics or history arises from this .",
    "this requires notions of localization in space and in configuration space as well as notions of information .",
    "rpm s are superior to minisuperspace for such a study as , firstly , they have a notion of localization in space .",
    "secondly , they have more options for well - characterized localization in configuration space ( i.e. of ` distance between two shapes ' @xcite ) through their kinetic terms possessing positive - definite metrics .",
    "\\d ) perhaps instead it is the histories that are primary ( _ histories theory _",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "\\e ) another current program worth mentioning is a distinct timeless approach involving _ evolving constants of the motion _ ( ` heisenberg ' rather than ` schrdinger ' style qm ) , and _ partial observables _ @xcite .",
    "this is used e.g. in loop quantum gravity s _ master constraint program _",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "however , my main interest is in combining b ) to d ) ( for which rpm s are well - suited ) , and which is a particularly interesting prospect @xcite along the following lines .",
    "there is a records theory within histories theory .",
    "histories decohereing is one possible way of obtaining a semiclassical regime in the first place .",
    "what the records are will answer the also - elusive question of which degrees of freedom are decohering which others in quantum cosmology .",
    "in this paper i consider the case of 3 particles in 2-@xmath0 with scale ( _ scaled triangleland _ ) , particularly at the quantum level",
    ". scaled rpm is in some ways an easier theory than pure - shape rpm ( it was found earlier , it is easier to reduce @xcite ) .",
    "however , there are other ways in which it is not easier : maximal collision , the shape - scale interpretation of scaled rpm is an extension of the shape interpretation of pure - shape rpm .",
    "this is relevant as regards solving the multi - ho potential problem in hand , for it involves scale  shape split form which is a natural extension of pure - shape rpm work in @xcite .",
    "thus i consider it _",
    "after _ the quantum treatment of pure - shape rpm @xcite .",
    "sec 2 covers kinematics .",
    "firstly i describe triangleland in terms of relative jacobi coordinates , and explain that the configuration space of pure shapes  _ shape space _  of triangleland is @xmath2 .",
    "the _ relational space _ , that includes both the preceding and scale , is then the cone over @xmath2 .",
    "this is @xmath1 , but with a non - flat metric ; i exploit that it is , however , conformally flat . n.b . that the shape space is a nontrivial realization of @xmath2 , which involves dragt - type @xcite coordinates",
    "i then interpret as shape quantities : ellipticity , anioscelesness and four times the area of the triangle .",
    "i finally provide a tessellation of the shape space sphere , that enables one to read off which points correspond to equilateral triangles , collinear configurations , double collisions , isosceles triangles etc , which is useful in interpreting dynamical trajectories , potentials and wavefunctions on shape space and relational space .    in sec 3 ,",
    "i provide a classical prequel to the main quantum part of this paper , covering the ` scale - dominates - shape ' approximation and discussion of cosmologically - motivated choices of potential , as well as giving a qualitative account of the behaviour of the classical solutions .",
    "@xcite considers the counterparts of this work for 4 particles on a line ( which also has a @xmath2 shape space , but here with a simple rather than ` dragt ' realization ) .",
    "sec 4 sets up the quantum treatment of scaled triangleland , providing kinematical quantization , commutation relations , operator ordering , time - independent schrdinger equation and inner product in use .",
    "sec 5 covers solutions of this with various soluble and/or cosmologically - motivated potentials .",
    "much of this is analogous to , or an extension of , mathematics that occurs in the study of the atom .",
    "some of this working is in spherical polar coordinates . in the triangleland case ,",
    "these respect the shape  scale split , with @xmath3 as radius and @xmath4 a function of the ratio of relative separations of two constituent subsystems as azimuthal angle and the relative angle between these @xmath5 as polar angle .",
    "other parts of this working are in parabolic coordinates , which , for triangleland , are the same @xmath5 as before and essentially the partial moments of inertia of the constituent subsystems . in sec 6",
    "i provide interpretation in terms of expectations , spreads and a bohr moment of inertia for the model universe .",
    "this complements sec 5 s interpretation in terms of the probability density functions against the back - cloth of the tessellation of the sphere by its triangleland shape space interpretation .",
    "i also treat the inclusion of cosmological constant terms perturbatively .",
    "the conclusion ( sec 7 ) includes 1 ) some problem of time applications : hidden time , semiclassical time , histories theory and various timeless approaches .",
    "these are further developed in @xcite 2 ) another application @xcite involves examples of further operator ordering and dirac versus reduced quantization issues .",
    "a configuration space for 3 particles in 2-@xmath0 is @xmath36 . rendering absolute position irrelevant",
    "( e.g. by passing from particle position coordinates to any sort of relative coordinates ) leaves one on a configuration space _ relative space _ @xmath37 .",

    "the shape space sphere turns out to have radius 1/2 , as can be seen from the relational space line element s^2 = ^2 + ( ^2/4)(^2 + ^2 ^ 2 ) .",
    "this inconvenience in coordinate ranges is then overcome by using @xmath3 instead as the radial variable , s^2 = ( 1/4i)(i^2 + i^2(^2 + ^2 ^ 2 ) ) , _ pq = ( 1/4i , /4 , /4 ) .",
    "this metric @xmath79 is not the usual flat metric on @xmath1 : it is curved .",

    "furthermore , for triangleland , the @xmath4 and @xmath5 are related to the corresponding clustering s @xmath81 , and to relational space s unit cartesian coordinates @xmath82 , in a fairly unusual ` dragt - type ' @xcite way ( closely related to the hopf map ) : ^()_x = _ ( ) _ ( ) = 2_1^()_2^ ( ) _ ( ) = 2*n*_1^()_2^ ( ) , [ dragt1 ] ^()_y = _ ( ) _ ( ) = 2_1^()_2^ ( ) _ ( ) = 2(*n*_1^ ( ) _ 2^())_3 , [ dragt2 ] ^()_z = _ ( ) = _ 2^()2 - _ 1^()2 .",

    ", there is a dynamical notion of time that is generated by the hamiltonian .",
    "the main application i see for this rpm work on histories theory is the combination of semiclassical , histories theory and records theory ideas ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "quadrilateralland is possibly more interesting here ( it decomposes into disjoint nontrivial subsystems ) .",
    "however , it makes sense to deal with triangleland first , as it is simpler for a number of reasons .",
    "( some of these concern @xmath269 versus @xmath270 , but also others that become apparent in work in progress @xcite ) .",
    "rpm s semiclassical approach scheme are useful toy models of midisuperspace quantum cosmology models that investigate the origin of structure formation in the universe .",
    "( e.g. the halliwell  hawking model toward quantum cosmology seeding galaxy formation and cmb inhomogeneities ) .",
    "thus rpm s are valuable conceptually and to test whether we should or should not be _ qualitatively _ confident in the assumptions and approximations made in such schemes .",
    "the spherical presentation of triangeland is of limited use due to not extending to higher @xmath42-a - gonlands .",
    "however , one use for it is in allowing the shape part to be studied in @xmath2 terms which more closely parallel the halliwell  hawking @xcite analysis of gr inhomogeneities over @xmath161 .",

    "furthermore , there is the issue of whether there was a considerably more uniform quantum - cosmological initial state @xcite .",
    "there are also related issues of uniformizing process and how the small perturbations observed today were seeded .",
    "however , uniformity is a pure - shape notion , and so it has already been covered in @xcite ( and continues to apply as the shape part of the present paper s scaled model ) .",
    "the most uniform configuration here is the equilateral triangle .",
    "almost - equilaterality can be investigated by the nave schrdinger interpretation and is a notion of locality on configuration space .",
    "rpm s are also a toy model for robustness issues , i.e. whether ignoring some degrees of freedom substantially changes the outcome .",
    "this is along the lines of kucha and ryan @xcite questioning whether the taub model subcase sits stably inside the mixmaster model as regards making qm predictions .",
    "( this is itself a toy model of whether studying minisuperspace might be fatally flawed due to omitting all of the real universe s inhomogeneous modes ) .",
    "this was found to be unstable .",
    "rpm counterparts of this are rather more straightforward to investigate .",
