    "the primordial nature of the li observed in pop ii stars rests on the existence of the spite plateau , i.e. constant li abundance for dwarfs with @xmath1 @xmath25700 k and [ fe / h]@xmath3 - 1.5 .",
    "recently , some authors have claimed the existence of trends of li abundance both with @xmath1 and [ fe / h ] , and intrinsic dispersion on the plateau ( deliyannis et al 1993 , norris et al 1994 , thorburn 1994 , ryan et al 1996 ) .",
    "in addition , one star in m92 has been found with [ li]=2.5 , which is well above the plateau value ( deliyannis et al 1995 ) .",
    "these results would argue in favour of a depletion of li in the atmospheres of pop ii stars , weakening its cosmological significance .",
    "the existence of the spite plateau has been defended by molaro et al ( 1995 ) and spite et al ( 1996 ) .",
    "@xmath1 is the major source of error in the li abundance determination and a precise determination of @xmath1 is necessary in order to discuss possible trends or dispersion on the plateau .",
    "the best method to determine @xmath1 , short of a direct measure of the angular diameter , is the irfm ( blackwell et al 1990 ) .",
    "here we revise the li abundance for 64 pop ii stars , which are about 2/3 of the pop ii stars observed for li , using new irfm @xmath1 obtained by alonso et al ( 1996 ) .",
    "gravities have been recomputed for all the stars and results are shown in fig .",
    "the exclusion of the few possible subgiants from the sample does not alter significantly the results presented in this paper .",
    "the li ews have been taken from the literature . for multiple measurements we adopted the weighted average .",
    "the errors have been taken from the original papers , when available or estimated according the ryan et al ( 1996 ) prescriptions .",
    "abundances have been derived computing new atmospheric models by using the atlas9 code of kurucz with enhanced @xmath4-elements and without the overshooting option .",
    "the theoretical ews have been computed by direct integration of synthetic spectra computed with the synthe code , thus taking into account the doublet structure of the li 670.7 nm line .",
    "the models used are important in li analysis , and systematic differences among different authors of the order of 0.1 dex have been ascribed to different assumptions in the model computations ( molaro et al 1995 ) .",
    "the results , based on 41 plateau stars with @xmath1 @xmath2 5700 and [ fe / h ] @xmath5 , give a weighted mean value @xmath6 = 2.20\\pm 0.016}$ ] ( [ li ] = log(li / h)+12 ) . in good agreement with the value of [ li]@xmath7 of molaro et al ( 1995 ) , who used spectroscopically derived temperatures .",
    "the standard error is compatible with the estimated observational errors ( @xmath8 dex ) showing no evidence for intrinsic dispersion .",
    "no trends of [ li ] with [ fe / h ] are found over the range @xmath9",
    "< -1.5 $ ] . a tiny trend with @xmath1 is detected at 1 @xmath10 level .",
    "our current best estimate , based on a bivariate fit is : @xmath11=1.146 + 0.033(\\pm 0.046 ) \\times   [ fe / h]+0.018(\\pm 0.011)\\times t_{eff}/100}\\ ] ] our slope with @xmath1 is smaller by about a factor of two than that found by norris et al ( 1994 ) , thorburn ( 1994 ) and ryan et al ( 1996 ) and is compatible with the mild depletion predicted in this temperature range , by the standard models of deliyannis et al ( 1990 ) .",
    "the absence of a downturn in li abundance at the hottest edge of the plateau and the absence of dispersion on the plateau itself argue strongly against significant depletion by diffusion or rotational mixing .",
    "( vauclair 1988 , pinsonneault et al 1992 ) .",
    "the absence of a significant slope with @xmath1 and the absence of intrinsic dispersion rule out stellar winds as possible depletion mechanisms ( vauclair and charbonnel 1995 ) .",
    "all depletion mechanisms predict features that are present in the observed data .",
    "our results strongly support the view that the observed [ li ] in pop ii stars coincides with the primordial value .",
    "a plausible estimate for li@xmath12 can be deduced from the weighted mean of plateau stars after the small trend with t@xmath13 , predicted by the standard models of deliyannis et al ( 1990 ) , is accounted for ; thus leading to @xmath14_p = 2.240\\pm 0.016_{1\\sigma}\\pm 0.05_{sys}}\\ ] ] the systematic error follows from the error on the zero point of the t@xmath15 scale .",
    "this corresponds to two possible values for @xmath16 . with @xmath17 : @xmath18 but considering the full errors both in the li abundance and in the theoretical bbn predictions the minimum of the li sbbn prediction is allowed and the two intervals merge .",
    "our low @xmath19 is in agreement with that obtained from high deuterium values , d / h @xmath20 10@xmath21 ( songaila et al 1994 , carswell et al 1996 , wampler et al 1996 , rugers and hogan 1996 ) and with that obtained from primordial helium yp = 0.228 @xmath22 ( pagel et al 1992 ) .",
    "our high @xmath19 is more consistent with the yp=0.241 @xmath23 ( izotov et al 1994 ) who use revised neutral helium recombination coefficients , but it is remains inconsistent with the values from the low d / h=2@xmath24 observed in high redshift absorption systems ( tytler fan and burles 1996 , burles and tytler 1996 ) .",
    "the consistency between the low d / h value and li requires a 0.5 dex of depletion in li which is not supported by the present analysis .",
    "the two intercepts on the li theoretical curve corresponds to two preferred values for the baryon density @xmath25 where the hubble parameter is h@xmath26 = 100@xmath27 @xmath28 . considering that @xmath29 ( persic and salucci 1996 ) , over the entire range of h@xmath26 we have @xmath30 suggesting the presence of dark baryons . the low value for @xmath19 when combined with the high baryon fraction from x - ray of rich clusters leads to a total mass @xmath31 , and to the so called `` x - ray cluster baryon catastrophe '' .",
