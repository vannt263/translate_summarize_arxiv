    "the generation of highly energetic ion beams from laser - plasma interaction has attracted great interest in the last decade @xcite due to the broad range of applications including cancer therapy @xcite , short - lived isotope production for medical applications @xcite , isochoric heating of solid - density matter @xcite , proton radiography @xcite , and fast ignition in inertial confinement fusion @xcite . up to now the highest energy ions ( @xmath3 for protons @xcite and @xmath4 for carbon ions @xcite )",
    "have been achieved with high energy ( hundreds of joules ) and relatively long ( 0.5 - 1 ps ) laser pulses on the trident laser in the so - called break out afterburner ( boa ) regime @xcite . such source of high energy protons and ions is still not useful for societal applications because of the large size of currently used laser installations and the limited repetition rate . nevertheless , smaller laser facilities , delivering a few tens of j and short laser pulses , which can in principle operate at 10 hz repetition rate @xcite are more promising .    the boa regime , where the energy of accelerated protons is currently the highest in comparison with all other experimentally investigated regimes , relies on the fact that the laser pulse can burn through the target . in the experiments with longer and relatively high energy pulses ,",
    "this is achieved naturally due to rapid expansion of the target heated by the first part of the laser pulse @xcite . with shorter laser pulses",
    ", this can be however hardly achieved . in principle",
    ", one may use such an intense pulse that the target becomes relativistically transparent .",
    "however , such regime is not accessible at the moment . according to the estimate provided by d. jung _ et al . _",
    "@xcite based on the previous model @xcite , the onset of the relativistic transparency takes place at the time @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the ratio of initial electron density to the critical electron density , @xmath7 is the target thickness , @xmath8 normalized laser amplitude , @xmath9 laser pulse duration at fwhm , and ion sound speed @xmath10 .",
    "the lowest density compact solid matter , which is routinely available ( plastic targets ) has a free electron density of about 200 @xmath11 ( for the wavelength of ti : sapphire laser equal to @xmath12 ) , when fully ionized .",
    "thus , we can estimate that , for example , for laser pulse duration ( fwhm ) of @xmath13 and @xmath2 thick plastic foil , laser intensity about @xmath14 is required to obtain relativistic transparency during laser - target interaction .",
    "moreover , an ultraintense pulse works partially like a piston pushing a cloud of electrons ahead @xcite , which further increases the required intensity for very short pulses @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there might be another approach how to make the target relativistically transparent than increasing laser pulse energy and the pulse length - converting the laser pulse to higher frequency .",
    "for example , since the critical electron density @xmath15 , the same free electron density @xmath16 expressed in terms of critical density is reduced 9 times ( e.g. , it is reduced to @xmath17 for plastic foil ) for the third harmonics compared with the fundamental frequency .",
    "obviously , the parameter @xmath8 is also reduced but only 3 times for the third harmonics @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "since the relativistically induced transparency takes place when @xmath19 @xcite , the intensity required for relativistic transparency can be significantly reduced .",
    "namely , @xmath20 is required for the target to be relativistically transparent assuming that @xmath21 .",
    "again , required laser intensity can be partially reduced by assuming target expansion @xcite , which is important especially for longer laser pulses and for the similarity parameter @xcite @xmath22 .",
    "obvious argument against this approach can be that conversion to the third harmonics costs a lot of energy .",
    "on the other hand , it is known that this conversion greatly improves the contrast of the laser pulse and not only in the nanosecond domain but also in the picosecond domain @xcite .",
    "thus , the improvement of the laser pulse intensity contrast usually performed through the double plasma mirror technique @xcite , which implies a similar energy loss , can be avoided in such case .",
    "another clear argument can be that the electrons are less heated with lower @xmath8 and thus the proton energy should be smaller .",
    "however , we will demonstrate in this paper that such point of view does not apply here , because the regime of laser target interaction and proton acceleration is substantially different .",
    "in order to show in more detail the mechanism which was discussed above , we have employed our 2d3v particle - in - cell ( pic ) code @xcite ( with two spatial and three velocity components ) . in the simulations",
    ", we assumed the interaction of laser pulses with homogeneous fully ionized polyethylene @xmath23 foils of the density @xmath24 , where the free electron density is @xmath25 , at the wavelengths @xmath26 corresponding to the fundamental frequency ( @xmath27 ) and @xmath28 corresponding to the third harmonic frequency ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the electron density @xmath16 is equal to @xmath30 and @xmath31 for @xmath27 and @xmath29 cases , respectively .",
    "ultrahigh laser pulse contrast is assumed , thus , all targets are initialized with step - like density profile . in order to prevent numerical heating @xcite ,",
    "the initial plasma temperature is set to @xmath32 and the cell size is @xmath33 .",
    "the laser pulse has @xmath34 temporal shape of full duration about @xmath35 ( @xmath36 for @xmath27 case and @xmath37 for @xmath29 , where @xmath9 is the laser wave period ) . the peak intensity of linearly ( p-)polarized pulse is set to @xmath38 ( dimensionless amplitudes @xmath39 and @xmath40 for @xmath27 and @xmath29 cases , respectively , where @xmath41}$ ] ) .",
    "the focal spot diameter is set to @xmath42 at fwhm ( gaussian shape ) .",
    "the foils are irradiated at normal incidence since the acceleration of ions has been shown to be more efficient at normal than at oblique incidence for the laser pulse with the same parameters @xcite .",

    "initial position of the foil is marked by the dashed line.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    firstly , we illustrate the difference between using @xmath27 and @xmath29 pulses for the foil of thickness @xmath2 . at @xmath27 ( @xmath26 ) ,",
    "most of the laser pulse is reflected from the target , but a small part of the pulse can be transmitted through ( amplitude @xmath45 ) . at @xmath29 ( @xmath28 ) , large part of the laser pulse",
    "is transmitted through the target ( the foil is `` punched through '' before the end of the laser - target interaction ) due to the induced transparency , see fig .",
    "although @xmath8 is reduced almost three times by switching the laser frequency , the maximum proton energy in the forward direction is increased from @xmath46 at @xmath27 case to @xmath47 at @xmath29 case ( see proton energy spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) .",
    "this strongly differs from the standard model of target normal sheath acceleration ( tnsa ) mechanism @xcite , where the maximum ion energy is directly proportional to @xmath48 by assuming ponderomotive scaling of hot electron temperature @xcite .",
    "moreover , the number of accelerated ions can be also substantially increased .",
    "for example , the number of protons with energy higher than @xmath49 already suitable for proton therapy applications is enhanced by factor 4 in @xmath29 compared to @xmath27 case for the used target thickness .",
    "thus , two different ion acceleration regimes take place for the same foil thickness and laser pulse intensity , but different laser frequency . for @xmath29 pulse , an enhanced ion acceleration connected with relativistic transparency , such as laser breakout afterburner ( boa ) ,",
    "should be operative @xcite .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the enhancement of proton energy and number can be explained by a more efficient electron heating in @xmath29 case due to relativistically induced transparency .",
    "when the target is relativistically transparent , electrons can be accelerated by the ponderomotive force in the whole target volume ( given by the target thickness ) , whereas they are accelerated only in the surface layer determined by the skin depth for opaque targets .",
    "therefore , the work done by the ponderomotive force on the electrons is higher for thicker relativistically transparent targets ( @xmath29 case ) even if @xmath8 is smaller than for the opaque target ( @xmath27 case ) . in the energy spectra of electrons which are located behind the rear side of the foil ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ) , two distinct populations of hot electrons can be identified for @xmath29 whereas only one population appears for @xmath27 case .",
    "the first population can be approximated by @xmath52 , where the hot electron temperature @xmath51 is about @xmath53 and @xmath54 in @xmath27 and @xmath29 case , respectively .",
    "thus , one can observe that the temperature and number of hot electrons in the first population is enhanced for @xmath29 ( relativistically transparent ) compared with @xmath27 ( nontransparent ) case , which also corresponds to the increased absorption of laser pulse energy in the plasma ( 45% vs. 21% for @xmath29 and @xmath27 , respectively ) .",
    "the high - energy tail in the spectrum for @xmath29 case , which can be regarded as the second population of hot electrons , corresponds to the electron bunches directly accelerated by the propagating laser wave beyond the target similarly to the case of the so - called direct laser acceleration @xcite .",
    "we should note that this mechanism works also when a small target preplasma at the front or rear side was assumed in the simulations instead of initial step - like density plasma profile .",
    "for example , when an exponential density profile @xmath55 with the scale length @xmath56 was initialized and the thickness of the layer with constant maximum density was substantially reduced in order to keep the areal density of the target the same in the simulations , the maximum energy of accelerated protons only slightly differs ( about 5% at most ) for any combination of step - like and exponential density profiles on the target front / rear sides .",
    "the efficiency of ion acceleration varies with the target thickness as shown in several experimental and theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "moreover , one may obtain induced transparency with thinner targets more easily @xcite , especially when the target density is slightly above the threshold for induced transparency as in our case .",
    "therefore , in the following set of simulations , we illustrate the difference between using @xmath27 and @xmath29 pulses for various thicknesses of plastic foils ranging from @xmath57 to @xmath58 .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the dependence of ( a ) maximum energies , ( b ) numbers of high - energy protons , and ( c ) maximum energies of @xmath59 ions accelerated in the forward and backward directions ( with respect to the propagation direction of the incident laser beam ) as well as ( d ) the dependence of the ratio of the absorbed and transmitted laser pulse energy to the total laser beam energy on the foil thickness and laser frequency .",
    "the simulations show that a noticeable part of the laser pulse can propagate through the foil up to the thickness of @xmath60 for @xmath29 , whereas the thickness less than @xmath1 is required for @xmath27 case .",
    "note that the plasma skin depth @xmath61 @xcite , where @xmath62 assuming relativistic mass of electrons oscillating in the linearly polarized laser field with relativistic factor @xmath63 , is about @xmath64 and @xmath65 for @xmath27 and @xmath29 case , respectively .",
    "thus , the transmission of a substantial part of laser pulse energy through the foil could be explained by the thickness of the foil smaller than the skin depth for @xmath27 case . on the contrary ,",

    "only 3% of the laser pulse energy incident on the target is transmitted through the foil in the case of @xmath60 thickness .",
    "in fact , only a small rear part of the pulse propagates through with maximum amplitude @xmath70 . the amount of transmitted laser pulse energy as well as the length of the transmitted part of the pulse ( and its amplitude ) significantly increases with decreasing thickness . for @xmath68",

    "is transmitted and the maximum transmitted pulse amplitude is close to the amplitude of the incident laser pulse .",
    "however , the amount of the absorbed energy in the plasma is reduced for the thinnest foils as the density of the expanding foil decreases rapidly already during laser - target interaction .",
    "reduced laser pulse absorption and relatively low number of particles in the laser focal spot leads to the decrease of the number of high - energy protons even if the maximum energy only slightly falls for the thinnest foils .    at fundamental laser frequency",
    ", the enhancement of proton energy and number can be also observed with decreasing target thickness .",
    "however , such enhancement is less pronounced than for the third harmonic frequency .",
    "the increase in maximum energy for the foil of thickness @xmath2 compared with @xmath58 about 50% in the forward direction is in qualitative agreement with previous experimental observations at significantly lower maximum intensity of the pulse ( @xmath72 ) @xcite .",
    "the most efficient proton acceleration takes place at the foil thickness @xmath66 when the foil becomes transparent already during laser - target interaction due to its rapid expansion . in @xmath29 case ,",
    "the highest proton energy can be also observed for @xmath66 foil .",
    "nevertheless , the optimum thickness for @xmath29 is between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , since there is a clear maximum of the number of high - energy protons whereas the maximum energy is only slightly lower compared with @xmath66 foil .",
    "when a part of the laser pulse is transmitted through the foil , one can observe a strong asymmetry in terms of maximum energy of accelerated ions in the forward / backward direction ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ) .",
    "we observed this asymmetry when the transmitted part has amplitude @xmath73 ( when the @xmath74 term in the lorentz force becomes significant as the electric term ) . at amplitude @xmath73 , electrons oscillating in the laser wave",
    "have relativistic quiver velocity @xcite , their trajectories can be bent by the magnetic field of the wave towards laser propagation direction and their energy is enhanced .",
    "such increase of electron energy is translated into fast ions .",
    "the transmitted laser wave with amplitude @xmath73 is observed in our simulations only for targets with thickness equal or less than @xmath60 at @xmath29 case , whereas it is observed for all studied foils at @xmath27 ( even if the amount of transmitted laser pulse energy is below 1% for the foils thicker than @xmath66 ) .",
    "the dependence of maximum energy on the foil thickness is quite similar for heavier @xmath59 ions ( see fig . [",
    "fig3]c ) . since the protons from target surface layer",
    "are accelerated prior to heavier ions due to their higher charge to mass ratio , the protons partly shield accelerating electric field for @xmath59 ions .",
    "therefore , the maximum energy of @xmath59 ions per atomic mass unit is reduced on 20%-40% of the energy of protons .",
    "one can also observe that the ratio of the energy of @xmath59 ions accelerated in the backward direction to the energy of the ions accelerated in the forward direction is slightly enhanced compared with protons .",
    "the difference can be ascribed to acceleration of protons prior carbon ions towards target interior from the front ( laser - irradiated ) side due to radiation pressure in the initial stage of interaction , which subsequently leads to a relatively small amount of light ions ( protons ) on the target front surface compared with the amount of heavier ions .",
    "after laser - target interaction , a significantly lower number of protons on the front target side shields the accelerating electric field on carbon ions less than on the rear target side .      in the simulations described above , the target density was fixed at @xmath25 , which is a realistic density for fully ionized polyethylene @xmath23 foil . however ,",
    "this density was slightly above theoretical threshold for the induced transparency for a given laser pulse amplitude .",

    "the maximum energy of accelerated protons is equal to @xmath47 , whereas it is only @xmath78 in the backward direction ( see fig . [ fig4]a ) .",
    "when we increase the target density by factor 2 up to @xmath79 , the laser pulse is not transmitted substantially through the target ( electromagnetic wave with amplitude @xmath80 propagates behind the target ) and the maximum energy of protons accelerated in the forward and backward directions is almost the same @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively ( but the number of accelerated protons is substantially higher in the forward direction ) . on the contrary , when the density of the foil is twice or even four times decreased , proton energy in the forward direction increases further about 20% or 30% , respectively .",
    "then , the energy starts to decrease with the density . in the backward direction ,",
    "the energy is constant except for the lowest density case @xmath83 , where it decreases about 20% .",
    "thus , we found the maximum energy of accelerated protons for electron density of the foil @xmath84 ( @xmath85 for @xmath29 ) .",
    "however , for another important parameter - the number of high energy protons ( with energy higher than @xmath49 suitable for proton therapy ) , optimal target density between @xmath86 and @xmath44 ( @xmath87 and @xmath31 for @xmath29 , respectively ) was found in our simulations as can be seen in fig .",
    "it corresponds to the highest absorption of laser pulse energy into the plasma ( 39% and 45% , respectively ) .",
    "we should note that it does not mean optimal values for all laser and target parameters .",
    "the investigation of such dependency on various laser and target parameters is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "for example , one may suppose that the using of the 4th harmonics may be more beneficial when the target of higher density ( e.g. , metal foils ) would be assumed .",
    "in conclusion , we have proposed a significant enhancement of ion acceleration from ionized solid target by using ultrashort intense ( subpw ) laser pulse at higher harmonic frequency . in our numerical simulations , we have demonstrated the increase of maximum proton energy as well as the increase of the number of high - energy protons suitable for proton therapy by factor 2 by using the third harmonic frequency compared with fundamental frequency at optimal thickness of ionized plastic foil .",
    "higher energies and numbers of accelerated ions are explained by a more efficient electron heating and acceleration by the ponderomotive force in the whole target volume ( given by the target thickness ) when the target is relativistically transparent . since the laser intensity required for relativistically induced transparency",
    "is directly proportional to @xmath88 ( where @xmath89 is the laser wavelength and @xmath90 is the frequency ) , this regime is achievable more easily with higher ( harmonic ) laser frequency than the fundamental one .",
    "such strong enhancement of ion acceleration can surpass other enhancements which propose to use special targets like the ones with microstructures @xcite , foam @xcite , or grating @xcite on the surface .",
    "moreover , flat foil targets can be more easily produced than other special targets , which is important from the point of view of future applications of high repetition rate femtosecond lasers .",

    "<S> the influence of laser frequency on laser - driven ion acceleration is investigated by means of two - dimensional particle - in - cell simulations . </S>",
    "<S> when ultrashort intense laser pulse at higher harmonic frequency irradiates a thin solid foil , the target may become relativistically transparent for significantly lower laser pulse intensity compared to irradiation at fundamental laser frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the relativistically induced transparency results in an enhanced heating of hot electrons as well as increased maximum energies of accelerated ions and their numbers . </S>",
    "<S> our simulation results have shown the increase of maximum proton energy and of the number of high - energy protons by a factor of 2 after the interaction of an ultrashort laser pulse of maximum intensity @xmath0 with a fully ionized plastic foil of realistic density and of optimal thickness between @xmath1 and @xmath2 when switching from the fundamental frequency to the third harmonics . </S>"
