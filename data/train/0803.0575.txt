    "<S> the definition of ` learning space ' is recalled in our definition [ ls def ] . </S>",
    "<S> essentially , a learning space is a family of sets , called knowledge states , satisfying a couple of conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the elements of the sets are ` atoms ' of knowledge , such as facts or problems to be solved . </S>",
    "<S> a knowledge state is a set gathering some of these atoms . </S>",
    "<S> each of the knowledge states in a learning space is intended as a possible representation of some individual s competence in the topic . </S>",
    "<S> embedded in a suitable stochastic framework , the concept of a learning space provides a mechanism for the assessment of knowledge in the sense that efficient questioning of a subject on a well chosen subset of atoms leads to gauge his or her knowledge state . </S>",
    "<S> many aspects of these structures have been investigated and the results were reported in various publications ; for a sample , see @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the monograph by @xcite contains most of the results up to that date .    in practice , in an educational context for example </S>",
    "<S> , a learning space can be quite large , sometimes numbering millions of states . </S>",
    "<S> the concept of a ` projection ' at the core of this paper provides a way of parsing such a large structure into meaningful components . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , when the learning space concerns a scholarly curriculum such as high school algebra , a projection may provide a convenient instrument for the programming of a placement test . for the complete algebra curriculum comprising several hundred types of problems , a placement test of a few dozens problems can be manufactured automatically via a well chosen projection .    </S>",
    "<S> the key idea is that if @xmath2 is a learning space on a domain @xmath1 , then any subset @xmath0 of @xmath1 defines a learning space @xmath4 on @xmath0 which is consistent with @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we call @xmath4 a ` projection ' of @xmath2 on @xmath0 , a terminology consistent with that used by @xcite and @xcite for media . moreover , this construction defines a partition of @xmath2 such that each equivalence class is a subfamily of @xmath2 satisfying some of the key properties of a learning space . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , @xmath0 can be chosen so that each of these equivalence classes is essentially ( via a trivial transformation ) either a learning space consistent with @xmath2 or the singleton @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> these results , entitled ` projection theorems ' ( [ projectiontheorem1 ] and [ projectiontheorem2 ] ) , are formulated in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> they could be derived from corresponding results for the projections of media @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> direct proof are given here . </S>",
    "<S> this paper extends previous results from ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * theorem 1.16 and definition 1.17 ) and @xcite . </S>"
