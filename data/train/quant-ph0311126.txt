    "in common wisdom , randomness and noise are thought to be detrimental to any physical process , especially at a quantum level , and hence also for the ability of the system to encode and process quantum information @xcite . for classical systems",
    "the advent of phenomena such as stochastic resonance , brownian ratchets , and parrondo effects , have shown that noise may indeed play a helpful role after all @xcite .",
    "this opens up the intriguing question of whether randomness can play a useful role in quantum systems @xcite , particularly due to the widespread current interest in quantum information schemes @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the quantum communication scenario , and present a toy model where the noise plays a positive role .",
    "in particular , given a noisy quantum channel , we shall show that the addition of noise at the decoding stage can improve the channel capacity .",
    "let us consider a simple communication model as depicted in fig.[fig0 ] . at the sending station ,",
    "classical information is encoded into quantum states , which in turn are sent through a noisy quantum channel . at the receiving station",
    "a decoding procedure is performed with the addition of noise to the decoding operation .        in detail",
    ", we consider an input random binary variable @xmath0 taking values @xmath1 , @xmath2 and we encode it into quantum states according to the following rule , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a completely dephased coherent state of amplitude @xmath5 .",
    "we then take the noisy quantum channel to be an amplitude damping channel @xmath6 @xcite , the effect of which can be described by the map @xmath7 , with @xmath8 a parameter determining the amount of amplitude damping .",
    "finally , the output variable @xmath9 is determined by a decoding procedure involving a quadrature measurement , through the probability operator measure ( pom ) @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the binary character of @xmath9 comes out from a threshold detection of the type , @xmath11 where @xmath12 represents a fixed threshold .    at this point",

    "for @xmath15 the measurement converges to the ideal pom .",

    "furthermore , the conditional entropy for @xmath9 given @xmath0 is determined by @xcite , @xmath29 the channel capacity may then be obtained by maximizing the mutual information @xmath30 , over all possible input probabilities @xcite , explicitly , @xmath31\\,.\\ ] ] the input probability maximizing eq.([cdef ] ) may be shown to be , @xmath32 with , @xmath33\\,.\\ ] ]    in fig.[fig1 ] we graph the capacity @xmath34 versus the noise strength @xmath14 for different values of the threshold @xmath12 , when the encoding amplitude and channel damping are fixed to @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively .",
    "one can see that when the threshold @xmath12 becomes higher than the damped amplitude @xmath37 , the addition of the noise improves the distinguishability between the two outputs in the decoding stage , thus increasing the capacity .",

    "in conclusion , we have shown the noise enhancement of the classical information capacity of a quantum communication channel .",
    "analogous results have previously been found within the classical context @xcite .",
    "the effect can be ascribed to the ability of the noise to induce transitions on the threshold @xcite , and in our case it results from competition between two differing types of noise @xcite , the noise causing losses in the channel , and the noise broadening the pom .",
    "the noise benefit could be optimized by a suitable tailoring of the pom and of the involved parameters , but this requires large numerical resources .",
    "nonetheless , the present simple model can serve as a proof of principle and as a useful tool for further developments in more realistic schemes .",
    "in particular it could be relevant for systems that are constrained to receive signals through a fixed threshold @xcite .",
    "our approach paves the way for a thorough study of noise effects in nonlinear quantum channels .",
    "furthermore , the addition of stochastic noise on a channel may be helpful for quantum binary decision , which find applications in a variety of quantum measurement problems @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , quantum correlations ( entanglement ) have been exploited to improve both channel capacity @xcite and quantum binary decision @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to compare the two approaches and to eventually combine them ."
