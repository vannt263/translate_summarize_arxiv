    "dielectric thin film research has become increasingly important as the demand grows for smaller , faster , and more reliable electronics .",
    "for example , high permittivity thin films are under study in order to fabricate smaller capacitors while minimizing leakage .",
    "low permittivity materials are being sought to allow smaller scale circuits while minimizing undesirable stray capacitance between wires .",
    "nonlinear dielectrics , which have a dielectric permittivity which is a function of electric field , are being used in tunable devices , particularly at microwave frequencies .",
    "finally , ferroelectric thin films are a solution for large - scale , non - volatile memories .",
    "all of these dielectric thin film technologies demand high - quality , homogeneous films",

    "microwave measurements of permittivity have been made using transmission measurements through a microstrip structure@xcite , and reflection measurements from a corbino probe@xcite and similar geometries.@xcite however , these techniques average over large areas , and involve depositing thin film electrodes , which itself can alter the properties of the sample . dielectric@xcite and",
    "open@xcite resonators have been used as well , but suffer from low spatial resolution .",
    "cavity perturbation@xcite and waveguide transmission@xcite techniques have also been used , but have the disadvantage of measuring the entire sample . more recently , near - field microscopy",
    "techniques@xcite have allowed quantitative measurements with spatial resolutions much less than the wavelength .",
    "these techniques use a resonator which is coupled to a localized region of the sample through a small probe , and have the advantage of being non - destructive .",
    "however , it is still difficult to arrive at quantitative results and maintain high spatial resolution .",
    "previously , we introduced our solution , a near - field scanning microwave microscope ( nsmm ) , and its application to the low - resolution ( 100500 @xmath0 m ) quantitative imaging of sheet resistance@xcite and dielectric permittivity.@xcite in this paper , we present a method for using the nsmm for high - resolution ( @xmath8 m ) , quantitative imaging of thin film permittivity and tunability.@xcite",
    "our nsmm systems ( see fig .  [ schematic ] ) consist of a coaxial transmission line resonator which is terminated at one end with an open - ended coaxial probe , and at the other end is coupled to a microwave source with a coupling capacitor .",
    "the probe , which has a sharp - tipped center conductor extending beyond the outer conductor , is held fixed while the sample is raster scanned beneath the probe .",
    "a sample holder gently presses the sample against the probe tip with a force ( about 50 @xmath0n @xcite ) which is small enough that the sample is not scratched.@xcite because the rf fields are concentrated at the probe tip , the resonant frequency and quality factor q of the resonator are a function of the sample properties near the probe tip .",
    "a feedback circuit@xcite keeps the microwave source locked onto a selected resonant frequency of the microscope resonator , and outputs the frequency shift ( @xmath9 ) and q of the resonator .",
    "this data is stored by a computer , which also controls the scanning of the sample beneath the probe .",
    "we have shown previously that the spatial resolution of the microscope in this mode of operation is about 1 @xmath0m.@xcite    our probes@xcite are constructed using a short section of semi - rigid coaxial cable , where we have replaced the center conductor with a capillary tube of the same outer diameter .",
    "the probe tip is a commercial scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) conical tungsten tip@xcite which is inserted into the capillary tube , and held in place by friction .",
    "we apply a local dc electric field to thin film samples with a bias tee@xcite in the microscope resonator ( see inset to fig .  [ schematic ] ) , allowing us to make dielectric tunability measurements .",
    "a counterelectrode beneath the thin film acts as a ground plane .",
    "in order to arrive at quantitative results , we developed a physical model for the system , starting with the simplest case of a uniform bulk sample . because the probe tip length is much less than the wavelength @xmath10 cm , we are able to perform a static calculation@xcite of the microwave electric fields .",
    "cylindrical symmetry further simplifies the problem to two dimensions . because of the complicated geometry of the probe tip in contact with a multi - layered sample",

    "we calculate the potential @xmath11 in the region represented by the grid , taking into account any changes in the permittivity @xmath12 , by solving poisson s equation : @xmath13 using a rectangular grid , we represent the probe tip as a cone with a blunt end of radius @xmath14 ( see fig .

    "we represent the probe sharpness with the aspect ratio parameter @xmath29 .",
    "it is important for the boundaries of the grid to be sufficiently far away in order to minimize the effect of the chosen boundary conditions on the electric field near the probe tip . to accomplish this , outside the dashed box in fig .",
    "[ model_diagram ] , the values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 continuously increase with distance away from the probe tip , allowing the outer radius of the grid to be at least 4 mm , and the height of the grid to be 2 mm .",

    ", we can treat the thin film as the only perturbation to the system .",
    "this perturbation due to the thin film is evident in fig .",

    "the process for quantitative imaging of thin films is as follows .",

    "the results are summarized in table [ sto_bst_table ] .",
    "the thin - film permittivity was also measured at 10 khz using au interdigital electrodes deposited on the films .",

    "the electric field is the strongest , and falls off nearly to zero at the outer boundary of the model grid .",
    "thus , most of the contribution to the integral will come from the region in the sample near the probe tip . for our purposes , we define the lateral spatial resolution to be @xmath65 , where the integral over the volume @xmath66 under the probe tip is equal to half of the integral over the volume of the whole sample . for thin films , the depth @xmath67",
    "is taken to be the thickness of the film , because we assume the substrate to be uniform and therefore not to contribute any features to the dielectric image . for bulk samples ,",

    "we conclude that a cone is a much better approximation for the probe tip than a sphere , at least for the geometry of our system .",
    "we believe that this is due to the long - range nature of electromagnetism , where the potential due to a point charge diminishes at the rate @xmath99 , causing the sides of the cone - shaped tip to have an important contribution to the frequency shift.@xcite figure [ field_image](a ) illustrates this effect , by showing that even at a distance of 6 @xmath0 m from the axis , the electric field is relatively strong at the cone surface .    also , a problem with an analytic solution using a sphere for the tip is the limitation to a single fitting parameter , the sphere radius @xmath92 . for our probe tips , it was not possible to obtain a reasonable fit with the data on a @xmath9 vs.  @xmath59 curve without an additional fitting parameter , such as the radius of a flat area on the sphere ( a geometry which can not be solved analytically ) .",

    "as a result , the presence of the thin - film counterelectrode can be safely ignored in the finite element model described above . because the counterelectrode is immediately beneath the dielectric thin film , the applied electric field is primarily in the vertical direction , unlike the microwave electric field , which is mainly in the horizontal direction for thin films with large permittivies ( fig .",

    "<S> we describe the use of a near - field scanning microwave microscope to image the permittivity and tunability of bulk and thin film dielectric samples on a length scale of about 1 @xmath0 m . </S>",
    "<S> the microscope is sensitive to the linear permittivity , as well as to nonlinear dielectric terms , which can be measured as a function of an applied electric field . we introduce a versatile finite element model for the system , which allows quantitative results to be obtained . we demonstrate use of the microscope at 7.2 ghz with a 370 nm thick ba@xmath1sr@xmath2tio@xmath3 thin film on a laalo@xmath3 substrate . </S>",
    "<S> this technique is nondestructive and has broadband ( 0.1 - 50 ghz ) capability . </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity of the microscope to changes in permittivity is @xmath4 at @xmath5 , while the nonlinear dielectric tunability sensitivity is @xmath6 . </S>"
