    "our universe appears spatially flat and undergoing a period of accelerated expansion . several observational data probe this picture  @xcite but two unrevealed ingredients",
    "are needed in order to achieve this dynamical scenario , namely _ dark matter _ at galactic and extragalactic scales and _ dark energy _ at cosmological scales .",
    "the dynamical evolution of self - gravitating structures can be explained within newtonian gravity , but a dark matter component is required in order to obtain agreement with observations  @xcite .    lately , _ models of extended gravity _",
    "@xcite have been considered as a viable theoretical mechanism to explain cosmic acceleration and galactic rotation curves . in such models",
    "one extends only the geometric sector , without introducing any exotic matter .",
    "such models may result from an effective theory of a quantum gravity formulation , which may contain additional contributions with respect to gr , at galactic , extra - galactic and cosmological scales where , otherwise , large amounts of unknown dark components are required . in the context of _ models of extended gravity _ , one may consider that gravitational interaction acts differently at different scales , whilst the robust results of gr at local and solar system scales are preserved @xcite .",
    "in the so - called weak - field approximation , any relativistic theory of gravitation yields , in general , corrections to the gravitational potentials ( _ e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite ) which , at the newtonian and post - newtonian level , could constitute the test - bed for these theories @xcite .",
    "in fact in etg there are further gravitational degrees of freedom and moreover the form of the gravitational interaction is no longer scale - invariant .",
    "hence , in a given situation , besides the schwarzschild radius , other characteristic gravitational scales could come out from dynamics .",
    "such scales , in the weak field approximation , should exhibit a form of gravitational confinement in this way  @xcite .",
    "models of fourth order gravity have been studied mainly in the newtonian limit ( weak - field and small velocity ) @xcite , as well as in the minkowskian limit  @xcite . in the former one",
    "finds modifications of the gravitational potential , whilst in the latter one obtains massive gravitational wave modes  @xcite .",
    "the weak - field limit of such proposals have to be tested against realistic self - gravitating systems .",
    "galactic rotation curves , stellar hydrodynamics and gravitational lensing appear natural candidates as test - bed experiments  @xcite .",
    "these corrections to the gravitational lagrangian were already considered by several authors  @xcite ) . from a conceptual viewpoint , there is no reason _ a priori _ to restrict the gravitational lagrangian to a linear function of the ricci scalar minimally coupled to matter  @xcite .",
    "in particular , one may consider the generalization of @xmath0 models , where @xmath1 is the ricci scalar , through generic functions containing curvature invariants such as the _ ricci squared _ ( @xmath2 ) or the _ riemann squared _",
    "( @xmath3 ) , which however are not independed due to the gauss - bonnet invariant @xmath4 .",
    "note that the same remark applies to the weyl invariant @xmath5 .",
    "hence , one may add a ( massive propagating ) scalar field coupled to geometry ; this leads to the _ scalar - tensor fourth order gravity_.    a fundamental point of studies is the possibility that etg can be plagued by pathologies , such as the appearance of ghosts ( negative norm states ) , which could allow for negative possibilities and consequently violation of unitarity  @xcite .",
    "in particular , while standard gr and the gauss - bonnet theory have the same field content , this is not the case for the @xmath0 gravity type and weyl gravity .",
    "the former is safe , even though it does not improve the ultraviolet behaviour of the theory ; @xmath0 gravity has just an extra scalar and can be ghost free in its newtonian limit  @xcite .",
    "the latter has an extra pathological spin-2 field , which however causes no problem in the low - energy regime since then the effects of higher order terms give rise to small corrections to gr  @xcite . in our analysis",
    ", we will consider an action motivated from noncommutative geometry within the class of a weyl type gravity . however , as we will discuss this proposal will be considered in the spirit of an effective field theory , hence is free from any pathologies .",
    "our starting point is the spherically symmetric solutions ( in the newtonian limit ) of scalar tensor fourth order gravity , then we study the dynamics of massless scalar field .    in this paper",
    "we try to obtain a new test - bed experiment , even if into a theoretical framework .",
    "we want to consider the casimir effect in the curved space where the metric is given by a modified theory of gravity . generally speaking",
    ", the casimir effect @xcite can be defined as the stress on the bounding surfaces when a quantum field is confined in a finite volume of space .",
    "the confinement of physical field restricts obviously the modes of the corresponding quantum field giving us a measurable macroscopic effects .",
    "the casimir effect has been widley discussed in the flat space @xcite .",
    "they indeed have shown good agreement with the theory .",
    "recently , some authors @xcite have considered the influence of gravitational field on the vacuum energy density of a quantum field inside a cavity .",
    "indeed possible modifications in the vacuum energy induced by gravity could play a relevant role in the dynamics of the universe @xcite .",
    "also , at a microscopic level , casimir energy modification in strong gravitational fields could become relevant in models of quark confinement based in string interquark potentials @xcite . in connection with the equivalence principle",
    "there is a further question : whether vacuum fluctuations do gravitate or not .",
    "finally , the analysis of the possible gravitational effects on casimir cavities faces the open issue concerning the limits of validity of gr at small distances @xcite . in this paper",
    "we perform a perturbative evaluation upto second order of the gravitational corrections to the casimir vacuum energy density for a massless scalar field confined in a cavity in a slightly curved static spacetime background .",

    "<S> we study the casimir vacuum energy density and the casimir pressure for a massless scalar field confined between two nearby parallel plates in a slightly curved , static spacetime background , employing the weak field approximation in the framework of extended theories of gravity ( etg ) . following a perturbative approach upto second order </S>",

    "<S> the corrections to the vacuum energy density in presence of curved spacetime in the framework of general relativity ( gr ) are small and today they are still undetected with the current technology </S>",
