    "we consider networks of biochemical reactions with mass action kinetic laws .",
    "each reaction is defined as @xmath0 the stoichiometric vectors @xmath1 , @xmath2 have coordinates @xmath3 and @xmath4 and define which species are consumed and produced by the reaction @xmath5 and in which quantities .",
    "the mass action law means that reaction rates are monomial functions of the species concentrations @xmath6 and reads @xmath7 where @xmath8 are kinetic constants , @xmath9 are multi - indices and @xmath10 .",
    "the network dynamics is described by the following differential equations @xmath11 in what follows , the kinetic parameters do not have to be known precisely , they are given by their orders of magnitude . a convenient way to represent orders",
    "is by considering that @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a positive parameter much smaller than @xmath14 , @xmath15 is an integer , and @xmath16 has order unity .",
    "an approximate integer order can be obtained from any real positive parameter by @xmath17 where round stands for the closest integer .",
    "for instance , if @xmath18 , @xmath15 will represent the logarithmic value of the parameter rounded to the nearest decade .",
    "notice that in this representation , small quantities have large orders .",
    "furthermore , the smaller @xmath13 , the better the separation between quantities of different orders , indeed @xmath19 if @xmath20 .",
    "we are also interested in the orders of the species concentrations , therefore we introduce a vector of orders @xmath21 , such that @xmath22 .",
    "orders @xmath23 are unknown and have to be calculated . to this aim",
    ", the network dynamics can be described by a rescaled system of ordinary differential equations @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 stands for the vector dot product .",
    "the r.h.s .  of each equation in is a sum of monomials in the concentrations , with positive and negative signs given by the stoichiometries @xmath27 .",
    "generically , these monomials have different orders ( given by @xmath28 ) and there is one monomial that dominates the others . in this case , the corresponding variable will change rapidly in the direction imposed by this dominating monomial . however , on sub - manifolds of the phase space , at least two monomials , one positive and one negative may have the same order .",
    "this situation was called tropical equilibration in  @xcite .",
    "tropical equilibration is different from equilibrium or steady state in many ways .",
    "firstly , steady state means equilibration of all species , whereas tropical equilibration may concern only one or a few rapid species . secondly ,",
    "steady state means that forces are rigorously compensated on all variables that are at rest , whereas tropical equilibration means that only the dominant forces are compensated and variables may change slowly under the influence of uncompensated , weak forces .",
    "compensation of dominant forces constrains the dynamics of the system to a low dimensional manifold named invariant manifold @xcite . as discussed in  @xcite ,",
    "tropical equilibrations encompass the notions of quasi - steady state and quasi - equilibrium from singular perturbation theory of biochemical networks , but are more general .",
    "let us provide a formal definition of tropical equilibration ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "[ eqreactions ] two reactions @xmath5 , @xmath29 are tropically equilibrated on the species @xmath30 iff :    \\i ) @xmath31 ,    \\ii ) @xmath32 ( meaning that the effects of the reactions @xmath5 and @xmath29 on the species @xmath30 are opposite ) ,    \\iii ) @xmath33 for any reaction @xmath34 , such that @xmath35 .    according to and definition  [ eqreactions ] ,",
    "the equilibrations correspond to vectors @xmath36 where the minimum in the definition of the piecewise - affine function @xmath37 is attained at least twice .",
    "tropical equilibrations are used to calculate the unknown orders @xmath23 .",
    "the solutions have a geometrical interpretation .",
    "let us consider the equality @xmath31 .",
    "this represents the equation of a @xmath38 dimensional hyperplane of @xmath39 , orthogonal to the vector @xmath40 :    @xmath41    for each species @xmath30 , we consider the set of reactions @xmath42 that act on this species , namely the reaction @xmath43 is in @xmath42 iff @xmath44 .",
    "the finite set @xmath42 can be characterized by the corresponding set of stoichiometric vectors @xmath45 .",
    "the set of points of @xmath39 where at least two reactions equilibrate on the species @xmath30 corresponds to the places where the function @xmath46 is not locally affine ( the minimum in the definition of @xmath46 is attained at least twice ) . for simplicity",
    ", we shall call this locus tropical manifold @xcite .",
    "a simple example of biochemical network is the michaelis - menten mechanism of an enzymatic reaction .",
    "this network consists of two reactions : @xmath47 where @xmath48 represent the substrate , the enzyme , the enzyme - substrate complex and the product , respectively .",
    "the system of polynomial differential equations reads : @xmath49 where @xmath50 $ ] , @xmath51 $ ] , @xmath52 $ ] , @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "there are two conservation laws : @xmath54 and @xmath55 the rescaled variables are @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "let us notice that the last equation can never be equilibrated because it contains only one monomial .",
    "the tropical equilibration equations for the remaining variables read : @xmath62 the set of integer orders endowed with the minimum and sum operations is a semiring , called min - plus algebra @xcite where the minimum is noted @xmath63 and the sum @xmath64 .",
    "our tropical equilibration problem is solving a set of polynomial equations in this semi - ring .",
    "let us emphasize an important difference between the calculation of tropical equilibrations and calculation of exact equilibria of systems of polynomial differential equations .",
    "if there are exact conservation laws , the set of exact equilibrium equations are linearly dependent , therefore one can eliminate some of them from the system . because elements in a min - plus semiring do not generally have additive inverses , elimination is not automatically possible in systems of tropical equations . in this case , one should keep all the tropical equilibrium equations for all the variables and add to them the tropical conservation relations .",
    "a slightly more complicated network is the goldbeter - koshland mechanism .",
    "this consists of two coupled michaelis - menten equations .",
    "the mechanism is important because it plays the role of a switch , allowing the propagation of information in signal transduction networks .",
    "the detailed mechanism is represented by four mass action reactions    @xmath65    where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are , for instance , the un - phosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of a substrate , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , are kinase and phosphatase enzymes , respectively .",
    "this mechanism leads to the following system of differential equations : @xmath70 where @xmath71 $ ] , @xmath72 $ ] , @xmath73 $ ] , @xmath74 $ ] , @xmath75 $ ] , @xmath76 $ ] .",
    "this system has three conservation laws : @xmath77 equilibrating each equation of and taking into account leads to the following tropical equations : @xmath78    the corresponding csp , described in the next section , is solved instantly and gives the unique solution : @xmath79 for parameter values consistent with the literature : @xmath80 .",
    "given a biochemical reaction system with its mass - action kinetics , and a small @xmath13 , the problem of tropical equilibration is to look for a rescaling of the variables such that the dominating positive and negative term in each ode _ equilibrate _ as per definition  [ eqreactions ] , i.e. , are of the same degree in @xmath13 .",
    "note that there are supplementary constraints related to this rescaling when some conservation laws exist for the original system . finding these conservation laws is another csp which can be solved efficiently with constraint methods @xcite . here",
    "we will assume that the conservation laws are given in input . in our prototype implementation",
    ", both the computation of conservation laws and the following equilibration are performed for a given system .",
    "for each original equation @xmath81 , @xmath82 is introduced a variable @xmath83 that is used to rescale the system by posing @xmath84 .",
    "these are the variables of our csp .",
    "note that they require a solver handling @xmath85 like for instance swi - prolog  @xcite with the ` clpfd ` library by markus triska .",
    "the constraints are of two kinds . for each differential equation that should be equilibrated",
    "is a list of positive monomials @xmath86 , and a list of negative monomials @xmath87 .",
    "the degrees in @xmath13 of all these monomials are integer linear expressions in the @xmath88 .",
    "now , to obtain an equilibration one should enforce for each @xmath30 that the minimum degree in @xmath86 is equal to the minimum degree in @xmath87 .",
    "this will ensure that we find two monomials ( _ i _ of definition  [ eqreactions ] ) of opposite sign ( _ ii _ ) and of minimal degree ( _ iii _ ) .",
    "this corresponds to the first six tropical equations of  .",
    "we will see how they can be implemented with reified constraints , but for now , let us assume a constraint ` min(l , m ) ` that enforces that the fd variable ` m ` is the minimum value of a list ` l ` of linear expressions over fd variables .",
    "we have in our csp , for each @xmath82 , ` min(positivemonomialdegrees , m ) ` and ` min(negativemonomialdegrees , m ) ` .",
    "the second kind of constraint comes from conservation laws .",
    "each conservation law is an equality between a linear combination of the @xmath6 and a constant @xmath89 . by rescaling",
    ", we obtain a sum of rescaled monomials equal to @xmath90 .",
    "we want this equality to hold when @xmath13 goes to zero , which implies that the minimal degree in @xmath13 in the left hand side is equal to ( the round of ) the degree of the right hand side .",
    "since once again the degrees on the left are linear combinations of our variables @xmath88 , this is again a constraint of the form : ` min(conservationlawdegrees , k ) ` where ` k ` is equal to @xmath91 .",
    "this corresponds to the last three tropical equations of  .",
    "furthermore , if the system under study is not at steady state , the minimum degree should not be reached only once , which would lead to a constant value for the corresponding variable when @xmath13 goes to zero , but at least twice .",
    "this is the case for the example treated in  @xcite .",
    "the constraint we need is therefore slightly more general than ` min/2 ` : we need the constraint ` min(l , m , n ) ` which is true if ` m ` is smaller than each element of ` l ` and equal to ` n ` elements of that list .",
    "note that using clp notation , we have :    .... min(m , l ) : -   c#>=1 , min(m , l , c ) . ....    in order to enforce that the minimum is reached at least a required number of times , one obvious solution is to try all pairs of positive and negative monomials and count the successful pairs @xcite .",
    "however , this is not necessary , the ` min(l , m , n ) ` constraint directly expresses the cardinality constraint on the minimums . and can be implemented using _",
    "reified constraints _ to propagate information between ` l ` , ` m ` and ` n ` in all directions , without enumeration .",
    "using swi - prolog notations , the implementation of ` min/3 ` by reified constraints is as follows :    [ source , prolog ] ---- min ( [ ] , _ , 0 ) .",
    "min([h | t ] , m , c ) : - m#=<h , b # < = = > m#=h , c#=b+cc ,                        min(t , m , cc ) . ----    this concise and portable implementation will probably improve when the ` minimum ` and ` min_n ` global constraints are available ( see  @xcite for a reference ) .",
    "however it already proves very efficient as demonstrated in the next section .",
    "to benchmark our approach , we applied it systematically to all the dynamical models of the biomodels repository  @xcite of biological systems , with @xmath13 set arbitrarily to @xmath92 .",
    "we used the latest release ( _ r24 _ from 2012 - 12 - 12 ) which includes 436 curated models .    among them , only 55 models have non - trivial purely polynomial kinetics ( ignoring _ events _ if any ) .",
    "our computational results on those are summarized in the following table , where the first column indicates whether a complete equilibration was found , and the times are in seconds .    [ cols=\">,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "one of the limits of this approach , is that it is not well suited to equilibration problems with an infinite number of solutions . for those ,",
    "symbolic solutions depending on free parameters are necessary , as done in  @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to reduce a system using its conservation laws , and to apply tropical equilibration directly on the reduced system .",
    "however , the resulting equilibrations might be slightly different , apparently due to the possible loss of positivity of certain variables .",
    "we want to investigate this question further .    in many cases",
    ", it makes sense biologically to only look for partial equilibrations .",
    "strategies to decide when such decision has to be made remain unclear .",
    "nevertheless the framework of partial constraint satisfaction and more specifically max - csp  @xcite would allow us to easily handle the maximization of the number of equilibrated variables .     in this paper",
    "we discussed only the calculation of the tropical equilibrations and of the unknown orders of the variables .",
    "once the orders of the variables are known , the rapid variables can be identified and the system reduced to a simpler one .",
    "the details of the reduction procedure , involving pruning of dominated terms and pooling of fast variables into fast cycles will be presented elsewhere .",
    "a simple reduction procedure , involving only pruning is described by theorem 3.6 of @xcite .",
