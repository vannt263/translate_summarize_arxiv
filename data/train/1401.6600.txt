    "time series photometry obtained with space based telescopes  _ most _ ( microvariability and oscillations of stars ; walker et al.2003 ) , _ corot _ ( convection , rotation , and planetary transits ; baglin et al .",
    "2009 ) and kepler  have recently been used to derive very high quality light curves for normal low mass field stars .",
    "those data have provided a wealth of new information on , for example , the size evolution and stability of cold spots on main sequence stars ( silva - valio & lanza 2011 ; walkowicz et al .",
    "2013 ) , the ages of main sequence stars from asteroseismology ( silva aguirre et al .",
    "2013 ) , and the frequency of occurence of planets ( fressin et al . 2013 ) .",
    "these results required the very high quality data achievable from space because the variability amplitudes for these old stars are quite small , and in many cases , the needed cadence and duration to successfully address these topics can not be readily obtained with ground - based data .",
    "very young , pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars are in principle much more favorable targets for time series photometry . in the first place , the amplitudes of variability for young stellar objects ( ysos ) are often much larger , with amplitudes up to a magnitude or more .",
    "in addition , there are many more physical processes that can cause variability in ysos ( variable extinction , variable accretion , flares , very large cold spots , relatively rapid rotation , etc . ) .",
    "the different mechanisms have differing timescales , ranging from hours to weeks .",
    "they also have different spectral signatures , giving impetus to multi - wavelength and spectral monitoring .",
    "the rich variety of phenomena in ysos have motivated ground - based observing campaigns to characterize their variability properties at least for the past half century .    for the past two decades ,",
    "the primary reference for the characterization and interpretation of yso light curves has been herbst et al .",
    "( 1994 ; h94 ) .",
    "h94 sorted yso light curves into four basic types .",
    "class i light curves are periodic and roughly sinusoidal in shape , and result from the rotational modulation of cold , non - axisymmetrically distributed starspots ; stars with class i light curves are typically weak - lined t tauri stars ( wtts ) , though some classical t tauri stars ( ctts ) may also show light curves of this type . class ii light curves",
    "are thought to be the result of variations in the veiling continuum of ctts , and to reflect changes in the size , shape or effective temperature of hot spots on their surfaces due to variations in the accretion rate from their circumstellar disks .",
    "most class iis vary irregularly in time , with no obvious periodicity , but with characteristic timescales less than a few days .",
    "however , a subset of the class iis  designated as class iip  are periodic , presumably due to a dominant hot spot group whose lifetime is long compared to the star s rotation period .",
    "class iii light curves show ( generally ) irregularly spaced flux dips on an otherwise relatively slowly varying quiescent brightness maximum ; these stars generally show little or no veiling in their spectra",
    ". stars with class iii light curves in the h94 sample were all relatively high mass pms stars with spectral types earlier than k2 .",
    "h94 was least certain about the physical mechanism for the class iii light curves , but advocated variable extinction by circumstellar material as the most likely cause .",
    "perhaps the most interesting of these light curve types is the class ii ( and iip ) group , because their properties should provide direct insight into the accretion process .",
    "recent advances in computational astrophysics have made it possible to begin to construct physically realistic 3d magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) models of accretion disks ( kulkarni and romanova 2008 = kr08 ; romanova et al .",
    "2012 = r12 ; mckinney et al .  2012 ; cemeljic et al .",
    "2013 ) . for stars with relatively strong magnetic dipoles ,",
    "these models predict that the accreting gas flows along field lines and impacts the star at nearly free - fall velocities at relatively high latitude , resulting in the stable , long - lived hot spots and predicting light curves that are periodic and approximately sinusoidal ( see figure 7a of kr08 ) .",
    "if one of these  funnel flows \" passes through our line of sight , the infalling warm gas could be the source for variability in the inverse p cygni profiles often seen in the emission line profiles of classical t tauri stars ( kurosawa & romanova 2013 ) .",
    "stars with this type of accretion could plausibly be associated with the class iip light curves of h94 ( as originally suggested by bertout et al .",
    "1988 ) .",
    "other theoretical models predict less well - behaved accretion variability , plausibly better matched to the class ii light curves of h94 .",
    "some 3d mhd model simulations from kr08 exhibit rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) instabilities at the disk - magnetosphere boundary , resulting in many short - lived tongues of matter penetrating between the stellar magnetic field lines .",
    "typically , a few such tongues reach the surface of the star at any one time , producing short - lived hot spots at lower latitudes than for the funnel flows and relatively chaotic looking light curves ( see figure 7b of kr08 ) .",
    "other 3d mhd models show that in some cases magneto - rotational instabilities ( mri ) in the inner circumstellar disk of a yso can lead to highly variable accretion rates and predicted light curve shapes similar to those arising from the rt instabilities ( see figure 6 of r12 ) .",
    "quantitative comparison between these theoretical model light curves and those of actual ysos , particularly for the class iis , is more difficult than it might appear .",
    "that is because the amplitudes predicted for the instability - driven accretion bursts are often only 5 - 10% , and their typical durations are of order a day .",
    "typical ground - based campaigns with one or two epochs per night can detect this type of variability , but does not provide the cadence , regularity or photometric accuracy to accurately measure such features .",
    "higher cadence observations are needed in order to clearly characterize the physical mechanisms .",
    "do the light curves of the majority of real ctts , in fact , look anything like the model predictions ?",
    "if so , what types of quantitative information can be drawn from these light curves  for example , what are the relative frequency of periodic , sinusoidal light curves as would result from stable funnel flows at high latitudes , versus aperiodic , chaotic light curves resulting from rt or mri driven accretion ?",
    "do the aperiodic , chaotic light curves dominate at high accretion rates , as predicted by kr08 ?",
    "are the amplitudes and durations of the observed accretion bursts roughly in accord with the theoretical predictions ?    the first steps towards clarifying how ysos actually accrete using high cadence , space - based monitoring have in fact been published recently .",
    "alencar et al . (",
    "2010 ) provided _ corot _ monitoring for the ysos of ngc 2264 , and suggested that a few of their ctts light curves were likely due to stochastic accretion ( see their fig .",
    "rucinski et al .",
    "( 2008 ) used most to obtain a well - sampled light curve for tw hya , which also showed numerous brief flux excesses that they associated with a variable accretion rate .",
    "a small sample of other bright ysos was also observed with most ( siwak et al .",
    "2011 ; cody et al 2013 ) ; for the ysos with disks in this sample , there was some short timescale variability which could not be attributed to long - lived spots or flares , and which could be evidence for variable accretion .",
    "however , none of these studies were accompanied by simultaneous spectroscopic or multi - wavelength time - series data , which limited the ability to provide conclusive interpretations to the light curves .",
    "we have recently conducted an observational campaign for the star - forming region ngc  2264 designed to have the cadence , duration , precision , wavelength coverage and sensitivity to resolve many of the long - standing issues for characterizing yso variability .",
    "that program is called the coordinated synoptic investigation of ngc  2264 , or csi  2264 .",
    "this campaign was built around 30 + days of continuous , simultaneous monitoring by three space telescopes  _ corot _ ( baglin et al .",
    "2009 ) , most ( walker et al .",
    "2003 ) , and _",
    "( werner et al .  2004 ) . here ,",
    "we report one result from that campaign : the empirical identification of a set of ysos whose light curves are best explained as being dominated by short - timescale variations in the star s accretion rate . we demonstrate that these stars include the most actively accreting members of ngc  2264 .",
    "cody et al .  ( 2014 ) provide a detailed description of all of the optical and infrared ( ir ) observational data we have obtained for the young stars in ngc  2264 and our basic data reduction procedures .",
    "that paper also provides an overview of the light curve morphologies we find for the ctts in the cluster .",
    "readers are referred to that paper for specific details concerning the observations . here",
    "we provide just a brief synopsis of the observations in order to provide the context necessary for our discussion .",
    "_ spitzer _ s infrared array camera , irac ( fazio et al .  2004 ) was used as part of the csi  2264 program ( program i d 80040 , pi : j.stauffer ) to observe ngc  2264 nearly continuously from december 3 , 2011 to january 1 , 2012 . in the first week of that period",
    ", approximately four days were spent in  staring mode \" where the telescope was pointed to a position near ngc  2264-irs-1 ( i.e. , near the center of the spokes cluster ; teixeira et al .",
    "2006 ) and repeated frames were taken at that position for blocks of 19 - 26 hours without interruption .",
    "the integration time for each exposure was 4.4 seconds .",
    "the two irac fields of view are separated on the sky by about seven arcminutes , so we collect these light curves for one set of 283 stars in channel 1 ( 3.6 microns ) , and for a disjoint set of 249 stars in channel 2 ( 4.5 microns ) .",
    "the relative photometric accuracy for these light curves approaches 1 mmag for stars that are bright but not saturated . for the remaining observing time within the csi  2264 program , _ spitzer _ observations of ngc  2264 were done in mapping mode , where a rectangular region centered near @xmath306 40 45.0,+09 40 ( 2000 ) and about 45@xmath4 by 40@xmath4 in size was observed about twelve times per day , with a total integration time of about 40 seconds per point on the sky . for one or two of these maps each day , the data were taken in high - dynamic range ( hdr ) mode , resulting also in data with 1.6 second total integration time .",
    "these data provide typical 1-@xmath5 uncertainties of about 0.01 mag for sufficiently bright stars .",
    "most stars have light curves in both channels , but stars near the edge of the map may have data in only one channel .",
    "the _ corot _ camera has a field of view in excess of one square degree , which is larger than the physical extent of ngc  2264 .",
    "however , only stars included within an input catalog have their photometry downlinked to the ground , and these stars must satisfy brightness , crowding and nebular background constraints . in total , about 490 probable cluster members and more than a thousand likely field stars were included in the input catalog for the december 2011 observing campaign .",
    "data were obtained from mjd 55896.8 through mjd 55935.5 , with only a brief interruption around mjd 55917 due to a telescope pointing problem . for most stars ,",
    "the photometry is provided at a cadence of 512 seconds ; for a small subset of the stars , data are provided at 32 second cadence .",
    "while there is no hard limit , stars fainter than r = 16.5 were generally excluded from the target list in order to allow reasonably good signal - to - noise for the _ corot _ light curves .    in principle , _ corot _ can provide multi - color light curves for some of the observed stars .",
    "however , for our purposes , we have only utilized the `` white light '' data .",
    "_ corot _ s bandpass is essentially a broad @xmath6 filter .",
    "the _ corot _",
    "data are sky - subtracted aperture photometry which have been run through a pipeline designed to mitigate artifacts that are present in the downlinked data ( samadi et al .",
    "2006 ) . in some cases",
    ", jumps in the photometry are still present even after this pipeline has been run .",
    "when possible , we have removed these jumps manually ; in other cases where the jumps are less obvious , we have left the data `` as is . ''",
    "the flux rms over 512 seconds in the light curves at @xmath7 = 12 is typically about 0.002 , increasing to about 0.015 at @xmath7 = 16 .    a 20 day _",
    "_ `` short run '' for ngc  2264 was also obtained in march 2008 ( alencar et al .",
    "light curves for many of the ctts members were also obtained in that campaign , and we use those data where relevant .",
    "we obtained high - resolution spectra of most of the ngc  2264 members using either hectochelle on the multiple mirror telescope ( mmt ; szentgyorgyi et al .",
    "2011 ) or the flames multi - object spectrograph on the very large telescope ( vlt ; pasquini et al .",
    "the hectochelle spectra have been discussed previously in furesz et al.(2006 ) ; the observations were obtained in 2004 and 2005 , have a resolution of about 34,000 , and cover the spectral range 6460 - 6650  . in general ,",
    "no sky background has been subtracted from these profiles , which can leave narrow emission cores from the region at the cluster rest velocity in the stellar spectra .",
    "the flames spectra were obtained with ut2 at the vlt , using the hr15n grating , producing a resolution of about 17,000 , and covering the spectral range 6375 - 6815  .",
    "only six of the stars that are the focus of this paper have flames spectra , but for those stars we have up to 22 spectra , with usually five or six of them obtained during the time period when _ corot _ was obtaining photometry of the cluster ( and the others being obtained within about 60 days following the _ corot _ observations ) .",
    "spectroscopic rotational velocities ( @xmath8 ) for many of the ngc  2264 members are available from either baxter et al.(2009 ) or from our analysis of the vlt / flames spectra .",
    "we also use a variety of broad and narrow band photometry of ngc  2264 members in order to measure the ultraviolet ( uv ) excesses of the ysos and thereby identify those that are actively accreting matter from their circumstellar disks , and to measure their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and thereby characterize the ir excesses from their disks .",
    "the uv excess determinations are made using @xmath9 photometry obtained in 2010 and 2012 with the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) megacam ( venuti et al .  2014 ) .",
    "the broad - band photometry used for the sed fits comes from a variety of sources , but is primarily reported in either rebull et al .",
    "( 2002 ) or sung et al.(2009 ) .",
    "cold spots on the photosphere , clumps or warps in the inner disk that occult our line of sight , and companions that transit our line of sight to the primaries all produce light curves with periodic signals .",
    "these types of variables have been found in abundance by previous ground - based surveys of star - forming regions ( rebull et al .",
    "2002 ; lamm et al .",
    "2004 = l04 ; herbst et al .",
    "1994 and 2000 ; stassun et al .  1999 ; grankin et al .",
    "2007 ; etc . ) .",
    "as long as the duration of the monitoring period is long enough , and the period is sufficiently stable , one can make up for the relative sparseness of the sampling and the interruptions by weather in these ground surveys by folding the light curve at the identified period .",
    "we also find these types of variables in our data , and we provide an initial summary of their prevalence and characteristics in cody et al .",
    "( 2014 ) and affer et al .",
    "rotation periods derived from the 2008 _ corot _ ngc  2264 observations are reported in affer et al .",
    "( 2013 ) .",
    "types of variability that are not periodic ( e.g. , the class ii variables of h94 ) are much harder to identify and characterize using ground - based photometric monitoring data .",
    "the most extensive ground - based photometric monitoring campaign conducted for the ysos of ngc  2264 was that of l04 .",
    "those authors obtained 88 epochs of @xmath10 band photometry for about 600 cluster members , plus additional candidate members and field stars , during an approximately 40 day campaign .",
    "roughly 400 of these stars , primarily weak - lined ttauri stars ( wtts ) , were identified as periodic variables and 180 stars , primarily ctts , as irregular variables .",
    "l04 surmised that in most cases the irregular variability could be attributed to  variable mass accretion resulting in hot spots which are not stable in brightness , size and location over a few rotation periods .",
    "\" however , the small number of epochs and irregular cadence did not allow further elucidation of the physical nature of the variability .",
    "we have examined our data , and find that only 39 of the l04 irregular variables have _ corot _ light curves ; the overlap is not better primarily because the l04 survey went considerably deeper than the _ corot _ data .",
    "twenty of the thirty - nine stars in common with l04 stars have light curves that are heterogeneous in their properties and where more than one physical mechanism may contribute significantly to the light curve shape .",
    "however , for the other half , the light curves fall into two dominant light curve types .",
    "ten of the stars have light curves characterized as having a more or less stable light maximum interspersed with well - defined flux dips . based on our previous experience with these types of light curves ( bouvier et al.2007 ; alencar et al .",
    "2010 ) , we believe that the flux dips in these stars are due to periods of enhanced extinction , as for the class iii variables of h94 ; in some cases , the flux dips occur approximately periodically and may be due to an inner disk warp passing through our line of sight ( terquem & papaloizou 2000 ) .",
    "nine other stars , however , have light curves that appear roughly similar to each other but are dominated by short duration flux bursts , which we believe are the stars with variable mass accretion which l04 had hoped to identify .",
    "these nine light curves appear reasonably similar to those predicted by kr08 or romanova et al .",
    "( 2012 ) for instability - driven accretion .",
    "figure  [ fig : sixctts ] shows _ corot _ light curves for three stars from each of these two classes .",

    "events such as those shown in figure  [ fig : sixctts]d - f and in the appendix ( figure  [ fig : allcorotlcs ] ) are not present amongst the field stars .",
    "they are also not present , with one or two possible exceptions , amongst the ngc  2264 members that do not have accretion disks nor strong emission lines ( i.e. , among the wtts ) .",
    "for a few of the stars in table  [ tab : basicinformation ] , we have four days of high - cadence irac data simultaneous with a portion of the _ corot _ light curves . figure  [ fig : spitzercorot ] overplots the irac and _ corot _ light curves for two of these stars .",
    "the close correspondence between the two sets of data provides strong confirmation of the reality of the flux bursts .",
    "as we show in section 4 , based on their @xmath9 photometry , the stars of table  [ tab : basicinformation ] all have uv excesses indicative of active accretion .",
    "more significantly , for the set of ngc  2264 ysos for which we have _ corot _ light curves , more than half of the stars with the largest uv excesses are included in table  [ tab : basicinformation ] .      the light curves shown in figure  [ fig : sixctts]d - f are good at illustrating the existence of the flux bursts .",

    "we note for completeness the following .",
    "many stellar flares are detected amongst the ngc  2264 _ corot _ light curves , particularly among the wtts .",
    "these are usually distinguishable from the accretion bursts because of their shorter timescales of generally @xmath121 hour and their characteristic very short rise time and relatively slow decay .",
    "only about a half dozen likely flares are identifiable in the _ corot _ light curves of the stars in table  [ tab : basicinformation ] .",
    "ten of the stars in table  [ tab : basicinformation ] have _ corot _ light curves from both 2008 and 2011 .",
    "based on examination of the light curves , for six of the stars ( mon-000007 , 341 , 945 , 996 , 1022 , and 1174 ) we would classify them as members of the accretor class at both epochs .",
    "mon-000185 appears to have a similar character at both epochs , but none of the bursts in 2011 have an amplitude @xmath135% , and therefore we would not classify that light curve as burst - dominated .",
    "two of the stars ( mon-000011 and 510 ) were identified as accretors based on their 2011 light curves , but have more complicated light curves in 2008 . however , each of those stars have a number of flux bursts in the 2008 data , thereby indicating that the same mechanism dominating the 2011 light curves was also present in 2008 . the only star with a much different light curve morphology at the two epochs",
    "is mon-001573 , which had an approximately sinusoidal light curve characteristic of a spotted star in 2008 and an accretion burst dominated light curve in 2011 .",
    "the stars in table  [ tab : basicinformation ] were identified as having unusually active accretion solely on the basis of their light curve morphology .",
    "if that identification is correct , it seems likely that their other observable characteristics such as ir and uv excesses and balmer emission line profiles should also be distinctive .",
    "we now show that is indeed the case .    for the remainder of this section , we will compare the ysos in table  [ tab : basicinformation ] to two other sets of ysos in ngc  2264 .",
    "the first of these are 81 wtts , identified on the basis of their having stable , sine - wave shaped , periodic light curves typical of cold spots ( class i light curves of h94 ) , and small h@xmath2 equivalent widths ( we subsequently verified they also do not have ir excesses ) .",
    "these wtts are expected not to have actively accreting circumstellar disks and hence little or no uv excesses .",
    "the second group are 26 stars whose _ corot _ light curves show periodic or aperiodic flux dips which we believe are best ascribed to variable extinction ( class iii light curves of h94 ) . the stars in figure  [ fig : sixctts]a - c are members of this variable extinction group .",
    "these stars must have disks if our interpretation of their flux dips is valid .",
    "the ngc 2264 stars that fall into these two light curve classes , particularly the variable extinction class , are discussed further in cody et al .",

    "the majority of them have uv excesses , but of comparatively small degree , and a significant number of them have essentially no uv excess .",
    "panel ( d ) indicates , not unexpectedly , that stars with large h@xmath2  equivalent widths also usually have large uv excesses . among the stars with large h@xmath2 equivalent widths and no _ corot _ data are likely many more stars with light curves like those in table  [ tab : basicinformation ] . converting the uv excesses to a mass accretion rate following the prescription of venuti et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , the mean accretion rate for the stars of table  [ tab : basicinformation ] is @xmath16 m@xmath17 yr@xmath18 and that for the variable extinction group of stars is @xmath19 m@xmath17 yr@xmath18 .",
    "the red solid line in figure  [ fig : colorcolorf4 ] serves as an arbitrary but reasonable boundary below which are found the _",
    "stars with the largest uv excesses in ngc  2264 .",
    "fourteen of the twenty - six ysos falling below that line are included in table  [ tab : basicinformation ] .",
    "the light curves for the other twelve stars are provided in figure  [ fig : bigexcesses ] .",
    "one of these stars ( mon-000273 ) is only slightly variable , and it is difficult to characterize the features that are present given their low amplitude relative to the noise fluctuations . another star ( mon-000423 ) has several jumps or gaps in its light curve , also making it difficult to separate real features from artifacts . of the remaining ten , five have light curves that could be interpreted as being dominated by short - duration flux bursts ( mon-000766 , mon-000893 , mon-001061 , mon-000168 , and mon-001048 ) ; we did not include them in table  [ tab : basicinformation ] because either their continuum level is poorly defined or the noise level is too high .",
    "depending on the interpretation of these five stars , stars with burst - dominated light curves comprise at least 55% and possibly up to @xmath1180% of the ysos with large uv excesses and useful _",
    "_ light curves .",
    "only one of the stars from figure  [ fig : bigexcesses ] ( mon-001132 ) has a light curve shape which could correspond to a hot spot with lifetime long compared to the rotation period , as predicted for the funnel - flow accretion models of kr08 . that burst - dominated light curves would dominate over stable hot spot light curves from funnel - flow accretion at high accretion rates was one of the predictions of kr08 ; h94 had also found this to be true in their sample of ysos .",
    "if the stars of table  [ tab : basicinformation ] have accretion - dominated light curves , it must also be true that they should have ir seds that indicate the presence of warm dust in their inner circumstellar disks .",

    "teixeira et al .  (",
    "2012 ) have constructed theoretical models to predict the ir colors of ysos in the @xmath20 vs.  @xmath21 $ ] diagram , showing that the disk population is expected to form a narrow band of stars stretching to the right ( as observed ) .",

    "nearly all of the stars of table  [ tab : basicinformation ] have colors corresponding to class ii ysos .",
    "the variable extinction stars have ir colors that are significantly less red on average than the table  [ tab : basicinformation ] stars , with nearly half of them falling blueward of the class ii locus .",
    "several of the variable extinction class members have disk colors consistent with classification as transition or pre - transition disks ( espaillat et al .",
    "espaillat et al .",
    "( 2012 ) showed that the accretion rates of transition and pre - transition disks are lower than for normal class ii ysos , in accord with our finding that the mean accretion rate of the variable extinction group as estimated from their uv excesses is relatively low .",
    "one of the defining characteristics of ctts is that they show strong emission lines in their optical spectra . at high spectral resolution ,",
    "the shapes of these emission lines are often quite complex , with blue - shifted and/or red - shifted absorption components and asymmetries ( reipurth et al .",
    "1996 = r96 ; alencar and basri 2000 = ab00 ) .",
    "it is expected that these profile shapes encode information on the kinematics of the gas ( infall of accreting gas ; outflow of gas from stellar and disk winds ) and geometry of the system and our view angle to it .",
    "we have h@xmath2 profiles for a large fraction of the stars in table  [ tab : basicinformation ] , though for most stars the spectra are from 2004/2005 .",
    "we use these spectra here to help further compare the stars of table  [ tab : basicinformation ] with other ctts and thereby to illuminate their physical nature .",
    "we also discuss whether the non - simultaneity of the spectra and photometry significantly reduces the utility of the mmt h@xmath2  data . throughout the discussion",
    ", we primarily reference the theoretical models of ctts magnetospheres and disk winds of kurosawa et al .",

    "figure  [ fig : halphaprofiles ] shows the h@xmath2 profiles for twenty of the stars in table  [ tab : basicinformation ] . in all but two cases , mon-000945 and 996 ,",
    "the spectra are from the mmt in 2004/2005 ( furesz et al .",
    "the spectral resolution is about 34,000 and the flux scale has been normalized so that the continuum level near h@xmath2 has been set to 1.0 .",
    "the mmt spectra have not been sky subtracted , which can lead to spurious narrow emission features at rest velocity from nebular emission .",
    "this is only a significant issue for mon-000260 , where the central peak in figure  [ fig : halphaprofiles ] may appear much stronger than it really is ( see also figure  [ fig : halpha2004 - 2012 ] ) .",
    "equivalent widths from the literature for these stars are reported in table  [ tab : basicinformation ] .",
    "we first address the issue of the non - simultaneity of the mmt spectra and the _ corot _ light curves . in figure",
    "[ fig : halpha2004 - 2012 ] of the appendix , for the five stars where we have both mmt and vlt flames spectra , we compare the 2004/2005 h@xmath2  profiles to the ensemble of profiles from the vlt ( the dashed lines are individual nightly spectra ; the solid line is the average of all vlt epochs ) . for four of the five stars ,",
    "the vlt h@xmath2  profiles are relatively stable during the 2011 campaign , and also are consistent with the shape of the profile as observed in 2004/2005 . only for mon-000260",
    "is the mmt profile outside the range of the profile shapes shown in 2011 , but even then the difference is relatively small ; the ratio of the height of the blue peak to that of the red peak is significantly less than 0.5 for the mmt profile but significantly more than 0.5 for the vlt profiles .",
    "this may reflect a real change , or as noted previously , it could be due to nebular emission affecting the mmt red peak . for a qualitative discussion , we therefore believe that use of the 2004/2005 mmt data should be adequate for our purposes .",
    "the h@xmath2 profiles of figure  [ fig : halphaprofiles ] are typical of ctts , but only sample a relatively small fraction of the total range of profile types shown by ctts ( eg . r96 or ab00 ) .",
    "most of the profiles can best be described as lumpy , broad and centrally peaked , corresponding to type i profiles of the r96 scheme .",
    "nearly all of the other stars have blue - shifted absorption features , with profile types of either ii - b ( b / r peak ratio between 0.5 and 1 ) or iii - b ( b / r peak ratio less than 0.5 ) . to illustrate the relatively small range of profile types amongst the table  [ tab : basicinformation ] stars , figure  [ fig : halphaextinction ] provides the h@xmath2 profiles of the stars with transient extinction dips in their light curves as previously discussed in relation to figures [ fig : colorcolorf4 ] and [ fig : colorcolorf5 ] .",
    "many of these profiles are much more complex than the table  [ tab : basicinformation ] stars , with a third having red - shifted absorption features ( profile type ii - r and iii - r ) and none having the deep , highly blue - shifted absorption features normally ascribed to disk or stellar winds ( as seen particularly for mon-000469 , 567 , and 1022 for the accretors ) .",
    "khs06 explicitly compared their model profiles to the r96 h@xmath2   classification scheme .",
    "they concluded that the type iii - b profiles must have quite high accretion rates ( @xmath25 m@xmath17 yr@xmath18 ) and are most likely for systems seen at relatively low inclination angle .",
    "the stars with type iii - b profiles are marked with blue plus signs in figure  [ fig : colorcolorf4]b , confirming that they indeed all do have quite large uv excesses and hence presumably quite large accretion rates .",
    "the type i profiles require lower , but still significant , accretion rates with little constraint on the inclination angle .",
    "the type iii - r profiles found among some of the stars with variable extinction light curves generally requires lower accretion rates ( @xmath26 m@xmath17 yr@xmath18 or less ) and very high inclination angles .",
    "the high inclination angle requirement is in good agreement with the physical model for producing the flux dips in the aa tau light curves , and the weak uv and ir excesses for these stars also agrees with the prediction of a lower accretion rate expected to match their h@xmath2 profiles .",
    "the khs06 model profiles were calculated for stars with stable , funnel - flow accretion , and so conclusions derived from those models do not necessarily apply to our stars which appear to have more stochastic accretion .",
    "however , model balmer - series emission profiles for stochastic accretors have recently been published by kurosawa et al .",
    "( 2013 ) . based on those models , the h@xmath2  profiles for funnel - flow and instability driven accretion",
    "appear qualitatively the same , with the primary difference being that the red - shifted absorption dips , if present , should be periodic in the former case but aperiodic in the latter case . because we generally only have a single epoch h@xmath2  profile",
    ", we can not test this prediction for the stars of table  [ tab : basicinformation ] .",
    "in addition to the h@xmath2  profiles , the high resolution spectroscopy we have provides us with an additional means to characterize the stars of table  [ tab : basicinformation ] and compare them to other ngc  2264 ctts . in particular , we can measure photospheric veiling and veiling variability ( bertout 1984 ; hartmann and kenyon 1990 ) .",
    "the strong uv excesses in ctts , which we have shown to be especially true for the stars of table  [ tab : basicinformation ] , is usually attributed to photons ( a combination of black body and free - free / bound - free emission ) from the hot gas created when the accreting gas strikes the stellar surface . while the contrast of this emission relative to the photospheres of ctts is greatest in the uv , it is still present in the vlt / flames spectral bandpass .",
    "the effect is both to add a slowly varying blue continuum to the light from the photosphere , but also in some cases to add emission cores to some of the absorption lines ; both effects result in weaker mean absorption line equivalent widths in ctts compared to stars with purely photospheric spectra ( petrov et al.2011 ) .",
    "this is normally quantified with a parameter called the veiling factor , @xmath27 in order to provide a mean veiling index for the six stars from table  [ tab : basicinformation ] for which we have vlt spectra , we have coadded all available spectra from the 2011 - 2012 campaign , corresponding to usually 15 to 22 epochs .",
    "we have then measured the equivalent widths for the seven strongest and least blended absorption lines in each of those spectra ( at 6448.9 , 6461.6 , 6470.7 , 6624.7 , 6707.8 and 6717.7 - the latter two being lii and cai ) , and done the same for a set of wtts of the same spectral type for which we also have vlt spectra .",
    "the derived veiling factors at @xmath286500 @xmath29  for the accretion burst stars are provided in table  [ tab : basicinformation ] ; based on the scatter in the results for individual absorption features , the typical rms uncertainty in these values is about 0.1 . while significant , the derived veiling factors are not huge  a characteristic value of 0.65 means that the veiling continuum at 6600   is 65% of the photospheric continuum , or equivalently that 39% of the total continuum at 6600   is non - photospheric .",
    "we can use the individual spectra obtained during december 2011 when _ corot _ was observing the cluster to look for a correlation between the spectral veiling and the broad - band optical flux .",

    "4d , but in most cases below the wtt locus .",
    "therefore , they are probably accreting but at a low rate ; their light curve shape could be due either to cold or hot spots . in any event",
    ", they reinforce the conclusion that stable , funnel - flow accretion - when present - is likely only to occur for stars with low accretion rates .",
    "previous synoptic photometric surveys of star - forming regions have provided many useful results constraining the physical properties of ysos .",
    "however , ours is the first such survey to have the necessary cadence , sensitivity , duration , wide - field and multi - band nature to unmask the dominant modes by which ysos accrete gas from their circumstellar disk .",
    "our study has also benefited from having high - quality , multi - wavelength photometry from @xmath48 to 24 @xmath37 m for most of the ngc  2264 members , and high - resolution spectroscopy at least at h@xmath2 , also for a large fraction of the stars of interest .    using the @xmath0 , @xmath1 two - color diagram to identify the most actively accreting ysos in ngc  2264 , we have shown that amongst the ysos in ngc 2264 with the largest uv excesses , the dominant lightcurve signature is short duration accretion bursts as exemplified by the stars of table  [ tab : basicinformation ] .",
    "usually these accretion bursts occur in a seemingly stochastic pattern at least over 40 day timescales ; however , for a small fraction of the stars , the accretion bursts are clumped together , with the clumps recurring at a period which is plausibly the rotation period of the star . based on theoretical models , at lower accretion rates we expected to find other accreting stars with long - lived high latitude hot spots ( from funnel - flow accretion ) whose light curves",
    "would more closely resemble the spotted light curves of wtts .",
    "we do find a set of candidate stable hot - spot light curves which may correspond to this prediction , but we do not have sufficient data to confirm that hot rather than cold spots are responsible for their variability .",
    "the two most frequent light curve types among the ctts with significant uv excesses are the accretion burst group and the variable extinction group .",
    "the latter consists of stars with periodic flux dips ( aa tau analogs ) and stars with similar flux dips but no obvious periodicity ; in both cases , the flux dips are likely associated with transient structures in their inner circumstellar disk . by their nature , the variable extinction stars must have their disks oriented at relatively large inclination angles to our line of sight .",
    "however , we have also discovered several other physical properties which distinguish the two groups .",
    "based on their spatial locations , the variable extinction stars appear to be , on average , older than the accretion burst stars . the variable extinction stars also have smaller uv and ir excesses , perhaps reflective of their greater age .",
    "the h@xmath2  profiles of the accretion burst group are , for the most part , centrally peaked and modestly structured , with the most common additional feature being blue - shifted absorption troughs .",
    "the h@xmath2  profiles of the variable extinction group are significantly more structured , with about a quarter showing red - shifted absorption troughs .",
    "when we have the appropriate data , the accretion burst stars all have hei 6678 in emission , whereas the stars with variable extinction generally show an absorption feature , presumably due to fei , at that wavelength .    using the normal cadence _",
    "data , the typical total durations for isolated accretion bursts amongst the stars of table  [ tab : basicinformation ] are about one day , as predicted by the models of r12 . however , for the one star from table  [ tab : basicinformation ] where we have much higher cadence _",
    "data , we identify many shorter duration , low amplitude bursts that we believe are also best explained as accretion bursts , with total durations as small as a few hours . for at least this one star , which has a much earlier spectral type than the other stars with burst - dominated light curves ,",
    "the burst distribution function is dominated by these small bursts .",
    "for the six stars from table  [ tab : basicinformation ] for which we have vlt spectra and therefore can estimate veiling , we find that only a small fraction of the @xmath7-band excess light that arises from hot gas can be attributed to the directly identifiable bursts",
    ". this could indicate that most of the accretion flux arises from a large number of short duration , low amplitude bursts ( a hypothesis reminiscent of the debate over whether nano and microflares power the coronae of low mass stars ",
    "hudson 1991 ; tajfirouze & safari 2012 .",
    "while we display light curves for small subsets of ngc  2264 ctts in the main body of the text , we believe it is important to provide light curves for the full set of stars we have discussed .",
    "the next three figures provide the full light curves for all of the stars identified as having burst - dominated light curves , plus light curves for the stars with the most extreme uv excesses whose light curves were not identified as being burst - dominated ( see  4 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : allcorotlcs ] provides the _ corot _ light curves for all stars from table  [ tab : basicinformation ] .",
    "where we have data from both epochs , we show the light curve that best illustrates the accretion burst class .",

    "corot _ and _ spitzer _ data .",
    "the center of the @xmath49-axis scale is set to the median magnitude for each band ; the range in @xmath49 is the same for each of the bands that are shown ( for example , if the _ corot _",
    "@xmath49-axis scale was from 14.6 to 14.0 , and the [ 3.6 ] median magnitude were 10.7 , then the _ spitzer _ @xmath49-axis scale would run from 11.0 to 10.4 ) .",

    "for that reason , we primarily show hectochelle data in figure  [ fig : halphaprofiles ] .",
    "the mmt data were obtained six or seven years prior to our light curves ; we would prefer to be able to show h@xmath2 profiles obtained during our photometric monitoring campaign . for six of the stars of table  [",
    "tab : basicinformation ] , we have such spectra from the vlt / flames spectrograph ( generally , six of the vlt spectra were obtained during the _ corot _ monitoring campaign , with the other fourteen spectra obtained during january and february 2012 ) .",
    "five of those six stars also have mmt h@xmath2  profiles .",
    "we can use those five stars to address the extent to which the h@xmath2  profiles change on both long and short - term timescales , and therefore the utility of using the profile shapes from 2004/2005 to help interpret the 2011 light curves . figure  [ fig : halpha2004 - 2012 ] provides this comparison .",

    "this comparison set is composed of stars whose _ corot _ light curves have prominent flux dips in either 2008 or 2011 . in some cases ,",
    "these are aa tau analogs , where the flux dips are generally broad and structured and occur approximately periodically . in other cases ,",
    "the flux dips do not seem to show any obvious periodicity , and we suspect the variable extinction arises from some type of disk instability . in most cases ,",
    "the light curves outside the dips shows a relatively constant continuum level . assuming these flux dips are due to portions of the circumstellar disk passing through our line of sight , which is the standard model , these stars must be viewed at relatively high inclination .",
    "we have either mmt hectochelle or vlt spectra of most of the stars that fall into this category .",

    "compared to the h@xmath2 profiles of the accretion burst group shown in figure  [ fig : halphaprofiles ] , it is apparent that the variable extinction group often have red - shifted absorption dips in their profiles , which are completely absent from the accretion burst group .",
