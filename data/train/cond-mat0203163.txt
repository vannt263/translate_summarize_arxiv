    "<S> large - scale molecular dynamics simulations are performed to predict the structural and thermodynamic properties of liquid krypton using a potential energy function based on the two - body potential of aziz and slaman plus the triple - dipole axilrod - teller ( at ) potential . by varying the strength of </S>",

    "<S> significant advances have been made when it has been demonstrated @xcite that the static structure factor @xmath0 at small wave - number , @xmath1 , is directly related to the long range part of the effective potential between pairs of atoms . </S>",
    "<S> it was therefore recognized that precise measurements of @xmath0 could provide a direct observation of the details of the interactions . during the past few years </S>",
    "<S> , high precision experiments @xcite , performed in the range @xmath2 nm@xmath3 using small angle neutron scattering facilities , have confirmed the presence of an additional interaction at large distance that can be associated to a three - body contribution at least for kr @xcite and xe @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> long range interactions in noble gases arising from induced dipoles are known as the london dispersion forces @xcite , and are expected to behave as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the interatomic distance . </S>",
    "<S> quantum electromagnetic effects acting at very large separations @xcite , called retardation effects , are described by the casimir - polder potential @xcite , which is expected to fall off as @xmath6 and to have a negligibly small influence @xcite on @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> it is not surprising that a simple lennard - jones ( 12 - 6 ) potential is a satisfactory effective pair potential at first sight since it can be seen as including mean effects coming from the different dipole - dipole , multipole - multipole as well as higher order terms . </S>",
    "<S> however , a better understanding of the interactions lies in a careful examination of the various genuine contributions of the multipole expansion , which contains two - body @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 terms , etc . , as well as </S>",
    "<S> irreducible three - body contributions such as @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , etc . , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the dipole and quadrupole moment , respectively . according to barker and henderson @xcite , four and more  body terms are very small and can be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> the two - body potential of noble gases is often taken in the very accurate hartree - fock - dispersion form propounded by aziz and slaman @xcite , while three - body dispersion effects are often represented by the @xmath10 term in the form given by axirod and teller @xcite that represents the major contribution . </S>",
    "<S> the other three - body contributions mentioned above , which can be modelled by the expressions of bell @xcite , are known to have a small influence although it is not clear whether the agreement with the experiment could be improved when these are taken into account . at high densities , beside dispersion terms , three - body overlap contributions such as exchange effects may come into play @xcite .    it is tempting to consider an effective three - body potential of the axirod - teller @xcite ( at ) form @xmath16 to take all these three - body contributions into account by modifying the strength @xmath17 to include them empirically . in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqat ] ) @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote , respectively , the angles at vertex @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath1 of the triangle ( @xmath23 ) with sides @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> usually , the at potential is designed to represent the @xmath10 contribution only with a value @xmath27 j nm@xmath28 as prescribed by leonard and barker @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such an effective three - body potential was recently used to study the liquid - vapor phase equilibria of argon @xcite as well as the small-@xmath1 part of the static structure factor of krypton in the dense liquid @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , to interpret correctly their experimental data , guarini _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite have increased the strength @xmath17 by 65 % , indicating that other three - body contributions play an important role . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , in a recent work @xcite , we have shown that the missing contributions would have the effect of slightly reducing the strength of the at potential . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , these studies are not completely conclusive since calculations where carried out within the integral equations theory , in which the three - body contribution has to be treated as an approximate state - dependent effective pair potential @xcite , which is not unique .    </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this article is to analyze the influence of the three - body interactions taken in the form of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqat ] ) , to decide what is the effective value of the strength @xmath17 for an accurate description of liquid kr . </S>",
    "<S> three different situations are considered by varying @xmath17 : a value of @xmath29 that corresponds to the pure two - body potential given by aziz and slaman @xcite , a value of @xmath30 representing only the @xmath31 contribution , and a value @xmath32 which is believed to reproduce the critical parameters of kr within 1 % @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> changing the strength of the at potential is a convenient means to measure of the departure from the @xmath10 term and , by comparison with the experiments , could provide useful information on the contribution coming from all other three - body terms that are omitted in the modelling of the interaction between kr atoms . </S>",
    "<S> this work represents an extension to the liquid phase of our preceding studies on kr in the gaseous phase @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for a given interaction model , we carry out molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations to determine @xmath0 as well as the internal energy and the virial pressure . in this context </S>",
    "<S> , md is a powerful method @xcite since the three - body interactions can be tackled without incurring the shortcomings of the approximate integral equations . as a matter of fact , the treatment of the three - body potential ( [ eqat ] ) is not subject to arbitrariness since the resulting forces are derived in an exact manner @xcite , as for the two - body ones .    in order to extract a meaningful structure factor @xmath0 from the md simulations , </S>",
    "<S> the pair correlation @xmath33 is the key quantity that has to be calculated as precisely as possible . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we have performed large - scale md in the sense that ( i ) a large enough simulation cell has been considered so that @xmath33 has a sufficient spatial extension to yield a correct @xmath0 by fourier transform , especially at low @xmath1 , and ( ii ) a large  number of time steps are produced in order to get a significant part of the phase space trajectory , essential for the statistics . as three - body forces </S>",
    "<S> are involved , this represents a huge amount of computer time , and we have used a parallel algorithm described in some details in a previous work @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> simulations with the different values of @xmath17 in the at potential have been performed in the microcanonical ( @xmath34 ) ensemble with a time step @xmath35 s using @xmath36 particles in a cubic cell subject to the standard boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the cutoff radius of the interactions is @xmath37 , where @xmath38 nm is the minimum of the as potential . </S>",
    "<S> for the three - body potential , this implies that triplets of particles in which two or three distances of separations are greater than @xmath39 are ignored in the calculation of the forces . </S>",
    "<S> in order to investigate the influence of @xmath39 for the two - body potential , a value of @xmath40 is taken in specific cases . </S>",
    "<S> the typical duration of the runs is @xmath41 ps from which @xmath42 independent configurations are extracted for the statistical analysis of the physical quantities . </S>",
    "<S> six states of liquid kr from the vicinity of the critical point to that of the triple point have been studied , which are those investigated by guarini _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite and by barocchi _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , respectively at low- and large-@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> these states correspond to temperature @xmath43 k and densities @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 nm@xmath47 , @xmath48 k with @xmath49 and @xmath50 nm@xmath47 , and @xmath51 k  with @xmath52 nm@xmath47 .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 , we present the large @xmath1 behavior of @xmath0 for the three different temperatures and we compare the md curves , calculated with the three different values of @xmath17 ,  to the experimental data of barocchi _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite . as the temperature increases and density decreases , the first sharp diffraction peak as well as the subsequent oscillations become less pronounced . </S>",
    "<S> this is well predicted by the md results since a remarkable agreement with the experiments is found whatever the values of @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen that the three - body contributions have only a minor influence even if a more careful examination shows that , at low temperature , the height of the first peak is better described without the at potential while , at high temperature , a closer agreement is obtained when it is included . at low-@xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> the three potential energy functions give rise to completely different behaviors of @xmath0 and the best results seem to be those obtained with the @xmath10 interaction .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now focus on the low-@xmath1 part of @xmath0 in more details . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the md curves to the recent small - angle scattering data of guarini _ et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite along the @xmath43 k and @xmath48 k isotherms in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively . at the highest temperature , near the critical isotherm , a good agreement is found with the experiment at the three densities with the @xmath10 potential . examining the influence of @xmath17 at density @xmath44 nm@xmath47 </S>",
    "<S> , it appears that the as two - body potential alone ( @xmath53 ) is not able to predict the small-@xmath1 part of @xmath0 satisfactorily , while the effective at contribution ( @xmath54 ) gives rise to a structure factor which is underestimated . </S>",
    "<S> the chain curve corresponds to @xmath0 obtained with the as potential alone and a cutoff radius @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of @xmath39 is seen only below @xmath56 nm@xmath57 and the curvature is slightly changed . as a result , this would have the effect of increasing the values of @xmath0 in this region whatever the potential used . </S>",
    "<S> taking @xmath55 when the three - body contribution is considered is computationally too costly and could represent a challenge for future developments of the present md code . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the three - body potential , it is worth noting that , even with @xmath37 , configurations in which one pair of particles of a triplet is separated up to @xmath58 are taken into account in the calculation of the forces . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the at potential given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqat ] ) decays as @xmath59 therefore taking a cutoff radius larger than @xmath60 seems not to be necessary . </S>",
    "<S> the same observation can be drawn along the @xmath48 k isotherm , as shown in fig 2 ( b ) , and in this case a very good agreement with the experimental curves is seen when the @xmath10 potential is taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> interesting enough , both experimental data sets of guarini _ et al_. @xcite and barocchi _ et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which connect to each other very well around @xmath61 nm@xmath3 , lie between the curves corresponding to @xmath30 and @xmath54 , for @xmath1 values in the range between @xmath56 and @xmath62 nm@xmath63    at @xmath51 k the situation is less clear as it can be seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . while the as potential is also not sufficient to predict the small-@xmath1 behavior of @xmath0 , this time the best concordance with the experiment is obtained by using @xmath54 . nevertheless , the latter effective at contribution would have a tendency to underestimate the @xmath64 data while the @xmath10 strength gives the best prediction . in this case , taking again a cutoff radius of @xmath40 for the two - body potential alone ( chain curve ) has only a negligible influence on @xmath0 , therefore our results for the two- plus three - body might be correct . </S>",
    "<S> it should be stressed that the amplitude of @xmath65 is very small at such a low temperature and high density state , and the relative difference between the md curves with @xmath66 and @xmath67 is of the same order of magnitude than the dispersion of the experimental data points , which is about 10 % . </S>",
    "<S> at this stage , we refrain from drawing any conclusion and it would be desirable to dispose of an accurate small angle scattering experiment for this thermodynamic state .    </S>",
    "<S> we also examine the influence of the three - body potential on the internal energy @xmath68 and the virial pressure @xmath69 gathered in table 1 . </S>",
    "<S> long - range corrections have been applied , due to the truncation of the as and the at potentials during the simulation at @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the corrections to the two - body part of the energy and the pressure are respectively @xmath70 and @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> for the three - body parts , the corrections are estimated numerically using the integral equation method @xcite . for the energy , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath72 for @xmath66 and @xmath73 for @xmath74 , while for the pressure we get @xmath75 for @xmath66 and @xmath76 for @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> these quantities are expressed in the unit of the minimum of the as potential @xmath77 j. the influence of @xmath17 on the energy is moderate and does not exceed @xmath78 % with respect to that of the two - body potential , even with @xmath79 . on the contrary , it has a large effect on the pressure . for the two - body potential alone , </S>",
    "<S> the pressure is always negative , while by including the three - body potential contribution , it becomes positive in the majority of cases . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , @xmath74 yields pressure values which are too high , while the @xmath10 strength gives the best predictions , even if it is always smaller compared to the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> again , the calculated pressures with @xmath66 and @xmath74 enclose the experimental values .    </S>",
    "<S> regarding the results presented above , it appears that the details of the interaction model has no significant influence on @xmath0 at large @xmath1 , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . even the as two - body potential alone is able to reproduce the structure factor with a good degree of accuracy . for the structure factor at small scattering angle and the pressure , </S>",
    "<S> the three - body interactions can not be ignored in the liquid state . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is seen that the triple - dipole contribution gives the best agreement with the experiments and therefore represents the main three - body effect . </S>",
    "<S> a more precise examination shows that the structural and thermodynamic properties depart substantially from the experiments even with the model combining the as two - body potential plus @xmath10 contribution . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , discrepancies remain ( i ) on the small @xmath1 part of @xmath0 in the range between @xmath56 and @xmath62 nm@xmath57 , where the calculated values are higher that the experimental ones , especially for isotherms @xmath48 k and @xmath51 k , and ( ii ) on the pressure where the theoretical results are systematically below the measurements , and even remain negative for two thermodynamic states . since the pressure varies linearly with @xmath17 , as it can be seen in table 1 , better results should be obtained by increasing the value of @xmath74 between @xmath80 and @xmath81 , whatever the temperature .    we are led to the same conclusion as guarini _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite _  _ that the value of @xmath17 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqat ] ) has to be increased with respect to that of the triple - dipole @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> however , by the light of the present md calculations , an effective strength @xmath82 seems to be too important , and we estimate that the additional three - body terms beyond the @xmath10 one should represent up to @xmath83 % of it . </S>",
    "<S> now the question arises to know what is the nature of the missing contributions that will take a non negligible part in the interaction model . according to copeland and kestner @xcite who studied liquid argon , two majors three - body potentials beyond the @xmath10 one play an important role , namely the exchange overlap and the @xmath11 dispersion acting respectively at short and long interatomic distances . </S>",
    "<S> both potentials are known to have significant influence @xcite , however , while the @xmath11 potential has the same sign as the @xmath10 contribution , the exchange one has an opposite sign . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it will be of primary importance to investigate their interplay in liquid krypton and whether they improve the description of the interactions in liquid kr when added to the @xmath31 term </S>",
    "<S> . it has been recently shown by van der hoef and madden @xcite in their simulation study of liquid argon that the @xmath11 contribution on the pressure is small but not negligible and it would be interesting to extend these results in the case of kr , not only for the pressure but also for the structure factor .    at very small wave - number , i.e. @xmath84 nm@xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> the md results of @xmath0 underestimate the experimental curves as well as the @xmath64 data , which is particularly visible along the isotherm @xmath43 k displayed in fig . 2 ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> as md simulations are concerned , we are unavoidably confronted to finite size effects and this fact might be attributed mainly to two factors : the truncation of the pair - correlation functions at the half of the box size , and the use of a cutoff radius of the interactions . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the @xmath0 calculated by fourier transform are subject to large uncertainties and must be taken cautiously . moreover , near the critical region , the correlation length can exceed the size of the simulation box and for this reason the present md simulations might be not able to catch the correct behavior of @xmath65 at @xmath43 k. as a matter of fact , as pointed out by wilding @xcite and rovere @xcite , in the thermodynamic limit , critical phenomena , like the divergence of @xmath85 , are smeared out and shifted .    in conclusion , md simulations have been carried out for kr in the liquid phase for which new small angle scattering experiments were recently performed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this study completes preceding works on the low density and high temperature states of kr @xcite , where it was demonstrated that the aziz and slaman two - body potential associated to the axirod and teller triple - dipole contribution gives a excellent representation of interactions in the gaseous phase . here </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the latter potential energy function predicts the essential characteristics of structural properties in liquid kr , even though we believe that an accurate description of @xmath0 at low @xmath1 and the thermodynamic properties requires that other three - body contributions such as the dipole - dipole - quadrupole and the exchange overlap potentials are taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> large scale md simulations including these additional contributions will be performed in the near future .    </S>",
