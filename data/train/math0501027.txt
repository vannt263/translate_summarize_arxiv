    "in this section , we estimate the best lipshitz constant of a degree 1 map from a riemannian 2-sphere @xmath19 to the unit 2-sphere .",
    "pick any point p in @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath20 be the metric sphere around p of radius r - that is , the set of points x in @xmath1 whose distance from p is r. let d be the the largest diameter of any connected component of the distance sphere @xmath20 for any radius r. we will prove that the smallest lipshitz constant of any degree 1 map from @xmath1 to the unit sphere is approximately @xmath21 .",
    "the smallest lipshitz constant of a degree 1 map from @xmath1 to the unit 2-sphere is at least @xmath22 and at most @xmath23 .    to prove the upper bound",
    ", we will construct a lipshitz degree 1 map .",
    "for some radius r , one component of @xmath20 has diameter d. choose two points q and r in that component , so that the distance from q to r is d. we define @xmath24 .",
    "the function @xmath25 maps @xmath1 to @xmath26 , with lipshitz constant @xmath27 .",
    "we will consider the restriction of @xmath25 to three curves in @xmath28 : a minimal geodesic @xmath29 from p to q , a minimal geodesic @xmath30 from p to r , and a curve @xmath31 joining q to r. for now , we will assume that the component of @xmath32 containing q and r is path connected , and we take @xmath31 to lie in this component .",
    "the image under @xmath25 of the geodesic @xmath29 is the straight line from @xmath33 to @xmath34 . because @xmath31 lies in @xmath32 , the image of @xmath31 under @xmath25",
    "is contained in the line @xmath35 .",
    "the image of the geodesic @xmath30 can not be determined exactly , but we will prove that it lies above a certain line .",
    "let @xmath36 parametrize @xmath30 by arclength with @xmath37 and @xmath38 . by definition , @xmath39 .",
    "then @xmath40 , and the image @xmath41 is the graph of the function @xmath42 .",
    "the function f has lipshitz norm less than or equal to 1 . since the distance from q to r is d , @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , the graph of f lies above the line from @xmath44 to @xmath45 .",
    "let t be the open triangle in @xmath26 with vertices @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "we have proved that @xmath41 does not intersect t , and it is easy to check that @xmath48 and @xmath49 do nt intersect t either .",
    "let c be the embedded circle in @xmath1 formed by joining @xmath29 , @xmath31 , and @xmath30 .",
    "after choosing an appropriate orientation of c , @xmath50 has degree one .",
    "the triangle t contains an embedded disk u of radius @xmath51 . using the exponential map ,",
    "we construct a homeomorphism @xmath52 from the disk u to the northern hemisphere of the unit sphere .",
    "we define a map @xmath53 from the disk u to the southern hemisphere of the unit sphere by composing @xmath52 with a reflection through the plane of the equator .",
    "we extend @xmath52 and @xmath53 to all of @xmath26 as follows . for any point",
    "x outside of u , let p(x ) be the nearest point to x on the boundary of u. now , define @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the maps @xmath52 and @xmath53 agree on the the boundary of u and hence on all the points outside of u. the maps @xmath52 and @xmath53 have lipshitz constant @xmath56 .",
    "finally we define our degree 1 map .",
    "the curve c divides @xmath57 into two disks , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , which we name so that the orientation on c is compatible with that of @xmath58 and incompatible with that of @xmath59 .",
    "we define f on each disk as follows :    @xmath60    f is continuous because @xmath61 lies outside of u , and @xmath62 outside u. f is degree 1 because @xmath63 is degree 1 .",
    "f has lipshitz constant @xmath64 .    if the connected component of @xmath32 containing q and r is not path connected , it is still true that its @xmath65-neighborhood is path connected for every @xmath66 , and we can take @xmath31 to be a path lying as close as we like to @xmath32 .",
    "this curve @xmath31 suffices for our construction , producing a map with lipshitz constant @xmath67 for an arbitrary positive @xmath68 . since the space of maps with a fixed lipshitz constant between compact spaces is compact",
    ", there is a limit of these maps which is lipshitz with constant @xmath69 .    to prove the lower bound",
    ", we recall a theorem of gromov about the uryson width . in section",
    "f of @xcite , gromov proves that if a riemannian manifold @xmath70 has uryson 1-width less than @xmath71 , then any contracting map from @xmath70 to the unit 2-sphere is null - homotopic .",
    "( in section 5 , we discuss this result of gromov in detail . ) the quotient map from @xmath1 to the space of connected components of the distance spheres around p has fibers of diameter no more than d. if this space of connected components were a 1-polyhedron , then the uryson 1-width of @xmath19 would be no more than d. applying gromov s theorem , we would see that the lipshitz constant of a degree 1 map from @xmath1 to the unit 2-sphere is at least @xmath22 .",
    "we deal with the general case by perturbing @xmath72 to a morse function .",
    "the space of connected components of the fibers of a morse function is an honest 1-polyhedron .",
    "it is an exercise in point - set topology to check that for each @xmath68 there is a @xmath65 so that any function g obeying @xmath73 has fibers whose connected components have diameter less than @xmath74 .",
    "we take a morse function g obeying this inequality , which proves that the uryson 1-width of @xmath75 for every @xmath68 .    as a corollary",
    ", we are able to estimate the degree 1 hypersphericity , the hypersphericity , and the uryson 1-width of @xmath1 in terms of the number d.    @xmath76    in this formula , @xmath77 stands for the degree 1 hypersphericity , @xmath78 stands for the hypersphericity , and @xmath79 stands for the uryson 1-width .",
    "in particular , we see that the degree 1 hypersphericity , the hypersphericity , and the uryson 1-width of a 2-sphere all agree up to a bounded factor . by contrast , we will prove in section 5 that for surfaces of high genus , any two of these invariants can disagree by an arbitrarily large factor .",
    "in this section we will bound the length of the shortest closed geodesic on @xmath1 by a multiple of the degree 1 hypersphericity .",
    "the existence of a short closed geodesic follows from fairly standard methods once we have a sufficiently nice family of short curves on @xmath1 .",
    "we begin by proving the existence of such a family .",
    "suppose @xmath1 has degree 1 hypersphericity less than 1 .",
    "then there is a map f from @xmath1 to a trivalent tree t , so that each fiber of the map has length less than 120 .",
    "the fibers of the map have controlled topology : the preimage of any point in an edge of t is a circle , the preimage of a terminal vertex of t is a point , and the preimage of a trivalent vertex of t is homeomorphic to the greek letter @xmath80 .",
    "here is an outline of the proof .",
    "the first step is to find a collection of short disjoint circles in @xmath1 , cutting it into components of bounded diameter .",
    "we begin by taking the connected components of distance spheres around some point p in @xmath19 .",
    "these disjoint circles have bounded diameter , but they may be very long .",
    "we replace each distance sphere by a homologous curve which is a union of short circles .",
    "these curves are short , but they may not be disjoint . by applying an appropriate minimization procedure to this set of circles ,",
    "we make them disjoint .",
    "these short disjoint circles will be fibers of the map that we are going to construct .",
    "the second step of the proof is to fill in the map on each region between the short disjoint circles .",
    "since these regions have small diameter , all the geodesic segments in them are short .",
    "we construct a map on each region whose fibers consist of two or three geodesic segments plus some curves of negligible length . as a result ,",
    "all of the fibers have bounded length .",
    "pick a point p in @xmath1 , and consider the distance spheres around p. ( we first smooth the distance function so that almost every distance sphere is a union of circles . ) let @xmath7 be the distance sphere around p of radius @xmath81 , and let @xmath82 be the distance sphere around p of radius @xmath83 .",
    "of course @xmath82 separates @xmath7 from @xmath84 .",
    "equivalently , each curve from @xmath7 to @xmath84 has non - zero ( topological ) intersection number with one of the components of @xmath82 . by theorem 1.1 ,",
    "each component @xmath85 of @xmath82 has diameter less than 12 .",
    "we now use a standard trick to replace each @xmath85 with a union of shorter curves , which still separate @xmath7 from @xmath84 . for each component @xmath85 , take a sequence of points @xmath86 going around it , with consecutive points very close together . let @xmath87 be a minimal geodesic from @xmath86 to @xmath88 .",
    "note that each @xmath87 is disjoint from @xmath7 and from @xmath84 .",
    "let @xmath89 be the closed curve formed by composing @xmath87 , @xmath90 , and the portion of @xmath85 from @xmath86 to @xmath91 .",
    "now each @xmath89 has length less than 24 , each @xmath89 is disjoint from @xmath7 and @xmath84 , and each curve joining @xmath7 to @xmath84 has non - zero topological intersection number with one of the @xmath89 .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath92 may be far from disjoint .",
    "one of the main steps of this proof is to modify them to make them disjoint",
    ".    we will modify the @xmath89 using a minimization procedure .",
    "first , we define a minimal basis .",
    "let @xmath93 be a compact surface with a riemannian metric and convex boundary , and suppose @xmath94 has dimension n. we consider all sets of n circles which form a rational basis for the first homology group of u. we define a partial ordering on these bases as follows .",
    "let s be a set of n oriented curves in u , which form a rational basis for @xmath95 , and let the lengths of the curves be @xmath96 . for two bases s and t",
    ", we say that t is smaller than s if @xmath97 for every i and @xmath98 for some i. we call s a minimal basis if there is no smaller basis .",
    "because u is compact , there is a minimal basis .",
    "each curve in a minimal basis minimizes length in its homology class . because the boundary of u is convex",
    ", each curve in a minimal basis is a closed geodesic .",
    "also , no curve is a multiple covering of a closed geodesic , because we could replace it with a single covering of that geodesic , making the basis smaller .",
    "these geodesics must be distinct , else they would not form a basis , and so they intersect transversally .",
    "following gromov , we define a curve @xmath99 to be straight if for any two points x and y on @xmath99 , the distance in u from x to y is equal to the distance in @xmath99 from x to y. in section 5 of @xcite , gromov showed that a minimal rational basis for the first homology group consists of straight circles .",
    "we will prove a slightly stronger statement .",
    "we define a curve @xmath99 to be strictly straight if , for any two points x and y on @xmath99 and any minimal segment p from x to y , p lies in @xmath99 .",
    "a strictly straight circle is always an embedded closed geodesic .",
    "if @xmath93 is a compact surface with convex boundary and s is a minimal rational basis for the first homology of u , then every curve in s is strictly straight .",
    "any two curves in s intersect at most once . if u is planar , the curves in s are disjoint .",
    "suppose that one curve @xmath99 in s is not strictly straight . then there are points x and y in @xmath99 and a minimal segment p from x to y which does not lie in @xmath99",
    ". since p and @xmath99 are both geodesics , p must be transverse to @xmath99 at x and y. now , we define @xmath100 and @xmath101 to be the closed curves formed by connecting p to either path in @xmath99 from x to y. since p is minimal , each of @xmath100 and @xmath101 is no longer than @xmath99",
    ". moreover , @xmath100 and @xmath101 have corners at x and y , so they can be homotoped to curves which are strictly shorter than @xmath99 .",
    "now either @xmath100 or @xmath101 is linearly independent from the other curves in the basis s. replacing @xmath99 in s by one of these curves gives a strictly smaller rational basis .",
    "therefore , every curve in a minimal basis is strictly straight .",
    "suppose that two geodesics @xmath100 and @xmath101 in s intersect in two points x and y. let p be any minimal segment from x to y. since @xmath100 and @xmath101 are strictly straight , p lies in both @xmath100 and @xmath101 , and so @xmath100 and @xmath101 coincide . since @xmath100 and @xmath101 are distinct , they do not intersect in two points",
    ".    now suppose that u is a planar domain .",
    "suppose that two of the curves in s intersect in only one point . since they are distinct closed geodesics , they intersect transversally , and their intersection number must be 1 or -1 .",
    "but since u is a planar domain , the intersection number of any two closed curves in u is zero .",
    "therefore , the curves in s are disjoint .    with this lemma",
    ", we can modify the curves @xmath92 to make them disjoint .",
    "let @xmath102 be the portion of @xmath1 between @xmath7 and @xmath84 . by making an arbitrarily small bilipshitz change of the metric",
    ", we can assume that each @xmath102 has convex boundary . to see this , for instance",
    ", we can use the normal exponential map to give a metric with a geodesic boundary and then slightly increase the metric along the boundary .",
    "it is not difficult .",
    "then , in each @xmath102 , we consider a minimal rational basis of the first homology .",
    "notice that each @xmath102 is a planar domain .",
    "by lemma 2.2 , a minimal basis is realized by disjoint curves .",
    "we keep only the curves in the basis with length less than 24 , and label these @xmath103 .",
    "since each @xmath92 has length less than 24 , the homology class of each @xmath92 lies in the rational span of the @xmath103 .",
    "now any path from @xmath7 to @xmath84 has non - zero intersection number with some @xmath92 , and so it must have non - zero intersection number with some @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath103 separate @xmath7 from @xmath84 .",
    "cut @xmath1 along the curves @xmath103 .",
    "we claim that each component of the complement has radius less than 36 .",
    "let x be a component of the complement , not containing p , and b the boundary component of x closest to p. any point in x is within 24 from b , using the distance function of @xmath1 .",
    "this estimate remains true for the intrinsic distance in x. to see this , pick any point x in x , and consider a minimal geodesic g from x to p. we break g into pieces @xmath104 .",
    "each curve @xmath105 is a single minimal geodesic in @xmath102 .",
    "then we replace each @xmath105 with the minimal geodesic @xmath106 in the slightly modified metric on @xmath102 between the endpoints of @xmath105 .",
    "we define @xmath107 to be the union of all @xmath106 .",
    "the curve @xmath107 still goes from x to p , and it has practically the same length as g. since each @xmath103 is strictly straight in the modified metric on @xmath102 , @xmath106 crosses @xmath103 no more than once . therefore , @xmath107 crosses each @xmath103 no more than once .",
    "in particular , @xmath107 stays in x until it hits b , and we see that the intrinsic distance from x to b is less than 24 . now pick any point b in b. the distance from any point in x to b is less than 36 . on the other hand ,",
    "if x contains p , and x is any point in x , then the curve @xmath107 from x to p stays in x and has length less than 24 .",
    "let us summarize what we have done so far .",
    "we have found a set of disjoint embedded closed curves @xmath108 on @xmath1 , each of length less than 24 , so that each component of their complement has radius less than 36 .",
    "the curves @xmath108 which we have just constructed will be fibers of the map we are going to build .",
    "it remains for us to define the map on each component of their complement .",
    "we call the components @xmath109 . for each @xmath109",
    ", we will construct a map @xmath110 from @xmath109 to a tree @xmath111 , with the property that each boundary component of @xmath109 is the fiber of a terminal vertex of @xmath111 .",
    "putting together all of these maps , we get a single map from @xmath1 to a tree t whose fibers are just the fibers of the maps @xmath110 .",
    "therefore , our theorem reduces to the following lemma .",
    "let u be a planar domain , compact with boundary .",
    "suppose each boundary component of u has length less than 24 , and that the radius of u is less than 36 .",
    "then u admits a map to a trivalent tree t , so that each fiber has length less than 120 .",
    "each boundary component of u is the fiber of a terminal vertex of t. the fibers of the map have controlled topology : the preimage of a point on an edge is a circle , the preimage of a terminal vertex is either a point or a boundary component , and the preimage of a trivalent vertex is homeomorphic to the letter @xmath80 .",
    "we pick a point p so that every point in u lies in the ball around p of radius 36 . after a small bilipshitz change of the metric",
    ", we can assume that the boundary is convex .",
    "therefore , every minimal path from an interior point to p avoids the boundary and is a geodesic .",
    "the proof will focus on the set of all minimal geodesics in u with one endpoint at p. away from the point p and from the cut locus of the exponential map , this set of minimal geodesics forms a foliation , and we will view the set of minimal geodesics on the whole space as a foliation with some singular leaves .",
    "the plan of the proof is to modify this foliation until it consists of disjoint closed leaves ( with mild singularities ) which will be the fibers of the desired map .",
    "for an arbitrary metric , the foliation by minimal geodesics may have very complicated singularities .",
    "morally , we should be able to reduce the singularities to standard types by making a @xmath112-small perturbation of the metric .",
    "for technical reasons , it is more convenient to perturb the geodesics in a different way",
    ". let s be the circle around p of radius @xmath68 , where @xmath68 is much less than the injectivity radius of the exponential map at p. the normal exponential map is a mapping from the normal bundle of s to u , and the images of the fibers of the normal bundle are exactly the geodesics through p. instead of perturbing the metric of u , we let @xmath113 be a @xmath112-small perturbation of the circle s and use the normal exponential map of @xmath113 in place of the normal exponential map of s.    we now define our perturbed foliation precisely . we parametrize @xmath113 by the coordinate @xmath80 . for @xmath114 , we define the normal exponential map @xmath115 to be the endpoint of the geodesic segment of length @xmath116 leaving @xmath113 at @xmath80 in the outward normal direction .",
    "our perturbed geodesics are given by @xmath115 for fixed @xmath80 and varying @xmath116 .",
    "the minimal geodesics of our perturbed family extend only until the infimal value of @xmath116 at which @xmath117 with @xmath118 .",
    "this defines a foliation with singular leaves on the exterior of @xmath113 .",
    "for each value of r , the function @xmath115 defines a legendrian curve in u , and so we can view f as a 1-parameter family of legendrian curves .",
    "the singularities of the foliation by geodesics normal to @xmath113 correspond exactly to the singularities of this family of legendrian curves . because @xmath113 was generic ,",
    "this family contains only standard types of singularities , as described in @xcite .",
    "a generic legendrian curve has only two kinds of singularities : self - intersections and cusps .",
    "a generic 1-parameter family of legendrian curves has several more kinds of singularities , which occur at discrete values of the parameter .",
    "these singularities are self - tangencies , triple - intersections , cusp formations and cancellations , and cusp crossings .",
    "the possible singularities of the foliation are reduced further by some metric considerations .",
    "the legendrian curve @xmath119 includes the set of all points at distance r from @xmath113 , and it may also include some points which are closer to @xmath120 .",
    "we call the set of points at distance r from @xmath113 the metric front of the legendrian curve . because we are taking the foliation by minimal geodesics , only the singularities on the metric front of the legendrian curve correspond to singularities of the foliation .",
    "cusps , cusp cancellations , and cusp crossings can not occur on the metric front of the legendrian curves @xmath115 . therefore , the foliation by minimal geodesics normal to @xmath113 only has singularities corresponding to self - intersections , self - tangencies , cusp formations , and triple - intersections .",
    "a self - intersection of the legendrian curve corresponds to a double point of our foliation where two equal rays meet and terminate .",
    "because self - intersections occur generically on legendrian curves , the double points form a 1-dimensional manifold .",
    "all other singularities occur at isolated points .",
    "a self - tangency of the legendrian curve corresponds to a special double point , where two equal rays meet head - on ( making an angle of @xmath121 ) .",
    "we will not need to distinguish these self - tangency points from ordinary double points .",
    "a cusp formation of the legendrian curve corresponds to a singular point of the foliation where a single ray ends at a point .",
    "a triple - intersection of the legendrian curve corresponds to a triple point of the foliation where three equal rays meet and terminate .    for now",
    ", we extend the foliation to the interior of the curve @xmath113 by taking minimal geodesics to p. the resulting foliation on the interior of @xmath113 is non - singular except at p , where it has a serious singularity which we will have to deal with later . by putting the boundary in general position , we can assume that the only singular points which occur on the boundary are double points .",
    "there are a finite number of boundary double points .",
    "since the boundary is convex , the foliation is transverse to the boundary away from the boundary double points .    to summarize",
    ", we have constructed a foliation of u by perturbed geodesics .",
    "because the perturbation was very slight , we may assume that each perturbed geodesic has length less than 36 .",
    "the foliation has five kinds of singular points : the point p , double points , cusp formation points , triple points , and boundary double points .",
    "we include a diagram illustrating the five types of singular points .",
    "we will do three surgeries to the foliation .",
    "the first surgery fixes the foliation so that each boundary component of u is a leaf of the foliation .",
    "it takes place in a small neighborhood of the boundary of u. the second surgery fixes the foliation so that it extends over p. it takes place in a small neighborhood of p. the second surgery uses the fact that u is a planar domain .",
    "the third surgery , which is only cosmetic , replaces each singular leaf ending in a cusp formation point by a singular leaf consisting of a single point .",
    "we describe the first surgery .",
    "let c be a boundary component of u. the goal of the first surgery is to modify the foliation near c so that c becomes a leaf .",
    "modify the foliation in a neighborhood of each boundary double point so that it is non - singular and transverse to c. ( this creates a new triple point of the foliation in the interior of u near the old boundary double point . )        step 2 .",
    "parametrize a small neighborhood n of c by @xmath122 $ ] , so that each curve @xmath123 $ ] is a leaf of the foliation and each circle @xmath124 has length less than 24 .",
    "( the circle with r - coordinate @xmath125 is the boundary c. ) let all the circles with r - coordinate less than 0 be leaves of the modified foliation . in particular , c is a leaf of the modified foliation .",
    "next , make a singular leaf of the modified foliation by joining the circle with r - coordinate 0 to two rays from that circle to p. the two rays should be chosen so that they bisect the circle .",
    "this singular leaf cuts the remainder of n into two components , which are each parametrized by @xmath126 $ ] . on each component",
    "we will replace the radial foliation whose leaves are @xmath127 by a rectangular foliation .    for each number @xmath128 strictly between 0 and 1/2 , we make a leaf of the rectangular foliation consisting of two radial line segments and one circular arc .",
    "the radial line segments have @xmath80-coordinate equal to @xmath129 and @xmath130 and r - coordinate greater than or equal to @xmath131 .",
    "the circular arc has r - coordinate equal to @xmath131 and @xmath80-coordinate ranging from @xmath129 to @xmath130 .",
    "finally , there is an exceptional leaf consisting of a radial line with @xmath80-coordinate @xmath71 and r - coordinate greater than or equal to @xmath132 .",
    "the foliation has a singularity at @xmath133 , where it is homeomorphic to a cusp formation point .",
    "this finishes the first surgery .        at the end of the first surgery , all but finitely many leaves of the foliation are curves that start and end at p and have length less than 84 .",
    "there are three kinds of singular leaves .",
    "first , there are leaves with one triple point , which we will call triple leaves .",
    "the first surgery turned each boundary double point into a triple point .",
    "each new triple point lies on a leaf consisting of three rays and an arc parallel to the boundary component c. since this arc has length less than 12 , the length of each new triple leaf is less than 120 .",
    "in addition , the original triple points are still present .",
    "each original triple point lies on a leaf consisting of three rays , with total length less than 108 .",
    "second , there are leaves with two rays joining a circle which is close to a boundary circle , which we will call boundary leaves .",
    "since each boundary circle has length less than 24 , each boundary leaf has length less than 96 . finally , there are rays ending at cusp formation points , which we will call cusp leaves .",
    "every leaf has length less than 120 .",
    "we describe the second surgery .",
    "the goal of the second surgery is to modify the foliation near p so that it extends over p.    step 1 .",
    "draw a small circle c around p , and foliate the disk bounded by c by small concentric circles , with a point at p. pick two points on c whose rays meet at a double point , and add the rays to the circle to make a singular leaf l.        because u is a planar domain , the leaf l divides the remainder of u into two components , which we will repair one at a time .",

    "at the end of the surgery , the foliation is no longer singular at the point p. since the circles and arcs in the surgery can be taken arbitrarily small , the surgery has a negligible effect on the lengths of leaves .",

    ", we can replace the singular fibers by fibers homeomorphic to the wedge of two circles .",
    "after this modification , we have a map from @xmath1 to the same tree , the preimage of each trivalent vertex is a wedge of two circles , the preimage of each point on an edge of the tree is a circle , and the preimage of each terminal vertex is a point .",
    "each fiber has length less than 157 .",

    "we will prove that f can be continuously deformed within the space of lipshitz maps until it reaches a local minimum of the length functional , and so that every map on the way has length less than 160 .",
    "we can choose a constant @xmath68 sufficiently small that if @xmath5 and @xmath140 are two maps from the wedge of two circles to @xmath1 , and if the @xmath141 distance between them is less than @xmath68 , then there is a homotopy of maps @xmath142 between them so that the length of each @xmath142 is less than 160 . consider all the 1-parameter families of maps starting with f and with length less than 160 .",

    "thus we can deform f to @xmath146 without increasing its length over 160 , and the length of @xmath146 must be equal to l. if any function g was within @xmath68 of @xmath146 in the @xmath141 metric and had length less than l , we could deform @xmath146 to g without increasing its length over 160 , contradicting the definition of l. therefore , @xmath146 minimizes length in a @xmath141 neighborhood .",
    "we now describe the possible maps of a wedge of two circles into a surface which are local minima for the length function .",
    "we let p be the image under a map f of the base point of the wedge of two circles .",
    "clearly , each circle in the wedge is mapped to a geodesic starting and ending at p , which might or might not be the constant map . if exactly one of these circles is constant , then the other one must be a closed geodesic .",
    "if neither circle is constant , then there are four geodesic segments leaving p , and the length - minimizing condition implies that the sum of the four corresponding unit vectors is zero . because the tangent space at p is 2-dimensional , this condition guarantees that the 4 vectors consist of two pairs of opposite vectors .",
    "therefore , the image of the wedge of two circles consists of either 1 or 2 closed geodesics . to summarize , either there is a closed geodesic of length less than 160 , or each singular fiber can be contracted to a point through a family of wedges of two circles with length less than 160 .    from now on",

    "therefore , we have proven that if every ball of radius 24 in a planar domain has hypersphericity less than 1 , then the whole surface has uryson width less than 24 .",
    "since @xmath296 is a planar domain , and every ball of radius 80 in @xmath296 has hypersphericity less than 1 , claim 3 follows .",
    "recall from section 2 that a curve in a riemannian manifold is called strictly straight if any minimal segment joining two points on the curve is contained in the curve .",

    "second , we deal with the main case that the genus of @xmath242 is at least 2 .",
    "we let c be a curve of length less than 24 with non - zero intersecton number with @xmath99 . on a compact manifold ,",
    "we know that there is a curve homologous to c which consists of a union of shorter strictly straight circles .",
    "this is not always true on a non - compact manifold , but we will prove that it is true on @xmath296 .",
    "we first homotope the circle c to a minimal geodesic in its free homotopy class . because the genus of @xmath242 is at least 2 , the circle c can not be moved more than a bounded distance without stretching , and so there is an actual minimizer .",
    "if this minimizer is not strictly straight , we surger it along a minimal segment into two circles .",
    "then we repeat the procedure , homotoping each circle to a minimal geodesic in its free homotopy class , and so on . because of bounded geometry , each time we do a surgery , splitting a closed geodesic of length less than 24 into two pieces , neither piece null - homotopic , and then homotoping the pieces to minimal geodesics , the length of each new piece is less than @xmath300 times the length of the old circle . because the injectivity radius of @xmath296 is bounded below",
    ", this procedure must terminate after a finite number of surgeries , with a union of strictly straight circles each of length less than 24 .",
    "since the union is homologous to c , one of the curves intersects @xmath99 .",
    "q has no torsion .",
    "suppose q had a torsion element q of order n. pick a point @xmath293 in @xmath296 and let @xmath99 be a minimal geodesic from @xmath293 to @xmath301 .",

    "now , it is a topological fact that two numbers in @xmath314 differing by an integer are mapped to the same point of t by @xmath313 .",
    "call the two numbers a and b , and let p and q be the points parametrized by a and b. it may not be the case that p and q are mapped to the same point by @xmath121 , because we have modified @xmath121 along some disjoint intervals .",
    "let @xmath315 and @xmath316 be the closest endpoints of the intervals containing a and b , and let @xmath214 and @xmath317 be the points in c parametrized by @xmath315 and @xmath316 .",
    "the distance from p to @xmath214 is less than 12 , as is the distance from q to @xmath317 .",
    "also , @xmath214 and @xmath317 are mapped to the same point of t by the original @xmath121 , so the distance between them is no more than 24 .",
    "therefore , the distance between p and q is no more than 48 . on the other hand ,",
    "the distance between any two different points in the same q - orbit is at least 80 .",
    "this contradiction establishes the claim .",
    "any two points in the same q orbit are in different components of @xmath318 .",
    "let @xmath99 be any curve connecting @xmath293 to @xmath319 , avoiding all the circles in s. since there is no torsion in q , the union of all the curves @xmath320 , for all integers n , is a single curve running from one end of @xmath297 to another . by claim 4 , this curve must intersect a circle in s. but since s is invariant under the action of q ( or under any isometry ) , @xmath99 must intersect a circle in s.    because s is q - invariant , the curves in s descend to disjoint curves in @xmath242 of length less than 24 , dividing @xmath242 into planar domains .",
    "this establishes the last statement of the lemma .",

    ", we will prove inequalities about the hypersphericity and uryson 1-width of the surfaces @xmath260 .",

    "we now recall gromov s extension theorem for maps of small width , which appeared in @xcite .",
    "[ gromov ] if p is a surjective map from x to y with width less than @xmath71 , and if f is a contracting map from x to a unit sphere ( of any dimension ) , then f is homotopic to a map that factors through p.      as a special case of the corollary , we see that the hypersphericity of a riemannian n - manifold is bounded by @xmath338 times its uryson ( n-1)-width , which is an inequality we used several times in this paper .    using gromov s extension theorem",
    ", we can construct surfaces with arbitrarily small degree 1 hypersphericity but with hypersphericity at least 1 .",
    "for example , let @xmath11 be a degree 2 branched covering of the unit 2-sphere , branched over an @xmath68-dense set of points , with the induced metric ( strictly speaking the induced metric is singular , but we can add a tiny positive symmetric form to make a riemannian metric ) .",
    "the branched covering map has width less than @xmath339 , and it s certainly surjective . by gromov s theorem , any contracting map from @xmath242 to the sphere of radius @xmath339 factors through the branched covering and has even degree .",
    "therefore , the degree 1 hypersphericity of @xmath242 is less than @xmath340 . on the other hand ,",
    "the branched covering is itself a contracting degree 2 map to the unit sphere , and so the hypersphericity of @xmath242 is at least 1 .",
    "we will define a class of maps called maps of small girth which generalize the surjective maps of small width , and extend gromov s theorem to the maps of small girth .",
    "this generalization is not very serious , but it will be convenient for our purposes , and we will include more details of the proof than appear in @xcite .",
    "to arrive at the definition of the girth of a map , we make a slight shift in point of view . instead of a polyhedron y ,",
    "the target of our map is a polyhedron y equipped with a cover by open sets , @xmath341 . instead of taking a surjective map from x to y ,",
    "we take a map p whose image intersects each open set @xmath102 in the cover . for any point y in y ,",
    "let @xmath342 be the union of all @xmath102 containing y. instead of considering the fiber @xmath343 , we consider the fattened fiber @xmath344 .",
    "we say that the map p has girth less than w if @xmath344 has radius less than w.    we will say that a riemannian manifold m has convexity radius at least w if each ball of radius at most w is convex with respect to minimal geodesics .",
    "a set u in m is convex with respect to minimal geodesics if for any two points x and y in u , there is a unique minimal geodesic in m joining x to y , and this minimal geodesic lies in u. for instance , any complete riemannian manifold with sectional curvature less than 1 and injectivity radius at least @xmath121 has convexity radius at least @xmath71 .",
    "if p is a map from x to y with girth less than w , f is a contracting map from x to m , and m is a riemannian manifold with convexity radius at least w , then there is a map g from y to m so that f is homotopic to @xmath345 .",
    "moreover , the homotopy moves each point of x by no more than 2w .",
    "first we replace the @xmath102 by a locally finite sub - cover , and we redefine @xmath342 accordingly . since the new @xmath342 is contained in the old @xmath342 , the fattened fibers @xmath344 still have radius strictly less than w. we pick a number @xmath68 so that the girth of p is less than @xmath346 .",
    "we define a map g from y to the set of convex sets in m. for each point y in y , @xmath347 is defined to be the convex hull of the @xmath68-neighborhood of @xmath348 . by the definition of girth",

    "the main point of the proof is to construct a `` section '' of the map g : that is , a continuous map g from y to m so that @xmath352 lies in @xmath347 for each y. this step is a bit technical .",
    "i think the moral reason why we can find a section is just that each set g(y ) is contractible , but there are technicalities because the sets @xmath347 may not vary continuously with y.    we divide y into simplices so small that each simplex lies in one of the @xmath102 . then we construct the map g one skeleton at a time , so that at each stage it is continuous and g(y ) lies in g(y ) .",
    "the map from the zero skeleton is trivial to construct . by induction",
    ", it suffices to extend our section from the boundary of a simplex to its interior .",
    "we pick a simplex @xmath353 and assume that g is defined on its boundary so that @xmath352 lies in @xmath347 for each y on the boundary .",
    "we choose a homeomorphism of @xmath353 with the ball of radius 1 .",
    "since the simplex lies in one of the @xmath102 , there is a point m in m which lies in @xmath347 for every y in @xmath353 .",
    "we define g(y ) to be m for each y in a ball of radius @xmath354 , for some small number @xmath65 which we will choose later . then , we extend g to the annulus @xmath355 by mapping each ray @xmath356 to the minimal geodesic between @xmath357 and m. our extension g is clearly continuous , and it only remains to check that g(y ) lies in g(y ) for every y.    the boundary of @xmath353 is compact , so it meets only finitely many of the @xmath102 .",
    "we number these @xmath358 .",
    "for any subset i of the numbers from 1 to n , we define @xmath359 to be the set of points in the boundary of the simplex which lie in @xmath102 exactly when i is a member of i. we define @xmath360 to be the convex hull of the epsilon - neighborhood of @xmath361 .",
    "the condition that @xmath352 lies in @xmath347 means exactly that g maps @xmath359 into @xmath360 for each i. now the sets @xmath359 are not closed , but each point in the closure of @xmath359 lies in a @xmath362 where j is a subset of i , and so we see that g maps the closure of @xmath359 into @xmath360 for each i. since the sets @xmath360 are open , g maps a small neighborhood of the closure of each @xmath359 into @xmath360 . therefore , we may choose closed sets @xmath363 , so that when we define @xmath364 as the set of points y which lie in @xmath365 exactly when i is a member of i , g(y ) lies in @xmath360 for each y in @xmath364 .",
    "this tiny improvement gives us the space we need to prove that g(y ) lies in g(y ) .",

    "this homotopy moves each point of x less than 2w .",
    "we prove that the uryson 1-width of each surface @xmath260 is at least the convexity radius of m. to see this , suppose that @xmath260 admitted a map p to a 1-polyhedron y whose fibers had diameter less than the convexity radius of m. after changing the target , we can assume that p is surjective . therefore , the girth of p is less than the convexity radius of m. the inclusion of @xmath260 in m is a contracting map ( because @xmath260 has the induced metric from m ) .",
    "therefore , the extension lemma applies , proving that the inclusion of @xmath260 in m factors through p up to homotopy .",
    "but the map p kills the fundamental homology class of @xmath260 , and the inclusion of @xmath260 does not .",
    "therefore , the uryson 1-width of @xmath260 is at least the convexity radius of m.    next we bound the hypersphericity of @xmath260 for large values of i. because the surfaces @xmath260 are converging to m in the gromov - hausdorff metric , for large values of i , the inclusion of @xmath260 in m has girth @xmath376 tending to 0 .",
    "now , by the extension lemma , any contracting map from @xmath260 to the sphere of radius @xmath376 factors up to homotopy through the inclusion of @xmath260 in m. if every map from m to the 2-sphere kills the homology class h , then the hypersphericity of @xmath260 is less than @xmath376 .",
    "for example , if m is the complex projective plane and h is any non - zero homology class in @xmath336 , then every map from m to the 2-sphere kills h.      the constructions that we have made for surfaces of high genus also apply to manifolds of higher dimension .",
    "the gromov - hausdorff convergance is provided by a theorem of ferry and okun from @xcite .",
    "we state a weak version of their theorem , which suffices for our purposes .",
    "[ ferry and okun ] let a be a connected manifold of dimension at least 3 and b be a connected riemannian manifold , and let f be a map from a to b which is surjective on @xmath52 .",
    "then there is a sequence of metrics @xmath105 on a and of maps @xmath143 from a to b homotopic to f , so that @xmath377 converges in the gromov - hausdorff metric to b by the maps @xmath143 .",
    "the construction is roughly as follows .",
    "first , homotope f so that the image contains a very dense set of points in b. then , homotope f along various curves joining the preimages of this dense set , so that each nearby pair of points in the dense set is joined by a minimal geodesic lying in the image of f. this last step requires us to find curves in the domain which map to the right homotopy class in the range , which requires surjectivity on @xmath52 .",
    "in particular , this theorem implies that the maps @xmath143 have girth tending to 0 and lipshitz constant tending to 1 . using this theorem",
    ", we can construct metrics on the 4-sphere with arbitrarily small hypersphericity and uryson 3-width at least 1 . to see this ,",
    "take a to be the 4-sphere , b to the quaternionic projective plane , and f to be the hyperplane embedding . applying the theorem of ferry and okun ,",
    "we get metrics @xmath105 on a and maps @xmath143 with girth tending to 0 . applying the estimates just as for surfaces",
    ", we conclude that the uryson 3-width of @xmath378 is at least the convexity radius of the quaternionic projective plane and that its hypersphericity tends to 0 .",
    "we will give two other sequences of surfaces with hypersphericity tending to 0 and uryson 1-width at least 1 .",
    "these examples are included to show that estimating the hypersphericity of a surface is rather complicated .",
    "in each example , a different piece of geometry or topology is used to rule out a non - zero degree contracting map to a small sphere . in our first example , the obstruction came from homotopy theory . in the second example , it will come from lattice theory . in the third example , it will come from some considerations related to the theory of systoles .",
    "these examples require more work to construct then our first example , but they also have slightly stronger properties . for instance , we will construct surfaces @xmath260 so that the smallest lipshitz constant of a homotopically non - trivial map to @xmath379 tends to infinity while the uryson 1-width remains bounded below .",

    "since p is expanding on the scale w , the preimage of @xmath342 is contained in the 4w ball around x. because the girth of p is bounded by 4w , which is less than 1/50 , and the convexity radius of m is at least @xmath71 , we can apply lemma 5.2 , which constructs a map g from y to m obeying the estimate @xmath389 .",
    "we will prove that the map g which we constructed in lemma 5.2 obeys a quasi - lipshitz inequality , bounding the distance between @xmath390 and @xmath391 by @xmath392 .",
    "since p is dense on the scale w , there are points @xmath393 and @xmath394 within w of @xmath395 and @xmath396 , respectively .",
    "recall from the proof of lemma 5.2 that the set g(y ) is the convex hull of a small neighborhood of @xmath397 , and that g(y ) lies in g(y ) .",
    "since @xmath393 lies in @xmath398 , the point @xmath399 lies in @xmath400 .",

    "putting all these estimates together , we get the quasi - lipshitz inequality .    we now explain how to build a lipshitz map h on the scaffold of the quasi - lipshitz map g. this construction is adapted from the paper @xcite of lang , pavlovic , and schroeder , in which they construct lipshitz extensions of lipshitz maps into negatively curved spaces .",
    "for each y in y , we define a set @xmath405 in m as the intersection of the closed balls @xmath406 for every y in y. because of our quasi - lipshitz inequality , the ball of radius w around g(y ) lies in h(y ) , and so h(y ) is not empty . on the other hand , h(y )",

    "this phenomenon can occur on manifolds with bounded geometry as well .",
    "we will construct a metric @xmath489 on @xmath486 with bounded geometry on the scale 1 , and with the property that the homology class @xmath490 $ ] has length only @xmath249 .",
    "we let t be a small tubular neighborhood of an embedded curve homologous to @xmath491 $ ] .",
    "we put a riemannian metric on @xmath486 which , restricted to t , is just the product metric of the disk of radius 1 with the circle of radius 1 .",
    "then we rescale this metric by a large factor r , so that it has bounded geometry on the scale 1 .",
    "next , we will change the metric on the interior of t so that the homology class @xmath490 $ ] is realized by a curve of length @xmath492 .",
    "we choose coordinates on t so that the disk of radius r has standard polar coordinates @xmath116 and @xmath80 , and the circle of radius r has a coordinate z varying from 0 to @xmath493 .",
    "our rescaled metric on t is given in these coordinates as @xmath494 .",
    "we will replace this metric by a metric @xmath495 , where @xmath496 for @xmath497 , and where @xmath498 for @xmath499 . by a routine computation",
    ", it follows that the curvature of this metric is bounded by 1 as long as the first and second derivatives of log f are bounded by 1/2 . for large values of r",
    ", we can easily find a ( non - strictly ) monotonic function f , satisfying the equations above and with the first and second derivatives of log f as small as we like . finally , since f is monotonic , any curve in t contracts to a curve which runs along the core circle defined by the equation r=0 .",
    "since this core circle has length @xmath249 , we see that every closed geodesic in @xmath500 has length at least @xmath249 .",
    "given that the curvature of @xmath501 is bounded by 1 , the bound on the lengths of geodesics proves that the part of @xmath500 a distance at least @xmath121 from the boundary of t has injectivity radius at least @xmath121 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath489 has injectivity radius at least @xmath121 on the rest of @xmath486 , where it is equal to our original rescaled metric .",

    "using lemma 5.3 , we see that these surfaces have uryson 1-width at least 1 and arbitrarily small hypersphericity .",

    "we then extend this map to all of @xmath516 by straightening each simplex .",
    "it is not hard to check that we get a map with lipshitz constant less than @xmath517 , where c is a constant depending on the dimension of our domain manifold ( which is 6 ) , but not depending on the metric @xmath489 ( because each extension occurs on an approximately euclidean simplex ) .",
    "suppose that f has degree non - zero .",
    "then , we restrict the extension of f to the small area torus in the homology class @xmath509 $ ] .",

    "<S> we now recall some vocabulary , which we will use all through the paper , designed to describe how large and how wide riemannian manifolds are . </S>",
    "<S> the hypersphericity of a riemannian n - manifold m is the supremal r so that there is a contracting map of non - zero degree from m to the n - sphere of radius r. in this paper , we will mostly focus on degree 1 maps , so we define the degree 1 hypersphericity of a riemannian n - manifold m as the supremal r so that there is a contracting map of degree 1 from m to the n - sphere of radius r. the uryson k - width of a metric space x is the infimal w so that there is a continuous map from x to a k - dimensional polyhedron whose fibers have diameter less than w. the main theorem about hypersphericity and uryson width is an estimate by gromov in @xcite that the hypersphericity of an n - manifold is less than its uryson ( n-1)-width .    </S>",

    "<S> since it is not hard to write an efficient algorithm to estimate d to any desired accuracy , we can efficiently estimate the hypersphericity and uryson 1-width of a riemannian 2-sphere up to a factor of twelve .    </S>",
    "<S> we prove theorem 0.1 in section 1 . in the next three sections , </S>",
    "<S> we apply the first theorem to give estimates relating the degree 1 hypersphericity of a surface to other geometric quantities . </S>",
    "<S> while the first theorem is quite easy , some of these applications are more difficult . in the last section of the paper , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the first theorem fails for surfaces of high genus .    in section 2 </S>",
    "<S> , we bound the length of the shortest closed geodesic on a 2-sphere by its degree 1 hypersphericity .    </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath1 has degree 1 hypersphericity less than 1 , then it contains a closed geodesic of length less than 160 .    </S>",
    "<S> this theorem extends a result of croke , who proved in @xcite that if the area of a sphere is less than @xmath0 , then it contains a closed geodesic of length less than 100 . </S>",
    "<S> the main step in the proof is to produce a sufficiently nice family of short curves on @xmath1 . in particular , we prove along the way the following theorem .    if @xmath1 has degree 1 hypersphericity less than 1 , then it admits a map to a tree whose fibers have length less than 120 .    by our first theorem , we already know that @xmath1 admits a map to a tree whose fibers have diameter less than 12 . </S>",
    "<S> it may happen , however , that the fibers are extremely long curves with many wiggles . </S>",

    "<S> , we apply our estimates to surfaces in euclidean space . </S>",
    "<S> our first estimate says that if we slice the unit ball into non - singular surfaces , then one of these surfaces has a large hypersphericity .    </S>",

    "<S> let @xmath11 be a closed oriented surface of genus g and degree 1 hypersphericity less than 1 . </S>",

    "<S> we will give three different examples of surfaces proving this theorem . </S>",
    "<S> the three different examples have small hypersphericity for three different `` reasons '' , and i include them to suggest that the problem of estimating the best lipshitz constant of a degree 1 map from a surface to the unit sphere is a complicated problem , which can involve several different pieces of geometry and topology . </S>",
    "<S> our three examples will use a little homotopy theory , a little lattice theory , and a little bit of the theory of systoles .    </S>",
