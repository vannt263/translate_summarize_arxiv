    "the canonical @xmath2cdm model of cosmic structure formation , in which structures grow from a nearly scale - invariant spectrum of primordial adiabatic perturbations , has achieved many successes .",
    "still , there are discrepancies between observations on subgalactic scales and predictions from n - body simulations of structure and galaxy formation .",
    "we refer to these discrepancies collectively as the `` small - scale crisis '' ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) , which includes the missing - satellite problem @xcite , the cusp - vs - core problem @xcite , and the too - big - to - fail problem @xcite .",
    "while further elucidation of the relevant baryonic physics may help solve these problems @xcite , the small - scale crisis may also imply a suppression of density fluctuations below or around subgalactic scales @xcite .",
    "exotic mechanisms to suppress small - scale power can be classified into those that involve modification of the primordial power in the early universe and those that suppress power at later times .",
    "examples of _ primordial suppression _ are discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , and predict that subgalactic primordial perturbations are suppressed at the _ onset _ of the radiation - dominated era .",
    "examples of _ late - time _ suppression are those discussed , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite ; in such scenarios , subgalactic perturbations are present at the onset of the radiation - dominated era but then suppressed at later times , the relevant scales re - enter the horizon .",
    "these mechanisms include free streaming of dark - matter particles ( e.g. , as in warm dark matter , wdm ) or interactions between and standard - model or hidden particles",
    ".    there has been exploration of different astrophysical consequences of suppressed small - scale power , and constraints to models are already being derived .",
    "for example , provides a particularly well - studied example of a late - time - suppression mechanism , and some recent work @xcite suggests tensions between wdm solutions to the small - scale crisis and observations .",
    "even if a wdm - only scenario for resolving the small - scale crisis is in tension with lyman-@xmath3 observations , a mixture of cold dm and wdm ( mixed dark matter ) can still evade lyman-@xmath3 constraints while helping to solve problems associated with the small - scale crisis @xcite .",
    "there is thus still good reason to consider solutions to the small - scale crisis .    for a primordial suppression ,",
    "the shape of the suppressed spectrum on small scales depends on unknown and largely unconstrained early- physics . in the framework of single - field inflation , for instance",
    ", it is determined by the slope of the inflaton potential @xcite .",
    "hence , even though a wide variety of late - time suppression mechanisms that predict different shapes for a suppressed power spectrum have been proposed , measurement of the _ shape _ of the can not really distinguish whether the suppression is primordial or late - time .    here",
    "we point out that primordial and late - time suppression mechanisms can be distinguished by the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xmath0 distortion @xcite .",
    "such @xmath0 distortions are produced by heating of the primordial plasma from dissipation of small - wavelength fluctuations .",
    "the fourier modes that contribute to the @xmath0 distortions have comoving wavenumbers @xmath4 , and the @xmath0 distortion arises when dissipate at redshifts @xmath5 . in the standard scenario , where the nearly - scale - invariant spectrum of perturbations seen in the @xcite is extrapolated to smaller scales ( as motivated by occam s razor and the simplest models of inflation ) ,",
    "the induced @xmath0 distortion is @xmath6 @xcite .    for primordial suppression",
    ", the value of @xmath0 will be reduced relative to that expected from the standard almost - scale - invariant spectrum .",
    "if the suppression is strong enough , the @xmath0 parameter could even take a _ negative _ value , @xmath7 @xcite , due to the continuous extraction of energy from photons by the nonrelativistic baryons to which they are coupled .",
    "in contrast , for late - time suppression of small - scale perturbations , there are still primordial perturbations to be dissipated , and so the standard prediction is unmodified .",
    "the argument is not entirely trivial , as in many late - time scenarios , the suppression of the matter power spectrum occurs during the @xmath0 era . for example , in the charged - particle - decay scenario @xcite , suppression of the matter power spectrum occurs until roughly 3.5 years after the big bang , at redshifts @xmath8 , right when the @xmath0 distortion is being produced .",
    "this timescale is actually fairly generic , as this is the redshift at which subgalactic scales are entering the horizon .",
    "the crucial point is that the matter density is negligible compared with the radiation density during the @xmath0 era .",
    "there can thus be dramatic smoothing of the matter distribution with little effect on the radiation - density perturbations .",
    "similar arguments apply to the @xmath9 distortion , recently discussed in ref .",
    "the effects of primordial dark - matter isocurvature perturbations on spectral distortions are limited @xcite .    in the next section ,",
    "we calculate @xmath0 assuming a step - type suppression of primordial power below subgalactic scales , and we conclude in section iii .",
    "we relate the primordial power suppression to the @xmath0 distortion as follows .",
    "we employ the following description of primordial suppression in terms of the dimensionless primordial curvature power spectrum , @xmath10 that is , the power is suppressed by @xmath11 for @xmath12 , relative to the standard spectrum @xmath13 with parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "examples of the suppressed primordial spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ power3 ] , where we take @xmath16 and @xmath17 , relevant for small - scale problems .",
    "the above step - type suppression would lead to a step - type suppression of the matter spectrum at low redshifts , similarly to mixed - dm scenarios @xcite .",
    "hence , we can refer to those studies to gain insight into structure formation for the suppressed primordial spectrum we consider here .",
    "however , establishing a precise link between our spectrum and different aspects of the small - scale crisis is beyond the scope of this work , because of potentially important baryonic processes .",
    "thus , we treat @xmath3 and @xmath18 as free parameters and only illustrate that @xmath0 can be significantly smaller than the expected standard value , @xmath6 .",
    "additional information about the precise position of the transition scale might be accessible with future measurements of the exact spectral - distortion shape @xcite .",
    "however , even if we were only to observe a significant suppression of @xmath0 , without additional information the spectral - distortion shape , we could connect the small - scale crisis to primordial suppression .",
    "ultimately , it will be instructive to investigate small - scale problems with simulation of structure formation with the various primordial spectra which are consistent with , e.g. , simultaneous constraints from the lyman-@xmath3 forest and @xmath0 ( and possibly taking into account baryonic processes ) .    the @xmath0 distortion can be estimated @xcite as @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 with @xmath22 ^ 2}{1+[\\hat{k}/260]^{0.3}+\\hat{k}/340 } \\right ) \\right .",

    "this approximation is accurate at the @xmath26 level and slightly underestimates the recovered value for @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "hence , we renormalize the above window function @xmath27 so that @xmath28 when @xmath29 ( i.e. standard fluctuations ) , which is sufficient for our purposes .    ) ] considered in this paper .",
    ", width=321 ]    the values of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath3 are shown in fig .",
    "when @xmath18 is close to @xmath30 and @xmath3 is sufficiently large , @xmath0 becomes negative , approaching @xmath31 . for @xmath32 ,",
    "the asymptotic value is @xmath33 ; that is , the energy injection due to the dissipation of sound waves and energy extraction due to interactions between photons and baryons are balanced .",
    "if in the future @xmath0 is constrained to be smaller than what is expected ( @xmath34 ) , from the dissipation of the standard fluctuations , ( in the figure this corresponds to the limit @xmath35 , ) then it could serve as a smoking gun for some primordial suppression thereby possibly explaining the small - scale crisis .",

    "in contrast , if @xmath18 is relevant to the small - scale crisis and if @xmath3 is sufficiently large , @xmath0 can be negative , approaching @xmath7 for @xmath38 , determined by the energy extraction from photons to baryons due to their coupling.,width=321 ]",
    "the small - scale crisis of @xmath2cdm may imply suppressed matter fluctuations on subgalactic scales .",
    "such a suppression could result from some new physics that operates during inflation or could be the consequence of new dark - matter physics that operates at later times , the relevant distance scales re - enter the horizon during radiation domination .",
    "although the primordial and late - time suppression mechanisms are expected to impact structure formation in a similar fashion , we show here that they could be in principle distinguished by measurement of the @xmath0 distortion to the cmb frequency spectrum .",
    "this is because @xmath0 may be significantly reduced relative to the canonical value @xmath39 if subgalactic power suppression is primordial . for power suppression",
    "sufficiently significant , @xmath0 could even become negative as a consequence of the transfer of energy from photons to baryons . on the other hand , for a late - time suppression , the cmb @xmath0 distortion would not be affected notably since it is mostly determined by primordial fluctuations rather than subhorizon dynamics of dm fluctuations during the radiation - dominated era .",
    "thus , for a late - time suppression , @xmath0 is not expected to differ significantly from the standard positive value .",
    "if @xmath0 is found to be unexpectedly small or negative by future high - sensitivity experiments measuring the energy spectrum of cmb photons , it may serve as a _ smoking gun _ for a primordial suppression .",
    "if the standard prediction for @xmath0 is verified , then it suggests that the small - scale crisis has to do with late - time physics .",
    "if we find @xmath0 to have the standard value , then another possibility , which we leave for future work , is that a matter - radiation isocurvature perturbation , correlated with the adiabatic perturbation , suppressed matter perturbations on small scales while preserving the primordial curvature ( and thus radiation ) perturbation on small scales .    in this paper",
    ", we emphasized that @xmath0 can be small for the primordial suppression scenario .",
    "however , ultimately it will be interesting to study the small - scale problems by n - body simulations for a variety of primordial spectra consistent with existing constraints from , e.g. , lyman-@xmath3 observation , simultaneously calculating @xmath0 for each spectrum , possibly taking into account baryonic processes .",
