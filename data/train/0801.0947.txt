    "since quantum computer and quantum communication can provide more powerful ability than the classical ones @xcite , in the past few years , a variety of systems are explored for the realization of practical quantum information processors . among them",
    "cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) system @xcite and ion trap system @xcite are two of the ideal candidates for quantum computation and quantum communication .",
    "the distinctive feature of these two systems are ( i ) they allow the implementation of quantum gates between any set of ( not necessarily neighboring ) atoms , solid - state qubits  often called artificial atoms , or ions which share a single mode field in cavity qed systems or a collective vibrational state of trapped ions , ( ii ) the atoms or artificial atoms trapped in a high - q cavity or the ions trapped in a potential trap have long decoherence times @xcite . because of these advantages many efforts have been devoted to the implementation of quantum logical gates and the generation of entangled states @xcite . in particular , for cavity qed system several experiments have been reported about the generation of the einstein - podolsky - rosen state @xcite of two atoms , greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state @xcite of three parties ( two atoms plus one cavity mode ) , schrdinger cat state @xcite , and fock state @xcite of a single - mode cavity field .",
    "remarkably , in ion trap system maximally up to eight ions have been entangled @xcite .    in recent years , a special type of multipartite entangled states , so - called graph states @xcite , have become the centre of attention .",
    "they can correspond to mathematical graphs , where each vertex represents a qubit prepared in the state @xmath0 and each edge represents a two - qubit controlled - z gate having been applied to the two connected qubits .",
    "an interesting feature is that many entanglement properties of graph states are closely related to their underlying graphs @xcite . besides their thought - provoking theoretical structure",
    ", graph states have also provided new insights into studies of nonlocality @xcite and become an interesting resource for multiparty quantum communication @xcite .",
    "special instances of graph states are codewords of various quantum error correcting codes @xcite , which are of central importance for protecting quantum states against decoherence in quantum computation @xcite .",
    "in particular , special instances of graph states have served as essential resources for quantum computation @xcite .",
    "recently , much progress with preparation of arbitrary graph states has been made in the linear optics regime and the optical lattice @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , experimental entanglement of six photons in graph states was reported .    in this paper",
    ", we propose an alternative scheme for quantum computation and quantum state engineering based on cavity qed or ion trap .",
    "the main result from this work is twofold : first , we propose a method for realizing a tunable quantum phase gate .",
    "the accumulated conditional phase shift @xmath1 can vary between @xmath2 and @xmath3 by controlling the total effective interaction time .",
    "compared with previous protocols for the tunable quantum phase gates @xcite , our scheme encodes two logical states of a qubit on the two stable low energy states , and the conditional phase shifts are obtained without any real transitions of atomic internal states or cavity - photon or vibration - phonon population . in contrast to the scheme in ref .",
    "@xcite , our method can be directly extended to construct multiple  qubit entangling gates .",
    "second , a more important result here is that our method can be used for effective preparation of graph - state entanglement .",
    "next we assume ( without loss of generality ) that n identical atoms , each having two low levels @xmath4 , @xmath5 and a high level @xmath6 , simultaneously interact with a single - mode cavity and a classical field , as shown in fig . 1 .    both of the cavity mode and the classical pulse are coupled to @xmath7 @xmath6 transition of each atom .",
    "the hamiltonian for the whole system in the interaction picture can be written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the annihilation operator of the cavity mode , @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the detunings of the cavity mode and classical pulse from respective atomic transitions , @xmath12 represents the coupling rate of the jth atom to cavity mode , and @xmath13 is rabi frequency of the classical pulse for the jth atom . in the case of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the high level @xmath16 can be adiabatically eliminated , leading to @xmath17,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "the first and second terms in eq .",
    "( 2 ) are the stark shifts for the level @xmath20 that are induced by the cavity mode and the classical pulse , respectively .",
    "the last term is the coupling between the cavity mode and the classical field assisted by the atoms . in the case of @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ,",
    "the cavity photon is only virtually excited and any two atoms interfere with each other @xcite . for the sake of convenience , we will assume @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are real so that @xmath28 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian is then given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "the last term in eq .",
    "( 3 ) describes the  coupling between atoms j and k mediated by the cavity mode and the classical pulse .",
    "if the cavity field is initially in the vacuum state , the effective hamiltonian reduces to @xmath31    suppose that the two low levels @xmath4 and @xmath32 of each atom represent two logical states of a qubit .",
    "the time evolutions of four logical states for two qubits , under the hamiltonian ( 4 ) , are given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "after the performance of the one - qubit operation @xmath36 @xmath37 , there is @xmath38 thus a conditional phase shift @xmath35 is produced if and only if two atoms both are in the state @xmath39 .",
    "the n times similar operations can accumulate a phase @xmath40 varying between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which is controllable via the total effective interaction time @xmath41 ( @xmath42 denotes the beginning time of the ith operation ) .",
    "@xcite shows that any conditional quantum phase gate is universal , since all quantum computations can be realized by combining it and rotations of individual qubits . for example , with the choice of @xmath43 , a two - qubit controlled - z gate is obtained , which is a familiar two - qubit universal logic gate @xcite .",
    "we note that yi et al .",
    "have proposed a novel scheme for conditional quantum phase gate between two 3-state atoms via simultaneously driven by a single - mode cavity field and a very weak classical field @xcite",
    ". however , there are the following differences between our protocol and that in ref . @xcite .",
    "( a ) our scheme does not need the wave front delay of the classical field between the two atoms corresponds to an odd number of @xmath44 , which require that two atoms are separated from each other by at least half optical wavelength of the classical field .",
    "( b ) our method can be extended to construct multiple  qubit entangling gates , which are used as basic tools for effective generation of graph - state entanglement in next section .",
    "but the scheme in ref .",
    "@xcite is difficult to simultaneously operate a controlled phase gate between two arbitrary atoms coupled to the cavity , due to one ca nt make the wave front delay of the classical field between arbitrary two of several atoms correspond to an odd number of @xmath44 .",
    "( c ) unlike the scheme in ref .",
    "@xcite , our scheme does nt require weak classical field ( @xmath45 for the large detuning .",
    "we first give a brief review of the definition and properties of graph states @xcite .",
    "an n - qubit graph state is defined as the coeigenstate of n independent stabilizer operators @xmath46 , where i denotes qubit i ( each qubit is associated with a vertex of the graph ) , j runs over all the neighbors of the qubit @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , @xmath49 are simply the pauli operators @xmath50 and @xmath51 for qubit @xmath47 . in a graph state ,",
    "the qubits @xmath47 and @xmath52 are called neighbor if they are connected with an edge .",
    "the graph state reduces to a cluster state if the corresponding graph is a periodic lattice @xcite .",
    "each graph can be represented by a diagram in a plane , where each vertex is represented by a point and each edge by an arc joining two not necessarily distinct vertices . in this pictorial representation",
    "many concepts related to graphs can be visualized in a transparent manner .",
    "a graph @xmath53 is local unitary ( lu ) equivalent representation of another graph @xmath54 , if the graph @xmath53 can be transformed into @xmath54 only by local unitary operation .",
    "it has been proved that , by local complementation of a graph @xmath55 at one vertex and leaving the rest of the graph @xmath55 unchanged , a new graph @xmath56 obtained is lu - equivalent representation of the graph @xmath55 .",
    "this is called lu rule @xcite ( or lc rule @xcite ) .",
    "the graph state @xmath53 can be obtained by applying a sequence of commuting unitary two - qubit controlled - z gate @xmath57 to the empty graph @xmath58 : @xmath55 = @xmath59 , where @xmath60 denotes the set of edges in the graph @xmath55 , and @xmath61 . the unitary two - qubit operation @xmath57 on the vertices @xmath9",
    ", @xmath62 adds or removes the edge @xmath63 . in the following , with a combination of the lu rule and the multiple  qubit entangling gates",
    ", we show an efficient scheme for preparation of graph - state entanglement .",
    "_ three - qubit entangling gate_. as shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) , three atoms 1 , 2 , and 3 with the initial state @xmath64 trapped in a cavity are simultaneously driven by the cavity mode and an appropriate classical pulse ( fig .",
    "the state evolution of the three - atom system is governed by @xmath65 where @xmath66 , @xmath30 , and the self - energy terms have been assumed to be corrected by the added classical pulses @xcite .",
    "after the effective interaction time @xmath67 , a three - qubit entangling gate is operated on the three - atom system and a graph state @xmath68 is obtained .",
    "the graph state is lu - equivalent representation of the three - qubit linear cluster .",
    "2(b ) shows that two three - qubit linear clusters are fused into a seven - qubit graph state by a three - qubit entangling gate , which is lu - equivalent representation of a seven - qubit linear cluster . with",
    "sequentially applying the method in fig .",

    "3(b ) shows that with two four - qubit entangling gates one can obtain a seven - qubit graph state , which is lu - equivalent representation of an h - sharp graph .",
    "3(c ) shows that after performing an controlled - z gate on two diagonal vertexes of the graph in fig .",

    "five or more - qubit entangling gate_.five or more atoms simultaneously interact with a cavity mode and an appropriate classical pulse . after the effective interaction time @xmath43",
    ", we obtain a five or more - qubit entangling gate . as sketched in fig .",
    "4(a ) , after applying a five - qubit entangling gate , one can get a five - qubit graph sate , which is lu - equivalent representation of a five - qubit star graph state being equivalent to a five - particle ghz state @xcite .",
    "4(b ) shows that a eight - qubit 2d graph state can be obtianed by applying two five - qubit entangling gates .",
    "4(c ) shows how to effectively generate 2d square lattice cluster states by using the five - qubit entangling gates , which can be used as the essential resource for realization of universal quantum computation @xcite . in fig . 5",
    ", we illustrate a method for effective preparation of three - dimensional ( 3d ) cluster state by sequentially using the seven - qubit entangling gates . in ref .",
    "@xcite , raussendorf et al .",
    "have shown that 3d cluster state is a fault - tolerant fabric of one - way quantum computer .",
    "here we only display a sample of generating some typical graph states .",
    "we believe that it is still effective to generate a more complex graph state by combining the lu rule , the multiple  qubit entangling gates , and any two - qubit controlled - z gate .",
    "the required atomic level configuration and transitions can be achieved in neutral atoms trapped in an optical cavity , solid - state qubits  often called artificial atoms trapped in a microwave cavity , or the ions trapped in the potential trap .",
    "it should be noted that one needs to reach the strong - coupling limit and the lamb - dicke regime in order to perform the gate successfully . in optical cavity qed system ,",
    "strong - coupling limit and localization to the ground state of motion for an atom trapped in an optical cavity are still a challenging pursuit @xcite .",
    "conversely , for the solid - state system or ion - trap system , strong - coupling and lamb - dicke limit can be easier to achieve @xcite . in the past few years , much attention has been paid to superconducting devices such as cooper pair boxes , josephson junctions , and superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) , since these solid - state artificial atoms are relatively easy to scale up and have been demonstrated to have relatively long decoherence time @xcite .",
    "recently , for squid system , many methods for realizing a single - qubit arbitrary rotation gate and a two - qubit controlled - not ( or controlled - z gate ) have been presented @xcite",
    ". any particular squid qubit operation can be realized by adjusting level structure of individual qubit @xcite . in the following",
    "we first discuss that it is possible to experimentally demonstrate our scheme with the squids in a microwave cavity .",
    "typically , for squids interacting with a high - q microwave cavity , the coupling constant is @xmath72 , the photon lifetime ( the energy relaxation time of excited state @xmath6 ) is @xmath73 @xcite . with the choices of @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , we have @xmath77  @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , which satisfy the conditions @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "our calculations show that ( i ) the occupation probability of the excited state @xmath6 is @xmath86 @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) , thus the effective energy relaxation time is @xmath89 ; ( ii ) the occupation probability of the photon is @xmath90 @xmath87 ( @xmath91 ) , thus the effective photon lifetime is @xmath92 ; ( iii ) the required effective interaction time for a two - qubit controlled - z gate or a multiple  qubit entangling gate is @xmath93 .",
    "therefore , it is possible to perform  several two - qubit controlled - z gates or multiple  qubit entangling gates within the decoherence time @xmath94 .    in the ion - trap system ,",
    "several ions are assumed to be confined in a linear trap @xcite and have been cooled to the ground state .",
    "the ions are simultaneously excited by two laser fields ( for operating a controlled phase gate between two or several arbitrary ions , one needs single laser pulses to address two or several arbitrary ions individually , which have been demonstrated in the experiment @xcite ) .",
    "one is ( off - resonantly ) tuned to the first lower vibrational side and the other is insensitive to the motion with appropriate frequency @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . in the lamb - dicke limit",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is then again described by eq .",
    "( 1 ) , except now @xmath9 is the annihilation operator of the collective vibrational mode instead of the cavity mode . considering experimental parameters of ion experiments at ref .",
    "@xcite , we can achieve an effective coupling rate @xmath95 .",
    "so the required effective interaction time for a two - qubit controlled - z gate or a multiple  qubit entangling gate is @xmath96 , shorter than the typical motional decoherence time @xmath97",
    "@xmath98    in summary , we have proposed a scheme to realize a tunable quantum phase gate with three - level atoms or artificial atoms or ions simultaneously interacting with a quantum data bus such as a single mode field in cavity qed system , or a collective vibrational state of trapped ions .",
    "the distinct advantages of our scheme are that there is no cavity - photon population involved and the atoms are always in their low levels .",
    "in addition , our method can be extended to construct multiple  qubit graph - state entanglement .",
    "the method opens up a prospect to generate large - scale graph state in cavity qed system and ion trap system .",
