    "recent works demonstrated that the quantum procedures can be examined more clearly using a topological approach rather than the classical presentations which utilize the matrices of complex numbers in an orderly manner ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in this new approach pioneered by the works of abramsky and coecke one",
    "replaces the matrices with geometrical primitives .",
    "vicary has recently provided the topological analysis of deutsch - jozsa , hidden subgroup and single - shot grover algorithms by overcoming the difficulties that come from the use of an oracle and group representation theory @xcite .",
    "his work not only enable new and simple proofs of correctness but also produce new generalizations of these algorithms .    in @xcite ,",
    "the author focuses on the case where a single iteration of the grover algorithm is sufficient to find a marked element in a set .",
    "this algorithm can work correctly if exactly @xmath0 of the elements are marked . in this paper",
    ", we consider in a similar fashion the more general case where one element is marked in a set @xmath1 of size @xmath2 .",
    "we perform @xmath3 iteration using topological formalism .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we explain conventional grover algorithm .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the topological semantics that we use in the paper .",
    "finally , we give the presentation of the grover algorithm using topological semantics and prove its correctness in section 4 .",
    "grover search algorithm is introduced to find a marked element in an array @xmath4 of size @xmath5 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the classical algorithms do this job in @xmath6 queries in average while it takes @xmath3 queries for grover search algorithm .",
    "the marked element @xmath7 is defined using an indicator function @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the group of integers under addition modulo @xmath10 . here",
    "@xmath11 is equal to @xmath12 for @xmath13 and to @xmath14 for all other elements of @xmath1 .",
    "we then define the unitary operator @xmath15 as follows : @xmath16 here @xmath17 is an element of @xmath1 and @xmath18 is an element of @xmath9 .",
    "the symbol @xmath19 is the addition in the group @xmath9 .",
    "we can now introduce the quantum circuit for the grover algorithm as follows :        where @xmath20 is @xmath21-fold hadamard gate and the unitary matrix @xmath22 is the inversion about the mean . @xmath23 and @xmath22 combined together separates the desired state after @xmath3 consecutive applications .",
    "in other words , after @xmath3th step the probability of measuring any state except @xmath7 will be close to zero while probability of measuring @xmath7 will be greater than @xmath24 .",
    "hence , the final measurement in the algorithm will give us the desired element @xmath7 .",
    "in this section we present topological semantics that we need to build the grover algorithm .",
    "these geometric primitives correspond to properties of finite groups and finite sets .",
    "the content of this section can be found in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "one can also refer to @xcite and @xcite for the mathematical foundation of the notation .    here",
    "we start with the identity map on a finite hilbert spaces .",
    "this is represented by a vertical wire .",
    "the following diagram represent a linear map @xmath25        the identity on the @xmath12-dimensional hilbert space is represented as the empty diagram : one can change the relative heights of the boxes and move the components around .",
    "let @xmath26 $ ] be the complex vector space whose basis elements are the elements of a finite set @xmath1 .",
    "for the sake of brevity , we denote this vector space by @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath27 be a basis element of @xmath1 .",
    "we define the maps @xmath28 and @xmath29 as follows : @xmath30 @xmath31 the maps @xmath32 and @xmath33 gives @xmath1 a commutative algebra structure and they are represented as follows :        their adjoints @xmath34 and @xmath35 are constructed in the following way :        a function @xmath36 between finite sets extends to a linear map by @xmath37 .",
    "the following diagram corresponds to this function :        we have also morphisms with following two conditions        these are called _ comonoid homomorphism _ conditions .",
    "a chosen element @xmath38 corresponds to a function @xmath39 , which we denote graphically as :        the deletion operator @xmath35 reduce the elements to unit scalars :        @xmath17 and its adjoint @xmath40 are related as follows :        let @xmath41 be a group . linearizing the multiplication function @xmath42 and unit element @xmath43 , we obtain the following diagrams        for finite group @xmath41 , the representations are defined by the maps @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the algebra of @xmath46 matrices .",
    "the representations have the following properties :        we finalize this section with the following equation which is the result of basic theorems in representation theory ( the reader can refer to @xcite for detailed explanation ) :        here the sum is over equivalence classes of irreducible representations of @xmath41 and @xmath47 is adjoint of an irreducible representation .",
    "the topological structure of the ( multi - step ) grover algorithm as follows :        the projective measurement is performed in the base system @xmath48 . @xmath49 corresponding the inversion about the mean ( i.e. @xmath22 ) can be decomposed :        next we use the last identity of the section 3 to convert the algorithm to the following form :        we now neglegt second part of this system as it is a product state . using the decomposition of @xmath49 we rewrite the system :            the last equality is result of the identities stated in the last section .",
    "it is clear that for the representation @xmath50 we have @xmath51 as a factor in our final measurement . for an unmarked element @xmath52",
    ", we obtain the factor @xmath53 in the measurement as a result of the following topological identity :        hence for such an unmarked element we will get the following result : @xmath54\\ ] ] here the first summand in the bracket is the result of the figures which have one @xmath55 box while the second summand is from the figures without any @xmath55 boxes .",
    "this result can be simplified to the following expression : @xmath56 hence @xmath57 is the probability of measuring an unmarked element .",
    "we note that @xmath57 is less than @xmath24 and approaches to zero as @xmath21 gets larger .",
    "the find the probability for the marked element we now calculate the total probability for unmarked elements .",
    "since there are @xmath58 unmarked elements , we consider the value @xmath59 .",
    "it is straightforward to check this value is less than @xmath24 and actually goes to zero as @xmath21 gets larger .",
    "this implies that the probability of measuring the marked element will be at least @xmath24 after @xmath3 iterations .",
    "this proves the the correctness of the algorithm .",
    "one can also see the reason why the algorithm is repeated @xmath3 times by examining the expression @xmath60 where the power of the terms are the result of the the number of the iteration .",
    "in this paper , we present multi - shot grover search algorithm using a topological semantics originated from categorical quantum mechanics program .",
