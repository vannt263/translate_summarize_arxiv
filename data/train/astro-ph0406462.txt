    "for many years , h  i and optical rotation curves have been used to establish the presence of dark matter halos around spiral galaxies @xcite . however , the mass profiles of these halos are still in doubt : from the rotation curves alone , it is impossible to decouple the gravitational contribution of the galaxy s visible disk mass from that of its dark halo (  see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "most investigations begin with the assumption that a disk s mass - to - light ratio is constant with radius @xcite , but evidence in support of this hypothesis is limited .",
    "in fact , independent estimates of disk mass exist for only a handful of spirals @xcite , and in these systems , the data are restricted to the galaxies inner @xmath5  scale lengths .",
    "thus , while the information to date is consistent with the constant mass - to - light ratio hypothesis , the applicability of these studies to the dark - matter - dominated outer regions of spirals is limited .    the best way to independently determine",
    "the mass within a spiral s disk is through the motions of its old disk stars .",
    "however , the traditional approach to doing this via absorption - line spectroscopy is extremely challenging . because the surface brightness of spiral galaxies declines exponentially with radius , observations at large radii are quite demanding and require intricate procedures for data reduction .",
    "this limits the effectiveness of the technique to the inner one or two disk scale lengths .",
    "fortunately , there is an alternative . instead of measuring the doppler widths of integrated starlight , one can derive velocity dispersions directly from the motions of individual stars .",
    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) are the ideal targets for this purpose .",
    "pne are excellent tracers of the galactic light @xcite , easily identifiable via their strong [ o  iii ] @xmath0 emission and distinctive @xmath14 ratio @xcite , and measurable to a precision of a few  via medium dispersion spectrographs . moreover , because the progenitors of pne are intermediate and low mass stars , their velocity dispersion is representative of the old components of a galactic disk .",
    "here we describe a photometric and spectroscopic survey of the planetary nebula system of the local group spiral galaxy m33 ( ngc  598 ) .",
    "m33 is an excellent target for such an investigation .",
    "first , the galaxy is nearby , making large numbers of planetaries available for study .",
    "second , since m33 s photometric structure is well known at both optical @xcite and infrared @xcite wavelengths , information is available on the distribution of both the young and old stars of the system . finally , m33 s h  i rotation curve is well - measured out to @xmath15  kpc ( @xmath16  disk scale lengths ) .",
    "consequently , detailed models exist for the orientation of the galactic disk and the system s total potential @xcite .",
    "we begin our study by describing our photometric survey of the galaxy , and comparing our [ o  iii ] @xmath0 and h@xmath17 pn measurements to those of @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that there is generally good agreement between the samples , although our [ o  iii ] @xmath0 magnitudes are systematically brighter than the @xcite values by @xmath18  mag",
    ". in section 3 , we present m33 s [ o  iii ] @xmath0 planetary nebula luminosity function ( pnlf ) and show that at faint magnitudes , the function has the same non - monotonic behavior as the pnlf of the small magellanic cloud .",
    "we interpret this turnover as a population effect and speculate on how the shape of the pnlf can be used to probe the mix of stellar populations within a galaxy . in section  4 ,",
    "we use our data to derive a new pnlf - based distance to the galaxy , and discuss a possible reason for the @xmath19 difference between our measurement and that inferred from the galaxy s cepheid variables .    after analyzing the photometric data",
    ", we describe our spectroscopic survey of the galaxy s planetary nebula system . in section 5",
    ", we detail our observing and reduction procedures , and quantify the errors in our velocity measurements . in sections 6 and 7",
    ", we use these data to examine the stellar kinematics of the galaxy .",
    "we present the system s line - of - sight velocity dispersion , estimate the stellar asymmetric drift , and use the epicyclic approximation to model the galaxy s velocity ellipsoid .",
    "we show that the line - of - sight velocity dispersion of m33 s planetaries varies very little with galactic radius , and that this is due to a combination of factors , including a decline in the system s radial velocity dispersion at small galactocentric distances and a gradient in the ratio of the system s vertical to radial velocity dispersion .",
    "we also show that m33 s vertical velocity dispersion decreases with a scale length that is greater than that of the galaxy s infrared light . in section 8 ,",
    "we discuss possible systematic errors which may effect our result , including the variation of the pn scale height with galactocentric distance .",
    "finally , we use our results to estimate the surface mass density of m33 s disk , and constrain the radial profile of the galaxy s dark halo .",
    "m33 s pn candidates were identified on kitt peak 4  m telescope mosaic ccd images taken as part of the noao local group galaxies survey program @xcite .",
    "this dataset consists of deep broad- ( _ ubvri _ ) and narrow- ( [ o  iii ] , [ s  ii ] , and h@xmath17 + [ n  ii ] ) band images of 10 star - forming galaxies of the local group . our program made use of the survey s m33 frames in [ o  iii ] @xmath0 , h@xmath17 , @xmath20 , and @xmath10 .",
    "these data cover a @xmath21 region of the galaxy in three overlapping @xmath22 fields , and extend out to a radius of @xmath6  kpc , or four times the galaxy s disk scale length in blue light @xcite .",
    "our survey region is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] ; the properties of the survey frames are summarized in table  [ tab1 ] .    to place the @xcite survey frames on a standard system , additional exposures in [ o  iii ]",
    "@xmath0 ( 900  s ) and h@xmath17 ( 600  s ) were taken with the same telescope / instrument setup on the ut nights of 2001 dec 22 and 24 .",
    "the seeing during these observations was moderately poor , @xmath23 in [ o  iii ] and @xmath24 in h@xmath17 , but the sky was photometric , and images of the @xcite spectrophotometric standards bd+28  4211 and feige  110 were acquired immediately before and after the exposures .",
    "these supplemental images were bias - subtracted , flat - fielded , and remapped onto the tangent plane using the mscred routines within iraf @xcite .",
    "the latter two steps were performed after the iterative subtraction of the telescope s ghost pupil from the nights dome flats .",
    "pn candidates were identified by blinking the on - band [ o  iii ] @xmath0 and h@xmath17 survey images against their @xmath10-band counterparts .",
    "all spatially unresolved emission - line objects with little or no continuum flux were classified as planetary nebula candidates . because medium band - width continuum images were not part of the @xcite survey , this condition effectively meant that all pn candidates had to be either invisible in @xmath10 , or have an instrumental @xmath25 color less than @xmath26 ( the ratio of the filters bandpasses , corrected for transmission differences and the inclusion of [ o  iii ] @xmath27 in the @xmath10 filter ) .",
    "since the seeing on the survey frames was generally very good , @xmath28 ( @xmath7  pc ) in [ o  iii ] @xmath0 and @xmath29 ( or @xmath26  pc ) in h@xmath17 , this simple classification scheme was generally unambiguous . to confirm the nature of the few sources with instrumental colors uncomfortably close to the discrimination threshold ,  with @xmath30",
    ", we also examined their appearance on the survey s @xmath20 frames . those objects with @xmath20-band",
    "fluxes close to that expected from a b main sequence star were classified as h  ii regions and eliminated from the analysis .",
    "we note that under these criteria , the two objects closest to our @xmath20-magnitude threshold are @xmath31  mag brighter in @xmath20 than any other pn in our sample",
    ".    once found , the pn candidates on each [ o  iii ] frame were measured astrometrically using a grid of @xmath32  reference stars from the usno - a2.0 catalog @xcite .",
    "the formal internal errors of our plate solutions were @xmath33 in both right ascension and declination",
    ". however , since m33 s nuclear field overlapped the survey s northern and southern fields by 50% , almost two - thirds of our pn candidates appeared in two ( or three ) frames , and thus could be measured multiple times .",
    "the standard astrometric error between these measurements , @xmath34 , is slightly better than the internal errors of the individual plate solutions .",
    "this suggests that part of @xmath33 scatter in the solutions comes from the proper motions of the reference stars , and that our relative astrometry is probably good to better than @xmath35 .",
    "relative [ o  iii ] @xmath0 and h@xmath17 photometry of the pn candidates and several bright field stars was accomplished using the daophot point - spread - function fitting ( psf ) routines within iraf @xcite .",
    "our photometry was then checked by using daophot s substar option to subtract off a scaled - psf representation of each pn from its position on the frame .",
    "an examination of the residuals revealed that , while the vast majority of the subtractions were excellent , a few objects in or near the galaxy s spiral arms were slightly under- or over - subtracted , typically by @xmath36  mag .",
    "the cause of this error was an incorrect estimate of the galactic background , which ( particularly in h@xmath17 ) often included irregular h  ii regions , supernova remnants , and diffuse knots of emission . when this occurred , the pn magnitudes were manually adjusted until the residuals of the subtractions appeared reasonable .    after determining the raw pn instrumental magnitudes on each frame ,",
    "the data were merged onto a common system by solving the least - squares condition required to match the magnitudes of stars in the regions of field overlap @xcite .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes were then placed on the standard ab system by using the dec 2001 data to compare large aperture measurements of field stars to similar measurements made of the @xcite spectrophotometric standards .",
    "we estimate the error associated with this step to be @xmath37  mag .",
    "finally , to transform the measured ab magnitudes to monochromatic fluxes , we blue - shifted the transmission curves of the [ o  iii ] @xmath0 and h@xmath17 filters to correct for their temperature at the telescope , and applied the photometric procedures for emission - line objects described in @xcite and @xcite . in doing so , we assumed that m33 s pne have a mean heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath38  and a dispersion of @xmath39  about that mean .",
    "of course , the latter value is not strictly applicable to a rotating disk galaxy , but the error introduced by the peculiar velocity of an individual pne is never more than 0.01  mag .",
    "table  [ tab2 ] lists the positions and emission - line strengths of our 152  pn candidates .",
    "the [ o  iii ] @xmath0 magnitudes in the table are related to monochromatic flux by @xmath40 where the flux is given in ergs  @xmath41  s@xmath42 @xcite . our typical photometric errors ,",
    "as derived internally from daophot and externally from objects with multiple measurements , are given in table  [ tab3 ] .",
    "we note that a catalog of m33 pne has previously been published @xcite .",
    "the two datasets agree reasonably well . except for a few anomalous outliers ,",
    "the positions of pne common to the two surveys are virtually identical : in right ascension and declination , our values are systematically larger than the @xcite measurements by @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively , and the overall dispersion between individual coordinates is @xmath45 .",
    "similarly , in h@xmath17 , there is little systematic difference between the photometry of the two surveys . on average , our h@xmath17+[n  ii ] log fluxes are @xmath46  mag fainter than those of @xcite , and ,",
    "while the dispersion between the measurements is rather large ( @xmath47  mag for objects with log fluxes greater than @xmath48 ) , this may partly be due to the differing contributions of [ n  ii ] within the filters bandpasses .",
    "in fact , the only significant difference between the two surveys is in the [ o  iii ] @xmath0 zero point .",
    "although our [ o  iii ] @xmath0 magnitudes agree with those of @xcite in the relative sense ( the dispersion between the two measurements is @xmath36  mag for objects brighter than @xmath49 ) , the zero point of our system is systematically brighter by @xmath50  mag .",
    "this offset and the dispersion between the measurements is shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "those @xcite pn candidates that were not recovered in our survey are listed in table  [ tab4 ] , along with the probable reason for the discrepancy .",
    "the implied fraction of contaminants ( @xmath51 ) is consistent with the 28% contamination rate estimated by @xcite from follow - up spectrophotometry of the h@xmath17 , [ n  ii ] , and [ s  ii ] lines of 36  pn candidates .",
    "however , we note that there are some discrepancies for individual objects .",
    "specifically , @xcite object # 8 , which is classified by @xcite as a planetary nebula , is excluded from our sample on the basis of its detectable continuum emission and [ o  iii ] @xmath0 to h@xmath17+[n  ii ] line ratio ( see below ) .",
    "conversely , @xcite objects # 41 and 42 are included in our study , even though they are classified by @xcite as probable supernova remnants .",
    "are all the pn candidates listed in table  [ tab2 ] genuine ? at m33 s cepheid distance of @xmath52  kpc @xcite , our typical seeing of @xmath53 in [ o  iii ] @xmath0 and @xmath29 in + [ n  ii ] implies that all h  ii regions or supernova remnants greater than @xmath26  pc in size are resolved .",
    "this is significantly better than the limit of @xmath54  pc associated with the poorer seeing exposures of the @xcite survey , and as the catalog of @xcite demonstrates , the density of h  ii regions in m33 decreases rapidly over this range .",
    "moreover , since the @xcite survey frames reach a limiting magnitude of @xmath55 , all of m33 s stars brighter than @xmath56 are visible via their continuum . consequently , unless an h  ii region is excited by a lone main sequence star with spectral type b3 or later , it will not make it into our sample . finally , at the bright end of the [ o  iii ]",
    "@xmath0 luminosity function , the excitation properties of our objects demonstrate that the fraction of contaminants is negligible .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , planetary nebulae inhabit a distinctive cone in [ o  iii ] @xmath0-h@xmath17+[n  ii ] emission - line space . while faint pne ( those more than @xmath26  mag down the [ o  iii ] @xmath0 luminosity function ) can have [ o  iii ] @xmath0 to + [ n  ii ] line ratios anywhere between @xmath57 , pne in the top @xmath58  mag of the pnlf all have @xmath59 .",
    "this contrasts with the great majority of compact h  ii regions and supernova remnants , which typically have @xmath60 @xcite . as figure  [ fig3 ] illustrates , _ all _ of our [ o  iii]-bright",
    "pn candidates are high - excitation objects .",
    "late - type b - stars can not create nebulae with such high [ o  iii ] to h@xmath17 ratios : the central stars of all our candidates must be extremely hot , and optically faint . taken together , the above arguments strongly suggest that the contamination fraction in our sample is extremely low .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig4 ] displays m33 s [ o  iii ] @xmath0 planetary nebula luminosity function .",
    "the sharp cutoff at the bright end of the distribution is obvious , as is the function s slow decline at fainter magnitudes .",
    "remarkably , both features are consistent throughout the galaxy .",
    "m33 has a sizable metallicity gradient ( @xmath61  dex  kpc@xmath42 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the mean oxygen abundance of pne in the galaxy s inner disk ( @xmath62 ) is likely to be @xmath63  dex larger than that of pne outside this radius . yet , as the middle and lower panels of figure  [ fig4 ] show , the [ o  iii ] @xmath0 luminosity functions of the two samples are statistically identical .",
    "this constancy supports the conclusion of @xcite that the pnlf cutoff is independent of metallicity for all but the most metal poor systems .    a second interesting feature exhibited in figure  [ fig4 ] is the decline in the pnlf at magnitudes fainter than @xmath64 .",
    "this roll over is partially real , and partially due to photometric incompleteness . to determine the effect of incompleteness",
    ", we began by excluding pne located within @xmath65 of the galaxy s nucleus ; object detections in this region are difficult due to the bright , irregular features of the galactic background .",
    "we then measured the local sky associated with each remaining object , identified the worst ( most uncertain ) background in the sample , and computed the signal - to - noise each pn would have if it were projected on that background .",
    "artificial star experiments have shown that pn identifications become incomplete when the signal - to - noise of a detection drops below @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "our putative signal - to - noise measurements therefore translate directly into a completeness limit .",
    "our completeness limit , @xmath66 , is more than a magnitude fainter than the point where the observed pnlf begins to decline .",
    "we can confirm the reality of the dip at @xmath49 by comparing the radial distribution of `` bright '' pne ( @xmath67 ) to a similar distribution for pne with @xmath68 .",
    "if incompleteness were important , then we might expect the latter sample to be missing pne at small radii , where detections are more difficult due to the brighter surface brightness of the underlying galaxy . as figure",
    "[ fig5 ] ( and the kolmogorov - smirnov statistic ) show , this is not the case : outside of the inner @xmath69 , the cumulative radial distributions for `` bright '' and `` faint '' pne are identical .",
    "the agreement between the two distributions demonstrates that our estimate of the detection limit is reasonable and the decline in the luminosity function at @xmath49 is real .",
    "the decrease in the luminosity function at fainter magnitudes , though unexpected , is not difficult to explain .",
    "in fact , there are at least two possible mechanisms which , in theory , can produce a non - monotonic pnlf .",
    "the first is internal extinction in the host galaxy .",
    "the central extinction in m33 is @xmath70  mag and there is a significant amount of dust distributed throughout the galaxy s disk @xcite . because the scale height of pne should be larger than that of the interstellar medium @xcite",
    ", one would expect the bright end of the pnlf to be dominated by objects foreground to the dust layer .",
    "the observation of bright pne above the dust lanes of the edge - on spirals ngc  891 @xcite and ngc  4565 @xcite support this idea .",
    "however , at fainter magnitudes , the contribution of extincted pne may conceivably be enough to distort the shape of the pnlf and cause the observed luminosity function to turn over .    to investigate this possibility , we modeled the disk of m33 as an isothermal sheet of stars ( scale height @xmath71 ) containing an embedded layer of dust ( scale height @xmath72 ) .",
    "we then adopted the analytic form of the pnlf proposed by @xcite @xmath73 and performed a series of monte carlo experiments , in which the ratio of the two scale heights was allowed to vary between @xmath74 , and the total extinction ranged between @xmath75 . in no case did the mixture of dust and stars produce a non - monotonic pnlf .",
    "if the layer of dust is thick enough and if the total amount of extinction is large , then both the number of pne and the apparent magnitude of the pnlf cutoff may be affected by extinction .",
    "however , our analysis suggests that internal extinction , by itself , can not turn the exponentially increasing pnlf of equation ( 2 ) into the peaked luminosity function displayed in figure  [ fig4 ] .    an alternative explanation for m33 s pnlf comes from stellar evolution .",
    "according to the initial - mass final - mass relation @xcite , old stellar populations produce low - mass central stars with evolutionary timescales much longer than the timescale for nebular expansion @xcite .",
    "to a first approximation , such objects can be modeled as non - evolving central stars surrounded by freely expanding gaseous envelopes .",
    "the [ o  iii ] @xmath0 emission of these pne will decrease with time , @xmath76 , following the relation @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the number density of o@xmath79 ions , @xmath80 is the electron density , @xmath10 , the volume of the nebula , and @xmath81 , the nebular radius .",
    "for an ensemble of objects , the number of pne with [ o  iii ] @xmath0 magnitudes between @xmath82 and @xmath83 will then be @xmath84 this is the exponential law first proposed by @xcite and used by @xcite in their pnlf calculations .",
    "however , it may not be applicable for younger stellar populations . in these systems",
    ", the typical planetary nebula will have a higher mass core , and a much shorter timescale for stellar evolution .",
    "if this timescale is comparable to , or shorter than , the timescale for envelope expansion , then a pn s [ o  iii ] @xmath0 evolution will be driven by the luminosity evolution of its central star , rather than the expansion of its nebula . since post - agb stars spend a relatively long time at high luminosity ( as they cross they hr diagram at the end of shell burning ) , a short time at intermediate luminosity ( when nuclear reactions stop ) , and a long time at low luminosity ( as their cooling rate slows ) , the pnlf of high - mass objects will be double - peaked , and similar to that calculated for post - agb stars by @xcite .    of course",
    ", in order to model real systems , one must include central star evolution , nebular expansion , and gas dynamics in the analysis , as well as the mix of stellar populations within a galaxy ( see * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , these simple arguments do explain the different pnlfs found in local group galaxies .",
    "as figure  [ fig6 ] demonstrates , the low - mass stars of m31 s bulge have a pnlf that is well - represented at the faint end by an exponential @xcite .",
    "conversely , m33 and the smc are actively forming stars and their pnlfs are consistent with the bimodal distribution of @xcite . given the distinctive nature of the two limiting cases , it is possible that the strength of the `` dip '' in the luminosity function may someday be a useful probe of stellar populations which are otherwise difficult to observe .",
    "although the shape of the pnlf at fainter magnitudes may change with time , the absolute magnitude of the function s bright - end cutoff stays amazingly constant @xcite .",
    "whether this is due to convergence in the initial mass - final mass relation @xcite , a fortuitous correlation between central star uv flux and circumstellar extinction @xcite , or the contribution of some other pn - like object @xcite is unclear .",
    "nevertheless , the insensitivity of the pnlf cutoff to population age and metallicity makes the feature extremely useful as an extragalactic standard candle .    to derive m33 s pnlf distance and its formal uncertainty , we followed the procedures of @xcite .",
    "we took the analytic form of the pnlf given in equation ( 2 ) , convolved it with the photometric error vs.  magnitude relation of table  [ tab3 ] , and fit the resultant curve to the data via the method of maximum likelihood .",
    "since this empirical law assumes a monotonically increasing pnlf at faint magnitudes , we limited the range of the fit to @xmath85 .",
    "in addition , in order to correct for foreground galactic extinction , we adopted the dirbe / iras - based reddening value of @xmath1 @xcite and used the relation of @xcite with @xmath86 to go from differential to total @xmath0 extinction . assuming an absolute magnitude for the pnlf cutoff of @xmath87 @xcite , the most likely distance to m33 is @xmath88 ( 0.94  mpc ) with a formal fitting error of @xmath89@xmath90  mag . when we include the systematic errors associated with the observation s photometric zero point ( 0.03  mag ) , the filter response curve ( 0.03  mag ) , and the galactic foreground extinction ( @xmath91 ;",
    "* ) , m33 s most likely pnlf distance modulus becomes @xmath2 , or @xmath3  mpc .",
    "our pnlf distance modulus of @xmath2 is 0.30  mag larger than m33 s cepheid distance modulus of @xmath92 .",
    "if these uncertainties are accurate , then a simple propagation of errors @xcite implies that the two measurements are discrepant at the @xmath93 level .",
    "there are two possible explanations for this discrepancy .",
    "the first involves a metallicity dependence in either ( or both ) of the distance indicators .",
    "thirteen galaxies have both pnlf and cepheid distance measurements , and a detailed analysis of these data has been performed by @xcite .",
    "their results are striking : except for the most metal - poor systems , the distance residuals are perfectly consistent with the internal uncertainties of the methods .",
    "moreover , although a systematic shift is seen in low - metallicity ( [ o / h ] @xmath94 ) systems , the offset is exactly that predicted for the pnlf by @xcite .",
    "this agreement leaves little room for further metallicity corrections in either the pnlf or cepheid methods .",
    "nevertheless , since our distance estimate to m33 assumes @xmath87 , it is possible that metallicity does play a role in the distance discrepancy .",
    "however , in order to do so , the mean oxygen abundance of the pne in our sample must be @xmath95  dex below that of the large magellanic cloud .",
    "the data of @xcite show that this is unlikely : only in the outermost regions of the galaxy do the h  ii region abundances drop to this level .",
    "moreover , if @xmath96 were being affected by metallicity , the strong abundance gradient across the galaxy would cause our measurement of @xmath97 in m33 s outer disk to be fainter than that of the inner disk . as figure  [ fig4 ] demonstrates ,",
    "this is not observed .",
    "in fact , the pnlf cutoff for the sample of pne with @xmath98 is marginally brighter than that for the pne inside this radius ( by @xmath99  mag ) .",
    "this constancy strongly suggests that the low metallicity of m33 is not causing us to overestimate @xmath96 and the distance to the galaxy .    as pointed out by @xcite ,",
    "a more likely explanation for m33 s distance discrepancy involves divergent assumptions about the galaxy s internal reddening .",
    "m33 s cepheid distance uses an extinction estimate that is derived from multicolor photometry of the cepheids themselves @xcite , while the pnlf method assumes the dirbe / iras galactic value .",
    "the difference between these values , @xmath100 , is one of the largest observed for any cepheid galaxy . if we were simply to adopt the cepheid reddening estimate of @xmath101 ( as did",
    "* ) , or if the internal reddening were reduced to one typical of other cepheid galaxies , the pnlf and cepheid distance indicators would be in much better agreement .",
    "additional support for this hypothesis comes from the galaxy s red giant stars .",
    "the distance moduli derived by @xcite using the tip of the red giant branch ( @xmath102 ( random ) @xmath103 ( systematic ) ) and the location of the red clump ( @xmath104 ( random ) @xmath105 ( systematic ) ) are both consistent with the pnlf value .",
    "the radial velocities of m33 s planetary nebulae were measured with the wiyn telescope , the hydra bench spectrograph , and a 600  lines  mm@xmath42 grating blazed at @xmath106 in first order . most of the pne were observed on the photometric nights of 2002 oct 3 - 5 , with the @xmath107 red fiber cable and a telescope - instrument combination which produced spectra with 2.8     ( 168  ) resolution and 1.4    pixel@xmath42 dispersion over the wavelength range between 4500    and 7000   .",
    "the data were taken using six fiber setups , each of which targeted @xmath108  pne with @xmath109  fibers devoted to the sky .",
    "the total exposure time for each setup was @xmath110  hours , and , in order to allow for the removal of cosmic rays and other instrumental artifacts , the integrations were subdivided into a series of 30  min exposures . to provide a check on the repeatability of the measurements , @xmath111 of the pne",
    "were observed multiple times , and 7 pne , ranging in brightness between @xmath112 were targeted in four or more setups .    to supplement these data , additional spectra for 24  pn candidates",
    "were obtained by r. chandar and h. ford on the nights of 2003 jan 3 - 5 using hydra s @xmath113 blue fiber cable and a 400  lines  mm@xmath42 grating blazed in first order at @xmath114 .",
    "these data , which covered the wavelength range between 3660    and 6860   , had a slightly lower dispersion than the oct 2002 data ( @xmath115    resolution at 1.56    pixel@xmath42 ) , but longer ( @xmath109  hr ) exposure times partially compensated for this drawback .",
    "these jan 2003 observations yielded three additional pn velocities , and reduced the measurement errors of 21 other objects .",
    "data reduction was accomplished with the dohydra task within iraf .",
    "flat - fielding was performed using dome flat exposures obtained at the beginning of each night , and wavelength calibrations were found using a series of cuar comparison arcs taken before , during , and after the science exposures of each setup .",
    "the solutions derived from these comparison arcs had a rms dispersion of @xmath37    ( @xmath5  ) and were stable throughout each setup .",
    "next , the spectra were linearized to a common wavelength scale , and sky subtracted using an average sky spectrum determined from the setup s sky fibers . because our observations focussed on regions of the spectrum well away from any airglow emission , and were performed during dark time at moderately high ( @xmath116 ) dispersion , the details of this subtraction make very little difference to the final result",
    "after sky subtraction , the individual exposures of each setup were co - added and shifted into the barycentric rest frame to produce a single summed spectrum for each object .",
    "pn radial velocities were derived in a two step process .",
    "first we obtained an interim velocity for each pne using the centroids of the bright emission lines of [ o  iii ] @xmath117 , h@xmath17 , h@xmath118 , and ( when possible ) [ n  ii ] @xmath119 .",
    "we then used these velocities to create an ultra - high signal - to - noise pn template by shifting all of the spectra into the rest frame and co - adding the data . using this template",
    ", we then determined our final pn velocities by cross - correlating the individual spectra against the template spectrum with the xcsao task of the rvsao package @xcite of iraf . generally speaking , for faint emission - line objects , velocities derived in this way are slightly more accurate than velocities found from the weighted average of individual emission - line measurements . in the case of our m33 survey , where most of the pne are bright ,",
    "the improvement to our measurements was marginal .",
    "the mean difference between velocities determined via cross - correlation and those found by the line - centroiding ( emsao ) task within rvsao was only @xmath120  .    at this stage",
    ", we verified the internal consistency of our velocity measurements by cross - correlating the spectra of each individual setup against the template spectrum , and intercomparing the results for the 113  pne with multiple measurements .",
    "table  [ tab5 ] summarizes the results of this analysis by listing the mean velocity offset of each setup with respect to the others , and the number of velocity pairs used to derive these values . from the table , it is clear that systematic setup - to - setup velocity differences are minimal : the only setup whose offset is not consistent with zero is that of setup  4 , and its velocities are low by only @xmath121  .",
    "table  [ tab5 ] also lists the standard error between the individual pairs of pn measurements .",
    "this error provides an upper limit to the internal accuracy of our measurements .",
    "column  10 of table  [ tab2 ] lists our velocity measurements for m33 s pne .",
    "column  9 of the table gives the number of fiber setups employed for each object , excluding the observations of january 2003 .",
    "those pne targeted in january are identified in column  13 , and their velocities are the weighted mean of the results from the two observing runs . in total , of the 152  pn candidates identified on our survey frames , 151 were targeted by wiyn , and 140  were detected via their emission lines .",
    "( of the 11 objects that were not detected , 7 are extremely faint . )",
    "note that the errors quoted in column  8 are the internal uncertainties of the cross - correlation technique and do not include any setup - to - setup systematic uncertainty .",
    "as demonstrated in table  [ tab5 ] , such errors are small , @xmath122  .",
    "the large scale velocity distribution of m33 s pne is illustrated in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the most obvious feature displayed in the figure is the galaxy s rotation .",
    "m33 is inclined @xmath123 to the line - of - sight ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , and this inclination",
    "is reflected in the radial velocities of the planetaries .",
    "in fact , since m33 s spheroid - to - disk ratio is extremely small , @xmath124 @xcite , all but @xmath5 pne should be rotating along with the galactic disk .    to explore the dynamics of m33 s pn population , we began by assuming that , in the mean , the system s pne are confined to the disk and move in circular orbits about the galactic nucleus , which is at @xmath125 = 1:33:50.915 , @xmath126 = + 30:39:36.79 @xcite .",
    "we then defined the inclination and orientation of this disk . on average ,",
    "m33 is inclined @xmath127 to the line - of - sight and has a major - axis position angle of @xmath128 @xcite ; these values are consistent with the isophotal contours of the inner parts of the galaxy @xcite , as well as the kinematics of the system s h  ii regions @xcite .",
    "however , such a model is probably too simplistic .",
    "the kinematics of m33 s h  i gas demonstrates the presence of a significant warp in the galaxy s outer regions @xcite .",
    "this warping is also confirmed by the asymmetrical shape of the galaxy s spiral arms @xcite . to include this effect",
    ", we therefore adopted the model of @xcite , in which the inclination and position angle of m33 s disk varies with galactocentric distance .",
    "fortunately , our analysis depends very little on the details of this assumption : over the inner @xmath129 of the galaxy (  over most of our survey region ) , the difference between the @xcite model and the simple @xmath130 @xmath131 geometry is slight ( no more than @xmath132 in inclination and @xmath133 in position angle ) .",
    "nevertheless , since m33 s warp does become important outside this range , and since a few of our pne do have large isophotal radii , we prefer this approach over the less sophisticated flat - disk assumption .    after defining m33 s inclination and position angle",
    ", we deprojected the position of each pn to determine its galactocentric radius ( @xmath81 ) and position angle with respect to the galaxy s major axis ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "the rotation speeds of the pne , @xmath135 , were then inferred from the line - of - sight radial velocities , @xmath136 , via @xmath137 for the systematic velocity , we used @xmath138  ; this value is based on both radio @xcite and optical @xcite observations of the galaxy , and is comfortably close to the mean radial velocity of @xmath139  found from the pne of this study .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig7 ] compares our pn rotational velocities with the rotation curve of m33 s atomic ( h  i ) and molecular ( co ) gas @xcite .",
    "all objects except 14 pne within @xmath140 of the minor axis have been plotted .",
    "overall , the agreement is quite good .",
    "the data display some amount of scatter , but this is due to the peculiar radial , tangential , and vertical velocities of the pne .",
    "when these non - circular motions are amplified by the @xmath141 division , the result is the dispersion seen in the figure . also apparent is the small , but significant , offset between the mean circular velocity of the pne and the rotation speed of the gas .",
    "the bottom panel of the figure shows this offset more clearly by binning the data by galactocentric radius with 18 objects per bin .",
    "the amplitude of the velocity lag , or asymmetric drift , is @xmath6  , less than half the drift velocity observed for old - disk stars in the vicinity of the sun @xcite .",
    "however , since the ratio of m33 s drift speed to rotation velocity is approximately the same as that for the solar neighborhood , our measurement suggests that the dynamical state of m33 s disk is not too dissimilar to that of the milky way .",
    "we will return to the issue of asymmetric drift in section  7 , where we use it to help constrain the shape of the system s velocity ellipsoid .    another way to examine",
    "the motion of m33 s pne is to plot their line - of - sight velocities after removing the contribution of the rotating stellar disk ( defined as the h  i + co gas velocity minus the asymmetric drift ) .",
    "this is done in figure  [ fig8 ] ; the top panel of the figure shows the individual pn velocities , while the lower panel bins the velocities to show the line - of - sight velocity dispersion .",
    "the figure again demonstrates that the non - circular motions of the pne are significant , with @xmath142  .",
    "this is more than twice the @xmath143  dispersion found for the galaxy s h  ii regions @xcite .",
    "in addition , our innermost measurement of @xmath144  is very close to the galaxy s central value of @xmath145  found from absorption line spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "since m33 shows no dynamical evidence for a central black hole or mass concentration , this agreement confirms that we are , indeed , measuring a velocity dispersion that is representative of old disk stars .",
    "figure  [ fig8 ] also supports our contention that there are very few non - disk pne in our sample .",
    "of the 140 pne surveyed , only two objects , pn 67 and pn 24 , have velocities that are more than @xmath146 from the galactic rotation .",
    "these planetaries , which deviate by 2.8 and @xmath147 respectively , may _ possibly _ belong to m33 s spheroidal component . on the other hand , in a normally distributed population of 140 pne",
    ", we should expect to find @xmath5 objects with velocities more than @xmath148 away from the mean .",
    "thus , it is possible that _ none _ of our pne belong to m33 s halo , and all are rotating along with the disk .",
    "this confirms the photometric results of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite that m33 s spheroidal component is negligible compared to its disk .",
    "the most surprising aspect of figure  [ fig8 ] is how little the line - of - sight velocity dispersion depends on galactocentric distance . in the @xmath149-band , where internal extinction presumably is unimportant ,",
    "m33 s disk scale length is @xmath150 @xcite .",
    "our observations , which extend out to a distance of @xmath151 , therefore sample @xmath115  scale lengths of the galaxy .",
    "if m33 s disk is isothermal , then the galaxy s vertical velocity dispersion should decline significantly over this range . specifically ,",
    "if @xmath152 is the scale height of the planetaries and @xmath153 the disk - mass surface density , then under the isothermal disk approximation @xmath154 since m33 s stellar and gas surface density both decline exponentially @xcite , it is reasonable to expect @xmath153 , and therefore @xmath155 , to do the same .",
    "unless the shape of the galaxy s velocity ellipsoid changes dramatically , or m33 s disk is significantly flared , @xmath156 should decrease by more than a factor of 20 over our survey region .",
    "figure  [ fig8 ] clearly demonstrates that it does not .",
    "because the disk of m33 is inclined @xmath123 to the line - of - sight , peculiar stellar motions in the radial ( @xmath157 ) , tangential ( @xmath158 ) , and vertical ( @xmath159 ) directions all contribute to the scatter seen in figure  [ fig8 ] . specifically , the line - of - sight velocity dispersion is related to the galaxy s velocity ellipsoid through @xmath160 consequently , in order to interpret the figure , the shape of m33 s velocity ellipsoid needs to be constrained .    to do this",
    ", we began by using the epicyclic approximation to write @xmath158 in terms of @xmath157 @xmath161 @xcite , where the circular rotation velocity , @xmath162 , is known from the motion of the system s h  i gas .",
    "we then parameterized equation ( 7 ) in terms of the two remaining unknowns , @xmath159 and @xmath157 , and , for each radial bin , we computed the relative probability of observing the given set of pn velocities as a function of these two variables . once these probabilities were established , we normalized their values to one to generate the likelihood of each solution .",
    "note that this type of calculation requires that limits be placed on the variables , so that outside the range of analysis , the probability of a solution is identically zero . for @xmath159 ,",
    "our analysis included all values between @xmath163  ; given the @xmath164  rotation speed of the galaxy , the true value of @xmath159 certainly falls within this range .",
    "our choice of limits for @xmath157 was more difficult . in the vicinity of the sun ,",
    "the ratio of the vertical to radial velocity dispersion for old disk stars is @xmath165 @xcite , and surveys of other spirals consistently find ratios in the range @xmath166 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , almost all these data are for stars between @xmath58 and @xmath5  disk scale lengths from the galactic center : there are no measurements of @xmath157 or @xmath159 over the entire range of radii considered in this paper .",
    "thus , our only guidance on the shape of m33 s velocity ellipsoid comes from numerical simulations .",
    "according to the models of @xcite and @xcite , disk heating by molecular clouds and spiral structure should drive an initially isotropic velocity dispersion towards values of @xmath167 as low as @xmath168 . for a lower limit on @xmath157",
    ", we can therefore demand that @xmath169 . for the upper limit on this quantity",
    ", we can use the requirement that m33 s disk be stable against buckling instabilities , which occur when @xmath170 @xcite . to be slightly conservative , we therefore limited our analysis to @xmath171 .",
    "figure  [ fig9 ] displays the likelihood contours produced by our data . as is obvious from the figure ,",
    "@xmath157 is better constrained than @xmath159 .",
    "this is understandable : not only did our boundary conditions ensure that @xmath169 , but the former variable also receives the contribution of @xmath158 , via the epicyclic approximation . as a result",
    ", the line - of - sight velocity dispersion largely reflects the behavior of @xmath157 ; our limits on @xmath159 come primarily from the constraints placed on the shape of the velocity ellipsoid , and secondarily from the fits .",
    "the more important property shown in figure  [ fig9 ] is the absence of an obvious radial gradient .",
    "there is very little difference between the fits for pne near the center of m33 and pne at @xmath172  disk scale lengths .",
    "if the shape of the galaxy s velocity ellipsoid is roughly constant with radius , then the data imply that @xmath159 must also be very nearly constant . on the other hand , if the vertical velocity dispersion truly declines with radius ( as it must in a constant mass - to - light ratio disk ) ,",
    "the dispersion ratio @xmath167 must also decline .    to make further progress",
    ", we can apply two additional constraints to our data .",
    "the first is the requirement that m33 s disk be stable . according to @xcite , in order for a thin stellar disk to be stable against axisymmetric perturbations , its radial velocity dispersion must satisfy the condition @xmath173 where the epicyclic frequency , @xmath174 , is obtainable from the rotation curve via @xmath175 @xcite .",
    "in addition , for stability against non - axisymmetric perturbations (  bar formation ) , the disk must also satisfy the ( slightly more stringent ) condition @xmath176 @xcite .",
    "if we combine this equation with the isothermal disk approximation given by equation ( 6 ) , we obtain a constraining relationship between the vertical and radial velocity dispersions @xmath177    to use this relation , we need to know @xmath152 , the scale height of pne in m33 s disk .",
    "our probability contours of figure  [ fig9 ] , in combination with the buckling instability condition , allow us to exclude values of @xmath178  pc in m33 s outer regions ( @xmath179  kpc ) . to improve upon this number , however , we must turn to other galaxies . in the milky way ,",
    "measurements of @xmath152 are notoriously uncertain , with published values ranging all the way from 90  pc to 300  pc @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , in other galaxies the situation is worse : internal extinction in the planes of edge - on galaxies make reliable measurements of the pn distribution nearly impossible ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for lack of a better alternative",
    ", we were therefore forced to adopt an intermediate value of @xmath180  pc as the most - likely scale height of our test particles .",
    "this value has two justifications .",
    "first , a milky way scale height of @xmath181  pc implies a vertical pn distribution similar to that of galactic main - sequence f - stars @xcite and a total pn population that is consistent with pn observations in other galaxies @xcite .",
    "second , @xcite have found a correlation between the infrared ( @xmath182 ) central surface brightness of a galaxy and the ratio between the galaxy s vertical and radial scale lengths .",
    "if one applies this relation to m33 @xcite and normalizes the result using the ratio of our galaxy s pn scale height to the total `` old thin disk '' scale height @xcite , then @xmath152 again becomes @xmath183  pc .",
    "obviously , this value carries a substantial uncertainty of at least @xmath184 .",
    "we note that , in theory , the scale height of a galactic disk may change with radius .",
    "if it does , then the effect of the stability criterion will also have a radial dependence . in practice , however , this is not of great concern .",
    "numerous studies of late - type edge - on spirals in the optical and infrared @xcite have found that radial variations in the vertical scale heights of stars are always small , @xmath185 .",
    "this is true even when the galaxies are tidally interacting : a study by @xcite shows that the fractional variation of @xmath152 in disturbed edge - on systems is typically less than 14% .",
    "thus , even if m33 s disk is warped at large radii , our assumption of a constant value for the scale height should be acceptable .",
    "the solid lines of figure  [ fig9 ] show the effect the stability requirement has on our probability contours . in the inner regions of the galaxy ,",
    "the requirement is satisfied almost everywhere : virtually all the solutions lie below the stability cutoff .",
    "however , at large radii , the criterion severely limits the allowable values for the vertical velocity dispersion .",
    "such an effect is unavoidable : if m33 s disk is stable and isothermal , then the vertical velocity dispersion at large distances from the nucleus must be small .",
    "figure  [ fig10 ] applies the stability criterion and marginalizes figure  [ fig9 ] s remaining probability contours over the parameters @xmath157 ( the middle panel ) and @xmath159 ( the lower panel ) .",
    "the top panel of the figure shows the behavior of @xmath159 if one asserts that m33 s stellar disk is at the limit of stability ; this solution also represents the largest values of @xmath159 possible under the isothermal disk approximation . in the figure , we have illustrated the shapes of the non - gaussian errors via the widths of the shaded areas .",
    "the figure contains several features of note .",
    "first , as anticipated , the requirement of stability produces a radial gradient in the vertical velocity dispersion . remarkably , this gradient is much shallower than that expected from a constant mass - to - light ratio disk . in the @xmath10-band ,",
    "m33 s disk scale length is @xmath186 @xcite ; in the infrared , where the effects of extinction gradients are less , the scale length shrinks to @xmath150 @xcite . our kinematic measurements imply a physical scale length for m33 s disk that is @xmath187 or @xmath110  kpc .",
    "this scale length does not change much , even if one requires that the disk be pressing the limits of stability .",
    "the other notable feature of figure  [ fig10 ] is the behavior of the radial component of m33 s velocity ellipsoid . outside of @xmath188  kpc , @xmath157 declines with a scale length that is more than 3 times greater than that of the galaxy s optical light ;",
    "this is slightly larger than the scale length one would expect from the survey data of @xcite , but not exceptionally so .",
    "however , inside of @xmath188  kpc , @xmath157 levels off , and may even decline at small galactocentric radii .",
    "although such behavior is not common , neither is it unique : the line - of - sight velocity dispersions of ngc  3198 and ngc  6503 suggest that these galaxies also have low central values of @xmath157 @xcite .",
    "the turnover of m33 s radial velocity dispersion is most likely a manifestation of the requirement that @xmath157 be much less than the galaxy s rotation speed .",
    "m33 s rotation velocity increases from zero near the galactic center to @xmath189  at @xmath26  kpc .",
    "if @xmath157 did not turn over , it would dominate galactic rotation within @xmath31  kpc of the nucleus , and the result would be a `` hot '' stellar population in the galaxy s central regions .",
    "if such a population exists in m33 , it is extremely weak @xcite .",
    "the turnover of the radial velocity dispersion explains why the system s line - of - sight dispersion is so flat : the increase in @xmath159 near the center of the galaxy is offset by the decline in @xmath157 .",
    "this flattening , however , does not affect the large scale trend in the dispersion ratio . in the interior of the galaxy , @xmath190 ; by @xmath13  kpc , the ratio has dropped to @xmath191 .",
    "this range of values is consistent with the numerical models of disk heating computed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "more importantly , our inferred @xmath167 gradient agrees with the analytic results of @xcite , who showed that the velocity ellipsoid of a disk must become rounder as the stellar velocity dispersion increases .",
    "our recovery of this result supports the validity of our @xmath159-@xmath157 decomposition .",
    "there is one more constraint that can be applied to m33 s stellar kinematics . from the jean s equation ,",
    "the rotational velocity of stars in a stellar disk is related to the circular velocity of the system s gas by @xmath192 where @xmath193 is the stellar density @xcite .",
    "if we use the epicyclic approximation , and assume that m33 s pne are scattered throughout a constant scale height isothermal disk , then this equation for asymmetric drift simplifies to @xmath194 this equation , when combined with a model for the radial dependence of @xmath159 and @xmath157 , places a further constraint on m33 s galactic kinematics .    based on the galaxy s luminosity profile and the data displayed in figure  [ fig10 ] , it is reasonable to parameterize the radial dependence of m33 s vertical velocity dispersion with a simple exponential of scale length @xmath195 .",
    "an exponential function with scale length @xmath196 can also be used to fit the galaxy s radial velocity dispersion , as long as the measurements are restricted to galactocentric distances greater than @xmath188  kpc . inside this radius , however , the exponential law breaks down , and the form of the @xmath157  @xmath81 relation is unknown .    rather than guess the radial dependence of @xmath157 in m33 s inner regions , we elected instead to exclude from the analysis all measurements of @xmath157 and asymmetric drift within 2.5  kpc of the nucleus .",
    "this allowed us to parameterize the radial dependence of both @xmath159 and @xmath157 with exponentials and re - write ( 14 ) as @xmath197 using this equation , we simultaneously solved for the values of @xmath195 , @xmath196 , @xmath198 , and @xmath199 which best fit both the velocity dispersions of figure  [ fig10 ] and the asymmetric drift data of figure  [ fig7 ] . to perform this fit , we minimized the @xmath200-like statistic @xmath201 where @xmath202 is the probability of observing value @xmath203 from a probability distribution @xmath204 , and @xmath205 is the probability of observing the most - likely value .",
    "this statistic , which reduces to the standard @xmath200 value for normally distributed errors , enabled us to consider the non - gaussian uncertainties associated with @xmath157 and @xmath159 , and the asymmetric drift errors in a consistent manner .",
    "it also permitted us to estimate the uncertainties in our scale lengths via a modified jackknife analysis . in this procedure , we repeatedly removed one planetary nebula at random from each of the bins , and re - fit the data . when analyzed in this way ,",
    "the best fit scale length for @xmath155 became @xmath206 ( with 90% of the simulations lying between @xmath207 and @xmath208 ) , and",
    "the most likely value for the scale length of @xmath157 was @xmath209 ( with 90% of the simulations between @xmath210 and @xmath211 ) .",
    "the results do not change much if one forces the disk to marginal stability : under this condition , the derived scale length of @xmath155 declines by less than @xmath212 . once again , these scale lengths are significantly larger than the @xmath213 value found from @xmath149-band photometry .",
    "in fact , our @xmath214 limits on m33 s dynamical scale length lie between @xmath215 and @xmath216 , and none of our 20,000 simulations produced a scale length as low as the galaxy s optical scale length of @xmath217 .",
    "our best fit solution is illustrated in figures  [ fig7]b and [ fig10 ] by dotted lines .",
    "if the disk of m33 is indeed isothermal , then we can substitute the vertical velocity dispersions of figure  [ fig10 ] into equation ( 6 ) to produce estimates for the galaxy s disk mass surface density .",
    "these densities can then be combined with optical @xcite and infrared @xcite surface photometry to generate values for the total disk mass - to - light ratio .",
    "finally , we can remove the contribution of m33 s interstellar medium from the mass - to - light values by subtracting the surface mass density of galactic h  i and h@xmath218 gas @xcite from the total mass density , and applying a first - order correction for internal extinction , using the central extinction value ( @xmath219  mag ) and extinction scale length ( @xmath220 ) derived by @xcite .",
    "these mass estimates and mass - to - light ratios are presented in table  [ tab6 ] .",
    "the errors quoted in table  [ tab6 ] reflect only the formal uncertainties associated with our measurement of @xmath159 ; not included are the systematic errors associated with our adopted value of @xmath152 and the use of the isothermal disk approximation .",
    "the former uncertainty is small : a 25% increase in the pn scale height ( from 175  pc to 220  pc ) results in only a @xmath212 decrease in the derived values for m33 s disk mass surface density and scale length .",
    "the error associated with the isothermal disk approximation is slightly more formidable .",
    "overall , the isothermal approximation provides an adequate fit to the vertical structure of edge - on spirals @xcite and the stellar kinematics of the solar neighborhood @xcite .",
    "however , near the galactic plane , the approximation breaks down : the stellar density distribution is more sharply peaked than the isothermal model would predict @xcite .",
    "this has led @xcite to consider a family of alternative models , which have isothermal ( sech@xmath221 ) and exponential ( @xmath222 ) spatial distributions as their limiting cases . according to these models , m33 s surface mass can be up to 33% larger than that derived using the simple isothermal assumption .",
    "the final systematic uncertainty that is not included in table  [ tab6 ] is one that affects our mass - to - light ratio measurements in m33 s outer regions .",
    "reliable optical and infrared surface photometry exist only for m33 s inner @xmath223 ; outside of this region , one must extrapolate the galaxy s surface brightness from its measured scale length .",
    "the length of this extrapolation is significant , so a small error in scale length propagates into a large error in @xmath224 .",
    "moreover , if m33 s disk is truncated @xcite , or if a small amount of excess luminosity is left over from a tidal interaction , then the derived mass - to - light ratios will be seriously in error .",
    "in fact , the extrapolated @xmath225 color for the outer disk of m33 is not consistent of any population synthesis model @xcite .",
    "given the uncertainties associated with infrared photometry , our anomalously large values for @xmath226 in the outer disk of the galaxy are almost certainly due to errors in the extrapolated @xmath149-band surface photometry .",
    "our value for m33 s disk scale length is more than twice that of the galaxy s infrared light , and 1.5  times that of the galaxy s @xmath10 light .",
    "this discrepancy implies a gradient in the galaxy s disk mass - to - light ratio .",
    "specifically , our observations imply that m33 s disk @xmath224 slowly increases with radius .",
    "part of this increase is due to the growing contribution of m33 s interstellar medium , which has a density distribution that is much flatter than that of the stars @xcite .",
    "however , even when this component is taken into account , a positive gradient the disk mass - to - light ratio remains .",
    "the sign of this gradient runs contrary to expectations : in most models of galaxy formation , it is the inner regions of a galaxy that form first , and contain the older , higher mass - to - light ratio stars @xcite .",
    "moreover , multi - color imaging @xcite and h@xmath17 surface photometry @xcite tend to support this picture : most disks appear to possess significant age gradients that are consistent with the inside - out scenario .",
    "thus , we must consider the possibility that our mass measurements are biased .",
    "in fact , there are several effects which could conceivably introduce a systematic error into our estimates of @xmath159 .",
    "if any of these exist , then our value for the galaxy s kinematic scale length could be in error .",
    "the first possible bias comes from contamination by emission - line objects that are not planetary nebulae . in m33 , h  ii regions and",
    "supernova remnants far outnumber planetary nebulae , and , as population  i objects , their velocity dispersions are significantly less than that of the pne @xcite .",
    "if the fraction of contaminants is higher near the center of m33 than it is at large radii , then a systematic error in the scale length will be the result .",
    "some support for this hypothesis comes from the image quality of the [ o  iii ] @xmath0 frame of m33 s central field : the seeing on that image ( @xmath227 ) is the poorest of any frame in the @xcite survey .",
    "still , for all the reasons detailed in section  2 , contamination is unlikely to be a significant problem in our survey .",
    "all of our pn candidates were detected both in [ o  iii ] @xmath0 and in h@xmath17 , and the excellent seeing on the latter image ( and on the broadband @xmath10 frame ) should have excluded virtually all h  ii regions from our sample . similarly , given the survey s image quality , and the intrinsic ratio of pne to supernovae , it is difficult to envision how the fraction of faint compact supernova remnants could be large enough to cause a systematic error in @xmath195 . at worst , contamination should cause only a slightly underestimate in @xmath159 throughout the galaxy .    a second possible explanation for the large kinematic scale length involves a selection effect .",
    "the inner regions of m33 are quite dusty , with internal extinction values of @xmath228  mag @xcite .",
    "consequently , pn surveys in this area are biased against objects in , and on the far side of the galactic plane . under the isothermal disk approximation ,",
    "this bias is irrelevant , since the velocity dispersion of such a disk is independent of galactic latitude .",
    "however , high above the plane , where the stellar orbits reach turn - around , the approximation must break down .",
    "if most of the pne in our sample are high latitude objects , then it is possible that our pn velocities are not representative of the true kinematic structure of the disk .",
    "since m33 s internal extinction declines rapidly with radius @xcite , the above selection effect has the potential for creating an artificial gradient in @xmath159 .",
    "however , the effect goes in the wrong direction .",
    "if extinction is to produce an overestimate of the disk s kinematic scale length , the pne at high galactic latitude must have a lower dispersion that those near the plane .",
    "yet models developed to fit the luminosity profiles of edge - on galaxies all have vertical velocity dispersions that increase with galactic latitude @xcite .",
    "so while internal extinction may indeed be censoring our data , the effect can not produce the observed discrepancy .",
    "a third way of explaining our large value of @xmath195 involves our basic assumptions about the kinematics of m33 s disk and the stability criteria .",
    "as figure  [ fig9 ] demonstrates , the pn velocities , by themselves , do not fix @xmath159 .",
    "instead , it is the velocity dispersion measurements , in combination with the requirements of dynamic stability , that produce the galaxy s dispersion gradient .",
    "if our warped - disk model for m33 is incorrect , or if the stability criteria have an additional radial dependence , or if the isothermal approximation breaks down at large radii , then an error in the scale length could be the result .",
    "the first of these possibilities can quickly be excluded : in the area covered by our survey , the effects of m33 s warp are minimal .",
    "in fact , if we were to model the galaxy using a simple flat - disk geometry , the derived kinematic scale length of the system would _ increase _ by @xmath229 .",
    "the latter two uncertainties are more difficult to assess .",
    "certainly , the stability criterion given by ( 11 ) is only an approximation , as it assumes spiral - arm pitch angles that are close to zero , and neglects ( among other things ) the thickness of the disk and the existence of gaseous sub - systems .",
    "nevertheless , numerical experiments suggest that the formulation is approximately correct @xcite . similarly , though the limit on @xmath167 from the buckling ( or fire - hose ) instability is not precisely known , the numerical experiments to date all indicate that a dispersion ratio of @xmath230 is reasonable @xcite . finally , though one expects the isothermal approximation to become less accurate at large radii ( due to the longer timescales for stellar interactions ) , surface photometry of edge - on spirals suggests otherwise @xcite .",
    "the final way of creating an artificial gradient in m33 s disk mass - to - light ratio is through the introduction of a radial gradient in the pn scale height .",
    "our measurement of the disk scale length assumes that @xmath152 is constant throughout the galaxy , and , for disks in general , this is a good assumption @xcite .",
    "however , our analysis also assumes that pne belong to the thin disk system and that the pn scale height does not change with radius .",
    "the former assumption is certainly valid .",
    "although deep observations of edge - on galaxies often reveal the existence of red `` thick disk '' envelopes @xcite , the amount of luminosity in this component is small enough so that thick disk pne should be exceedingly rare .",
    "pn surveys of the edge - on spirals ngc  891 @xcite and ngc  4565 @xcite confirm this fact : very few objects are found in the thick disk region .",
    "still , within the thin disk , the scale height of pne could still change .",
    "for example , in the solar neighborhood , the vertical velocity dispersion of a stellar population is roughly proportional to the square root of the population s age @xcite . since",
    "planetary nebulae are derived from a mix of populations with turnoff masses between @xmath231 , their dispersion is a weighted average over the age range which corresponds to these masses ,  from @xmath232  yr to @xmath233  yr . in other words ,",
    "@xmath234 where @xmath235 is the region s star formation rate history , and @xmath236 is the main - sequence turnoff mass of a population with age @xmath76 .",
    "since velocity dispersion is related to scale height via equation ( 6 ) , this means that a gradient in a galaxy s star - formation rate history can produce an artificial gradient in the pn scale height .",
    "figure  [ fig11 ] quantifies this effect for the case where @xmath237 declines exponentially with scale time @xmath238 .",
    "in late - type spirals such as m33 , the evidence suggests that the rate of star formation has been roughly constant over a hubble time @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , then @xmath239 , and the dependence of @xmath159 on @xmath237 is weak . nevertheless , if the star - formation rate history of m33 s inner disk is substantially different from that of its outer disk , a systematic error in our mass determinations may be the result .",
    "unfortunately , the effect shown in figure  [ fig11 ] is much too small to explain m33 s large kinematic scale length : in order to be consistent with a constant @xmath240 disk , the scale height of m33 s pne would have to change by almost an order of magnitude , from @xmath241  pc near the galactic center , to @xmath242  pc at 8  kpc . not only is this many times greater than what can be achieved by changing the galaxy s star formation rate history , but the direction of the effect is wrong .",
    "if the stars of m33 s interior are systematically older than the stars of the outer disk ( as might be expected from an inside - out galaxy formation scenario ) , then our assumption of a constant @xmath152 would produce an overestimate of the surface mass in the inner regions of the galaxy , and an underestimate of surface mass in the outer disk .",
    "this would cause us to underestimate the scale length of the system .",
    "moreover , the discrepancy between the galaxy s photometric and dynamical scale lengths would be exacerbated by the reaction of the system s infrared light to such a gradient .",
    "while the @xmath149-band is far superior to the optical when in comes to viewing stellar luminosity through the veil of interstellar extinction , it is not immune from population effects . just as the ob stars of present day star formation distort surface brightness measurements made in @xmath20 , red supergiants left over from star - formation of the recent past contaminate data taken in @xmath149 .",
    "although photometric enhancements in the infrared are less than those in the optical , they are still substantial @xcite , and if the interior regions of m33 are older than the stars of the outer disk , the galaxy s ir luminosity profile will appear more diffuse that the mass .",
    "this is the opposite of what is seen .",
    "we note that , in principle , the question of m33 s star formation history can be answered via planetary nebula spectrophotometry .",
    "@xcite have shown that the ratio of nitrogen to oxygen in a planetary nebula correlates with its core mass : objects with @xmath243 have n / o @xmath95 , while higher mass objects have @xmath244 .",
    "consequently , this discontinuity , which is most likely caused by dredge - up in agb stars with @xmath245 @xcite , can be used to identify the pne of high mass progenitors .",
    "furthermore , @xcite have shown that one can estimate pn central star masses directly by using deep spectrophotometry to locate the stars on the hr diagram , and then comparing their locations to post - agb evolutionary models .",
    "this technique , when combined with an initial - mass final - mass relation @xcite , can allow us to trace the star - formation history of different parts of m33 s disk , and test for the presence of age gradients in the pn sample .",
    "there have been numerous efforts to probe the radial distribution of m33 s dark halo via the shape of the galaxy s rotation curve @xcite .",
    "however , these efforts have all been limited by the unknown mass - to - light ratio of the galaxy s disk .",
    "the disk - mass estimates of table  [ tab6 ] provide a new constraint on m33 s mass distribution , and help break the disk - halo degeneracy .    to demonstrate this constraint , we began by fitting a smooth @xcite curve to the h  i and co rotation measurements of @xcite .",
    "we then used our mass model to infer a rotation curve of the disk alone .",
    "the radial profile of the dark halo was then estimated by simply differencing the two components .",
    "figure  [ fig12 ] illustrates this disk - halo decomposition .    from the rotation curves of figure  [ fig12 ] and the mass - to - light ratios of table  [ tab6 ] ,",
    "it is clear that there is very little dark matter in m33 s central regions .",
    "based on our pn velocity dispersion measurements , the disk mass - to - light ratios for m33 s central @xmath5  kpc are @xmath246 and @xmath11 .",
    "both these values are close to those predicted for stellar populations dominated by young ( @xmath247  myr old ) stars @xcite .",
    "more importantly , these numbers are statistically identical to those obtained using the galaxy s h  i and co rotation curve , and are also similar to the central mass - to - light ratios derived from the rotation curves of other spirals @xcite .",
    "this consistency implies that the constant mass - to - light approach of `` maximal disk '' models is tenable , at least in the inner regions of galaxies .    outside of @xmath5  kpc , m33 s disk",
    "mass - to - light ratio exhibits a small , but distinct gradient , going from @xmath11 at @xmath5  kpc to @xmath248 at @xmath249  kpc .",
    "since this appears to be in conflict with the inside - out model of galaxy formation , one possible explanation is the presence of dark matter associated with m33 s disk .",
    "indeed , m33 s disk - mass alone produces a rotation curve that is more - or - less flat with radius .",
    "another explanation is the increasing importance of m33 s gaseous disk . the surface density of m33 s gas declines more slowly than that of galaxy s optical light @xcite .",
    "consequently , at large radii , this component can be expected to dominate the disk s mass budget . however , as summarized in table  6 , the radius where this occurs lies significantly outside the region of our survey . even in our outermost bin ,",
    "m33 s interstellar medium comprises only @xmath184 of the disk mass .    one final explanation for the behavior of m33 s disk mass - to - light ratio lies in the vigorous star formation occurring in m33 s inner regions .",
    "it is entirely possible that , near the center of the galaxy , the mass contributed by the region s older , higher mass - to - light ratio populations is being overwhelmed by the luminosity of present - day stars .",
    "evidence for this possibility comes from the results of @xcite and @xcite , who demonstrate that star formation rate of m33 s disk has a steeper radial dependence than the galaxy s @xmath10-light .",
    "whatever the reason for m33 s increasing disk mass - to - light ratio , the fact that the galaxy s disk mass - to - light ratios are consistent with those expected from young stellar populations strongly suggests that dark matter is not an important constituent of the disk .",
    "models , such as the molecular gas hypothesis of @xcite , are certainly ruled out .",
    "our analysis is based on the velocities of only 140  pne , so the spatial resolution of our measurements is poor .",
    "however , if we assume that m33 s disk has an exponential profile , and that our surface mass densities are accurate , then we can use our disk / halo decomposition to place limits on the radial profile of the galaxy s dark matter . according to cold dark matter models of galaxy formation",
    ", systems such as m33 should contain `` cusps '' of dark matter at their center , with power - law density profiles in the range @xmath250 , where @xmath251 @xcite . as is illustrated in the lower panel of figure  [ fig12 ] , our central slope is much shallower than this , with @xmath252 .",
    "this result is robust : if we alter the pn scale height by 50% , or change the disk scale length by 25% , or increase the total disk mass 33% ( either by adopting an exponential law for the disk s vertical profile , or by changing the central value of @xmath159 ) , the slope of m33 s dark matter core remains low .",
    "the result also agrees with the conclusions of @xcite , who ruled out the presence of a steep dark matter core in m33 on the basis of the galaxy s rotation curve , and the assumption of a constant ( @xmath149-band ) mass - to - light ratio disk .",
    "our analysis removes the latter assumption , but is otherwise similar .",
    "if our analysis is correct , then m33 is another example of a galaxy whose interior dark matter profile is flat .",
    "high resolution rotation curves now exist for a large number of low - luminosity and low - surface brightness spirals and dwarfs , and every one is consistent with a value of @xmath253 @xcite .",
    "it is still unclear whether this shallow a slope is a critical problem for the cold dark matter paradigm @xcite , or whether the discrepancy can be explained by the limitations in the measurements or the models @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , m33 appears to be another example this problem .    outside of @xmath58  kpc",
    ", our analysis suggests that m33 s dark matter halo obeys the inverse - square law density dependence that is expected from isothermal and @xcite distributions .",
    "because the dynamical scale length of the disk is larger than the photometric scale length , the system s total disk mass is larger than that expected from the maximal disk hypothesis . within a radius of 10  kpc , our velocity dispersion measurements yield a disk mass @xmath254",
    "this is @xmath188  times larger than one would obtain using @xmath10-band surface photometry and the maximum disk hypothesis , and @xmath115  times larger than one would derive from a similar analysis in @xmath149 .",
    "still , within this radius , m33 s disk contains only @xmath255 of the total mass of the galaxy .",
    "of course , m33 s disk does not end at 10  kpc .",
    "although our planetary nebula detections end near this 10  kpc limit , observations of m33 s h  i gas extend to nearly twice that distance @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of the extended h  i data is made slightly more difficult by the increasing importance of the galactic warp at large radii .",
    "nevertheless , if the models of @xcite and @xcite are accurate , then m33 s rotational velocity increases from @xmath256  to @xmath257  between 10  kpc and 20  kpc .",
    "this suggests that the bulk of m33 s dark matter halo still resides outside the region of our survey .",
    "until now , our knowledge of the stellar kinematics of spiral galaxies has come principally from observations of stars in the solar neighborhood , and secondarily from absorption - line measurements in the inner regions of face - on and edge - on spirals .",
    "our planetary nebula observations have improved upon this situation . for the first time",
    ", we have been able to measure the shape of the stellar velocity ellipsoid throughout a galactic disk , and directly measure the variation in a galaxy s disk mass surface density .",
    "our data suggest that , in the inner regions of galaxies , maximal disk models for the rotation curve are appropriate , and the contribution of dark matter is negligible .",
    "however , the data also show that the mass - to - light ratios of galactic disks do change with radius , and the @xmath224 of the inner disk may be a factor of @xmath172 smaller than that of the outer disk .",
    "still , the existence of this gradient does not change the fact that most of a galaxy s material lies well away from the disk in a dark halo that roughly follows an inverse square density law .",
    "models in which the dark matter is in the form of molecular gas are excluded by our observations .",
    "we would like to thank e. corbelli for providing m33 s rotation curve in digital form , d. willmarth for assisting in the setup for our pn spectroscopy , and r. chandar for providing additional pn spectra for our analysis .",

    "<S> we use our sample of 152  pne to show that the bright end of the galaxy s [ o  iii ] @xmath0 planetary nebula luminosity function ( pnlf ) has the same sharp cutoff seen in other galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the apparent magnitude of this cutoff , along with the dirbe / iras foreground extinction estimate of @xmath1 , implies a distance modulus for the galaxy of @xmath2 ( @xmath3  mpc ) . </S>",
    "<S> although this value is @xmath4 larger than the galaxy s cepheid distance , the discrepancy likely arises from differing assumptions about the system s internal extinction . </S>",
    "<S> our photometry , which extends more than 3  mag down the pnlf , also reveals that the faint - end of m33 s pn luminosity function is non - monotonic , with an inflection point @xmath5  mag below the pnlf s bright limit . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that this feature is due to the galaxy s large population of high core - mass planetaries , and that its amplitude may eventually be a useful diagnostic for studies of stellar populations .    </S>",
    "<S> fiber - coupled spectroscopy of 140 of the pn candidates confirms that m33 s pn population rotates along with the old disk , with a small asymmetric drift of @xmath6  . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the population s line - of - sight velocity dispersion varies little over @xmath7  optical disk scale lengths , with @xmath8  . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this is due to a combination of factors , including a decline in the radial component of the velocity ellipsoid at small galactocentric radii , and a gradient in the ratio of the vertical to radial velocity dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> we use our data to derive the dynamical scale length of m33 s disk , and the disk s mass - to - light ratio . </S>",
    "<S> our most likely solution suggests that the surface mass density of m33 s disk decreases exponentially , but with a scale length that is @xmath9 times larger than that of the system s ir luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> the large scale length also implies that the disk s @xmath10-band mass - to - light ratio changes from @xmath11 in the galaxy s inner regions to @xmath12 at @xmath13  kpc . </S>",
    "<S> models in which the dark matter is distributed in the plane of the galaxy are excluded by our data . </S>"
