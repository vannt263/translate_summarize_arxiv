    "@xcite and @xcite found a gaussian distribution for the difference between the flare and cme onsets . according to @xcite",
    "the mean difference is 7 min . in these studies ,",
    "linear back extrapolation of the cme height time curve was used to estimate the cme start time .",
    "however , the cme onset times can not be accurately determined by using only coronagraphic observations which miss the early phase of the cme acceleration and propagation due to the occulter disk .",
    "the cme kinematics typically shows three phases of evolution @xcite . in the initiation phase , the cme rises with velocities of several tens of km  s@xmath4 , followed by an impulsive acceleration .",
    "thereafter , the cme propagates with almost constant or slowly decreasing / increasing velocity depending on its interaction with the ambient solar wind ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "recent case studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) combined euv images with coronagraphic observations to derive detailed cme acceleration profiles from the cme initiation close to the solar surface until its propagation beyond 15  @xmath5 . in these events",
    "the cme acceleration profiles showed a good synchronization with the energy release in the associated flare , as evidenced in the hxr flux or sxr derivative .",
    "@xcite studied a set of 22 cme events associated with flares using soho eit , mlso mark iv , lasco c2 and c3 .",

    "the high time cadence and the overlapping field of views ( fov ) of the different stereo instruments enabled us to derive detailed and continuous cme height- , velocity- and acceleration - time profiles from the low corona up to about 15  r@xmath7 .",
    "out of the 95 cmes presented in @xcite , 70 events could be associated with a goes ( geostationary operational environmental satellite ) flare and 24 events with a filament eruption .",
    "9 events are associated with both , a flare and a filament . in the present paper , we perform a statistical study on the relation between characteristic cme and flare parameters as well as on the temporal relationship between the two phenomena .",
    "we also study the characteristic cme parameters separately for events with / without associated flares and with / without associated filament eruptions .",
    "the cme kinematics was derived from data of the stereo / secchi instrument suite @xcite .",

    "the secchi package consists of an extreme ultraviolet imager ( euvi ) , two coronagraphs ( cor1 and cor2 ) and two heliospheric imagers ( hi1 and hi2 ) . for our study of the cme kinematics we combined data from euvi , cor1 and cor2 .",
    "euvi provides observations from the solar chromosphere and low corona in four different wavelengths with a fov up to 1.7  @xmath5 @xcite . for our study",
    "we used primarily 171    observations with a time cadence as high as 75 sec . in some cases it was only possible to track the cme in 195    observations with a default cadence of 10 min but in some cases as good as 2.5 min",
    "the high time cadence was necessary to derive detailed acceleration profiles of the cme initation and impulsive acceleration phase .",
    "observations in 171    and 195    were compared to 304    filtergrams to check if a filament eruption and/or flare was observed in association with the cme under study .",

    "the acceleration phase duration @xmath10 was defined as the time difference between @xmath14 , the time when the acceleration profile has decreased to 10% of its maximum value , and @xmath15 , the time in the increasing phase of the acceleration when the profile has reached 10% of its maximum value .",
    "@xmath11 , the first measured height in our height - time plots , is used as a rough estimate of the cme intiation height , because we measured the cmes as soon as it was possible to observe them in the low corona .",

    "figures [ histvmax][histha ] show the distributions of the different cme parameters for the whole sample of 95 events ( grey histograms ) together with the distribution for events associated with flares ( colored histogram in the top panel ) and for events associated with filament eruptions ( colored histogram in the bottom panel ) . for each parameter we derived the arithmetic mean together with its standard deviation and the median and its absolute deviation , for the whole sample as well as separately for the samples with / without associated flares or filaments .",
    "the resulting values are summarized in table [ tab : tablesubgroups ] .",
    "because the distributions do not show a gaussian behaviour but have a tail towards high values , a lognormal distribution better describes their behaviour @xcite .",
    "thus we also calculated the mean value @xmath16 and the standard deviation @xmath17 of the natural logarithm of the different cme parameter distributions @xcite : @xmath18 @xmath19 with e the mean value and var the variance of the quantity . in the following we use @xmath20 and @xmath21 as the median and multiplicative standard deviation of the lognormal probability function of the distribution @xcite .",
    "the confidence interval of 68.3% is given by @xmath22 ; @xmath16 and @xmath17 are also summarized for each cme parameter in table [ tab : tablesubgroups ] .    to check if the cme distributions with / without associated flares and with / without associated filament eruptions , respectively , come from the same continuous distribution ( null hypothesis ) we used the kolmogorov - smirnov test ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "based on a sample of 95 cme events we present a statistical study on various characteristic cme parameters and their relation to flares .",

    "the ratio between the median values of the lognormal probability functions of both subgroups is about a factor of 2 . only for @xmath8",

    "but there exist also cmes associated with filament eruptions , which have high @xmath8 and @xmath9 values and low @xmath10 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath11 .",
    "for example the highest measured @xmath9 value for a cme which was associated with an erupting filament was 1561  m  s@xmath35 , the smallest value for a cme event with no erupting filament was 35  m  s@xmath35 ( the second lowest value of the whole distribution ) . both of these events were not associated with a flare .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov test did not show a clear distinction between both subgroups .",
    "only for @xmath9 the test suggested that both distributions do not come from the same population at a 0.05 level of significance .",
    "the correlations obtained between @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 with the goes peak flux @xmath50 and the sxr rise time @xmath51 of the associated flare were low .",
    "we found a weak positive correlation between the cme acceleration duration @xmath10 and the flare rise time @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) and a weak negative correlation between @xmath9 and @xmath51 ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "correlations between @xmath8 and @xmath9 with @xmath50 were @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively .",
    "if the events are averaged and binned into the different goes classes , the correlations are much more distinct .",
    "the mean values in each goes class show an increasing trend for @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and a decreasing trend for @xmath10 with higher goes flux .    for the majority of the events ( 75% ) we found that the cme acceleration starts _ before _ the sxr flare onset , which is consistent with the findings of @xcite , suggesting that the flare is a consequence of the eruption .",
    "similar to our study these authors also found about one fourth of the events , for which the onset of the associated flare occurred before the cme acceleration started .",
    "they explained these cases by a superposition of two flares , a confined flare in the pre - eruption stage , which releases only a part of the stored magnetic energy , and a second flare , beginning after the cme acceleration onset and causing a prolongation of the first flare in the full - disk integrated sxr light curve .",
    "the cme is associated with the second flare but because of the superposition , the flare start is measured from the first one . to test this hypothesis",
    ", we checked the sxr curves for all events , for which the cme acceleration start was after the flare onset and found indeed in 11 out of 14 events evidence of a second sxr peak , confirming their suggestion .",
    "figure [ accsxr ] shows two representative examples .",
    "the top panels show the cme acceleration profile , the bottom panels the goes sxr flux together with its derivative .",
    "we marked the two possible sxr peaks by arrows . assuming that we have a superposition of two subsequent flares",
    ", we would also measure erroneous sxr start times and as a result too long @xmath51 .",
    "this misidentification would also influence our correlation negatively . to test this , we correlated @xmath51 again with @xmath9 and @xmath10 considering only events for which the cme acceleration starts before the flare onset and found indeed distinctly higher correlation coefficients ( figure [ risetime1 ] , @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) than for the whole sample ( shown in figure [ risetime ] , @xmath58=0.37@xmath10.15 and @xmath53 ) .",
    "thus superposition of two subsequent flares and more complex structures are probably a reason for the weak correlations and may account for a considerable number of events , where the flare seems to start before the eruption .    for the majority of the events ( 77% ) we found that the end of the cme acceleration occurred _",
    "after _ the sxr peak .",
    "especially long duration flares reach a certain point , when they become too weak to compensate cooling of the hot plasma . as a result",
    "the sxr curve decreases although the energy release in the flare may still be going on .    for 81% of the events",
    "the time delay between the cme acceleration peak and the peak of the goes sxr flux derivative , which is a proxy for the flare energy release rate , was smaller than @xmath110 min , for 58% smaller than @xmath15 min .",
    "this high synchronization hints at a feed - back relationship between the cme and the flare energy release @xcite .",
    "there are basically two forces acting on a flux rope in equilibrium , an upward directed magnetic pressure and a downward directed magnetic tension of the overlying magnetic field .",
    "when the magnetic structure looses equilibrium , it starts rising and a current sheet is formed below it , where magnetic reconnection takes place @xcite .",
    "the reconnection reduces the tension of the overlying field and enhances the magnetic pressure at the bottom part of the flux rope due to additional poloidal flux , providing the upward acceleration of the rope @xcite . the upward motion of the rope leads to elongation of the current sheet and a more efficient reconnection , thus enhancing the acceleration .",
    "on the other hand , more efficient reconnection means also a more powerful energy release in the cme - associated flare , which directly relates the dynamics of the eruption and the energy release in the flare .         for the whole sample of 95 events ( grey distributions in the top and bottom panels ) . in the top panel the @xmath8 distribution of cme events associated with a flare",
