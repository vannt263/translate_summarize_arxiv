    "<S> our analysis shows that the tridimensional conformations of long filaments may depend critically on the young s modulus frequence in case of resonance with other natural frequencies of the filament . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , far from resonance the shape of the solutions remain very close to that of the homogeneous case . in the case of biomolecules </S>",
    "<S> , it is well known that various other elements , besides sequence - dependent effects , combine to determine their conformation , like self - contact , salt concentration , thermal fluctuations , anisotropy and interaction with proteins . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that sequence - dependent effects alone may have a significant influence on the shape of these molecules , including dna . </S>",

    "<S> , 87.15.la    the study of tridimensional structures of filamentary objects is of great interest in several areas of knowledge , ranging from microscopic to macroscopic systems . examples of macroscopic systems in engineering are the stability of suboceanic cables  @xcite and installation of optical fibers  @xcite ; in biology , the shape of climbing plants  @xcite ; and , in physics and mathematics , the shape and dynamics of cracking whips  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the microscopic examples are in the area of the structural biology , as in the study of the structure of biomolecules  @xcite and bacterial fibers  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> filamentary systems are usually modeled as thin _ uniform </S>",
    "<S> _ rods . </S>",
    "<S> however , nonuniformities in the filament properties can affect significantly its tridimensional structure , so in this work we study certain resonant variations in the shape of helical rods induced by periodic variations in the stiffness of the rod . </S>",
    "<S> one of the motivations for this theoretical study is , on one hand , the observation that the dna stiffness is sequence - dependent  @xcite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> it is also known  @xcite that a substantial fraction of all eukaryotic genomes are composed of tandemly repeated sequences of base - pairs . </S>",
    "<S> these repetitive dnas are formed by nucleotide sequences of varying length and composition reaching up to 100 megabasepairs of length  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> usually they are regarded as `` selfish '' or `` junk '' dna  @xcite because they seem to have little or no functional role . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , some studies suggest that the behavior of repetitive sequences can be , in some cases , beneficial to the organism and , in others , harmful @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it could also be related to some form of cancer @xcite .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we consider rods with small periodic variation of the young s modulus , motivated by the existence of a large number of repetitive sequences of dna . </S>",
    "<S> so the numerical calculations presented here have been performed using dna parameters . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the qualitative results remain valid for general rods with periodic stiffness variation . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that ideal elastic rod models are not considered to give realistic solutions for the spatial structure of the dna or other biomolecules  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our results for the tridimensional configurations must be considered as general mechanical tendencies due to sequence - dependent variations of the young s modulus , rather than exact solutions for the dna structure . </S>",
    "<S> realistic models for the dna consider base - pair parameters , as the recent theory of sequence - dependent dna elasticity proposed by coleman , olson and swigon  @xcite , where the elastic energy depends on a function of the six kinematical variables relating the relative orientation and displacement between successive base - pairs . </S>",
    "<S> thermal fluctuations play also an important role in the structure of these molecules and , therefore , statistical mechanical approaches are more appropriate to model their spatial configurations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , in order to analyse the effect of periodic nonhomogeneities in equilibrium configurations , it is sufficient to take into account thermal fluctuations just roughly . </S>",
    "<S> this has been done by adopting an excess of 5% of linking number  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a table with the young s modulus of all 32 trinucleotide units was recently obtained in  @xcite that can be used as a reference for the amplitude of the variation . </S>",
    "<S> we analyse the effects of the frequency of these periodic modulations in the young s modulus , in terms of dynamical stroboscopic maps and directly in the tridimensional structure of the rod . </S>",
    "<S> we are particularly interested in understanding how the sequence - dependent mechanical properties of the filament can cause its shape to deviate from the well known uniform solution , namely , the helix .    </S>",
    "<S> mielke and holmes  @xcite demonstrated that the variation of the bending stiffness along the rod can cause spatially complex tridimensional shapes and sensitivity with respect to initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> they described _ infinitely _ long rods as initial value problems ( ivp ) and used analytical techniques based on dynamical systems theory to study some specific hyperbolic fixed points related to homoclinic orbits .    </S>",
    "<S> it should be stressed that here we analyze a case where it is not possible to use the perturbative methods of dynamical systems theory , therefore we had to resort to numerical simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> the kirchhoff rod model has been extensively used in the literature to model continuous rods  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , shi and hearst  @xcite and nizette and goriely  @xcite obtained and classified , respectively , all the solutions of the static kirchhoff equations for homogeneous rods with circular cross section . </S>",
    "<S> coleman _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite made a complete analysis of the stability of dna within the framework of the kirchhoff rod model , subjected to strong anchoring end conditions . </S>",
    "<S> recently , da fonseca and de aguiar  @xcite compared homogeneous and nonhomogeneous rods , with varying stiffness , subjected to boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of nonhomogeneous mass distribution in the dynamics of unstable closed rods have been analyzed by fonseca and de aguiar  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> yang _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _  @xcite have studied a particular case of nonhomogeneous young s modulus for closed rods . manning _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite have incorporated into the kirchhoff model the sequence - dependent discrete data of the intrinsic curvature of dna . in the present study </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the dna is intrinsically an untwisted straight rod , but we include sequence - dependent stiffness .    in the kirchhoff model for an inextensible rod the young s modulus appears in the equations through its _ bending _ coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> as there is no table with the _ bending _ coefficients for all _ di _ or _ trinucleotides _ , we shall consider the data in @xcite as a reference for our calculations , as mentioned .    </S>",
    "<S> we shall consider the hamiltonian formulation of the kirchhoff s equations . </S>",
    "<S> we shall follow the simplest derivation by nizette and goriely  @xcite instead of the rigorous hamiltonian formulation by mielke and holmes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reader is referred to  @xcite for a derivation of the kirchhoff model , and to ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for the hamiltonian formulation . </S>",
    "<S> hamilton s equations for the kirchhoff model are analogous to those of a symmetric spinning top in a gravity field , with the arc length @xmath0 along the rod playing the role of time . </S>",
    "<S> the main advantage of a hamiltonian formulation is that the theory of chaotic hamiltonian systems and stroboscopic maps can be directly applied to understand the spatial behavior of the filament . </S>",
    "<S> the length of the tandemly repeated sequences can reach up to 100 megabasepairs @xcite while the length of the repeats is no more than a few hundreds of basepairs long . </S>",
    "<S> so we shall solve the kirchhoff s equations as an initial value problem ( ivp ) to find the conformational solutions of the filament problem .    </S>",

    "<S> fig  [ fig1 ] displays nine stroboscopic maps on the @xmath67 plane for different values of frequency @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> we start with @xmath68 ( fig  [ fig1]a ) where a larger stability island encloses the main equilibrium point at @xmath69rad and @xmath70 , and a smaller island is seen on the left , at @xmath71rad . </S>",

    "<S> the main result of this numerical experiment is that the tridimensional conformations of long filaments may depend critically on sequence - dependent properties if these are in resonance with other natural periods of the filament . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , in the limit of very low or very high frequencies , as compared to @xmath82 , the shape of the solutions remain very close to that of the homogeneous case . in the case of biomolecules </S>",
