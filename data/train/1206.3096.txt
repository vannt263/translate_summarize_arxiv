    "we are interested in a potential invisible decay width of the higgs boson .",
    "the total decay width of the sm higgs is about @xmath14mev for a higgs mass of 125 gev @xcite .",
    "this is below the resolution of the lhc and can thus not be directly measured in the resonance channels @xmath10 and @xmath12 , where the final state can be reconstructed . a discrepancy from the theoretical value for",

    "e.g. _ @xmath15 where @xmath16 depends on the production mechanism and @xmath17 is the luminosity .",
    "thus , via the branching ratio the total width enters indirectly in the event rate . if we take a given model , for example the sm , and extend it by adding a hypothetical invisible decay width to the higgs boson as a free parameter @xmath18 , we can perform a fit of @xmath19 to the observed event rates , assuming the higgs mass and the sm higgs production mechanisms .",
    "two such global fits have recently been performed in @xmath20 ref .",
    "@xcite and @xmath21 ref .",
    "@xcite , resulting in the upper bounds @xmath22 at 68% ( 95% ) cl ( see also @xcite ) . as the statistics are not sufficient to claim the higgs boson discovery , these constraints should be interpreted with caution .",
    "nevertheless , one may already explore implications of these results for new physics .",
    "for example , the bounds on the invisible higgs decay set rather strict constraints on higgs  portal dark matter models @xcite where @xmath23 can be as large as 80% or more @xcite",
    ". early work on invisible higgs decays in minimal extensions of the sm also employed other higgs production mechnaisms : @xmath24 higgs strahlung @xcite , associated @xmath25 or @xmath26 production @xcite,@xcite , and in ref .",

    "( further constraints are imposed if the neutralino is assumed to be thermal dark matter @xcite ) .    to make our analysis more transparent",

    "values above 40% are disfavored by the lhc higgs signal which allows us to place constraints on @xmath71 and @xmath53 .",
    "these constraints are the strongest for @xmath100 and low @xmath34 , covering the @xmath53 values in the kinematically allowed range for @xmath98 up to 80 gev , and values of @xmath71 up to 200 gev .",
    "it is clear that the constraints will get significantly stronger when the experimental limit on @xmath96 reaches a 10% level .",
    "for example , most of the parameter region shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ( left ) would be excluded .",
    "the massless neutralino scenario would also be strongly constrained since the typical @xmath96 is around 10 - 20% in this case .",
    "further bounds on invisible higgs decay can come from monojet analyses ( see e.g. @xcite ) , although their impact is expected to be less significant .",
    "the tentative higgs signal reported by the lhc collaborations appears to agree well with the sm expectations . in this paper , we have studied implications of this observation for the neutralino sector of susy models . the sm  like higgs can decay into a pair of the lightest neutralinos with the branching ratio up to 75% . as invisible higgs decay",
    "is constrained by the existing data , we find that most of the parameter region @xmath80 gev , @xmath1 gev at @xmath48 and @xmath3 gev , @xmath1 gev at @xmath101 is disfavored .",
    "this conclusion depends only weakly on the other susy parameters . in particular",
    ", the current bounds on superpartners suggest that the sfermion / gluino masses are in the tev range .",
    "it is therefore a good approximation to assume that the lightest mssm higgs is very similar to the sm higgs .",

    "this allows us to set constraints on the higgs ",
    "neutralino coupling , which is controlled mostly by @xmath71 and @xmath53 .",
    "it is important to note that these constraints are `` direct '' in the sense that they do not rely on further assumptions such as gaugino mass unification or specific susy decay chains , unlike many previous analyses @xcite",
