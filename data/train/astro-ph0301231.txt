    "hard x - ray surveys provide the most direct probe of supermassive black hole ( smbh ) accretion activity , since high energy x - rays can penetrate extremely large column densities of gas and dust .",
    "early analyses of deep _ chandra _ x - ray surveys found that optical selections of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) had missed large numbers of accreting smbhs .",
    "barger et al .  ( 2001b ) showed that the redshift history of smbh growth is more strongly peaked to low redshifts than had been inferred from optically - selected samples .    with the high spatial resolution and energy sensitivity of deep _ chandra _ observations ,",
    "x - ray samples can be selected at both low and high redshifts in the same rest - frame _ hard _ energy band and their optical counterparts , and hence spectroscopic redshifts ( @xmath7% can be identified ) , unambiguously determined .",
    "the hardest band for which the hard x - ray luminosity function ( hxlf ) can presently be determined over a wide range of redshifts is rest - frame @xmath1  kev .",
    "although some compton - thick sources may still be omitted , the accounting will be far more complete than that of any other available sample .",
    "in this paper we use the 1  ms exposure of the _ chandra _ deep field north ( cdf - n ) and three @xmath8  ks exposures of the a370 , ssa13 , and ssa22 fields , together with previous _",
    "rosat _ and _ asca _ data , to construct the rest - frame @xmath1  kev luminosity function from @xmath9 to 4 and model the smbh accretion history .",
    "we assume @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12  km  s@xmath4  mpc@xmath4 .",
    "we use @xmath13 to denote the rest - frame @xmath1  kev luminosity .",
    "the faintest data are taken from the 1  ms cdf - n catalogs of brandt et al .",
    "( 2001 ; hereafter b01 ) and barger et al .",
    "we exclude known stars and the small number of extended x - ray sources .",
    "the flux limits are @xmath14  ergs  @xmath15  s@xmath4 ( @xmath0  kev ) and @xmath16  ergs  @xmath15  s@xmath4 ( @xmath1  kev ) . below a flux of @xmath17  ergs  @xmath15  s@xmath4 ( @xmath1  kev ) and @xmath18  ergs  @xmath15  s@xmath4 ( @xmath0  kev )",
    "we include only sources lying within @xmath19 of the aimpoint where the redshift identifications are most complete ; above these fluxes we include all the sources .",
    "this restricted sample contains 199 ( 52% ) sources in the @xmath1  kev band and 219 ( 57% ) in the @xmath0  kev band , where the parentheses are the percentages with redshifts .",
    "we supplement the sample at fluxes above @xmath20  ergs  @xmath15  s@xmath4 ( @xmath1  kev ) and @xmath21  ergs  @xmath15  s@xmath4 ( @xmath0  kev ) with data from the ssa13 field ( barger et al .",
    "2001a ) , the a370 field ( barger et al .",
    "2001b ) , and the ssa22 field ( a. j. barger et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "this adds a further 67 ( 72% ) sources in the @xmath1  kev band and 88 ( 60% ) in the @xmath0  kev band .",
    "we further supplement the sample with the larger area bright flux samples in the soft band from _ rosat _ ( lehmann et al .",
    "2001 ) and the hard band from _ asca _ ( akiyama et al .",
    "these have highly complete spectroscopic identifications .",
    "for the conversion of counts to flux in the cdf - n , we use the x - ray spectral photon indices @xmath22 determined in b01 from the hard - band to soft - band counts ratios . for the conversions in the remaining _ chandra _ fields ,",
    "we assume a fixed @xmath23 , which is approximately the average @xmath22 in the b01 sample . for the flux conversions in the _ rosat _ and _ asca _ samples",
    ", we use the softer @xmath22 values assumed by lehmann et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and akiyama et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , which are appropriate for higher flux sources .",
    "we determined the solid angle covered by the sample at a given flux by comparing the observed numbers of objects as a function of flux with the measured number counts in the appropriate energy band . for @xmath1",
    "kev we use the averaged counts given in cowie et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and for @xmath0  kev we use the power - law fits of mushotzky et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , which agree with other determinations ( e.g. , b01 ; rosati et al .",
    "the solid angle covered by the combined @xmath1  kev samples ranges from just under 0.01  deg@xmath24 at the faintest fluxes to 5.8  deg@xmath24 at the highest fluxes . at @xmath25  ergs  @xmath15  s@xmath4 ( @xmath1  kev ) the solid angle is 0.11  deg@xmath24 .",

    "sources with broad - line optical / uv spectra are denoted by a second , larger symbol .",
    "any source more luminous than @xmath3  ergs  s@xmath4 is very likely an agn on energetic grounds ( zezas , georgantopoulos , & ward 1998 ; moran et al .",
    "1999 ) , though many of the intermediate luminosity sources do not show obvious agn signatures in the optical .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that the highest x - ray luminosity sources are mostly broad - line agn .",
    "in the present section we concentrate on two redshift intervals : @xmath2 , as shown by the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b , and @xmath27 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a . with these redshift intervals",
    "we can compare samples chosen in approximately the same rest - frame hard x - ray energy range of @xmath28  kev ( the observed @xmath1  kev band at the center of the low redshift interval ) and @xmath1  kev ( the observed @xmath0  kev band at the center of the high redshift interval ) .",
    "the remaining small differential @xmath29-corrections to rest - frame @xmath1  kev are made by assuming that the spectra can be approximated by @xmath30 power - laws .",
    "we have chosen to use this spectral index since the differential k correction is mostly significant in correcting from higher to lower energies where the spectra may be better represented by the unabsorbed intrinsic power law ( see barger et al .  2002 ) . however , the results are only weakly sensitive to this assumption . for a @xmath23 power - law k - correction",
    "the hxlf at @xmath27 is essentially unchanged while the hxlfs at @xmath2 shifts to slightly lower luminosities ( a factor of 1.27 ) while the shape remains approximately the same .",
    "we have chosen not to correct for the intrinsic absorption since this too requires an assumption about the intrinsic spectrum and also about the form of the absorption and any scattering .",
    "since we are comparing in the same rest frame at different redshifts this will not affect the hxlf comparison unless there is substantial evolution in the intrinsic absorption .",
    "moreover in the @xmath1  kev rest frame band the average absorption corrections are not very large .",
    "if we assume an intrinsic spectral index of @xmath30 and a simple photoelectric absorption the average absorption correction to @xmath13 is 1.14 in the @xmath31 redshift range and 1.53 in the @xmath27 range .",
    "we probe to an @xmath13 below @xmath32  ergs  s@xmath4 in the high redshift interval and below @xmath3  ergs  s@xmath4 in the low redshift interval .",
    "both samples are highly complete in redshift identifications at high luminosities . at @xmath33",
    "ergs  s@xmath4 in the high redshift interval there are 22 spectroscopically identified sources , 21 of which are broad - line agn . at most there are a further 18 spectroscopically unidentified sources that could lie at these luminosities in this redshift interval ; however , a substantial fraction of these are likely at other redshifts . at @xmath33",
    "ergs  s@xmath4 in the low redshift interval , 85% of the identified sources are broad - line agn , and there are only three unidentified sources that could lie at these luminosities in this redshift interval .",
    "thus , most of the high luminosity x - ray sources are broad - line agn rather than obscured agn .",
    "the differential hxlf as a function of x - ray luminosity and redshift , @xmath34 , is the number of x - ray sources per unit comoving volume per unit logarithmic luminosity .",
    "we adopt the @xmath35 method to estimate the binned hxlf in different redshift shells as @xmath36 where the @xmath37 is the total comoving volume in the redshift bin @xmath38 in which source @xmath39 with luminosity @xmath13 could lie and still be included in the sample and the summation is over all sources in the given redshift interval and luminosity bin .",
    "( log denotes the base 10 logarithm . )    our measured hxlfs for the two redshift intervals",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] with poissonian @xmath40 uncertainties based on the number of galaxies in each luminosity bin .",
    "however , since incompleteness is a potentially larger source of error , we recomputed the hxlfs by assigning all the spectroscopically unidentified sources to the center of each redshift interval ( i.e. , we included all the unidentified sources in both redshift intervals ) .",
    "dotted ( @xmath2 ) and dashed ( @xmath27 ) lines in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] show these maximal limits . because the spectroscopic identifications are much more complete at the high x - ray fluxes , the associated systematic uncertainties are larger at lower @xmath13 . in principle",
    "photometric redshifts can be estimated for the sources , and at higher redshifts this procedure is effective ( a. j. barger et al . , in preparation ) . however , over the @xmath41 range there could be considerable uncertainties in assigning photometric redshifts to sources with substantial agn contributions , so we prefer our more conservative approach .",
    "analyses of the hxlf using alternate techniques suggest that the lowest luminosity point in the determinations may be biased low ( e.g. page and carrera 2000 , miyaji et al .",
    "2001 ) but the effect is small compared to the statistical and systematic uncertainties .    at @xmath33  ergs",
    "s@xmath4 fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the familiar rise of the number counts with redshift .",
    "these counts are dominated by broad - line agn",
    ". however , at lower @xmath13 the @xmath2 counts lie above the @xmath27 counts , or are comparable if we use the maximal correction for incompleteness . since it is extremely unlikely that all the unidentified sources lie in the @xmath27 range ( this would result in a large deficiency at @xmath42 ) , the present - day number density of sources at @xmath43  ergs  s@xmath4 is higher than it was in the past .",
    "this result can not be significantly changed by highly obscured sources : the dot - dashed line shows the upper bound on the @xmath27 hxlf if we selected in observed - frame @xmath1  kev , which corresponds to rest - frame @xmath44  kev , and placed all the unidentified sources in this redshift interval .",
    "the resulting upper limit is a factor of @xmath45 higher than the upper limit obtained from the observed - frame @xmath0  kev selection .    all the x - ray sources are included in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] without regard to optical spectroscopic classification .",
    "previous hxlf analyses have generally focused on broad - line agn where the counterparts can be determined even in low resolution x - ray data ( e.g. , boyle et al .",
    "1998 ) . to make a direct comparison with these earlier studies , in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we plot our spectroscopically identified broad - line agn hxlfs in the intervals @xmath2 and @xmath27 with those derived by la franca et al .",
    "( 2002 ; @xmath46 ) from _ bepposax _ data and by miyaji et al .  ( 2001 ; @xmath27 ) from _ rosat _ data .",
    "our hxlfs agree with these brighter hxlfs in the overlap region where there is also some overlap in the datasets used . at @xmath43",
    "ergs  s@xmath4 there is little apparent evolution in the broad - line agn hxlf , while at higher luminosities the hxlf increases with redshift .",
    "in fig .  [ fig4]a we show the comoving number density evolution with redshift of @xmath47  ergs  s@xmath4 sources . at these luminosities",
    "the probability that the x - ray sources are powered by anything other than agn is extremely low , so we are mapping the evolution of intermediate luminosity agn . in the @xmath42 redshift bin",
    "we show the number densities from both observed - frame @xmath1  kev ( open squares ) and observed - frame @xmath0  kev ( solid diamonds ) ; the results are similar , although the soft band may be missing some obscured sources .",
    "the solid ( @xmath1  kev ) and dotted ( @xmath0  kev ) horizontal bars show the number densities obtained if all the spectroscopically unidentified sources are assigned redshifts at the center of each redshift bin .",
    "the bars are not consistent with one another because all the unidentified sources are included in all the bins .",
    "the number density of intermediate luminosity agn does not rise rapidly from @xmath48 to @xmath49 , in contrast to that of higher luminosity agn ( e.g. , miyaji et al .",
    "in fact , the evolution with increasing redshift is flat or declining .",
    "thus , agn traced by x - ray luminosity show their own version of downsizing , just as star - forming galaxies do ( cowie et al .",
    "high x - ray luminosity sources , which strongly overlap with broad - line agn ( quasar ) populations , peak at higher redshifts , while intermediate luminosity sources are still common now .    in fig",
    "[ fig4]b we show the evolution with redshift of the @xmath1  kev comoving luminosity density production rate of @xmath47  ergs  s@xmath4 sources ( @xmath50 ) .",

    "the largest uncertainty is the redshift distribution of the unidentified sources rather than the small effects of extrapolation outside our observed luminosity range .",
    "this incompleteness uncertainty is less than a factor of 2.9 even in the high redshift interval ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]b ) .",
    "we parameterize the evolution of @xmath50 as      where @xmath55 ranges from @xmath56 ( all unidentified sources in the low redshift interval ) to 1.1 ( all unidentified sources in the high redshift interval ) . if only identified sources are included , @xmath50 is roughly flat until the lowest @xmath57 interval in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] where it may drop slightly and @xmath58  @xmath59  ergs  s@xmath4  mpc@xmath52 .",
