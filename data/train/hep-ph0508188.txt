    "the heavy ion programme at the cern sps was aimed at detecting signals for deconfined quark and gluon matter . among the proposed signals",
    ", we shall consider here the enhancement of strange particle production , proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and observed by na49 and na57 , and the anomalous absorption of j/@xmath4 with respect to drell - yan pairs observed by na50 and na60 collaborations , following the theoretical suggestions in ref .",
    "@xcite .    until now , the two signals have been separately analysed , each of them giving circumstancial evidence for the production of a deconfined phase of hadronic matter . more conclusive evidence would be provided by a correlation between them .",
    "indeed , one expects that the melting of charmonia , as function of a suitable critical parameter , occurs _",
    "simultaneously _ to the reduction of the strange quark mass , which makes it easier for strange particles to reach thermal equilibrium and to appear abundantly among the hadrons formed at chemical freeze - out .    in this letter",
    "we would like to point out that indeed strangeness enhancement and @xmath0 suppression are strongly correlated when examined as function of the variable @xmath5 introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , related to the centrality of the collision . with reference to the beam axis",
    ", @xmath5 is the transverse size of the overlapping region of the two colliding nuclei : @xmath6 @xmath7 is the radius of the nuclei at rest ( we consider identical nuclei ) and @xmath8 the impact parameter .    to characterize strangeness production , we consider the strangeness undersaturation factor , or extra strangeness suppression factor , @xmath3 , used by many authors in the statistical analysis of hadron abundances .",
    "values of @xmath3 below unity mean that strange hadrons have not reached full chemical equilibrium in the hadron resonance gas .",
    "thus , @xmath3 measures how difficult is for strange hadrons to attain equilibrium starting from the initial collision of non - strange nuclear matter .",
    "our main result is shown in fig .  1 , where @xmath3 is reported as function of @xmath5 , together with the double ratio : @xmath9 indeed",
    ", @xmath3 departs from its low value in proton - proton or light nuclei collisions to approach unity in the same centrality range where @xmath10 drops below unity .",
    "the possibility of such a correlation has been suggested in  @xcite .",
    "an analysis of strange particle production versus centrality was given in  @xcite but no correlation with @xmath0 production was considered .",
    "our considerations are phenomenological in essence , however we stress that @xmath5 is a good candidate to regulate the onset of the critical behaviour .",
    "the transverse lenght determines the linear size of the initial fireball and therefore its initial volume .",
    "it is most reasonable that collective phenomena like the ones we are addressing can take place only when the hadron matter involved reaches a certain minimum volume .",
    "in addition , the number of nucleons per unit surface which take part in the collision increases with @xmath5 .",
    "correspondingly , the energy density deposited in the fireball  @xcite and its initial temperature both increase so that , by varying @xmath5 , we make a temperature scan which may lead into the critical or cross - over region .",
    "in fig .  2 , the observed @xmath0 rate , normalized to drell - yan pairs , is reported as a function of @xmath5 for pb - pb @xcite and in - in @xcite collisions .",
    "the @xmath0 attenuation function is defined by  @xcite : @xmath11    @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the number densities of nuclear matter and of the hadronic species @xmath14 in the fireball , respectively ; correspondingly , the cross sections @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the nucleon-@xmath0 and hadron-@xmath0 absorption cross sections .",
    "a thermal average is taken for the latter at temperature @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "the length @xmath18 is the average linear longitudinal size of the overlapping region of the two colliding nuclei .",
    "the values of @xmath18 as a function of the impact parameter @xmath8 , for pb and in , have been provided to us by the na50 and na60 collaborations   and we have derived the corresponding values of @xmath5 with eq.([elle ] ) and @xmath19  fm , for pb and in respectively . finally , @xmath20 is the average lenght traversed by a @xmath0 produced at random inside a sphere of diameter @xmath5 .    the dashed curves in fig .  2",
    "give the expected rates after nuclear absorption corrections as computed by na60  @xcite .",
    "solid curves include the hadronic absorption corrections , see eq.([abstot ] ) , ( upper = in , lower = pb for both dashed and solid lines ) .",
    "we outline here a few elements of the calculation of hadronic absorption given in ref .",
    "@xcite , and refer the reader to the original paper for details .",
    "pseudoscalar and vector mesons cross sections for : @xmath21 have been computed in the constituent quark model @xcite .",
    "the absorption length has been evaluated in a hadron gas at a temperature @xmath22  mev which was adjusted to reproduce the data points for @xmath23  fm.the meson chemical potentials were neglected as a reasonable first - order approximation .",
    "extrapolation to larger centralities requires the hadron gas equation of state ( eos ) , to convert the energy density into temperature .",
    "we have used the eos of a hagedorn gas with limiting temperature @xmath24  mev@xcite .",
    "the ratio observed ( experimental points ) to expected ( solid curves ) is plotted vs. @xmath5 in fig .  1 .",
    "primary strange particle densities in phase - space are parameterized according to : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the number of valence strange quarks and antiquarks in the particle , @xmath27 are a set of conserved charges , @xmath28 the corresponding chemical potentials and @xmath3 is the strange particle suppression factor . in order to obtain the parameters of the hadronic source at chemical freeze - out , i.e. , temperature @xmath17 , baryon - chemical potential @xmath29 and @xmath3 , we have fitted full - phase - space multiplicities to those measured in peripheral pb ",
    "pb collisions and central c  c , si  si and pb  pb collisions at maximum sps energy , @xmath30 gev .",
    "the fitting procedure is described in detail elsewhere @xcite ; the only difference with respect to ref .",
    "@xcite is that we have used an updated hadronic data set @xcite .",
    "a more detailed report on these fits is the subject of a separate publication @xcite .    for central c ",
    "si we have used the average multiplicities of @xmath31 , k@xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 s  @xcite measured by the experiment na49 . for central pb  pb the data sample by na49 includes @xmath31 @xcite , k@xmath32 @xcite , k@xmath35 @xcite , @xmath33 @xcite , @xmath34 s @xcite , @xmath36 s @xcite and @xmath37 s @xcite .",
    "these data samples are large enough to determine unambiguously the source parameters quoted in table  1 . on the other hand , for peripheral collisions ,",
    "the full - phase - space multiplicities measured by na49 , i.e. @xmath38 @xcite and k @xcite , together with the number of wounded nucleons @xmath39 @xcite , are not sufficient to determine the source parameters . for an unambiguous fit ,",
    "we need at least one ratio antibaryon / baryon , in order to determine the baryon - chemical potential .",
    "once this is given , the ratio @xmath40 fixes the temperature and , in turn , the k/@xmath38 ratio fixes the strangeness suppression factor , @xmath3 .",
    "antibaryon yields as a function of centrality have been measured by the na57 collaboration @xcite .",
    "these yields cover only one unit of rapidity around midrapidity , however , so that some extrapolation to full - phase - space is necessary . to keep to a minimum the uncertainty related to the extrapolation",
    ", we have used the ratio @xmath41 , because the rapidity distributions measured by na49 in central collisions of both particle and antiparticle are gaussians to a very good approximation and an extrapolation is definitely more reliable than for @xmath34 s .",
    "the procedure was as follows :    1 .",
    "we have fitted the @xmath42 and @xmath43 rapidity distributions measured by na49 in central collisions @xcite to gaussians with normalization and width @xmath44 left as free parameters and central value @xmath45 fixed ; 2 .   assuming that the single gaussian shape and the ratio between their widths does not change as a function of centrality , we have estimated the yields in full phase space by rescaling the ratio @xmath41 at midrapidity measured by na57 by the ratio of the widths ; in fact , for a single gaussian , the relation between midrapidity yield @xmath46 and @xmath47 reads @xmath48 .",
    "the quality of the gaussian fits is excellent and the widths of rapidity distributions turn out to be @xmath49 for @xmath42 and @xmath50 for @xmath43 , implying a ratio @xmath51 .",
    "the obtained values of @xmath41 in full - phase - space are quoted in table  1 for the different centrality bins .",
    "it should be remarked that the na57 centrality bins corresponding to the @xmath36 s yield values slightly different from those of na49 .",
    "however , this should imply a negligible error because the @xmath41 is fairly constant over the whole centrality range .",
    "the obtained source parameters for each centrality bin in pb  pb and for central c  c and si ",
    "si collisions are quoted in table  1 .",
    "the fit quality is good throughout .",
    "temperature and baryon - chemical potential are essentially constant regardless of centrality and colliding system size .",
    "as expected , freeze - out temperatures are smaller than the temperature derived from @xmath0 opacity for @xmath23  fm , which refers to the initial stage of the fireball .    unlike @xmath17 and @xmath52 ,",
    "the strangeness suppression parameter @xmath3 varies considerably between the most central and the most peripheral bin in pb  pb . also , @xmath3 is significantly smaller in central c  c and si ",
    "si than in pb  pb collisions .",
    "these results are in agreement and confirm a previous analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite where a slightly different data set was used .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "an intriguing question about the strangeness production pattern in heavy ion collisions is whether a regular behaviour exists as a function of system size . indeed , as can be seen in fig .  3 , @xmath3 is larger in central light - ion collisions than in the most peripheral heavy - ion collisions , where it approaches the value found in pp collisions @xcite .",
    "the search of an appropriate scaling variable for @xmath3 has been recently performed e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a scaling of @xmath3 as a function of the fraction of multiply struck participants in the glauber model was pointed out .",
    "a different approach is to look for an underlying physical mechanism implying the undersaturation of the strange phase space , with @xmath3 thus becoming an effective parametrization of a more complicated physical picture : for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite a two - component model was proposed in which particle production stems from the superposition of a fully equilibrated hadron gas with @xmath53 and single nucleon - nucleon collisions , where strangeness is strongly suppressed @xcite ; hhne _ et al . _ @xcite put forward a multi - cluster model where strangeness undersaturation is achieved by means of the so - called canonical suppression .",
    "the aim of explaining @xmath3 in terms of a more fundamental physical scheme is certainly worth being pursued .",
    "however , it is a remarkable fact that , whatever its origin , strangeness undersaturation apparently scales with a pure geometrical variable such as @xmath5 , as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "in order to compare strangeness production to the @xmath0 anomalous suppression pattern one needs to find the @xmath5 values corresponding to the centrality bins defined by na49 . the subdivision is done on the basis of the number of projectile spectators measured in the forward calorimeter whose relevant fractions @xcite are quoted in table  1 . the conversion to @xmath5 can be carried out by means of a monte - carlo simulation of the glauber model .",
    "our monte - carlo simulation of the glauber model follows the traditional scheme @xcite : at a given impact parameter , the number of collisions of each projectile nucleon is randomly extracted from a poisson distribution whose mean is the product of the thickness function times the inelastic nucleon - nucleon cross - section . for the target nucleons ,",
    "the number of collisions undergone by each of them is randomly extracted from a multinomial distribution constrained with the total number of collisions as determined in the previous step and whose weights are proportional to the product of their relevant thickness function times the inelastic nucleon - nucleon cross - section .",
    "the thickness function has been calculated on the basis of a woods - saxon distribution : @xmath54 with parameters quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath55 an issue in the calculation of @xmath5 is the definition of the radius @xmath7 if , as it was the case , a woods - saxon distribution is used .",
    "in fact , different definitions ( e.g. the equivalent spherical radius , square mean radius etc . ) result in different values of @xmath5 , though not dramatically . in the study of @xmath0 anomalous suppression ,",
    "a value of 6.5 fm was adopted for the pb radius , as mentioned above . to be consistent",
    ", we define the carbon and silicon radii as those encompassing the same fraction of the woods - saxon distribution as for the pb nucleus with 6.5 fm , namely 81% with our parametrization ( [ ws ] ) .",
    "this leads to @xmath56 fm and @xmath57 fm .",
    "the resulting @xmath5 distributions for the na49 different centrality bins in pb ",
    "pb collisions are shown in fig .",
    "1 gives convincing evidence that neither nuclear nor hadronic absorption can explain the drop in @xmath0 production at @xmath58  fm . in a quark gluon plasma , the sudden drop indicated by pb and in data",
    "would be attributed to the disappearance of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , which account for a sizable fraction of the observed @xmath0s in nucleon - nucleon collisions . to define precisely the expected signal in this case ,",
    "however , one should have divided the experimental data by the @xmath0 absorption coefficient in the qgp medium .",
    "this may explain the residual slope displayed by the pb points in fig .  1 , for @xmath61  fm .",
    "the limiting hadronic absorption estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite , see eq .",
    "( [ abstot ] ) , is @xmath62  @xmath63 . to produce a flat behavior of the pb points , one would need rather @xmath64 . to our knowledge , there are no theoretical calculations available of the qgp absorption coefficient , which would be very useful for charmonium and bottomonium phenomenology at rhic and lhc as well .",
    "a second remark concerns @xmath5 dependence .",
    "one may wonder whether the energy density deposited in the fireball would be a more appropriate variable to use .",
    "indeed , a plot of @xmath0 absorption vs. energy density estimated with the bjorken formula shows better scaling of pb and in data .",
    "conversely , the result for @xmath3 looks like fig .",
    "3 and scaling is not achieved : the estimated energy density in central si ",
    "si collisions is in fact significantly smaller than that in peripheral pb ",
    "pb collisions , whereas the converse is true for @xmath3 values .",
    "errors are still large , however , and more precise data as well as data from other a  a collisions are needed for better understanding .    in conclusion , we have pointed out that @xmath0 suppression and strangeness enhancement are correlated to the transverse size of the interaction region in heavy ion collisions at sps energies , @xmath5 . we can not offer an explanation in terms of fundamental physics and the present result is phenomenological .",
    "however it is interesting to note that @xmath5 determines the initial volume of the fireball and the energy density deposited by the collision .",
    "collective phenomena like the ones we are addressing can take place most likely only when the hadron matter involved reaches a certain minimum volume and energy density and @xmath5 may thus be a good candidate for a critical lenght .",
    "the correlation we observe makes considerably stronger the case for the sps being right at the onset of qgp formation .",
    "further experimental investigations in this energy range are clearly called for , to elucidate the nature of the transition .",
