    "high - energy laser oscillators nowadays allow high - intensity experiments such as direct gas ionization @xcite , where the level of intensity must be of the order of 10@xmath0 w/@xmath1 .",
    "one can expect soon pump - probe diffraction experiments with electrons and direct high - harmonic generation in gases and production of nm - scale structures at the surface of transparent materials .",
    "each case calls for an intensity of the order of that demonstrated above or higher , which means generating tens up to hundreds of @xmath2j pulses at the fundamental mhz repetition rate of an oscillator @xcite . from the examples above it",
    "can be seen that high repetition rates are preferable to khz rates ( now commercially available ) because the signal rates in , for example , electron experiments are usually low and an improvement factor of 10@xmath3 ",
    "10@xmath4 due to the higher repetition rate of the pulses significantly enhances the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "in addition to this physical factor , existing khz systems are more expensive , complex and less stable .",
    "there are a few ways of increasing the oscillator pulse energy @xmath5 , which is a product of the average power and the repetition period : by increasing the cavity length and/or increasing the power @xcite .",
    "the catch is that a long - cavity oscillator suffers from instabilities owing to nonlinear effects caused by the high pulse peak power @xmath6 .",
    "the leverage is to stretch a pulse and thereby decrease its peak power below the instability threshold .",
    "recent progress demonstrating the feasibility of this approach has been achieved for ti : sapphire oscillators operating in both the negative- ( ndr ) @xcite and positive - dispersion regimes ( pdr ) @xcite , for near - infrared yb - doped solid - state oscillators operating in both the ndr @xcite and the pdr @xcite , and for fiber oscillators operating in the all - normal dispersion ( andi ) ( i.e. positive dispersion ) regime @xcite .",
    "the fundamental difference between the ndr and pdr is that , in the former , the schrdinger soliton develops @xcite .",
    "the soliton width @xmath7 and energy @xmath5 can be expressed as @xcite    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the self - phase modulation ( spm ) coefficient of a nonlinear medium ( active crystal , fiber , air , etc . ) , and @xmath10 is the net - group - delay - dispersion ( gdd ) coefficient of an oscillator cavity . since the peak power @xmath6 has to be kept lower than the threshold value @xmath11 in order to avoid soliton destabilization , one can estimate the maximum attainable energy as @xmath12 .",
    "energy scaling thus requires pulse stretching .",
    "however , the latter results from the substantial gdd growth [ quadratically with energy , see eq .",
    "( [ soliton ] ) ] :    @xmath13    hence , the pulse width increases linearly with energy ( correspondingly , the spectrum narrows with @xmath5 ) . as a result ,",
    "i ) energy scaling requires a huge negative gdd , ii ) the soliton obtained has a large width , and iii ) it is not compressible linearly .",
    "in contrast to the soliton regime , the pulse is stretched in the pdr @xcite and its peak power is reduced due to chirp @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the chirp compensates the narrowing of the spectrum with energy @xcite :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the spectrum half - width .",
    "the advantage is that such a pulse [ chirped solitary pulse ( csp ) ] is compressible linearly down to @xmath17 ( the compression factor is @xmath18 ) .",
    "as was found , the csp can be described as a solitary pulse solution of the cubic nonlinear complex ginzburg - landau equation ( cgle ) @xcite or , more generally , the cubic - quintic nonlinear cgle @xcite .",
    "this equation is the generalized form of the master mode - locking equation @xcite , which provides an adequate description of mode - locked oscillators ( both fiber and solid - state ones ) .",
    "furthermore , the nonlinear cgle is used in quantum optics , modeling of bose - einstein condensation , condensed - matter physics , study of non - equilibrium phenomena , and nonlinear dynamics , quantum mechanics of self - organizing dissipative systems , and quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "therefore , analysis of the csp solutions of nonlinear cgle is of interest not only from the practical but also from the theoretical point of view .",
    "since the underlying problem is multiparameter and not integrable in the general form , there is no a uniform standpoint on csps developing in , for example , the andi fiber oscillator @xcite and the chirped - pulse oscillator ( cpo ) @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the physical parameters of oscillators vary greatly and it is not clear _ a priori _ whether the mechanisms governing the pdr are unified .    in this work , we propose an approximate method of integrating the generalized nonlinear cgle and show that the csp is its two - parametrical solitary pulse solution . as a result ,",
    "the csp characteristics are easy to trace on a two - dimensional diagram ( `` master diagram '' ) .",
    "comparison of the pdr parameters demonstrates that the csps formed in the andi fiber oscillator and in the cpo i ) lie within distinct sectors of the unified master diagram , ii ) belong to mainly distinct branches of the solution , and iii ) vary with the parameters in different ways .",
    "the variation of the main cpo characteristics ( spectrum shape and width as well as pulse stability ) with the pdr parameters is analyzed along with the numerical and experimental results .",
    "a comparison of the models based on the different versions of the master equation is made .",
    "the evolution of the visible , near- and mid - infrared electromagnetic fields in an oscillator can be described on the basis of the slowly - varying field approximation , when the spectral width is much smaller than the carrier frequency of the field .",
    "the field envelope @xmath19 is affected mainly by i ) gdd , ii ) spm ( non - dissipative factors ) , as well as iii ) saturable gain and linear loss , iv ) spectral filtering , and v ) self - amplitude modulation ( sam ) ( dissipative factors ) @xcite .",
    "when the effects of higher - order dispersion @xcite and the field variation along a single oscillator round - trip @xcite are negligible , the oscillator dynamics obeys the nonlinear cgle :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the propagation distance normalized to the oscillator length ( for a ring oscillator model ; or to double its length for a linear oscillator ) , @xmath22 is the local time [ the reference frame is co - moving with a solitary pulse solution of eq .",

    "<S> a completely analytical and unified approach to the theory of chirped - pulse oscillators is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the approach developed is based on the approximate integration of the generalized nonlinear complex ginzburg - landau equation and demonstrates that a chirped - pulse oscillator is controlled by only two parameters . </S>",
    "<S> it makes it easy to trace spread of the real - world characteristics of both solid - state and fiber oscillators operating in the positive dispersion regime . </S>"
