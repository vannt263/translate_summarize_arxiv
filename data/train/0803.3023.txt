    "<S> the magneto - optical absorption properties of graphene multilayers are theoretically studied . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the spectrum can be decomposed into sub - components effectively identical to the monolayer or bilayer graphene , allowing us to understand the spectrum systematically as a function of the layer number . </S>",
    "<S> odd - layered graphenes always exhibit absorption peaks which shifts in proportion to @xmath0 , with @xmath1 being the magnetic field , due to the existence of an effective monolayer - like subband . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a possibility of observing the monolayer - like spectrum even in a mixture of multilayer graphene films with various layers numbers . </S>"
