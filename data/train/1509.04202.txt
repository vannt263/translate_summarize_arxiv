    "the aim of this paper is to study a weak transport cost and its associated weak transport - entropy inequality , both introduced by four of the authors in @xcite , on the real line . in order to present our results",
    ", we shall first introduce the various mathematical objects of interest to us , placing and motivating their significance within the classical theory of optimal transport and its connection with the concentration of measure phenomenon .    throughout the paper",
    ", @xmath0 denotes the set of borel probability measures on @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the subset of probability measures having a finite first moment .",
    "let @xmath3 , with @xmath4 , be a measurable function referred to as the _ cost _ function .",
    "then , the usual optimal _ transport cost _ , in the sense of kantorovich , between two probability measures @xmath5 and @xmath6 on @xmath1 is defined by @xmath7 where the infimum runs over the set of couplings @xmath8 between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , _",
    "i.e. , _  probability measures on @xmath9 such that @xmath10 and @xmath11 .    since the works by marton @xcite and talagrand @xcite , these transport costs have been extensively used as a tool to reach concentration properties for measures on product spaces",
    ". more precisely , optimal transport is related to the concentration of measure phenomenon via the so - called transport - entropy inequalities that we now recall .",
    "a probability measure @xmath5 on @xmath1 is said to satisfy the transport - entropy inequality @xmath12 , if for all @xmath13 , it holds @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the relative entropy ( also called kullback - leibler distance ) of @xmath6 with respect to @xmath5 , defined by @xmath16 if @xmath6 is absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath5 , and @xmath17 otherwise .",
    "note that we focus on the line , but that all the above definitions easily generalize to probability measures on a general metric space . as a special case ,",
    "as proved by talagrand in his seminal paper @xcite , inequality is satisfied by the standard gaussian measure for the cost @xmath18 . by extension",
    ", we shall say that @xmath5 satisfies the inequality @xmath19 ( often referred to as `` talagrand s inequality '' in the literature ) , if holds for a cost function of the form @xmath20 , for some @xmath21 .",
    "we refer to the books or survey @xcite for a complete presentation of transport - entropy inequalities and of the concentration of measure phenomenon , as well as for bibliographic references in the field .    in the next few lines we shall shortly discuss the consequences of transport - entropy inequalities in terms of concentration . for simplicity we may only consider inequality @xmath19 .    as discovered by marton and talagrand , when a probability @xmath5 satisfies @xmath19 , then for _ all _ positive integers @xmath22 , and all functions @xmath23 which are @xmath24-lipschitz with respect to the euclidean norm on @xmath25 , it holds @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the median of @xmath28 under @xmath29 we refer to @xcite for a presentation of the numerous applications of this type of dimension - free concentration of measure inequalities .",
    "conversely , it was shown by the first named author in @xcite that a probability @xmath5 satisfying the dimension - free gaussian concentration necessarily satisfies @xmath19 , thus giving to inequality @xmath30 a special status among other functional inequalities appearing in the concentration of measure literature . the key argument explaining why talagrand s inequality implies the dimension - free concentration behavior is the well - known tensorisation property enjoyed in general by inequalities of the form @xmath12 ( see _ e.g. _",
    "the tensorisation property shows in particular that if @xmath5 satisfies @xmath19 , then the @xmath22-fold product measure @xmath31 also satisfies @xmath19 ( on @xmath25 ) with the same constant @xmath32 .    more generally , given a measure on a product space ( which is not necessarily a product measure ) , and assuming that each of its conditional one - dimensional marginals satisfies a transport - entropy inequality , several authors have obtained , using different non - independent tensorisation strategies , transport - entropy inequalities for the whole measure under weak dependence assumptions ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "then , the transport - entropy inequality for the whole measure leads again to concentration properties using the same classical arguments as in the product case .",
    "thus , in many situations one is reduced to verify the one - dimensional transport - entropy inequalities , and therefore it is of a real interest to characterize those probability measures @xmath5 on @xmath1 that satisfy the inequality @xmath30 and more generally @xmath12 for a general cost function @xmath33 .    in this direction ,",
    "the first - named author obtained , in @xcite , necessary and sufficient conditions for @xmath12 to hold , when the cost function @xmath34 is continuous , convex and quadratic near @xmath35 . in order to present such conditions , we need to introduce some notations .",
    "denote by @xmath36 $ ] , @xmath37 , the cumulative distribution function of a probability measure @xmath5 and by @xmath38 its general inverse defined by @xmath39.\\ ] ] the conditions obtained in @xcite are expressed in terms of the behavior of the modulus of continuity of the non - decreasing map @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the symmetric exponential distribution on @xmath1 , @xmath42 so that @xmath43 by construction , @xmath44 is the unique left - continuous and non - decreasing map transporting @xmath41 onto @xmath5 ( _ i.e. _  @xmath45 for all @xmath28 ) . in the special case of the inequality @xmath30 , the characterization of @xcite reads as follows : a probability measure @xmath5 satisfies @xmath19 for some @xmath32 if and only the following holds    * for some constant @xmath46 and all @xmath47 , it holds @xmath48 * for some constant @xmath49 and all @xmath28 of class @xmath50 , the poincar inequality holds @xmath51    we refer to @xcite for a precise quantitative relation between @xmath52 and @xmath53 .    in the present paper , partly following @xcite , we focus on the study of a new weak transport - entropy inequality introduced in @xcite that is related to a weak type of dimension - free concentration . more precisely , in dimension one , we consider the weak optimal transport cost of @xmath6 with respect to @xmath5 defined by @xmath54 where the infimum runs over all couplings @xmath55 of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and where @xmath56 denotes the disintegration kernel of @xmath8 with respect to its first marginal .",
    "the notation bar comes from the barycenter entering in its definition .",
    "note that , contrary to the usual transport cost , @xmath57 is not symmetric .",
    "also , in terms of random variables , one has the following interpretation @xmath58 whereas @xmath59 , where in both cases the infimum runs over all random variables @xmath60 such that @xmath61 follows the law @xmath5 and @xmath62 the law @xmath6 . as a consequence , when @xmath33 is convex , by jensen s inequality , one has @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , if a measure @xmath5 satisfies @xmath12 then it also satisfies the following weaker transport - entropy inequalities .",
    "[ defitrans ] let @xmath64 be a convex cost function .",

    "in particular , the inequality @xmath70 appears as the dual formulation of the so - called convex @xmath71-property introduced by maurey @xcite ( see also @xcite for further development ) .",
    "the above defined weak transport - entropy inequalities are of particular interest since the class of measures satisfying such inequalities also includes discrete measures on @xmath1 such as bernoulli , binomial and poisson measures @xcite . in comparison ,",
    "the classical talagrand s transport inequality ( and more generally any @xmath12 ) is never satisfied by a discrete probability measure unless it is a dirac to be connected . ] .",
    "moreover these weak transport - entropy inequalities also enjoy the tensorisation property ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "we shall prove the following characterization ( the main result of the paper ) of the transport inequalities @xmath70 associated to any convex cost function @xmath33 which is quadratic near @xmath35 . in the sequel we may use the following standard notation @xmath77 for the function @xmath78 .

    "@xmath12 given in @xcite , one sees that only the condition on the modulus of continuity of @xmath44 remains .",
    "nevertheless , as we shall explain below , the poincar inequality has not completely disappeared from the picture .    also , denoting by @xmath94 the modulus of continuity of @xmath44 defined by @xmath95 condition",
    "@xmath89 asserts that @xmath96 therefore @xmath94 is bounded above near zero but does not necessarily go to zero , as @xmath97 goes to zero .",
