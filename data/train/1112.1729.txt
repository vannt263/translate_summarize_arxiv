    "the physical origin of the gaseous halo and its evolving interplay with its host galaxy , however , are not well understood .",
    "gas in the halo could be fuel for continued star formation in the galaxy ( e.g. , maller & bullock 2004 ) , or could be a result of gas blown out by galactic winds ( e.g. , steidel et  al .",
    "2010 ) , or both .",
    "it is clear that the gas is clumped and not distributed spherically ( e.g. , churchill , kacprzak & steidel 2005 ) , but the typical covering fraction is still uncertain .",
    "the spatial extent of the mgii  absorbing region has been constrained by various studies , although they do not always agree .",
    "the extent could be related to the mass of the galaxy ( e.g. , tinker & chen 2008 , steidel , dickinson & persson 1994 , lovegrove & simcoe 2011 ) or to the colour and star - formation rate of the galaxy ( e.g. , zibetti et  al .",

    "tinker & chen ( 2008 ) ( hereafter tc08 ) have constructed a semi - analytical model for gas absorbing in the mgii  @xmath112796    transition within a dark matter ( dm ) halo using an isothermal density profile .",
    "the rest - frame absorption equivalent width @xmath12 ( absorption due to the 2796    transition of the mgii  doublet at some projected distance @xmath13 from the centre of the absorbing gaseous halo , hereafter @xmath14 ) is determined by the amount of cold gas , in the form of discrete clouds , along the line of sight ( los ) through a halo .",
    "they constrained their model using a mgii - lrg cross - correlation function and a mgii  absorbing frequency distribution function .    in chen &",
    "tinker ( 2008 ) , the authors further constrained the tc08 model using a sample of mgii  absorption features near known galaxies .",
    "the sample consisted of 13 galaxy and absorber pairs and 10 galaxies that do not produce mgii  absorption lines to within sensitive upper limits .",
    "a maximum likelihood analysis showed that the model best describes the observations if the covering fraction is 80 - 86% .",
    "the data had a weighted mean rest - frame equivalent width of 0.34   .",
    "in this study we present a new test of the tc08 model , using mgii  absorption features in the lines of sight to lensed and multiple quasar systems .",
    "these systems can provide two or more lines of sight through the same galaxy halo . by comparing the coincident and anti - coincident absorption systems in multiple lines of sight , constraints on both the covering fraction and coherence scale can be determined ( e.g. , ellison et  al .",

    "here we describe the framework of the tc08 model and how we applied the tabulated data from the literature and coding to test it .",

    "the result is a shock - heated region at the centre of the gaseous halo in which the cold mgii  absorbing gas can no longer survive .    to incorporate this effect , tc08 introduce a parameter @xmath41 which is the radius of the transition from shock - heated gas to colder gas . at @xmath42",

    "the tc08 model was tested against 13 galaxy / absorber pairs in chen & tinker ( 2008 ) where a cosmic scatter of 0.25 in the log was observed .",
    "with such a large cosmic scatter , a pair of sight - lines with increasingly smaller separation still has the potential to have significantly different absorption equivalent widths .",
    "we expect there to be some scale at small separations over which the absorption equivalent width will not vary between sight - lines . to account for this we introduce a characteristic length , denoted @xmath3 .",
    "below @xmath3 , the cosmic scatter is suppressed exponentially so that at zero sight - line separation , the difference in cosmic scatter between sight - lines is zero ( see section [ simforpairs ] for more details ) .",
    "we include a halo absorbing fraction @xmath75 as defined in tc08 .",
    "this is the probability that a dark matter halo has any gaseous halo capable of absorbing at all .",
    "more details on this parameter can be found in section [ selectmass ] .",
    "we also introduce a covering fraction term , @xmath2 , which measures the fraction of sight - lines within @xmath33 that do not show absorption ( see section [ cov_frac ] for more details ) .",
    "there are a total of seven free parameters required to fully describe a gaseous halo in our model .",
    "tc08 determined the values for five of these parameters . in this study",
    "we have varied the remaining two , the characteristic length and covering fraction , in order to find the best fit values .",
    "the characteristic length @xmath3 is varied over @xmath76  kpc and the covering fraction @xmath2 is varied over @xmath77 .",
    "we aim to determine if the variation in ew between sight - lines in the observed data set ( tables [ pairstable ] and [ quadewtable ] ) is consistent with the tc08 model , and over what range of characteristic length and covering fraction that consistency holds by simulating sight - lines in a gaseous halo described by the tc08 model .",
    "we begin by choosing a mass at random from a halo mass function .",
    "the mass defines the radius of the gaseous halo , and the size of the shock heated region .",
    "we take a random impact parameter from within the gaseous halo and calculate the equivalent width predicted by the tc08 model , based on equations ( [ w1]-[w3 ] ) .",
    "we search through all ew values measured to better than @xmath22 in the observed data set for a match to the predicted ew .",
    "the matched ew represents one los from the corresponding quasar asterism .",
    "we use the tc08 model to then predict the ews of the other lines of sight in the asterism , given the mass of the halo and the impact parameter that was used in the original match . for each line of sight in the observed data set with an ew measured to better than @xmath22",
    ", we compile 900 ews that match to within observational error . for each of the 900 matches",
    ", we then use the tc08 model to predict the ews for each of the other lines of sight in the asterism , given an assumed characteristic length scale @xmath3 and covering fraction @xmath2 of the absorption . using the resulting distribution of predicted ews",
    ", we calculate the probability that the tc08 model can accurately predict the observed variation between lines of sight for each combination of @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "this statistical approach marginalizes the mass of the dark matter halo , the impact parameter of the sight - line relative to the centre of the gaseous halo , and the orientation of the asterism within the halo .",
    "below we describe how we determine these parameters , and how we generate simulated samples of ews to compare with the observed ews .",
    "we select a mass randomly from a weighted halo mass function .",
    "the weight we have already defined as @xmath75 , the probability that a given dark matter halo of mass @xmath30 will have a gaseous halo from which absorption can be measured , as not all halos contain a gaseous region . the halo mass function quantifies the number of dark matter halos as a function of halo mass .",
    "tc08 utilize the halo mass function of warren et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) , determined by numerical simulations of structure growth and halo formation . multiplying the mass function by @xmath78 results in an absorption weighted halo mass function , allowing proper sampling of the mass range for dark matter halos that would be observed in our data set .    in tc08 , however ,",
    "@xmath78 is degenerate with the covering fraction of the gaseous halo .",
    "so the authors combine the probability that a given dark matter halo will have a gaseous halo that will absorb in mgii , and the probability that a given line of sight inside the gaseous region will produce mgii  absorption . in this paper , we are required to explain cases of absorption in only one of two lines of sight that lie within @xmath33 .",
    "since we require there to already be a match to one line of sight in an asterism ( discussed in ",
    "[ simforpairs ] ) , we are not double counting the effects of covering fraction by using @xmath78 and @xmath2 .",
    "instead of parameterizing the mass dependence of @xmath78 , tc08 specified the values of @xmath78 at four different masses and interpolated between them .",
    "the four masses used were @xmath79 10.0 , 11.33 , 12.66 , and 14.0 .",
    "the four corresponding values of @xmath78 are denoted @xmath80 and @xmath81 . in tc08 , the best fit values for @xmath78 at each @xmath82 were determined ; their values were : @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 .",
    "we adopt the same parameters and interpolate linearly between them ; the plot in figure [ fhprofile ] shows the dependence of @xmath78 on mass ( both in the log ) .    for the sake of simplicity , we approximate the halo mass function as a power law ( @xmath87 ) that we sample over the range @xmath88 . in warren",
    "( 2006 ) , the parameterization is actually a power law combined with an exponential decay at high masses ( @xmath89 ) , however , our sampling of masses in this range is negligible and so we consider our approximation to be sufficiently accurate . from the power law portion of the warren",
    "( 2006 ) halo mass function , we measure @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , our weighted halo mass function is defined as @xmath91 such that we have a normalized weighted halo mass function with sampling range @xmath92 . a plot of @xmath93 is located in figure [ massfunc ] , where @xmath94 represents the weighted number of absorbers .",
    "as noted in tc08 , the weighted mass function peaks at @xmath95 , and nearly all halos of @xmath96 are expected to host mgii  absorption . at lower masses ,",
    "the halo mass function has a relatively high normalization but the low value of @xmath78 makes the probability of finding an mgii  absorber in the dark matter halo low , and thus we have a small chance of observing them . at higher masses , @xmath78 is relatively high but the number of halos is much lower , making the probability of observing a mgii  absorber at such halo masses very unlikely .    the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of the weighted halo mass function is plotted in figure [ cdf ] .",
    "this plot shows that the masses we are most likely to be studying are approximately @xmath97 .",
    "all other masses have a low probability of exhibiting mgii  absorption , although we still sample over the range @xmath98 .",
    "the cdf allows us to randomly select dark matter halo masses to properly represent the statistical distribution of dark matter halos in the universe that will harbour mgii  absorbing gas .",
    "this model assumes no evolution of the halo mass distribution of absorbers with redshift , which has been suggested by observational evidence in lundgren et  al .",
    "( 2011 ) .     for all values of mass .",

    "we also describe how we test this distribution of simulated data against the observed data in table [ pairstable ] .",
    "it is important to note that when simulating ews we search for matches to both losa and losb in the observed quasar pair .",

    "each run of simulations begins by choosing and fixing the characteristic length and covering fraction combination to be used during the run .",
