    "the development of methods that include van der waals forces in density functional theory ( dft ) has made it possible to describe an abundance of important material systems  like water,@xcite dna,@xcite molecular crystals,@xcite and metal - organic frameworks@xcite  at the electronic level even without use of empirical parameters .",
    "such materials can be categorized as sparse matter , because of the essential role of the low ( electron ) density regions or `` voids '' in these materials .",
    "these regions make it paramount to go beyond semi - local approximations like the generalized - gradient approximation  ( gga)@xcite and properly account for van der waals interactions .",
    "a good description of sparse matter is important for developing new nanotechnology .",
    "the softer van der waals bonds makes it easy for fragments to move , like in the self assembly of molecules on surfaces  @xcite or for moving pieces of nano - mechanical devices.@xcite    sparse matter constitutes a research - frontier for dft and dft - based modelling.@xcite practical and robust schemes to describe sparse matter are all fairly recently developed and several competing and complimentary methods exist .",
    "two prominent approaches are vdw - corrected dft and the use of non - local correlation functionals .",
    "the first approach adds a semi - empirical pair - potential correction accounting for van der waals forces on top of semi - local dft.@xcite there exist many variation thereof and refinements , like adjusting the pair - potentials by using charge - density input.@xcite non - local correlation functionals aim to stay fully within dft keeping the density as the key variable .",
    "the van der waals density functional  ( vdw - df ) method@xcite for approximating the exchange - correlation energy has led to a series of such functionals that lack empirical input .",
    "the vdw - df1,@xcite introduced in 2004 , and vdw - df2,@xcite introduced in 2012 , emphasise a constraint - based design of the density fluctuation propagator,@xcite while the precursor for layered systems@xcite emphasise an anisotropic screening account .",
    "the vdw - dfs vanish seamlessly in the uniform limit@xcite and exhibits the correct @xmath0 asymptotic limit between molecular dimers.@xcite the prediction of various sparse matter methods can differ quite much .    hand in hand with the development and refinements of sparse matter methods ,",
    "it is essential to identify experiments and quantum - chemistry calculations that serves to test and elucidate these methods for various physical effects and across length scales.@xcite one approach is to construct a representative data set that account for many physical effects,@xcite like the s22 data set@xcite or the more recent and larger s66.@xcite the average performance of methods can then be compared to each other .",
    "another approach is to identify particular systems and associated experiments that reveal several properties of sparse matter binding.@xcite an example is to calculate potential energy curves  ( pec ) of h@xmath1 on cu(111 ) and compare with the experimental ones constructed from backscattering experiments.@xcite since the balance between the different contributions to pec change with separation , much information can be extracted .        in this paper , we show that the details of adsorption , especially the predicted corrugation for adsorbate dynamics is a discriminator for assessing the balance between exchange and correlation components in a non - local functional design .",
    "we substantiate our conclusion by comparing the results of calculations using vdw - df1 and vdw - df2 and associated exchange choices for a group of adsorbate systems that are closely related , yet the nature of the binding differs in a well - defined manner .",
    "we study the adsorption of benzene and c60 on graphene and bn .",
    "we show how these systems allow us to span , in a systematic manner , a wide range of different contributions to sparse matter binding .",
    "first , the interface between a benzene and graphene ( or bn ) is very similar to that of c60 on graphene ( or bn ) , both in terms of contact area and character of the local bonds .",
    "yet c60 is bigger and the difference in adsorption is mostly induced by the increased van der waals attraction of the c60 molecule .",
    "second , boron nitride and graphene are both flat one - atom layer thick sheets with eight valence electrons per unit cell , but whereas graphene is a semi - metal , bn is an insulator .",
    "the bn sheet also has a somewhat different charge - density landscape than the graphene sheet .",
    "we show that the corrugation is very sensitive to the binding separation and therefore very sensitive to the version of correlation and exchange in particular used in vdw - df . yet at a given separation to the surface , the corrugation is largely independent of the functional version used .",
    "the shorter binding separation for c60 adsorbants compared to benzene increase corrugation in the same indirect manner .    based on our results and analysis , we suggest a combined theory - experiment approach that can lead to insight into the nature of sparse matter binding and the magnitude of the different terms in the exchange - correlation functional .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : after the introduction we summarize vdw - df method and functional versions and variants and outline computational details specific to this study .",
    "section  [ sec : adsorption ] presents our results for adsorption of benzene and c60 on graphene and boron nitride . in section  [ sec : analysis ] we analyze the various components to this binding , both the importance of gga exchange choice and vdw - df correlation version .",
    "we also analyze the role of different density separations and density regimes in the non - local correlation of vdw - df .",
    "section  [ sec : corrugation ] compares the corrugation of the different systems and for the different functionals .",
    "section  [ sec : discussion ] discuss the possibility of using the selected systems to assess the quality of non - local correlation functionals and sparse - matter methods in general .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions .",
    "the vdw - df method is designed to handle both short - range covalent bonds and long - range van der waals interactions without introducing damping functions or empiricism .",
    "its exchange - correlation functional combines exchange at the gga level , @xmath2 with the combination of correlation in the local density approximation ( lda ) and non - local correlation : @xmath3 .",
    "the non - local correlation is responsible for the van der waals interaction .",
    "the non - local correlation term vanishes in the uniform limit and takes the form of a six dimensional integral @xmath4= { \\frac{1}{2}}\\int{\\text{d}}^3 { \\mathbf{r}}\\int{\\text{d}}^3 { \\mathbf{r}}'\\ , n({\\mathbf{r } } ) \\phi[n]({\\mathbf{r}},{\\mathbf{r } } ' ) n({\\mathbf{r}}')\\,.\\label{eq : enl}\\ ] ] the kernel can be expressed in terms of a universal kernel @xmath5 that depends on two dimensionless length scales @xmath6 and @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is a modulation of the local fermi vector @xmath10 that account for the local response . by depending on gradients as swell as local density , this local response reflects a broader dependence on the density variation through a plasmon - pole approximation.@xcite    the universal kernel @xmath11 kernel can also be tabulated in terms of @xmath12 and @xmath13 . fig .",
    "[ fig : kernel ] shows the kernel as a function of @xmath14 for three selected @xmath15 . the @xmath15 parameter is a measure of how different the local response of the two density regions are .",
    "the gga exchange energy can be expressed as a modulation @xmath16 of the lda exchange energy @xmath17 , as follows @xmath18 here @xmath19 is a measure of how rapidly the density is changing compared to length scale set by the local fermi wave vector . in the small @xmath20 limit , the modulations of the ggas go like @xmath21 , while in the large @xmath20 limit they differ significantly both quantitatively and qualitatively .",
    "because the nature of the adsorption systems considered here differ in a systematic manner , it becomes interesting to study how the predictions of vdw - df changes with correlation version and choice of exchange partner .",
    "for vdw - df1 correlation@xcite  ( the version of 2004 ) , we will in , in addition to the canonical choice of revpbe , use c09,@xcite pw86r,@xcite and optpbe@xcite as exchange partner .",
    "for vdw - df2 correlation,@xcite we use c09 , in addition to the canonical choice of pw86r .",
    "standard vdw - df1 with the revpbe  @xcite exchange functional as companion to its non - local correlation have shown an impressive robustness , giving good results for binding between molecules of various sizes and properties,@xcite adsorption onto insulating surfaces,@xcite graphene,@xcite and metals,@xcite and between various layered compounds.@xcite yet , its accuracy for sparse matter does not provide the full accuracy of traditional dft calculations for typical covalently bonded syste , where the generalized - gradient approximation excels . some of this inaccuracy can be attributed to the overly repulsive revpbe@xcite exchange functional causing overestimated separations .",
    "this exchange functional was chosen because many other standard choices like pbe  @xcite tend to produce spurious binding arising from exchange effects.@xcite    some sparse matter systems are also particularly challenging , like those with weak chemisorption .",
    "these systems are highly sensitive to the balance between the different terms in the exchange - correlation functional.@xcite the overestimation of binding separations in vdw - df can make it miss a van der waals - induced charge transfer , a signature of weak chemisorption .",
    "refinements of the vdw - df1 functional have been suggested , in particular it has been suggested to replace its exchange functional with a less repulsive one .",
    "cooper  @xcite designed an exchange functional c09 based on different fundamental constraints than revpbe , following the principles that underpins the introduction of the pbesol functional.@xcite c09 is less repulsive than revpbe , but becomes similar in the large @xmath20-limit , thereby minimizing contributions to unphyscial exchange binding .",
    "klime and coworkers@xcite reparameterized a set of exchange functionals by optimizing their performance to the s22 data set.@xcite one of these , the optpbe functional , corresponds to a reparameterization of pbe and is therefore somewhat similar to revpbe .",
    "this functional will be included in our study .",
    "recently , a new version of vdw - df called vdw - df2 has been developed.@xcite this functional sets the @xmath22 parameter by using a different description of the plasmon that is suggested by an analysis of the exchange - variation in the high - density limit.@xcite the updated plasmon description makes vdw - df2 less sensitive to low - density regions and generally reduces the non - local correlation energy .",
    "in addition to adjusting the version of correlation , this functional updates the account of exchange by relying on a refitted version of pw86 , here labeled pw86r.@xcite this exchange functional agree well with the exchange of hartre - fock calculations and avoids spurious exchange binding.@xcite this functional is also less repulsive than revpbe at binding separations .    in almost every case ,",
    "the modifications of vdw - df description reduces binding separations compared to the results of vdw - df1 . for the s22 data set,@xcite vdw - df1 with c09 exchange and vdw - df2 produces good results",
    "; unsurprisingly so does using vdw - df1 with optpbe , since it is was fitted to this data set . when comparing the versions for a broader class of systems , we find that no version clearly outperforms the others .",
    "to exemplify this observation , vdw - df2 stands out by predicting a potential energy curve for h@xmath1 on cu(111 ) that compares well with that generated from experimental data,@xcite both in terms of optimal separation and adsorption energy .",
    "however it underestimates the asymptotic form . for c60",
    "crystals,@xcite vdw - df1 predicts a cohesive energy 1.6  ev in good agreement with experimental measured interval 1.6 - 1.9 .",
    "vdw - df1 using c09 exchange functional predicts an excellent lattice constant and a cohesive energy of about 2  ev . in contrast",
    "vdw - df2 predicts a cohesive energy of merely 1.3  ev .",
    "for adsorption of c60 on au(111 ) , the combination of vdw - df2 and c09 has been found to yield the best results.@xcite for this system , neither vdw - df1 nor vdw - df2 are able to predict the right balance between repulsive and attractive terms that results in the experimental finding of a weak chemisorption.@xcite we find that vdw - df1 predicts the best binding energies for both benzene and c60 on graphene .",
    "bjrkman and coworkers recently asked the question `` are we van der waals ready ? '' in a large survey of the ability of electronic structure methods , including vdw - df1 and vdw - df2 , to accurately describe binding of layered systems.@xcite none of the dft functional methods they tested are able to consistently predict accurate binding energies , separations , and elastic constants .",
    "for instance both vdw - df1 and vdw - df2 in general overestimates interlayer separations .    to get a better understanding of why different functionals prevail for different systems , a more systematical analysis of their binding mechanisms are needed . a suggestion to test performance by comparing with experiments that reveal many interaction properties for the same one system",
    "was launched in refs .   here , we seek to map out how both the exchange and correlation functionals contribute to pecs for related molecules of different sizes and based on this analysis propose an additional adsorption - based strategy to refine functional testing . some of the analysis approaches taken here can be extended to other van der waals bonded systems , or directly applied to other non - local correlation functionals like those of vydrov and voorhis.@xcite      the vdw - df adsorption study presented here relies on a post - gga procedure similar to many previous vdw - df studies : the charge density is first generated in a self - consistent pbe calculation with ultrasoft pseudopotentials using the dacapo software package;@xcite next , in a post - processing procedure , we calculate the semi - local exchange at the gga level and non - local vdw - df correlation . these terms replace those of the self - consistent calculation .",
    "the non - local correlation part is calculated with an in - house real - space code presented and discussed in ref .  .",
    "this study is similar to previous vdw - df adsorption studies detailed in refs .   and resolves computational issues like grid sensitivity and handling of supercells in the same manner . here , the plane - wave cutoff is set to 500  ev and a @xmath23-sampling of @xmath24 is used .",
    "the supercell consists of @xmath25 graphene ( boron nitride ) primitive unit cells .",
    "this size makes inter - adsorbate interaction negligible even for the case of c60 adsorbates ( see lower left of fig .",
    "[ fig : ads_system ] ) , since the non - local interaction between adsorbates is explicitly corrected for .    it is useful to consider the part of the total energy in vdw - df that contains one - particle kinetic , electrostatic , local correlation , and exchange @xmath26 separately from the remaining non - local correlation @xmath27 . in a purely van der waals",
    "bonded system , the former part typically gives rise to a repulsive contribution to the potential energy curve  ( pec ) , while the non - local correlation part , an attractive .",
    "in calculating the contributions to the pec between a molecule and surface , we here calculate the former by subtracting off the energy off a reference system where the molecule is far from the surface @xmath28 in practice @xmath29   is sufficient . while for the contribution arising from non - local correlation , which have longer range , we subtract off the energy of isolated fragments@xcite @xmath30",
    "we describe the adsorption results of our vdw - df study of adsorption of benzene and c60 on graphene and boron nitride .",
    "we present the binding energies and sheet - to - molecule separation for the different systems and for the different functionals versions .",
    "we also calculate the dipole induced by adsorption and show that only c60-on - graphene induces a significant dipole at binding separations .      to determine the optimal site and corresponding binding energy and separation",

    "this occurs because the lda exchange ( as well as correlation ) part is inadequate for sparse matter;@xcite once replaced with a more sophisticated gga functional , most or all this exchange binding vanish .",

    "this small density overlap , even at such a short separation , gives a clear indication why it is futile to capture long van der waals interactions with local density functionals , in which the binding must be described alone by the local density magnitude .",
    "the presented lda analysis also indicates the problem of combining accounts of van der waals forces with gga exchange functionals that induce some exchange binding , in particular if fitting to unrepresentative training sets are used . for bigger systems , in the interface - normal direction , the balance between repulsive and attractive terms can be shifted because a gga exchange attraction only scales roughly with the size of the interface and it can not keep up with the increased non - local attraction .    we note that the popular pbe functional@xcite has a certain unphysical exchange attraction and that it is often used together with pair - potential accounts of van der waals forces .",

    "this similarity reflects the similar enhancement factors @xmath16 of revpbe and c09 in the large @xmath20-limit , as mentioned in section  [ sec : func_version ] .",
    "the optpbe curve has about the same depth as the c09 ( upper panel ) , but is less steep ( lower panel ) .",
    "hence the adsorption energy of vdw - df1(optpbe ) is similar to that of vdw - df1(c09 ) , while the optimal separation is larger .",
    "the revpbe , optpbe , and c09 curves have a positive value at a separation of 3.8   .",

    "this assumption is appropriate for weakly - bonded systems.@xcite if so , the total exchange - correlation contribution to the adsorption energy can be assessed if both the binding separation and energy is known .",
    "the separation also tells us how the exchange - correlation functional affects the steepness of the pec , since the van der waals forces must counter the kinetic - energy repulsion to make the molecule physisorb at a given separation .    _ the third step _ builds on the result that for molecules with similar interfaces to the surface ( or sheet ) like benzene and c60 , but with different geometries and size , we can single out the effect of van der waals forces ( fig .

    "one might drag molecules across the surface and measure the potential energy landscape,@xcite or observe the diffusion of molecules on the surface.@xcite based on diffusion barriers , corrugation can be estimated .",
    "many adsorption systems may have the structural relation as benzene and c60 on graphene and bn and that could make them good discriminators of exchange - correlation accounts .",
    "other experimental - systems , like scattering of light molecules on noble metal surfaces or systems with vacuum level shifts also provide excellent links between theory and experiment .",
    "as experimental methods continue to develop and new experimental data becomes available , these could be linked to dft calculations or parameterized in such a manner that it becomes straightforward to assess the performance of sparse matter methods . the construction of pec based on resonance levels of h@xmath1 backscattering@xcite makes it simple to assess the theoretical methods.@xcite the relation between corrugation and binding separation discussed in section  [ sec : corrugation ] provides a different example .    if we identify and organize several of these theory - experiment links for surfaces we can build up a database that could provide invaluable for the continued advancement of sparse - matter methods . today",
