    "in wave scattering , a conventional and well accepted notion is that weak scatterers lead to weak scattering .",
    "this can be understood by resorting to the born approximation .",

    "likewise , in the high energy ( short wavelength ) regime characterized by @xmath5 , the born approximation still holds in the weak scattering regime : @xmath6 . in general , whether scattering is weak or strong can be quantified by the scattering cross section . for scalar waves governed by the schrdinger equation , in the born regime",

    "the conventional understanding is then that a weak scatterer leads to a small cross section and , consequently , to weak scattering , and this holds regardless of nature of the scattering particle / wave , i.e. , vector , scalar or spinor .    in this paper , we report a counterintuitive phenomenon that defies the conventional wisdom that a weak scatterer always results in weak scattering .",
    "the phenomenon occurs in scattering of higher spinor waves , such as pseudospin-1 particles that can arise in experimental synthetic photonic systems whose energy band structure consists of a pair of dirac cones and a flat band through the conical intersection point  @xcite .",

    "in contrast , for a system hosting pseudospin-@xmath63 wave under the same condition of @xmath70 where the born approximation applies  @xcite , the maximum transport cross section is given by @xmath71 comparing with pseudospin-@xmath63 particles , the scattering behavior revealed by eq .",

    "the superscattering phenomenon uncovered in our work can in principle be tested experimentally in photonic lieb lattice systems through a particular design of the refractive index profile across the lattice to realize the scattering configuration .",
    "loading ultracold atoms into an optical lieb lattice fabricated by interfering counter - propagating laser beams  @xcite provides another versatile platform to test our findings , where appropriate holographic masks can be used to implement the desired scattering potential barrier  @xcite .",
    "synthetic photonic crystal based 2d pseudospin-@xmath18 wave systems are also promising for feasible experimental validation .",
    "for example , it was demonstrated experimentally  @xcite and theoretically  @xcite that a pseudospin-@xmath18 wave system can be realized in 2d dielectric photonic crystals via the principle of accidental degeneracy .",
    "implementation of the scalar type of potential can be achieved by manipulating the length scale of the photonic crystals . from a recent work of `` on - chip zero - index metamaterial '' design  @xcite based on such a system",
    ", we note that the phenomenon of superscattering uncovered in this paper can be relevant to a novel on - chip superscatterer fabrication , which is not possible for conventional wave systems .",
    "in conclusion , we uncover a superscattering phenomenon in a class of @xmath78d wave systems that host massless pseudospin-@xmath18 particles described by the dirac - weyl equation , where extraordinarily strong scattering ( characterized by an unusually large cross section ) occurs for arbitrarily weak scatterer in the low energy regime .",
    "physically , superscattering can be attributed to the emergence of persistent revival resonances for scatterers of weak strength , to which the cross section is inversely proportional .",
    "these unusual features defy the prediction of the born theory that is applicable but to conventional electronic or optical scattering systems .",
    "superscattering of pseudospin-@xmath18 wave thus represents a fundamentally new scattering scenario , and it is possible to conduct experimental test using synthetic photonic systems .    an important issue is whether superscattering uncovered in this paper is due to the presence of a flat band that implies an infinite density of states .",
    "our answer is negative , for the following reasons .",
    "note that , measured from the three - band intersection point , the energy for the ( dispersionless ) flat band states is zero outside and @xmath0 inside the scatterer , but for the two dispersion dirac bands the energy is finite outside the scatterer and not equal to @xmath0 inside . for elastic scattering considered in our work ,",
    "the incident energy outside the scatterer is finite and less than @xmath0 as well . as a result , only the states belonging to the conical dispersion bands are available both inside and outside the scatterer , and therefore are responsible for the superscattering phenomenon . indeed , as demonstrated , superscattering is due to revival resonant scattering for states belonging to the conical dispersion bands that persist in the regime of arbitrarily weak scatterer strength . from another angle ,",
    "if superscattering were due to the flat band , the phenomenon would arise in the conventional resonant scattering regime @xmath79 , which has never been observed .",
    "while the flat band itself is not directly relevant to the superscattering behavior , its presence makes the structure of the relevant states belonging to the conical bands different from those , e.g. , in a two band dirac cone system , giving rise to boundary conditions that permit discontinuities in the corresponding intensity distribution and tangent current at the interface .",
    "interestingly , surface plasmon modes [ c.f . , fig .",
    "[ fig : ssfig3](d ) ] are excited at the interface when revival resonant scattering occurs , which are strongly localized and can be excited for arbitrarily weak scatterer strength , leading to superscattering in the deep sub - wavelength regime .",
    "these modes are created from the particular spinor structure of the photon states , which can be implemented by engineering light propagation in periodically modulated / arranged , conventional dielectric materials ( e.g. , alumina ) rather than within the material itself .",
    "our finding of the superscattering phenomenon is thus striking and represents a new scattering capability that goes beyond the rayleigh - gans limit or , equivalently , one defined by the born approximation .",
    "with respect to potential applications of the finding of this paper , it is worth emphasizing that the phenomenon of superscattering represents a novel way of controlling light behaviors beyond those associated with the conventional scattering scenario because , in our system [ e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : band](b ) ] , light is structured into three - component spinor states and behaves as relativistic spin-1 wave in the underlying photonic lattice .",
    "there have been extensive recent experimental works demonstrating that such lattice systems can actually be realized .",
