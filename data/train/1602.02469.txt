    "the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) was initiated in 1984 primarily to provide a definitive answer to the solar neutrino problem  @xcite .",
    "ever since the pioneering calculations of solar neutrino fluxes by john bahcall and the pioneering measurements by ray davis in the 1960 s , it was known that there was a discrepancy between the observed fluxes and the calculations . the persistence of the problem motivated herb chen to contact canadian scientist cliff hargrove , a former colleague , to explore whether there was a possibility that enough heavy water could be made available on loan to perform a sensitive measurement and determine whether the neutrinos change their type in transit from the core of the sun .",
    "the unique properties of deuterium could make it possible to observe both the electron neutrinos produced in the core of the sun and the sum of all neutrino types  @xcite . with the immediate involvement of george ewan , who had been exploring underground sites for future experiments , a collaboration of 16 canadian and us scientists was formed in 1984 , led by chen and ewan as co - spokesmen  @xcite .",
    "uk scientists joined in 1985 , led by david sinclair as uk spokesman .",
    "an initial design was developed , to be sited 2 km underground in inco s creighton mine near sudbury , ontario , canada and preliminary approval was obtained from atomic energy of canada limited ( aecl ) for the loan of 1000 tonnes of heavy water .",
    "unfortunately herb chen passed away tragically from leukemia in 1987 .",
    "the collaboration continued with art mcdonald and gene beier as us spokesmen and grew with the addition of other institutions in the us and canada for a total of 13 institutions . in 1989 , funding was provided jointly by canadian , us and uk agencies and mcdonald became director of the project and the scientific collaboration .",

    "[ fig : flux ] ]    figure  [ fig : flux ] shows the fluxes of neutrinos from the pp chain reactions that comprise the principal power source in the sun  @xcite . overall the series of reactions can be summarized as : @xmath1 .",
    "also shown are the thresholds for neutrino detection for the chorine , gallium and h@xmath2o - based experiments that took place before the sno results were first reported in 2001 .",
    "these experiments were either exclusively ( chlorine , gallium ) or predominantly ( h@xmath2o ) sensitive to the electron - type neutrinos produced in the sun .",
    "they all showed deficits of factors of two to three compared to the fluxes illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : flux ] .",
    "it was not possible , however , for these experiments to show conclusively that this was due to neutrino flavor change rather than defects in the solar flux calculations . with heavy water containing deuterium ( d@xmath2o )",
    ", the sno experiment was able to measure two separate reactions on deuteron ( d ) :    1 .",
    "@xmath3 , a charged current ( cc ) reaction that was sensitive only to electron - flavor neutrinos , and 2 .",
    "@xmath4 a neutral current ( nc ) reaction that was equally sensitive to all neutrino types .    a significant deficit in the @xmath0b @xmath5 flux measured by the cc reaction over that measured by the nc reaction",
    "would directly demonstrate that the sun s electron neutrinos were changing to one of the other two types , without reference to solar models . at the same time , the nc reaction provided a measurement of the total flux of @xmath6 solar neutrinos independent of neutrino flavor change .",
    "the cc reaction was detected by observing the cone of cherenkov light produced by the fast moving electron .",
    "the nc reaction was detected in three different ways in the three phases of the project . in phase",
    "i , with pure heavy water in the detector , the nc reaction was observed via cherenkov light from conversion of the 6.25-mev @xmath7  ray produced when the free neutron captured on deuterium . in phase ii , with nacl dissolved in the heavy water , the neutrons produced via the nc reaction captured predominantly on chlorine , resulting in a cascade of @xmath7  rays with energy totaling 8.6 mev and producing a very isotropic distribution of light in the detector .",
    "the capture efficiency was increased significantly during phase ii and the isotropy enabled a separation of events from the two reactions on a statistical basis . in phase iii , the nc neutrons were detected in an array of @xmath8-filled neutron counters .",
    "in addition , the sno detector could observe neutrinos of all flavors via the elastic scattering ( es ) of electrons by neutrinos :    1 .",
    "@xmath9 which is six times more sensitive to electron neutrinos than other flavors .",
    "this is the same reaction used by the kamiokande - ii and super - kamiokande experiments to observe solar neutrinos using light water as a medium .",
    "figure  [ fig : schematic ] is a schematic diagram of the sno detector  @xcite .",
    "the cavity was 34 meters high by 22 meters in diameter at the equator , lined with a water- and radon - impermeable urylon plastic .",
    "the detector was situated 2 km underground in an active nickel mine owned by vale ( formerly inco ltd ) near sudbury , ontario .",
    "the central element was 1000 tonnes of heavy water ( @xmath10 isotopically pure ) , on loan from aecl and housed in a transparent acrylic vessel ( av ) 12 meters in diameter and 5 cm thick .",
    "the value of the heavy water was about $ 300 million canadian dollars .",
    "the heavy water was viewed by 9438 20-cm diameter hamamatsu r1408 photomultiplier tubes ( pmt ) mounted on a stainless steel geodesic photomultiplier support frame ( psup ) .",
    "each pmt had a 27-cm entrance light concentrator to increase the effective photocathode coverage to 54% .",
    "a further 91 pmts without concentrators were mounted looking outward from the psup to observe events entering the detector from the outside .",
    "the entire cavity outside the acrylic vessel was filled with 7000 tonnes of ultra - pure ordinary water .    ]",
    "the construction sequence involved the building of the upper half of the geodesic structure for the pmts , installing them and lifting it with a movable platform into place .",
    "this was followed by the construction of the upper half of the acrylic vessel , which was a major process , involving the bonding together of the first half of the 122 panels that were smaller than the maximum length of 3.9 meters that could fit within the mine hoist cage .",
    "the platform was then moved down by stages with the lower half of the acrylic vessel and the pmt structure added sequentially .",
    "calibration was accomplished using a set of specialized sources that could be placed on the central axis or on two orthogonal planes off - axis in locations that covered more than 70% of the detector .",
    "these sources included 6.13-mev @xmath7  rays triggered from decays of @xmath11  @xcite , a source of @xmath12  @xcite , encapsulated sources of u , th , a @xmath13 fission neutron source , 19.8-mev @xmath7  rays from the t(p,@xmath7 ) reaction generated by a small accelerator suspended on the central axis  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11 and @xmath12 were produced by a d(t , n ) neutron source generated by a small accelerator in a location near the sno detector and transported by capillary tubes to the main heavy water volume .",
    "signals from the sno pmts were received by electronics that made four different measurements . for all pmt signals that were above a threshold of the equivalent of 1/4 of a photoelectron of charge ,",
    "the electronics recorded a time relative to a global trigger , and provided three different charge measurements : a short - window ( 60  ns ) integration of the pmt pulse , a long - window ( @xmath14 400  ns ) integration , and a low - gain version of the long - integration charge .",
    "each pmt above 1/4  pe also provided a 93 ns - wide analog trigger signal and signals across the entire detector were summed together .",
    "an event was triggered if that sum exceeded a pre - set threshold , representing a number of pmts firing in coincidence .",
    "the system also kept absolute time according to a gps clock signal that was sent underground .",
    "an accurate determination of the total solar neutrino flux required a detector with ultra - low levels of any radioactive sources capable of mimicking the signal .",
    "in addition , the residual levels needed to be determined with sufficient accuracy that they contribute only slightly to the overall measurement uncertainties .",
    "of particular concern for sno were two high - energy @xmath7  rays produced in the @xmath15 and @xmath16 chains ( of energy 2615 and 2447  kev , respectively ) .",
    "these were above the deuteron photo - disintegration threshold and hence produce neutrons indistinguishable from neutrino induced events . as a consequence , all the materials used in the fabrication of the detector were carefully screened for radioactivity and the collaboration worked with manufacturers to develop techniques to produce radioactively pure materials and components .    to achieve this level of radiopurity in the water , both the light and heavy water in sno were purified through numerous stages including filtration , degassing , customized ion - exchange and reverse osmosis .",
    "the h@xmath2o  and d@xmath2o  purification plants were designed to remove rn , ra , th and pb from the water , thereby eliminating sources giving rise to the high energy @xmath7  rays .",
    "two of the main elements of the sno h@xmath2o  and d@xmath2o  purification plants consisted of newly developed ion - exchange processes using mnox  @xcite and htio  @xcite , which targeted ra , th , and pb nuclei in the water . with the removal of these elements ,",
    "secular equilibrium was broken and the short lived daughters quickly decayed away .",
    "the htio and mnox techniques developed by sno were also used to assay the amount of residual activity remaining in the fluids . in the case of htio ,",
    "the activity was eluted from htio by strong acids and concentrated into liquid scintillator vials for counting .",
    "the technique developed for mnox used electrostatic counters to measure the @xmath17 and @xmath18 emanating from the surface .",
    "radon gas was particularly problematic as it emanated from materials and could migrate or diffuse into sensitive areas of the detector .",
    "large process degassers and membrane contactors were used to strip radon from the water with high efficiency .",
    "monitoring degassers were used to collect radon from the water into lucas cells for a determination of the residual contamination .",
    "the design of the purification systems was to achieve a rate of photo - disintegration events created by impurities of less than 10% of the nc rate predicted by the standard solar model . to achieve this in the d@xmath2o  system required an equivalent of @xmath19d@xmath2o  and @xmath20d@xmath2o .",
    "the requirements for the h@xmath2o  outside the main detector were not as stringent , and were @xmath21h@xmath2o  and @xmath22h@xmath2o . measurements of the water purity throughout the experiment showed that the levels for u in both d@xmath2o   and h@xmath2o , and th in d@xmath2o  were consistently better than the design value , while the th content in h@xmath2o  was about at the target level .",
    "hence the background contamination rate was not significant in comparison to the neutrino nc signal .",
    "the assay measurements were consistent between htio , mnox and radon gas measurements , and agreed with _ in - situ _ measurements made with the pmt array .",
    "sno s first measurements of the rates of cc and nc reactions on deuterium by @xmath0b solar neutrinos used unadulterated d@xmath2o in the detector .",
    "the measurements had several challenges that differed from the following two phases of the experiment .",
    "the first was that the number of detected events expected from the nc reaction was low , in part because the neutron capture cross section on deuterium is small , but also because the energy of the @xmath7  ray released in that capture was just 6.25  mev , near sno s anticipated energy threshold .",
    "the phase - i data analysis was also the first to face unexpectedly large instrumental backgrounds , which had to be removed before more detailed analyses could proceed .",
    "the primary result from phase i was a rejection of the null hypothesis that solar neutrinos do not change flavor by comparing the flux measured by the cc reaction to those by both nc and es reactions .    in sno phase",
    "i , the signals from the es , cc , and nc reactions could not be separated on an event - by - event basis . instead",
    ", a fit to the data set was performed for each signal amplitude , using the fact that they are distributed distinctly in the following three derived quantities : the effective kinetic energy @xmath23 of the @xmath7 ray resulting from the capture of a neutron produced by the nc reaction or of the recoil electron from the cc or es reactions , the reconstructed radial position of the interaction ( @xmath24 ) and the reconstructed direction of the event relative to the expected direction of a neutrino arriving from the sun ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the reconstructed radial positions @xmath24 were measured in units of av radii and weighted by volume , so that @xmath26 when an event reconstructs at the edge of the d@xmath2o  volume .",
    "is the effective kinetic energy of the @xmath7 from neutron capture or of the electron from the es or cc reactions , and @xmath27 is the reconstructed event radius , volume - weighted to the 600  cm radius of the acrylic vessel .",
    "[ fig : pdfs ] ]    figure  [ fig : pdfs ] shows the simulated distributions for each of the signals .",
    "the nine distributions were used as probability density functions ( pdfs ) in a generalized maximum likelihood fit of the solar neutrino data .",
    "the top row shows the @xmath23  distribution for each of the three signals .",
    "the cc and es reactions both reflect the @xmath0b spectrum of incident neutrinos , with es having a much softer spectrum due to the kinematics of the reaction .",
    "the nc reaction is essentially a line spectrum , because neutron capture on deuterium always results in the same 6.25-mev @xmath7  ray .",
    "the @xmath28 distributions are shown in the middle row of fig .",
    "[ fig : pdfs ] .",
    "electrons from the cc reaction are distributed only within the heavy water volume , while those from es extend into the light water .",
    "the neutrons from the nc reaction fall nearly linearly in @xmath28 from the center of the heavy water to the edge , because of the probability of exiting the heavy water volume and being captured on light water ( and thus being below the detection threshold ) .",
    "the bottom row of fig .",
    "[ fig : pdfs ] shows the @xmath29 distribution of the events .",
    "the es reaction has a prominent peak indicating the solar origin for the neutrinos .",
    "the cc electrons have a softer but nonetheless distinctive @xmath14 @xmath30 distribution , while the nc neutrons have no correlation at all with the solar direction .",
    "the phase - i data set was acquired between november 2 , 1999 and may 31 , 2001 , and represented a total of 306.4 live days .",
    "the sno detector responded to several triggers , the primary one being a coincidence of 18 or more pmts firing within a period of 93  ns ( the threshold was lowered to 16 or more pmts after december 20 , 2000 ) .",
    "the rate of such triggers averaged roughly 5  hz . a `` random '' trigger also pulsed the detector at 5  hz throughout the data acquisition period .    to provide a final check against statistical bias , the data set was divided in two : an `` open '' data set to which all analysis procedures and methods were applied , and a `` blind '' data set upon which no analysis within the signal region ( between 40 and 200 hit pmts ) was performed until the full analysis program had been finalized .",
    "the blind data set began at the end of june 2000 , at which point only 10% of the data",
    "set was being analyzed , leaving the remaining 90% blind .",
    "the total size of the blind data set thus corresponded to roughly 30% of the total live time .",
    "the presence of many sources of events created by the instrumentation of the sno detector was apparent even before the start of heavy water running .",
    "the approach to removing these events began with a suite of simple cuts to act as a series of `` coarse filters , '' removing the most obvious of such events , before any event reconstruction .",
    "sources of instrumental events included light generated by the pmts ( `` flasher pmts '' ) that happened for every pmt and occurred at a rate of roughly 1/minute ; light from occasional high - voltage breakdown in the pmt connector or base ; light generated by static discharge in the neck of the vessel ; electronic pickup ; and isotropic light occasionally emitted by the acrylic vessel .",
    "the cuts were based only on simple low - level information such as pmt charges and times , but the full suite removed the vast majority of the instrumental events .",
    "two independent suites were created to help validate the overall performance of the coarse filters .",
    "the acceptance for signal events of the instrumental background cuts was measured using calibration source data , and was found to be @xmath3199.5% .",
    "the reconstruction of event position , direction , and energy was performed on events that passed the instrumental background cuts .",
    "position reconstruction used the relative pmt - hit times as well as the angular distribution of photon hits about a hypothesized event direction .",
    "event energy used the number of pmt hits along with an analytic model of the detector response to cherenkov light that was a function of event position and direction . for both position and energy , additional independent algorithms were used to validate the results  @xcite .",
    "after reconstruction , a further set of cuts were applied to remove events that were not consistent with the timing and angular distribution of cherenkov light ( `` cherenkov box cuts '' ) .",
    "the two cuts that defined the cherenkov box were the width of the prompt timing peak of the pmt hits , and the average angle between pairs of hit pmts .",
    "neutrons and events from spallation products that were created by the passage of muons or the interactions of atmospheric neutrinos were removed by imposing a 20-s veto window following the muon events , and a 250-ms veto following any event that produced more than 60 fired pmts ( roughly 7 mev of electron - equivalent total energy @xmath32 ) .",
    "the final set of cuts were the requirement that events have a reconstructed effective kinetic energy @xmath33  mev , and a reconstructed position with @xmath34  cm ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "for sno phase i to be able to make a measurement of the total flux of neutrinos via the nc reaction , it was critical that the number of background neutrons was small compared to those expected from solar neutrinos .",
    "the most dangerous source of such neutrons was those from the photodisintegration of deuterons by @xmath7  rays , resulting from decays in the @xmath36u and @xmath37th chains .",
    "the levels of u and th were measured in two ways : _ ex situ _ assays of the heavy and light water  @xcite , and _ in situ _ measurements of @xmath38tl and @xmath39bi concentrations using the differences in the isotropy of their cherenkov - light distributions .",
    "both methods agreed well , and by combining them the levels of u and th in the heavy water were found to be : @xmath40    with these measurements , and those of radioactivity in the light water and acrylic vessel , the total number of background neutrons from photodisintegration in the phase - i data set was 38.2@xmath41 from the @xmath37th chain and 33.1@xmath42 from @xmath36u chain .",
    "neutrons from other sources , such as atmospheric neutrinos and @xmath43 processes , were found to be just @xmath44  counts .    the pdfs shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdfs ] were created via a calibrated and over - constrained monte carlo simulation .",
    "events resulting from @xmath0b neutrino interactions or sources of background were passed through a detector model that included the propagation of electrons , @xmath7  rays , and neutrons through the heavy water , a detailed optical response of the detector media and pmts , and data acquisition electronics .",
    "parameters such as optical attenuation lengths , scattering , and overall pmt collection efficiency were measured by deploying a diffuse laser source  @xcite and a @xmath45n source  @xcite of 6.1-mev @xmath7  rays throughout the detector volume .",
    "residual differences between the model prediction for energy scale , energy resolution , vertex reconstruction bias and vertex resolution , were taken as systematic uncertainties on the model , and were within @xmath46 1% .",
    "the overall neutron capture efficiency was measured using the deployment of a @xmath47cf source throughout the detector volume .",
    "the fit to the data set using the pdfs of fig .",
    "[ fig : pdfs ] was done via an extended log - likelihood of the form : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the number of events of type @xmath50 ( e.g. cc , es , or nc ) , @xmath51 is a sum over all three - dimensional bins in the three signal extraction parameters @xmath23 , @xmath28 , and @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is the number of detected events in each bin .",
    "the numbers of cc , es , and nc events were treated as free parameters in the fit .",
    "the likelihood function was maximized over the free parameters , and the best fit point yielded the number of cc , es , and nc events along with a covariance matrix .",
    "the phase - i data set was fit under two different assumptions .",
    "the first was that the recoil electron spectra of the cc and es events resulted from an undistorted @xmath0b neutrino spectrum , thus testing the null hypothesis that solar neutrinos do not change flavor .",
    "the second fit had no such constraint , and could be done either by fitting events bin - by - bin in energy  @xcite or by using only @xmath28 and @xmath54  @xcite .",
    "in addition to fitting for the three signal rates ( cc , es , and nc ) , the sno data also allowed a direct fit for the neutrino flavor content through a change of variables : @xmath55 the factor of 0.1559 is the ratio of the es cross sections for @xmath56 and @xmath57 above @xmath58  mev . making this change of variables and fitting directly for the flavor content",
    ", the null hypothesis test of no flavor change is reduced to a test of @xmath59 .",
    "conversion of event numbers from the fit into neutrino fluxes required corrections for cut acceptance , live time , measured neutron capture efficiency , subtraction of neutron backgrounds , and effects not included in the monte carlo simulation ( such as the eccentricity of the earth s orbit ) . with these corrections applied , and measurements of the systematic uncertainties on both acceptances and detector response , the flux values for the constrained fit are  ( in units of @xmath60 ) :    @xmath61 + @xmath62 + @xmath63 +    the physical interpretation of the `` flux '' for each interaction type is that it is the equivalent flux of @xmath0b @xmath57s produced from an undistorted energy spectrum that would yield the same number of events inside the signal region from that interaction as was seen in the data set .",
