    "in statistical mechanics the thermodynamic functions are given in terms of the logarithm of the partition function and its derivatives with respect to volume , temperature , etc .",
    "the mathematical expression of the canonical partition function is an infinite sum over all the states of the system or , under some simplifying assumptions , the states of the individual particles.@xcite some of these infinite sums are commonly calculated approximately by means of the euler - maclaurin summation formula@xcite and most textbooks simply show how to apply it to the cases of interest.@xcite a rigorous derivation of the summation formula may be rather too demanding for inexperienced students and one avoids it in introductory courses on statistical thermodynamics or statistical mechanics .",
    "there is a relatively simple way of deriving the summation formula by means of operator methods@xcite but it also requires some kind of mathematical expertise that students of introductory courses may not posses .",
    "however , the students may feel more confident and confortable if they are shown how to carry out such calculations by means of mathematical methods that they have already learned in a first course on mathematical analysis .    in an introductory undergraduate course",
    "we show how to obtain the first two terms of the euler - maclaurin summation formula in an extremely simple way that only requires the students to be familiar with the taylor expansion .",
    "the aim of this paper is to put forward this approach that we deem suitable for pedagogical purposes . in section  [ sec : simple_appro ]",
    "we outline the method and apply it to some simple examples in section  [ sec : examples ] .",
    "if we decide to show the students how to obtain terms of higher order this simple approach results to be rather cumbersome .",
    "for that reason , in section  [ sec : systematic ] we show how to derive the full summation formula by a relatively minor change of strategy that requires some additional mathematical skills .",
    "the reader may choose one or another approach depending on the level of the course .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize the results and draw conclusions .",
    "the simplest canonical partition functions in statistical mechanics can be expressed as sums of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 should tend to zero sufficiently fast when @xmath2 because , otherwise , the sum does not converge . in most cases",
    "one can not obtain this sum in closed form and therefore resorts to some kind of approximation valid under certain conditions ; for example , sufficiently high temperature . in order to derive such an approach",
    "we define @xmath3 that satisfies @xmath4 and @xmath5    substituting the taylor expansion @xmath6 for @xmath7 into ( [ eq : s(x)_prop2 ] )    we obtain , after some rearrangement , @xmath8 if we integrate this expression between @xmath9 and @xmath10 and take into account that @xmath11 and all its derivatives vanish at the upper limit we have @xmath12 that can be solved iteratively . in the first step",
    "we omit the derivatives of @xmath11 so that this function is approximately given by @xmath11 @xmath13 .",
    "if we substitute this approximate result into the right - hand side of ( [ eq : s(x)_iter ] ) we have @xmath14 thus , for @xmath15 we obtain a simple approximation to the sum ( [ eq : s ] ) : @xmath16    the simple method just outlined is suitable for introductory courses because it only requires basic knowlegde in mathematical analysis .",
    "this procedure is not suitable for the systematic calculation of the corrections of higher order to the basic formula ( [ eq : s_approx_simp ] ) because it soon becomes rather cumbersome .",
    "however , this result is suitable for most porposes in an introductory course on statistical mechanics because several partitions functions for atomic and simple molecular systems can be easily derived from it.@xcite",
    "under some simplifying assumptions that we will not discuss in this paper statistical mechanics tell us how to express the thermodynamic functions of atomic and molecular systems in terms of one - particle partition functions of the form@xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the volume of the container , @xmath19 the absolute temperature , @xmath20 the @xmath21-th energy level ( assumed to be @xmath22-fold degenerate ) of the particle and @xmath23 the boltzman constant .",
    "let us first consider a particle of mass @xmath24 in a one - dimensional box of length @xmath25 with impenetrable walls which is the starting point for the calculation of the thermodynamic properties of an ideal monoatomic gas.@xcite if the particle has no internal structure its spectrum is only given by the translational degree of freedom : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the planck constant @xmath28 divided @xmath29 and @xmath30 . upon defining @xmath31 @xmath32",
    "the partition function @xmath33 reads @xmath34 and the approximation ( [ eq : s_approx_simp ] ) yields @xmath35 this approximate expression is accurate for sufficiently small values of @xmath36 or , equivalently , when the thermal de broglie wavelength @xmath37 is much smaller than the box length @xmath25.@xcite the addition of corrections of higher order commonly improves the result of the approximate partition function , but in this case all of them vanish.@xcite figure  [ fig : pb ] shows that this approximate expression becomes increasingly more accurate as @xmath36 decreases .    the spectrum of a one - dimensional harmonic oscillator is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the frequency of the oscillation and @xmath30 .",
    "the partition function for this degree of freedom is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "in this case the sum @xmath42 is a geometric series that can be calculated exactly and therefore we can derive its small-@xmath36 expansion in a straightforward way : @xmath43 if we define the vibrational temperature @xmath44 then @xmath45 and the euler - maclaurin formula is a good approximation when @xmath46 . the approximate expression ( [ eq : s_approx_simp ] )",
    "yields the first two terms of this series exactly .",
    "the last example is the partition function for a rigid rotor with moment of inertia @xmath47 . in this case , every energy level @xmath48 is @xmath49-fold degenerate and the partition function for the rotational degree of freedom is given by @xmath50 where @xmath51",
    ". the approximate expression ( [ eq : s_approx_simp ] ) yields @xmath52 that is accurate enough if @xmath36 is sufficently small as shown in figure  [ fig : rr ] .",
    "it is custommary to define the rotational temperature @xmath53@xcite so that @xmath54 when @xmath55 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the @xmath36-independent term in equation ( [ eq : s_rr_appro1 ] ) is not exact as shown in the following section .",
    "if we decide to show the students how to obtain expression of higher order it is convenient to proceed in a different way .",
    "if we write the taylor expansion discussed in section  [ sec : simple_appro ] as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the @xmath58-th derivative of @xmath11 with respect to @xmath9 , then equation ( [ eq : s(x)_iter ] ) reads @xmath59 where @xmath60 .    instead of trying to solve equation ( [ eq : s(x)_iter2 ] ) iteratively",
    "we propose a solution of the form @xmath61 where @xmath62 . in order to obtain the coefficients",
    "@xmath63 we substitute ( [ eq : s(x)_ansatz ] ) into ( [ eq : s(x)_iter2 ] ) and compare the coefficients of @xmath64 in the left- and right - hand sides ; the result is @xmath65 we thus have @xmath66 and @xmath67    straightforward inspection of the first coefficients @xmath68 @xmath69 suggests that @xmath70 vanish for all @xmath71 . in order to prove this conjecture we consider the function @xmath72 that satisfies @xmath73 if we substitute the taylor expansion @xmath74 into equation ( [ eq : u(x)-u(-x ) ] ) we conclude that @xmath75 for all @xmath71 . if we now expand @xmath76 in a taylor series about @xmath15 and compare the coefficients of @xmath77 in the left- and right - hand sides of the resulting equation we obtain a recurrence relation for the coefficients @xmath78 that is identical with equation ( [ eq : a_n_rec ] ) for the coefficients @xmath68 .",
    "we thus conclude that @xmath79 for all @xmath21",
    ". therefore , equation ( [ eq : s_appro_gen1 ] ) reduces to @xmath80 it is worth noting that the coefficients @xmath81 are related to the brillouin numbers @xmath82@xcite in the following way : @xmath83 .",
    "the operator method leads to this result in a more straightforward way and is also more convenient for the discussion of the radius of convergence of the series.@xcite however , we do not discuss it here because it requires the introduction of functions of operators that may not be suitable for an undergraduate course .",
    "let us apply this more accurate approach to the examples discussed in section  [ sec : examples ] .",
    "as pointed out in that section nothing can be done with the particle in a box because all the corrections of higher order vanish .",
    "this surprising result can be explained very easily and applies to all the sums in which @xmath84 because @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "a more rigorous analysis of such problems , based on the poisson summation formula , can be found eslewhere.@xcite    the harmonic oscillator is a suitable simple example for testing the summation formula ( [ eq : s_appro_gen2 ] ) because we can calculate the exact expansion as shown in equation ( [ eq : s_exact_exp ] ) . in this case",
    "every new term added to the summation formula ( [ eq : s_appro_gen2 ] ) yields one more term of the small-@xmath36 series ( [ eq : s_exact_exp ] ) as one may easily verify .",
    "the application of the summation formula ( [ eq : s_appro_gen2 ] ) to the partition function for the rigid rotor should be carried out with care .",
    "the reason is that @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is a polynomial function of @xmath36 of degree @xmath89 and @xmath90",
    ". therefore , the summation formula that includes all the terms through @xmath91 only yields the small-@xmath36 series correctly through degree @xmath92 . for this reason the simple expression ( [ eq : s_approx_simp ] ) does not yield the correct @xmath36-independent term that receives contributions from @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the expansion accurate to @xmath95 is easily shown to be @xmath96 if we add all the terms trough @xmath97 in the summation formula ( [ eq : s_appro_gen2 ] ) as argued above . since",
    "this series does not converge@xcite one should truncate it before the terms start to increase .",
    "as stated in the introduction we show the students the simple method developed in section  [ sec : simple_appro ] because it is sufficient for the purposes of our course .",
    "however , if a motivated student wants to learn how to obtain the corrections of greater order that appear in some of the available texbooks on statistical mechanics then one can suggest him or her to try the systematic approach of section  [ sec : systematic ] or even the operator method.@xcite in our opinion the present way of deriving the euler - maclaurin summation formula for statistical mechanics applications is more convenient for pedagogical purposes than the traditional one that appears in most textbooks on mathematics or numerical analysis.@xcite such traditional approaches are certainly more rigorous and general but require the students to be more experienced in mathematics .    in passing ,",
    "it is worth mentioning that the summation formula given by equations ( [ eq : a_n_rec ] ) and  ( [ eq : s_appro_gen2 ] ) is suitable for motivating the students to resort to a computer algebra system . in this way they bypass the tedious algebraic manipulation of the equations that is necessary for the calculation of contributions of large order like those in equation ( [ eq : s_rr_em ] ) and practise programming in any of such useful languages ."
