    "superradiance of an ensemble of dipoles confined within a limited region in space has been discovered in the pioneering work by dicke.@xcite the underlying physical mechanism can be described as follows .",
    "suppose that a large number , @xmath0 , of dipoles with frequency @xmath1 are confined in a volume with characteristic size @xmath2 much smaller than the radiation wavelength @xmath3 .",
    "then radiation of an ensemble is a cooperative process in which the emission of a photon is accompanied by virtual photon exchange between individual emitters .",
    "this near field radiative coupling between the dipoles leads to formation of new system eigenstates , each comprised of all individual dipoles .",
    "the eigenstates with angular momentum @xmath4 are _ superradiant _ , i.e. , their radiative lifetimes are very short , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is radiative lifetime of an individual dipole ; the remaining states are _ subradiant _ with much longer decay times , @xmath7 .    since the appearance of dicke paper , cooperative effects based on dicke radiative coupling mechanism",
    "have been extensively studied in atomic and semiconductor systems ( see , e.g. , reviews in refs . ) .",
    "two different decay times corresponding to superradiant and subradiant states were observed in a system of two laser - trapped ions @xcite and , more recently , in laterally arranged quantum dots.@xcite other examples of cooperative behavior analogous to the dicke effect include , e.g. , electron tunneling through a system of quantum dots @xcite and spontaneous phonon emission by coupled quantum dots .",
    "@xcite    recently , we extended the dicke effect to plasmonic systems comprised of @xmath0 dipoles located in the vicinity of a metal nanostructure , e.g. , metal nanoparticle ( np ) , supporting localized surface plasmon ( sp).@xcite in such systems , the dominant coupling mechanism between dipoles is _ plasmonic _ rather than radiative , i.e. , it is based on virtual plasmon exchange ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dicke ] ) .",
    "this plasmonic coupling leads to formation of collective states , similar to dicke superradiant states , which dominate photon emission .",
    "furthermore , the nanostructure acts as a hub that couples nearby and remote dipoles with about equal strength and hence provides a more efficient hybridization of dipoles compared to radiative coupling . in general , as dipoles orientations in space are non - uniform , there are three superradiant states with total angular momentum @xmath4 , each having radiative decay rate @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is radiative decay rate of a _ single _ dipole near a nanostructure ( i.e. , _ with _ plasmon enhancement).@xcite     ( color online ) radiative coupling of emitters in free space ( a ) , and plasmonic coupling of emitters near a metal nanoparticle ( b ) . ]",
    "the principal difference between plasmonic and usual ( photonic ) dicke effects stems from non - radiative energy transfer between the dipoles and the nanostructure .",
    "let us first outline its role for the case of a _ single _ dipole near metal np . when an excited emitter is located close to metal surface , its energy can be transferred to optically inactive excitations in the metal and eventually dissipated ( ohmic losses ) .",
    "this is described by the _ non - radiative decay _",
    "rate , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the dipole  surface separation.@xcite note that very close to metal surface ( @xmath12 nm ) , this dependence changes to @xmath13 due to surface - assisted generation of electron - hole pairs out of the fermi sea.@xcite as a result , the radiation of a coupled dipole - np system is governed by a competition between non - radiative losses and plasmon enhancement@xcite that determines system quantum efficiency , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the _ full _ decay rate .",
    "indeed , the radiated energy is @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 being wave vector and speed of light , and its distance dependence follows that of @xmath19 .",
    "namely , with decreasing @xmath11 , the emission first increases due to plasmon enhancement , and then , at several nm from metal surface , it is quenched due to suppression of @xmath19 by non - radiative losses . both enhancement and quenching",
    "were observed in recent experiments on fluorescing molecules attached to a metal np,@xcite and , not too close to np surface , the distance dependence of _ single - molecule _",
    "fluorescence @xcite was found in excellent agreement with single dipole - np models.@xcite    when radiation takes place from an _ ensemble _ of emitters near a metal nanostructure , there are _ two _ distinct types of plasmon - induced couplings between the emitters .",
    "the first is _ plasmon - enhanced radiative coupling _ , described by radiative decay matrix @xmath20 , where indexes @xmath21",
    "refer to emitters , that is a straightforward extension of dicke radiative coupling obtained by incorporating sp local field into the common radiation field .",
    "correspondingly , the eigenstates of @xmath20 are superradiant and subradiant states characterized by the strength of their coupling to radiation field . in the ideal case of `` point sample , ''",
    "i.e. , @xmath22 , the subradiant decay rates are negligibly small and @xmath20 essentially has just three non - zero eigenvalues , corresponding to superradiant decay rates , each scaling with @xmath0 as @xmath8.@xcite    the second coupling mechanism is _ non - radiative energy transfer _ between dipoles that takes place in two steps : an excited dipole first transfers its energy to plasmons in nanostructure via its electric field , and then this energy is transferred to another dipole .",
    "this process involves plasmons with _ all _ angular momenta @xmath23 , and it is described by non - radiative decay matrix , @xmath24 .",
    "importantly , plasmons with @xmath25 couple to _ both _ superradiant and subradiant states , so that the eigenstates of _ full decay matrix _",
    ", @xmath26 , are not superradiant and subradiant states , but their admixtures .",
    "close to metal surface where non - radiative processes are dominant , @xmath24 prevails over @xmath20 , and no cooperative behavior is expected .",
    "however , when dipoles are removed from the surface by more than several nm , the energy transfer occurs primarily via optically active dipole surface sp and therefore no significant mixing of superradiant and subradiant states takes place and superradiance is intact .",
    "this observation was confirmed by numerical calculation of eigenvalues of @xmath27 , i.e. , full decay rates of system eigenstates , for ensemble of @xmath0 dipoles randomly distributed in a solid angle around a np.@xcite namely , in a wide range of dipole - np distances , three eigenvalues corresponding to superradiant states are well separated from the rest and scale with @xmath0 according to @xmath28 .",
    "since the superradiant states are the optically active ones with radiative decay rate also scaling as @xmath8 , their quantum efficiencies essentially _ coincide _ with @xmath19 of single dipole - np system .",
    "therefore , in the cooperative regime , the ensemble quantum efficiency , @xmath29 , is thrice that of the single dipole - np system , @xmath30 regardless of the ensemble size .",
    "thus , the total radiated energy of the ensemble , @xmath31 , is reduced to just @xmath32 .",
    "the remaining energy is trapped by @xmath33 subradiant states and eventually dissipated in the metal rather than being emitted with a much slower rate , as it would be the case in free space .",
    "on the other hand , at several nm from metal surface , the non - radiative coupling is dominated by higher @xmath23 plasmons causing strong mixing of superradiant and subradiant states , i.e. , all system eigenstates have comparable quantum efficiencies and @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , with increasing distance , @xmath29 , should first exhibit a sharp rise with its slope @xmath35 , and then switch to a more slower @xmath36 dependence .",
    "indications of such behavior were reported in the recent experiment by dulkeith _",
    "et al._,@xcite where a systematic study of the ensemble fluorescence vs. distance to metal surface was performed for cy5 fluorophores attached to au np in water .",
    "the distance was controlled by varying fluorophores concentration ; with increasing concentration , the linker molecules stretched outwards to accommodate repulsive dipole - dipole interaction between fluorophores .",
    "therefore , within isolated dipole - np picture , one would expect that for larger distances , at which fluorophores concentration was higher than average , the measured quantum efficiency , normalized to some average fluorophores number , should have exceeded the calculated efficiency in single dipole - np models.@xcite instead , with increasing distance , the normalized @xmath19 , exhibited rapid saturation and , at large distances , was considerably smaller in magnitude than the calculated one .    in the above discussion , we completely ignored interactions between the dipoles .",
    "in fact , the role of dipole - dipole interactions in cooperative emission is highly non - trivial since they introduce a disorder into the energy spectrum by causing frequency shifts among randomly distributed in space but otherwise identical emitters.@xcite mesoscopic cooperative emission from a disordered system , i.e. , for particular disorder realizations rather than its averaged effect , was considered in ref .",
    "( see also ref .  ) .",
    "it was found that frequency shifts due to dipole - dipole interactions lift the degeneracy of subradiant states without having significant impact on superradiant states .",
    "it was also shown that interactions between collective eigenstates are much weaker than those between individual dipoles , including typical nearest neighbors ( i.e. , separated by @xmath37 ) , due to cancellations between dipole - dipole terms among individual pairs with their constituents belonging to different eigenstates.@xcite on the other hand , for completely random distribution and high concentration of dipoles , the rare instances of extremely close dipoles ( i.e. , with separation @xmath38 ) can prevent the formation of superradiant states.@xcite    the role of interactions in plasmon - mediated cooperative emission is characterized by several distinctive features .",
    "first , since the decay matrices @xmath27 contain plasmon pole , the _ relative _ strength of dipole - dipole interactions is effectively reduced as compared to purely photonic case .",
    "second , there are additional corrections to emitters frequencies , one originating from plasmon - enhanced radiative coupling and another from nonradiative coupling .",
    "while neither of those corrections diverges as dipoles approach each other , the latter becomes very large as dipoles approach the metal surface due to contribution of high-@xmath23 plasmons .",
    "therefore , the actual system eigenstates are determined by _ both _ the interactions and the energy exchange , and their frequencies and decays rates must be found simultaneously .",
    "it is precisely the goal of this paper to calculate the full spectrum of _ interacting _ emitters near a metal np .",
    "specifically , we consider a common situation when emitters , e.g. , fluorescent molecules or quantum dots , are attached to np surface via flexible linkers .",
    "typically , fluorophores bound to linker molecules have certain orientation of their dipole moments with respect to np surface and , due to repulsive interactions , their angular positions are ordered rather then random.@xcite therefore , we assume here that angular positions of emitters coincide with the sites of spherical lattice , such as fullerenes .",
    "specifically , we perform our numerical simulations for c20 , c60 , and c80 configurations for respective number @xmath0 of dipoles ; we also study the effect of deviations from ideal lattice .",
    "we find that not too close to metal surface , the system eigenstates fall into three groups , each dominated by a particular coupling mechanism : three superradiant states dominated by plasmon - enhanced radiative coupling , one state dominated by direct dipole - dipole interactions , and the rest dominated by non - radiative coupling via np .",
    "importantly , superradiant states are _ not _ significantly affected by dipole - dipole interactions whose main effect is a large frequency shift of subradiant state with the smallest decay rate .",
    "we also address the effect of individual emitters internal nonradiative processes on the ensemble quantum efficiency .",
    "internal relaxation is known to inhibit the photonic dicke effect if the corresponding decay rate , @xmath39 , is sufficiently high , i.e. , relaxation time is shorter than the lifetime of superradiant state.@xcite however , near metal nanostructure , the plasmon - enhanced radiative decay rate , @xmath9 , is significantly larger than @xmath39 , so that plasmon - mediated superradiance is less sensitive to quantum yield of individual emitters . specifically , we perform numerical calculations for high - yield and low - yield emitters to show that eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) holds for both types .",
    "more precisely , in cooperative regime , it holds almost exactly for high - yield emitters while for low - yield emitters @xmath29 is somewhat larger than @xmath36 due to the effective @xmath0-fold suppression of @xmath39 by superradiant states decay rate .    an obvious application of plasmon - mediated cooperative emission is related to fluorescence of a large but uncertain number of molecules at some average distances from metal nanostructure . for single - molecule case ,",
    "fluorescence intensity variation with distance was proposed to serve as nanoscopic ruler,@xcite owing to the excellent agreement of measured distance dependences with single - dipole models.@xcite in the case of molecular layer , the ambiguities caused by uncertain molecules number and their separation from the metal surface prevent , in general , determination of system characteristics from fluorescence variations .",
    "however , in cooperative regime , the ambiguity related to molecules number is removed , and fluorescence intensity is essentially determined by eq .",

    "importantly , even with decreasing distance between the emitters in large ensembles , the dipole - dipole interactions still do not destroy cooperative emission .",
    "this can be understood from the following argument.@xcite mixing of superradiant and subradiant states takes place if the interactions between them are sufficiently strong .",
    "the latter requires that the electric field of a collective state is strongly inhomogeneous in space since , e.g. , subradiant states couple only weakly to homogeneous field . on the other hand ,",
    "such a field is comprised of individual fields of all the constituent dipoles so the resulting field s spatial fluctuations are weak if no two dipoles approach too close to each other , i.e. , deviations of nearest - neighbor separations from their average , @xmath185 , @xmath2 being characteristic system size , are small .",
    "however , if deviations from @xmath186 are large , i.e. , two dipoles can be separated by a much closer distance , @xmath187 , causing a strong spatial field fluctuation , then the eigenstates are no longer superradiant and subradiant states and cooperative emission is destroyed .",
    "this argument was confirmed numerically here by finding system eigenstates for both cases  dipoles on a spherical lattice with some fluctuations ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : hist_delta - disorder ] and [ fig : hist_gamma - disorder ] ) , and a completely random angular distribution with _ fixed _ dipole - np distance with no minimal separation between two dipoles ( not shown ) . in the latter case , no superradiant states were formed and the reason was traced to configurations with extremely close dipoles .",
    "note , however , that with both radial and angular distributions being random , these are rare events . in the case of repulsive interactions between individual dipoles , considered here ,",
    "deviations from the average dipole - dipole separation @xmath186 are exceedingly small and cooperative emission survives the interactions .    another sharp contrast between plasmonic and photonic dicke effects is the fate of subradiant states . in the latter , the energy trapped in subradiant states is eventually radiated , albeit with a much slower rate , resulting in sharp spectral features of emission spectrum.@xcite instead , in plasmonic systems , the trapped energy is dissipated in the np and only a small fraction of total energy leaves the system via superradoant states .",
    "thus , the net effect of plasmonic dicke effect is to drastically _ reduce _ the emission as compared to same number of individual dipoles . remarkably , as the eigenvalues scale _ uniformly _ with @xmath0 , the _ quantum efficiencies _ of superradiant states are nearly independent of the ensemble size , leading to the simple relation ( [ energy ] ) that holds in the cooperative regime .",

    "we studied here plasmon - mediated superradiance from an ensemble of dipoles near metal nanoparticle supporting localized surface plasmon , thereby extending the dicke effect to plasmonic systems .",
    "our main conclusion is that the plasmonic dicke effect is a robust phenomenon , more so than the usual photonic dicke effect , because of a more efficient hybridization of individual dipoles via nanoparticle plasmon .",
    "we have established that hybridization takes place through two types of plasmonic coupling mechanisms  plasmon - enhanced radiative coupling and nonradiative plasmon coupling , the latter having no analogue in the usual dicke effect and causing demise of cooperative emission at very close dipole - nanoparticle distances .    while we considered a specific nanostructure  spherical metal particle",
