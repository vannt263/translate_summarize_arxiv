    "for @xmath72 fixed , @xmath85 it decreases like @xmath86 , and analogously for @xmath43 fixed , @xmath87 .",
    "the kernel @xmath88 , when @xmath73 and @xmath67 fixed , has also the asymptotics ( [ eqn16 ] ) , however with an unbounded function @xmath89 , in contrast to @xmath84 ( see below ) .",
    "when @xmath73 and @xmath72 fixed ( and vice versa ) it tends to a constant .",
    "therefore it always dominates over @xmath64 and over @xmath90 .    to disentangle the two different sources of collapse",
    ", we first consider the one channel problem for the component @xmath91 with the kernel @xmath64 , and we remove the second equation from ( [ eq10a ] ) .",
    "we analyse the domain of @xmath67 fixed , where @xmath64 has its maximal asymptotics values .",
    "the @xmath92 domain is finite and the function @xmath93 has no singularities in @xmath92 .",
    "therefore we majorate it by its maximal value . if the stronger , majorated kernel results in stable bound states , the exact one results in stability too .",
    "this method to analyse the cutoff dependence is equivalent to applying the sufficient condition of stability proposed in @xcite .",
    "the inspection of ( [ eq14a ] ) shows that for fixed @xmath94 , the maximum of @xmath84 is achieved at @xmath95 , where it has the form : @xmath96 independent of @xmath44 .",
    "note that @xmath97 is unbounded when @xmath98 .",
    "then we majorate the function @xmath99 by its maximal value relative to @xmath94 : @xmath100 , which is evidently achieved at @xmath101 . with this value of @xmath84 ,",
    "the kernel ( [ eqn16 ] ) exactly coincides with the kernel @xmath90 .",
    "as well known @xcite , with the potential @xmath102 , the binding energy does not depend on cutoff if @xmath103 , what restricts the coupling constant to @xmath104 .",
    "if @xmath105 , the system collapses , what is manifested by the fact that the binding energy tends to @xmath106 when @xmath107 . in this system",
    ", there exists a critical value @xmath108 of the coupling constant , below which the binding energy is stable . majorating the kernel ,",
    "we underestimate @xmath108 .",
    "we calculated also this value @xcite , not majorating the function @xmath109 , but taking into account its dependence on @xmath94 . in this way we find @xmath110 , instead of @xmath111 , when @xmath71 was replaced by 1 .",
    "because of majorating the kernel in the variables @xmath92 , this value should be still smaller than the true @xmath108 but it is in the range @xmath112 we found numerically ( see next section ) .    in the two - channel problem ,",
    "the kernel dominating in asymptotics is @xmath88 . in the case",
    "@xmath50 it is positive and corresponds to repulsion . because of that , this channel does not lead to any collapse .",
    "this repulsion can not prevent from the collapse in the first channel ( for enough large @xmath113 ) , since due to coupling between two channels the singular potential in the channel 1 `` pumps out '' the wave function from the channel 2 into the channel 1 .",
    "so , in the coupled equations system ( [ eq10a ] ) the situation with the cutoff dependence is the same as for one channel .",
    "let us now consider the state @xmath54 .",
    "the asymptotics of the kernel @xmath114 is the same than @xmath115 , it is negative and corresponds to attraction .",
    "since it always dominates over @xmath90 , this attraction is stronger than in the @xmath102 potential .",
    "therefore it results in a collapse for any value of the coupling constant . in the paper @xcite",
    ", this situation corresponds to the two - fermion state described by the components @xmath59 .",
    "the preceding results are confirmed by numerical calculations .",
    "the constituent masses were taken equal to @xmath116=1 and the mass of the exchanged scalar @xmath117=0.25 .",
    "we first present the results given by the single equation for @xmath91 with kernel @xmath64 in the @xmath50 case .",
    "we have plotted in figure [ b_kmax ] the mass square @xmath118 of the two fermion system as a function of the cutoff @xmath62 for two fixed values of the coupling constant below and above the critical value @xmath108 . in our calculations",
    ", the cutoff appears directly as the maximum value @xmath62 up to which the integrals in ( [ eq10a ] ) are performed .",
    "one can see two dramatically different behaviors depending on the value of the coupling constant @xmath113 . for @xmath119 , i.e. @xmath120 , the result is convergent . for @xmath121 ,",
    "i.e. @xmath122 , the result is clearly divergent .",
    "@xmath118 decreases logarithmically as a function of @xmath62 and becomes even negative .",
    "we would like to notice that this divergence is not associated with the non decreasing behavior of the @xmath88 kernel but with the existence of a critical value of the coupling constant separating two dynamical regimes .",
    "this property is due only to the large @xmath43 behavior of @xmath64 .",
    "though the negative values of @xmath118 are physically meaningless , they are formally allowed by the equations ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq10a ] ) .",
    "the first degree of @xmath123 does not enter neither in the equation nor in the kernel , and @xmath118 crosses zero without any singularity .",
    "the value of @xmath124 does not depend on the exchange mass @xmath117 . for @xmath125 ,",
    "e.g. @xmath126 , its existence is not relevant in describing physical states since any solution with positive @xmath118 , stable relative to cutoff , corresponds to @xmath127 . for @xmath128",
    "one can reach the critical @xmath113 for positive , though small values of @xmath118 .",
    "we consider now the full yukawa problem as given by the two coupled equations ( [ eq10a ] ) . in figure [ alpha_kmax_500 ]",
    "are displayed the variations of @xmath118 for @xmath50 or @xmath56 and @xmath54 or @xmath129 states as a function of the cutoff @xmath62 .",
    "the value of the coupling constant for both @xmath45 is @xmath130 , the same that in fig . 2 of @xcite , below the critical value .",
    "our numerical values are in agreement with the results for the cutoff @xmath131 presented in this figure @xcite , but our calculation at larger @xmath62 leads to different conclusion for the @xmath50 state .",
    "we first notice a qualitatively different behavior of the two states . in what",
    "concerns @xmath50 , the curve becomes flat when @xmath62 increases ,  with a 0.1% variation in @xmath118 when changing @xmath62 from 50 to 600 .",
    "we thus conclude to the stability of the state with @xmath50 , as expected from our analysis in sect .",
    "[ depend ] .    on the contrary , for @xmath54 the value of @xmath132 decreases faster than logarithmically what indicates  as found in @xcite",
    " a collapse . as mentioned above , the asymptotics of the @xmath114 kernel is the same as the @xmath133 one but with an opposite sign , i.e. it is attractive , what leads to unstability for any value of @xmath113 .",
    "we found the same result when solving the @xmath50 equations with the opposite sign of @xmath133 .",
    "the light - front solutions of the two fermion system interacting via a scalar exchange have been obtained .",
    "we have found that the @xmath50  or @xmath56  state is stable ( i.e. convergent relative to the cutoff @xmath63 ) for coupling constant below some critical value , in a way similar to what is known in non relativistic quantum mechanics for the @xmath102 potential . in this point ,",
    "our conclusion differs from the one settled in @xcite , where it was stated that the integrals in eqs .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) diverge logarithmically with cutoff . above the critical value the system collapses , what manifests as an unbounded cutoff dependence of @xmath118 . in the @xmath54  or @xmath129  state the system",
    "is found to be always unstable , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "the origin of this unstability for the @xmath50 state differs from @xmath51 .",
    "we have found that the @xmath134 dominating kernel does not generate a collapse because it is repulsive .",
    "the unstability in this case is related to @xmath64 .",
    "these results should be taken into account when carrying out the renormalization procedure .",
    "the explicitly covariant lfd may be efficient for solving this problem , like it has proved to be fruitful for analyzing the yukawa model .",
