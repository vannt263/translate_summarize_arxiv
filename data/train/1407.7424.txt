    "superfluidity plays a key role in many fields of physics , such as liquid helium @xcite , ultracold atomic gases @xcite , quantum magnets @xcite , and astrophysics @xcite .",
    "in particular , superfluid bose - fermi mixtures ( sbfms ) in ultracold atomic gases have attracted considerable interest recently . it is well known that for liquid helium the superfluidity of bosonic @xmath0he and fermionic @xmath1he can be achieved separately .",
    "however , the simultaneous superfluidity for the two isotopes is remarkably prevented by the strong interactions between the two species in spite of such a superfluid @xmath0he-@xmath1he mixture being a long - sought object @xcite . by contrast , a superfluid bose - fermi mixture ( sbfm ) in ultracold atomic gases can be realized by using the combination of the feshbach resonance and radio - frequency techniques .",
    "most recently , a sbfm consisting of condensed @xmath2li bosons and ultracold @xmath3li fermions in two - spin states has been produced by salomon s group ferrier - barbut .",
    "the experimental breakthrough provides new opportunities to study the intriguing properties of sbfms inaccessible in a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) with arbitrary spin @xcite , pure bosonic superfluid mixtures , and pure fermionic superfluid mixtures . as a matter of fact",
    ", many novel physical characteristics have been predicted theoretically in sbfms , including the saturation effect of nonlinear interaction in the strong - coupling unitarity limit @xcite , localized bose - fermi bright soliton @xcite , possibility of simulating dense quantum chromodynamics matter @xcite , phase transition overlapping with phase separation @xcite , and the faraday pattern generation abdullaev .",
    "all existing studies of the sbfms refer to the nonrotating case . considering that one of the most striking hallmarks of a superfluid is its response to rotation , in this paper we investigate the combined effects of rotation and nonlinear interatomic interaction on the exact two - dimensional ( 2d ) topological structure and dynamics of a rotating sbfm , focusing on the superfluid @xmath2li-@xmath3li mixture case as the prototype . here",
    "we present a phenomenological dissipation model @xcite combining with the unitary schrdinger equation for an interacting sbfm @xcite to describe the dynamics of a rotating sbfm .",
    "a ground - state phase diagram for a nonrotating sbfm with specific parameters is given .",
    "we find that the ground - state structure of a nonrotating sbfm is mainly determined by the ratio of the boson - fermion ( bf ) scattering length to the boson - boson ( bb ) scattering length .",
    "furthermore , it is shown that the rotating sbfm with a sufficiently large rotation frequency can display four steady structures : a mixed phase and three typical layer separated phases .",
    "in particular , we show that the generation of visible vortices in the fermionic superfluid displays an evident hysteresis effect during the time evolution of a rotating sbfm . due to the cooper pair entity of fermionic superfluid and the presence of bf and fermion - fermion ( ff ) interactions",

    "the evolution times are @xmath144 ( left ) , @xmath145 ( middle ) , and @xmath146 ( right ) , respectively .",
    "initially , the superfluid densities @xmath147 and @xmath148 in a stationary isotropic harmonic trap are shown in figs .",
    "5(a1 ) and 5(a2 ) . with the development of time ,",
    "the boundary surface of the bosonic superfluid undergo complex turbulent oscillation and many ghost vortices appear at the outskirts of the bec , which can be seen in figs .",
    "6(a1 ) and 6(a3 ) .",
    "in contrast , the fermionic superfluid remains basically unchanged , as shown in figs .",
    "6(a2 ) and 6(a4 ) .",
    "essentially , these ghost vortices are generated by collective excitations through the nonlinear atomic interactions and the landau instability associated with the negative excitation frequency @xcite because the rotating harmonic trap is isotropic and has rotation symmetry .",
    "this characteristic is evident especially for the component of fermionic superfluid [ see figs .",
    "6(a2)6(c2 ) and figs .",
    "6(a4)6(c4 ) ] .",
    "thus here the formation mechanism of topological defects is different from the case of a rotating anisotropic harmonic potential , where ghost vortices mainly result from the dynamical instability through the rapid modulation of trapping anisotropy @xcite .",
    "the angular momentum is transferred into the sbfm via the excitations of surface modes or the generation of visible vortices and hidden vortices . with the further time evolution ,",
    "some ghost vortices penetrate into the bec and become visible vortices or hidden vortices due to the landau instability [ see figs .",
    "6(b1)6(c1 ) and figs .",
    "6(b3)6(c3 ) ] , where the visible vortices arrange themselves irregularly .",
    "when the rotating sbfm reaches an equilibrium state , the visible vortices form a triangular lattice such that the energy of the system approaches the minimum in the rotating frame . compared with the rotating bec , the vortex ( including ghost vortex and visible vortex ) formation in the rotating fermionic superfluid exhibits an evident hysteresis effect , as shown in figs . 6 and 5 .",

    "first , in the latter case , the vortices in the two becs are always generated simultaneously kasamatsu2,woo , mason , while here the vortex formation in the superfluid fermions is far later than that in the bec due to the presence of cooper pair with attractive ff interaction .",
    "second , in the presence of dissipation , there are triangular visible vortex lattices and singly quantized hidden vortices formed in a rotating sbfm . in our simulation , we did not observe the generation of vortex sheet or square vortex lattice occurring in a rotating two - component bec @xcite .",
    "these structures as well as the giant vortex are suppressed by the dissipation term in our simulation .",
    "in summary , we have studied the structures for rotating and non - rotating superfluid bose - fermi mixtures and the dynamics of vortex formation in a rotating superfluid bose - fermi mixture .",
    "we show that the ratio of bf interaction to bb interaction plays a key role in determining the ground - state structure of a nonrotating sbfm . for fixed bb and bf @xmath22-wave scattering lengths , the variation of ff ( spin - up and -down )",
    "@xmath22-wave scattering length does not influence the phase diagram for a nonrotating sbfm .",
    "furthermore , depending on the choice of parameters , we find that a rotating sbfm with a sufficiently large angular velocity supports four typical steady structures : a mixed phase and three layer - separated phases .",
    "in addition , it is shown that different separated phases at the initial time may result in almost the same steady structures .",
    "in particular , we find that the generation of visible vortices in the fermionic superfluid exhibits an evident hysteresis effect during the time evolution of a rotating sbfm .",
    "our results indicate that the topological structure and the dynamics of a rotating sbfm are remarkably different from the cases of rotating two - component becs .",
    "we expect that our findings can be observed and tested in future experiments . in the mean time",
