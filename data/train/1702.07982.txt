    "<S> the weyl surfaces between bands @xmath65 and @xmath164 are given by @xmath172 , @xmath173 and @xmath174 , while those between bands @xmath164 and @xmath175 ( also between @xmath114 and @xmath65 ) are given by @xmath176 . the tpt can be driven by tuning @xmath122 from negative ( ti ) to positive ( ni ) , and the evolution of these low energy weyl surfaces are illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ tini ] ( a)-(f ) in the 3d subspace @xmath177 and @xmath163 . </S>",
    "<S> the small blue loops are the images of weyl surfaces between bands @xmath65 and @xmath164 , while the red loop at @xmath83 is that between bands @xmath164 and @xmath175 . at first , </S>",
    "<S> two pairs of blue weyl surfaces arise unlinked ( panel ( b ) ) . as @xmath122 increases </S>",
    "<S> , they merge into four new weyl surfaces linked with the red weyl surface , which then wind around the red weyl surface and merge into unlinked pairs again with their partners exchanged ( panels ( c)-(e ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the four unlinked blue weyl surfaces contract to zero , and the system becomes a 5d ni . similar to the ci case , if @xmath178 , the @xmath0 symmetry is recovered , and the 4 blue weyl surfaces will collapse into 4 yang monopoles . </S>",
    "<S> the tpt process then involves winding of yang monopoles instead of linked weyl surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the topological surface states of the system also involves a topological transition during the tpt . </S>",
    "<S> the topological surface states of a noncentrosymmetric 5d ti is generically a `` weyl ring '' as shown in fig.[tini](g ) . </S>",
    "<S> the tpt then breaks into two weyl arcs ( panel ( h ) ) , which finally vanish when entering the ni phase . in conclusion , we show that 5d weyl semimetals with yang monopoles are protected by the @xmath0 symmetry , and generically reduce to 5d weyl semimetals with linked weyl surfaces in the presence of @xmath0 symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore expect that yang monopoles generically break into linked u(1 ) monopole 2-branes in 5d theories of gauge symmetry breaking from u(2 ) to u(1)@xmath102u(1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> as gapless states carrying the second chern number , they emerge as intermediate phases in the tpts between cis and nis or between tis and nis in 5d space , generalizing the connection between gapless and gapped topological phases in 3d @xcite .    _ </S>",
