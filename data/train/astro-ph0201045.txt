    "gravitational microlensing is one of the most promising tools to study invisible lenses like machos and low - mass stars in the galaxy . paczynski ( 1986 )",
    "first proposed to use microlensing effect to search for machos in the galaxy s halo based on a photometric monitoring of millions of stars in the galaxy s bulge and the magellanic clouds .",
    "a number of groups have been conducting such ` photometric ' searches of microlensing to detect source magnification by gravitational microlensing ( e.g. , macho , eros , ogle , moa , etc . ) , finding more than a hundred of photometric microlensing events .",
    "in addition to such photometric microlensing , there is another type of microlensing called ` astrometric microlensing ' , in which the positional shift of the lensed image , rather than the magnification of the source , is used to detect microlensing events .",
    "recently , a number of studies have been made on such ` astrometric ' microlensing events ( e.g. , hosokawa et al .",
    "1993 ; 1997 ; hg , novikov & polnarev 1995 ; miyamoto & yoshii 1995 ; walker 1995 ; paczynski 1996 ; 1998 ; miralda - escude 1996 ; boden et al . 1998 ; dominik & sahu 2000 ) .",
    "one of the major findings of these studies is that the probability of astrometric microlensing is much larger than that of photometric microlensing ( e.g. , miralda - escude 1996 ; hosokawa et al.1997 ; dominik & sahu 2000 ; honma 2001 ) .",
    "for instance , the size of a photometric lens is equal to the einstein - ring size given by @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the lens mass , and @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are the observer - lens distance , lens - source distance , and observer - source distance , respectively . if a source comes within this radius from the lens , a source is magnified by more than a factor of 1.34 .",
    "meanwhile , the size of an astrometric lens is larger than @xmath10 by a factor of @xmath11 , which is given by following equation ( e.g. , honma 2001 ) . @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the angular size of the einstein - ring radius ( @xmath14 ) , and @xmath15 is the minimum angular shift that can be detected by astrometric observation .",
    "thus , if a source comes within @xmath16 from the lens , the source position is shifted by larger than @xmath15 . for astrometric lensing",
    ", @xmath11 can be as large as 50 @xmath4 100 assuming @xmath15 of 10-@xmath0as level ( e.g. , honma 2001 ) .",
    "such a high astrometric accuracy , although not yet achieved , will be available soon because a number of astrometric missions are planned in early 21st centuries .",
    "for instance , there are four space astrometric missions to be launched by @xmath42010 : diva , fame , sim and gaia .",
    "astrometric accuracies anticipated for those missions are : 200 @xmath0as for diva , 50 @xmath0as for fame , and 10 @xmath0as ( or possibly higher ) for sim and gaia .",
    "in addition to those space missions , there is another ground - based astrometric mission called vera ( vlbi exploration of radio astrometry , e.g. , sasao 1996 ; honma , kawaguchi & sasao 2000 and reference therein ) , which utilize a phase - referencing vlbi technique for astrometry of radio sources .",
    "the most remarkable difference between vera and space astrometric missions is that vera can observe thousands of distant sources like qsos and radio galaxies to trace effect of astrometric microlensing",
    ". an advantages of using distant radio sources is that the column density of lens can be much higher , leading to higher event probability .",
    "investigating disk stars by astrometric microlensing with missions described above has significant scientific merits .",
    "first , astrometric microlensing provide us a new tool to study the lower end of stellar mass function , which is thought to be dominant populations in the galaxy s disk . to date , the shape of the mass function remains uncertain in particular at its lower end , because the lower main - sequence stars are too faint for optical observations .",
    "studying the low - mass star may also inform us about the nature of dark matter in the disk , as the disk dark matter may be baryonic matter in the form of low - mass stars and/or brown dwarfs .",
    "further , studies of astrometric microlensing by disk stars will also provide fundamental information on parameters of the galaxy s disk .",
    "for instance , one can estimate the disk scale length from the optical depth distribution with the galactic latitude @xmath17 ( e.g. , dominik & sahu 2000 ) .",
    "also , it is possible to extract the disk density from astrometric microlensing events provided sufficient number of events are observed for statistics . from the scale length and disk density , one can estimate the total mass of the galaxy s disk , and thus the density profile of dark halo inside in the disk region can be also deduced .    while the astrometric microlensing of stars are extensively studied in previous studies focusing on implications for sim and gaia(e.g . , dominik & sahu 2000 ) ,",
    "there has been no study on astrometric microlensing of distant radio sources by disk stars considering an application to vera .",
    "the most remarkable aspect of using distant sources is that some important parameters such as the lens mass may be determined independently of lens distance ( e.g. , honma 2001 ) , as well as high event probability due to large column density toward a source . for these reasons , in the present paper we extensively study the astrometric microlensing of distant sources by disk stars , and discuss its implications for vera .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in section 2 we present calculations of optical depth , and in section 3 event rate .",
    "we also compare results for qso - disk / bulge lensing cases with disk / bulge - disk lensing cases . in section 4 , we present event durations of astrometric events , and in section 5 we discuss how the lens mass can be estimated from event durations . finally in section 6 , we discuss the implication of astrometric microlensing for vera , and also summarize the findings of the present paper .",
    "the optical depth of astrometric microlensing event is defined as follows ( e.g. , miralda - escude 1996 ) : @xmath18 here , @xmath10 is the einstein - ring radius , @xmath19 is the mass density in the lens , @xmath7 is the lens distance from the observer , and @xmath6 is the lens mass . note that this lens mass should be regarded as the mean lens mass averaged over the possible range of stellar mass function ( the effect of stellar mass function will be discussed later in the present paper ) .",
    "the factor @xmath11 , defined in equation ( [ eq : beta_max ] ) , denotes the ratio of astrometric lens size to the einstein ring size .",
    "the factor of @xmath20 in equation ( [ eq : tau_ast ] ) is crucial to the difference of the optical depth between astrometric and photometric microlensing .",
    "as is mentioned earlier , in the distant source case @xmath11 could be as large as 50 @xmath4 100 , and thus the optical depth for astrometric microlensing could be larger than that of photometric microlensing by 3 to 4 orders of magnitudes . by substituting the expression of @xmath10 and @xmath11 into equation ( [ eq : tau_ast ] ) , one can obtain following expression of the optical depth , @xmath21 interestingly , the optical depth is proportional to the mean lens mass @xmath6 , in contrast to photometric microlensing in which the optical depth is independent of the mean lens mass @xmath6 .",
    "for the density distribution in the galaxy s disk , we assume an exponential disk for both radial and vertical profiles , namely , @xmath22 here , @xmath23 is the disk density in the vicinity of the sun , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the radial and vertical scale lengths , respectively .",
    "we take rather conservative values for these parameters as @xmath26 pc@xmath27 , @xmath28 kpc , and @xmath29 pc ( table 1 summarizes the model parameters used in this paper ) .",
    "note that the disk model and its parameters considered here are the same as those used in previous studies ( e.g. , hosokawa et al .",
    "1997 ; dominik , sahu 2000 ; honma 2001 ) .    in order to take into account the contributions from bulge stars , we consider a bulge model whose density distribution is given by a spherical plummer model .",
    "the density distribution of the bulge is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the total mass and @xmath32 is the scale length of the bulge , respectively .",
    "although the bulge may be elongated and bar - like system as suggested by recent studies , here we do not consider such an asymmetric density distribution , as the precise parameters of bulge elongation is still highly uncertain .",
    "for the bulge parameters , we assume the bulge mass @xmath31 of @xmath33 and the scale length @xmath32 of 1 kpc ( e.g. , dehnen & binney 1998 ) .    here",
    "we also introduce the stellar mass function to calculate the mean lens mass @xmath6 . to be conservative",
    ", we assume the salpeter - type stellar mass function with the power law index of 2.35 , namely , @xmath34 here @xmath35 gives a scaling constant , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the lower and upper cutoff of the stellar mass function .",
    "based on that mass function , we obtain the mean lens mass as @xmath38 with a lower cutoff @xmath39 of 0.08@xmath40 , which corresponds to the hydrogen burning limit , we obtain the mean mass of @xmath41 ( note that @xmath6 is independent of @xmath42 provided @xmath42 is sufficiently large ) .",
    "this mass @xmath6 of @xmath41 corresponds to that of lower main - sequence stars , which are thought to be dominant populations in the galaxy s stellar component .",
    "thus , in the following sections we assume the mean lens mass of 0.3@xmath40 except otherwise noted .",
    "of course , the mean mass is quite uncertain since we have little knowledge of the lower end of the stellar mass function . in case of different mean mass , the optical depth for mean lens mass @xmath43 can be obtained by multiplying a factor of @xmath44 to the optical depth obtained in the present paper .",
    "using equations described above , one can obtain the optical depth for astrometric microlensing .",
    "in the present paper , we consider several cases with different source and lens populations .",
    "table 2 summarizes the cases we consider in the present paper . for qso - disk and qso - bulge lensing , in which distant",
    "qso is being lensed by disk or bulge stars , the distance to qso is assumed to be infinite . on the other hand , for disk - disk lensing case , we assume the source distance @xmath9 of 8 kpc .",
    "the first reason for setting @xmath45 kpc is that the distance corresponds to that to the disk stars near the galactic center , where the disk density is highest .",
    "the second reason is that bright stars like agb have @xmath46 of 0 mag , and hence their apparent magnitude becomes about 15 mag at the distance of 8 kpc in case of no interstellar extinction .",
    "since the stars at low galactic latitude significantly suffer from strong absorption by the interstellar medium ( later we will show that we have to observe stars at fairly low latitude to detect an astrometric microlensing ) , their apparent magnitude could be reduced to @xmath420 mag or even fainter , which is close to or below the limiting magnitude of optical astrometric missions like sim and gaia . meanwhile , for bulge - disk or bulge - bulge lensing case , we assume a slightly longer distance , @xmath9 of 10 kpc .",
    "this is because a part of bulge sources can be seen through low - extinction regions like the baade window , which are a few degrees away from the galactic center . in these windows",
    ", we may be able to observe slightly far sources compared to disk sources partly because the extinction is low , and partly because there are quite many bright stars like bulge red giants ( note that these  windows are not suitable for search for disk lens event since their galactic latitude is too high for disk lensing ; for instance , @xmath47 for the baade window ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the optical depths calculated for the cases described above .",
    "first of all , for qso - disk / bulge lensing case , the maximum optical depth is obtained for sources behind the galactic center ( i.e. , @xmath48 ) ) , being @xmath1 for disk lens , and @xmath2 for bulge lens , respectively .",
    "this result indicates that nearly one of ten sources in this direction is always lensed by disk stars , and the optical depth of bulge lens is nearly half of that of disk lens ( we will discuss how to discriminate disk lens event from bulge lens event later )",
    ". however , the optical depth for bulge lens rapidly decrease with increasing @xmath17 , and its contribution becomes negligible at @xmath49 . for qso - disk lensing ,",
    "the dependence on @xmath50 is much stronger that on that @xmath17 .",
    "for instance , the optical depth at @xmath51 is smaller than that at @xmath52 by almost an order of magnitude .",
    "this strong dependence comes from the short vertical scale length @xmath25 ( 300 pc ) compared to the radial scale length @xmath24 ( 3.5 kpc ) .",
    "these results indicate that one should look for astrometric microlensing by disk stars at fairly low galactic latitude ( e.g. , less than 2 degrees ) .    for comparison",
    ", we also show in figure 1 the optical depth for disk - disk lensing case and bulge - bulge / disk lensing cases . from figure 1",
    "one can find that the maximum optical depth for disk - disk lensing is 6.2@xmath53 , being smaller by a factor of 15 than the maximum optical depth for qso - disk lensing . also , the maximum optical depth for bulge - disk lensing case is 9.3@xmath53 , 10 times smaller than that for qso - disk lensing .",
    "the optical depth for bulge - bulge lensing case is far smaller , being 1.0@xmath53 .",
    "these significant differences of optical depths between distant source and disk / bulge source cases can be understood if one carefully looks at the equation ( [ eq : tau_ast2 ] ) . in the distant source case ,",
    "the factor @xmath54 is almost unity within the entire galaxy , and thus the largest contribution to the optical depth occurs at the galactic center , where the disk density is highest . on the other hand , in the disk - disk lensing case the largest contribution to the optical depth comes from stars near the sun ( where the disk density is relatively low ) , because the factor of @xmath54 becomes fairly small for lenses near the galactic center .",
    "this fact also explains that for the disk - disk lensing case the dependence of @xmath55 on @xmath17 is not so strong as that for the qso - disk case : the density of local stars , which contribute most to the optical depth , does not vary strongly with changing @xmath17 .",
    "the event rate is another important quantity in microlensing study , since the event rate is directly related to the observational strategy .",
    "the event rate is usually defined as the number of lenses coming inside the microlensing tube per unit time ( e.g. , griest 1991 ) .",
    "the radius of the microlensing tube is given by the lens size , which is @xmath16 for astrometric microlensing . by definition ,",
    "the event rate strongly depends on the distribution of tangential velocity of lenses , and thus is usually a function of velocity distribution of lens population . in this section , for simplicity , we assume that the tangential velocity of lens relative to the tube @xmath56 is uniquely determined at a given distance @xmath7 .",
    "this @xmath56 corresponds to an averaged tangential velocity at a given distance , which can be obtained by integrating the velocity distribution function over the possible velocity range ( in later section we will treat the effect of velocity distribution function more precisely ) . under this assumption",
    ", the event rate for astrometric microlensing @xmath57 can be written as @xmath58 this expression is correct regardless of the shape of velocity distribution function .",
    "for instance , in case that the lens population has an isotropic velocity distribution , the number flux of lenses which crosses unit area per unit time ( @xmath59 ) is given by @xmath60 note that only the population coming in the tube is considered but the population going out of the tube is ignored . since the area of the lensing tube per unit length @xmath61 is @xmath62 , one can obtain the event rate per unit length ( @xmath63 ) as @xmath64 which is a differential form of equation ( [ eq : gamma ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the lens population is perfectly streaming in a direction without any random motion , the number flux of lenses per unit area per time is given by @xmath65 ( assuming that the streaming motion is perpendicular to the unit area considered ) .",
    "since the geometric cross section of the tube per unit length seen from the lens population is @xmath66 , one may obtain the same expression for the differential event rate @xmath63 for the isotropic case .",
    "substituting equations ( [ eq : e - ring ] ) and ( [ eq : beta_max ] ) into ( [ eq : gamma ] ) , one may obtain the following expression of the event rate , @xmath67 note that the event rate for astrometric microlensing is independent of the lens mass @xmath6 , as is pointed out in previous studies ( e.g. , dominik & sahu 2000 ; honma 2001 ) .",
    "the tangential velocity of the lens relative to the tube can be defined using the motion of source , lens and observer as follows , @xmath68 here @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 are the two dimensional velocities of the observer , source , and lens perpendicular to the line of sight . in order to take into account the effect of velocity dispersion in a rather simple manner , here we calculate the lens tangential velocity @xmath56 as @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the velocity dispersion of the lens and source population , respectively .    the velocities of disk stars can be easily described based on the so - called flat - rotation model . since the rotation velocity of the galaxy s disk is known to be almost constant at any galacto - centric distance , here we assume a constant circular velocity @xmath75 of 220 km / s ( e.g. , kerr & lynden - bell 1986 ) .",
    "given the circular velocity in the disk and star position ( @xmath17 , @xmath50 and the distance to the star ) , one can determine its tangential motion with respect to the line of sight caused by the galactic rotation .",
    "in addition to circular rotation velocity , stars in the disk are known to have velocity dispersion of 15 @xmath4 20 km / s , and thus in case of disk stars ( acting as both lens and source ) we set @xmath73 and/or @xmath74 of 20 km / s .    in figure 2",
    "we show the distribution of @xmath56 with the lens distance @xmath7 .",
    "figure 2 clearly demonstrates the difference of tangential velocities in two cases ; qso - disk lensing and disk - disk lensing case . for the qso - disk lensing case ,",
    "the largest tangential velocity is obtained toward a source behind the galaxy s center , which is as large as 440 km / s .",
    "this velocity , corresponding to 2@xmath76 , is obtained because behind the galactic center the lens motion becomes completely opposite to the observer motion . on the other hand , for the disk source case",
    "the largest tangential velocity is not larger than 100 km / s .",
    "this is due to the fact that the source is not further than the galaxy s center , and thus the source as well as the lens are moving in the same direction as that of the observer . in particular , in the vicinity of the sun ( i.e. , within 1 kpc from the sun ) , where the contribution to the optical depth becomes the maximum for disk - disk lensing case , the tangential velocity @xmath56 is no larger than 40 km / s , which is an order of magnitude smaller than the largest tangential velocity for qso - disk lensing case .",
    "these facts imply that the event rate for disk source case could be significantly smaller than that for distant source case .    on the other hand , for the bulge model we use the isothermal velocity dispersion obtained from the plummer potential .",
    "for the tangential velocity dispersion , the plummer model gives ( e.g. , lynden - bell 1962 ) @xmath77 the parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the bulge mass and the scale length , and taken to be @xmath78 and @xmath79 kpc , as described in the previous section . with these parameters ,",
    "the tangential velocity dispersion at the galactic center becomes @xmath80km / s , which is in agreement with observed velocity dispersion ( e.g. , tiede & terndrup 1999 ) .",
    "the bulge is also known to have a rigid rotation with an angular velocity of @xmath81 km / s / kpc ( tiede & terndrup 1999 ) . in the present paper , however , we do not include this rigid rotation , since at the central bulge ( where most of bulge lensing events occur ) , the tangential velocity is dominated by the velocity dispersion rather than the rotational motion .",
    "based on the tangential velocity and density distribution described above , one can calculate the event rate of astrometric microlensing using equation ( [ eq : gamma ] ) .",
    "figures 3 shows the event rate distributions for cases considered in the previous sections ( see table 2 ) . from figure 3",
    "one sees that for qso - disk lensing case the maximum event rate is @xmath82 event / yr , which is reasonably high for practical observations .",
    "in fact , this indicates that an event can be detected if one observes 100 sources for a year , or 10 sources for 10 years .",
    "if 50 sources are monitored for the whole mission lifetime of vera ( @xmath83yr ) , one can expect to find @xmath410 astrometric microlensing events . for qso - bulge lensing case ,",
    "the maximum event rate is @xmath84 , nearly half of that for qso - disk lensing .",
    "thus , for qso behind the galactic center , the total event rate will be around 1.7@xmath3 event per year .    the fact that qso - disk lensing and qso - bulge lensing rates are comparable raises a new problem , that is how to discriminate disk lens events from bulge lens events . to do this",
    ", one can use an additional observable of astrometric microlensing event , which is the direction of lens motion . if the whole source motion along the circular trajectory is monitored",
    ", then one can directly determine the direction of lens motion ; the lens motions is perpendicular to the line connecting between the original source position and the position of maximum image shift .",
    "for qso - disk lensing , one can expect that the direction of the lens motion is along the galactic plane .",
    "for instance , a typical disk lens behind the galactic center is moving at 400 km / s with respect to the lensing tube , while that star is likely to have a random motion of only 20 km / s or so ( disk velocity dispersion ) .",
    "therefore , the alignment of the lens direction and the galactic plane should be within a few degrees ( @xmath4 20/400 radian ) . on the other hand , since for qso - bulge lensing case the lens tangential velocity is dominated by the random motion of bulge stars , there should be no tight correlations between the direction of the lens motion and the galactic plane .    for disk - disk lensing case",
    "the largest event rate is @xmath85 , being @xmath86 times smaller than that for the qso - disk lensing case , and also 10 times smaller than that for qso - bulge case . at the galactic center ( @xmath17 , @xmath50)=(@xmath87 ) the event rate for disk - disk lensing is only @xmath88 .",
    "this small event rate comes from the small tangential velocity for the disk source case as well as the fact that stars around the galactic center , where the stellar density is highest , make little contributions to the disk - disk lensing ( as discussed for the optical depth calculation ) . at the galactic center",
    "the bulge - disk lensing case and bulge - bulge case give higher event rate than that for the disk - disk lensing case , being @xmath89 and @xmath85 , respectively .",
    "this is due to higher velocity dispersion in the bulge than in the disk .",
    "hence , if one looks for astrometric microlensing events with space astrometric missions like sim and gaia , it is better to observe bulge sources rather than disk stars .",
    "note that for disk - disk lensing cases the maximum event rate is obtained at @xmath90 rather than toward the galactic center .",
    "this is because the event rate ( equation[[eq : gamma ] ] ) is obtained by integrating a product of the density @xmath19 and tangential velocity @xmath56 : while the maximum density along the line of sight is decreasing with @xmath17 , the maximum tangential velocity is peaked around @xmath90 . on the other hand , toward @xmath91 the rotation velocities of the source ,",
    "lens and observer cancel out , and the tangential velocity reduces to the velocity dispersion @xmath92 , making the event rate fairly small .",
    "the event duration , which is one of the most important observables in individual microlensing events , is defined as period during which a lens is located within a microlensing tube . for astrometric microlensing",
    ", the event duration can be described as @xmath93 where @xmath94 corresponds to the lens diameter and the angle @xmath95 defines the lens - source impact parameter as @xmath96 .",
    "the averaged event duration can be obtained by integrating @xmath97 over possible range of @xmath95 as ( e.g. , honma 2001 ) @xmath98 substituting equations ( [ eq : e - ring ] ) and ( [ eq : beta_max ] ) into ( [ eq : t - ast - av ] ) , one can obtain @xmath99 note that the average event duration is defined at any lens distance @xmath7 , and varies with changing @xmath7 through the factor of @xmath100 as well as @xmath56 , which also depends on @xmath7 .",
    "thus , in order to obtain expected event duration toward a source ( hereafter denoted as @xmath101 ) , one has to integrate the average event duration @xmath102 along the line of sight from observer to source .",
    "we also note that for distant source case , the averaged event duration becomes independent of the lens distance as @xmath100 approaches to unity ( honma 2001 ) .",
    "hence , for distant source case , the uncertainty in lens mass determination can be smaller than that for disk source case .    while one can obtain the expected event duration @xmath101 by integrating equation ( [ eq : t - ast - av2 ] ) over possible range of @xmath7 , here we use another simple way , that is to use the optical depth and event rate obtained in the previous sections .",
    "these two quantities are related to the expected event duration through the following equation , @xmath103 based on this equation together with the optical depth and event rate calculated in previous sections , we calculate the event duration .",
    "figure 4 shows the distribution of @xmath101 with various lines of sight , for both of disk / bulge source and distant source cases .",
    "for qso - disk lensing , @xmath101 is found to be 7.5 yr toward the galactic center ( in case of @xmath104 ) . around the galactic center region ( e.g. , @xmath105 ) ,",
    "the expected event duration changes only slightly with @xmath17 , but increases rapidly for the outer galaxy lenses ( @xmath106 to 180@xmath107 ) , reaching at 91 yr at the anti - galactic center . hence , in order to detect events within rather practical time - scale ( i.e. , less than 20 yr ) , one should observe sources around the galactic center regions .    for qso - disk lensing toward the galactic center region ,",
    "the lenses may be divided into two populations based on their location along the line of sight , namely the lenses in front of the galactic center and the lenses behind the galactic center .",
    "for these two populations , the relative proper motions of the lens are completely different : while the proper motion of lens in front of the galactic center is dominated by the velocity dispersion in the disk , the proper motion of lens behind the galactic center is dominated by the galactic rotation ( see figure 2 ) . due to this difference , these two populations also have different distribution of event rate and event durations . to show this clearly , in figure 5 and 6 we show the dependence of differential event rate and event duration on the lens distance .",
    "as seen in figure 5 , most of events are likely to be caused by the stars behind the galactic center because of the large proper motion .",
    "for instance , toward @xmath91 about 95% of events are caused by the stars behind the galactic center .",
    "figure 6 shows that the events caused by stars behind the galactic center have shorter event duration because of larger proper motion .",
    "in fact , for the case of @xmath91 , the lenses behind the galactic center gives a typical duration of 4.1 yr , while the lenses in front of the galactic center gives a duration of 91 yr . in practice , however , the distinction between two populations is not as clear as in figure 5 or 6 because of the effect of the mass function or velocity dispersion .",
    "for instance , a less massive star in front of the galactic center could cause shorter event , which may be comparable to events caused by more massive star behind the galactic center ( in the next section , we will discuss the effect of the mass function and the velocity dispersion more precisely ) .    on the other hand , for disk - disk lensing case",
    ", the dependence of @xmath101 on @xmath17 ( figure 4 ) is not simple , having multiple local maximum and minimum values .",
    "the minimum event duration is obtained toward @xmath90 where the tangential velocity of the lens is largest ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the minimum event duration is found to be 15 yr , being twice of the minimum duration for the distant source case . with increasing the galactic longitude @xmath17 , the expected event duration increases toward @xmath108 , where the tangential velocity is dominated by the disk velocity dispersion .",
    "toward the outer galaxy ( @xmath106 to @xmath109 ) , the duration is between 55 to 70 yr depending on @xmath17 , with another local maximum at @xmath110 .",
    "note that for the disk star case the tangential velocity becomes equal to the disk velocity dispersion at both @xmath91 and @xmath109 , but the expected event duration @xmath101 is slightly different from each other , since the mean distance to the lens , and hence the mean angular size of the lens are different at @xmath91 and @xmath109 ( this difference of mean lens distance comes from the density distribution in the disk ) . in any case , the event duration can not be less than 10 yr for the disk source case .",
    "hence the event duration seems too long for practical observation when one considers that the lifetime of space astrometric missions is @xmath111 yr at longest .",
    "note that this long duration for disk - disk event mainly comes from the assumption that the source is no further than the galactic center ( the distance is assumed to be 8 kpc in this paper ) .",
    "in such a disk - disk event , observer , lens and sources move toward nearly same direction , and thus the lens - source proper motion is small , being dominated by the disk velocity dispersion . on the other hand , for a source star behind the galactic center ,",
    "the relative proper motion of lens is dominated by the galactic rotation rather than the disk velocity dispersion ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "thus , if one can observe a distant disk star located behind the galactic center , one would be able to detect disk - disk events with relatively short duration .",
    "however , in practice , this is extremely difficult for astrometric space missions like sim and gaia because of heavy dust extinction in the galactic plane .",
    "to detect such an event , an astrometric mission at infrared will be necessary .    for the bulge - source cases ( bulge - bulge and bulge - disk lensing ) , figure 4 shows that the event duration can be practically short .",
    "for instance , at the galactic center the expected event duration is 8.1 yr for bulge - disk lensing case , and 2.6 yr for bulge - bulge lensing .",
    "this short event duration comes from large velocity dispersion of bulge stars . in case of bulge - bulge lensing",
    ", there is another reason for short event duration , that the lens size itself is substantially small because of short lens - source distance ( since both lens and source are in the bulge ) .",
    "therefore , if one looks for astrometric microlensing at optical / near infrared bands , which are the main observational bands of space astrometric missions , it is practical to monitor the bulge sources , rather than disk sources .",
    "when an astrometric microlensing event is detected , the lens mass can be estimated from the event duration , because the event duration is proportional to the lens mass in astrometric microlensing ( see , for instance , equation [ [ eq : t - ast - av2 ] ] ) . as is mentioned earlier",
    ", the most interesting aspect of equation ( [ eq : t - ast - av2 ] ) is that for distant source case the factor @xmath112 approximately becomes unity , and hence the average event duration becomes independent of the lens distance .",
    "we note , however , that one can not uniquely determine the lens mass for individual events , since there is no way to know the lens - source impact parameters and/or tangential velocity for individual events .",
    "also , disk / bulge stellar masses are not unique but have a certain range according to the stellar mass function .",
    "therefore , we need some statistical treatments when converting the event duration to the mean lens mass . in this section ,",
    "we consider such effects based on more realistic models of the velocity dispersion and stellar mass function in the bulge and disk .    instead of equation ( [ eq : gamma ] ) ,",
    "here we consider more general form of the event rate given by @xmath113 here @xmath114 expresses the distribution of lens tangential velocity relative to the microlensing tube , and @xmath115 denotes the stellar mass function , which are normalized so that @xmath116 and @xmath117 , respectively . from the relation between @xmath56 and @xmath97 ( equation [ eq : t - ast ] ) , one can obtain @xmath118 together with above equations , the event rate may be written as @xmath119 by differentiating equation ( [ eq : gamma - with - fm ] ) with respect to @xmath97 , one can also obtain the differential event rate @xmath120 , which shows the distribution of observed event rate against event duration .    figure 7 shows this @xmath120 against @xmath97 for the cases considered in previous sections ( qso - disk , qso - bulge , disk - disk , bulge - disk , and bulge - bulge lensing ) .",
    "all of the results presented in figure 7 are calculated for ( @xmath17 , @xmath50)=(0@xmath107 , 0@xmath107 ) . for qso - disk and qso - bulge cases ,",
    "there is a sharp peak at short duration ( @xmath4 a few years ) , which corresponds to events caused by the stars located at the lower end of the stellar mass function .",
    "thus , if one can trace this peaks , it is possible to determine  typical lens mass , which is likely to be ( or at least fairly close to ) the minimum cutoff mass of the mass function ( provided a sharp cutoff of the stellar mass function really exists ) .",
    "for instance , for qso - disk lensing cases the tangential velocity of lens is likely to be around 440 km / s ( see figure 2 ) and the event duration becomes independent of the lens distance @xmath7 ( equation [ [ eq : t - ast - av2 ] ] ) .",
    "thus the strong peak of the differential event rate is likely to be caused by lenses with rather unique parameters ; @xmath121 and @xmath122 km / s . for bulge - disk and bulge - bulge cases ,",
    "there still exist a peak like qso - disk / bilge lensing cases , but at @xmath123 . also , the probability of lensing is lower by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "hence , it is not easy to estimate simply a typical lens mass for bulge source cases but one has to take a careful statistical treatment . for disk - disk cases ,",
    "there is no such a sharp peak in @xmath120 plot .",
    "possible reason for this is that for disk - disk case the lens distance widely ranges ( @xmath124 from 0 to unity ) and also the tangential velocity varies significantly with lens distance ( see figure 2 ) , which causes nearly equal - weight contribution of lens with wide range of @xmath56 and @xmath7 .",
    "figure 8 , which is a plot of cumulative event rate vs event duration , shows this situation from a different point of view . in figure 8 , for qso - disk and bulge - bulge events , the cumulative event rate is steeply rising with increasing even duration , demonstrating that more than 80% of events have event duration less than 4 yr . for bulge - disk and qso - bulge lensing cases , the rise at short event duration is relatively gentle , but yet 80% of events have duration less than 8 yr .",
    "in contrast to these cases , the cumulative event rate for disk - disk lensing case is only slowly increasing with event duration , indicating considerable contributions of events with long duration .",
    "note that for qso - disk and bulge - bulge lensing cases the steep rise in the cumulative event rate strongly depends on whether a sharp truncation of the stellar mass function really exists . if the stellar mass function has a turnover at a certain mass and gently declining toward its lower end , then the rise of the cumulative event rate would be softened . in that case",
    ", it is not so easy to estimate of a typical mass of  dominant population .",
    "alternatively , one needs to calculate many of plots like figure 8 with various model parameters as templates , and a comparison between these templates and observed event durations should be made to extract reliable information on the lens mass ( and possibly the stella mass function ) from astrometric microlensing events .",
    "thus , figure 8 gives an example of such templates to be compared with observed astrometric events .",
    "in this section , we discuss the implication of astrometric microlensing for vera by focusing on the strategy of practical observations .",
    "first , here we briefly summarize advantages as well as disadvantages of using vera for astrometric microlensing search .",
    "advantages of the distant source case ( which is the case for vera ) can be summarized as follows : i ) large event probability expected from the optical depth and event rate , ii ) short event duration compared to the mission lifetime , and iii ) less uncertainty in lens mass determination , as the expected event duration is independent of the lens distance . on the other hand ,",
    "disadvantages of distant source observation with vera are : i ) small number of sources compared to stars in the galaxy , and ii ) possible structural variation of the sources which could cause an apparent position shift of sources .    as for the first disadvantage ( shortage of sources ) , it is true that the number of radio sources is fairly small compared to the number of visible stars in the galaxy .",
    "for instance , the number of compact radio sources that are expected to be observable with vera is around 2000 ( e.g. , ma et al . 1998 , peck & beasley 1998 ) .",
    "moreover , the number density of compact sources in the galactic plane is smaller than that in the off - plane region , since surveys of compact sources are conducted mainly in the off - plane regions ( e.g. , patnaik et al .",
    "1992 ; peck & beasley 1998 ) .",
    "thus , in order to have a sufficient number of sources , one has to conduct a survey in the galactic plane region ( e.g. , honma et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "however , even at this stage there exist some sources which can be used for astrometric microlensing search . for instance",
    ", there is a radio source only 0.7@xmath107 away from the galactic center ( backer & sramek 1999 ; reid et al .",
    "also , according to lazio & cordes ( 1998 ) there are at least five extra - galactic radio sources within a few degrees from the galactic center ( including the one 0.7@xmath107 away from the galactic center ) .",
    "properties of the five sources are listed in table 3 , including event rates for disk lens and bulge lens cases .",
    "the event rates for disk lens cases vary from @xmath125 to @xmath126 event / yr , and the total event rate for the five sources is found to be @xmath127 event / yr . hence , even if one monitors only these five sources , one would detect an astrometric microlensing event caused by a disk star within 25 yr . the event rate for bulge lens",
    "is also quite high , varying from 2.8 to 4.7 @xmath53 event per year . if the bulge event rate is included , the total event rate for the five sources is @xmath128 event / yr , indicating that within 16 years at least one of the sources is being lensed by bulge or disk star .",
    "note that these five sources are located in about @xmath129 area around the galactic center ( see figure 2 in lazio & cordes 1998 ) .",
    "if the same number density applies to the rest of the galactic plane , one can expect to find fairly large number of radio sources ( i.e. , a few tens ) .",
    "therefore , the shortage of sources can be resolved by further search for radio sources in the galactic plane .    as to the second disadvantage ( qso structure variation ) , it is not easy to distinguish the structure effect and astrometric microlensing within a short period . however , the image trajectory of an astrometric microlensing is a perfect circle for most cases except for events with extremely small impact parameter . on the other hand ,",
    "it is unlikely that an image motion caused by the structure variation becomes a perfect circle .",
    "hence , if one monitors the source position for the full event duration , one can easily discriminate the structural effect and astrometric microlensing ( but of course there is no way to separate both effects if the two effects simultaneously happen to one source , and to avoid this it is better not to observe sources with significant structure variation ) .",
    "in conclusion , astrometric microlensing events due to stars are practically detectable based on the observation of distant radio sources with vera .",
    "if such events are detected , one can estimate the lens mass , and this will probably brings us new information on the stellar mass function at the lower end . according to the event rate calculation presented in the previous sections , it is not easy to detect an event , but it is possible if one monitors a few tens of sources for a decade or so .",
    "although this is time - consuming , it is a worthwhile study when one considers its scientific importance .",
