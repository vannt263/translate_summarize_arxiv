    "the awesome statistics of the four lep collaborations have pinned down with great precision a host of measurable parameters in the standard model@xcite . the only quantity that shows a possible significant discrepancy with the theoretical prediction of the standard model is @xmath0 which is defined as @xmath6 using @xmath7 gev and @xmath8 gev",
    ", the standard model predicts that @xmath9 , whereas lep obtained @xmath10 if the similarly defined @xmath11 is assumed to be independent . if the latter is fixed at its standard - model value , then @xmath12 . in either case , the excess is about @xmath13 . if this is taken seriously , physics beyond the standard model is indicated .",
    "the simplest extension of the standard model is to have two higgs doublets instead of just one .",
    "the relevance of this model to @xmath0 was studied in detail already a few years ago@xcite . to establish notation ,",
    "let the two higgs doublets be given by @xmath14.\\ ] ] let @xmath15 , then @xmath16 note that the @xmath17 and @xmath18 couplings involve the ratio @xmath19 , hence they could be important for large values of @xmath20 .",
    "it was shown@xcite that for @xmath21 , the @xmath0 excess peaks at about 4% near @xmath22 gev for @xmath23 .",
    "however , since @xmath24 is not observed , @xmath25 is a necessary constraint .",
    "we show in fig .  1 the contours in the @xmath26 plane for 3 values of @xmath0 .",
    "it is clear that relatively light scalar bosons are required if the @xmath0 excess is to be explained .",
    "ucrhep - t144 + tri - pp-95 - 16 + april 1995    psfig    for @xmath27 lighter than @xmath28 and having an enhanced coupling to @xmath29 , the decay @xmath30 becomes nonnegligible@xcite . as an illustration",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "2 the branching ratios of these two decays as functions of @xmath31 with the constraint @xmath32 gev so that a reasonable fit to the @xmath0 excess is obtained .",
    "it is seen that the sum of these two branching ratios is at least of order @xmath5 .",
    "once produced , @xmath33 or @xmath34 decays predominantly into @xmath4 as well .",
    "hence this scenario for explaining @xmath0 can be tested at lep if the sensitivity for identifying a @xmath4 pair as coming from @xmath33 or @xmath34 in @xmath35 final states can be pushed down below @xmath5 .",
    "in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , there are two higgs doublets , but their parameters are further constrained , hence the allowed region in the @xmath26 plane which gives a large enough @xmath0 is further reduced by the experimental nonobservation of mssm signals at lep@xcite .",
    "there is of course another possible contribution to @xmath0 in the mssm : the @xmath36 vertex may be enhanced by the supersymmetric coupling of @xmath37 to a scalar top quark and a chargino@xcite . in this case , both of the new particles must again be light , but now @xmath38 can not decay into just one of these particles because of the assumed conservation of @xmath39 parity , hence no further constraint is obtainable at lep .",
    "since @xmath37 is involved in any enhanced coupling to light particles in explaining the @xmath0 excess , its doublet partner @xmath40 must necessarily have the same enhanced coupling to related particles .",
    "in the two - higgs - doublet case , we must have an enhanced @xmath41 coupling . therefore ,",
    "unless @xmath42 , the branching ratio of @xmath43 will dominate over all others .",
    "in particular , the standard @xmath44 branching ratio will be seriously degraded .",
    "we show in fig .  3 the branching ratio @xmath45 as a function of @xmath46 .",
    "large values of @xmath46 are disfavored in this scenario because the splitting with @xmath33 and @xmath34 would result in a large contribution to the @xmath47 parameter@xcite .",
    "this poses a problem for top production at the tevatron because the number of observed top events is consistent with the assumption that top decays into @xmath48 100% of the time .",
    "if that is not so , then top production must be enhanced by a large factor beyond that of the standard model .",
    "the two - higgs - doublet model itself certainly does not provide for any such mechanism .    in the mssm ,",
    "if the @xmath0 excess is attributed to a light scalar top quark and a light chargino , then we should look at the latter s doublet partner which is in general a linear combination of neutralino mass eigenstates .",
    "at least one of these , _",
    "i.e. _ the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , will be light enough to allow the top quark to decay into it and the scalar top .",
    "the @xmath47 parameter also serves to disfavor large neutralino masses in this scenario .",
    "hence the @xmath44 branching ratio is again seriously degraded .",
    "turning the argument around , this means that for every observed top event , there must be several others which correspond to the production of supersymmetric particles .",
    "if the @xmath0 excess is really due to supersymmetry , top decay is the place to discover it !",
    "if the @xmath0 excess at lep is real and we want to explain it in terms of renormalizable loop corrections , then light particles are unavoidable .",
    "however , these light particles may be produced also in @xmath38 decay such as in the two - higgs - doublet case , where @xmath49 is at least of order @xmath5 in branching ratio .",
    "more importantly , there is necessarily a corresponding top decay into one of these light particles ( such as the scalar top in the mssm ) and the other particle s doublet partner ( the neutralino ) , which seriously degrades the @xmath44 branching ratio . unless there is accompanying new physics which enhances the top production by a large factor at the tevatron , this generic explanation of the @xmath0 excess in terms of light particles",
