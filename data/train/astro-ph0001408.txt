    "transformations between the theoretical and the observational planes are fundamental tools to compare stellar evolution models with observed color  magnitude diagrams . in order to calibrate suitable relations among colors , temperatures and bolometric corrections ( bcs ) several basic ingredients are needed :    * homogeneous and complete grids of stellar spectra ( observed and/or theoretical ) ; * accurate filter profiles ; * reference spectra ( the sun , vega etc . ) to set the zero points of the relations ; * suitable routines to interpolate within the grids and to integrate along the spectra .",
    "these calibrations are certainly model dependent and systematic shifts between different scales are common features .",
    "the goal of this paper is to obtain color  temperature relations and bcs in the hst ",

    "we also derive analogous transformations for a few selected filters in the wfpc2 system to provide homogeneous , self  consistent color  temperature relations and bcs when combinations of optical  infrared colors are used . a more complete calibration of the color  temperature transformations in the wfpc2 system can be found in the paper by holtzman et al .",

    ". in sect .  3 and 4 we discuss the transformations in the hst  nicmos and the wfpc2 systems , respectively . in sect .  5 we derive suitable relations to transform a few selected colors and bcs from the hst to the ground  based photometric system . in sect",

    "the ground  based bvijhk filter profiles are in the johnson s ( 1966 ) photometric system and were taken from buser & kurucz ( 1978 ) ( bv filters ) and from bruzual ( 1983 ) ( ijhk filters ) ( see also sect .  5 in leitherer & heckman 1995 for more details ) . the selected broadband filters in the hst ",

    "the filter profiles have been multiplied by the wavelength dependent detector quantum efficiency of the four wfpc2 and the three nicmos cameras .",
    "we used the most updated post ",
    "launch throughput curves and ccd quantum efficiencies , according to the wfpc2 and nicmos documentation on the web .",
    "the quoted nicmos throughput curves are already empirically adjusted to match standard star measurements ( the correction factors are less than 10% in the case of the f110w and f160w filters and about 25% for the f222 m one ) .",
    "we do not apply any further empirical adjustment to these response curves .",
    "the colors have been normalized assuming 0.00 values in all passbands for a vega  like star with @xmath0=9500k , log@xmath1=4.0 and [ fe / h]=0.5 ( cf . e.g. bcp98 ) .",

    "different assumptions for the colors and bolometric corrections of vega and sun like stars can be accounted for by simply scaling the inferred quantities by the corresponding amounts .    in order to quantify the influence of the adopted filter response curves on the inferred colors",
    "we also compare our b  v and v  k values with those in table 2 of bcp98 for solar metallicity .",

    "pure blackbodies have systematically bluer colors than model atmospheres , especially at the coolest temperatures , as expected from the omission of molecular opacities .",
    "this means that for a given color , blackbodies are cooler than the model atmospheres .",
    "analogous color  temperature relations using the lcb97 models have been obtained . in fig .  2 we report the difference of the color  temperature transformations in the nic2 system , by adopting the bcp98 or the lcb97 model atmospheres .",
    "at temperatures below @xmath65000  k the infrared colors using the lcb97 models get progressively bluer ( up to 0.20.3  mag ) than those using the bcp98 models .",
    "this behavior mainly reflects the difference between the original and corrected grids of model atmospheres by lcb97 . comparing their figs .",

    "a similar comparison can be done between the original and the _ corrected _ ( j  k ) ground based color : the latter becomes bluer with decreasing temperature by about 0.2 and up to 0.3 mag for giants and dwarfs at t@xmath7=3500  k , respectively .",
    "the un  corrected lcb97 models , from the original grids of atmosphere spectra by kurucz , should provide colors more similar to those obtained from the bcp98 models .",
    "color  temperature transformations in the nic1 and nic3 systems are also provided , as shown in fig .",
    "3 . regardess the model atmosphere used and the adopted stellar parameters , for a given temperature the ( f110w  f160w ) color in the nic1 system is only @xmath80.01  mag redder than in the nic2 system , while both the ( f110w  f160w ) and the ( f110w  f222 m ) colors in the nic3 system are slightly redder ( @xmath80.03  mag below @xmath64000  k ) .    in fig .  4 we plot the bc in the nic2 f110w , f160w and f222 m passbands as a function of the temperature using the bcp98 models .",
    "increasing the temperature of the stellar atmospheres , progressively larger corrections ( that is smaller values of the bc ) to the infrared fluxes have to be applied in order to get the bolometric luminosity .",
    "the scatter in the inferred quantities for different gravities and metallicities is generally small . at low temperatures",
    "the use of pure blackbodies requires larger corrections than using model atmospheres , as expected since the former have bluer spectra than the latter .    in fig .",
    "5 we plot the difference between the values of the bc in the nic2 photometric system , adopting the bcp98 or the lcb97 models , as we did for the colors in fig .  2 .",
    "at temperatures below 5000  k , larger bc values in the f110w and f222 m and smaller ones in the f160w passbands ( up to @xmath80.2  mag at @xmath0=3500  k ) are required when lcb97 models are used compared to the bcp98 ones .",
    "the above trends are almost independent of the adopted metallicity .    for a given set of model atmospheres , very similar bcs within @xmath90.01  mag",
    "are also obtained in the nic1 and nic3 systems , as shown in fig .",
    "6 . only in the f110w passband",
    "we find that the bc values in the nic3 system are slightly smaller ( @xmath80.02  mag ) than in the nic2 system .",
    "our discussion on the behavior of the inferred colors and bolometric corrections with varying the stellar parameters has been limited to the low temperature domain ( t@xmath105000  k ) where they are more sensitive . at higher temperatures",
    "these infrared quantities become progressively less dependent on the adopted model atmospheres .",
    "in fig .  7 we plot the ( f439w  f555w ) and ( f555w  f814w ) color  temperature transformations in the hst  pc1 system , using the bcp98 models for the three gravities and two metallicities of fig .  1 .",
    "the scatter among models with different log@xmath1 and @xmath5 is @xmath80.1  mag at all temperatures in the case of the ( f555w  f814w ) color , while at low temperatures ( @xmath115000  k ) the scatter among models with different gravities in the ( f439w  f555w ) color increases up to about 0.6  mag at @xmath0=3500  k , while the metallicity dependence is less critical .",

    "the ( f555w  f814w ) color becomes rapidly redder ( particularly at low gravities ) than the corresponding quantities using the bcp98 models for t@xmath124000  k. this behavior has little metallicity dependence . as for the infrared colors ,",
    "this behavior can be mainly ascribed to the corrections applied by lcb97 to the original model atmospheres . comparing again their figs .",

    "14,15 ( the corresponding corrected models ) one can see that below 4000  k the _ corrected _ ground  based ( b  v ) color of giants becomes bluer and slightly redder for dwarfs , while the ground  based ( v  i ) color becomes rapidly redder ( a few tenths of mag , even larger values for giants ) .    in fig .",
    "9 we plot the bc in the f439w , f555w and f814w passbands as a function of the temperature using the bcp98 models .",
    "the required bc values using pure blackbodies are on average slightly larger than using model atmospheres , as expected since the former have bluer spectra than the latter and , contrary to the infrared case , in the visual range they tend to be brighter than the model atmospheres .    in fig .",
    "10 we plot the difference between the values of the bc , adopting the bcp98 or the lcb97 models , as we did in fig .  8 for colors . at temperatures below 5000  k ,",

    "the above trends are sensitive to the adopted gravity and almost independent of metallicity .    for a given set of model atmospheres , very similar color ",
    "temperature transformations and bc ( within 0.01 mag ) are obtained in all four wfpc2 cameras .",
    "model atmospheres are a powerful tool to calibrate suitable color  temperature transformations since homogeneous and complete grids for a wide range of stellar parameters are available . nevertheless , for some specific applications empirical scales even if they are less complete in terms of stellar parameters are preferred .",
    "using the bcp98 model atmospheres , we calibrated average relations to transform several representative colors and bcs from the hst to the ground  based photometric system where most of the empirical scales are calibrated ( cf .",
    "montegriffo et al .",
    "1998 and references therein ) .",

    "the derived transformations are practically metallicity and gravity independent and very similar relations can be obtained adopting a particular metallicity or gravity .",
    "a cubic polynomial relation is required to transform the ( f110w  f160w ) into the ground  based ( j  h ) color , while a simple linear relation allows one to transform ( f110w  f222 m ) into the ground  based ( j  k ) color . very small ( @xmath90.01  mag ) global _",
