    "the demand for increasing the integrated density devices has led to the emergency of a whole generation devices based on confined structures .",
    "the mos transistor is the archetype of a confined two - dimensional system @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the possibility to enhance this confinement by embedding low - dimensional structures in an insulating matrix has opened new way for further downscaling .",
    "compared to the standard bulk technology , the corresponding devices based in these structures have increased the structural and conceptual complexity . these structures ( quantum dots , wires or layers ) can be used in single - electron devices @xcite , new memory concepts @xcite and photon or electroluminescent devices @xcite . concerning single electron devices ,",
    "they are currently conceived to take advantage of tunnel current between quantum states belonging to nanoscale particles @xcite .",
    "the single - electron devices based on qds appear to be potential candidates to improve , to complete or even to replace the current mos technology with which they may remain compatible . in order to be able to asses the potentials and capabilities of the various novel devices , a realistic theoretical estimate of the specific device performance",
    "is thus highly desirable . within this context",
    ", the simulations of such devices must be performed not only to understand but also to predict experimental behaviors . moreover , from a physical point of view we will learn a lot from these simulations if they are independent on high - level experimental parameters ( as tunneling rates , defective interfaces ... ) and are based on low - level concrete ones ( geometrical data , barrier height ... ) .    concerning quantum dots ( qds ) , they are particularly attractive because they possess discrete energy levels and quantum properties similar to natural atoms or molecules due to the strong confinement in all three directions .",
    "this fact affects dramatically the electronic transport properties . until now",
    ", research has mostly concentrated on single qds and many novel transport phenomena have been discovered , such as the staircaselike current - voltage ( i - v ) characteristic @xcite , coulomb blockade oscillation @xcite , negative differential capacitance @xcite and the kondo effect @xcite .    from experimental point of view ,",
    "rapid progress in microfabrication technology has made possible coupling quantum dots system with aligned levels @xcite .",
    "in fact , the use of the coulomb blockade phenomenon in systems made up of combinations of tunnel junctions and semiconductor qds seems to offer promising perspectives , in particular in non - volatile memory applications and also for single - electron transistor @xcite .",
    "moreover , the concept of multi - dot memory using semiconductor nanocrystals embedded in an insulator matrix as floating - gate has already been demonstrated @xcite and the quantization effects have been used in self - aligned double - stacked memory to improve the retention time @xcite .    from a theoretical perspective , researchers have recently paid much attention to electron transport through several qds , since multiple qd provides more feynman paths for the electron transmission @xcite .",
    "the complexity of structure and physical mechanism as well as the prominent role of dimensional and quantum effects characterizing the operation of these novel qds devices preclude the use of standard macroscopic bulk semiconductor transport theory .",
    "many authors have studied the electron transport using negff @xcite , taking into account the potential due to the self - charge .",
    "however , up to now nobody has done a computation of transport in an extended arbitrary array of qds using this framework since this approach is usually unfeasible to implement for large systems . on the other hand , rate equation type models used for lasers or light - emitting diodes often offer a satisfactory description of the charge transport . moreover , this approach presents a more transparent vision of the electron transport .",
    "thus , this model is easier to tinker with , in order to deal with more complicated nanostructures based on quantum dots .    in this work ,",
    "we present in full a model based in non - coherent rate equations @xcite , which is suitable to study the electron transport in qd arrays . in a previous work @xcite , a preliminary version of this methodology",
    "was presented and used to obtain analytical solutions for electron transport in simple cases .",
    "the methodology was also compared with non - equilibrium green s function calculations , obtaining favorable results @xcite : despite the simplicity of the model , it provided good results and it was also easily scalable .",
    "now , a complete model to simulate devices based in qd arrays is presented . the theoretical formalism and the assumptions made in the model",
    "are thoroughly described .",
    "the interaction between qds , and between these and the leads has been introduced by transition rates and capacitive couplings .",
    "the local potential effects were computed self - consistently .",
    "inelastic and back scattering effects were neglected . concerning the transition rates ,",
    "the use of ab initio calculations is shown to be the best way to fully understand the underlaying tunneling physics in nanostructures .",
    "however , if first - principles calculations for single tunnel events were implemented , the huge effort required would make the simulation time increase in an unacceptable manner .",
    "this impractical computational time , forced us to write a compact model with some assumptions and relaxing the expectation of accuracy when treating with few - electron devices operating through quantum features . specifically , we used the one - dimensional wkb approximation , which neglects spatial variation of the wavefunction over the non - transport directions to describe the tunnel processes .",
    "the hole transport was also introduced obtaining new current terms and realistic expressions for the capacity in bipolar conduction .",
    "details about the implementation of the model in the simqdot code are also given .",
    "this implementation was used to simulate two examples of practical implementations of qd - based devices : an arbitrary array of qds operated in conductometric mode and a qd transistor device with an additional gate electrode .",
    "as in any device simulation , the ultimate goal of the present approach is to predict the response of a device of one specific architecture ( geometry , material ... ) to a given variation in the external conditions ( bias voltage ) via the solution of the dynamical equations .",
    "first of all , we are going to describe the device architecture and after , we write the underlying equations .",
    "[ primera](a ) shows the basic building blocks of our device , which are in essence an insulator layer sandwiched between two metallic electrodes . inside the insulator layer a random distribution of n quantum dots ( qds )",
    "can be inserted .",
    "this is the classical structure that is obtained due to the fabrication processes , a superlattice of insulator - semiconductor bilayers .",
    "although single qd contacted to the leads has been obtained creating a so called single electron transistor ( set ) @xcite , the research mainstream is focused on the properties of structures with many qds to create non - volatile memories @xcite , light - emitting devices @xcite or solar cells devices @xcite .    due to the fabrication processes ,",
    "the insulator thickness is large enough to avoid direct tunneling between the electrodes ( or leads ) . therefore , the electron current needs to pass trough the qds .",
    "thus , a correct modelization of the tunneling processes among the qds and qds - electrodes is needed .",
    "these tunneling processes can be described by tunnel junctions composed by a capacitance and a current source that depends on the voltage drop .",
    "this tunnel junctions network is represented in fig .",
    "[ primera](b ) .",
    "a usual method employed to describe the tunneling processes in devices is the tunneling hamiltonian approach ( also called transfer hamiltonian approach ) .",
    "this theory , thoroughly studied by many authors @xcite , treats the tunnelling events as a perturbation .",
    "the matrix coefficient @xmath0 quantifies the probability for a particle to transfer from a state of the left side of the barrier to a state of the right side by a tunnel process .",
    "the tunneling rate is determined using time - dependent perturbation theory by considering the electron from one side of the barrier as initial state and the electron on the other side as a final state .",
    "the tunneling rate from the left to the right states ( both are considered as a part of a continuum ) can be calculated using the fermi s golden rule @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the density of states of the left and right side . from this expression",
    ", we can see that we only consider ballistic transport .",
    "this means that the electron does not suffer energy loss scattering processes when it moves through the barrier .",
    "introducing the energy distribution function in each part of the barrier we can evaluate the total tunneling rate from all occupied states on the left to all unoccupied states on the right @xcite @xmath4 \\rho_r(e_r ) \\delta(e_r - e_l ) de_r \\right\\ } de_l.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the opposite tunneling rate can be calculated in a similar way .",
    "thus , the net tunneling current @xmath5 $ ] assuming symmetry in the transmission coefficient @xmath6 @xcite can be written as @xmath7de,\\ ] ] where we introduce a factor 2 to take into account the spin . therefore , using this approach we can describe the whole system as independent subsystems ( the qds ) connected between them by a transmission probability through the dielectric media .",
    "thus , this methodology allows us to write the currents between the different parts of the system .    in the above expressions , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the non - equilibrium energy distribution functions in each side of the barrier .",
    "these distributions functions take into account how the energy levels are filled ( @xmath8 ) or emptied ( @xmath10 ) , as it is expected the electron transport only occurs if the initial state is filled and the final state is empty ( see eq .",
    "( [ dos ] ) ) .",
    "however , the distribution function of each part of the system is unknown . assuming that the distribution functions of the electrodes ( left l and right r electrodes ) are well described by the equilibrium fermi dirac statistics using modified electrochemical potentials , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the applied bias voltage , the problem is reduced to find the non - equilibrium distributions functions of each qd ( @xmath13 ) .    from the definition of the total charge @xmath14 inside the @xmath15qd",
    "can be expressed as : @xmath16 here , we are going to redefine the notation used to describe the distribution functions .",
    "the distribution function for each qd is @xmath13 while we reserve @xmath9 and @xmath8 for the distribution function of the left and right leads respectively .",
    "we can write the evolution charge in time for each qd as @xmath17 . where the subscript @xmath18 takes into account all the elements that are linked to the @xmath15qd .",
    "thus , from eq .",
    "( [ cuatro ] ) we can write the evolution of charge in time as a function of the total net current flux for each qd .",
    "this set of integro - differential equations have a similar form as a usual rate equations . in the following , the different current terms and the elements that appear in eq .",
    "( [ tres ] ) are going to be discussed .",
    "since the evolution charge in time of each qd can be written as a function of the net current flux , it is needed to determine all the current contributions .",
    "the current contributions can be of two types , the qds have leads contributions and also neighbors qd current contributions .",
    "these two types of current have the same form in eq .",
    "( [ tres ] ) , but in each case we need to use the correct distribution function .    from the point of view of the nature of these contributions",
    ", we have three different processes @xcite . in fig .  [ segunda ]",
    "we show an scheme of the different tunneling processes .",
    "the first term corresponds to electron tunneling from conduction band to conduction band ( ecb ) .",
    "the second one is an electron tunneling from valence band to conduction band ( evb ) .",
    "since the transmission coefficients are symmetric , this process also involves the inverse case , tunneling from conduction band to valence band .",
    "the last process is related to the holes : hole tunneling from valence band to valence band ( hvb ) .",
    "one important point is how we treat the distinction between electrons and holes . from a physical point of view",
    ", the hole conduction can be viewed as electron conduction restricted to the valence band .",
    "therefore , we can consider only electron transport but taking into account the conduction and valence band contributions to the current .",
    "thus , we only need to consider the changing number of electrons in these two bands .",
    "therefore , the time charge evolution equations for each qd can be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 and we take into account all the contributions for an arbitrary @xmath15qd .",
    "the first pair of elements are related to the left lead contribution , the electron and the hole contributions . for simplicity",
    ", we assume infinite metallic leads therefore we only write the continuum dos of the leads ( @xmath2 ) meanwhile in the qd we write the dos in separately terms , conduction ( @xmath21 ) and valence ( @xmath22 ) bands .",
    "similar contribution is obtained for the right lead . in these two contributions we use the fermi dirac distribution function to describe the leads with @xmath23 electrochemical potentials . in each current term",
    ", we use the appropriate transmission coefficient .",
    "the last two pairs of current terms represent the current from the neighbor qds .",
    "the subscript j runs over all the qds except the qd that we are considering . in these terms",
    "we take into account the different processes , tunneling from the conduction band ( cb ) to conduction band ( cb ) and tunneling from valence band ( vb ) to valence band ( vb ) .",
    "we also need to describe the tunneling that mix the bands ( evb processes ) in two ways , from cb to vb and from vb to cb .",
    "as it is easy to see , these processes can not occur at the same time but it is important to take both into account .",
    "the set of equations , eq .",
    "( [ cinco ] ) , can be solved for the steady state . under our assumption that there is no inelastic scattering ,",
    "the system can be written in a matrix form and solved for each energy step to obtain the non - equilibrium distribution function for each qd ( @xmath13 ) .      from eq .",
    "( [ uno ] ) the transmission coefficient @xmath24 is defined as the tunnel probability of the electrons pass through the dielectric media .",
    "the tunneling probability is a strong function of the parallel component to the junction interface energy @xmath25 . at each particular total energy e ,",
    "the dos with a zero @xmath25 component is heavily weighted by the tunneling probability in eq .",
    "( [ tres ] ) .",
    "therefore the dos only takes into account states with @xmath26 .",
    "this approximation may in part be a justification for ignoring the tunneling electron momentum in eq .",
    "( [ dos ] ) @xcite .    under our assumptions",
    ", we use the semiclassical and one - dimension wkb approximation @xcite for the transmission coefficient @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the classical turning points , @xmath31 is the effective dielectric mass and @xmath32 is the potential barrier of the dielectric material .",
    "this barrier is the difference between the bands of the qd and the dielectric matrix .",
    "the transmission coefficients have been derived taking into account the effect of the electric field in the interface , @xmath33 .",
    "the transmission coefficient can be separated in three regions , for incident electrons with less energy than the modified height of the barrier we use a direct tunnel expression .",
    "this expression considers that the electrons see a trapezoidal potential barrier .",
    "when the incident electrons have energies between the modified height and the total barrier height we use the fowler - nordheim expression in which , the electrons see a triangular potential barrier . finally , for incident electrons with energy greater than the barrier we do not assume scattering , therefore , we assign @xmath34 .",
    "this last case corresponds to elastic transport trough the conduction band of the dielectric and only occurs for large bias voltages .",
    "the transmission coefficient can be written as @xmath35 the electric field is defined as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the potential barrier height , @xmath38 is the modified potential barrier height , @xmath39 is the tunneling distance , @xmath40 is @xmath41 times the electrostatic potential between the two elements and @xmath42 is the work function difference . in fig .",
    "[ tercera ] an scheme of the barrier is shown under external polarization .    in a similar way the transmission coefficients for the holes can be derived . in that case , the potential barrier is the difference between the valence bands of the qd and the dielectric .      as a first order approximation",
    ", we propose a simplified model to represent the discrete energy levels in the qds .",
    "we treat each qd as a finite spherical potential well .",
    "the height of the well is the difference between the conduction band energy level of the dielectric matrix and the one of the material that forms the qd .    solving the spherical schrodinger equation inside the well for @xmath43 we obtain the typical binding states @xcite .",
    "the number of binding states and their energetically position depend on the height of the well @xmath44 , the radius @xmath45 and the electron effective mass @xmath46 and @xmath31 ( mass inside the qd and in the dielectric media , respectively ) .",
    "imposing continuity of the wavefunction and its first derivate in @xmath47 the equation that determine the bounding states are @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this equation can be solved using a newton - raphson algorithm that gives us a discrete energy levels @xmath51 . since in the schrodinger equation the zero energy origin",
    "is located at the bottom of the well , we need to shift the energy @xmath51 in order to have a common fermi level .",
    "obtaining @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the number of bounding states in the @xmath15 qd .",
    "the value of @xmath54 is half the size of the bulk material gap where we assume the fermi level is placed .",
    "now , we define @xmath55 . similar treatment is done for the valence band to the qd vb binding states .    up to now we treated each qd as an independent part of the system , but",
    "the qds are coupled between them .",
    "this effect is introduced assuming a broadening of the discrete energy levels of the qds .",
    "the standard way to introduce the broadening of the energy levels as a consequence of contacts is to assign a lorentzian shape to each discrete energy level @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the broadening of the level and it is related with the tunnel probabilities . therefore , the total density of states ( dos ) for each qd is the total sum of the energy levels taking into account the cb and vb binding states @xmath58 we have used a simplified model in order to describe the dos structure of the qds but the proposed approach allows to use more complicated dos obtained using ab initio models .",
    "therefore , this model is suitable for several materials and an atomistic description of qds , as we will show in forthcoming papers .      up to now",
    "we have only computed the distribution function of electrons inside each qd , but the changing in this functions will result into change in the local potential in each qd ( @xmath59 ) . as we can see in fig .",
    "[ primera](b ) each junction is modeled as a current tunnel junction in parallel with a capacity .",
    "these capacities represent the electrostatic influence between the different parts of the system .",
    "therefore , each qd has a local potential due to the applied bias voltage .",
    "since each qd can be charged we need to solve the poisson equation @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the relative permittivity of the dielectric media and @xmath62 is the qd volume .",
    "@xmath63 is the change in the number of electrons , calculated respect to the number of electrons @xmath64 initially in the @xmath15qd .",
    "the potential energy of each qd is @xmath65 .",
    "the inclusion of the charge term takes into account the carrier interaction inside each qd .",
    "the result of this approach corresponds to the hartree - term , i.e. first approximation of the carrier - carrier interaction using a mean - field level treatment @xcite .",
    "the general solution of the potential energy of the @xmath15qd involves the different capacitive coupling between it and its surrounding and its charge increasing @xcite , and it can be written as @xmath66 where the subscript @xmath18 runs over all the components of the system , @xmath67 is the capacitive coupling between the different components and @xmath68 is the total capacitive coupling of @xmath15qd .",
    "the charge energy constant @xmath69 is the potential increase as a consequence of the injection of one electron into the qd .",
    "( [ pot ] ) are a set of equations ( one equation per dot ) and the first term of eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) , the laplace term @xmath70 , can be written in a matrix form as : @xmath71.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the first term of the previous equation is the electrostatic influence of the lead in which the bias voltage ( @xmath12 ) is applied meanwhile the second term is the electrostatic coupling with the neighbor qd .",
    "the neighbors capacitive matrix is defined as @xmath72 symmetric matrix with zero in the diagonal terms .",
    "both terms are multiplied by the inverse of the total qd capacity .",
    "the effects of the local potential on each qd should be computed in the qd dos @xmath73 shifting the position of the energy levels .",
    "this fact modifies the qd charge and the currents . in eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) we observe that the local potential depends on the increasing charge density but at the same time the charge depends on the dos that it is modified by the local potential .",
    "these considerations impose a selfconsistent solution of eq .",
    "( [ cuatro ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) .",
    "a realistic modelization of the capacitive coupling between the different parts of the systems @xcite is needed , since the electron needs available states in the qds in order to have transport and the dos of each qd depends of the local potential .",
    "therefore , the position of the energy levels with the applied bias voltage plays an important role in the determination of the i - v curve .",
    "we use the analytical relationship for a sphere to conducting plane capacitance to model the capacitance between the leads and the qd , which is @xmath74 where @xmath61 is the permittivity of the dielectric media , @xmath45 is the qd radius and @xmath75 is the distance between the plane and the center of the qd .    for the case of interdot capacitances ( @xmath76 )",
    "there is no analytical expression for the capacitance that takes into account qds of different radii .",
    "we use the numerical method of image charges to calculate interdot capacitance between qds of different sizes . in fig .",
    "[ cuarta ] we show the two capacitive terms as a function of the distance and for different qd radii .      since a simultaneous solution of set of equations eq .",

    "[ quinta ] we show the flowchart of the methodology .",
    "first of all , a correct description of the device and all the physical parameters are needed .",
    "then , a bias voltage is applied to the electrodes .",
    "the laplace potential ( @xmath77 ) is obtained and the transmission coefficients are evaluated .",
    "the qds dos are shifted and the system of eq .",
    "( [ cinco ] ) is solved for this local potential .",
    "the charge in each qd is computed ( @xmath14 ) and the solution of the poisson equation is obtained .",
    "an anderson s mixing @xcite is used in order to obtain the optimized local potential @xmath78 .",
    "the anderson s mixing has been implemented as follows : + while du@xmath791 * 10e-9 + @xmath80 + @xmath81 + @xmath82 + @xmath83 + @xmath84 + @xmath85 + @xmath86 + @xmath87 + @xmath88 + du = max(*du * ) + @xmath80 + end + all the bold used variables are vectors except @xmath89 and du , which are scalars .",

    "the methodology has been explained in depth to able the interested reader to creates his own code and reproduce the following results .",
    "however , implementation of the code for specific devices is available @xcite .",
    "the previous formalism has been implemented in matlab taking advantage its advantageous matrix - oriented syntax .",
    "the general strategy behind the code is presented below .",
    "first , the qds are distributed randomly inside the insulator matrix imposing two conditions : 1 ) no overlapping between qds is allowed and 2 ) the qds must lie entirely in the insulator .",
    "these conditions ensure real and positive capacitive values .    in a second stage ,",
    "a loop is created in order to solve the problem at each voltage point .",
    "all the parameters that depend on the applied voltages are calculated ( i.e. transmission coefficients ) and the set of equations is created . the eq .",
    "( [ cinco ] ) are solved using the moore - penrose pseudoinverse matrix method , since the eq .",
    "( [ cinco ] ) matrix might not always be directly invertible .",
    "the charges are calculated and the anderson mixing is used .",
    "this process is repeated until the desired convergence is achieved .    in",
    "a final staged part , the outputs ( qd occupancy vs. voltage , current vs. voltage , local potential vs. voltage ) are calculated for each voltage point and saved in a matrix structure .    in fig .",
    "[ decima ] we show the computational time needed to obtain results for one voltage point as a function of the number of qds .",
    "the computational time grows with the number of qds but it is still reasonable and allows to simulate large qd arrays .",
    "moreover , matlab allows to execute the code in parallel .",
    "therefore , the simulations can be run in a parallel cluster decreasing further the computational time .",
    "in the following , the information provided by the previous formalism will be illustrated studying two different generic devices based on qds : ( 1 ) a random distributed array of silicon ( si ) qds embedded in a silicon dioxide ( @xmath95 ) insulator matrix placed among two electrodes , and ( 2 ) a similar structure but with a third electrode placed on top of the device , a transistor structure .",

    ". the electron transport takes place from the left electrode ( source ) to the right electrode ( drain ) through the qds . for a physical point of view , the most general condition in order to obtain transport is that the energy levels of the qds must lie between the electrochemical potentials of the leads ( @xmath11 ) , this condition can be summarized as @xmath96 . the type of transport will depend on the nature of these energy levels .",
    "we have considered all the tunnel current between the @xmath15 qd among its surrounding , but since the transmission coefficient is strongly dependent with the tunneling distance , some processes are more favored than others .",
    "therefore , other transport conditions appears . in order to have transport between the qds , overlapping of the qd dos",
    "is necessary .",
    "free states in the arriving qd are also needed .",
    "thus , the systems plays with the transmission probabilities between the different processes and the available states .",

    "first , we study a transistor with only one qd , and after we simulate a transistor with some qds .",
    "+ the scheme of the system is shown in fig .  [ septima](a ) .",
    "the current is represented as a function of the applied bias voltage ( drain - source voltage , @xmath12 ) and the gate voltage ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "the stability diagram of the transistor ( current curve ) and the accumulated charge in the qd are represented in fig .",
    "[ octava](a ) and fig .",
    "[ octava](b ) respectively . in order to have transport",
    ", the energy levels of the qd must lie between the electrochemical potential of the source and drain lead . in this device , this condition can be achieved as a combination of the applied bias voltage and the gate voltage .    for small @xmath110",
    "the current is blocked until the first energy level is placed between the electrochemical potentials as a result of the applied @xmath109 .",
    "for the @xmath111 case , the explanation is similar but in this case only @xmath12 contributes to the local potential .",
    "therefore , the current is blocked until the previous condition is achieved .",
    "this effect corresponds to the central diamond that it can be seen in the upper figure .",
    "the shape of the current diamonds is a result of the relationship between the different capacity values and the position of the energy levels .",
    "once an energy channel is open , the current increase dramatically as a result of the transmission coefficient that dominates the tunneling current .",
    "the obtained results are consistent with the results presented in @xcite .",
    "we also show the accumulated charge in the qd .",
    "the qd remains uncharged in a large region since the energy value of the conduction and valence energy levels are similar .",
    "therefore , the qd begins to charge when the electron transport is the dominant processes .",
    "if the hole conduction is preferred the qd losses its initial charge .",
    "this energy level symmetry is broken by the transmission coefficient at high @xmath12 . applying @xmath109 the charge in the qd",
    "is also changed .",
    "the physical process is different since @xmath109 moves upward / downward the energy levels across the electrochemical potentials of the leads and the qd losses / gains charge @xcite .",
    "+    once the transistor structure for one qd has been implemented , the extension of the previous formalism is straightforward to describe the electron transport in an array of qds .",
    "since there are many qds the electron has different pathways and the overlapping between the dos of the qds appears as a crucial point .",
    "moreover , the gate capacitive coupling depends of the distance between the qd and the gate and the gate influence in the local potential is not the same in all the qds",
    ". therefore , the evolution of the energy levels with the applied gate voltage varies opening / closing different conduction channels .",
    "the scheme of the simulated system and the corresponding current maps are represented in fig .",
    "[ novena](a)(b ) , respectively .",
    "the high efficiency concepts of the next generation of qds based devices pose new requirements on models for the theoretical description of their transport properties .",
    "an intuitive theoretical framework suitable for this purpose is available in the non coherent rate equations .",
    "this approach provides a simple and transparent method to describe the electron transport . using the transfer hamiltonian approach to describe the tunneling current terms in ballistic regime ,",
    "the rate equations can be used in order to obtain the non equilibrium distribution functions in each qd . the effect of self - charge has been taken into account solving the poisson equation with the appropriate boundary conditions for each qd that involve the capacity coupling between the different parts of the system and the accumulated charge in each qd . as expected ,",
    "the calculation of the local potential inside each qd is one of the most critical points , since the i - v curves depends on the position of the energy level .",
    "due to the simplicity of the model , this can be easily extended to analyze arbitrary large arrays of qds of interest in technological applications .    in order to simulate devices as realistic as possible ,",
    "suitable expressions for the transmission coefficients , the energy level positions and the capacitive coupling have been used .",
    "these parameters can be described using basic material properties and geometrical representations of the system . moreover ,",
    "the hole currents have been taken into account , obtaining a complete description of the electron transport in the structure .    finally , two prototypical structures have been simulated using realistic material parameters to describe an array of si qds embeeded in a @xmath95 insulator matrix .",
    "these structures compose the basic building blocks for future devices based in qds ans demonstrate the practicability of the here presented approach .",
