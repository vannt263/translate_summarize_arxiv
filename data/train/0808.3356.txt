    "the term  zero bias anomaly \" ( zba ) refers either to a peak in , or a suppression of , the density of states ( dos ) at the fermi energy . in disordered materials ,",
    "a zba arises from the interplay between disorder and interactions .",
    "zero bias anomalies were originally predicted to occur in strongly - disordered insulators by efros and shklovskii@xcite ( es ) and later in weakly - disordered metals by altshuler and aronov@xcite ( aa ) . in the limit of weak interactions and disorder ,",
    "aa showed that the exchange self - energy of the screened coulomb interaction produces a cusp - like minimum in the dos at the fermi energy . in the limit of strong disorder",
    ", es showed that the classical hartree self - energy of the unscreened coulomb interaction causes the dos to vanish at the fermi energy .",
    "experiments have shown a smooth evolution between the aa and es limits as a function of disorder,@xcite and it appears that the essential physics of the zba in conventional metals and insulators is well understood .    in this work , we are interested in anomalies which have been observed in a number of transition metal oxide materials , where the physics is less well understood",
    ". transition metal oxides often exhibit unconventional behavior because the physics of their valence band is dominated by strong short - ranged interactions whose effects can not generally be explained by conventional theories of metals and insulators .",
    "most notably , many transition metal oxides exhibit a mott transition when their valence band is half - filled . in disorder - free systems , the mott transition@xcite occurs between a gapless metallic state and a gapped insulating state , and is driven by a strong intraorbital coulomb interaction .",
    "the mott transition may occur as a function of any number of parameters,@xcite such as temperature@xcite or magnetic field,@xcite but more commonly occurs in transition - metal oxides as a result of chemical doping .",
    "a number of experiments@xcite have found that chemical doping introduces sufficient disorder that there is a regime between the mott - insulating and gapless phases that is characterized by a zba .",
    "this naturally raises the question of how the strong electron - electron correlations that are prevalent in the gapless phase near the mott transition affect the physics of the zba .",
    "the effect of strong correlations on the zba has received little attention.@xcite in large part , this is due to the difficulty of incorporating both strong correlations and disorder in a manageable theory .",
    "a number of calculations based on the unrestricted hartree - fock approximation ( hfa ) have been used to study the phase diagram of the disordered hubbard model.@xcite in these calculations , the disorder potential is treated exactly for finite - sized systems , but the intraorbital coulomb interaction is treated at the mean - field level and therefore neglects strong correlations .",
    "much of the recent progress has involved various formulations of dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) to include disorder at some level of approximation .",
    "coherent - potential - like approximations have been employed by a variety of authors.@xcite in these calculations , the local electron self - energy contains both inelastic contributions from the interactions and elastic contributions from the disorder - averaging process .",
    "it is well known that these kinds of disorder - averaging approximations capture many features of the dos but do not retain the nonlocal correlations responsible for the zba and can not , therefore , explain the experiments cited above.@xcite an extension of dmft , called statistical dmft , has been employed to study ensembles consisting of bethe lattices with random site energies .",
    "@xcite this represents an improvement over the disorder - averaged approximations in that the results depend nontrivially on the coordination number of the bethe lattice .",
    "very recently , the dmft equations have been solved by us on a two dimensional square lattice in a way which preserves spatial correlations between sites.@xcite the calculations employed a simple atomic - limit approximation for the self - energy that , while generally appropriate for the large - disorder limit , does not contain the off - diagonal self - energies responsible for the dos anomalies observed in experiments .    in this work ,",
    "we extend our earlier calculations to include a nearest neighbour interaction @xmath0 .",
    "this interaction is treated at the mean - field level , and serves two purposes in this work : first , it represents finite range interactions which are present in real materials .",
    "second , the exchange self - energy coming from this interaction plays a qualitatively similar role to the off - diagonal self - energy that is missing in our treatment of the intraorbital interaction @xmath1 .",
    "the intraorbital self - energy is calculated within a hubbard - i ( hi ) approximation which has the effect of suppressing double occupancy of orbitals .",
    "details of these calculations are outlined in sec .",
    "[ method ] .",
    "because the hi approximation is known to be defficient in the disorder - free limit , we include a discussion in sec .",
    "[ connection ] showing that the approximation for the diagonal self - energy is valid in the limit of large disorder and low coordination number . in sec .",
    "[ cpa ] , we introduce a coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) for the disordered hubbard model which is used as a point of comparison for the lattice dmft calculations . the results of numerical and analytical calculations are presented in sec .  [ results ] .",
    "our primary result is that the zba is strongly enhanced by electron correlations near half - filling when the interaction is finite - ranged .",
    "the zba is predominantly of the es type , in the sense that the largest contribution is from the classical hartree interaction between localized charges on neighboring sites .",
    "the enhancement of the zba at half - filling is due to strong correlations which inhibit screening of the impurity potential : near the mott transition , the absence of screening drives the system towards the strongly localized limit where the physics of the coulomb gap is most important .",
    "the magnitude of the zba is doping dependent , and drops off away from half - filling .",
    "we study an extended anderson - hubbard model , also known as a disordered @xmath2-@xmath1-@xmath0 model . in this model",
    ", @xmath2 denotes the electron kinetic energy , @xmath1 the intraorbital coulomb interaction , and @xmath0 the interaction between nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "the @xmath0-term in the hamiltonian can be used to represent two distinct physical processes .",
    "first , it represents the nonlocal coulomb interaction that , while neglected in the hubbard model , is generally present in real materials .",
    "second , as shown below , the exchange self - energy from the nonlocal interaction is qualitatively similar to the exchange self - energy that arises in a perturbative treatment of the hubbard model .",
    "this effective interaction plays a crucial role in clean low - dimensional systems.@xcite it is often treated explicitly in the large-@xmath1 limit via an approximate mapping of the hubbard model onto the @xmath2-@xmath3 model , where @xmath3 is the strength of the effective nonlocal interaction .",
    "a major difference between the @xmath2-@xmath3 and extended anderson - hubbard models is that double occupation of orbitals is completely suppressed in the former whereas a finite fraction of sites will be doubly occupied in the latter when the width of the disorder distribution is larger than @xmath1 .",
    "the extended anderson - hubbard model is @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes nearest - neighbor lattice sites @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and parameters @xmath2 , @xmath1 and @xmath0 are the kinetic energy , the on - site coulomb interaction , and the nearest - neighbor interaction respectively .",

    "since the pole energies are linear functions of @xmath10 , the total density of states is featureless at the fermi energy .",
    "next , we use the fact that the diagonal matrix elements of eq .  ( [ g ] ) can be written in the form @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the hybridization function that describes the coupling of site @xmath6 to the rest of the lattice .",
    "it is @xmath176 where @xmath177 are the matrix elements of @xmath26 between sites @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath178 is the green s function for the lattice with site @xmath6 removed , and the second line is the expansion of the first to @xmath179 . equation ( [ eq : di ] ) applies formally to the limit that the localization length vanishes , but is qualitatively correct for @xmath180 .",

    "the local charge susceptibility @xmath191 is nonzero because of the hybridization function @xmath175 .",
