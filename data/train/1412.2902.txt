    "the least action principle provides the foundation for classical mechanics and field theory .",
    "a distinguishing feature of the lagrangian equations of motion among other differential equations is that their solution space carries a natural symplectic structure , making it into a phase space .",
    "the physical observables , being identified with the smooth function(al)s on the phase space , are then endowed with the structure of a poisson algebra .",
    "there are at least two different ways for describing this poisson algebra .",
    "the first one is the standard hamiltonian formalism , which requires an explicit splitting of space - time into space and time and introduction of canonical momenta .",
    "the main drawback of this approach is the lack of manifest covariance , which causes some complications in applying it to relativistic field theory .",
    "an alternative approach was proposed by peierls in his seminal 1952 paper @xcite . in that paper",
    "he invented what is now known as the peierls brackets on the covariant phase space .",
    "in contrast to the usual ( non - covariant ) hamiltonian formalism , where the phase space is identified with the space of initial data , the covariant phase space is the functional space consisting of all the trajectories obeying the lagrangian equations of motion .",
    "peierls paper opened up the way for constructing a fully relativistic theory of quantum fields @xcite .",
    "for more recent discussions of the peierls brackets , on different levels of rigor , we refer the reader to @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we explain how to extend the concept of covariant phase - space to the most general ( i.e. , not necessarily lagrangian ) theories .",
    "our approach is based on the notion of lagrange anchor , which was originally proposed in @xcite as a tool for path - integral quantization of lagrangian and non - lagrangian theories . in most cases",
    "the existence of a lagrange anchor appears to be less restrictive condition for the classical dynamics than the existence of an action functional .",
    "furthermore , one and the same system of equations may admit a variety of different lagrange anchors leading to inequivalent quantizations .",
    "in the next sections , we will show that any lagrange anchor gives rise to a poisson structure in the space of solutions to the classical equations of motion .",
    "the corresponding poisson brackets are fully covariant and reduce to the peierls brackets in the case of lagrangian theories endowed with the canonical lagrange anchor .",
    "it is pertinent to note that for the mechanical systems described by ordinary differential equations in normal form , a relationship between the lagrange anchors and poisson brackets has been already established in @xcite .",
    "our exposition is mostly focused on the algebraic and geometric aspects of the construction , while more subtle functional analytical details are either ignored or treated in a formal way .",
    "these details , however , are not specific to our problem and can be studied , in principle , along the same lines as in the case of the conventional peierls brackets .",
    "in modern language the classical fields are just the sections of a locally trivial fiber bundle @xmath0 over the space - time manifold @xmath1 .",
    "the typical fiber @xmath2 of @xmath3 is called the target space of fields . in case",
    "the bundle is trivial , i.e. , @xmath4 , the fields are merely the mappings from @xmath1 to @xmath2 . in each trivializing coordinate chart",
    "@xmath5 a field @xmath6 is described by a collection of functions @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are local coordinates in @xmath2 .",
    "these functions are often called the components of the field @xmath10 .",
    "formally , one can think of @xmath11  the space of all field configurations  as a smooth manifold @xmath12 with the continuum infinity of dimensions and @xmath7 playing the role of local coordinates .",
    "in other words , the different local coordinates @xmath7 on @xmath12 are labeled by the space - time point @xmath13 and the discrete index @xmath14 . to emphasize this interpretation of fields",
    "as coordinates on the infinite - dimensional manifold @xmath12 we will include the space - time point @xmath15 into the discrete index @xmath14 and write @xmath9 for @xmath7 ; in so doing , the summation over the `` superindex '' @xmath14 implies usual summation for its discrete part and integration over @xmath1 for @xmath15 . in the physical literature",
    "this convention is known as dewitt s condensed notation @xcite .",
    "proceeding with the infinite - dimensional geometry above , we identify the `` smooth functions '' on the `` manifold '' @xmath12 with the infinitely differentiable functionals of field @xmath10 .",
    "these functionals form a commutative algebra , which will be denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "if @xmath17 is an infinitesimal variation of field , then , according to the condensed notation , the corresponding variation of a functional @xmath18 can be written in the form @xmath19 where the comma denotes the functional derivative .",
    "the concepts of vector fields , differential forms and exterior differentiation on @xmath12 are naturally introduced through the functional derivatives , see e.g. @xcite . in particular , the variations @xmath20 span the space of 1-forms and the functional derivatives @xmath21 define a basis in the tangent space @xmath22 .",
    "so , we can speak of the tangent and cotangent bundles of @xmath12 .",
    "the tangent and cotangent bundles are not the only vector bundles that can be defined over @xmath12 . given a vector bundle @xmath23 over the space - time manifold",
    ", we define the vector bundle @xmath24 whose sections a smooth functionals of fields with values in @xmath25 . in other words ,",

    "here we do not require the section @xmath28 $ ] to be smooth ; discontinuous or even distributional sections are also allowed .",
    "we will refer to @xmath29 as the vector bundle associated with @xmath30 .",
    "the dual vector bundle @xmath31 is defined to be the vector bundle associated with @xmath32 .    in order to justify our subsequent constructions some restrictions are to be imposed on the structure of the underlying space - time manifold .",
    "our basic assumption will be that @xmath1 is a globally hyperbolic manifold endowed with a volume form . in the most of field - theoretical models both the structures come from a lorentzian metric on @xmath1 .",
    "the globally hyperbolic manifolds is a natural arena for the theory of hyperbolic differential equations with well - posed cauchy problem . by definition ,",
    "each globally hyperbolic manifold @xmath1 admits a global time function whose level surfaces provide a foliation of @xmath1 into space - like cauchy surfaces @xmath33 , so that @xmath34 . using the direct product structure",
    ", one can cut @xmath1 into the `` past '' and the `` future '' with respect to a given instant of time @xmath35 : @xmath36\\times n\\,,\\qquad m^+_t=[t,\\infty ) \\times n\\,,\\qquad m = m_t^-\\cup m_t^+\\,.\\ ] ]    given a vector bundle @xmath23 , we define the following subspaces in the space of sections @xmath25 :    * @xmath37 ; * @xmath38 ; * @xmath39 ; * @xmath40 .    here",
    "the spatially compact means that the intersection @xmath41 is compact for any @xmath42 .",
    "we will refer to the elements of @xmath43 and @xmath44 as the sections with retarded and advanced support , respectively .",
    "a differentiable functional @xmath45 is said to be compactly supported if @xmath46 . for example , a local functional , like the action functional , is compactly supported if it is given by an integral over a compact domain .",
    "the formally smooth and compactly supported functionals form a subalgebra @xmath47 .",
    "let now @xmath29 be a vector bundle associated with @xmath30 .",
    "we say that a section @xmath48 has retarded , advanced or compact support if @xmath28\\in \\gamma(e)$ ] does so for any field configuration @xmath49 .",
    "the sections with the mentioned support properties form subspaces in @xmath50 , which will be denoted by @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "when dealing with local field theories it is also useful to introduce the subspace of local sections @xmath54 .",
    "this consists of those sections of @xmath30 whose components are given , in each coordinate chart , by smooth functions of the field @xmath10 and its partial derivatives up to some finite order .",
    "for instance , the components of the euler - lagrange equations @xmath55 constitute a section of @xmath56 .",
    "the dynamics of fields are specified by a set of differential equations @xmath57=0\\,.\\ ] ] here @xmath58 is to be understood as including a space - time point . according to our definitions , the left hand sides of the equations can be viewed as components of a local section of some vector bundle @xmath29 over @xmath12 .",
    "we call @xmath29 the _ dynamics bundle_. since we do not assume the field equations ( [ t ] ) to come from the least action principle , the discrete part of the condensed index @xmath58 may have nothing to do with that of @xmath14 labeling the field components . in the special case of lagrangian systems ,",
    "the dynamics bundle coincides with the cotangent bundle @xmath59 and the field equations are determined by the exact 1-form ( [ ds ] ) , with @xmath60 being the action functional .",
    "let @xmath61 denote the space of all solutions to the field equations ( [ t ] ) .",
    "geometrically , we can think of @xmath61 as a smooth submanifold of @xmath12 and refer to @xmath61 as the _ dynamical shell _ or just the _ shell_. for the lagrangian systems the shell is just the set of all stationary points of the action @xmath60 . by referring to @xmath61 as a smooth submanifold we mean that the standard regularity conditions hold for the field equations @xcite .",
    "given the shell , a functional @xmath62 is said to be trivial iff @xmath63 .",
    "clearly , the trivial functionals form an ideal of the algebra @xmath64 . denoting this ideal by @xmath65 ,",
    "we define the quotient - algebra @xmath66 .",
    "the regularity of the field equations imply that for each trivial functional @xmath67 there exists a ( distributional ) section @xmath68 such that @xmath69 . in other words ,",
    "the trivial functionals are precisely those that are proportional to the equations of motion and their differential consequences . by definition ,",
    "the elements of the algebra @xmath70 are given by the equivalence classes of functionals from @xmath64 , where two functionals @xmath45 and @xmath3 are considered to be equivalent if @xmath71 .",
    "in that case we will write @xmath72 .",
    "formally , one can think of @xmath70 as the space of smooth , compactly supported functionals on @xmath61 .",
    "the first functional derivatives of the field equations ( [ t ] ) constitute the jacobi operator @xmath73 , @xmath74 geometrically , @xmath73 defines a homomorphism from the tangent to the dynamics bundle .",
    "the field equations ( [ t ] ) are said to be _ gauge invariant _ if there exist a vector bundle @xmath75 together with a section @xmath76 of @xmath77 such that @xmath78 in local field theory it is also assumed that @xmath79 $ ] is the integral kernel of a differential operator @xmath80 : \\gamma({\\mathcal{f}})\\rightarrow \\gamma(t{m})$ ] for each @xmath27 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we assume the bundle @xmath81 to be trivial and consider @xmath82 as a collection of vector fields on @xmath12 .",
    "this vector fields are called the gauge symmetry generators .",
    "the terminology is justified by the fact that for any infinitesimal section @xmath83 the infinitesimal change of field @xmath84 , where @xmath85 maps solutions of ( [ t ] ) to solutions . in other words , the vector fields @xmath86 are tangent to the dynamical shell @xmath61 .",
    "the gauge symmetry transformations are said to be trivial if @xmath87 .",
    "if the vector bundle @xmath81 is big enough to accommodate all nontrivial gauge symmetries , then we call @xmath81 the _ gauge algebra bundle _ and refer to @xmath86 as a complete set of gauge symmetry generators .",
    "it follows from the definition ( [ jr ] ) that the vector fields @xmath86 define an on - shell involutive vector distribution on @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath88\\approx c_{\\alpha\\beta}^\\gamma r_\\gamma\\,,\\ ] ] for some @xmath89 s .",
    "this distribution will be denoted by @xmath90 and called _",

    "_ physical observable_. the gauge invariant functionals form a subalgebra @xmath92 .",
    "two gauge invariant functionals @xmath45 and @xmath93 are considered as equivalent or represent the same physical observable if @xmath94 .",
    "so , we identify the physical observables with the equivalence classes of gauge invariant functionals from @xmath64 .",
    "this definition is consistent as the trivial functionals are automatically gauge invariant and the property of being gauge invariant passes through the quotient @xmath95 . in what follows",
    "we will identify physical observables with their particular representatives in @xmath96 .",
    "according to our definitions each classical field theory is completely specified by a pair @xmath97 , where @xmath24 is a vector bundle over the configuration space of fields and @xmath98 is a particular section of @xmath99 .",
    "the solution space @xmath61 is then identified with the zero locus of the section @xmath98 . whereas the classical equations of motion @xmath100=0 $ ] are enough to formulate the classical dynamics they are certainly insufficient for constructing a quantum - mechanical description of fields .",
    "any quantization procedure has to involve one or another additional structure . within the path - integral quantization , for instance , it is the action functional that plays the role of such an extra structure .",
    "the procedure of canonical quantization relies on the hamiltonian form of dynamics , involving a non - degenerate poisson bracket and a hamiltonian .",
    "either approach assumes the existence of a variational formulation for the classical equations of motion ( the least action principle ) and becomes inapplicable beyond the scope of variational dynamics .",
    "the extension of these quantization methods to non - variational dynamics was proposed in @xcite , @xcite . in particular , the least action principle of the lagrangian formalism",
    "was shown to admit a far - reaching generalization based on the concept of a _",
    "lagrange anchor_.    like many fundamental concepts , the notion of a lagrange anchor can be introduced and motivated from various perspectives . some of these motivations and interpretations can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite . for our present purposes",
    "it is convenient to define the lagrange anchor @xmath101 as a linear operator making the on - shell commutative diagram @xmath102^{j } & & \\gamma(\\mathcal{e } ) \\\\",

    "the on - shell commutativity of the diagram means that @xmath105 due to the regularity condition , the off - shell form of the last equality reads @xmath106 for some @xmath89 s .    in the case of lagranian theories @xmath107 and we can take @xmath108",
    ". then ( [ lad1 ] ) reduces to the commutativity of the second functional derivatives , @xmath109 . the operator @xmath108 is referred to as the _ canonical lagrange anchor _ for lagrangian equations of motion .",
    "it should be noted that even for lagrangian equations @xmath55 there may exist non - canonical lagrange anchors .    as with the generators of gauge symmetries",
    ", we can think of the lagrange anchor as a collection of vector fields @xmath110 on @xmath12 .",

    "only a part of physical degrees of freedom may fluctuate and/or the intensity of fluctuations around a particular field configuration @xmath49 may vary with @xmath10 .    unlike the gauge distribution @xmath90 ,",

    "on the other hand , in the absence of resonance @xmath162 , one can always choose the non - canonical lagrange anchor ( [ vpu ] ) to meet inequalities ( [ ineq ] ) .",
    "upon quantization the positive - definite hamiltonian will have a positive energy spectrum and a well - defined ground state .",
    "the last property is crucial for the quantum stability of the system @xcite .",
