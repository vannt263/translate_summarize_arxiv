    "cosmic gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the most luminous events ever known in the universe after the big bang",
    ". the luminosity , duration and bulk lorentz factor are crucial parameters of grbs @xcite . based on the duration grbs",
    "can be divided into two main groups , short and long bursts .",
    "once the redshift of a burst is measured , with a given cosmology model the luminosity distance is known , so are its luminosity and isotropic - equivalent @xmath0ray energy . though the physical processes producing prompt emission and afterglow of grbs are still unclear , it is widely accepted that the outflows move ultra - relativistically ( i.e. , its velocity is very close to the speed of light ) .",
    "the most reliable evidence is the measurement of superluminal movement of the radio afterglow image of grb 030329 @xcite . in the literature",
    ", several methods have been developed to constrain the initial bulk lorentz factors of grb outflows .",
    "( 1 ) the detection of the high energy photons imply the emitting region is optical thin for pair annihilation .",
    "this argument leads to a lower limit on lorentz factor @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) in some cases the peak in the early grb afterglow lightcurves marks the deceleration of the external forward shock , at which the lorentz factor is about half of the initial value . in such cases",
    "the initial lorentz factor , weakly depending on the isotropic - equivalent kinetic energy and the density of the medium , can be tightly constrained @xcite .",
    "( 3 ) detection of a thermal emission component in the grb afterglow spectrum provides a relatively direct way to estimate the lorentz factor . assuming a thermal radiation efficiency , with the measured temperature and flux of the thermal component",
    ", one can calculate the bulk lorentz factor @xcite .",
    "( 4 ) the non - detection of a hard x - ray to soft gamma - ray background emission in grb prompt stage gives an upper limit on the initial lorentz factor of grb outflows @xcite .",
    "many _ swift _ grbs were followed by energetic x - ray flares .",
    "usually their fluences are only about @xmath1 of that of prompt emission .",
    "however in quite a few events , the energy of x - ray flare is comparable to that of prompt emission . the temporal behavior and the hardness ratio evolution of x - ray flares are similar to those of prompt emission pulses @xcite , supporting the idea that they have the same physical origin of the prompt emission , i.e. , they are also due to the activity of central engine ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "in such a kind of model , the central engine launches new outflow at late times . as in the prompt emission phase ,",
    "the bulk lorentz factor of the flare outflow is a crucial parameter .",
    "unfortunately , most models constraining the bulk lorentz factor of the grb outflow are invalid for the x - ray flares . for example , the methods developed in @xcite and @xcite are irrelevant since there is a preceding and more energetic grb outflow expanding into the medium .",
    "so far there are three kinds of speculations on the bulk lorentz factor of the flare outflows : ( a ) the typical bulk lorentz factor of flares is just tens and is considerably smaller than that of the outflow powering prompt emission @xcite ; ( b ) the typical bulk lorentz factor of flares is higher but not much higher than that of the outflow giving rise to prompt emission @xcite .",
    "please note that in both case ( a ) and case ( b ) , the flare photons are powered by the energy dissipation within the newly launched outflow .",
    "( c ) in the x - ray flare model of up - scattered forward shock emission , late outflow with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath2 is required @xcite .",
    "the divergency between these arguments are very large . in this work ,",
    "we develop two different methods , as described in section [ sec : model ] , to estimate the bulk lorentz factor of the outflows .",
    "the case studies are presented in section [ sec : case ] .",
    "we summarize our result with some discussion in section [ sec : ds ] .",
    "* method i * : the physical composition of x - ray flare outflows is not well constrained yet .",
    "@xcite suggested that in the neutron star@xmath3neutron star ( or black hole ) merger model the outflow powering x - ray flares following short grbs might be poynting - flux dominated since the fallback accretion onto the newly formed black hole is too low to launch an energetic ejecta via neutrino annihilation .",
    "but for long grbs the argument is weak .",
    "recently ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and the references therein ) argued that the x - ray flare outflow was likely poynting - flux dominated if the prompt emission was powered by the magnetic energy dissipation .",
    "however the physical origin of the prompt emission is still in debate .",
    "therefore here we assume that the flare outflow is baryonic .",
    "the central engine releases a large amount of energy into a compact region .",
    "therefore the outflow is very hot with a temperature @xmath4 , depending on the total luminosity of the flare outflow ( @xmath5 ) as well as the initial radius of the outflow getting launched ( @xmath6 ) . as in the case of fireball powering prompt emission , the flare outflow will be accelerated by the thermal pressure until it becomes optically thin ( i.e. , the optical depth @xmath7 ) or saturates at a radius @xmath8 , depending on the outflow is baryon - rich or not . in the baryon - poor case",
    "the outflow becomes transparent at @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the dimensionless entropy of the initial ejecta .",
    "the thermal energy has not been effectively converted into the kinetic energy of the outflow and will give rise to a quasi - thermal radiation component .",
    "the absence of such a soft component in the data may suggest that the flare outflow is baryon - rich , for which the final bulk lorentz factor can be estimated as @xmath11 @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the optical depth of the photon at the radius @xmath8 can be estimated as @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the number density of electrons coupled with protons in the observer s frame , @xmath14 is the thompson cross section , and @xmath15 is the rest mass of protons . combing with the relations @xmath16 and @xmath17 , eq.([eq : m1 ] ) gives @xmath18 therefore the bulk lorentz factor of x - ray flares is related to @xmath5 and @xmath19 as ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) @xmath20 throughout this work , the convention @xmath21 has been taken into account except for some special notations . for @xmath22 , the photospheric radius of the flare outflow",

    "is taken to be comparable to that of grbs , i.e. , @xmath28 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ) , we are then able to give an upper limit on @xmath29 .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it may apply to a good fraction of x - ray flares .",
    "the limit of this approach is that it is only valid for the baryonic outflows .",
    "* method ii * : the quick decline of the x - ray flares @xcite may have imposed a tight constraint on the emission radius @xmath30 @xcite , provided that the quickly decaying x - ray emission is the high latitude component of the flare pulses .",
    "this interpretation , if correct , requires a very large variability timescale @xmath31 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also below ) .",
    "the corresponding bulk lorentz factor thus can be estimated by @xmath32^{1/2}$ ] , please note that the timescales involved here and below are all in the rest frame of the grb source .",
    "if @xmath30 as well as @xmath31 can be reliably estimated , @xmath33 can be reasonably constrained .    for simplicity",
    ", we take the leading late internal shock model for illustration . assuming that there are two shells , the slow one is ejected at @xmath34 and moves with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath35 ,",
    "the faster one is with @xmath36 , and their ejection interval is @xmath37 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the widths of both shells are @xmath38 ( in the observer s frame )",
    ". the faster one would catch up with the slower at a radius @xmath39 after the merger , the newly formed shell has a bulk lorentz factor @xmath40 , if the mass of these two shells are comparable @xcite .",
    "the timescale of that merger is determined by the reverse shock crossing the fast shell and is @xmath41 .",
    "the corresponding radius is @xmath42 at which the emission peaks . in the internal shock phase ,",
    "usually the electrons cool rapidly @xcite . after the ceasing of the internal shock ,",
    "the emission is from the high latitude @xmath43 and takes a form @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and the standard convention of the flux as a function of both time and frequency @xmath48 is adopted . in this work , we assume that the ejecta is uniform .    in reality",
    ", the flare consists of many ( for example @xmath49 ) pulses .",
    "after the ceasing of internal shocks at @xmath50 , what we observe is the high latitude emission of the early pulses .",

    "_ this can be understood as follows_. in the popular internal shock scenario , each prompt pulse is independent and is emitted at a radius @xmath58 . at late times ,",
    "the emission contributed by early shells is from a very large angle , and is very weak due to the relativistic beam effect . _",
    "the observed flux is thus dominated by the curvature emission component of the last pulse ( if all @xmath59 are comparable ) or one early pulse having a very large duration @xmath60 .",

    "are well fitted by @xmath63 , which is consistent with the curvature effect @xcite interpretation of that phenomenon .",
    "the inferred @xmath64 is a good approximation of the ejection time of the last dominant pulse ( rather than the re - activity time of the central engine unless there is just a pulse ) .    as shown in eq.([eq : fp2 ] ) , for the last dominant pulse , @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the peak time of the last dominated pulse . on the other hand , the curvature emission component ( i.e. , the tail emission ) lasts @xmath67 until the edge of the ejecta is visible ( see fig.[fig : tail ] ) . for an ejecta",
    "having a half - opening angle @xmath68 ( which can be estimated from the achromatic breaks of the late afterglow lightcurves @xcite ) , the prompt emission radius can be estimated as @xmath69 so we have @xmath70^{1/2}\\approx [ { t_{\\rm tail } \\over    2(1-\\cos \\theta_{\\rm j})(t_{\\rm p}-t_0)}]^{1/2}. \\label{eq : fp3}\\ ] ] in many cases , it is inconvenient to get @xmath66 and @xmath64 , respectively . fortunately , a simpler way to estimate @xmath71 is available .",
    "we introduce the factor @xmath72 to denote the ratio between the peak flux of the x - ray flare ( @xmath73 ) and the flux when a cutoff emerges ( @xmath74 ) , i.e. , @xmath75 ( see fig.[fig : tail ] ) . with eq.([eq : fp2 ] ) , we have @xmath76 combing eq.([eq : fp3 ] ) with eq.([eq : fp4 ] ) , we have @xmath77 } / \\theta_{\\rm j}. \\label{eq : fpb}\\ ] ] with a typical @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "so our estimate of @xmath33 can not be modified significantly by the uncertainty of @xmath72 .",
    "the choice of @xmath68 , instead , is crucial for our purpose . for the x - ray flare outflow",
    ", there is no simple / reliable method to estimate its half - opening angle @xmath80 .",
    "however , it is reasonable to argue that @xmath80 can not be much smaller than @xmath81 .",
    "this is because x - ray flare(s ) have been observed in about @xmath82 _ swift _ grbs , so statistically speaking , @xmath83 ( x. y. dai 2006 , private communication ) , where @xmath84 is the half - opening angle of the grb ejecta that can be inferred from the late afterglow break .",
    "such a small correction can just increase our estimate of @xmath33 ( see eq.([eq : fpb ] ) for details ) by a factor of 1.4 and thus does not change our basic conclusion . as a consequence , in the case studies ( see below ) , we simply take @xmath85 . the error of the resulting @xmath33 can be estimated straightforwardly and can be approximated by @xmath86 , where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the errors of @xmath72 and @xmath68 , respectively . for @xmath78 and @xmath89",
    ", we have @xmath90 . for a conservative estimate @xmath91 , we have @xmath92 .    different from method i",
    ", the current method can give a somewhat reliable estimate of @xmath33 rather than an upper limit .",
    "however , a cutoff at the end of the quick decline is needed to achieve that goal .",
    "unfortunately an unambiguous cutoff in the quick decline phase has just been identified in a few giant flares , limiting the application of method ii .",
    "we d like to point out that method ii is also valid to estimate the bulk lorentz factor of the late outflow of grbs if the quick decline phase of prompt emission is also attributed to the so - called curvature effect .",
    "for method i , we take a sample consisting of 36 x - ray flares detected in 14 grbs with measured redshift , as reported in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the average bolometric luminosity , i.e. , the bolometric energy divided by the duration , is derived for both the power - law and the band function fits to the flares @xcite . as already mentioned , the total luminosity of the flare is taken to be 10 times than that of the x - ray emission .",
    "@xmath19 is taken as @xmath93 cm , which is comparable to the radius of a neutron star or the last stable circle orbit for a rapidly rotating black hole ( in the thermal radiation modeling of some grbs , @xmath6 is estimated to be @xmath94 cm or even larger ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "so our estimate is likely conservative ) .",
    "the results are presented in fig.[fig : gamma_t ] and fig.[fig : distribution ] .",
    "the resulting upper limits on @xmath33 are between tens to hundreds , which are generally smaller than the initial bulk lorentz factor of grb outflows @xmath95 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for the baryonic outflow , we have @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the mass loading rate of the outflow . the inferred @xmath98 following the flares in grb 050502b and grb",
    "050724 suggests that the flare outflows are still relativistic , strengthening the connection between the x - ray flares and the prompt soft @xmath0ray emission .",
    "since the typical total luminosity of the flare outflows is about two or more orders of magnitude lower than that of the grb outflows , the mass loading rate of the flare outflow is expected to be lower than that of the grb outflow otherwise relativistic ejecta can not be launched .",
    "this is reasonable since the pole region of a dying massive star ( or the remnant of the merger of two compact objects ) is expected to be more and more clean as the time goes on .",
    "below we focus on method ii .",
    "the sharp decline has been well detected in a good fraction of x - ray flares . for our purpose , a cutoff , emerging when the emission at the edge of the ejecta is within the line of sight , of the tail emission is needed to constrain @xmath99 reliably .",
    "such a cutoff has just been possibly identified in a few cases , for example , the giant flare in grb 050502b @xcite , and the giant flare in grb 050724 @xcite .",
    "the reason for such a rare detection is the following .",
    "in reality , the x - ray emission is not only contributed by the high latitude emission but also contributed by the forward shock emission .",
    "the latter would dominate over the former when the high latitude emission component has dropped by 2 or more orders ( correspondingly , @xmath100 for @xmath101 ) unless the x - ray flare is strong enough , or the forward shock emission is very dim . on the other hand , when the flux has dropped to a level of @xmath102 , the signal / noise ratio is not high enough to get a good quality detection and thus renders the identification of the cutoff difficultly .",
    "the data ( together with corresponding reference ) are presented in the table.[tab : tab1 ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : tab1 ]",
    "_ note _ that there is a possible independent argument favoring a @xmath103 tens for giant flares following grb 050502b and grb 050724 .",
    "as suggested in @xcite , in the leading late internal shock model , the x - ray flare outflow with a @xmath104 tens will catch up with the initial grb outflow when the latter has swept a large amount of material and then got decelerated .",
    "such an energy injection process would give rise to a flattening ( if there is also a wide range of the bulk lorentz factors of the x - ray flare outflow ) or re - brightening signature ( if the range of the bulk lorentz factors of the flare outflow is narrow ) .",
    "the re - brightening has been well detected in the late x - ray afterglow of grb 050502b and grb 050724 . to attribute the very late x - ray flare in grb 050502b to an energy injection caused by the giant x - ray flare outflow",
    ", a @xmath105 is needed @xcite , matching our result perfectly . as for grb 050724",
    ", @xcite showed that the late multi - wavelength re - brightening could be well reproduced by an energy injection . before the energy injection ,",
    "the kinetic energy of the grb ejecta @xmath106 erg and the number density of the medium is @xmath107 .",
    "the decelerating grb ejecta has a bulk lorentz factor @xmath108 .",
    "if this energy injection is also caused by the flare outflow catching up with the grb ejecta , a @xmath109 is needed , which is consistent with our result .        finally , we would like to point out that only the x - ray flares brighter than the forward shock x - ray emission can be identified .",
    "there could be some faint x - ray flares which have even lower bulk lorentz factor .",
    "bright x - ray flares have been well detected in the afterglow of a considerable fraction of grbs .",
    "the radiation mechanism powering these events is still unclear .",
    "a widely accepted hypothesis is that new outflow should be launched by the central engine and the flares should be powered by the energy dissipation within the new outflow .",
    "the lack of an optical flare associated with the x - ray flare is in general consistent with such a scenario @xcite .",
    "the bulk lorentz factor of the newly launched outflow is a crucial parameter for us to understand x - ray flares .",
    "for example , with the inferred bulk lorentz factor we can see whether the outflow is relativistic or not .",
    "then we can estimate the corresponding mass loading rate in the pole region of the central engine .",
    "if the inferred bulk lorentz factor is so high that surpasses the upper limit given in eq.([eq : gamma_x ] ) , the baryonic outflow model will be ruled out .    in this work",
    "we have developed two methods to estimate the bulk lorentz factor of x - ray flare outflow ( see section 2 ) . in the first method",
    "the outflow is assumed to be baryonic and is accelerated by the thermal pressure , for which the final bulk lorentz factor is limited by the outflow luminosity as well as the initial radius of the outflow getting accelerated .",
    "such a method may be applied to a considerable fraction of flares .",
    "however it can only give an upper limit and is invalid if the flare outflow is poynting - flux dominated .",
    "the second method , based on the curvature effect interpretation of the quick decline of flare , is independent of the physical composition of the outflow and can give a better constrained estimate of the bulk lorentz factor of the flare outflow but can only be applied to a few events .",
    "the obtained bulk lorentz factors ( or just upper limit ) of the x - ray flare outflows in these two different ways are consistent with each other and are generally smaller than that of the grb outflows ( see section 3 ) .",
    "however , the flare outflows are still relativistic and the corresponding baryon loading rate is expected to be very low ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "this finding , together with other results from the analysis of the x - ray flare data such as the temporal behavior and the hardness ratio evolution , strongly favors the hypothesis that x - ray flares are the low energy analogy of the prompt soft @xmath0ray emission @xcite . with method",
    "ii , the lorentz factors of the two giant flares are found to be @xmath111 , well below the upper limits given by method i ( see also tab.1 ) .",
    "hence the baryonic outflow model is not challenged . for the magnetic outflow with reasonable baryon loading ,",
    "a moderate lorentz factor is also possible .",
    "further data like the high linear - polarization of the x - ray photons is needed to claim the magnetic nature of the flare outflow .",
    "if the x - ray flare outflows do have a bulk lorentz factor @xmath112 , as suggested in the flare model of up - scattered forward shock emission @xcite , the acceleration can not be due to the thermal pressure .",
    "the only known such a kind of extreme astrophysical object is the pulsar wind , which may move with a lorentz factor as high as @xmath113 and its acceleration is likely a result of the significant magnetic energy reconnection @xcite .",
    "it s less likely to be the case for the x - ray flares since the central engine of grbs is not in a cavity as clean as that of a pulsar at an age of @xmath114 years .",
    "as for the flare model of up - scattered forward shock emission , one more challenge is that the similarities between the grb prompt emission and the x - ray flare emission strongly suggest a similar physical origin of these two kinds of phenomena .",
