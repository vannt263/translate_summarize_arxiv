    "galaxy bias is one of the key ingredients for describing our observable universe . in a concordance @xmath14cdm model ,",
    "galaxies form at overdensities of the dark matter distribution , suggesting the possibility of simple relations between the distribution of galaxies and dark matter .",
    "this particular relation is described by a galaxy bias model @xcite .",
    "galaxy bias bridges the observable universe of galaxies with the underlying dark matter . for a full review of literature on galaxy bias , we refer the readers to @xcite and references therein .",
    "observationally , several measurement techniques exist for constraining galaxy bias .",
    "the most common approach is to measure galaxy bias through the 2-point correlation function ( 2pcf ) of galaxies @xcite .",
    "counts - in - cells ( cic ) is another method where the higher moments of the galaxy probability density function ( pdf ) are used to constrain galaxy bias @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can combine galaxy clustering with measurements from gravitational lensing , which probes the total ( baryonic and dark ) matter distribution .",
    "such measurements include combining galaxy clustering with galaxy - galaxy lensing @xcite and lensing of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite .",
    "the method we present in this work also belongs to this class .    with ongoing and upcoming large galaxy surveys ( the hyper suprimecam , the dark energy survey , the kilo degree survey , the large synoptic survey telescope , the euclid mission , the wide - field infrared survey telescope ) , statistical uncertainties on the galaxy bias measurements will decrease significantly .",
    "it is thus interesting to explore alternative and independent options of measuring galaxy bias .",
    "such measurements would be powerful tests for systematic uncertainties and break possible degeneracies .    in this paper , we present a new measurement of the redshift - dependent galaxy bias from the dark energy survey ( des ) science verification ( sv ) data using a novel method .",
    "our method relies on the cross - correlation between weak lensing shear and galaxy density maps to constrain galaxy bias .",
    "the method naturally combines the power of galaxy surveys and weak lensing measurements in a way that only weakly depends on assumptions of the cosmological parameters .",
    "in addition , the method involves building up a high - resolution 3d mass map in the survey volume which is interesting for studies of the dark matter distribution at the map level .",
    "the relation between the galaxy sample and the mass map also provides information for studies of galaxy evolution .",
    "the analysis in this paper closely follows ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter a12 ) and ( * ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) .",
    "a12 applied this method to cosmos and zcosmos data and discussed different approaches for constructing the galaxy density map and galaxy bias .",
    "paper i carried out a series of simulation tests to explore the regime of the measurement parameters where the method is consistent with 2pcf measurements , while introducing alternative approaches to the methodology .",
    "building on these two papers , this work applies the method to the des sv data , demonstrating the first constraints with this method using photometric data .",
    "simulations are used side - by - side with data to ensure that each step in the data analysis is robust . in particular , we start with the same set of `` ideal '' simulations used in paper i and gradually degrade until they match the data by including noise , photometric redshift errors , and masking effects .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in",
    "we overview the basic principles of our measurement method . in",
    "we introduce the data and simulations used in this work .",
    "the analysis and results are presented in , first with a series of simulation tests and then with the des sv data .",
    "we also present a series of systematics tests here .",
    "in we compare our measurements with bias measurements on the same data set using different approaches .",
    "we conclude in .",
    "in this work we follow paper i , where the overdensities of galaxies @xmath15 is linearly related to the overdensities of dark matter @xmath16 at some given smoothing scale @xmath17 , or @xmath18 we define @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the dark matter density and @xmath21 is the mean dark matter density at a given redshift . @xmath15 is defined similarly , with @xmath20 replaced by @xmath22 , the number density of galaxies .",
    "@xmath23 can depend on galaxy properties such as luminosity , color and type @xcite .",
    "this definition is often referred to as the `` local bias '' model . according to @xcite , at sufficiently large scales ( @xmath24 mpc / h comoving distance ) ,",

    ". the angle bracket @xmath32 averages over all pairs of positions on the sky separated by distance @xmath33 .",
    "our work will be based on scales in this regime .",
    "weak lensing refers to the coherent distortion , or `` shear '' of galaxy images caused by large - scale cosmic structures between these galaxies and the observer .",
    "weak lensing probes directly the total mass instead of a proxy of the total mass ( e.g. stellar mass , gas mass ) . for a detailed review of the theoretical background of weak lensing , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the main weak lensing observable is the complex shear @xmath34 , which is estimated by the measured shape of galaxies .",
    "the cosmological shear signal is much weaker than the intrinsic galaxy shapes . the uncertainty in the shear estimate due to this intrinsic galaxy shape is referred to as `` shape noise '' , and is often the largest source of uncertainty in lensing measurements .",
    "shear can be converted to convergence , @xmath35 , a scalar field that directly measures the projected mass .",
    "the convergence at a given position @xmath36 on the sky can be expressed as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the lensing weight @xmath39 here , @xmath40 is the comoving distance , @xmath41 is the total matter density of the universe today normalised by the critical density today , @xmath42 is the hubble constant today , and @xmath43 is the scale factor .",
    "@xmath44 is the normalized redshift distribution of the `` source '' galaxy sample where the lensing quantities ( @xmath45 or @xmath35 ) are measured . in the simple case of a single source redshift plane at @xmath46 ,",
    "@xmath47 is a delta function and the lensing weight becomes @xmath48    in the flat - sky approximation , conversion between @xmath45 and @xmath35 in fourier space follows ( * ? ? ? * ks conversion ) : @xmath49 where `` @xmath50 '' indicates the fourier transform of the field @xmath51 , @xmath52 is the spatial frequency , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are small constant offsets which can not be reconstructed and are often referred to as the `` mass - sheet degeneracy '' .",

    "the relation between @xmath35 , @xmath57 and @xmath23 in the case of redshift - dependent galaxy bias ( ) becomes more complicated .",
    "this requires the introduction of the `` partial '' @xmath57 , or @xmath61 below .",

    "summarizes the results .",
    "as discussed earlier , our method becomes much less constraining going to higher redshift , as the source galaxies become sparse .",
    "this is manifested in the increasingly large error bars going to high redshifts .",
    "here we only performed a simple linear fit to the data given the large uncertainties in our measurements . in the future",
    ", one could extend to explore more physically motivated galaxy bias models @xcite .",
    "compared with a12 , our data set is approximately @xmath0105 times larger , but with a ( source ) galaxy number density @xmath011.6 times lower .",
    "this yields roughly @xmath108 times lower statistical uncertainty in our measurement .",
    "our sample occupies a volume slightly larger than the @xmath109 sample in a12 .",
    "note , however , that due to photo-@xmath13 uncertainties and the high shape noise per unit area , we expect a slightly higher level of systematic uncertainty in our measurement .",
    "since in a12 , the emphasis was not on measuring linear bias , one should take caution in comparing directly our measurement with a12 .",
    "but we note that the large uncertainties at @xmath110 and the weak constraints on the redshift evolution in the galaxy bias is also seen in a12 . to give competitive constraints on the redshift evolution , higher redshift source planes would be needed .      in",
    ", we have checked for various forms of systematic effects coming from the ks conversion , finite area , complicated mask geometry , and photo-@xmath13 errors .",
    "here we perform three additional tests .",
    "first , we check that the cross - correlation between the b - mode shear @xmath111 and @xmath112 is small .",
    "next , we check that using the second des shear pipeline , im3shape gives consistent answers with that from ngmix .",
    "finally , we check that using two other photo-@xmath13 codes also give consistent results .",
    "these three tests show that there are no significant systematic errors in our measurements .",
    "lensing b - mode refers to the divergent - free piece of the lensing field , which is zero in an ideal , noiseless scenario . as a result ,",
    "b - mode is one of the measures for systematic effects in the data . in @xcite , a large suite of tests",
    "have been carried out to ensure that the shear measurements have lower level of systematic uncertainties compared to the statistical uncertainties .",
    "nevertheless , here we test in specific the b - mode statistics relevant to our measurements .",
    "we construct a @xmath111 field by rotating the shear measurements in our data by 45 degrees , giving : @xmath113 substituting @xmath111 into @xmath45 in our galaxy bias calculation ( ) gives an analogous measurement to @xmath23 , which we will refer to as @xmath114 .",
    "since we expect @xmath111 not to correlate well with @xmath112 , @xmath115 would ideally go to zero . in ,",
    "we show all the @xmath114 measurements using both shear component and all lens - source combinations .",
    "we see that all the data points are consistent with zero at the 12 @xmath3 level , assuring that the b - modes in the shear measurements are mostly consistent with noise .",
    "we also show the weighted mean of all the data points and the corresponding b - mode measurements from one of the simulation used in ( iv ) .",
    "we see that the level and scatter in the data is compatible with that in the simulations .      as described in , two independent shear catalogs from des sv",
    "were constructed . here , we perform the same measurement in our main analysis using the im3shape catalog .",
    "the im3shape catalog contains less galaxies , thus the measurements are slightly noisier .",
    "the resulting redshift - dependent galaxy measurements are shown in and are overall slightly higher than the ngmix measurements , and there is almost no constraining power on the evolution .",
    "the best - fit linear bias model is : @xmath116 , which is consistent with the ngmix measurements at the 1@xmath3 level .",
    "the b - modes ( not shown here ) are similar to .",
    "as mentioned in , several photo-@xmath13 catalogs were generated for the des sv data set and shown in @xcite to meet the required precision and accuracy for the sv data .",
    "all above analyzes were carried out with the skynet photo-@xmath13 catalog .",
    "here we perform the exact same analysis using the other two catalogs : bpz and tpz . in specific , to be consistent with the other des sv analyzes @xcite , we keep the tomographic bins unchanged ( binned by skynet mean redshift ) , but use the @xmath117 from the different photo-@xmath13 codes to calculate @xmath98 . the lensing or galaxy maps themselves remain unchanged",
    ".    lists the results from the different photo-@xmath13 catalogs . since skynet and tpz are both machine learning codes and respond to systematic effects in a similar fashion , while bpz is a template fitting code , we can thus view the difference between the results from bpz and the others as a rough measure of the potential systematic uncertainty in our photo-@xmath13 algorithm ( see also discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is shown here to be within the @xmath118 error bars .",
    "the redshift - dependent galaxy bias has been measured on the same data set using other approaches .",
    "here we compare our result with two other measurements  galaxy clustering ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter c16 ) and cross - correlation of galaxies and cmb lensing ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter g16).we note that both these analyzes assumed the most recent _ planck _ cosmological parameters @xcite , which is slightly different from our assumptions ( see ) .",
    "but since our measurement depends very weakly on the assumption of cosmological parameters ( as discussed in ) , the stronger cosmology dependencies come from the cosmological parameters assumed in c16 and g16 , which are known well within our measurement uncertainties .",
    "we also note that the results we quote in are based on the photo-@xmath13 code tpz , which means our redshift binning is not completely identical to theirs .",
    "measurements from the b - mode shear and the same @xmath112 in our main analysis .",
    "each small blue data point represents a measurement from a combination of lens redshift , source redshift , and shear component .",
    "note that the low redshift bins contain more data points , as there are more source galaxies that can be used for the measurement .",
    "the large blue points are the weighted mean of all measurements at the same redshift bin from the des sv data , while the red points are that from simulations that are well matched to data . ]      in c16 , galaxy bias was estimated through the ratio between the projected galaxy angular correlation function ( 2pcf ) in a given redshift bin and an analytical dark matter angular correlation function predicted at the same redshift .",
    "the latter includes both linear and nonlinear dark matter clustering derived from camb @xcite assuming a set of cosmological parameters . in c16 , a flat @xmath14cdm+@xmath119 cosmological model based on _ planck",
    "_ 2013 + _ wmap _ polarization + act / spt + bao was used .",
    "the results in c16 as listed in were shown to be consistent with the independent measurement from the cfhtls @xcite .",
    "compared to c16 , our work aims to measure directly the local galaxy bias ( ) instead of the galaxy bias defined through the 2pcf ( ) .",
    "although the two measurements agree in the linear regime where this work is based on , comparing the measurements on smaller scales will provide further insight to these galaxy bias models .",
    "our method is less sensitive to assumptions of cosmological parameters compared to the 2pcf method . in particular , it does not depend strongly on @xmath12 , which breaks the degeneracy between @xmath12 and the measured galaxy bias @xmath23 in other measurement methods .",
    "finally , since our measurement is a cross - correlation method ( compared to c16 , an auto - correlation method ) , it suffers less from systematic effects that only contaminate either the lens or the source sample . on the other hand , however , lensing measurements are intrinsically noisy and the conversion between shear and convergence is not well behaved in the presence of noise and complicated masking . in addition , we only considered a one - point estimate ( zero - lag correlation ) , which contains less information compared to the full 2pcf functions .",
    "all these effects result in much less constraining power in our measurements .",
    "as shown in and listed in , our measurements and c16 agree very well except for the redshift bin @xmath120 ( slightly more than 1@xmath3 discrepancy ) .",
    "we note , however , both c16 and our work may not have included the complete allocation of systematic errors ( especially those coming from the photo-@xmath13 uncertainties ) , which could introduce some of the discrepancies .      in g16",
    ", galaxy bias is estimated by the ratio between the galaxy - cmb convergence cross - correlation and an analytical prediction of the dark matter - cmb convergence cross - correlation , both calculated through the 2pcf ( and also in harmonic space through the power spectrum ) .",
    "since the lensing efficiency kernel of the cmb is very broad and the cmb lensing maps are typically noisy , this method has less constraining power than c16 .",
    "however , by using an independent external data , the cmb lensing maps from the south pole telescope and the _ planck _ satellite , this measurement serves as a good cross check for possible systematic effects in the des data .    in calculating the theoretical dark matter - cmb convergence cross - correlation",
    ", g16 also assumed a fixed cosmology and derived all predictions using camb .",
    "the @xmath12-@xmath23 degeneracy is thus also present in their analysis .",
    "we note , however , that one could apply our method to the cmb lensing data and avoid this dependency . in our framework",
    ", the cmb lensing plane will serve as an additional source plane at redshift @xmath01100 .",
    "we defer this option to future work .",
    "the results from g16 are shown in and listed in .",
    "these results come from the ratio between the measured and the predicted power spectrum , which suffers less from non - linear effects compared to the measurement in real space ( 2pcf ) .",
    "we find that g16 is systematically lower than our measurement at the 1 - 2@xmath3 level for all redshift bins .",
    "g16 also has more constraining power at high redshift compared to our results , as expected .",
    "possible reasons for the discrepancy at low redshift include systematic errors ( in e.g. the photo-@xmath13 estimation ) that are not included in either c16 , g16 or this work .",
    "in addition , the redshift bins are significantly covariant , making the overall discrepancy less significant .",
    "finally , the scales used in the three studies are slightly different .",
    "we refer the readers to g16 for more discussion of this discrepancy .",
    "in this paper , we present a measurement of redshift - dependent bias using a novel technique of cross - correlating the weak lensing shear maps and the galaxy density maps .",
    "the method serves as an alternative measurement to the more conventional techniques such as 2-point galaxy clustering , and is relatively insensitive to the assumed cosmological parameters .",
    "the method was first developed in @xcite and later tested more rigorously with simulations in a companion paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper i ) . here",
    "we extend the method and apply it on wide - field photometric galaxy survey data for the first time .",
    "we measure the galaxy bias for a magnitude - limited galaxy sample in the dark energy survey ( des ) science verification ( sv ) data .",
    "following from paper i , we carry out a series of simulation tests which incorporate step - by - step realistic effects in our data including shape noise , photo-@xmath13 errors and masking . in each step , we investigate the errors introduced in our estimation of galaxy bias .",
    "we find that shape noise and cosmic variance are the main sources of uncertainties , while the photo-@xmath13 affects the measurements in a predictable way if the characteristics of the photo-@xmath13 uncertainties are well understood .",
    "as the measurement itself is very noisy , simulation tests where we know the `` truth '' provide a good anchor for building the analysis pipeline .",
    "in our main analysis , we measure the galaxy bias with a @xmath121 magnitude - limited galaxy sample in 4 tomographic redshift bins to be @xmath4 ( @xmath122 ) , @xmath6 ( @xmath120 ) , @xmath8 ( @xmath123 ) , and @xmath10 ( @xmath124 ) .",

    ", our current data set may not be optimal .",
    "a more efficient configuration would be combining a wide , shallow data set with a narrow , deep field .",
    "we plan on exploring these possibilities in the future .",
    "the main uncertainty in this work comes from the combined effect of masking , shape noise and cosmic variance .",
    "however , as we demonstrated with simulations , moving to the larger sky coverage of the first and second year of des data would reduce this effect significantly .",
    "we have demonstrated the feasibility and validity of our method for measuring galaxy bias on a wide - field photometric data set .",
    "looking forward to the first and second year of des data ( @xmath02,000 square degrees and @xmath126 magnitude shallower ) , we expect to explore a variety of other topics using this method with the increased statistical power . for example",
    ", the same measurement could be carried out on different subsamples of lens galaxies ( in magnitude , color , galaxy type etc . ) and gain insight into the different clustering properties for different galaxy populations .",
    "also , one can extend the measurement into the non - linear regime and measure the scale - dependencies of the galaxy bias .",
    "finally , it would be interesting to compare the measurement from the 2pcf method and our method ( which is a measure of local bias ) on different scales to further understand the connections between the two galaxy bias models .",

    "the origin of the difference comes from the fact that when combining the multiple measurements in the same lens bin , we use the least - square formalism , which relies on the covariance matrix @xmath128 estimated through jk resampling .",
    "this covariance matrix can become ill - behaved depending on the estimator used . in our case , the denominator of @xmath23 ( the inverse of ) can become close to zero , which makes the inversion of the covariance matrix unstable .",
