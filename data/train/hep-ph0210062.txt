    "an f - ball , a kind of non - topological soliton , was introduced as a candidate for cdm @xcite .",
    "a similar object is also suggested to play an important role in baryogenesis @xcite .",
    "the simplest type of the f - ball is a bubble of false vacuum surrounded by a thin domain wall , on which many zero - mode fermions are attached .",
    "the surface tension of the wall is balanced with the fermi pressure due to the zero - mode fermions in the wall .",
    "the f - ball may be stabilized owing to this balance between the surface energy and the fermi energy .",
    "though the f - ball is stable against the variation of the radius in case it keeps a spherical shape , it may be unstable against deformation from sphere .",
    "macpherson and campbell pointed out in their pioneering work @xcite that such f - balls are unstable against deformation from the spherical shape , and that they should finally fragment into a number of tiny f - balls ( see fig.[frag.fig ] for illustration of a fragmenting f - ball ) .",
    ", height=188 ]    suppose there are a large number of such tiny f - balls in the present universe contributing sizably to cdm .",
    "the cosmic flux of these objects should be large , proportional to the inverse of the mass , and they should have been observed unless the scattering cross section with ordinary matter is very small . here , we are not interested in such a new kind of weakly interacting particles since we need too many new assumptions in introducing new tiny particles and have only indirect means to detect such particles @xcite .",
    "morris then introduced a new idea , an electrically charged f - ball which is considered to be stabilized due to the repulsive long - range coulomb force @xcite .",
    "since the charged f - balls can be large and heavy in this case , they can sizably contribute to cdm without contradicting the present observations of the cosmic flux .",
    "these f - balls with a large cross section of interaction with ordinary matter are interesting because of their future detectability .",
    "( we nevertheless note that the cross section per unit mass for the f - ball @xmath3 is not so large as the one which was recently proposed @xcite for the self - interacting dark matter .",
    "we do not go into details since the above issue is still controversial ( see the discussions in sec.[conclusion.sec ] ) . )    in the present paper , we first examine the instability of the neutral f - ball against the deformation from the spherical shape .",
    "it is known @xcite that the spherical shape is unstable against deformation due to the finite volume energy within the thin - wall approximation .",
    "we investigate the next - to - leading order approximation , the curvature effect of the wall , since it has a shape - dependent contribution to the total energy , and is important when the volume energy is very small .",
    "we find that the neutral f - ball is unstable even in the presence of the curvature effect .",
    "we next examine whether the f - ball is stable when it is electrically charged and unscreened . since the total energy of such an f - ball is higher than the sum of the energies of the fragmented f - balls , it fragments into smaller f - balls in finite time .",
    "its lifetime is , however , longer than the age of the universe if there is an energy barrier high enough between the state of an f - ball and that of fragmented f - balls .",
    "we see that the coulomb force does make the lifetime of the f - ball long enough .",
    "we thirdly examine whether the f - ball has a lifetime long enough to survive until present if it is screened due to the electrons or positrons in the thermal bath of the early universe .",
    "though the long ranged coulomb force becomes short ranged in the thermal bath , the lifetime of the f - ball is found long enough in the proper region of the parameters .",
    "we finally examine which kind of f - balls satisfy the conditions for a main component of cdm .",
    "we find that only the screened f - ball meets the conditions after taking into account the stability of the f - ball , observational constraints , and cosmological considerations .",
    "the above contents are organized as follows : we first consider electrically neutral f - balls and discuss their stability in sec.[neutral.sec ] .",
    "small f - balls which are electrically charged and not screened by electrons are considered in sec.[unscreened.sec ] .",
    "screened ones are considered in sec.[screened.sec ] ; this is the main theme in the present paper . in sec.[constraint.sec ] , we discuss certain constraints on the parameters obtained from various conditions .",
    "we have summaries and discussions in sec.[conclusion.sec ] .",
    "the detailed calculations are given in the appendices .",
    "we briefly introduce the electrically neutral f - ball proposed by macpherson and campbell @xcite to make clear the notations and technical terms .",
    "the lagrangian density is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are a scalar and a fermion field , respectively , and @xmath7 is a yukawa coupling constant . here",
    ", @xmath8 is an approximate double - well potential , . ]",
    "@xmath9 the first term has the @xmath0 symmetry under @xmath10 , and the second term violates the symmetry , though we assume it is much smaller than the first one ( see fig.[pot.fig ] ) .    .",
    "two almost degenerate vacua with the energy difference of @xmath11 exist : the true vacuum with @xmath12 and the false vacuum with @xmath13 .",
    "[ pot.fig],height=188 ]    thus , the lagrangian density has an approximate @xmath0 symmetry , which we call biased @xmath0 symmetry @xcite hereafter .",
    "after the phase transition breaks spontaneously the biased @xmath0 symmetry at @xmath14 , there arise two almost degenerate vacua with the energy density difference of @xmath11 .",
    "they are the true vacuum with @xmath12 and the false one with @xmath13 .",
    "then a domain wall is produced between two vacua , and the fermions are captured as zero - modes in the domain wall .",
    "can also exist in other cases , such as in the context of supersymmetry @xcite . ] though the effect of @xmath11 should be negligible soon after the phase transition , it gets more important as the universe expands .",
    "if the volume energy becomes larger than the surface energy during the expansion , the true vacuum is energetically favored and enlarges its volume . at the same time , the region of false vacuum gets diminished , and becomes a small confined region surrounded by the domain wall .",
    "such a region of false vacuum would continue to shrink due to the surface tension and the volume effect proportional to @xmath11 , and finally disappear if we neglect the fermi pressure caused by the zero - mode fermions trapped in the wall . in our case , however , the fermi pressure is not negligible and stops the shrinkage of the region , when it gets balanced with the surface tension .",
    "such a bubble of the false vacuum with zero - mode fermions trapped in the surrounding wall is called f - ball @xcite .",
    "we take the temperature for the f - ball production as @xmath15 .",
    "because @xmath16 is somewhat lower than @xmath17 , @xmath16 is assumed to be @xmath18 in the present paper .",
    "we consider a thin walled f - ball , the size of which is much larger than the thickness of the domain wall . for simplicity , we neglect the small energy difference @xmath11 and take the exact @xmath0 symmetry until sec.[constraint.sec ]",
    ". then the lagrangian density is @xmath19 the total energy of an f - ball is expressed as @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are a contribution from the domain wall and that from the zero - mode fermions , respectively . in the thin wall case , fermi gas in the wall",
    "distributes two dimensionally on the surface of the f - ball .",
    "vanishes `` surface of the f - ball '' . ]",
    "taking @xmath23-axis normal to the surface which is positive ( negative ) for the outside ( inside ) of the f - ball , we express the fermion number density as @xmath24 with @xmath25 the surface density of the fermion number , and the fermi energy , @xmath26 we obtain the surface energy , @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the radii of principal curvature of the f - ball surface ( see fig.[localcoordinate.fig ] and appendix [ dv.sec ] ) .    , the origin of which is on the surface of the f - ball .",
    "we take @xmath30 and @xmath1 along the lines of curvature on the surface , and @xmath23 normal to the surface . here , @xmath28 ( @xmath29 )",

    "thus , the energy of the f - ball is obtained by minimizing @xmath35 with @xmath36 the lagrange multiplier .",

    ", we obtain the uniform distribution of the fermions , @xmath37 with @xmath38 the area of the f - ball surface .",
    "we next minimize the energy with respect to @xmath5 . assuming that the variation of @xmath5 in the direction parallel to the f - ball surface is much smaller than that in the direction @xmath23",
    ", we get the euler - lagrange equation for @xmath5 , @xmath39 with the symbol dot in @xmath40 or @xmath41 standing for the derivative with respect to @xmath23 . here",
    ", @xmath5 fulfills the boundary condition , @xmath42 with @xmath43 the width of the wall .",
    "we take the leading contribution , @xmath44 , in the thin - wall expansion with @xmath45 .",
    "it satisfies @xmath46 with @xmath47 the solution for @xmath44 , @xmath48 with @xmath49 , minimizes the energy under the condition , eq.([neu_uniform_distr.eqn ] ) , to be @xmath50 with @xmath51 the surface tension in the wall .",
    "we finally minimize @xmath52 with respect to @xmath38 , and obtain @xmath53 with the area of the surface , @xmath54 .",
    "an f - ball can deform with this surface area being kept constant ( see fig.[frag.fig](a ) to fig.[frag.fig](c ) ) .",
    "moreover , it has the same energy even if it splits into some smaller f - balls ( see fig.[frag.fig](d ) ) since @xmath52 is proportional to the number of fermions .",
    "thus , we can not tell whether the f - ball is stable or not against deformation and fragmentation into pieces , within the thin - wall approximation which corresponds to the leading order in the thin - wall expansion .",
    "this is the same result as what macpherson and campbell derived in their paper @xcite .",
    "they concluded further that the neutral f - ball is unstable , taking into account the volume effect proportional to @xmath11 .",

    ", we take the curvature radius on the f - ball surface positive . in this case , the first term in eq.([neu_etot2.eqn ] ) is constant according to the gauss - bonnet theorem . in this case . ]",
    "thus , the shape - dependent sector in @xmath69 comes from the second term in eq.([neu_etot2.eqn ] ) . because it is semi - negative definite , and zero only for the spherical shape , the spherical f - ball is unstable against the perturbative deformation .",
    "we next consider the stability of the f - ball against fragmentation into smaller ones ( see fig.[frag.fig](d ) ) . in this case , the fragmentation does not change @xmath52 because it only depends on the fermion number . here , we compare the energy of the spherical f - ball with that of the fragmented spherical f - balls for simplicity .",
    "we see that the second term in eq.([neu_etot2.eqn ] ) vanishes .",
    "thus , only the first term in eq.([neu_etot2.eqn ] ) changes in the fragmentation . since it is proportional to the number of f - balls due to the gauss - bonnet theorem , its negative sign shows that the fragmentation is energetically promoted .",
    "therefore , we find that the f - ball is unstable against not only the deformation from the spherical shape but also the fragmentation into smaller ones .",
    "as pointed out by macpherson and campbell , the fragmentation will continue until the thin - wall expansion gets invalid .",
    "if the fragmented tiny f - balls sizably contribute to cdm , there should be a large number of them and a large cosmic flux of them as well .",
    "the present observations for the dark matter search tell that they can interact with ordinary matter only very weakly . such f - balls are not considered here since their detectability was discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "in the present section , we consider the electrically charged f - ball proposed by morris @xcite , in which the fermions trapped on the surface have electric charge .",
    "assigning the electric charge of @xmath78 to the fermion for simplicity , we consider an f - ball carrying the electric charge @xmath79 .",
    "the energy of the f - ball is expressed as @xmath80 with @xmath81 the coulomb potential energy .",
    "since the coulomb energy is proportional to the fermion number squared @xmath82 , the total energy per unit fermion number @xmath83 is an increasing function of @xmath84 .",
    "thus , when the f - ball fragments into smaller ones , the total energy apparently decreases . we therefore can not conclude that the electric force stabilizes the f - ball from fragmentation only by comparing the energies of the two states .",
    "morris , however , suggested @xcite that the inclusion of the long ranged repulsive force helps the f - ball to be stabilized .",
    "since it is not so clear whether the electric repulsive force stabilizes the f - ball or not , we here verify it using the perturbative method .    for this purpose",
    ", we investigate whether the energy barrier exists between the f - ball before the fragmentation and that after it .",
    "let us consider a spherical f - ball and its perturbative deformation from the spherical shape .",
    "assuming the rotational invariance around @xmath85-axis for simplicity , we express the surface of the f - ball in the polar coordinates as @xmath86 with @xmath87 a unit vector , @xmath88 we expand @xmath89 as @xmath90 where @xmath91 s are small coefficients of the perturbative expansion , and @xmath92 is the legendre polynomial .",
    "we write the surface element as @xmath93 with @xmath94 .",
    "we also expand the surface density of the fermion as @xmath95 where @xmath96 s are small expansion coefficients .",
    "note that the above expression satisfies the condition for the fermion number @xmath84 to be conserved ( see eq.([neu_nftot.eqn ] ) ) .    keeping the terms up to the second power of @xmath91 and @xmath96 ( see appendix [ unse.sec ] ) , we estimate , within the thin - wall approximation , the surface energy , @xmath97 the fermi energy , @xmath98 and the coulomb potential energy , @xmath99 where @xmath100 with @xmath101 . using the effective radius , @xmath102",
    "we express the total energy as @xmath103 where @xmath104 minimizing @xmath69 with respect to @xmath105 , we have @xmath106 with the effective radius , @xmath107    since the last term in the brackets @xmath108 in eq.([uns_e_2.eqn ] ) is semi - positive definite and zero only for @xmath109 and @xmath110 for @xmath111 , @xmath69 takes local minimum when the f - ball is spherical ( we note that the parameter @xmath112 corresponds to the small parallel displacement and not to the deformation of the f - ball ) .",
    "thus , the spherical f - ball is stable against the perturbative deformation from the spherical shape .",
    "it leads to the existence of the energy barrier and should suppress the fragmentation of the spherical f - ball . if the suppression of the fragmentation rate is strong , the f - balls would be effectively stable in the universe ( for the detailed discussion on their lifetime , see appendix [ uns_decay.sec ] ) and could be the candidates for cdm .",
    "however , if @xmath84 is very large , the f - ball should have such a strong electric field that should be quantum - mechanically screened by electrons or positrons with the screening length much shorter than the f - ball radius , as we see in the next section .",
    "therefore , the argument of this section can not be applied for the f - ball with very large @xmath84 .",
    "the argument of this section is applicable only for the f - balls with small @xmath84 , which have the radius much smaller than the screening length .",
    "such f - balls should give too large cosmic flux to be compatible with the present observations if the f - balls contribute sizably to cdm ( the more details are given in sec.[constraint.sec ] and ref.@xcite ) .",
    "we therefore find that the unscreened charged f - ball can not be a main component of cdm .",
    "in this section , we examine the stability of such a large f - ball that is electrically charged and screened due to the electrons produced quantum mechanically or thermally .",
    "we call the fermion trapped on the f - ball surface as a heavy fermion in order to distinguish it from the electron ; the heavy fermion is almost massless in the two dimensional surface while it is as heavy as @xmath113 in the true vacuum .",
    "the property of the screened f - ball is quite different from that of unscreened one , because the long ranged electric force becomes short ranged as a result of the screening .",
    "let us investigate the screening effect by introducing the coulomb potential energy @xmath114 for electron ( @xmath115 for positron ) with @xmath116 .",
    "we use the thomas - fermi method @xcite to deal with this problem .",
    "we see from eq.([scr_ve0.eqn ] ) that this condition is satisfied in the region near the surface where most of the electric charge is screened . ]",
    "the helmholtz free energy is expressed as @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the non - coulombic term that is the same as the energy for the neutral f - ball ( see sec.[neutral.sec ] ) .",

    "now let us extremize the free energy with respect to @xmath114 .",
    "assuming that the variation of @xmath114 in the direction parallel to the f - ball surface is much smaller than that in the normal direction , we get the thomas - fermi equation , @xmath130 where the symbol dot stands for the partial derivative with respect to @xmath23 . here",
