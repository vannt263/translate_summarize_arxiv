    "anderson predicted that , in a random medium , diffusion could disappear and waves stay localised @xcite . since then , _",
    "anderson localisation _ has played an important role to explain several properties of physical systems .",
    "there are many works on the mathematical side , starting with the simpler one dimension case in the beginning of the 80s . in dimension 3 , the first proof of anderson localisation was provided by frhlich and spencer @xcite who developed a method now called _",
    "multiscale analysis_. there are now other approaches which include for instance the _ fractional moment method _ proposed by aizenman and molchanov @xcite or the techniques proposed by imbrie @xcite .",
    "all these works are restricted to the one wave problem , which is well adapted to optics and acoustics . in condensed matter",
    ", the interaction between the particles is expected to play an important role and in this case one speaks of _ many - body localisation_. this question is not fully understood and is very actively studied in physics @xcite .",
    "a typical system of interest is a crystal composed of quantum electrons and classical nuclei placed on a random perturbation of a perfect lattice @xcite .",
    "this is a very complicated system since the coulomb interaction is long range and there are of the order of @xmath0 particles , usually mathematically treated as an infinite number .",
    "due to screening effects , the coulomb potential is often replaced by an effective short range interaction and this is what we are going to do in this work .    _",
    "finite _ interacting systems have been recently considered in several works @xcite but infinite systems have not been studied thoroughly .",
    "one should however mention a series of works on superfluidity and bose - einstein condensation in the lieb - liniger 1d bose gas in a strong random potential @xcite , and the very recent article of seiringer and warzel @xcite on the 1d tonks - girardeau gas .",
    "it is very hard to deal with the exact interacting schdinger problem for an infinite system .",
    "a useful and widespread approximation is the hartree - fock model , where the particles are treated as independent objects but see a field which depends on their own states and is then self - consistently optimised . for random systems",
    "this model has been recently introduced by e.  cancs , s.  lahbabi and m.  lewin in @xcite .",
    "the authors were able to construct a solution of the random nonlinear hartree - fock equation for an infinite system of fermions with short range interaction , but the phenomenon of anderson localisation was only investigated numerically in @xcite .    in this work , we complete this program in the case of a discrete system with a periodic background . in short , we show that the unique solution of the hartree - fock equation @xmath1 provides a mean - field operator @xmath2 which has exponentially localised eigenvectors , either on its whole spectrum or at the edges of its bands .",
    "our main assumption is that the periodic potential @xmath3 is sufficiently strong to create a gap for @xmath4 and that the random part @xmath5 as well as the interaction @xmath6 do not alter this gap .",
    "we take the chemical potential @xmath7 in this gap .",
    "our argument is to adapt the well known multiscale analysis in order to include the nonlinear terms .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in the next section",
    ", we properly define the discrete hartree - fock model and state our main localisation results .",
    "sections [ hamiltonianconstruction ] to [ smulti ] are devoted to the proof of our results .",
    "then in section [ snumeric ] we present some simple one dimensional numerical simulations in order to illustrate our findings .",
    "we also look at some cases which are not covered by our theorems and find , for instance , an interesting delocalisation phenomenon at the fermi level in the absence of a gap , which deserves further investigations .",
    "we consider a system of fermions on a subset @xmath8 of the lattice @xmath9 and which are submitted to an external potential @xmath10 . without interactions",
    "the system is described by the one - particle hamiltonian @xmath11 in the canonical basis @xmath12 of @xmath13 , the operator @xmath14 is defined by @xmath15 when @xmath8 is the whole lattice @xmath9 we will use the simpler notation @xmath16 .",
    "our theorems will actually hold for finite as well as for infinite domains .",
    "since @xmath17 will later be perturbed by a non linear term describing the interactions between the particles , we will often call @xmath17 the linear part .",
    "the potential @xmath10 describes a crystal lattice which is randomly perturbed .",
    "it is therefore assumed to be of the form @xmath18 where @xmath3 is a periodic potential ( of an arbitrary period ) and @xmath5 is a random potential .",
    "we use the anderson tight binding model where the value of @xmath5 is chosen independently at each site of @xmath8 with the same random probability law @xmath19 : @xmath20 here the @xmath21 are iid random variables .    under suitable regularity assumptions on @xmath19 , it is well known that @xmath17 displays anderson localisation .",
    "this means that there exist small intervals at the edges of the spectral bands where the spectrum is pure point with exponentially decaying eigenvectors ( `` lifshitz tail '' ) .",
    "moreover , if the random potential @xmath5 is strong enough ( compared to @xmath22 ) then the whole spectrum is pure point with localised eigenvectors .",
    "we will show that if the interactions between the particles are small enough then the same holds for the interacting model . before introducing interactions",
    ", we first discuss the precise assumptions that we will use for @xmath19 and @xmath3 .",
    "( a1 ) regularity of @xmath19 .",
    ": :    we assume that @xmath19 has a bounded support and that    it has a density @xmath23 with respect to the lebesgue    measure which is lipschitz by part .",
    "we think that this assumption can be weakened in several possible ways but we will not discuss this for the sake of simplicity . with no loss of generality , we can assume that @xmath24 .",
    "( a2 ) gap .",
    ": :    we assume that @xmath17 has a gap @xmath25 $ ] in its    ( deterministic ) spectrum .",
    "this assumption implies that the periodic potential @xmath3 is not constant and strong enough .",
    "indeed the spectrum of @xmath17 is almost surely equal to @xmath26 when the support of @xmath19 is an interval . in particular",
    "it is enough to assume that @xmath4 has a gap of size @xmath27 . when the domain @xmath8 is",
    "large enough then @xmath14 will have a gap as well .",
    "we call the size of the gap @xmath28 , and choose a chemical potential @xmath7 in the middle @xmath29 .",
