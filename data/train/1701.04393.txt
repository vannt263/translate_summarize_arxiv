    "the objective of the escape dynamics out of a metastable state has been thoroughly investigated since the seminal work of kramers  @xcite .",
    "a quantity of primary interest to establish the time scale of the escape dynamics of a classical brownian particle in the presence of a potential barrier is the mean first passage time ( mfpt ) ; i.e. the average time it takes for a particle driven by noise to reach a target position beyond an intervening barrier top  @xcite .",
    "the topic of evaluating the mfpt in the presence of external modulations of either stochastic or also deterministic nature has ample applications , among others , in neuronal models which are characterized by a time - varying voltage threshold ; e.g. see refs .",
    "@xcite . + a minimum occurring in the mfpt versus increasing frequency scale of the modulation is known in the literature as resonant activation .",
    "the phenomenon may emerge when the time scale of the barrier modulation matches the characteristic time scale of the escape dynamics .",
    "the phenomenon was originally predicted for a confining potential composed of a stylized piecewise linear , fluctuating barrier in ref .",
    "@xcite . soon after , the objective for the corresponding reaction rate dynamics in presence of general modulations of a metastable potential landscape has been investigated with a pioneering work in ref .",
    "@xcite ; cf .",
    "also the surveys on escape over fluctuating barriers   @xcite and investigations in ref .",
    "a similar phenomenon occurs if periodically varying modulations are acting : resonant activation emerges then due to the interplay between the nonstationary , deterministic barrier modulation and ambient environmental noise  @xcite .",
    "+ resonant activation constitutes therefore an archetypical feature for escape under deterministic modulations or fluctuations of a potential barrier .",
    "the general features of the mfpt as a function of the characteristic modulation frequency scale are a saturation to a maximal value for very slow modulations , where the highest barrier configuration dominates the barrier passage , followed by a decreasing behavior towards an intermediate nonadiabatic minimum  the resonant activation minimum  , and then by an increase towards a limiting high - frequency behavior , as determined by the corresponding averaged potential configuration  @xcite .",
    "+ with the present work we investigate the phenomenon of resonant activation for the archetype of the widely studied quantum dissipative two - state system ( tss )  @xcite , here driven by dichotomous noise and/or by a deterministic coherent field .",
    "this setup allows for a detailed investigation of the regime in which the barrier is not surmounted thermally but instead rather passed by dissipative quantum tunneling connecting the left- and right - well states of a double - well exhibiting a lowest energy doublet of energy separation @xmath1 . throughout the following",
    "we assume that this lowest doublet is well separated from higher lying quantum energy levels ; put differently , the presence of applied modulation is assumed not to excite appreciably higher lying quantum energies .",
    "+ the use of externally applied dichotomous noise modulations of the tunneling amplitude allows for an exact averaging over the noise realizations .",
    "this in turn yields a generalized non - markovian master equation that has been invoked previously to investigate the effects of correlated noise in electron transfer problems and tight - binding models  @xcite .",
    "+ given a quantum context , the concept of the mfpt generally presents , however , an unsolved subtle issue  @xcite .",
    "this has its origin in quantum mechanics , where position and momentum knowingly can not be sharply defined simultaneously .",
    "this issue is overcome , however , when investigating the incoherent tunneling regime . in the latter limit ,",
    "being realized by coupling the tss strongly to an environment , one is able to describe the tunneling dynamics in terms of a generally non - markovian quantum master equation for the left / right state probabilities with well - defined quantum transition rates .",
    "the resulting treatment then mimics ( in its markovian limit ) a classical discrete process  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the dynamics is governed by the quantum tunneling mechanism ; the effect of the environment being a renormalization of the bare tunneling amplitude . in such a situation a sensible statement of the problem of an absorbing boundary state in presence of generally time - dependent driving is feasible  @xcite . + in practical terms , the population dynamics in the tss may be realized when the passage of the system to the target state triggers a sudden modification of the potential , rendering the target state an absorbing state .",
    "an alternative setting , with the system composed of a particle coupled to a detector and a bath continuum of electromagnetic or phonon modes , has been discussed in ref .",
    "strong dissipation is experimentally also attained for tss systems characterized by macroscopic quantum tunneling such as occurring in superconducting flux qubits  @xcite .",
    "+ the strategy adopted in this study is based on the use of the corresponding , periodically modulated master equation approach to the time - dependent escape - dynamics  @xcite . in this master equation for the modulated tss we introduce the appropriate boundary conditions for reflection and absorption .",
    "particularly , we consider the case with the particle initially prepared in the ( reflecting ) left - well state and set as an absorbing state the neighboring right - well state . as a result",
    ", we end up with an equation for the so adjusted decay of the survival population @xmath2 of the left metastable state in terms of explicit time - dependent rates .",
    "the negative of the rate of change of @xmath2 then defines the first passage time density ,  correctly obeying the boundary conditions at all times  , whose first moment yields the searched for mfpt .",
    "+ in the case of dichotomous noise driving , it becomes possible to solve analytically the resulting master equation for the noise - averaged left - well population , at least in the case in which no time - periodic modulations are present .",
    "the latter situations does require a first passage analysis with arbitrary time - dependent transition rates entering the corresponding quantum master equation ; a situation that can be treated by numerical means only .",
    "+ our approach extends the amply studied case of the dissipative quantum dynamics for a tss to the situation with a quantum resonant activated escape regime .",
    "our findings display similar features as those observed for the mean residence time statistics occurring in modulated classical double - well systems where the barrier is thermally surmounted  @xcite .",
    "the obtained results therefore corroborate our expectation that the general phenomenon of resonant activation occurs likewise in the deep incoherent quantum regime .",
    "note also that this used setup distinctly differs from the stochastic schrdinger equation approach  @xcite and , alike , the approximated semiclassical approach  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the study of quantum resonant activation for a tss involves a dependence on a wide set of parameters ; it involves , besides the various driving parameters , also the strength and type of quantum dissipation , the temperature , and a suitably chosen dissipative high - frequency cut - off @xcite .",
    "this latter value is system - specific as it depends on the type of physics addressed with such a quantum tss  @xcite .",
    "as a model of driven dissipative quantum dynamics being composed of two metastable quantum states , we consider the archetypical spin - boson model  @xcite in which a quantum two - state system @xmath3 is coupled to a heat bath @xmath4 , with the latter made up of independent bosonic modes of frequencies @xmath5 ( caldeira - leggett model )  @xcite . the coupling to the bath occurs via a scaled position operator which , in the localized basis @xmath6 of a truncated double - well system , is represented by @xmath7 .",

    "the quantum dynamics proceeds incoherently so that an effective classical description in terms of a master equation with incoherent quantum rates becomes feasible .",
    "this in turn allows for studying the detailed first passage time statistics when initially starting out at one of the two metastable states and with absorption occurring at the neighboring quantum state .",

    "this quantity displays the typical signatures of resonant activation , i.e. the existence of an intermediate modulation regime where the mfpt undrerruns the values assumed in the opposite limits of adiabatic slow driving and high frequency modulation . in the limit of very high frequency modulation one approaches the non - driven mfpt value .",
    "+ our findings for various modulation settings corroborate the _ universal _ behavior @xcite found for classical over - the - barrier - resonant - activation , where ( i ) at low frequencies the mfpt is dominated by the adiabatic configuration , with the largest possible passage time ruling the overall escape , while ( ii ) for high frequency modulations the mfpt is governed by the value of the time - averaged energy profile  yielding typically the static mfpt value  ; ( iii ) for barrier modulations driven at intermediate time - scales ( of the order of the system dynamics time scale ) the regime with minimal mfpt values emerges ( resonant activation regime ) where the mfpt underruns both limits .",
    "this so modulated tss possesses a wide parameter region for the two quantum transition rates .",
    "this allows one to engineer the regime of resonant activation towards either smaller or also ( more interestingly ) much wider regimes .",
