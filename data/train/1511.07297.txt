    "pentagon chains as main representatives of conjugated polymers which have conducting properties have broad application possibilities covering several fields . starting from the nobel prize awarded to the subject in 2000 , in 15 years",
    "several technological applications have emerged , such as energy storage @xcite , solar cells @xcite , or sustained drug release @xcite , which are now considered classical .",
    "but besides these , several other application possibilities are present as rechargeable batteries , electrochromic displays , information memory , anti - static materials , anti - corrosives , electrocatalysis , sensors , electromechanical devices , infra - red polarizers @xcite , bioanalytical sensors @xcite , or biocontacts @xcite .",
    "in addition to these , there are several other applications related explicitly to the action of external ( magnetic and/or electric ) fields on the conducting polymer of pentagon chain type . in order to exemplify , we mention the applications related to pseudocapacitor electrodes @xcite , fabrication of cell layers creating in vivo electric fields @xcite , radar or microwave absorbing materials which converts the electromagnetic energy into heat @xcite , electrods for battery applications @xcite , artificial muscles based on actuators with large strain and stress induced electrically @xcite , photothermal agents @xcite , covering layers for magnetic nanoparticles @xcite , or transport mediators in liquid electrolites @xcite .",
    "contrary to this technological interest , the action of external electric and/or magnetic fields on pentagon chains has not been analyzed et all on microscopic level .",
    "the present paper tries to fill up at least partially this gap by reporting a detailed study of the action of external magnetic and electric fields on pentagon chains at microscopic level .",
    "we mention that pentagon chains in the absence of external fields have been intensively analyzed in the last period . using technical steps presented in details in ref .",
    "@xcite , the high concentration limit has been described @xcite , and the low concentration limit has been investigated @xcite .",
    "inspite of the fact that these systems are non - integrable , and strongly correlated @xcite where the on - site coulomb repulsion may even be as large as 10 ev @xcite , the method used is special and provides exact results @xcite .",
    "the strategy is to transcribe the hamiltonian in exact terms into a positive semidefinite form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a positive semidefinite operator while @xmath2 is a scalar , and in a second step to find the exact ground state by constructing the most general solution of the equation @xmath3 . by deducing total particle number ( @xmath4 ) dependent ground states in this manner ,",
    "we can find exact result relating the low lying part of the excitation spectrum as well , e.g. via the n - dependent chemical potential .",
    "the technique itself has been successfully used previously in characterizing different non - integrable quantum many - body systems as periodic anderson model ( pam ) in one @xcite , two @xcite , and three @xcite dimensions , non - integrable chain structures @xcite , two dimensional effects as stripe or droplet formation @xcite , delocalization effect of the interaction @xcite , or even study of the effect of randomness @xcite .    using the above presented procedure , in the present paper",

    "we investigate pentagon chains described by hubbard type of hamiltonians in external magnetic and electric fields .",
    "the system is in fact a conducting and organic polymer with pentagon cell not containing magnetic atoms at all .",
    "the external magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the cell is taken into account via peierls phase factors multiplying the hopping terms of the hamiltonian , while the external electric fields by site selective electric potentials modifying the on - site one - particle potentials . in the presented conditions",
    "one shows that the external fields have a substantial effect on the physical properties of the chains .",
    "first , this modifies considerably the bare band structure of the system provided by the one - particle part of the hamiltonian , and second , the emergence domains of condensed phases are also redrawn .",
    "we exemplify this by deducing ferromagnetic ground states in two different regions of the parameter space and show that the parameter space domain where the ordered phase occurs is doubled .",
    "since the studied system is non - integrable and strongly correlated , the deduction process of the multielectronic ground states is non - approximated , and is based on a technique which transforms the hamiltonian in a positive semidefinite form .",

    "the calculation of the peierls phase factors is performed by using eq.([ue1 ] ) . for the vector potential one uses the landau gauge expression , namely @xmath168 , where @xmath169 , and the used system of coordinates @xmath170",
