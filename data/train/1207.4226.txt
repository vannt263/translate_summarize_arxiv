    "figure  [ fig : sfig1 ] shows a detailed schematic of the experimental setup used for photon correlation and two - photon interference measurements before and after frequency conversion of a single qd state .",
    "the individual sub - systems within this setup are described below .",
    "our source of single photons consists of an inas quantum dot ( qd ) in a 190  nm thick , 2.9  @xmath8 m diameter gaas microdisk cavity . in this work ,",
    "the coupling between the modes of the cavity and the qd emission lines is weak , and any radiative rate enhancement or inhibition is relatively small ( @xmath36  x ) .",
    "qd emission is out - coupled from the microdisk cavity using an optical fiber taper waveguide ( ftw ) , which provides a convenient single mode fiber interface for subsequent experiments .",
    "the sample is cooled in a liquid he flow cryostat , and a sample temperature between 7  k and 10  k is maintained during all experiments .",
    "emission that is out - coupled by the ftw is sent into a filtering setup consisting of a @xmath00.2  nm bandwidth volume reflective bragg grating ( bpf in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfig1 ] ) whose input is coupled to single mode optical fiber and output is coupled to polarization maintaining ( pm ) single mode fiber .",
    "quarter- and half - wave plates and a polarizing beamsplitter are placed prior to the pm fiber input , to ensure that light is linearly polarized along the slow - axis of the fiber .",
    "the typical throughput of the filtering setup is between 50@xmath7 and 60@xmath7 .      in the frequency conversion setup ,",
    "we use a wavelength division multiplexer ( wdm ) to combine the spectrally - filtered qd emission with a strong ( few hundred mw ) 1550 nm pump signal that is generated by an external cavity tunable diode laser and erbium - doped fiber amplifier ( edfa ) .",
    "fiber polarization controllers ( fpcs ) are used to adjust the polarization state of both the 980 nm and 1550 nm beams .",
    "the combined signal and pump are coupled into a 2 cm long , 5  @xmath6 mgo - doped ppln waveguide whose temperature can be adjusted between 25  @xmath37c and 90  @xmath37c with 0.1  @xmath37c resolution .",
    "light is coupled into the waveguide through a cleaved single mode optical fiber that is controlled by a 3-axis open - loop piezo stage and has a mode - field diameter of 5.8@xmath8 m at 980 nm .",
    "the coupling is optimized for the 980 nm band signal , at the expense of the 1550 nm pump ( additional pump power compensates for the 1550 nm coupling inefficiency ) .",
    "light exiting the ppln waveguide is collimated and sent through two dispersive prisms and two 750 nm short pass edge filters ( spfs ) to eliminate residual 1550 nm pump photons and frequency doubled 775 nm pump photons from the signal .",
    "after filtering , the upconverted signal is usually coupled into a pm single mode fiber .",
    "we place a polarizing beamsplitter prior to the pm fiber output to ensure that light is linearly polarized along the slow - axis of the fiber ( waveplates are not needed because the output of the ppln waveguide is very close to linearly polarized ) .",
    "the external conversion efficiency of the setup is as high as @xmath040  @xmath6 , including all losses in the system other than the final single mode fiber coupling , which has a typical efficiency of 30  @xmath6 . in some experiments ( i.e.",
    ", ones in which the spatial mode profile of the light is unimportant ) , multimode fiber coupling is preferred , due to its higher coupling efficiency of 85  @xmath6 .",
    "the overall detection efficiency of the frequency conversion system is given as the product of the external conversion efficiency , the fiber coupling efficiency , and detector quantum efficiency ( @xmath067  @xmath6 at 600  nm for a thick si single - photon avalanche diode ) .",
    "three different types of si single - photon avalanche diodes ( spads ) are used in the experiments , depending on the requirements on detection efficiency and timing resolution .",
    "thick si spads used in this work have a detection efficiency of @xmath012.5  @xmath6 ( 67  @xmath6 ) at 980  nm ( 600  nm ) and a timing jitter @xmath2500  ps , and are used in experiments in which high timing resolution are not needed .",
    "thin si spads  @xcite have a detection efficiency of @xmath02  @xmath6 ( 45  @xmath6 ) at 980  nm ( 600  nm ) , and a timing jitter of @xmath050  ps .",
    "newly - developed red - enhanced si spads  @xcite have a detection efficiency of @xmath06  @xmath6 ( 55  @xmath6 ) at 980  nm ( 600  nm ) , and a timing jitter of @xmath0100  ps .    as evident from these efficiency and timing jitter values ,",
    "an advantage of using frequency conversion to the 600  nm band is the potential to simultaneously achieve high quantum efficiency ( @xmath38 ) and low timing jitter ( @xmath39  ps ) , which is currently not possible in the 980  nm band using si spad technology .      in pulsed measurements ,",
    "the qd is pumped with a gain - switched 780  nm laser diode operating with a 50mhz repetition rate and 50ps pulse width .",
    "prior to frequency conversion , spectrally - isolated qd emission is split using a 1x2 fiber splitter , and each output of the splitter is sent to a thick si spad .",
    "the spad outputs are sent to a time - correlated single photon counting ( tcspc ) system with a bin size of 512  ps , and histogram data is acquired to measure the second - order intensity correlation function @xmath40 .",
    "measurements after frequency conversion are performed in a similar fashion , with the output of the frequency conversion setup directed to a 1x2 fiber splitter , and subsequently , into thick si spads and the tscpc .",
    "continuous wave ( cw ) measurements are performed in a manner similar to that used for pulsed measurements , with the following exceptions : ( 1 ) a 780  cw laser is used to excite the qd .",
    "( 2 ) high timing resolution spads and a smaller tcspc histogramming bin width are used . for measurements before frequency conversion , two red - enhanced si spads are used , and the bin size of the tcspc is set to 256  ps .    for measurements after frequency conversion , one red - enhanced si spad and one thin si spad are used , and the bin size of the tcspc is set to 256  ps .",
    "two - photon interference measurements are performed using mach - zehnder interferometers for the 980  nm band ( before conversion ) and 600  nm band ( after conversion ) .",
    "each interferometer starts with a pm - fiber - coupled beamsplitter ( fbs in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfig1 ] ) .",
    "one output of the fbs is connected directly into the first input port of a second fbs , while the other output goes through a fiber - coupled polarization rotator ( fpr ) before being connected to the second input port of the second fbs .",
    "the fpr can be rotated to allow both maximum interference ( parallel configuration ) or minimum interference ( orthogonal configuration ) , and its input and output cables provide a delay of 12.5  ns with respect to the other arm of the interferometer .    for measurements done before frequency conversion , the outputs of the 980  nm band hong - ou - mandel setup are detected with the two red - enhanced si spads . for measurements after frequency conversion , one red - enhanced si spad and one thin si spad",
    "are used , and the outputs are sent to the tcspc .",
    "data is acquired in a time - tagged , time - resolved mode in which the photon arrival times from each channel are recorded with 4  ps timing resolution and the bin size set during subsequent data analysis . here , a bin size of 125  ps was used for measurements before and after conversion .          the experimental setup used for studying the frequency conversion of two spectrally - separate qd states",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfig2 ] . prior to conversion , we perform cross - correlation measurements by spectrally isolating lines x1 and x2 using reflective volume gratings whose outputs are coupled to single mode optical fibers .",
    "the fibers are connected to red - enhanced si spads , whose outputs are fed into the tcspc . data is acquired in time - tagged , time - resolved mode and a bin size of 50  ps was used in analyzing the data .    to frequency convert states x1 and x2 to the same wavelength in the 600  nm band , two 1550  nm band external cavity diode lasers",
    "are separately amplified and combined with lines x1 and x2 in the ppln waveguide .",
    "each 1550  nm laser is tuned to maximize the frequency conversion of the corresponding qd state , and the output of the ppln waveguide is spectrally resolved to determine the precise wavelength to which light is converted .",
    "fine tuning of the 1550  nm wavelengths is performed to ensure that both states are converted to the same wavelength ( within the resolution of the grating spectrometer ) .",
    "this adjustment can come at the expense of conversion efficiency ( in practice , we sacrifice on the conversion efficiency of state x1 , since it is brighter ) .",
    "the combined frequency converted light from states x1 and x2 is coupled into a single mode pm fiber and split using a 1x2 fiber splitter , with the arms of the splitter hooked up to a red - enhanced si spad and a thin si spad .",
    "data is acquired in time - tagged , time - resolved mode and a bin size of 50  ps was used in the data analysis .",
    "two - photon interference of two qd states follows the same procedure as above , where both states are frequency converted to the same wavelength in a single ppln waveguide .",
    "the combined frequency converted light from the two states is sent to a mach - zehnder interferometer ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sfig2 ] ) , and the outputs of the interferometer are hooked up to a red - enhanced si spad and a thin si spad .",
    "data is acquired in time - tagged , time - resolved mode , and due to the relatively low photon count rates in this measurement ( more details are given in the final section below ) , a bin size of 250  ps was used in analysis of the data .",
    "we measure the quasi - phase - matching bandwidth of the ppln waveguide as follows .",
    "the weak signal produced by a narrow linewidth ( @xmath415mhz ) laser is fixed at 983.8  nm , and the temperature of the ppln waveguide is set to 58.8  @xmath37c .",
    "next , the 1550 nm pump power is set to @xmath0800mw , close to the value at which we achieve optimal conversion efficiency .",
    "we then scan the 1550 nm pump wavelength while monitoring the frequency converted 600 nm band signal on a thick si spad .",
    "this generates the plot shown in the inset to fig .",
    "we infer the 980  nm quasi - phase - matching bandwidth based upon energy conservation and the 1550  nm wavelengths .",
    "adjusting the temperature of the ppln waveguide provides a mechanism to tune the output wavelength of the frequency conversion process . at each ppln waveguide temperature , we keep the input signal fixed at 983.8 nm and scan the 1550  nm laser , recording the 1550  nm wavelength at which the conversion efficiency is maximized . using this 1550  nm wavelength and",
    "the requirement of energy conservation produces the plot of frequency converted wavelength against temperature in fig .",

    "signal - to - background measurements are performed using a thick si spad placed after the prisms and spfs , and with a 1550  nm band pump beam whose average power at the input of the 980/1550  nm wdm varies between 0  w and 1.2  w. the converted signal was measured using a weak 980  nm band input signal produced by an attenuated laser .",
    "the output average power level is set to be consistent with that of the qd single photon sources under investigation ( @xmath030  fw ) , while the background level was determined by switching off the 980  nm laser .",
    "the dark count rate of the spad ( @xmath050  s@xmath5 ) was subtracted from both the converted signal and background levels , to provide a metric that is independent of the characteristics of the detector .",
    "the error bars in fig .",
    "1(c ) are one standard deviation values and are due to fluctuations in the detected count rate on the spad .",
    "lifetime measurements reveal a radiative lifetime of @xmath42  1  ns for device m1 , while devices m2 and m3 show longer lifetimes of @xmath01.5  ns and @xmath43  ns , respectively .",
    "these measurements are performed using the 780  nm pulsed laser , with the electronic trigger output of the laser fed to the first channel of the tcspc , and the detected signal from a red - enhanced si spad fed to the second channel .",
    "measurement of the second - order correlation function @xmath40 are performed using the setups described above . in pulsed measurements ,",
    "the @xmath11 value is determined by comparing the integrated area of the peak around time zero to the average area of the peaks away from time zero .",

    "@xmath40 under cw excitation is normalized to the coincidence rate at long time delays ( @xmath44  ns ) .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath11 is due to the fluctuation in coincidence rate for @xmath44  ns , and is the one standard deviation value .",
    "measurements are run for a long enough time for the poissonian levels to reach a minimum of 80 coincidences .",
    "two - photon interference experiments on device m2 are performed using the setups described above .",
    "the correlation functions at the output of the mach - zehnder interferometers under parallel and orthogonal polarizations of the photons , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , are normalized to the coincidence rate at long time delays ( @xmath44  ns ) .",

    "measurements are run for a long enough time for the poissonian levels to reach a minimum of 100 coincidences .    to aid in the analysis of the two - photon interference data , we follow the procedure of refs .   and  .",
    "first , we consider that in the limit of no timing resolution limitations , the second - order correlation function @xmath40 is of the form :      where @xmath49 is the radiative lifetime of the qd state , and @xmath50 accounts for potential multi - photon contributions to the data ( i.e. , that lead to a non - zero value of @xmath11 ) .",
    "the timing resolution of the spads and tcspc are taken into account by convolving eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq1 ] ) with the spad instrument response function and binning the result over a time window equal to the time bin set on the tcspc .    using the above approach",
    ", we fit the cw @xmath40 data , as shown in the dashed lines in fig .",
    "3(a ) and ( d ) .",
    "the values we extract for @xmath50 ( @xmath00.1 ) and @xmath49 ( @xmath01.5  ns ) are then used with eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq1 ] ) in formulas for @xmath45 and @xmath46  [ ] :        @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the reflection and transmission intensity coefficients at the two beamsplitters , which we assume to be 0.5 for all of the beamsplitters in use .",
    "@xmath55 is the spatial overlap of the photon wavepackets at the second beamsplitter , which we assume to be unity , and @xmath56 is the delay in the fiber - coupled mach - zehnder interferometer , which is @xmath012.5  ns .",
    "accounting for the timing resolution of the spads and tcspc in the same way as described above for @xmath40 , we produce the dashed line curves shown in fig . 3(b),(c ) and ( e),(f ) . the extracted coherence time @xmath57  ps is consistent with independent measurements of coherence time for qds under 780  nm excitation on this sample , which show a range of values between @xmath075  ps and 250  ps .",

    "the difference in @xmath11 values between x1 and x2 arises from the relative position of the two states with respect to a broad cavity mode , which is more closely aligned with state x2 .",
    "this also influences the radiative lifetime of the two states , as clearly visible in the correlation data in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfig3 ] .    two - photon interference of the frequency converted signal from the states x1 and x2 is performed using the 600  nm mach - zehnder interferometer ( fig .",

    "the fiber - coupled polarization rotator is removed in the parallel polarization configuration ( since the polarization is correctly aligned without it ) , and the resulting delay between the two arms of the interferometer is 2.2  ns . in addition , a bin size of 250  ps is used in analyzing the time - tagged , time - resolved data , which was acquired for 2.5  h to produce the data in fig .",
    "5(b)-(c ) .",
    "the data is fit using the same approach as described in the single state two - photon interference section , but now with @xmath32=2.2  ns . because @xmath62 ( in part due to the relatively long lifetimes of the states involved , with @xmath63  ns ) , the value of @xmath11 in the perpendicular polarization configuration , @xmath64 , can be less than 0.5 , which is what one typically predicts for this non - interfering configuration in the case of a pure single photon source  @xcite .",
    "non - zero multiphoton probability ( i.e. , @xmath65 ) will also influence @xmath64 . our best estimates of @xmath66  ns , @xmath67 , and @xmath68=200",
    "ps yield the red solid curve ( parallel polarization configuration ) and black dashed line ( orthogonal polarization configuration ) in fig .",
    "this gives @xmath35 , and even if infinite timing resolution of the detectors and @xmath69 are assumed , @xmath31 .",
    "the significant reduction measured in the parallel polarization configuration , with @xmath30 , is thus attributed to the two - photon interference effect .",
    "future improvements to the setup will likely require improved optical losses .",
    "extra losses within the setup relative to the two - photon interference of a single qd state include : ( 1 ) the necessity to achieve precise spectral matching of the upconverted wavelength , which requires fine tuning of the two 1550  nm pump lasers away from the peak conversion wavelengths , ( 2 ) the limited 1550  nm band pump power available due to the directional coupler used to combine the two pump signals , which limits the power in any one pump field to @xmath0  500  mw and prevents operation at the peak of the external conversion efficiency curve of fig.1(c ) , and ( 3 ) the directional coupler used to combine the x1 and x2 emission after spectral filtering , which automatically adds 3  db of loss due to the unused output port .",
    "improvement in the losses of the fiber - coupled beamsplitters ( @xmath23  db total ) and the single mode fiber coupling at the output of the ppln waveguide ( 5.2  db ) ( also present in the single state two - photon interference experiment ) would also help improve the signal - to - noise level in the measurements ."

    "<S> this enables the conversion of well - separated emission lines to the same wavelength at 600 nm . to demonstrate this , both bright emission lines x1 and x2 from device m2 ( @xmath8-pl spectrum repeated in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> to better understand the nature of the measured emission lines , a cross - correlation measurement was performed before frequency conversion , where the spectrally filtered x1 and x2 lines were sent to the stop and start channels of the hbt setup , respectively . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig4](b ) , a strong asymmetric antibunching dip is observed with @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the antibunching shows that both emission lines originate from the same qd , while the asymmetry is related to the radiative dynamics within the qd . </S>",
    "<S> the faster recovery time for @xmath26 can be explained if x1 and x2 arise from neutral and charged excitonic emission , respectively  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this effect arises because emission of the charged exciton x2 leaves the qd with a single charge , so that subsequent emission in the neutral exciton state x1 requires capture of only a single ( opposite ) charge . </S>",
    "<S> this yields a much faster recovery time than that needed to obtain three charges in the qd , which sets the recovery time for @xmath27 .    </S>",

    "<S> as expected , a strong antibunching dip with @xmath28 is observed . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the cross - correlation measurement before conversion , the antibunching dip now has a symmetric shape . </S>",
    "<S> this arises from the fact that both qd states were converted within a single ppln waveguide , so that in the subsequent hbt measurement , the start and stop channels are fed by the same signal at 600 nm , which was composed of both x1 and x2 emission lines . </S>",

    "<S> we work with device m3 , whose spectrum is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig5](a ) , and which was chosen because the two excitonic states x1 and x2 have relatively similar intensities . </S>",
    "<S> cross - correlation measurements  @xcite similar to those described above were performed to confirm that both states come from the same qd . after this , the two states were converted to the same 600  nm wavelength as above , and the combined frequency converted signal was sent into a mach - zehnder interferometer similar to that used earlier . </S>",

    "<S> this is smaller than the typical value of 0.5  @xcite due to the delay @xmath32=2.2  ns between the interferometer arms , which is comparable to the average radiative lifetime @xmath33=1.7  ns of the two states . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account the non - zero value @xmath34 and the finite timing resolution of the setup , @xmath35 is estimated  @xcite , far exceeding the measured value @xmath30 , and indicating the significant effect of two - photon interference from the two frequency - converted qd states .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated background - free quantum frequency conversion of single photons emitted from a quantum dot . </S>",
    "<S> photons at 980 nm are converted to 600 nm with a signal - to - background larger than 100 and external conversion efficiency of 40% . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that single photon purity and wavepacket interference are preserved during frequency conversion , and demonstrate that spectrally distinct qd emission lines can be converted to the same wavelength in the ppln waveguide . </S>",
