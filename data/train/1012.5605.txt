    "by extending the concept of bose - einstein condensate to gravitational systems , mazur and mottola @xcite have proposed a new solution for the endpoint of a gravitational collapse in the form of cold , dark , compact objects known as _",
    "gravastars_. these contain an isotropic de sitter vacuum in the interior , while the exterior is defined by a schwarzschild geometry , separated by a thin shell of stiff matter of arbitrary total mass @xmath0 .",
    "this model implies that the space of a gravastar has three different regions with different equations of state ( eos ) @xcite , as defined as follows :    i. interior : @xmath1 ,  @xmath2 ,    \\ii .",
    "shell : @xmath3 ,  @xmath4 ,    \\iii .",
    "exterior : @xmath5 ,  @xmath6here @xmath7 is the thickness of the shell .",
    "the presence of matter on the thin shell is required to achieve the crucial stability of such systems under expansion by exerting an inward force to balance the repulsion from within .",
    "building on this background , we propose a new model of a gravastar admitting conformal motion by assuming a charged interior but with an exterior defined by a reissner - nordstrm line element instead of schwarzschild .",
    "the basic motivation for this model is that , in general , compact stars tend to have a net charge on the surface  @xcite .",
    "this is an essential consideration in the study of the stability of a fluid sphere ; in fact , it has been argued  @xcite that a spherical fluid distribution of uniform density with a net surface charge is more stable than a surface without charge . according to de felice et al .",
    "@xcite , the inclusion of charge inhibits the growth of spacetime curvature and which therefore plays a key role in avoiding singularities .",
    "it has also been argued that gravitational collapse can be averted in the presence of a charge since the gravitational attraction may be counter - balanced by the electrical repulsion ( in addition to the pressure gradient  @xcite . )    in searching for a natural relationship between geometry and matter for such stars through the einstein field equations , we take into account the well - known inheritance symmetry .",
    "this symmetry is contained in the set of conformal killing vectors ( ckv ) @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the lie derivative operator and @xmath10 is the conformal factor .",
    "it is supposed that the vector @xmath11 generates the conformal symmetry and the metric @xmath12 is conformally mapped onto itself along @xmath11 .",
    "neither @xmath11 nor @xmath10 need to be static , even in the case of a static metric  @xcite . due to this and other properties ,",
    "ckvs have provided a deeper insight into the spacetime geometry connected to the astrophysical and cosmological realm  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown by ray et al .",
    "@xcite that , under the conformal killing - vectors approach , charged fluid spheres provide _ electromagnetic mass ( emm ) _ models in which gravitational mass and other physical parameters originate solely from the electromagnetic field .",
    "so one of the motivations in the present investigation is to include ckvs and see to what extent conformal motion admits emm models along with other relevant physical features .",

    "@xmath51 , it follows from the eq .",
    "( [ key1 ] ) that the value of @xmath10 turns out to be either @xmath52 or @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is a dimensionless integration constant .",
    "this leads to the following exact analytical forms for all of the parameters : @xmath55 here @xmath56 is a constant , which has the inverse dimension of @xmath41 .",

    "thus for the purpose of gravastar physics , our above solutions are assumed to obey the condition @xmath63 .    for @xmath64 , we find that both @xmath17 and @xmath16 are inversely proportional to @xmath65 but with opposite signs for their proportionality constants .",

    "let us now match the interior solution to the exterior reissner - nordstrm solution at the boundary in the customary manner .",
    "to do so , we have to keep in mind that instead of a solid sphere , we are dealing here with a bubble - like hollow sphere of radius @xmath75 , so that for the limit @xmath76 , we have the de sitter spherical void of radius @xmath77 .",

    "in other words , the interior de sitter void ( @xmath89 ) in a charged gravastar is the same as in the case already addressed by ray et al .",
    "this implies that the interior de sitter void of a charged gravastar must , in analogous fashion , generate the gravitational mass .",
    "this particular feature is a new one and was not obtainable in the non - charged case of mazur and mottola  @xcite .",
    "this mass provides the attractive force resulting from the collapse of the sphere and counter - balances the repulsive force due to electromagnetic field .",
    "it is worth noting that the equation of state @xmath89 ( known in the literature as a false vacuum , degenerate vacuum , or @xmath16-vacuum",
    "@xcite ) represents a repulsive pressure which in the context of an accelerating universe may be related to the _ @xmath90-dark energy _ , an agent responsible for the second phase of the inflation  @xcite .",
    "so the _ charged gravastar _ seems to be connected to the _ dark star _  @xcite .      using the eos @xmath91",

    "we observe that the above solutions for the shell of the gravastar are valid within the range @xmath100 .",
    "it is obvious from eq .",
