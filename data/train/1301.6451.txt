    "<S> first , we focus on matroids and give a general construction that generates a @xmath0-dimensional point configuration with a matroidal symmetry that can not be realized as a geometric symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the construction is motivated by the fact that every non - trivial rotation in the @xmath1-dimensional euclidean space has a unique fixed point but there is no corresponding property for matroids . </S>",
    "<S> the construction suggests that the lack of the fixed point theorem generates a big gap between matroidal symmetries and geometric symmetries of point configurations . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by this insight , we investigate some fixed point properties for oriented matroids . </S>",
    "<S> we develop some fixed point theorems for oriented matroids and then make classification of rotational symmetry groups of simple acyclic oriented matroids of rank @xmath2 as an application . </S>"
