    "this review article starts with the kaon - side story of cp violation .",
    "after the @xmath0 decay was discovered  @xcite in 1964 and the cp asymmetry in the @xmath1 mixing was established  @xcite , a long - standing problem has been its origin ; the first question was whether it was due to the @xmath2 _ superweak _ transition  @xcite or not . in 1973 ,",
    "kobayashi and maskawa  @xcite accommodated cp violation in the electroweak theory with six quarks ( and single complex - phase ) .",
    "the kobayashi - maskawa theory  @xcite , including the prediction of _ direct _ cp violation in the decay process from the cp - odd component ( @xmath3 ) to the cp - even state ( @xmath4 ) , was verified by the observations of time - reversal non - invariance ( cplear  @xcite at cern ) and finite @xmath5 ( na48 at cern and ktev at fnal ) as well as the discoveries of top quark and cp - violating b decays .",
    "the ktev collaboration reported the final measurement of @xmath6 with their entire data set : @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "combining all the measurements including the final result from na48 : @xmath8  @xcite , the world average is @xmath9  @xcite ; it clearly demonstrates the existence of direct cp violation .",
    "however , due to theoretical uncertainties in the hadronic matrix elements , to get information on the standard model and new physics beyond it from @xmath6 is difficult and remains to be a challenge to lattice qcd calculations  @xcite .    in the modern classification  @xcite cp violation",
    "is grouped into three : in _ mixing _ , _ decay _ , and _ interference between decays with and without mixing_. all of these have been extensively studied in the b factory experiments , while the study of cp violation in the charged - kaon decay modes started recently .",
    "the na48/2 experiment at cern performed charge asymmetry measurements with the simultaneous @xmath10 beams of @xmath11 gev/@xmath12 in 2003 and 2004 .",
    "the asymmetries of the linear slope parameter in the matrix element expansion of the @xmath13 decay and the @xmath14 decay were measured to be @xmath15 and @xmath16 with the data sets of 4 g and 0.1 g events , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the standard model expectation is in @xmath17 , and no evidence for cp violation in _ decay _ was observed at the level of @xmath18 .",
    "na48/2 also measured the asymmetries of @xmath19 and @xmath20 decay - widths in @xmath21 and @xmath22 to be @xmath23  @xcite and @xmath24  @xcite and set the upper limits of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "the cp - violating processes in _ mixing _ and _ decay _ suffers from hadronic uncertainties .",
    "in contrast , the cp violation in _ interference between decays with and without mixing _ is theoretically clean , and the decay @xmath27",
    "@xcite is known to be a golden mode in this category  @xcite because the branching ratio can be calculated with very small theoretical - uncertainties in the standard model as well as in new physics .",
    "measurement of the branching ratios for @xmath28 and for the charged counterpart @xmath29 is the main issue in the near future plans of kaon physics , and is the topics of the next section .",
    "the @xmath30 decay  @xcite is a flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) process and is induced by the electroweak loop effects as penguin and box diagrams .",
    "the decay is suppressed in the standard model , and the branching ratios are predicted as @xmath31 and @xmath32  @xcite , in which the uncertainties are dominated by the allowed range of the quark - mixing matrix elements .",
    "long - distance contributions are small , the hadronic matrix elements are extracted from the @xmath33 decay  @xcite , and the next - to - next - to - leading order qcd corrections  @xcite and the qed and electroweak corrections  @xcite to the charm quark contribution to @xmath29 have been calculated .",
    "new physics could affect these branching ratios  @xcite and , by the measurement , the flavor structure in new physics ( operators and phases in the interactions of new particles ) can be studied .",
    "the @xmath30 branching ratios beyond the standard model are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : krare_bsm_new ] . a model - independent bound @xmath34",

    "the signature of @xmath30 is a kaon decay into _ a pion plus nothing_. background rejection is essential in these experiments , and _ blind analysis _",
    "techniques have been developed and refined to achieve a high level of confidence in the background measurements . to verify _ nothing _ , hermetic extra - particle detection by photon and charged - particle detectors , called the _",
    ", is imposed to the hits in coincidence with the pion time and with the energy threshold less than a few mev .",
    "tight veto requirements are indispensable in order to achieve a low detection - inefficiency @xmath35 ; good timing resolution for low energy hits is therefore essential to avoid acceptance loss due to accidental hits .",
    "the e391a experiment at kek was the first dedicated search for the @xmath36 decay . a small - diameter neutral beam ( called a _ pencil _",
    "beam  @xcite ) was developed and constructed .",
    "the @xmath37 beam whose momentum peaked at 2 gev/@xmath12 was produced by the 12-gev proton synchrotron ( kek - ps ) .",
    "the energy and position of the two photons from @xmath38 decays were measured by a downstream calorimeter .",
    "the @xmath37-decay vertex position along the beam line was determined from the constraint of @xmath38 mass , and a @xmath38 with a large transverse momentum ( @xmath39 0.12 gev/@xmath12 ) was the signal .",
    "the remaining part of the calorimeter not hit by the two photons and the other detector subsystems that covered the decay region were used as a veto , which was crucial to suppress the major background from @xmath40 .",
    "the beam line and the collimation scheme were designed carefully to minimize the beam halo ( mostly neutrons ) , which could interact with the counters near the beam and produce @xmath38 s and @xmath41 s .",
    "final results from e391a on @xmath36 were published recently  @xcite . combining the data sets from february - april and october - december 2005 , the single event sensitivity was @xmath42 and no events",
    "were observed inside the signal region ( fig .",

    "the upper limit on @xmath43 was set to be @xmath44 at the 90% confidence level ( c.l . ) .",

    "charged - particle detectors for measurement of the @xmath46 properties were located in the central region of the detector and were surrounded by hermetic photon detectors .",
    "the @xmath46 momentum ( @xmath47 ) from @xmath45 is less than 0.227 gev/@xmath12 , while the major background sources of @xmath48 and @xmath49 are two - body decays and have monochromatic momentum of 0.205 gev/@xmath12 and 0.236 gev/@xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath46 momentum regions above and below the peak from @xmath48 were adopted .",
    "redundant kinematic measurement and @xmath50 rejection were employed ; the latter was crucial because the @xmath49 background had the same topology as the signal .",
    "pion contamination to the incident @xmath19 beam ( 0.7 gev/@xmath12 ) was reduced by two stages of electrostatic particle separation in the beam line to prevent the background due to scattered beam pions .",
    "the e949 experiment observed one @xmath45 event in the kinematic region @xmath51 gev/@xmath12 ( pnn1 )  @xcite and three events in the region @xmath52 gev/@xmath12 ( pnn2 )  @xcite . combining the results with the observation of two events in pnn1 and one event in pnn2 by the predecessor experiment e787 gave @xmath53 ( fig .",

    "the koto collaboration built the neutral beam line at the hadron hall of j - parc and surveyed the beam in 2009 .",

    "koto , as the first step in measuring @xmath54 at j - parc , aims at the observation of @xmath36 , and the goal of na62 is to detect 100 @xmath45 events . at fnal ,",
    "a new proposal  @xcite to measure @xmath45 decays at rest has been submitted .",
    "higher sensitivity kaon experiments based on a new high - intensity proton source at fnal  @xcite are now under discussion .    at j - parc ,",
    "another new kaon experiment ( e06 trek )  @xcite is being prepared . in the @xmath55 decay , the transverse muon polarization ( @xmath56 )",
    "is a t - odd quantity and is a cp violation observable .",
    "new sources of cp violation may give rise to @xmath56 as large as @xmath57 .",
    "trek is a successor to e246 at kek - ps  @xcite and will measure the charged track and photons from the @xmath19 decay at rest with the e246 superconducting toroidal magnet , and aims at a @xmath56 sensitivity of @xmath58 .",
    "a low - momentum beam line is being built at the hadron hall .",
    "experimental searches for very light bosons have a long history , but a neutral boson whose mass is twice the muon mass has not yet been excluded . in 2005 ,",
    "the hypercp collaboration at fnal reported three events of the @xmath59 decay , and the dimuon mass may indicate a neutral intermediate state @xmath60 with a mass of @xmath61 mev/@xmath62  @xcite .",
    "since the events were observed in an fcnc with a strange to down quark transition , @xmath60 should be confirmable with kaon decays .",
    "dimuon masses in previous @xmath63 measurements were not observed in the narrow range around the @xmath60 mass ; thus , @xmath60 should be a pseudo - scalar or axial - vector particle and be studied with the three - body decay @xmath64 .",
