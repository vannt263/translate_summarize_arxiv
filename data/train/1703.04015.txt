    "chimera states simultaneously featuring stable groups of synchronized and incoherent oscillators in coupled , spatially - extended systems have attracted enormous attention ever since they were first seen more than a decade ago  @xcite .",
    "this is likely due to the counter - intuitive symmetry breaking that such spatio - temporal patterns display .",
    "kuramoto and battogtokh first discovered the possibility of such symmetry - broken states within a network of identical phase oscillators in numerical simulations of the complex ginzburg - landau equation with non - local coupling  @xcite .",
    "soon thereafter , strogatz and abrams performed a rigorous analysis and also coined the term `` chimera '' for this novel state  @xcite .    in the years since this analysis",
    ", a diverse array of studies focusing on the numerical computation of chimeras revealed the wide applicability and robustness of such a feature ( even against small spatial inhomogeneities ) across many coupled - oscillator systems .",
    "furthermore , distinct dynamical variants to kuramoto s original chimeras were discovered ( transient vs. permanent , traveling vs. standing , etc . )",
    "a classification of the different known chimera - like states can be found in the recent contribution of ref .",
    "@xcite ; see also references therein , as well as in ref .",
    "@xcite , for a broad range of relevant examples .    on the experimental side ,",
    "the number of available paradigms is far more limited .",
    "nevertheless , recently chimera states have begun to be reported in mechanical @xcite , chemical @xcite , electro - chemical @xcite , and opto - electronic @xcite oscillator systems .",
    "an optical study also found chimera dynamics within liquid - crystal cells @xcite where the coupling was accomplished via computer feedback .",
    "similar patterns were also seen in an electronic fm oscillator with time - delayed feedback @xcite . in the mechanical case ,",
    "a group of identical metronomes on elastically coupled swings revealed the possibility for a chimera state consisting of one synchronized group and another turbulent one  @xcite .",
    "the observation of near - harmonic chemical oscillations in the oxide - layer thickness of electro - oxidized silicon @xcite found two - dimensional quasi - chimera states in which coherent and turbulent domains alternated in their location @xcite .",
    "a lattice of electronic oscillators mimicking neuron - like spiking was found to be divided into quiescent and synchronized domains in  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we report direct experimental observations of chimera - like states in a one - dimensional lattice of phase oscillators .",
    "we also develop from first principles a corresponding theoretical model and perform numerical simulations of the equations approximately describing the experimental system and discuss the results .",
    "the lattice consists of 32 wien - bridge oscillators , each one bi - directionally and resistively coupled to its two nearest neighbors in a ring formation .",
    "this system has been the subject of recent synchronization studies @xcite and shown to obey the kuramoto - sakaguchi phase oscillator model @xcite to a good approximation .",
    "crucially , its dynamics can be fully captured ( in a distributed , spatio - temporal way ) and characterized experimentally .",
    "while our numerical observations do not reveal turbulent or chaotic states , we dub the observed features chimera - like states in the following generalized sense : our system supports a _ traveling _ domain of nearly phase - locked oscillators inside of a _ standing _ nearly out - of - phase background .",
    "experimentally , we also see hints of these traveling chimera states ( at the high end of the explored parameter window discussed below ) , but in addition ( for slightly lower parameter values ) we also see stationary patterns of coexisting domains .",
    "these also include the possibility of one of the co - existing states being apparently chaotic . in the simulations , such stationary domains",
    "could only be achieved by the introduction of impurities .",
    "more broadly , both experimental and numerical results suggest that the existence of these chimera - like states relies on the presence of bi - directional coupling , as well as on the sakaguchi - kuramoto phase - delay parameter , @xmath0 , set to a value within a fairly narrow window .",
    "our presentation will be structured as follows .",
    "we will start by describing the experimental setup and design ( section ii ) .",
    "we will then present an approximate theoretical model emulating the relevant electronic system ( section iii ) . in section iv",
    ", we will give a series of simulations for guidance on the kind of phenomenology that the model may exhibit .",
    "finally , in section v we will present our experimental results , and in section vi we will summarize our findings and present some conclusions and future challenges .",

    "we couple 32 individual wien - bridge oscillators in a ring topology .",
    "the oscillators have a natural frequency centered around 279.5 hz with a standard deviation of 0.35 hz .",
    "this means that the spread in natural frequency is only about 0.13 percent and hence for practical purposes the oscillators are nearly identical in this measure .",
    "the coupling between nearest neighbors in the ring is accomplished resistively , and it can be either uni - directional or bi - directional in nature ; shown in the figure is the latter configuration with two oscillators fleshed out in the top panel .",
    "all oscillators are monitored simultaneously by a 32-channel digitizer . in previous studies",
    "@xcite , only one resistor from the op - amp output of the first oscillator to the non - inverting input of the second ( labeled @xmath1 ) was used to establish the ( uni - directional ) connection .",
    "the resulting oscillator phase interaction was found to be well described by a kuramoto - sakaguchi model with a fairly low value of the phase - delay parameter , @xmath0 .",

    "two wien - bridge oscillators were first tuned to the same natural frequency ( to within achievable precision ) before adding two resistors , @xmath2 and @xmath1 , that couple them uni - directionally .",

    "it is also desirable to possess some experimental control of @xmath0 .",
    "several modifications to the purely resistive coupling were tested for this purpose , such as incorporating coupling capacitors . however , simply adding the coupling resistor , @xmath2 , proved to be the most efficient way to tune @xmath0 over a large interval .",

    "we once again caution the reader that the experimental system is only _ approximately _ described by the model , and hence the observed deviations from the simulation results may be attributed to model limitations .",
    "the main difference is ( a ) that we operate the experimental wien - bridge oscillators at a higher gain value of @xmath68 , and ( b ) that the diode - pair is in fact lowering the effective resistance of @xmath16 and not increasing the resistance of @xmath17 , and ( c ) that higher order terms would be needed in eq .",

    "nonetheless , the model is phenomenologically consistent with the gain saturation for larger voltages caused by the diodes and already features a number of intriguing phenomenological features motivating the presented experiments .",
    "having stated these caveats , let us turn to the experimental picture .",
    "we start the investigation with near - identical oscillators coupled in the _ uni - directional _ ring topology . here , the oscillators synchronize themselves into a perfectly phase - locked mode that obeys the periodic boundary condition of @xmath69 .",

    "the coupling resistors , @xmath61 and @xmath72 , are both at 62 k@xmath4 .",
    "such forward - facing rolls of synchronization are very stable states for this coupling configuration .",
    "since each oscillator is effectively driven by the previous one without acting back on it , such patterns are naturally expected .        when additional coupling resistors of the same value ( 62 k@xmath4 ) are added to make the ring bi - directional , however ,",
    "the dynamics changes significantly .",
    "in this situation , due to the underlying symmetry one might expect a state of perfect synchrony , corresponding to a mode number of @xmath73 , but this is not what is observed .",
    "figure [ result1 ] depicts a typical data - set . a phase - locked cluster of oscillators",
    "can clearly be discerned .",
    "this cluster extends roughly between oscillator 5 and 28",
    ". outside of this cluster , no stable phase pattern is evident .",
    "the spatial location of the synchronized cluster is likely determined by small impurities in the ring lattice ( both on - site and in the coupling ) .",
    "we have made sure that the uncoupled frequencies of all 32 oscillators are within a very narrow band ; the distribution mean and standard deviation are given by 279.5 hz and 0.35 hz , respectively .",

    "we see that the periodic interaction with the cluster causes regularly - spaced frequency pulling.,width=316 ]    in order to investigate the chimera - like pattern in this system more closely , let us first extract the phase information of the individual oscillators from their raw voltage data .",
    "this was accomplished using the well - known hilbert transform ( described , for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . note that the phases obtained in this fashion do not advance at exactly constant speeds over a single period , as the voltage oscillations deviate substantially from sinusoids .",
    "nonetheless , inspection of the phase - profiles indicates no abrupt or large - scale fluctuations in phase - velocity within a single period of oscillation , thus providing us with a useful measure of oscillator phase .",
    "figure [ result2](a ) shows the phase of each oscillator at five equally - spaced instants of time .",
    "it is evident that the oscillators within the synchronized cluster from x=5 to x=28 maintain a fixed phase relationship with one another , whereas the background oscillators assume fairly random phases at these times .",
    "furthermore , the synchronized cluster is characterized by a non - zero phase advance of roughly @xmath76 1.2 rad . while fig .",
    "[ result2](a ) does not show it , close inspection of fig .",
    "[ result1 ] suggests that there may be , however , a discernible pattern in the decoherent part .",
    "there we can see a cluster of nearly in - phase oscillators traveling in what appears to be a domain of out - of - phase oscillators .",
    "the overall effect is that the instantaneous phases will appear scattered over all angles , but the underlying reason may be the periodic emergence of `` bursts '' of traveling in - phase clusters .",
    "let us now turn to the dynamic oscillator frequencies .",
    "a straightforward way of computing these frequencies uses the interpolated ( upward ) zero - crossings in the voltage time - series ( as described in more detail in ref .",

    "figure [ 50_ohm ] ( a ) shows not the raw phase data , but instead the numerical spatial derivative , as approximated by a centered difference , which accentuate the traveling patterns visually . in fact ,",
    "the solid ( green ) areas here represent the regions of anti - synchronized behavior , whereas the traveling synchronized cluster can be seen quite clearly .",
    "interestingly , a synchronized nearly stationary region can also be detected in the vicinity of oscillators @xmath83@xmath84 , which may be triggered by an impurity .",
