    "in field theory , the decomposition of the state vector in the basis of free fields with given momenta results in the concept of relativistic wave function in momentum space .",
    "the latter is the coefficient of the decomposition  the fock component .",
    "the state vector is described by an infinite set of the fock components , corresponding to different numbers of particles .",
    "however , the models used in applications usually consider only few - body fock components .",
    "the infinite set of the fock components is truncated to one component only , with two or three quarks .",
    "the belief that a given fock sector dominates is mainly based on intuitive expectations and `` experimental evidences '' rather than on field - theoretical analysis . without this analysis a model remains to be phenomenological . though one can perturbatively estimate the next fock components ( with one or even few extra particles ) , this says nothing about convergence of full fock decomposition .",
    "the difficulty to take into account the many - body sectors is caused by the fact that it is equivalent to solving a true field - theory problem .",
    "important part of this problem  finding the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) function @xcite  is solved in the wick - cutkosky model @xcite . in this case",
    "the bs equation is reduced to the one - dimensional one which can be easily solved numerically for arbitrary coupling constant . in weak and strong coupling limits",
    "there are explicit analytical solutions .",
    "this allows us to use wick - cutkosky model for non - perturbative study the fock decomposition .    in the wick - cutkosky model two spinless constituents with mass @xmath4 interact by exchange by a massless scalar particle .",
    "corresponding bs function is the `` two - body '' one in the sense that it depends on two four - dimensional particle coordinates .",
    "the term `` two - body '' here is rather slang than reflection of a real physical situation .",
    "it may be misleading .",
    "we emphasize that this _ does not _",
    "mean that the `` two - body '' bs function describes a two - body system , i.e. , a system with the state vector truncated to the two - body fock component . on the contrary",
    ", the corresponding state vector contains infinite set of the fock components with two massive constituents and @xmath5 massless exchanged particles .",
    "this can be explained as follows . in terms of the feynman diagrams ,",
    "the one - boson exchange kernel generates the ladder graphs only .",
    "one of these graphs , with two exchanges , is shown in fig .",
    "[ feyn2 ] .",
    "we will work in the light - front dynamics ( lfd ) . in terms of the time - ordered graphs , in the light - front ( lf ) time , this feynman diagram contributes to the two- , three- and four - body states ( with two massive constituents and with zero , one and two exchanged bosons ) .",
    "there are six such time - ordered graphs .",
    "one of these graphs is shown in fig .",
    "since the bs equation deals with infinite series of ladder exchanges , it implicitly incorporates all the intermediate states with number of particles from two to infinity .",
    "the problem ( solved in the present paper ) is to `` extract '' from the bs solution the two - body contribution and total contribution of all other fock components .",
    "comparison of total contribution with the two - body one shows the contribution of the many - body sectors .    because of the ladder kernel , the wick - cutkosky model is still approximate .",
    "all the exchange particles , emitted by one and the same boson , must be and absorbed by other one .",
    "the graphs with particles emitted by different bosons in the same intermediate state are generated by the cross feynman box which is absent in the wick - cutkosky model .",
    "self - energy graphs are absent too . in spite of these restrictions , the wick - cutkosky solution does contain in the state vector an infinite sum of many - body fock components .",
    "namely this property is most important for our work .    in wick - cutkosky model",
    "there are also some abnormal solutions which have no counterpart in the non - relativistic potential theory @xcite .",
    "there was a discussion @xcite , whether they are physical ones or not .",
    "this is a separate problem , not related to our study .",
    "we deal with the normal solution . in non - relativistic limit",
    "the two - body fock component , which only survives in the state vector of normal solution , turns into the usual ground state wave function in the coulomb potential .",
    "a truncated lf field theory was developed in @xcite .",
    "some estimations of the higher fock sectors were done in @xcite .",
    "truncated lf fock space decomposition was applied in @xcite to nonperturbative study the large @xmath1 qed .",
    "recently , the fock decomposition , incorporating first three fock sectors , was used for nonperturbative renormalization in a scalar model @xcite and , with two sectors ,  in yukawa model @xcite and in gauge theory @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we study in the wick - cutkosky model the contribution of the many - body sectors in electromagnetic form factor and compare it with the two - body contribution .",
    "besides , we calculate the contribution to the normalization integral of the two- and three - body states . subtracting them from 1 , we get contribution of all the states with @xmath6 . in this way",
    "we investigate the convergence of the fock decomposition .",
