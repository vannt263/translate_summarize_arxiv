    "the behavior of three - boson systems changes remarkably from two ( 2d ) to three dimensions ( 3d ) .",
    "the most famous example is the efimov effect , which was predicted and measured for three identical bosons in 3d systems , but is absent in 2d .",
    "while in 3d the efimov effect produces an infinite ladder of geometrically spaced states when the scattering length diverges , previous studies have shown that the spectrum of three identical bosons in 2d contains exactly one two - body and two three - body bound states in the limit where the range of the interaction goes to zero @xcite .    starting from the well - known case of three identical bosons , systematic calculation of universal properties of mass - imbalanced three - body systems in 2d are performed using zero - range interactions in momentum space .",
    "when at least one pairwise interaction is different from the other two , the dependence of the three - body energy on the two - body energy is quite different for ground and excited sates .",
    "for instance , whereas there is always a bound ground state for any three - body system in 2d ( assuming at least two pairs are bound ) , the first excited state only occurs for special choices of masses and two - body binding energies .",
    "nevertheless , three - body ground and excited state energies are parametrized as _ supercircles _",
    "@xcite , where the scaled two - body energies are the `` coordinates '' and the radius and the power represents a weak mass - dependence @xcite .",
    "we investigate @xmath0 bound systems whose dynamics is restricted to two spatial dimensions ( 2d ) .",
    "the masses are @xmath1 and the pairwise interactions are described for attractive zero - range potentials .",
    "the three - body wave function @xmath2 for any @xmath3wave bound state of energy @xmath4 is a solution of the free schredinger equation , except where particles overlap . using the faddeev decomposition in momentum space , the bound state wave function is written as ( we introduce here @xmath5 as cyclic permutations of @xmath6 ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the @xmath9 particle momenta with respect to center - of - mass of the subsystem @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the pair relative momenta , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the reduced masses and @xmath14 are the faddeev components , or spectator functions .",
    "the three - body energy , @xmath4 , is the solution of a set of three coupled homogeneous integral equations .",
    "this set of equations involves the three spectator functions and is written , in a compact form , as @xmath15 where @xmath16 are the matrix elements of the two - body t - matrix .",
    "the logarithmic term comes from the low - energy expansion of the scattering amplitude in 2d , as it was showed for equal mass particles in @xcite .",
    "besides , the logarithm leads to an ambiguity in the definition of the scattering length in 2d , which depends on the scale used to measure the energy .",
    "we use the binding energy of the pairs , @xmath17 , as the physical scales in the problem .",
    "notice that three - body bound states are only allowed when at least two pairs are bound . for each non - interacting pair ,",
    "the respective spectator function is zero . whenever more than one pair is not interacting",
    ", the set of equations does not exist .",
    "this can be seen by setting @xmath18 in eq .",
    ", for the non - interacting @xmath10 pair . in 2d ,",
    "the effect of a non - interacting pair in eq .",
    "is the same as setting this pair with null interaction energy in eq .  .",
    "in the most general scenario of three distinguishable @xmath0 particles , the three - body binding energy ( @xmath4 ) is a function of six independent parameters , namely masses and two - body binding energies .",
    "realistic scenarios correspond to given particles with known masses , where pairwise interactions are tunable through feshbach resonances .",
    "common elements in cold atomic experiments are the alkali atoms .",
    "the particles are assumed to be @xmath19rb , @xmath20k , and @xmath21li .",
    "moreover , the large mass - asymmetry between @xmath22li and @xmath23rb allow the three - body system to have more bound states than a system composed of particles with comparable masses @xcite .",
    "once particles are chosen the number of independent parameters drops to three and defining the @xmath24-binding energy ( @xmath25 ) as unit , the scaled three - body energy ( @xmath26 ) is a function of only two independent parameters , namely , the scaled @xmath27-energies .",
    "in other words , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 labels ground state and @xmath30 excited states . full numerical calculation of @xmath31 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] in the parametric space of the two - body scaled energies @xmath32 and @xmath33 for the chosen particles .",
    "values as function of the two - body energies @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the solid and dashed curves are for ground and excited states , respectively . here",
    "@xmath36 is @xmath23rb , @xmath37 is @xmath38k , and @xmath39 is @xmath22li .",
    "the dotted curves are boundaries between regions where i , ii , or iii bound states are allowed . ]    although the equations which define the three - body energy as function of masses and two - body energies are very complicated , they can be expressed in a simple way , through the _ supercircles _ parametrization @xmath40 where the radius ( @xmath41 ) and the exponent ( @xmath42 ) are given by : @xmath43 where @xmath44 exhibits a weak dependence on mass and @xmath45 are almost mass independent and a similar expression can be calculated to @xmath46 .",
    "notice that the lines describing @xmath31 in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , which are the result of an extensive numerical work , are almost perfectly described by the parametrization in eq .",
    "this result can be used for fast estimation of three - body energies and the number of bound states in specific systems for different sets of two - body energies .    as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , the result presented in eq .",
    "is quite general .",
    "it holds for any choice of two - body energies , including the case where one of them is equal zero . in this case , the properties of the system change @xcite , but the parametrization is still valid . as it was discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec:1 ] , if more than one pair is noninteracting , there is no three - body bound state .",
    "this work was partly supported by funds provided by fapesp ( fundao de amparo  pesquisa do estado de so paulo ) and cnpq ( conselho nacional de desenvolvimento cientfico e tecnolgico ) of brazil , and by the danish agency for science , technology , and innovation ."
