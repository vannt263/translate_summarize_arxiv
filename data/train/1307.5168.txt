    "the beginning of the last century saw the development of new synthetic materials such as polymers and paint that display seemingly odd flow behaviours .",
    "the realisation that their responses to external stresses can not be described by hooke s law of elasticity @xcite or newton s law of viscosity @xcite led eugene bingham to coin the term rheology ( derived from the greek verb @xmath0 meaning to flow ) for the study of their flow and deformation @xcite .",
    "shaving foams , shampoo , blood , ink , ketchup and soap solutions are some everyday examples of non - hookean and non - newtonian materials @xcite",
    ". the building blocks of these materials are supramolecular aggregates .",
    "the forces that exist between these aggregates ( typically , screened coulomb repulsions , hydrogen bonds and van der waals attractions ) can be overcome by small or moderate stresses .",
    "they are therefore called soft materials . besides having a wide range of applications , soft materials such as liquid crystals ,",
    "aqueous colloidal suspensions , polymer solutions and granular materials are also important for fundamental research @xcite .",
    "french physicist pierre - gilles de gennes , often described as the founding father of soft matter physics , began his nobel lecture with the following sentences @xcite : _ ` what do we mean by soft matter ?",
    "americans prefer to call it `` complex fluids '' .",
    "this is a rather ugly name which tends to discourage the young students .",
    "but it does indeed bring in two of the major features'_. de gennes went on to list _ complexity _ and _ flexibility _ as these two major features .",
    "the _ complexity _ of soft matter arises from the elaborate organisation of the supramolecular building blocks .",
    "de gennes illustrated the _ flexibility _ of soft matter by citing the example of the boots that amerindians of the amazon basin made to protect their feet @xcite .",
    "they extracted latex ( a viscous solution of unentangled , long - chain polymers ) from hevea trees , which they applied to their feet .",
    "the latex solidified quickly into something resembling a boot .",
    "this liquid - solid transition is brought about by the oxygen in the atmosphere that reacts with latex to form bridges between the polymeric chains at specific points .",
    "while unconnected polymer chains exhibit viscous flow , the polymer network that is formed when latex reacts with oxygen is elastic .",
    "there is , however , more to the story of the boots .",
    "these boots are rather short - lived as the oxygen , which initially bound the polymer chains , eventually ends up severing those very bonds that it helped make . in 1839",
    ", charles goodyear @xcite showed that if latex is boiled with suphur ( in a process called vulcanisation ) , the rubber that is formed is extremely strong and resilient @xcite .",
    "the amerindians boots and the vulcanised rubber both reveal the enormous flexibility of latex and are excellent examples of how a small chemical reaction is sufficient to completely alter its flow behaviour .",
    "this article focusses on the flexibility of soft matter .",
    "its aim is to introduce the reader to the intriguing dynamics of soft matter that are triggered , not by chemical reactions , but by the application of small or moderate stresses and strains .",
    "the behaviour of solids subjected to external forces is described by hooke s law : @xmath1 = g@xmath2 @xcite . here , @xmath1 is the stress , or the force per unit area , and @xmath3 is the shear strain , or the relative change in length .",
    "g is the elastic modulus and is an intrinsic property of the deformed material .",
    "most metals and ceramics show hookean behaviour when subjected to low strains @xcite .",
    "liquids such as water and some oils , on the other hand , are described by newton s law of viscosity : @xmath1 = @xmath4 @xcite ( fig.[fig : rheo](a ) ) . here",
    ", @xmath5 is the rate at which the applied strain changes .",
    "the proportionality constant @xmath6 , another material constant , is the viscosity of the liquid and measures its lack of slipperiness or its resistance to flow when an external shear stress is imposed .",
    "soft materials are neither perfectly elastic nor perfectly viscous .",
    "instead , they exhibit both elastic and viscous responses and are called ` viscoelastic materials ' or ` non - newtonian fluids ' .",
    "their flow is very sensitive to their structural organisation , with their microstructures being easily altered by external stresses . when a hookean solid is deformed , the extension is instantaneous . in contrast ,",
    "the stress generated by a deformed viscoelastic material is a nonlinear function of the history of the deformation gradient .",
    "viscoelastic materials are therefore also referred to as memory fluids . if a rotating shaft that is stirring a polymeric liquid is suddenly released , the shaft will return halfway . however , if the shaft is held stationary for some time before its release , the extent of reformation is considerably smaller because of the fading memory of the polymeric liquid .",
    "clearly , hooke s law and newton s law of viscosity are inadequate to describe this experiment . for a video of this experiment and also of several other demonstrations of the intriguing flow properties of soft materials ,",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "the stress tensor @xcite provides a complete description of the stresses within a three dimensional object .",
    "the scalar component @xmath7 of the stress tensor , representing the component of the stress in the @xmath8 direction on a surface whose normal is in the @xmath9 direction , is written as @xmath10    a newtonian liquid at rest supports only a uniform normal stress , its hydrostatic pressure @xmath11 ( @xmath12 = @xmath13 = @xmath14 = -@xmath11 ) .",
    "when this liquid is sheared , the newtonian constitutive relation @xcite gives @xmath15 = @xmath16 = @xmath17 .",
    "in viscoelastic materials , @xmath18 and the first and second normal stress differences ( n@xmath19 = @xmath12 - @xmath13 and n@xmath20 = @xmath13 - @xmath14 ) are non - zero . for large deformations , the shear stress @xmath15 is a function of the deformation field .",
    "these features give rise to novel and counter - intuitive flow phenomena and will be discussed in the subsequent sections .",
    "( b ) the viscosity of a 35 wt.% aqueous cornstarch suspension changes dramatically with changes in shear rate @xcite . as shear rate",
    "is increased , the suspension viscosity first decreases ( shear - thinning ) and then increases ( shear - thickening ) .",
    "finally , shear - banding takes over and the suspension breaks up into coexisiting bands of high and low viscosities .",

    "wilhelm weber noticed in 1835 that loading a silk thread resulted in an initial instantaneous extension that was followed by a more gradual increase in the length of the thread . when the load was removed , the thread eventually contracted to its original length @xcite .",
    "such a time - dependent response is a typical feature of viscoelastic materials and can be described by a time - dependent modulus g(t ) = @xmath15(t)@xmath23 @xcite .",
    "this relation holds in the limit of small strains , which is called the linear viscoelastic regime ( lve ) . for large applied strains",
    ", the shear modulus also depends on the strain .",

    "this figure is reproduced with permission @xcite . ]",
    "linear viscoelastic flow can be modelled by linear combinations of springs ( perfectly elastic elements ) and dashpots ( perfectly dissipative elements ) .",
    "the simplest models are the kelvin - voigt @xcite and the maxwell @xcite models and comprise one spring and one dashpot , in parallel and series , respectively .",
    "examples of non - newtonian flow are displayed in figs .",
    "1(b ) and 1(c ) respectively @xcite .",
    "if the viscosity of a material increases with the rate of deformation , it is a dilatant or a shear - thickening material @xcite .",
    "the viscosity of a wide range of viscoelastic materials can be modelled by the relation @xmath28 , where @xmath5 is the applied shear rate , and @xmath29 , @xmath30 are material constants @xcite .",
    "these materials , called ` power - law fluids ' , are usually shear - thinning ( with @xmath31 1 , as in polymer melts ) . in contrast , some materials , such as concentrated suspensions , show regimes of shear - thickening ( with @xmath32 1 ) .",
    "a good example of a material that can exhibit both shear - thinning and shear - thickening is a concentrated aqueous suspension of cornstarch ( a fine , powdery starch , extracted from maize or corn ) which ` jams ' when it is stirred vigorously , but flows when stirred gently ( @xcite , fig.[fig : rheo](b ) ) .",
    "the jamming phenomenon is triggered by the shear - driven crowding of the macromolecules , which imposes kinetic constraints on the macromolecular dynamics , thereby increasing the viscosity of the suspension @xcite .",
    "when a projectile impacts a cornstarch suspension , large , positive normal stresses develop , and shear - thickening alone can not explain the observed solidification .",
    "a recent work shows that when concentrated suspensions of cornastarch are compressed , dynamic jamming fronts that can absorb a large amount of momentum develop , which results in the growth of solid - like columns in the suspension @xcite .",
    "strain - induced slowdown of the dynamics of jammed aqueous foams and aging clay suspensions have been reported in @xcite .",
    "dynamical slowing down leads to shear - thickening in both these materials can be attributed to jamming , which results in the confinement of the foam bubbles and the electrostatically charged clay platelets .",
    "a commonly cited example of dilatancy is the ` wet sand effect ' .",
    "when a person walks on compacted wet sand on a beach , the sand swells ( dilates ) around his or her feet @xcite .",
    "the water trickles down through the pores , leaving dry sand above .",
    "silly putty@xmath27 is an easily available shear - thickening material @xcite .",
    "it is marketed widely as a toy and is composed of silicone polymers such as polydimethylsiloxane . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sillyputty ] , silly putty@xmath27 can bounce like an elastic solid at short times , but can spread or flow like a viscous liquid at long times .",
    "when pulled slowly , it behaves like a liquid and stretches without breaking . for sudden pulls ,",
    "it snaps like a solid .",
    "a useful dimensionless number to introduce here is the deborah number @xmath26 = @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the characteristic relaxation time of the material and @xmath35 is the time scale of the externally imposed flow .",
    "when @xmath26 is large ( @xmath36 @xmath34 ) , silly putty@xmath27 retains memory of its size and shape and behaves like an elastic solid . if @xmath26 is small ( @xmath37 ) , it flows like a liquid due to its fading memory . while the viscosity of a shear - thickening material increases with an increase in the rate of shear , the viscosity of a rheopectic materials , such as printers ink or gypsum , increases with time due to the application of a constant shear stress .      in 1923 , f. schalek and a. szegvai showed that aqueous iron oxide gels , when shaken , liquefied to exhibit sol - like properties @xcite .",
    "the sample solidified again when the shaking was stopped .",
    "the term thixotropy , derived from the greek words ` thixis ' ( to touch ) and ` trepo ' ( to change ) , describes the reversible behaviour of materials that are solid - like under normal circumstance , but that flow when sheared or stirred .",
    "their viscosities depend on the time duration , and not the rate , of the applied shear .",
    "thixotropic materials do not attain steady - state flow instaneously when a constant shear stress is applied .",
    "they also typically require some time to return to a steady state after the cessation of shear .",
    "an excellent review on this aspect of non - newtonian flow can be found in @xcite .",
    "paints and adhesives are two common materials that exhibit thixotropic flow .",
    "shear - thinning or pseudoplasticity refers to the decrease in a material s viscosity with increasing rate of shear ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rheo](b ) , fig .",
    "[ fig : thixo ] , @xcite ) .",
    "all thixotropic materials are therefore shear - thinning , although the converse is not necessarily true .",
    "when a highly viscous solution of entangled polymers flows in a pipe , shear forces disentangle the polymer chains .",
    "if the shear forces are high enough , the polymer chains eventually align along the flow direction .",
    "this results in a sharp drop in the viscosity of the sample @xcite .",
    "melts of the polymer acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ( abs ) show power - law shear thinning @xcite . for low @xmath5 , the viscosity has a constant magnitude @xmath38 ( the zero shear viscosity ) . for intermediate @xmath5 , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are constants .",
    "at higher @xmath5 , newtonian behaviour is sometimes recovered .",
    "aqueous foam , which is constituted by closely - packed polydisperse gas bubbles dispersed in a small volume of surfactant solution , can exhibit shear - thinning .",
    "shaving foam , when sprayed on a surface , retains its shape and behaves like a solid , but can flow by the stick - slip motion of the bubbles when gently tapped with a finger @xcite .",
    "similarly , marmalade on a piece of toast retains its shape when left unperturbed , but flows easily under the shearing action of a knife .",
    "suspensions , which are mixtures of two substances , one of which is finely divided and dispersed in the other ( for example , colloidal particles in water ) , and emulsions which are tiny droplets of one material suspended in another immiscible material ( for example , milk , mayonnaise and paint ) exhibit power - law shear - thinning due to flow - induced microstructural rearrangements @xcite .",
    "an interesting consequence of shear - thinning is the kaye effect @xcite .",
    "when a stream of shampoo hits a surface , a heap is created at the point of impact .",
    "the shampoo shear - thins as it flows down the heap under gravity .",
    "as more shampoo falls on this shear - thinned layer , it slips and occasionally flies off a dimple in the underlying heap .",
    "this results in secondary lasso - shaped jets of shampoo that hit the primary stream of shampoo before finally collapsing .",
    "this is called the kaye effect and usually lasts less than a few hundred milliseconds @xcite .",
    "a material exhibits plastic behaviour if it does not flow when a stress lying below a certain threshold ( called the yield stress ) is applied .",
    "if it flows like a newtonian liquid when the yield stress is exceeded , it is called a bingham plastic @xcite .",
    "such a flow can be described as follows : @xmath5 = 0 for @xmath42 , and @xmath43 for @xmath44 ( fig.[fig : rheo](c ) ) . here , @xmath45 , the yield stress @xcite , is a measure of the stress required to break the structure of the sample .",
    "toothpaste , mayonnaise , tomato ketchup and aqueous foam are examples of materials with non - zero yield stresses .",
    "toothpaste , for instance , can not flow out of its tube spontaneously , but oozes out when the tube is squeezed hard enough that the yield stress is exceeded .",
    "similarly , tomato ketchup has a non - zero yield stress and flows out of the bottle only after vigorous tapping . when subjected to stresses",
    "that exceed the yielding value , emulsions flow due to the cooperative motion of the rearranging droplets @xcite .",
    "the extent of the spatial cooperativity can be described in terms of a correlation length that diverges close to the yielding threshold .",
    "the solid - liquid transition in normal emulsions is continuous , and the static ( solid - liquid ) and the dynamic ( liquid - solid ) yield stresses are identical . when thixotropic emulsions ( composed of clay platelets forming links between the emulsion droplets ) are sheared , the transition from rest ( solid ) to flow ( liquid ) is discontinuous",
    ". localised shear zones ( shear bands ) exist in the no - flow regime and flow occurs only above a sample history - dependent shear rate @xmath46 @xcite . for normal emulsions , @xmath47 0 .",
    "the viscosity of an ideal yield stress fluid is expected to diverge continuously as the yield stress is approached .",
    "the viscosity of a real yield stress fluid such as a clay suspension , in contrast , diverges abruptly at the yield point @xcite .",
    "the second observation is explained in terms of a bifurcation in the rheology of the clay suspension .",
    "for very low stresses , the clay sample ages , its viscosity increases with time and the flow soon stops . for large applied stresses , the sample shear - thins ( in a phenomenon called ` rejuvenation ' ) and the sample flows like a liquid . very close to the yielding threshold",
    ", the flow is characterised by the presence of avalanches .",
    "the non - linearities inherent in the stress - deformation relation of sheared viscoelastic materials gives rise to non - zero normal stress differences .",
    "when a viscoelastic material is subjected to moderately large values of @xmath5 , the first and second normal stress differences are given by @xmath48 = @xmath12 - @xmath13 = -@xmath49 and @xmath50 = @xmath13 - @xmath14 = -@xmath51 . here ,",
    "@xmath52 and @xmath53 , the first and second normal stress coefficients , are positive and negative , respectively @xcite .",
    "the viscosities of melts of abs and ps ( polystyrene ) decrease with increasing rate of shear deformation , but increase in elongational flow @xcite .",
    "this , phenomenon , called extensional thickening , arises due to the non - zero value of @xmath48 .",
    "the corresponding time - dependent uniaxial extensional viscosity , @xmath54 = @xmath55/\\dot\\gamma$ ] , can not be inferred from the shear viscosity @xmath6 .",
    "a small change in the composition of polymer solutions can cause an appreciable change in @xmath56 and almost no change in @xmath6 @xcite . in the low @xmath5 regime , however , the prediction of trouton s law ( @xmath56 = 3@xmath38 ) works quite well @xcite .",
    "due to their shear rate - dependent viscosities , the existence of yield stresses and non - zero normal stresses , soft materials exhibit novel , nonintuitive dynamics , a select few of which will be highlighted in this section .",
    "if a rotating disk is placed on the surface of a beaker filled with a newtonian liquid , the liquid is pushed outward towards the walls of the beaker .",
    "it then descends along the walls and eventually rises at the centre . when a similar experiment is repeated with a beaker containing a polymer solution , the currents are in the opposite directions . in another experiment ,",
    "a disk rotating at the bottom of a beaker filled with a newtonian liquid causes a depression in the liquid level at the surface .",
    "a disk rotating at the bottom of a beaker filled with a polymeric solution , in contrast , causes the solution surface to rise at the centre @xcite .",
    "these observations arise due to the positive value of the first normal stress coefficient @xmath52 .",
    "it is well - known that the surface of a newtonian liquid flowing down a tilted trough of semi - circular cross section is flat , apart from some curvature due to meniscus effects .",
    "a non - newtonian liquid flowing down the same trough , however , has a convex surface .",
    "this is a consequence of the negative value of its second normal stress coefficient @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this subsection discusses three examples of the unusual flow of polymer solutions .",
    "the reader is refered to @xcite for detailed discussions of these and related phenomena .",
    "a.   _ weissenberg effect : _ when a newtonian liquid is stirred with a rod , the inertial forces that are generated throw the liquid outward .",
    "this causes a depression in the liquid level near the rod and an elevation at the walls .",
    "in contrast , when a polymer solution is stirred , it climbs the rotating rod .",
    "this phenomenon , also referrred to as the rod - climbing effect @xcite , is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pol](a ) . when the viscoelastic polymer solution is stirred , a tension develops along the circular lines of flow .",
    "this results in a pressure that is directed towards the centre of the beaker .",
    "a finite , positive @xmath48 develops , which drives the polymer solution up the rotating rod .",
    "b.   _ barus effect : _ when a polymer solution is extruded through an orifice , it swells ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pol](b ) ) . the swelling can be upto three or four times of the orifice diameter .",
    "this phenomenon is also referred to as the merrington effect , die swell or extrudate swell .",
    "as the sample is squeezed out through the orifice , the stretching of the polymer chains results in a non - zero value of @xmath48 . immediately after leaving the orifice , the polymer chains relax back to their original globular structures .",
    "this gives rise to the observed swelling .",
    "as @xmath48 increases with shear rate @xmath5 , extrudate swelling increases with increasing rate of extrusion @xcite .",
    "this example demonstrates that the polymer chains retain memory of their deformation history during the extrusion process .",
    "delayed die swell of elongated macromolecules has been reported in wormlike micellar solutions @xcite . c.   _ fano flow : _ this is a common example of extensional thickening @xcite . if a nozzle dipped into a bath containing a newtonian liquid is raised above the liquid surface , the liquid column breaks immediately . to siphon out a newtonian liquid",
    ", the nozzle must be dipped below the surface .",
    "non - newtonian fluids , in contrast , can be pulled up to a considerable height above the fluid surface without rupturing the fluid column @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon , also referred to as a ` ductless ' or a ` tubeless ' siphon , is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pol](c ) .",
    "when a highly viscoelastic material is sucked out , large normal stresses that balance the weight of the fluid column develop .",
    "this results in fano flow @xcite .      in 1948 , b. toms noticed that if a very minute quantity ( ten parts per million by weight ) of the polymer poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( pmma ) was added to a newtonian liquid ( monochlorobenzene ) flowing through a pipe at high reynolds numbers , the turbulent motion of the latter could be suppressed considerably @xcite .",
    "it is now understood that the addition of pmma reduces the pressure drop across the pipe and results in a significant reduction in skin friction . a reduction in turbulent flow",
    "is also observed when the polymer polyisobutylene ( pib ) is dispersed in benzene or cyclohexane , and when peo or pam are dispersed in turbulent water @xcite .",
    "when the concentration of polymer additives is gradually increased , drag reduction ( dr ) increases upto a saturation value , before eventually decreasing @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is widely utilized in irrigation networks , sewerage systems , oil pipelines and for extending the range of fire - fighting equipment .",
    "flexible polymers of very high molecular weights , typically composed of 10@xmath57 - 10@xmath58 monomeric units , are the most effective as drag reducing agents @xcite .    for a closed turbulent flow with zero mean velocity ,",
    "two types of forcings were used in @xcite : a smooth forcing in which the fluid motion was driven by the viscous boundary layers , and a rough forcing in which the fluid was stirred with baffles .",
    "when a minute quantity of a polymer ( thirty parts per million by weight ) is added , there is a significant reduction in the turbulent energy dissipation in the smooth forcing experiment . in the rough stirring experiment ,",
    "no such reduction is seen . although the understanding of this phenomenon is still far from complete , dr is generally believed to originate from boundary layer effects @xcite .",
    "it should be noted here that some experiments reported in the literature imply the existence of very different mechanisms driving dr .",
    "for example , another study has shown that when the polymer is injected at the centre of the pipe , fluid turbulence is reduced even before the injected polymer reaches the boundary walls @xcite .    the introduction of a polymer additive results in significant changes in the cascade of eddies generated in a newtonian liquid .",
    "this alters its dissipation behaviour @xcite .",
    "dr is observed when the wall shear stress is larger than a threshold value , as the flow must first stretch the polymers out from their initial globular configurations @xcite .",
    "it has already been pointed out that while the addition of a small amount of polymer does not change the shear viscosity of a fluid significantly , its elongational viscosity can increase by many orders of magnitude @xcite . in @xcite , common salt was added to increase the flexibility of polyelectrolyte chains ( @xmath59-dna and hydrolysed polyacrilamide ) .",
    "this makes the chains more resistant to stretching out in elongational flows and increases the elongational viscosity of the solution .",
    "when small amounts of these polyelectrolytes are added to a turbulent newtonian fluid , dr increases almost linearly with increase in the solution s elongational viscosity .",
    "dr also increases with increase in the reynolds number @xmath60 . here ,",
    "@xmath61 and @xmath6 are respectively the density and shear viscosity of the fluid , @xmath62 is the speed of the rotational motion imposed to generate turbulence , and @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the radius of the inner cylinder and the gap of the couette geometry , respectively . in @xcite",
    ", nacl was again added to tune the persistence lengths of @xmath59-dna chains in an aqueous solution .",
    "these experiments demonstrate that turbulent energy dissipation reduces with chain flexibility , and a minimum chain flexibility is essential for dr . in a @xmath59-dna solution with no added nacl , a significant enhancement in drag is observed .",
    "surfactants present in water during turbulent pipe flow can reduce drag effectively when they self - assemble into rod - like micelles .",
    "the extent of dr is a strong function of the micellar size , number density and surface charge @xcite . for every micellar system",
    "investigated , there exists an absolute temperature @xmath65 , which depends on the hydrophobic chain length of the surfactant and the concentration of counterions in solution , above which there is no dr .",
    "it is now believed that dr in these systems is facilitated by the formation of shear - induced structures that increase wall - slip @xcite .",
    "fluid turbulence occurs when inertial driving forces are much larger than viscous damping forces @xcite and is accompanied by an enhancement in drag and in spatial and temporal velocity fluctuations .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that these features can exist even in the low reynolds number flow ( @xmath66 1 ) of highly elastic polymer solutions .",
    "in contrast , the critical reynolds number for the onset of turbulence in newtonian liquids , @xmath67 10@xmath58 @xcite .    clearly , inertia is negligible in the turbulent flow of polymer solutions .",
    "the role of inertia is played by elastic stresses and the flow is described in terms of an elasticity parameter @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the weissenberg number . here",
    ", @xmath70 is the kinematic viscosity and @xmath71 is a characteristic length scale .",
    "this phenomenon , called elastic turbulence , occurs at high @xmath72 and low @xmath73 and is driven by the nonlinearities that are inherent in the mechanical response of the polymer solution @xcite .",
    "polymer molecules , when stretched by flow , become unstable and give rise to irregular secondary flows . these secondary flows , through a feedback mechanism , stretch the polymers even further and fully developed turbulence eventually sets in .",
    "elastic turbulence is characterised by a large increase in the flow resistance and , in sharp contrast to inertial turbulence , increases with increase in solution viscosity .",

    "elastic turbulence and taylor - like vortices were reported in the coutte flow of wormlike micellar solutions undergoing shear banding @xcite , and in the curvilinear flow of polymer solutions @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated that two very viscous liquids flowing in a curved channel can be mixed very efficiently at low @xmath73 if very small quantities of polymers are added to the former @xcite .",

    "in this section , we turn our attention to structure - flow correlations in sheared surfactant aggregates .",
    "when surfactants , which are amphiphilic macromolecules consisting of a hydrophilic ( water - loving ) ` head ' and a hydrophobic ( water - hating ) ` tail ' , are dissolved in water at certain concentrations and temperatures , they self - assemble to form spherical micelles , long chain - like supramolecular structures called giant wormlike micelles ( gwms ) , lamellar phases , onions _ etc .",
    "when aqueous solutions of gwms are subjected to high shear rates , the wormlike chains disentangle , break , and eventually stretch in the direction of flow @xcite .",

    "an intruder that is larger than the thin , downward granular stream can be carried by the convection roll to the top of the container where it stays trapped , thus producing the bne @xcite . when a binary granular mixture is vibrated vertically keeping @xmath138 fixed , but at different @xmath143 values , the small particles are seen to accumulate at the bottom of the container for low values of @xmath143 ( when 1@xmath1483.5 ) . for larger @xmath143 ( when @xmath149 3.5 ) , the small particles rises to the top ( rbne ) @xcite . + for a quasi two - dimensional bed of small particles vertically vibrated at a small @xmath141 , the rise of the intruder is driven by the successive formation and destruction of granular arches @xcite . for large @xmath141 , the intruder rise is driven by granular convection .",
    "the transition between these two regimes depends on the size ratio of the intruder and the bed particles .",
    "high speed imaging for a quasi two - dimensional geometry shows that convective motion can exist at low @xmath141 @xcite . in these experiments , the intruder and the bed particles",

    "the effects of drag forces on granular segregation was investigated by inducing gas flow through the perforated base of a granular bed @xcite .",
    "more recently , purely convection - driven segregation was uncovered in the rise of a large intruder through a vibrated granular bed packed with tiny seeds @xcite .",
    "this work reports that t@xmath150 , where @xmath135 is the minimum shaking velocity required for the onset of bulk convection rolls in the granular bed , and the constant @xmath79 depends on the aspect ratio of the bed .",

    "numerical simulations are performed to verify that the competition between frictional and capillary forces drives the formation of the observed patterns .",
    "it has been mentioned earlier that the surface tension of granular matter is negligible when compared to ordinary liquids .",
