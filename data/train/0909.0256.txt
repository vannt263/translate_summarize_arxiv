    "this paper concerns the problem of _ quantum channel discrimination_. in this problem , two quantum channels @xmath0 and @xmath1 are fixed , and access to one of the two channels is made available .",
    "it is not known which of the two channels has been made available , however , and the goal is to correctly identify which of @xmath0 and @xmath1 it is .",
    "several papers , including @xcite , have discovered many interesting aspects of quantum channel discrimination . there",
    "exist related topics in the study of quantum information theory , including _ quantum parameter estimation _ ( see , for instance @xcite and the references therein ) , but this paper will focus just on the specific problem of channel discrimination .",
    "a _ discrimination strategy _ for a quantum channel discrimination problem is a step - by - step procedure consisting of channel evaluations , along with quantum state preparations , operations , and measurements , that attempts to output the identity of the given channel . generally speaking , one",
    "is typically interested in discrimination strategies that satisfy certain natural constraints ; with one well - studied example being the discrimination strategies allowing a _ single evaluation _ of the unknown channel .",
    "an _ optimal _ discrimination strategy , among those satisfying a given collection of constraints , is simply one that maximizes the probability that the unknown channel is correctly identified , assuming it is selected according to a fixed distribution that is known ahead of time .",
    "one interesting aspect of quantum channel discrimination is that the use of an _ ancillary _ system is generally necessary for the optimal discrimination of two quantum channels , assuming just a single evaluation of the unknown channel is made available @xcite . in more precise terms , the optimal strategy to discriminate two channels may require that one first prepares the input system to the unknown channel in an entangled state with an ancillary system , followed by a joint measurement of that channel s output together with the ancillary system .",
    "even _ entanglement - breaking _ channels are sometimes better discriminated through the use of an ancillary system , despite the fact that their output systems must necessarily be unentangled with the ancillary system after their evaluation @xcite .",
    "there are two known special classes of channels that require no ancillary system for optimal discrimination : the unitary channels @xcite and the classical channels .",
    "there is a striking possibility for quantum channel discrimination problems that can not occur in the classical setting .",
    "if a pair of classical channels can not be perfectly distinguished with one evaluation , then they can not be perfectly distinguished with any finite number of evaluations .",
    "( this fact is easily proved , and a simple proof may be found later in the paper . )",
    "in contrast , it is possible for a pair of quantum channels to be discriminated perfectly when multiple evaluations are available , but not in the single evaluation case .",
    "for example , this generally happens in the case of unitary channels @xcite .",
    "another interesting aspect of quantum channel discrimination is the distinction between _ adaptive _ and _ non - adaptive _ strategies when multiple uses of the unknown channel are made available . in an adaptive strategy , one may use the outputs of previous uses of the channel when preparing the input to subsequent uses , whereas a non - adaptive strategy requires that the inputs to all uses of the given channel are chosen before any of them is evaluated .",
    "it was found in @xcite that unitary channels are insensitive to this distinction ; adaptive strategies do not give any advantage over non - adaptive strategies for unitary channel discrimination .",
    "in the same paper , a pair of _ memory channels _ was shown to require an adaptive scheme for optimal discrimination , but the question of whether or not there exist ordinary ( non - memory ) channels with a similar property was stated as an open question . although an example of _ three _ channels that require adaptive strategies for an optimal identification was presented in @xcite , we were not able to find any example of a pair of ( ordinary , non - memory ) channels in the literature that require adaptive strategies for optimal discrimination ; and so the question appears to have been unresolved prior to this work .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to demonstrate the necessity of adaptive schemes for optimal quantum channel discrimination .",
    "we do this by presenting an example of two quantum channels that can be perfectly discriminated given two adaptive channel evaluations , but for which _ no finite number _ of non - adaptive channel evaluations allows for a perfect discrimination .",
    "the channels in our example are _ entanglement - breaking _ channels , which provides further evidence suggesting that entanglement - breaking channels share similar properties to general quantum channels with respect to channel discrimination tasks .",
    "we note that a recent paper of duan , feng , and ying @xcite has provided a criterion for the perfect discrimination of pairs of quantum channels , as well as a general method to find adaptive strategies that allow for perfect discrimination .",
    "while no explicit examples were given in that paper , the existence of pairs of channels with similar properties to those in our example is implied .",
    "our example was , however , obtained independently from that paper , and we hope that it offers some insight into the problem of quantum channel discrimination that is complementary to @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that a related ( but weaker ) phenomenon occurs in the context of classical channel discrimination . that is , there exist classical channels that can be better discriminated by adaptive strategies than by non - adaptive strategies , and we provide three simple examples illustrating this phenomenon .",
    "while we suspect that similar examples illustrating the advantages of adaptive discrimination strategies may be known to some researchers , we did not find any in the literature . that such examples exist",
    "is also interesting when contrasted with the fact that adaptive strategies for classical channel discrimination can not improve the asymptotic rate at which the error probability exponentially decays with the number of channel uses  @xcite .",
    "we will begin by summarizing some of the notation and terminology that is used in the subsequent sections of the paper .",
    "we will let @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote finite - dimensional complex hilbert spaces , which will typically correspond to the input , output , and ancillary systems to be associated with channel discrimination tasks .",
    "the notation @xmath5 refers to the space of all linear operators from @xmath2 to @xmath3 , @xmath6 is shorthand for @xmath7 , and @xmath8 refers to the set of all density operators on @xmath2 .",
    "a similar notation is used for other spaces in place of @xmath2 and @xmath3 . the identity operator on @xmath2",
    "is denoted  @xmath9 .    for the example to be presented in the main part of the paper , we will let @xmath2 and @xmath3 be the spaces associated with two qubits and one qubit , respectively .",
    "the standard bases for these spaces are therefore @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "as is common , we will also write @xmath12 and we write tensor products of these states and standard basis states in a self - explanatory way ( e.g. , @xmath13 ) .    a _",
    "quantum channel _ is a linear mapping of the form @xmath14 that is both completely positive and trace - preserving .",
    "every such quantum channel @xmath15 can be expressed in kraus form as @xmath16 for some choice of linear operators @xmath17 satisfying the constraint @xmath18 the identity channel mapping @xmath19 to itself is denoted @xmath20 .",
    "the distinguishability of two quantum channels @xmath21 may be quantified by the distance induced by the _ diamond norm _ ( or _ completely bounded trace norm _ )",
    "@xmath22 where here @xmath4 is assumed to have dimension at least that of @xmath2 .",
    "this quantity represents the greatest possible degree of distinguishability that can result by feeding an input state into the two channels , allowing for the possibility that the input system is entangled with an ancillary system . assuming that a bit @xmath23 is uniformly chosen at random",
    ", the quantity @xmath24 represents the optimal probability to correctly determine the value of @xmath25 by means of a physical process involving just a single evaluation of the channel @xmath26 .",
    "it therefore holds that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are perfectly distinguishable using a single evaluation if and only if @xmath27 .",
    "we now describe our example of two quantum channels that are better discriminated using an adaptive strategy than by any non - adaptive strategy .",
    "first , we will give an intuitive description of the channels .",
    "the two channels , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , both map two qubits to one and operate as follows .",
    "2.5ex    channel @xmath0 measures the first input qubit with respect to the standard basis . if the result is 0 , it outputs the state @xmath28 .",
    "if the result is 1 , it measures the second qubit with respect to the standard basis .",
    "if the result is 0 , then it outputs 0 , and if the result is 1 , then it outputs the completely mixed state @xmath29 .",
    "channel @xmath1 measures the first input qubit with respect to the standard basis .",
    "if the result is 0 , it outputs the state @xmath30 .",
    "if the result is 1 , it measures the second qubit with respect to the @xmath31 basis . if the result is @xmath32 , then it outputs 1 , and if the result is @xmath33 , then it outputs the completely mixed state @xmath29 .",
    "the intuition behind these channels is as follows .",
    "if the first input qubit is set to 0 , then the output is a `` key '' state : @xmath28 for channel @xmath0 and @xmath30 for the channel @xmath1 .",
    "if the first input is set to 1 , and the second input qubit is the channel s `` key '' state , then the channel identifies itself ( i.e. , @xmath0 outputs 0 and @xmath1 outputs  1 ) .",
    "if , however , the first input qubit is set to 1 and the second qubit s state is orthogonal to the channel s `` key '' state , then the channel outputs the completely mixed state .",
    "this effectively means that the channel provides no information about its identity in this case .",
    "it is easy to discriminate these two channels with an adaptive strategy that requires two uses of the unknown channel .",
    "the following diagram describes such a strategy :    = 0.25pt    ( 1000 , 400)(0,0 ) ( first)(200,200)@xmath26 ( second)(800,200)@xmath26 ( in1)(0,250)@xmath28 ( in2)(0,150)@xmath34 ( in3)(600,250)@xmath35 ( out)(1000,200)@xmath36 ( in1,first ) ( in2,first ) ( in3,second ) ( first,10,320,second,190,320 ) ( second , out ) ( in2,first ) ( in3,second ) ( first,10,320,second,190,320 ) ( second , out )    here , the state @xmath34 input as the second qubit of the first channel evaluation is arbitrary , as it is effectively discarded by both of the channels when the first input qubit is set to @xmath28 .    in the interest of precision , and because it will be useful for the analysis of the next section , we note the following formal specifications of these channels .",
    "it holds that @xmath37 for    5 a_1 & = | 0 00 | , & a_2 & = | 0 01 | , & a_3 & = | 0 10 | , & a_4 & = | 0 11 | , & a_5 & = | 1 11 | , + b_1 & = | + 00 | , & b_2 & = | + 01 | , & b_3 & = | 1 1 + | , & b_4 & = | 0 1- | , & b_5 & = | 1 1- | .",
    "it is clear that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are both entanglement - breaking channels , as all of these kraus operators have rank one @xcite .",
    "we now prove that non - adaptive strategies can not allow for a perfect discrimination of the channels @xmath0 and @xmath1 defined in the previous section , for any finite number @xmath38 of channel uses . in more precise terms",
    ", we have @xmath39 for all choices of @xmath40 .",
    "we first prove a simpler mathematical fact , which is that there does not exist a two - qubit density operator @xmath34 for which @xmath41 and @xmath42 are perfectly distinguishable .",
    "as we will see , the proof is similar when taking the tensor product of the channel with itself or with an identity channel that acts on an auxiliary system .",
    "this handles the multiple - copy case with the possible use of an ancillary space , thus establishing the more general statement above .",
    "assume toward contradiction that there exists a density operator @xmath34 such that @xmath41 and @xmath42 are perfectly distinguishable . by a simple convexity argument",
    ", we may assume that the same is true for a pure state @xmath43 in place of @xmath34 .",
    "in other words , there exists a unit vector @xmath44 satisfying @xmath45 expanding this equation in terms of the kraus operators of @xmath0 and @xmath1 yields @xmath46 each of the terms in this sum is nonnegative , and must therefore be zero , i.e. , @xmath47 for all choices of @xmath48 .",
    "it follows that @xmath49 for every choice of complex numbers @xmath50 .",
    "we will now obtain a contradiction by choosing the coefficients @xmath50 in such a way that can not hold .",
    "in particular , by letting @xmath51 and letting @xmath52 for all of the remaining values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 , we find that @xmath55 for @xmath56 the operator @xmath57 is positive definite and therefore @xmath58 for every nonzero vector @xmath44 , which is in contradiction with .",
    "having established a contradiction , we conclude that there can not exist a density operator @xmath34 such that @xmath41 and @xmath42 are perfectly distinguishable as claimed .",
    "now let us consider the general setting where an arbitrary finite number @xmath38 of ( non - adaptive ) channel uses , as well as an ancillary system of arbitrary size , are permitted .",
    "we may follow a similar proof to the one above to show that there can not exist a unit vector @xmath44 such that @xmath59 = 0 \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the space ( of arbitrary finite dimension ) that is to be associated with the ancillary system .",
    "we may express the relevant mappings in this expression in terms of the kraus operators of @xmath0 and @xmath1 as follows : @xmath60    now , for the same coefficients @xmath50 that were defined above , we find that @xmath611\\leq k_1,\\ldots , k_n\\leq 5 } } \\alpha_{j_1,k_1 } \\cdots \\alpha_{j_n , k_n } \\ ;   b_{j_1}^{\\ast}a_{k_1 } \\otimes\\cdots\\otimes b_{k_n}^{\\ast } a_{j_n } \\otimes \\i_{\\w } \\;=\\ ; p^{\\otimes n } \\otimes \\i_{\\w},\\ ] ] which is again positive definite .",
    "therefore , there can not exist a nonzero vector @xmath44 for which @xmath62 for all @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "consequently , does not hold for any nonzero vector @xmath44 , which implies that @xmath0 and @xmath1 can not be perfectly discriminated by means of a non - adaptive strategy .",
    "when the number of evaluations @xmath38 of the unknown channel is small , one can efficiently compute the value @xmath65 because it is the optimal value of a semidefinite programming problem @xcite .",
    "for instance , it holds that @xmath66 and therefore the channels can be discriminated with a probability @xmath67 of correctness with just a single channel evaluation . for two non - adaptive queries , we used ` cvx ` @xcite , a package for specifying and solving convex programs in matlab , to approximate the value @xmath68 one can also obtain an upper bound on the probability of success using any feasible solution to the dual problem .",
    "in fact , even obvious choices give fairly tight upper bounds .",
    "thus , we establish a small , but finite , advantage of an adaptive strategy over a non - adaptive one for discriminating these channels .",
    "the channels in our example above are entanglement - breaking channels , yet the optimal adaptive discriminating strategy operates in a distinctively quantum way : one out of two nonorthogonal key states is extracted from the first channel evaluation and coherently input to the second . a natural question arises , which is whether adaptive strategies also help when discriminating _ classical _ channels .",
    "it turns out that adaptive strategies indeed are better in the classical setting , although in a more limited respect .",
    "this section discusses a few basic facts and examples that illustrate this claim .",
    "a classical channel can , of course , be succinctly represented by a stochastic matrix @xmath69 , where the vector @xmath70 represents the output distribution when the input is @xmath54 . throughout this section",
    ", we will let @xmath71 and @xmath72 denote the two possible channels in a classical channel discrimination problem .",
    "we will present three examples illustrating that adaptive strategies may give advantages over non - adaptive strategies for classical channel discrimination , restricting our attention to the special case where just two channel evaluations are permitted , and where one of two channels is given with equal probability .",
    "we have the following expression for the optimal success probability using an adaptive strategy in this setting : @xmath73 in this expression , @xmath53 and @xmath54 range over all outputs and inputs , respectively , of the channels @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( i.e. , they are row and column indices ) .",
    "the function @xmath74 ranges over all maps from outputs to inputs ( or row indices to column indices ) .    an alternate expression for the optimal success probability is @xmath75 where @xmath76 and where @xmath77 is the probability that the unknown channel is @xmath78 , conditioned on @xmath54 being chosen as the input and @xmath53 being obtained as the output .",
    "this illustrates that , at least for strategies allowing just two channel evaluations , that the optimal adaptive strategy for two uses of a classical channel can be readily found , by first finding the optimal input for each prior distribution over the chosen channel ( this may be the input in the second use ) .",
    "we then compute the success probability given every prior distribution and one use of the channel . finally , to choose an input to the first use of the channel , we choose an input which maximizes the probability of getting each prior times the success probability given that prior .",
    "* example 1 .",
    "* this `` minimal '' example shows that adaptive strategies are better than nonadaptive ones in some cases .",
    "the two channels are given by : @xmath79    2/3 & 1/9   \\end{pmatrix } , \\quad\\quad m_1 = \\begin{pmatrix }     0 & 1/3\\\\[2 mm ]    1 & 2/3 \\end{pmatrix}.\\ ] ] one can verify that the best two - evaluation non - adaptive strategy is to input @xmath80 to both of the channel uses , which leads to a correct identification with probability @xmath81 . the best adaptive strategy is to take @xmath82 and @xmath83 in the formula , which gives a correct identification with probability @xmath84 .",
    "similar examples are abundant .",
    "* example 2 . * here , the optimal 1-shot input is never used in the optimal non - adaptive scheme .",
    "the idea is to start with two optimal @xmath80-shot inputs @xmath85 such that using @xmath86 becomes more informative with @xmath87 parallel uses .",
    "then we perturb the @xmath54-th column slightly so that @xmath54 becomes the unique optimal @xmath80-shot input . in this example",
    ", the optimal @xmath80-shot input @xmath54 still serves as the first input to the optimal adaptive scheme .",
    "let the two channels be given by : @xmath88 0.14 &   0.1   &   0 &   0.5 \\\\[2 mm ] 0     &   0.45 &   0 &   0 \\end{pmatrix } , \\quad\\quad m_1 = \\begin{pmatrix }   0.15 &   0.1 &   0.5 &   0 \\\\[2 mm ] 0.85 &   0.8 &   0.5 &   1 \\\\[2 mm ] 0     &   0.1 &   0    &   0 \\end{pmatrix}.\\ ] ] the best one - shot input is @xmath89 ( probability of success is 0.855 ) ( whereas @xmath90 ) .",
    "the best parallel input pairs are @xmath91 and @xmath92 ( probability of success is 0.9 ) .",
    "allowing adaptation , and using @xmath89 as the first input , @xmath93 , the probability of success is 0.9275 .",
    "* example 3 . * in this final example , the optimal @xmath80-shot input is _ not _ the first input to the optimal adaptive scheme . the idea is to have two optimal @xmath80-shot inputs in which one is more informative than the other if given a second use .",
    "then , we perturb the column corresponding to the less informative input to be slightly better for the @xmath80-shot case .",
    "let the two channels be given by : @xmath94    0 &   0.5 &   0.092 &   0.04\\\\[2 mm ]    0 &   0    &   0.08   &   0.2 \\end{pmatrix } , \\quad\\quad m_1 = \\begin{pmatrix }     0.5 &   0 &   0.092 &   0.04\\\\[2 mm ]    0.5 &   1 &   0.828 &   0.76\\\\[2 mm ]    0    &   0 &   0.08   &   0.2 \\end{pmatrix},\\ ] ] the best one - shot input is @xmath95 ( probability of success is 0.868 ) but the best parallel input pairs to two uses are @xmath96 and @xmath97 ( probability of success is 0.9336 ) .",
    "the optimal adaptive scheme uses @xmath98 as the first input , and @xmath99 for @xmath100 , resulting in a probability of success of 0.9536 .",
    "finally , we give a simple proof of a fact claimed in the introduction of this paper , which is that if two classical channels are not perfectly distinguishable with a single evaluation , then they can not be perfectly distinguished by any finite number of evaluations , even using an adaptive strategy .",
