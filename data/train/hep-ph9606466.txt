    "in addition to those which have already been observed , the minimal supersymmetric standard model predicts a plethora of new particles . among these new states is the superpartner of the gluon , a color octet majorana fermion known as the gluino .",
    "it is generally believed that the superpartners of the known particles should have masses of order @xmath2 gev , but experimental searches have yet to find any direct evidence for supersymmetry .",
    "some authors , however , have argued that a very light gluino with a mass in the several hundred mev range is difficult to exclude on the basis of present data @xcite .",
    "a number of experiments have searched for light gluinos .",
    "the persistently negative results obtained have been used to exclude large ranges of masses and lifetimes for this particle .",
    "these experiments include various beam dump experiments @xcite , searches for exotic particles in various mass and lifetime ranges @xcite , searches for gluino - containing hadrons produced in @xmath3 and @xmath4 decay @xcite , and collider searches @xcite .",
    "taken at face value , these experiments exclude all but a few narrow windows for the light gluino . it has been argued , however , that the excluded range may have been overestimated @xcite , and that sizable allowed regions remain .",
    "very recently , data from the fermilab e761 experiment @xcite have been re - analyzed to derive bounds on the production rate of gluino - containing baryons with lifetimes in the range 50 to 500 picoseconds .",
    "this experiment placed stringent constraints on the fraction of gluino - containing baryons that are produced when 800 gev protons are incident on a copper target .",
    "the fraction is found to be less than about @xmath5 for relatively light ( @xmath6 gev ) gluino containing baryons .",
    "however , the acceptance of the experiment is not sufficient to place as stringent bounds on the production fraction of heavier ( @xmath7 gev ) supersymmetric baryons .",
    "there is some controversy regarding the exact mass and lifetime regions allowed for light gluinos .",
    "a fairly liberal estimate of the allowed regions may be found in ref .",
    "it is argued there that gluinos which hadronize into gluino - gluon bound states of mass less than about 2 gev are allowed for certain lifetime ranges , and that a gluino of mass greater than about 4 gev is allowed with certain lifetimes in the range greater than about @xmath8 seconds .",
    "some of the experiments cited above claim that the allowed regions are smaller .    the searches discussed above run into potential difficulties either because of non - perturbative hadronic uncertainties , or because of the possibility of a long gluino lifetime .",
    "high @xmath1 jet physics has the potential to skirt around some of these difficulties .",
    "this is mainly because the essential physics is perturbative , and the final result is rather insensitive to the mass of the light gluino . in this letter , we investigate whether jet production data in @xmath0 collisions can be used to differentiate between the standard model and the standard model plus a light , long lived , gluino .    in @xmath9 collisions ,",
    "gluinos do not participate in the hard scattering , and their effect on the quark distributions has been found to be negligible @xcite . in contrast , jet production in @xmath0 collisions is sensitive to the gluino at leading order in perturbation theory .",
    "one might suspect the effect on jet cross sections to be rather large since a single majorana gluino , in many cases , has the same effect as three light quarks .",
    "below , we estimate the effect of a light gluino on @xmath0 jet production rates by calculating the single - jet - inclusive @xmath1 spectrum .",
    "we will show that competing effects tend to suppress the effect of a light gluino .    before proceeding ,",
    "it is worth noting a few of the assumptions implicit in our work .",
    "first , we assume that gluinos , if they exist , are sufficiently long lived that they will hadronize and form jets in the same manner as other strongly interacting particles .",
    "we furthermore assume that the missing energy resulting from gluino decay into photinos or other weakly interacting particles is negligible .",
    "we also assume that other strongly interacting supersymmetric particles , such as squarks , are sufficiently heavy that their effects can be neglected ; the presence of a few hundred gev squark would lead to a peak in the dijet mass distribution not predicted by standard model physics @xcite .",
    "( as yet , no such peak has been established @xcite in the data . )",
    "the layout of this letter is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ jetspectrum ] , we discuss the effects of a light gluino on the single - jet - inclusive @xmath1 spectrum . in sec .",
    "[ vsexperiment ] , we review the relevant experimental results , and discuss what can be said about a light gluino on the basis of our calculation . sec .",
    "[ summary ] concludes .",
    "in order to estimate the effect of a light gluino on the single - jet inclusive cross section we have modified the jet monte carlo program jetrad @xcite to include gluinos both in the evolution of @xmath10 and in the hard scattering processes .",
    "parton densities for the proton that include a gluino have been obtained from the authors of ref .",
    "all of the calculations presented here have been performed to leading order in the qcd coupling parameter , @xmath10 , using a two - loop running of the coupling . in order to match to cdf parameters ,",
    "the computation was performed for transverse energies , @xmath1 , in the range @xmath11 and for pseudorapidities , @xmath12 , in the range @xmath13 . following standard choices ,",
    "the renormalization and factorization scales have been set equal to one half of the @xmath1 of the leading jet .",
    "since we are primarily interested in the effect of a gluino on the shape of the @xmath1 spectrum , leading order perturbation theory is sufficient for our purposes . for standard qcd ,",
    "the main effect of next - to - leading order corrections is to rescale this cross section by a nearly constant ` @xmath14-factor ' over the entire range of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "( using jetrad we have verfied this with the above choice of parameters . )",
    "the light gluino has three main effects on the jet @xmath1 spectrum : it modifies the running of @xmath10 , introduces new states into the scattering process , and modifies the dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) @xcite evolution of the parton densities . in order to obtain a proper estimate of the effect",
    "we must include all three of these effects as they are equally important .",
    "below we consider how each of these three effects alter the theoretical prediction of the single - jet - inclusive cross section .",
    "we shall find that although the first two tend to increase the cross section preferentially in the high @xmath1 region , the inclusion of a gluino in the parton distributions tends to cancel part of this increase .",
    "the evolution of the coupling constant is controlled by the beta - function @xmath15 + { \\cal o}(g^5 ) \\",
    ", ,   \\equn\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the number of quarks , @xmath17 is the number of gluinos which we take to be either zero or one , and @xmath18 is the number of colors . in running the coupling",
    "we follow the standard prescription that below a particle threshold the effect of that particle is ignored , but at threshold the contribution to the beta - function is turned on .",
    "( to maintain consistency with the conventions of ref .",
    "@xcite we take the threshold to be twice the mass of the parton  our final results are insensitive to this choice . )",
    "the addition of a light fermionic degree of freedom slows the running of @xmath10 , since it makes the beta function less negative .",
    "indeed , it has been argued that a light gluino could resolve the long - standing but small disagreement between measurements of @xmath10 at low scales ( @xmath19 gev ) and at high scales ( @xmath20 gev ) @xcite .    starting from the measured value of the strong coupling constant in deep inelastic scattering experiments , a light gluino shifts the value at the @xmath21-resonance from @xmath22 to @xmath23 .",
    "these values of @xmath10 are dictated by our choice of parton distribution functions . since leading order contributions to the single - jet - inclusive production rate are proportional to two powers of @xmath10",
    ", this causes about a 17% rise in the high @xmath1 end of the spectrum .",
    "( the coupling constant at about 10 gev is the same with or without gluinos since it is constrained by the deep inelastic scattering data @xcite . )    in we plot the       -.7 cm    quantity '' as a shorthand for the quantity @xmath24 . in the limit @xmath25",
    "this is exact .",
    "for all of the graphs presented here @xmath26 gev , a value sufficiently small for our purposes .",
    "] @xmath27 computed with various gluino contributions turned on in the ` with @xmath28 ' part . since these curves are generated with a leading order calculation ( and because of normalization uncertainties in the experiments ) , one must be cautious in interpreting the overall normalization ; however , the shape of the distribution may be expected to be more robust so that is what we focus on here .",
    "the dotted curve in represents the case with a gluino enhanced coupling constant , but with conventional qcd matrix elements and parton distributions .",
    "these results have been calculated using the mrsd0@xmath29 @xcite partons , for which the fitted value of @xmath30 is @xmath31 .",
    "we use the mrsd0@xmath29 partons as a reference point in order to maintain consistency with the parton distributions of ref .",
    "@xcite which incorporate gluinos , and which will be used below .",
    "observe that although the modified running of @xmath10 gives an upward tilt to the @xmath1 spectrum , most of the rise is concentrated in the lower energy range .",
    "we note in passing that the 17% enhancement obtained here using two - loop evolution of @xmath10 is reduced to 14% if one - loop evolution is used .",
    "the second contribution to the jet cross section comes from the fact that the gluinos can participate in the hard scattering .",
    "modern methods for computing qcd and supersymmetric amplitudes can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . for completeness",
    ", we list the relevant squared matrix elements ( summed over all helicities and colors ) as follows , @xmath32 \\ , .",
    "\\cr } \\equn \\label{matrix}\\ ] ] here , @xmath33 are the usual mandelstam variables .",
    "we use the convention that all particles are in the final state , and the squared matrix elements do not include phase space symmetry factors . since the typical energy scales probed in jet physics are much higher than the masses of the individual fermions , it is a reasonable approximation to treat the lighter quarks and the gluino as massless .",
    "the standard qcd squared matrix elements may be found , for example , in ref .",
    "( as is usual in jet calculations , we have ignored the top quark . )    including the effect of gluinos in the final states together with the enhanced coupling we obtain the dashed line in .",
    "thus , by ignoring the effect of the light gluino on the initial state partons we obtain an overall enhancement of the cross section as well as an overall upward tilt in the @xmath1 spectrum , on the order of 26% .",
    "similar upward tilts have been presented in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally , the gluino also modifies the parton densities of the proton .",
    "the gluino affects these densities in two ways . in the dglap equations there are new channels , and there is also an overall increase in their rate of evolution due to the larger coupling constant .    the effect of a low mass gluino on parton densities has been considered in refs .",
    "a light gluino has a negligibly small effect on deep inelastic scattering data , including the kinematic region explored at hera @xcite .",
    "this is because deep inelastic scattering is sensitive primarily to the quark distributions , and these distributions are quite insensitive to the introduction of a light gluino .",
    "the effect of the gluino on the gluon distribution is much larger , but deep inelastic scattering is rather insensitive to the gluon component of the proton .",
    "since gluons participate directly in the hard scattering at @xmath0 colliders ( dominating the low @xmath34 contribution ) , jet production is sensitive to the gluon density in the proton .",
    "modifications to the gluons , therefore , can not be ignored .",
    "the solid line in shows the complete effect of including a 5 gev gluino ; it includes the modified coupling , the new matrix elements and modified parton distribution functions .",
    "( below we discuss the effect of reducing the gluino mass . ) this set of partons was generated by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , by modifying the analysis used to obtain the standard mrsd0@xmath29 structure functions .",
    "the fact that the solid line in shows a smaller rise than the dotted and dashed lines , as we look from low to high @xmath1 , can be traced back to the softening of the gluon and quark distribution functions in the presence of a gluino . by softening we mean that the distribution functions carry less of the proton s momentum and are shifted to smaller @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath35 and @xmath36 quark densities at moderate @xmath34 are reduced primarily as a result of the larger value of @xmath10 in the presence of the gluino .",
    "this larger value of @xmath10 leads to a more rapid evolution of the quark densities , which in turn reduces the quark densities by a few percent at factorization scales @xmath37 gev and @xmath34 greater than about 0.1 .",
    "the gluon distribution is reduced by the larger value of @xmath10 and the fact that gluons can ` split ' into gluinos under the dglap evolution .",
    "this leads to a reduction of about 10% in the gluon density at factorization scales @xmath38 of order 100 gev .",
    "in we display the       -.7 cm    gluon momentum distribution with and without a light gluino .",
    "we give the gluon distributions for two factorization scales , @xmath39 and @xmath40 gev ; these span the scales probed by the tevatron single - jet - inclusive experiments .",
    "the effect of this softening on the @xmath1 spectrum is displayed in .",
    "here we show , as in       -.7 cm    fig  [ withgluinofigure ] , the fractional change in the jet @xmath1 spectrum using the gluino - modified parton distributions of ref .",
    "@xcite , omitting all other effects of the light gluino . in other words , we have plotted the standard qcd processes convoluted with the standard model subset of the modified parton distributions , and adopted the standard ( mrsd0@xmath41 ) running of the coupling .",
    "this shows the origin of the cancellation seen in : the gluon and quark distributions become softer .",
    "of course , this downward shift in the cross section is reduced somewhat when initial state gluino scattering is included in the calculation .",
    "the cross section for gluino scattering is displayed in for the case of a 5 gev gluino .",
    "we see that       -.7 cm    this portion of the cross section is significant only at low @xmath1 , and falls off much more rapidly than quark and gluon scattering cross sections with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "thus , in this case initial state gluinos lead to a negligible increase in the high @xmath1 end of the spectrum .",
    "the sharp falloff of the gluino contributions may be understood from the fact that at high @xmath34 there is little gluino component to the parton distribution functions ; furthermore there is no @xmath42-channel scattering of gluinos and quarks , whose distribution is sizeable at high @xmath34 .",
    "the results presented so far assume a 5 gev gluino mass , but we are primarily interested in gluinos with a mass of order 1 gev .",
    "we expect that the effects described above will persist for smaller gluino masses for the following reasons .",
    "firstly , as we saw above , the introduction of a gluino gives an upward tilt to the jet @xmath1 spectrum through the modified running of @xmath10 , and the introduction of new final states in quark and gluon scattering .",
    "both of these effects are largely unchanged if we reduce the gluino mass from 5 gev to 1 gev .",
    "secondly , we note that the quark distributions are determined by fitting to deep inelastic scattering data , and are very weakly modified by the introduction of a light gluino @xcite . as these distributions",
    "are evolved to higher factorization scales , they are modified somewhat by the larger value of @xmath10 .",
    "however , this effect is largely independent of the gluino mass . as a result",
    ", a lower gluino mass can only result in a smaller gluon density inside the proton , compensated for by a larger gluino density .",
    "in the same way as was found above , the reduction in the gluon density may be expected to lessen the upward tilt in the single - jet - inclusive @xmath1 spectrum . to see this , we note that the parton densities inside the proton are only logarithmically sensitive to the gluino mass . for the enhanced gluino content of the proton to overcome the decrease in the gluon content , from , we would require as a lower bound an order of magnitude increase in the high @xmath34 gluino distribution .",
    "the relatively weak dependence of the gluino density on the gluino mass precludes such a large enhancement . as a crude estimate of the dependence of the gluino density on the gluino mass ,",
    "we have evolved the cteq3l parton distributions @xcite between factorization scales of 2 and 100 gev , including gluinos of various masses .",
    "for gluinos in the 2 to 10 gev mass range , we see a @xmath43 variation in the gluino density at factorization scales @xmath44 gev .",
    "this mild variation is consistent with the gluino mass - dependence found in ref .",
    "hence , one expects the cancellation between contributions found above to persist for lower gluino masses .",
    "consequently , we put an upper bound of about 16% on the expected rise in the cross section between low and high @xmath1 due to a light gluino .",
    "the cdf experiment has reported an excess for the single - jet - inclusive rate at high @xmath1 , of the order of 50% .",
    "d0 has not confirmed this excess , but it has been argued elsewhere @xcite that , when analyzed with a common theoretical calculation , the d0 data are not found to be inconsistent with that of cdf . in       -.7 cm    ( which is reproduced from ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the observed signal is seen to be gently rising above the next - to - leading - order standard model theory with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "considering that the cross section falls about seven orders of magnitude over the @xmath1 range of the plot , the agreement between qcd and the data is rather impressive . nevertheless , the high @xmath1 excess is troublesome .",
    "its interpretation is not clear because of a variety of experimental and theoretical issues  @xcite . on the theoretical side , for example , it is possible to readjust the parton distribution functions to remove the excess with only a minor penalty in @xmath45 for the global fit to data @xcite .",
    "the high @xmath1 rise in the cdf data appears to be of the order of 50% , which may be contrasted to the smaller @xmath4616% rise ( between low @xmath1 and high @xmath1 ) which we found to be due to the light gluino .",
    "thus , we conclude that a light gluino is insufficient to generate the excess observed by cdf .",
    "note also , from , that much of the increase due to a light gluino would occur in the lower energy region , which is not apparent in the cdf data shown in .",
    "unfortunately , due to the present uncertainties in both the proton s gluon distribution @xcite and the systematic experimental uncertainties in the available data , no definitive conclusion is currently possible as to the origin of the rise . with smaller uncertainties it would be possible to rule out or support the existence of a light gluino , or differentiate between other physics scenarios .",
    "it would have been desirable to use the data to put bounds on the appearance of extra light strongly interacting degrees of freedom ; however , remaining uncertainties in the latest parton distribution functions and the small size of the effect make this task problematic .",
    "one may , of course , increase the high @xmath1 end of the theoretical prediction by assuming particular higher energy scale physics @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , there is little constraint on how to go about doing this . generally , new high scale physics ( with appropriately chosen parameters )",
    "increases the cross section because new channels open .    in principle",
    "it should be possible to determine whether the high @xmath1 rise is due to low ( @xmath47 gev ) or high scale ( @xmath48 gev ) physics .",
    "low energy physics , such as modifications to the parton distributions @xcite or the addition of a light gluino , would require that the behavior of the cross section at 630 gev total center of mass energy be similar to that shown in fig .",
    "[ withgluinofigure ] for the 1.8 tev data ; essentially one need merely rescale @xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ withgluinofigure ] by 630/1800 .",
    "the origin of this simple scaling is that the parton distribution functions undergo little evolution between the energy scales of interest . although the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have cautioned against direct comparison of perturbative qcd with their @xmath49 gev data , these data have been found @xcite to agree reasonably well with the next - to - leading - order prediction .",
    "the ua2 data do not show a rise at high @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , we have investigated the effect of a light gluino on the single - jet - inclusive rate at the @xmath50 collider lhc ( @xmath51 tev ) . over the @xmath1 range 400 gev to 2 tev , and with similar cuts on the pseudorapidity of the jet , we find that the full @xmath52 ratio is a slowly decreasing function of @xmath1 . over this range in transverse energy , @xmath52 falls by roughly 7% .",
    "we have estimated the effect of a light gluino on the single - jet - inclusive production cross section measured at cdf @xcite , d0 @xcite , and ua2 @xcite .",
    "the gluino affects this cross section in three ways .",
    "firstly , the gluino slows the running of @xmath10 , making it larger at high energies .",
    "this acts to enhance the cross section relative to standard qcd .",
    "secondly , gluinos can be pair produced in @xmath53 and @xmath54 collisions , resulting in a further enhancement of the cross section .",
    "( these two contributions have very recently been discussed in ref .",
    "finally , the gluino modifies the dglap evolution of the parton densities of the proton through the introduction of new states as well as the value of @xmath10 .",
    "we have found that this last effect cancels against the first two , leaving no more than a @xmath55 enhancement between the low and high @xmath1 ends of the spectrum for the case of a 5 gev gluino .",
    "we have argued that this cancellation should persist for smaller gluino masses .",
    "the current experimental uncertainties , and the uncertainties in the parton densities @xcite , make it unlikely that single - jet - inclusive data will be useful to differentiate between the standard model and supersymmetric models with a light gluino .",
