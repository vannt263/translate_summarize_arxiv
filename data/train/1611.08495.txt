    "the coulomb interaction between charged pions and protons influences the absorption probability of pions in nuclear medium .",
    "the pion - nucleon potential changes the kinetic energy spectra , i.e. , reducing the energetic pion production .",
    "but the total pion yields weakly depend on the potential .",
    "more pronounced effect from the potential is observed for a heavier target as shown in fig .",
    "4 .            in the past decades",
    ", the double charge exchange ( dcx ) in the pion induced reactions attracts much attention , which provides the possibility to explore the multiple pion interaction in a nucleus and is involved in two or more nucleons . shown in fig .",
    "5 is the rapidity and transverse momentum distributions of pion production on the target of @xmath38ca at the incident momentum of 300 mev / c .",
    "the structure of pion production from the dcx , single charge exchange and elastic scattering is very similar in phase space .",
    "the dcx cross sections are lower and depends on isospin ingredients of target nuclei , i.e. , @xmath40 and @xmath41 being 0.22 and 0.07 for the reactions of ( @xmath42 ) and ( @xmath43 ) on @xmath38ca , respectively .",

    "the process ( @xmath42 ) can be understood via the reactions associated at least two protons , e.g. , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 . in the neutron - rich nuclei ,",
    "the process is constrained because of the larger collision probabilities between @xmath1 ( @xmath9 ) and neutrons , which leads to the decrease of the @xmath49 ratio in the pion dcx reactions .",

    "the freeze - out stage is assumed that the energy deposition is reached the equilibrium and the pions do not interact nucleons at the evolution of 300 fm / c taken in this work .",
    "the excitation energies of primary fragments are evaluated from the binding energy difference between the fragments and their ground - state ones .",
    "the de - excitation of the primary fragments leads to a broad mass distribution , in which the structure effects ( shell correction , fission barrier , particle separation energy ) contribute to the process .",
    "the phase - space distributions of fragments with charged number of @xmath522 in collisions of charged pions on @xmath38ca is calculated as shown fig .",
    "7 . it is interest that the pion - nucleon potential enhances the fragment production in the domain of high kinetic energy ( @xmath5360 mev ) , which is caused from the fact that the attractive potential increases the energy deposition , in particular for the @xmath2 induced reactions .",
    "similar conclusions are found with the heavier target @xmath44au as shown fig .",
    "8 .",
    "fragmentation of target nucleus induced by pions is associated with the pion - nucleon scattering , @xmath0 production and decay process , @xmath0-nucleon interaction etc .",

    "9 is the fragment distributions in @xmath1 and @xmath2 induced reactions on @xmath38ca at an incident momentum of 300 mev / c .",
    "it is obvious that the pion - nucleon potential has negligible contribution on the fragment formation .",
    "the average mass removals are 4.8 and 4.7 for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , which are evaluated from @xmath54 . here , the @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the mass number of target nucleus and the integration limit being @xmath57 .",

    "10 for the @xmath1 induced reactions and in fig . 11 for bombarding @xmath44au with @xmath2 at the incident energy of 100 mev , 180 mev and 300 mev , respectively .",
    "the fragment production in the target - mass region is nicely reproduced .",
    "the bump structure of intermediate mass fragments comes from the fission of heavy fragments .",
    "similar mass and charge distributions are found for both @xmath1 and @xmath2 induced reactions .",
    "emission of the intermediate mass fragments ( imfs ) is caused from the fluctuation of composite system , which has been investigated for extracting the nuclear equation of state and density dependence of symmetry energy in heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "i presented a comparison of imfs correlated to charged particle multiplicity in pion induced reactions at different incident energies as shown fig .",
    "production of the imfs appears maximum near the charged particle multiplicity of 15 .",
    "the imf production is strongly suppressed in the pion induced reactions in comparison to heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it should be noticed that the shadow of fission products dominates the imf production in the pion reactions .",
    "however , the fluctuation of nucleus - nucleus collisions leads to the multifragmentation of colliding partners in hics , which contributes the imf production .",
    "the fragmentation reactions induced by pions provide the basis in understanding the pion - nucleon interaction , energy deposition , fragment formation etc , which are helpful for investigating the hypernucleus production with the high - energy pion beams .",
    "the hypernucleus formation in pion - nucleus collisions is in progress .",
    "the fragmentation mechanism and the charge - exchange reactions in pion induced nuclear reactions have been investigated within an isospin and momentum dependent hadron - transport model ( lqmd ) .",
    "the pion - nucleon potential is of importance on the pion dynamics in the charge - exchange reactions .",
    "the isospin ratio in the pion dcx is influenced by the isospin ingredient of target nucleus .",
    "the attractive pion - nucleon potential near the @xmath0-resonance energies ( e=0.19 gev , p=0.298 gev / c ) influences the kinetic energy spectra , but has negligible contribution on the fragmentation process .",
    "the relative motion energy is deposited in the nucleus via the pion - nucleon collisions .",
    "the transferred energy weakly depends on the incident pion energy .",
