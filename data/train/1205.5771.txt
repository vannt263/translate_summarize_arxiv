    "we present results of radio continuum observations of the edge - on galaxy , ngc  4631 , using the karl g. jansky very large array ( hereafter , the expanded very large array , or evla ) in its c configuration .",
    "these are the first results from a new survey , continuum halos in nearby galaxies  an evla survey ( chang - es ) , whose motivation , science goals , galaxy sample criteria , and expectations for improvements over previous surveys are described in a companion paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , paper i ) .",
    "the sample consists of 35 nearby edge - on galaxies and observations are being carried out in two frequency bands ( 1.5 ghz and 6 ghz , i.e. in l - band and c - band , respectively ) in all polarization products .",
    "the survey includes observations in three evla array configurations ( b , c , and d ) but the test data presented here were obtained at both frequencies in the c configuration only .    in this second paper ,",
    "our goals are to outline the observations and data reduction procedures used for the test data ( sect .  [",
    "sec : n4631 ] ) and to present the initial scientific results for ngc  4631 ( sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] ) .",
    "we pay particular attention to the data reduction procedures , especially with respect to differences that are introduced by using the wide evla frequency bands that are now available .",
    "the galaxy , ngc  4631 , was chosen because of its extensive radio continuum halo which has been known for some time @xcite .",
    "for a recent summary of previous observations of this galaxy , see @xcite . in this paper , we refer to the region , @xmath3 kpc , as the disk - halo interface and use ` halo ' for emission on larger scales ( @xmath4 kpc ) . `",
    "high - latitude ' or ` extraplanar ' are also used to describe either of these components .",
    "it is worth keeping in mind that halos are not necessarily smooth since substructure is generally observed , depending on the spatial scales that are probed .",
    "observations of ngc  4631 were carried out on 11 nov .",
    "2010 with the pointing center set to the center of the galaxy at ra = 12@xmath5 42@xmath6 08@xmath701 , dec = 32@xmath8 32@xmath9 29@xmath104 the observing set - up is summarized in table  [ table : obs - n4631 ] .",
    "all evla observations ( including continuum ) are now done in spectral line mode which facilitates the excision of radio frequency interference ( rfi ) from the data , effectively enables broader uv coverage via multi - frequency synthesis techniques ( sect .",
    "[ subsec : imaging ] ) and permits the extraction of spectral index information ( sect .  [",
    "sec : spectral_index ] ) .    at the time of the observations ,",
    "the widar correlator was restricted to a maximum of 8 spectral windows ( spws ) per base - band , i.e. per ac or bd intermediate frequency ( if ) .",
    "each spectral window has its own bandpass response , and contains 64 channels . with ac and bd",
    "ifs contiguous in frequency , the result was 1024 spectral channels centered at 1.5 ghz ( l - band ) for a total bandpass of 512 mhz , and 1024 channels centered at 6.0 ghz ( c - band ) for a total bandpass of 2.048 ghz .",
    "clearly , at the lower frequency , the achievable bandwidth can not be higher than the frequency itself , but the l - band bandwidth ( more so than c - band ) also suffers from rfi , restricting the bandwidth further .",
    "in fact , although we avoided known rfi at the ends of the band , we found that the l - band rfi , especially in the 1.52 to 1.64 ghz region within our band , to be persistent throughout our observations .",
    "together with other flagging , this reduced the effective l - band bandwidth to approximately 300 mhz and has prompted a modification of the correlator set - up for subsequent observations .",
    "the strength of the rfi in l - band achieved a maximum value which was 300 times that of 3c286 ( the flux calibrator ) so that even the sidelobes of the rfi swamped that of our astronomical sources at some frequencies .",
    "experimentation with flagged and unflagged data showed that it was not , in general , possible to salvage the long - spacing uv data while flagging only the short - spacings ; once rfi was detected , all uv data had to be removed over the time and frequency ranges that were affected .",
    "rfi at c - band was also present , but much less severe than in l - band .",
    "observations were carried out in the standard fashion , including scans of a flux calibrator ( which was also used as a bandpass calibrator as well as for the determination of absolute polarization position angle ) , a ` zero - polarization ' calibrator ( to determine the instrumental polarization ) and a phase calibrator .",
    "the flux calibrator was observed in 3 independent scans at each frequency for these test observations .",
    "only a single scan is necessary , in principle , but these data were intentionally ` over - calibrated ' for consistency checks .",
    "the zero - polarization calibrator was observed once at each frequency .",
    "the l - band observation of ngc  4631 was carried out in a single time block containing one on - source scan flanked by phase calibrator scans ( plus the flux and zero - polarization calibrator )",
    ". the c - band observation of ngc  4631 with its calibrators was similarly observed in a single time block , but separated into 3 individual scans interspersed with phase calibrator scans .",
    "observations at each frequency were carried out within single blocks of total observing time in order to minimize time spent on overheads .",
    "for the regular data , however , attempts are being made , where possible , to split the observing time for given galaxy at each frequency into two observing blocks that are widely separated in hour angle ; more time is then spent on overheads but the result should be improved uv coverage with a better - behaved beam , as well as lower off - axis instrumental polarization ( sect .",
    "[ subsec : pol - cal ] ) .",
    "the data were reduced using the common astronomy software applications ( casa ) package , unless otherwise indicated . as improvements to casa are frequently being made during evla commissioning , a number of versions of casa were employed in the data reductions , in particular versions that were extant over the period may 2011 to july 2011 .",
    "the following steps were carried out for both the l - band and c - band data separately .    on - line hanning",
    "smoothing is no longer an option at the evla , so all data were first hanning smoothed to minimize gibbs ringing in frequency , a step which significantly ameliorated rfi detection throughout the band . as a result , the frequency resolution is twice the channel width , the latter listed in table  [ table : obs - n4631 ] . a significant amount of time was then spent flagging rfi .",
    "experimentation with automatic flagging routines had not yet provided results that were as dependable as manual flagging , requiring that flagging be done by hand ; however , such routines are improving and should shorten the data reduction process in the future .    the flux density , i@xmath11 , ( stokes i ) of the flux calibrator",
    ", 3c  286 , was first set for the frequency , @xmath12 , of each spectral window using a known model and the ` perley - taylor-99 ' calibration scale .",
    "since each spectral window of each antenna has its own bandpass response , bandpass calibrations were required , again using 3c  286 . however , since the data are vector - averaged when producing an average bandpass for each spectral window , it is necessary to first carry out an initial gain and phase calibration with time ; applying the solution ensures that phase variations that may occur over the different scans of 3c  286 when it is observed through different elevations do not result in decorrelation when vector - averaging occurs . with the initial gain / phase solutions applied ,",
    "bandpasses were then determined , one for each spectral window of each antenna , and the initial gain and phase solution is no longer used . the gain and phase",
    "were then calibrated with time for each of the flux , zero - polarization , and phase calibrators , where an antenna - based solution is found for each spectral window and each separate scan , followed by bootstrapping of the flux from the flux calibrator to both the zero - polarization ( oq  208 ) and phase ( j1221 + 2813 ) calibrators for each spectral window . at l - band ,",
    "the flux densities of oq  208 and j1221 + 2813 varied systematically over the band from 0.72 to 1.16 jy ( positive spectral index . ] with an error of about 0.3% on each spectral window value ) and from 0.55 to 0.53 jy ( negative spectral index with an error of about 0.7% on each spectral window value ) , respectively . at c - band ,",
    "the flux densities of the two calibrators ( in the same order ) varied from 2.4 to 1.9 jy ( negative spectral index with an error of about 0.4% on each spectral window value ) and from 0.46 to 0.44 jy ( negative spectral index with an error of about 0.5% on each spectral window value ) , respectively .",
    "the changing spectral index of oq  208 ( positive in l - band and negative in c - band ) is in good agreement with the known spectrum which peaks around 4 ghz ( * ? ? ? * or the nasa extragalactic database ) .",
    "the bandpass and gain / phase solutions as a function of time were then applied to all sources , antenna by antenna , and spectral window by spectral window , with the gain / phase solutions from the phase calibrator interpolated in time when applied to ngc  4631 .",
    "polarized intensity , p , and the polarization angle on the sky , @xmath13 , require calibration of stokes q and u. to initially set stokes q and u for 3c  286 , the absolute position angle on the sky is assumed to be constant at @xmath14 deg , but the percentage polarization varies with frequency .",
    "we obtained detailed evla data on this calibrator ( r. perley , private communication ) and fit a curve through the l - band data of the form , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the percent polarization at frequency , @xmath12 ( mhz ) . in c - band , only a linear fit was necessary , @xmath17 ( @xmath12 in mhz ) .",
    "the estimated error , including measurement errors and fitted curves is of order 0.3% .",
    "q and u were then calculated at the frequency of each spectral window via @xmath18 where the total intensity , i@xmath11 , has previously been set via a known model ( sect .",
    "[ subsec : n4631-calibration ] ) .",
    "there is leakage between the right circularly polarized ( r ) and left circularly polarized ( l ) feeds at the evla and this leakage must be determined in order to calibrate the cross - terms ( rl , lr ) from which q and u are calculated .",
    "the leakage terms ( referred to as the ` d ' terms ) were determined from the ` zero - polarization ' source , oq  208 after first applying the previously determined gain / phase and bandpass solutions .",
    "finally , the absolute polarization angle on the sky ( the r - l phase difference ) was calibrated from the known position angle of 3c  286 , after first applying solutions for gain / phase , bandpass , and d terms .",
    "all corrections were then applied to the calibrators and the source ( gain / phase , bandpass , d terms , and absolute position angle corrections ) .",
    "the polarization calibration described in this section corrects for ionospheric faraday rotation , provided that this rotation is constant with time and position in the sky .",
    "as neither may be the case , it is important to determine the magnitude of such variations . at present",
    ", there is no casa routine to do this , but there is ( the task , tecor ) in the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) .",
    "we therefore copied a small amount of l - band data from each calibrator , ensuring that all observing times were represented in the copied data set , into aips for this purpose .",
    "( corrections for the source are assumed to be the same as those for the phase calibrator , given their close proximity in the sky . )",
    "tecor derives corrections for ionospheric faraday rotation from maps of total electron content obtained from nasa s crustal dynamics data interchange system ( ccdis ) which cover the time range of the observations .",
    "these measurements provide a crude correction since the spatial resolution is typically coarser than the source size . therefore ,",
    "if significant fluctuations exist on smaller scales , we can not correct for them .    in l - band , we find that the differential ionospheric faraday rotation ranges from a minimum of 2.365 to a maximum of 2.805 rad m@xmath19 over all sources , positions , and times .",
    "this result corresponds to a variation of 0.44 rad m@xmath19 , or 0.74 deg at the high frequency end of the band and 1.45 deg at the low frequency end .",
    "thus a typical error introduced by ignoring time variable or position variable ionospheric faraday rotation is about 1 deg and we therefore have made no additional correction for faraday rotation at l - band beyond the non - differential term that has already been taken into account in the normal data reduction .",
    "moreover , since faraday rotation @xmath20 and since the l - band and c - band observations were close together in time , no additional correction was necessary in c - band either .",
    "finally , the accuracy of wide field linear polarization imaging is limited by variations in instrumental polarization as a function of angle from the pointing center ; that is , the corrections that have now been applied are accurate only for the on - axis position .",
    "the off - axis instrumental polarization for a ` snapshot ' observation ] is estimated to be less than a few percent within the half - power point of the primary beam and increases at larger angles . in this paper , our polarization results ( sect .",
    "[ sec : pol_maps ] ) are shown only over regions that are within the primary beam full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) .",
    "in addition , when sources are tracked , the source parallactic angle rotates through the primary beam , minimizing the off - axis polarization errors .",
    "hence for these data , this effect is negligible .",
    "nevertheless , for future wide - field polarization mapping , a correction will likely be required ; a casa algorithm is currently being developed to aid in this process .",
    "our goal is to form single i , q , and u maps of ngc  4631 from each of the l - band and c - band data ; maps of linear polarization intensity , p , and magnetic field position angle , @xmath13 , can then be formed from q and u. as has always been done , the uv data are first fourier transformed ( fted ) into the map plane which results in an image ( the ` dirty image ' ) which is the convolution of the ft of the antenna distribution in the uv plane ( the ` dirty beam ' ) with the source sky brightness distribution .",
    "the dirty beam is then deconvolved from the dirty image ( i.e. it is ` cleaned ' ) to find an image of the source .",
    "the clark method @xcite of separating the cleaning process into major and minor cycles , treating each stokes plane separately , was used .",
    "the broad bandwidths of the evla widar correlator , however , introduce some new imaging requirements and considerations that were , for the most part , unnecessary with the vla .",
    "these are described briefly here:_a ) _ _ bandwidth smearing : _ if the observations had not been in spectral line mode , then the broad frequency band would have introduced severe chromatic aberration into the image ; this aberration worsens with distance from the map center .",
    "however , since spectral line mode is being universally employed at the evla , bandwidth smearing is instead restricted to the spectral resolution of the data ( by using the multifrequency synthesis technique , see next section ) .",
    "for example , for our data at the center of either band and at a distance from the map center that is twice the fwhm of the primary beam , the loss in amplitude due to bandwidth smearing is only about 1.5% , or essentially negligible where most of the emission occurs._b ) _ _ multi - frequency synthesis ( mfs ) : _ the positions of the antennas in the uv plane are measured in wavelengths and those positions will vary as the frequency changes across a given band .",
    "consequently , if each spectral channel is gridded separately , there is an improvement in uv coverage over a case in which channels are averaged together .",
    "the clean algorithm employed in casa utilizes this multi - frequency synthesis technique ( * ? ? ?",
    "* also called  bandwidth synthesis)._c ) _ _ widefield imaging : _ the sensitivity of the array to emission that is far from the map center and even outside of the telescope s primary beam means that the array itself is non - coplanar to such emission .",
    "thus , the ` w term ' in the ft ( the coordinate in the line - of - sight direction towards the source ) , which can be ignored near the map center , becomes important .",
    "casa clean employs the ` w - projection algorithm ' @xcite to correct for this effect._d ) _ _ spectral index fitting : _ with wide bands , the spectral index of the source itself , which is spatially variable , needs to be fitted during imaging @xcite .",
    "in casa s clean algorithm , this is accomplished by assuming that the emission at any position can be described by , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a reference frequency within the band ( here taken to be the band center ) , i@xmath23 is the specific intensity at the reference frequency , @xmath24 is the spectral index and @xmath25 describes the spectral curvature .",
    "the function is expanded in a taylor series about @xmath22 , resulting in a polynomial fit to the spectrum .",
    "the fit includes all unflagged channels across any given band and is not done on a ` per spectral window ' basis .",
    "in addition , the fitting is done using all data so that the resulting parameters correspond to a single spatial resolution ( for example , the @xmath24 map is not formed such that the spatial resolution would vary across the band ) .",
    "@xcite outline the implementation of spectral fitting and provide examples as to how the image can improve with increasing numbers of taylor terms , @xmath26 . _",
    "e ) _ _ multi - scale clean : _ improvements have been made over the traditional clean which modeled all emission as a collection of point sources .",
    "the clean implementation in casa now allows for a multi - scale clean @xcite which assumes that the emission can be modeled as a collection of components over a variety of spatial scales .",
    "these scales are typically chosen to span the range from an angular size of ` zero ' ( corresponding to a point source , or the classic clean analogy ) to a scale of order the maximum spatial scale expected to be present in the emission .",
    "since the latter is not always known in advance , in practice , the maximum scale size is increased systematically until no more flux is actually cleaned out in that largest scale . for details of the casa implementation of the combined multi - scale , multi - frequency synthesis ( ms - mfs ) clean , see @xcite . _",
    "f ) _ _ primary beam : _ the primary beam ( pb ) varies from one end of the band to the other and , as a result , nowhere in the field of view is there a ` null ' as there would be for a monochromatic primary beam @xcite .",
    "consequently , it is the frequency - averaged pb ( pb@xmath27 ) that the final cleaned image must be corrected for .",
    "moreover , since the frequency dependence of the pb imposes its own spectral index across the field of view , all spectral index maps ( sect .",
    "[ sec : spectral_index ] ) must be corrected for this effect as well .",
    "ngc  4631 was mapped taking into account all of the above points . at both bands ,",
    "a very wide field was first mapped ( 3 degrees for l - band , or 6 times the primary beam fwhm ; 34.1 arcmin for c - band or 4.6 times the primary beam ) to determine how large an image needed to be mapped to include all sources of significant flux in the clean .",
    "smaller fields were then mapped completely , as required . for the multi - scale clean , we used typically 4 to 6 equally - spaced spatial scales , the first one always corresponding to point sources as in the classic clean .",
    "for example , at l - band , scales up to 4.2 arcmin were employed , where the largest scale was chosen according to the considerations of point _",
    "e ) _ above .",
    "we also self - calibrated each data set once , finding that a single amplitude + phase self - calibration resulted in a small improvement in the rms map noise .",
    "after extensive experimentation , we adopted 3 sets of parameters representing 3 different spatial resolutions for each frequency and display them , along with some ancillary data , in figs .",
    "[ fig : l - band ] and [ fig : c - band ] ; the corresponding map parameters are given in table  [ table : map - n4631 ] .",
    "the theoretical noise values for these observations ( including confusion estimates ) are 18 and 3.7 @xmath0jy beam@xmath1 at l - band and c - band , respectively .",
    "our lowest rms noise values are only 1.6 and 1.3 times higher for the total intensity images .",
    "there are , however , several residual linear cleaning artifacts in the l - band images that are visible immediately to the east and west of the galaxy s disk ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : l - band]c in particular ) .",
    "the conclusions that we present in this paper are not affected by these artifacts . the disconnected emission seen approximately 2 arcmin above and below the plane in fig .",
    "[ fig : c - band]c is likely real and part of the halo ; missing low - order spacings contribute to the well - known appearance of the galaxy s disk emission sitting on a negative bowl .    note that , as is usually done , all displayed total intensity images are not corrected for the primary beam in order to show images with uniform noise .",
    "when numerical results are given , however , the results have been corrected for the frequency - averaged primary beam ( pb@xmath27 ) .",
    "note also , that we carried out some subsequent analysis using aips .",
    "stokes q and u maps were formed with the same sets of parameters as the total intensity images , except that fewer spatial scales were required during cleaning , given the weaker emission in these maps . the relevant parameters for these images are given in table  [ table : map - n4631 ] . in principle",
    ", the rms noise on the q and u maps should be the same as the i map ; however , the lower signal in the cross - hands means that residual errors associated with cleaning the high intensity emission are no longer present . at l - band ,",
    "our lowest rms noise is 1.2 times the theoretical value and at c - band , our lowest noise matches the theoretical value .",
    "note that , in order to obtain sufficient signal - to - noise ( s / n ) in the polarized emission , all spectral windows were used .",

    "this correction is good to zeroth order , but does not take into account first order effects which would result from differences between the right and left circularly polarized pbs .",
    "first order corrections are not yet implemented in casa but we expect them to be small for this data set .",
    "for example , if the difference between the right and left circularly polarized pb voltage response is of order 10% at a distance from the map center corresponding to 30% of the primary beam ( 17.4 arcmin and 4.6 arcmin at l - band and c - band , respectively ) , then the error in q or u would be 3% of the q or u intensity at that point .",
    "pb corrections of the linearly polarized intensity maps shown in fig .",

    "our observations ( see table  [ table : obs - n4631 ] ) are intermediate between a snapshot and full synthesis .",
    "consequently , the spatial scales quoted in the text are likely upper limits . ] .",
    "the halo of ngc  4631 at both bands has previously been observed to extend to approximately 12 arcmin ( see , for example , fig .",
    "9 of @xcite and fig .",
    "3 of @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore clear that not all flux has been detected at c - band and , as fig .",
    "[ fig : l - band ] illustrates , the broadest scale halo emission has not been detected at l - band either .",
    "future d - array observations , with additional shorter spacings , should remedy this situation at l - band .    using previously published total flux estimates , we can normally quantify the amount of flux that has been missed in our observations .",
    "however , at c - band , a wide range of 4.85 ghz fluxes have been reported , likely reflecting similar problems with spatial scales , for example , @xmath32 mjy , 243 mjy ( see ned ) and 480 mjy @xcite .",
    "our primary - beam - corrected flux in c - band is @xmath33 mjy . using the average global spectral index of @xcite , @xmath34",
    ", our frequency - adjusted flux would be @xmath35 mjy , indicating that there is significant flux missing from the c - band maps .",

    "[ fig : l - band]a ) for a straight spectral index assumption ( a ) and then allowing for curvature within the band ( b ) .",
    "the `` mottled '' appearance of the two maps is due in part to the fact that point - to - point variations are significant .",

    "our measured @xmath24 will not be affected provided the broad scale emission has the same spectral index as the disk and contributes a constant intensity at each position .",
    "it is known , however , that the halo spectral index , which we associate with the broad scale emission , is steeper than that of the disk .",
    "a variety of measurements have been made over different frequency ranges , but typically , off - major - axis values fall in the range , @xmath45 ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    taking the extreme case of @xmath46",
    ", we can determine how the addition of a ` plateau ' of emission of this spectral index to our data would affect our measured values of @xmath24 .",
    "if the halo emission occupies an emission ellipse of major @xmath47 minor axis extent , approximately 15 arcmin @xmath47 12 arcmin @xcite , then the emission region of fig .",

    "[ fig : l - band]a to this area , assuming that the broad scale flux uniformly fills the emission ellipse , then the missing emission corresponds to a plateau of 0.12 mjy beam@xmath1 , on average , over the disk at the central frequency .    using the measured average intensity from fig .",
    "[ fig : l - band]a over the same region as the spectral index ( taking @xmath48 ) the addition of such a steep spectral index plateau would adjust our measurement of @xmath24 from -0.84 to -0.88 ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "this is a worst - case scenario unless there are missing spatial scales that are _ smaller _ than 11 arcmin ( the major axis size ) .",

    "the curvature , @xmath52 , averaged over the emission regions for these two resolutions is @xmath53 in both cases , agreeing to within @xmath54 with the result at high resolution .",
    "if we consider fitting errors , possible errors from missing flux , and variations between the different uv weightings , our average spectral index is @xmath55 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , it is worth stressing that the wide bands used here allow for considerable flexibility in ` tuning ' the spatial resolution of the array by appropriate use of uv weighting .",
    "this means that the spatial resolutions of l - band and c - band data can actually be matched exactly , even with observations in only a single array configuration .",
    "therefore spectral index maps can also be made between l and c - bands from observations in a single array configuration .",
    "although we formed such maps for ngc  4631 , we defer the results until all missing c - band flux is recovered through additional observations ( paper i ) .",
    "these new evla observations , even though they were obtained during a limited test run in a single array configuration ( table  [ table : obs - n4631 ] ) , have revealed a number of new features not before seen in ngc  4631 . in this section ,",

    "a close relationship has been found between radio continuum and x - ray emission in the outflow of ngc  253 as well @xcite .",

    "extra - planar polarized emission both to the north - east and north - west of the galaxy s center agrees in general with the image of @xcite at 5 ghz .",

    "the average spectral index is @xmath67 = - 0.84 @xmath65 0.05 ( sect .",

    "<S> we present the first results from the chang - es survey , a new survey of 35 edge - on galaxies to search for both in - disk as well as extra - planar radio continuum emission . </S>",
    "<S> chang - es is exploiting the new wide - band , multi - channel capabilities of the karl g. jansky very large array ( i.e. the expanded very large array , or evla ) with observations in two bands centered at 1.5 and 6 ghz in a variety of array configurations with full polarization . </S>",
    "<S> the motivation and science case for the survey are presented in a companion paper ( paper i ) . </S>",
    "<S> these first results are based on c - array test observations in both observing bands of the well - known radio halo galaxy , ngc  4631 . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we outline the observations and the data reduction steps that are required for wide - band calibration and mapping of evla data , including polarization .    </S>",
    "<S> with modest on - source observing times ( 30 minutes at 1.5 ghz and 75 minutes at 6 ghz for the test data ) we have achieved best rms noise levels of 22 and 3.5 @xmath0jy beam@xmath1 at 1.5 ghz and 6 ghz , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> new disk - halo features have been detected , among them two at 1.5 ghz that appear as loops in projection .    </S>",
    "<S> we present the first 1.5 ghz spectral index map of ngc  4631 to be formed from a single wide - band observation in a single array configuration . </S>",
    "<S> this map represents tangent slopes to the intensities within the band centered at 1.5 ghz , rather than fits across widely separated frequencies as has been done in the past and is also the highest spatial resolution spectral index map yet presented for this galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the average spectral index in the disk is @xmath2 indicating that the emission is largely non - thermal , but a small global thermal contribution is sufficient to explain a positive curvature term in the spectral index over the band . </S>",
    "<S> two specific star forming regions have spectral indices that are consistent with thermal emission .    </S>",
    "<S> polarization results ( uncorrected for internal faraday rotation ) are consistent with previous observations and also reveal some new features . on broad scales , </S>",
    "<S> we find strong support for the notion that magnetic fields constrain the x - ray emitting hot gas . </S>"
