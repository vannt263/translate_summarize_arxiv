    "among other things , the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) is a superlative top factory , producing about 90 million top - quark pairs per year of running at design energy @xmath7  tev and design luminosity @xmath8  @xmath9s@xmath10 in each of the four experiments @xcite .",
    "this will allow us to determine the properties of the top quark , such as its mass @xmath11 , total decay width @xmath12 , branching fractions , and elements @xmath13 of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) @xcite quark mixing matrix , with unprecedented precision .",
    "due to its large mass , the top quark decays so rapidly that it has no time to hadronize and passes on its full spin information to its decay products .",
    "if it were not for the confinement of color , the top quark could , therefore , be considered as a free particle . due to @xmath14 , top quarks almost exclusively decay to bottom quarks , via @xmath15 .    on the other hand ,",
    "bottom quarks hadronize , via @xmath16 , before they decay , so that the decay process @xmath17 is of prime importance , and it is an urgent task to predict its partial decay width as realistically and reliably as possible .",
    "of particular interest are the distribution in the scaled @xmath1-hadron energy @xmath0 in the top - quark rest frame , and , in the case of leptonic @xmath6-boson decays @xmath18 , the one in the charged - lepton decay angle @xmath5 in the @xmath6-boson rest frame .",
    "in fact , the @xmath0 distribution provides direct access to the @xmath1-hadron fragmentation functions ( ffs ) , and the @xmath19 distribution allows us to analyze the @xmath6-boson polarization and so to further constrain the @xmath1-hadron ffs by exploiting @xmath0 distributions for all the @xmath6-boson polarization states .",
    "@xmath1 mesons are , for instance , cleanly identified by their decays to @xmath20 mesons , which are easy to tag through their spectacular decays to @xmath2 and @xmath21 pairs .",
    "the theoretical aspects of top - quark physics at the lhc are nicely summarized in a recent review paper @xcite . in the approximation of treating the bottom quark as a stable final - state particle that does not hadronize , the qcd corrections to @xmath22",
    "are known at nlo with subsequent @xmath18 decay @xcite and at next - to - next - to - leading order for stable @xmath6 boson @xcite .",
    "the terms of order @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the first coefficient of the qcd beta function and @xmath25 is the strong - coupling constant , were resummed to all orders in ref .",
    "the nlo electroweak corrections were found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the hadronization of the bottom quark was considered in the nlo qcd analyses of top - quark decay in refs .",
    "@xcite and was , in fact , identified to be the largest source of uncertainty in the determination of the top - quark mass . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath6 boson was taken to be stable , the bottom - quark mass was neglected at the parton level , and the hadronization process @xmath16 was implemented as a convolution of a perturbative ff @xcite , describing in a way the conversion of the massless bottom quark to its massive counterpart , and a nonperturbative ff modeling the hadronization of the latter .",
    "hereby , the perturbative ff depends on a factorization scale and is subject to dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) @xcite evolution , while the nonperturbative ff is scale independent . because of the treatment of a heavy quark as a massless parton , this framework corresponds to the zero - mass variable - flavor - number ( zm - vfn ) scheme . in refs .",
    "@xcite , also soft - gluon resummation was studied . in ref .",
    "@xcite , also the distribution in the invariant mass @xmath26 of the @xmath1 hadron and the charged lepton @xmath27 from @xmath6-boson decay was considered .    in this paper , we revisit @xmath1-hadron production from top - quark decay working at nlo in the general - mass variable - flavor - number ( gm - vfn ) scheme , which was elaborated for inclusive heavy - flavored - hadron production in @xmath2 annihilation @xcite , two - photon collisions @xcite , photoproduction @xcite , and hadroproduction @xcite , and provides an ideal theoretical framework also here .",
    "being manifestly based on collin s hard - scattering factorization theorem appropriate for massive quarks @xcite , this factorization scheme allows one to resum the large logarithms in @xmath28 , to retain the finite-@xmath28 effects , and to preserve the universality of the ffs , whose scaling violations remain to be subject to dglap evolution .",
    "in this way , it combines the virtues of the zm - vfn and fixed - flavor - number ( ffn ) schemes and , at the same time , avoids their flaws .",
    "it is , in fact , a tailor - made tool for global analyses of experimental data on the inclusive production of heavy - flavored hadrons , allowing one to transfer nonperturbative information on the hadronization of quarks and gluons from one type of experiment to another and , within one type of experiment , from one energy scale @xmath29 to another , without the restriction @xmath30 inherent to the zm - vfn scheme . in the gm - vfn scheme ,",
    "the perturbative ffs enter the formalism via subtraction terms for the hard - scattering cross sections and decay rates , so that the actual ffs are truly nonperturbative and may be assumed to have some smooth forms that can be determined through global data fits .",
    "in contrast to the ffn scheme , the gm - vfn scheme also accommodates ffs for gluons and light quarks , as in the zm - vfn scheme .",
    "specifically , our analysis is supposed to enhance those of refs .",
    "@xcite by retaining all nonlogarithmic @xmath28 terms of the result in the ffn scheme and by including light - parton fragmentation .",
    "furthermore , we include finite-@xmath31 effects , which modify the relations between partonic and hadronic variables and reduce the available phase space .",
    "although these additional effects are not expected to be truly sizable numerically , except for certain corners the phase space , their study is nevertheless mandatory in order to fully exploit the enormous statistics of the lhc data to be taken in the long run for a high - precision determination of the top - quark properties .",
    "we also extend refs .",

    "<S> we study the scaled - energy ( @xmath0 ) distribution of bottom - flavored hadrons ( @xmath1 ) inclusively produced in top - quark decays at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in the general - mass variable - flavor - number scheme endowed with realistic , nonperturbative fragmentation functions that are obtained through a global fit to @xmath2 data from cern lep1 and slac slc exploiting their universality and scaling violations . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we study the effects of gluon fragmentation and finite bottom - quark and @xmath1-hadron masses . </S>",
    "<S> we find the nlo corrections to be significant . </S>",
    "<S> gluon fragmentation leads to an appreciable reduction in the partial decay width at low values of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> hadron masses are responsible for the low-@xmath0 threshold , while the bottom - quark mass is of minor importance . neglecting the latter </S>",
    "<S> , we also study the doubly differential distribution @xmath3 of the partial width of the decay @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the decay angle of the charged lepton in the @xmath6-boson rest frame .    </S>",
