    "the lattice of all permutations @xmath9 on an @xmath7-element chain , also known as the permutohedron , even if widely known and studied in combinatorics , is a relatively young object of study from a pure lattice theoretic perspective .",
    "its elements , the permutations of  @xmath7 elements , are endowed with the weak bruhat order ; this order turns out to be a lattice .",

    "@xcite , hetyei and krattenthaler  @xcite ) , from language theory ( flath  @xcite , bennett and birkhoff  @xcite ) .    in the present paper , we shall focus on one of the most noteworthy features  at least from the lattice - theoretical viewpoint  of one of the equivalent constructions of the permutohedron , namely that it can be realized as the lattice of all _ clopen _ ( i.e. , both closed and open ) subsets of a certain _ strict ordering _ relation ( viewed as a set of ordered pairs ) , endowed with the operation of transitive closure .",
    "it turns out that most of the theory can be done for the transitive closure operator on the pairs of a given _ transitive _ binary relation  @xmath0 . while , unlike the situation for ordinary permutohedra , the poset  @xmath3 of all clopen subsets of  @xmath0 may not be a lattice , it is contained in the larger lattice  @xmath2 of all so - called _ regular closed _ subsets of  @xmath0 , which we shall call the _ extended permutohedron on  @xmath0 _ ( cf .",
    "section  [ s : regcl ] ) . as @xmath2 is endowed with a natural orthocomplementation @xmath10 ( cf .",

    "ortholattice_. the natural question , whether @xmath3 is a lattice , finds a natural answer in theorem  [ t : sqfree ] , where we prove that this is equivalent to the preordering associated with  @xmath0 be _ square - free _ , thus extending ( with completely different proofs ) known results for both the case of strict orderings ( pouzet _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) and the case of full relations ( hetyei and krattenthaler  @xcite ) .    however , while most earlier references deal with clopen subsets , our present paper focuses on the extended permutohedron  @xmath2 .",
    "one of our most noteworthy results is the characterization , obtained in theorem  [ t : regesd ] , of all finite transitive relations  @xmath0 such that  @xmath2 is _ semidistributive_.",
    "it turns out that this condition is equivalent to  @xmath2 being _ pseudocomplemented _ , also to  @xmath2 being a _ bounded homomorphic image of a free lattice _ , and can also be expressed in terms of forbidden sub - configurations of  @xmath0 .",
    "this result is achieved _ via _ a precise description , obtained in section  [ s : cjiregp ] , of all completely join - irreducible  elements of  @xmath2 .",
    "this is a key technical point of the present paper .",
    "this description is further extended to a description of the join - dependency relation ( cf .",
    "section  [ s : joindep ] ) , thus essentially completing the list of tools for proving one direction of theorem  [ t : regesd ] .",
    "the other directions are achieved _ via ad hoc _ constructions , such as the one of proposition  [ p : nonpseudo ] .",
    "another noteworthy consequence of our description of completely join - irreducible  elements of the lattice  @xmath2 is the _ spatiality _ of that lattice : every element is a join of completely join - irreducible  elements   and even more can be said ( cf .",

    "as a further application of our methods , we determine here the minimal subdirect decomposition of the lattice  @xmath6 of all bipartitions ( i.e. , those transitive binary relations with transitive complement ) of an @xmath7-element set , thus solving the `` equation '' @xmath12 and in fact , more generally , @xmath13 the lattices  @xmath14 solving the `` equation '' , denoted here in the form @xmath15 ( cf .",
    "section  [ s : subdbip ] ) , offer features quite different from those of the cambrian lattices ; in particular , they are not sublattices of the corresponding bipartition lattice  @xmath6 , and their cardinality does not depend on  @xmath7 alone .",
