    "recently ,  theoretical @xcite-@xcite and experimental  @xcite,@xcite-@xcite attention has been focused on spatiotemporal instabilities in one - dimensional reactive flows .  among these pattern - forming instabilities",
    "are the differential flow ( difi)@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , turing@xcite@xcite , and the physically distinct flow - distributed oscillation ( fdo)@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite mechanisms .",
    "two of these , difi and fdo , necessarily involve a flow , while turing and difi necessarily involve the differential transport of activator and inhibitor species .",
    "instabilities in a flowing medium may be absolute or convective.@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .  in the first case",
    ", a localized disturbance grows with time and spreads both upstream and downstream .  in the convective case ,",
    "on the other hand ,  a localized disturbance can not propagate upstream , and so the effect of a temporary localized perturbation is eventually washed downstream and out of the system if there is a downstream boundary .",
    "however , persistent disturbances upstream can have a large effect on the downstream behavior .",
    "this leads to the possibility of noise - sustained structures@xcite@xcite or patterns which are controlled primarily by the _ upstream _ boundary conditions .",
    "we are insterested here in this latter case , where the upstream boundary is crucial to the control of the pattern .",
    "fdo is a convective mechanism of pattern formation whereby an open flow maps the temporal dynamics of an oscillating medium , whose phase is set at the upstream boundary , onto space .  in the limit of vanishing diffusion , the resulting stationary@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , travelling@xcite@xcite@xcite and",
    "pulsating@xcite@xcite waves are simple kinematic phase waves@xcite , making fdo conceptually the simplest of the pattern - forming mechanisms , although it was discovered later than the others .",
    "the turing instability , by contrast , was initially conceived of as an absolute instability of a stationary reaction - diffusion medium .  in a flow system , however , turing @xcite and difi @xcite patterns can also be generated and controlled by means of the upstream boundary condition under convectively unstable conditions .     since an open flow with a fixed upstream boundary is equivalent , via a galilean transformation , to a stationary medium with a moving boundary@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , the physical ideas of fdo and other boundary - driven convective instabilities are also applicable to growing media .  in developmental biology",
    "an fdo mechanism driven by an oscillator or `` segmentation clock ''  at the growing tip of an embryo leads to the formation of somites @xcite ,  the precursors of vertebrae and body segments during early embryogenesis@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite ( the best - studied examples are chick and mouse . ) . quite generally , the issue of pattern formation on a growing domain is vitally important to developmental biology.@xcite  recent laboratory experiments @xcite@xcite@xcite in turing or hopf unstable media also make use of a moving boundary that mimics a flow .",
    "by contrast , a packed bed reactor ( pbr ) is a flow reactor in which the inlet , not the medium , is fixed in the laboratory frame of reference .  in the experiments of @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite the reactor",
    "is fed by the outlet of a continuous stirred tank reactor ( cstr ) which can be made to oscillate , generating travelling waves in the pbr - tube , or remain at a fixed point , leading to stationary waves .",
    "an extensive comparison of the parameter ranges for the production of stationary waves by means of various instabilities was made by satnoianu et al.@xcite , who suggested that all of these waves be viewed as variants of a general mechanism called `` flow and diffusion- distributed structures ''  ( fds ) .  in reference",
    "@xcite ,  travelling waves and combinations of differential flow and diffusion were also considered .",
    "travelling waves were refered to as difi  waves while stationary waves were referred to as fds .     our goal is to clarify the relationships among the convectively driven fdo and differential transport ( turing and difi ) modes in an open flow .",
    "we develop a general linear stability analysis for convective modes driven by boundary perturbations .",
    "we illustrate the relationships visually by plotting solutions of the dispersion  relations .",
    "our approach differs from that of @xcite and @xcite in several ways .",
    "first , we choose to focus on patterns driven convectively by the upstream boundary condition , distinguishing them from absolute instabilities .",
    "we do this because the possibility of convective instability embodies much of the new behavior that is possible with a flow ( or growth ) as opposed to a stationary medium .",
    "accordingly , we treat the dispersion relation for small disturbances differently ,  taking the real frequency , set by the boundary condition , as the independent variable and examining the _ spatial _ behavior of the resulting disturbance rather than examining the temporal behavior of an imposed spatial perturbation .",
    "we consider a mode unstable if it grows with downstream _ distance _ in response to a constant or periodic driving at the boundary .",
    "this approach resembles that of @xcite and @xcite .     within this approach",
    "we find it useful to distinguish wave modes not by whether they are stationary or travelling as in @xcite but by other criteria including the phase velocity and the relative phase between oscillations of the activator and inhibitor .",
    "we find that the fdo and difi  mechanisms are closely related to each other , both being related to an underlying hopf instability , while the turing mechanism gives rise to a distinct set of modes .",
    "the two sets of modes are apparent as two distinct peaks in the spatial growth rate at different perturbation frequencies .",
    "the difi / fdo modes can be either travelling or stationary , while turing modes are stationary only in the case of zero flow velocity .",
    "in the zero - flow case ( the original case in which the turing mechanism was considered ) , the instability is absolute and therefore not controlled by the boundary .",
    "however , it has been observed that turing patterns can be generated in a system with nonzero flow @xcite@xcite@xcite in which case they are advected along with the flow , i.e. , stationary in the co - moving frame .  in this case",
    "the instability can be convective and a turing mode with a particular wavelength can be selected by imposing a periodic perturbation at the inflow .",
    "we find that in the presence of simultaneous differential flow and differential diffusion ( relevant to the packed - bed reactor )  some of the distinguishing features of turing modes are modified , but the essential picture of two separate peaks remains unchanged .     at the end of the paper",
    ", we describe some nonlinear simulations which help to illustrate some of the linear results and relationships we describe .",
    "we find that the linear results give a rather good insight into the nature of the fully nonlinear solutions , at least in the case where the nonlinearity is not very strong .",
    "we consider the reaction - diffusion - advection  ( rda ) equations describing the transport and chemical kinetics of an activator and an inhibitor species .",
    "the chemical medium is defined by the local  or batch reactor dynamics together with transport terms .",
    "we wish to consider several forms of differential transport , so we allow each species to have its own flow velocity and diffusion coefficient .",
    "the rda equations are :  @xmath0 our aim is to analyze the pattern - forming instabilities , so we shall assume that the local kinetics has a stable or unstable fixed point , and linearize the equations for small perturbations of the uniform fixed point state .  for convenience",
    ", we shall use units in which the flow velocity of species b is unity .",
    "linearizing near the fixed point @xmath1 , transforming the units to ones where @xmath2 and defining the velocity and diffusion ratios @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively , and @xmath5 gives :  @xmath6 where the matrix @xmath7 is the jacobian of the local kinetic system evaluated at the fixed point and @xmath8 , @xmath9 are the perturbations .  a complex exponential solution@xmath10 represents a travelling wave in which the concentrations of both species oscillate .",
    "is that of @xcite ,  chosen for later convenience .",
    "@xmath11 represents the spatial growth rate , while -@xmath12 is the inverse wavelength or real  wavenumber .  ]",
    "the relative amplitude and phase are determined by the complex amplitudes @xmath13 and @xmath14  ( a real solution is formed from ( [ complexexp ] ) and its complex conjugate . )  substitution into ( [ rdalin ] ) gives@xmath15 which can be combined to give the dispersion relation@xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are respectively the trace and determinant of the jacobian .",
    "two particular cases of differential transport were studied in previous work .",
    "the case @xmath19 @xmath20 is relevant to @xcite , in which there is differential diffusion due to the immobilization of one of the species , but the flow velocities are the same , since it is actually the boundary that moves relative to the medium .  on the other hand , satnoianu et al.@xcite  considered the case @xmath21  which may be a good approximation in a flow system when one of the species is immobilized and the other moves freely .",
    "the pure fdo case @xmath22 has no differential transport . with the appropriate changes of variables and restrictions on the transport ratios",
    ",  the above dispersion relation reduces to the ones given in the previous references @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite for particular cases .",
    "we wish to consider more general forms of differential transport , for both theoretical and experimental reasons .",
    "first , varying the two transport ratios independently allows a fuller understanding of the effects of the two types of differential transport and their interaction .",
    "second , we wish to allow the possibility of experiments in which the transport coefficients are related in ways other than those previously considered .",
    "we wish to analyze the steady - state  response of the system to a sinusoidal forcing of the inflow boundary at a constant amplitude .  in general , in the linear approximation , this gives rise to a travelling wave with a complex wave number .",
    "the frequency @xmath23 will be taken to be purely real , reflecting the constant amplitude of the forcing .  however , the convective dynamics of the medium may cause the disturbance to grow or damp with the downstream distance , so that @xmath24 may be complex .  thus , we consider the real @xmath23 as an independent variable and solve the dispersion relation numerically for the complex @xmath24 .",
    "the dispersion relation is quartic in @xmath24 and so has in general four solutions .",
    "each is associated with an eigenvector @xmath25  which can be found by substituting the solution @xmath24 back into ( [ doubledisp ] ) .  in this way we can find @xmath26 and @xmath27  the ratio @xmath28 ,  which in general is complex , gives information about the relative amplitude and phase of oscillations in the two species ( an example is discussed below )",
    "we will see that in general the four solutions comprise two pairs ,  of which only one pair is relevant to the system s behavior near the upstream boundary .",
    "the two solutions of a pair together give one physical oscillation mode with an arbitrary phase .       to illustrate the physical meaning of the dispersion relation , we consider first the simplest case of pure fdo , in which @xmath30  it can easily be verified that in this case the dispersion relation ( [ dispersion ] ) relation does not depend on the jacobian matrix elements separately , but only on the trace and determinant .  the pair of equations ( [ doubledisp ] )",
    "can then be diagonalized completely by changing coordinates to the eigenbasis of the jacobian , and the quartic dispersion relation factorizes into two quadratic ones as derived in @xcite , one for each eigenvector .",
    "the quadratic dispersion relations depend on the jacobian eigenvalues , which are given by @xmath31  and are complex conjugates  if @xmath32 .  for the sake of simplicity we consider the particular case with @xmath33 whose eigenvalues and eigenvectors are @xmath34 and @xmath35  in general",
    ", the relative amplitude of the two components is complex for an oscillatory system , indicating a phase difference between the the two components .  in this particular case , the phase difference is @xmath36 .",
    "a plot of the four solutions @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) then has the form shown in figure [ purefdo ] .",
    "there are two solutions associated with each of the two eigenvectors ,  of which one has a much larger real component .",
    "both solutions are necessary in order to satisfy a boundary value problem in which boundary conditions are specified at @xmath39 and at some downstream point @xmath40",
    ".  however ,  it has been argued@xcite that for quite general boundary conditions at a far - away downstream boundary ,  it is the solution with the _ less _ positive growth rate that predominates near the upstream boundary ( @xmath41 ) .  as an example ,  consider adjusting the coefficients @xmath42 and @xmath43 in the general solution @xmath44 ( with @xmath45 ) so as to satisfy either dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions at @xmath40 .  in either of these cases , @xmath43 is smaller than @xmath42 by a factor of order @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , when there is a clear separation between the pairs of solutions , the one with lower growth rate dominates everywhere but close to the downstream boundary , which we take to be far away compared to the growth or damping length scales@xmath47(@xmath48 ) .",
    "we therefore focus attention on the lower solutions with smaller growth rates .",
    "these two solutions are associated with the two eigenvectors of the jacobian , so we may label them @xmath49 .",
    "they are complex conjugate mirror images of each other under reflection through the vertical axis ( @xmath50 )  and represent the same physical wave solution , namely@xmath51 = \\operatorname{re}\\left [   e^{-i\\omega t}e^{k_{-}x}\\mathbf{u}_{-}\\right ]   = % \\begin{pmatrix } \\cos(\\omega t+\\operatorname{im}k_{+}x)\\\\ \\sin(\\omega t+\\operatorname{im}k_{+}x ) \\end{pmatrix } e^{(\\operatorname{re}k_{+})x}.\\label{physicalsolution}%\\ ] ] because of this reflection symmetery , it will be convenient in the remainder of the paper to plot only one solution , with the understanding that the reflected complex conjugate is also present .",
    "figure [ purefdo ] shows the growth rates and wave numbers for all four solutions .",
    "note that :  1 ) @xmath12 has a zero at the natural frequency @xmath52 .",
    "when @xmath12=0 , the phase velocity@xmath53 has a corresponding pole , as will be seen in figures [ difi1]-[difituring ] .",
    "disturbances at precisely the natural frequency result in growing uniform oscillations of the medium ( this is essentially the batch hopf mode ) while perturbations faster or slower than @xmath54 give downstream or upstream travelling waves , respectively @xcite@xcite .",
    "stationary waves occur for @xmath55 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the sharpness of the growth rate peak depends on the dimensionless quantity @xmath56 .",
    "increasing the value of @xmath57  ( or , equivalently , reducing the flow velocity )  makes the peak sharper and narrower and reduces the gap between the upper and lower solutions , until , at the threshold of absolute instability , the growth rate curve develops a cusp and the upper and lower solutions cross .  when the growth rate curves of the two solutions cross , it is no longer correct to view the solution in the bulk as being determined primarily by the upstream boundary condition it is also strongly influenced by downstream conditions .",
    "this is the signature of an absolute rather than a convective instability .",
    "the peak of the growth rate occurs precisely at the frequency defined by the imaginary part of the jacobian eigenvalue .  if the fixed point is not hopf unstable but instead has eigenvalues @xmath58 with @xmath59 , then the picture is qualitatively the same , except that the peak remains below the horizontal axis .",
    "thus all perturbations are damped in this case ,  but the most slowly damped ones are at the natural frequency .",
    "the pure fdo case can be viewed as a baseline  for the physical interpretation of the dispersion relations and their solution curves in the presence of differential transport .",
    "differential transport will modify the shapes of the curves , and will make the eigenvectors @xmath23-dependent and no longer coincident with those of the jacobian",
    ".     finally , note that in the case when the fixed point is an unstable node rather than a focus , the jacobian has distinct real eigenvalues and eigenvectors instead of complex conjugate pairs .",
    "peak growth rates for the modes along both eigenvectors then occur at @xmath60@xcite  the above results are qualitatively universal for any system with a hopf instability .",
    "[ ptb ]    purefdo.eps      with the pure fdo case as a comparison , we now examine the effects of differential transport and the convective , boundary driven manifestations of difi and turing instabilities .",
    "typical results are shown in figs .",
    "[ difi1]-[difituring2 ] using the fitzhugh - nagumo - like @xcite ( fn ) model ( [ fneqns]-[fnjac ] ) for the local dynamics .",
    "the key features of the relevant solutions in the fdo case are that @xmath61 has a growth peak and the associated phase velocity has a pole at positive @xmath23 , while @xmath62 has a peak and pole on the opposite side , @xmath63 .",
    "a brief summary of the effects of differential transport on the dispersion relation solutions is as follows :     \\1 .",
    "the primary effect of differential flow is to displace and distort the positive-@xmath23 peak of @xmath64(and its mirror image in @xmath62 ) .",
    "depending on the details of the model , the peak may be shifted to the left , right , upward or downward .",
    "the pole in the phase velocity may also be shifted left or right .",
    "if sufficiently strong ,  differential flow can raise the peak growth rate from negative to positive , thus giving an instability even for a stable fixed point .",
    "this is precisely what happens in difi .  for @xmath65",
    ",  the peak growth rate may occur quite far from the pole of the phase velocity ; thus the strongest instability is to a travelling wave solution rather than to a uniform oscillation .",
    "the most important effect of differential diffusion in the absence of differential flow ( @xmath66 ) is to alter the shape of the negative-@xmath23 tail of the @xmath61 solution ( or , equivalently , the positive tail of @xmath62 ) .  for fast inhibitor diffusion ( @xmath67 ) the negative tail can develop first an inflection point and then a second growth rate peak .",
    "the modes within this second peak are distinguished by the following features , confirming their interpretation as turing patterns imposed by the boundary condition and advected with the flow :  a )  their phase velocities are all very close to unity ( in units where the flow velocity is 1 ) showing that they are stationary in the comoving frame .",
    "b )  the amplitude ratio @xmath68 from the associated eigenvector is almost purely real , meaning that , contrary to the situation in self - sustained oscillations ,  there is no phase lag between the two species ( the activator and inhibitor are almost exactly in phase or @xmath69 out of phase ) .",
    "for the most general case of differential transport , then , the dispersion relation has either one or two peaks , which we can identify as hopf / fdo / difi and turing peaks respectively .",
    "changing @xmath70 can alter the shape of the fdo peak and conversely , @xmath71 can alter the turing peak , but they generally retain a separate identity , and for the most part exist in a see - saw  relation",
    ".     we now illustrate these statements using examples based on particular models for the form of the jacobian .",
    "the examples we present in figures [ difi1]-[difituring2 ] and the nonlinear simulations used a form of the fitzhugh - nagumo ( fn ) model@xcite ,  for which the local dynamics is given by @xmath72 and the jacobian is @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a control parameter .",
    "@xmath42 and @xmath43 play the roles of activator and inhibitor , respectively .",
    "a hopf bifurcation occurs at @xmath75 ;  the fixed point is unstable for @xmath76 .",
    "we also studied another model using the simpler jacobian@xmath77 with control parameter @xmath78 and hopf instability for @xmath79 ,  hereafter referred to as the @xmath78-model .  for the @xmath78-model with @xmath79 ,",
    "both species are autocatalytic , but one inhibits the other .  in most cases ,",
    "qualitatively similar results were obtained for both models .",
    "when the results for the @xmath78-model differ from theose of the fn model , we describe them verbally .",
    "figures [ difi1 ] and [ difi2 ] show typical effects of differential flow on the fdo peak .",
    "differential flow with either fast inhibitor or fast activator transport shifts the position and height of the peak growth rate .",
    "it can also shift slightly the location of the pole in the phase velocity ( i.e. , the zero of @xmath12 )  but usually this shift is less pronounced than the shift of the peak in @xmath11 .  in the case shown in figures",
    "[ difi1 ] and [ difi2 ] ,  the peak height and location are both apparently monotonic in @xmath80 near @xmath81 ;  the peak shifts upward and to the right as @xmath80 decreases .",
    "this is not universal , however .  in some cases",
    "( see for example figures [ puredifi ] and [ difituring ] below ) ,  the peak height has its minimum when @xmath81 , so that faster flow of _ either _ species raises the height of the instability peak .  in one case",
    "we examined using the marginally stable @xmath78-model with @xmath82 , the peak shifts to the right both for @xmath83 and @xmath84 .  what has been referred to as the differential flow instability ( difi )",
    "can be understood a special case in which a growth rate peak whose maximum is less than zero in the absence of differential flow is shifted above zero when @xmath85 , thus creating a convective instability even though the fixed point of the local system is stable .",
    "an example of this is shown in figure [ puredifi ] .",
    "physically , the shifting of the peak relative to the phase velocity pole means that in the presence of differential flow the fastest - growing mode is a travelling wave with some finite velocity , rather than a uniform oscillation .  from figure [ difi2 ]",
    "it is evident that , while the amplitude ratio @xmath68 of the two species remains constant in the pure fdo case @xmath81 ,  differential flow modifies both their amplitude and phase relations in a frequency - dependent manner .",

    "a family of solution curves is shown for @xmath87 ( i.e. , equal diffusion or fast inhibitor diffusion ) .",
    "this is the case that renders a turing instability possible in a stationary medium .",
    "the growth rate peak is distorted somewhat relative to that of the pure fdo case .",
    "this effect was more pronounced in some other examples we studied .  in one case ,",
    "fast inhibitor diffusion lowered and broadened the fdo peak slightly while fast activator diffusion raised and sharpened the peak significantly .  in any case , however , the distortion of the fdo peak is rather less salient than the growth of a second peak at a different frequency .",
    "when this second peak rises above zero , the modes contained within it have two important features :  first , their phase velocity is close to 1 .  the phase velocity curves in fig .",
    "[ turing1 ] flatten out at @xmath88 for the range of amplified frequencies in the second peak .",
    "this means that , in the co - moving frame , the waves are stationary .",
    "second , for frequencies within the range of the second peak ,  the imaginary part of the amplitude ratio @xmath89 is very small ,  indicating a lack of phase lag between the two components .  both of these observations are consistent with the turing instability caused by differential diffusion .",
    "because diffusion is directionally symmetric , a mechanism driven by differential diffusion can not cause a phase lag between the two components .",
    "turing patterns are reflection - symmetric , and stationary in the co - moving frame .  in view of these observations",
    "we attribute the second peak to turing - like modes and refer to it as a turing peak .  in this example",
    "it is quite clearly separated from the fdo peak ,  the latter being characterized by strongly frequency dependent phase velocities  and a non - zero , imaginary component @xmath89 of the amplitude ratio .",
    "there is a range of frequencies between the two peaks for which there are only damped modes .  in some cases",
    ", however , the two peaks can grow broader and almost merge , so that as the driving frequency changes , the resulting waves change continuously from an fdo - like to a turing - like character .",

    "conversely , by choosing the amplitude and phase of the driving to align with the other eigenvector , we excite mostly the other , @xmath62 mode .",
    "eventually , however , the other , faster - growing mode begins to appear , possibly through nonlinear effects or through the small admixture still present in the boundary condition ,  and the @xmath61 mode eventually wins in the asymptotic downstream region .",

    "we have examined the linear stability analysis relevant to the convective growth of spatiotemporal patterns in a reactive flow system , excited by a small sinusoidal perturbation of a fixed point at the inflow boundary .",
    "we examined the real and imaginary parts of the wavenumber as functions of the real boundary forcing frequency .",
    "they represent the downstream growth rate and periodicity of the disturbances caused by a boundary perturbation .",
    "we found that the growth rate as a function of frequency exhibits at most two physically distinct peaks corresponding to two types of waves , one or both of which may be present and convectively unstable .",
    "we found that , in addition to the phase velocity , the complex ratio @xmath68 of activator and inhibitor concentrations , which encodes the relative amplitude and phase of oscillations in the activator and inhibitor concentrations , provides an additional criterion for distinguishing the types of modes .",
    "turing - like modes are distinguished from fdo - like modes by the lack of a phase lag between the two components and by phase velocities that are close to the flow velocity , so that in the co - moving frame they are stationary patterns .",
    "viewing the different types of modes as belonging to peaks in the growth rate , we saw the close relationship between fdo and the differential flow instability .",
    "one can be viewed as a continuous deformation of the other .",
    "a primary effect of differential flow is to shift the fdo peak .",
    "what has been referred to as the differential flow instability ( the appearance of a travelling wave instability in a medium which is neither hopf nor turing unstable ) can be interpreted as a case in which a sub - threshold fdo peak is shifted sufficiently to bring it above zero and to create unstable modes ( fig .",

    "the presence of two peaks could be seen in an experiment in which the perturbation frequency at the inflow is the control parameter .  frequencies for which the growth rate is positive will result in sustained waves , while the waves will die out and fail to propagate if the growth rate is negative .",
    "based on our results we expect that growing waves will appear within at most two frequency ranges .",
    "the phase velocities can also be measured and compared with our general findings .",
    "two types of experiments may be envisaged , in which oscillatory driving is implemented differently .",
    "the first type @xcite@xcite@xcite makes use of a linearly growing , light - sensitive reaction - diffusion system .",
