    "however , due to the small magnitude of a laser wave vector @xmath4 , the transferred momentum is obscured .",
    "this situation justifies the widely adopted dipole approximation in atomic physics , where @xmath5 is set to be zero .",
    "due to the fact that the dipole approximation is expected to work well when the wavelength of the laser is much longer than the target size , almost all previous investigations beyond the dipole approximation were using short wavelengths and focused on nondipole asymmetry @xcite .",
    "in those topics beyond the dipole approximation @xcite , the law of transferred momentum is one of the most interesting and important topics to study @xcite .",
