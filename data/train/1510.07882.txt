    "when phylogenetic trees are considered , i.e. trees describing the evolutionary history of @xmath1 present - day species which label the leaves of the tree , one is often confronted with the need to find the extreme values of the expression    @xmath2    here , @xmath3 varies over all phylogenetic trees with @xmath1 leaves , and @xmath4 is the set of so - called non - trivial splits of @xmath5 induced by @xmath3 . recall that a split @xmath6 of a set @xmath0 is just a bipartition of this set into two non - empty subsets @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( we then write @xmath9 ) , and a split is called non - trivial whenever both parts of the bipartition have cardinality at least 2 .",
    "splits of the species set @xmath0 play an important role in mathematical phylogenetics , because every edge of a phylogenetic tree induces such a split , and splits are non - trivial if and only if they are induced by an inner edge of the tree ( i.e. not by an edge connected to a leaf ) .",
    "moreover , in the above definition of @xmath10 , @xmath11 denotes the cardinality of the smaller part of the split .",
    "such expressions recently appeared in different contexts , each time with a different choice of the monotone function @xmath12 :    1 .",
    "the size of a tbr - neighborhood of the tree @xmath3 with @xmath13 , see @xcite .",
    "this example is also related to the so - called wiener index of the tree @xcite . for this index , you need to assign edge lengths to all edges of @xmath3 . then , the wiener index is defined as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 refers to the vertex set of @xmath3 and @xmath16 refers to the pairwise distances between any two vertices induced by the edge lengths .",
    "an estimate of the diameter of the ( unweighted ) tree space under gromov - type distance measures introduced in @xcite with @xmath17 ( @xmath18gromov ) and @xmath19 ( @xmath20gromov ) .",
    "the number of so - called cherries of a tree , i.e. splits @xmath9 with @xmath21 , can be described with @xmath22{cl }         1&k=2\\\\0&k>2       \\end{array } \\right.$ ] .    in many situations",
    ", it turns out that the extremal shapes ( giving the minimal or maximal values of the functional ) are so - called caterpillars ( i.e. rooted trees with just one cherry or unrooted trees with just two cherries ) and so - called semi - regular trees , i.e. trees which have at most one non - leaf vertex that is not of maximum degree and that such a vertex , if it exists , can not be adjacent to more than one non - leaf vertex @xcite .",
    "while the first kind of trees , the caterpillars , are often considered the most unbalanced tree shapes , the latter kind , i.e. the semi - regular trees , are considered to be most balanced .",
    "this reoccurence is challenging , as there seems to be no study of the whole family of functionals with @xmath23 broadly varying .",
    "we regard the present note as the beginning of this study .    but",
    "how is @xmath24 measuring the balance of the shape of @xmath3 ? intuitively , splits @xmath25 with a high value of @xmath26 are very balanced , and it seems that the maximum of @xmath24 should be attained by the most balanced shapes .",
    "but , more importantly , the balanced tree shapes display _ more _ splits @xmath6 with a small @xmath26 , for example cherries .",
    "thus they realise a smaller value of @xmath27 than caterpillars .",
    "in fact , the arxiv version of @xcite , namely @xcite , provided already the main idea for deriving the maximal value for increasing functions @xmath23 .",
    "as this arxiv version provides a few more details than the published manuscript , we will subsequently refer to that version .",
    "anyway , a lot of structure is required for deriving the minimal value , whereas the maximum is significantly easier to prove , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we will show in the following that for general functions @xmath23 , the main principle becomes even more transparent when considering particular functionals .",
    "last but not least , we also give further applications to topological indices .",
    "let @xmath28 be the set of all ( unrooted ) phylogenetic trees ( i.e. connected acyclic graphs with leaves labelled by a so - called taxon set @xmath0 ) with @xmath29 leaves , and @xmath30 the subset of @xmath28 which contains all fully resolved ( i.e. binary , bifurcating ) trees in @xmath28 ; i.e. the trees in @xmath30 have the property that all vertices have either degree 3 ( inner nodes ) or 1 ( leaves ) .",
    "when there is no ambiguity , we often just say tree when referring to a phylogenetic tree or , when the leaf labeling is not important , its so - called tree shape , respectively .",
    "caterpillars with @xmath1 leaves are binary phylogenetic trees with two leaves , say @xmath31 , such that every vertex of the tree is on the path from @xmath32 to @xmath1 or adjacent to a vertex on this path .",
    "in the so - called newick format @xcite , which gives a nested list of all leaves such that leaves which are separated by fewer edges in the tree are also separated by fewer brackets , caterpillars may be denoted by the expression @xmath33 if @xmath34 , let @xmath35 denote the set of all splits , i.e. all partitions of the leaf set @xmath0 into two non - empty subsets @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and let @xmath4 be the set of all non - trivial splits @xmath9 induced by inner edges of @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath4 contains all splits for which both @xmath36 and @xmath37 . for a split @xmath38 let @xmath39 denote its size .",
    "now we introduce for any function @xmath12 the functional @xmath40 via @xmath41    clearly , a tree and its contraction , obtained by suppressing all inner vertices of degree 2 , share the same value of @xmath27 .",
    "a rotation of the tree , which is obtained by permuting the leaf labels , does not alter the value of @xmath27 either .",
    "so @xmath27 is just a function of the phylogenetic tree shape of @xmath3 .",
    "particularly , all caterpillars get the same value under @xmath27 . the last concept we need to introduce before we can present our results are so - called nni - moves on binary trees .",
    "nni stands for nearest neighbor interchange , and in order to perform an nni - move on a binary tree @xmath3 , you fix an inner edge of @xmath3 .",
    "this edge is connected to four subtrees , two on either side .",
    "you then swap two of these subtrees from opposite sides of the edge .",
    "this procedure is called nni - move , and the resulting tree @xmath42 is called an nni - neighbor of @xmath3 .",
    "you can also define a metric based on nni in order to measure the distance between two trees @xmath3 , @xmath42 such that @xmath43 equals the minimum number of nni moves needed to get from @xmath3 to @xmath42 .",
    "in this section , we consider a function @xmath44 with the additional assumption that @xmath23 is monotonously increasing , i.e. if @xmath45 , then @xmath46 .",
    "the following theorem , which is based on ideas presented in @xcite , shows that caterpillars maximize @xmath27 in this case .",
    "[ thm:1 ] let @xmath47 be a caterpillar and @xmath12 monotonously increasing .",
    "then for all @xmath48 @xmath49    if @xmath23 is strictly increasing and @xmath34 is a point of maximum of @xmath27 , then @xmath3 is a caterpillar .    before presenting the proof , we consider the following elementary lemma , which we will need subsequently .    [ lem : turmsum ] let @xmath12 be strictly monotonously increasing .",
    "then for all @xmath50 and @xmath51 @xmath52    for symmetry reasons we may assume that @xmath53 and consider the function @xmath54 , @xmath55 we find @xmath56 since @xmath57 .",
    "consider first the case that @xmath23 is strictly increasing and @xmath3 is such that @xmath24 is maximal .",

    "so we conclude that the assumption is wrong and @xmath77 for all @xmath78 .",

    "looking for an unconstrained minimum over @xmath28 does not make much sense since it is attained at the most unresolved tree @xmath88 with no inner splits : @xmath89 .",

    "if we restrict our consideration to @xmath90 , instead of considering the minimum of an increasing function , we could equivalently consider decreasing functions @xmath23 and look again at the maximum .",
    "anyway , the analysis is much more difficult , which is why we first need to present an important concept needed in this context , namely the so - called split size sequences .",
    "from now on , we focus on binary trees , and we now introduce so - called split size sequences . in order to obtain these , we first associate to every binary tree @xmath91 the ( multi-)set of split sizes @xmath92 . however , for ease of notation , it is better to work with ordered @xmath93 tuples instead of ( unordered ) sets , which is why we continue with the following definition .",

    "if @xmath3 in this figure is a caterpillar , denoted @xmath79 , it has @xmath101 . in order to get an ( unordered ) sequence of all split sizes , we start at one cherry , say @xmath58 and subsequently consider the splits @xmath102 .",
    "it is clear that the cherry contributes the value 2 to @xmath103 , then we get a 3 , 4 , 5 , and so forth .",
    "however , as soon as there are fewer leaves on the right - hand side , say in set @xmath8 , than on the left - hand side , say in set @xmath7 , where @xmath9 , the sequence will continue with @xmath104 instead of @xmath105 . in the end , we order the elements of @xmath103 increasingly in order to derive @xmath106 . for example , if the caterpillar has @xmath107 leaves , we get @xmath108 , if @xmath109 , we get @xmath110 , if @xmath111 , we get @xmath112 , and so forth .",
    "note that there is an alternative equivalent definition of @xmath99 . at first",
    ", it might seem a little less intuitive , but it proves to be useful in the following . consider the increasing sequence @xmath113 whose entries are defined as follows : @xmath114 then , @xmath115 is just the left inverse of @xmath116 : @xmath117 this means @xmath118    the function @xmath119 will be used in the subsequent proofs .",
    "note that it is not so clear how to characterize @xmath120 , i.e. all possible split size sequences .",
    "however , in the following we investigate them a bit further .",
    "therefore , first of all we order @xmath120 in the pointwise sense .",
    "so we say that @xmath121 is more balanced than @xmath122 , denoted @xmath123 , if @xmath124 or equivalently , @xmath125    this leads to the following theorem .",

    "then , we have @xmath123 if and only if for all monotonously increasing @xmath12 @xmath127    by definition , we have @xmath128 where the inequality is due to @xmath123 , which implies @xmath129 for all @xmath130 , and @xmath23 being monotonously increasing .",
    "this completes the first part of the proof .",
    "now assume we have ( [ eq : dominance ] ) for all monotonously increasing @xmath12 .",
    "then , in particular ( [ eq : dominance ] ) holds for the following family of monotonously increasing functions : for each @xmath131 , define @xmath132{cl }      1&k\\ge j\\\\ 0&k",
    "< j    \\end{array}. \\right.$ ] we obtain @xmath133    by the definition of @xmath134 , this implies @xmath135 this immediately leads to @xmath136 for all @xmath137 and thus @xmath123 .    from an abstract point of view",
    "the result is almost obvious : the functions @xmath132{cl }      0&k < j\\\\ 1&k\\ge j    \\end{array } \\right.$ ] , which we used in the proof of the above theorem , generate the extremal rays of the convex cone @xmath138 and thus determine the order @xmath139 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath140 .    the only maximal point of @xmath120",
    "is derived from the sequence @xmath141 or @xmath142 corresponding to caterpillar trees @xmath3 .",
    "that caterpillars give the only maximal point on @xmath120 is derived easily from the previous two theorems , as for a caterpillar @xmath79 we have @xmath143 for all @xmath144 by theorem [ thm:1 ] , and thus , by theorem [ thm:2 ] we conclude @xmath145 for all @xmath3 .",
    "the split size sequence of caterpillars has already been described above .",
    "thus , the pareto maximum of @xmath120 is unique .",
    "it even corresponds to a unique tree shape .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath99 does not determine the shape of @xmath3 in general .",

    "however , @xmath3 and @xmath42 are different because they differ in the split induced by the central edge : this split separates the two copies of @xmath147 from the two copies of @xmath148 in @xmath3 and thus differs from the edge separating one copy of both @xmath147 and @xmath148 from another copy of @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",

    "we obtain the values @xmath209 for the split sequences in ( [ eq:12splits ] ) .",
    "this means the semi - regular pattern @xmath210 is still the minimizer .",
    "we conclude this section with the following lemma which is used in a later example .",
    "[ bounds ] let @xmath144 with @xmath211 .",
    "then , we have @xmath212    let @xmath6 be the split the size of which is @xmath213 . consider the edge @xmath214 of @xmath3 corresponding to @xmath6 .",
    "note that @xmath214 splits @xmath3 into two parts , which we call the left - hand part and the right - hand part .",
    "moreover , @xmath214 must be an inner edge ( as @xmath215 and thus there is at least one inner edge giving rise to one non - trivial split , so the split of size @xmath213 , which is maximal , has to refer to a non - trivial split ) . without loss of generality assume that the left - hand part of @xmath3 corresponds to @xmath216 .",
    "then , the left - hand side end vertex of edge @xmath214 must have degree 3 ( as @xmath214 is an inner edge ) .",
    "the splits corresponding to the two other edges coincident with this vertex must have a size not larger than @xmath213 .",
    "thus @xmath217 and the lower bound is derived .",
    "the upper bound is trivial .",
    "as we already mentioned in the introduction , functionals of the kind analyzed in the present manuscript have recently occurred in various contexts , some of which we want to mention here .",
    "[ ex : gamma ] in @xcite the authors considered the functional @xmath218 which is equivalent to @xmath27 for @xmath219 .",
    "they considered the functional only on @xmath220 , but for the maximum there is no difference anyway .",
    "the application of theorem [ thm:1 ] is just the same as ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 4.1 ) , where we adapted our proof of theorem [ thm:1 ] from .",
    "further , the minimum is attained for the semi - regular shape , since @xmath23 is even strictly increasing .",
    "there is also a close relation between @xmath221 and the wiener index of @xmath3 as described in the next section , see also @xcite .",
    "[ ex : mp ] recently , the maximum parsimony distance was defined independently in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we will now briefly explain this concept before we show how it is related to the topic of this manuscript .",
    "recall that a character @xmath222 is a function @xmath223 from the leaf set @xmath224 of @xmath3 to an alphabet @xmath225 . in biology",
    ", @xmath225 often refers to the four nucleotides in the dna alphabet , but we do not restrict the definition to this case . then , an extension @xmath226 is a function from the vertex set @xmath15 of @xmath3 to @xmath225 which agrees with @xmath222 on the leaf set @xmath0 . for a character @xmath222 with extension @xmath227 , the changing number of @xmath227 , denoted @xmath228 , is defined as the number of edges @xmath229 such that @xmath230 , and the parsimony score @xmath231 is then defined as the minimum number of changes over all extensions @xmath227 of @xmath222 on @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath232 . note that the parsimony score of a character on a tree can be easily calculated with the famous fitch algorithm @xcite .",
    "now , the parsimony distance between two trees @xmath233 and @xmath234 is defined as follows : @xmath235 .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that it is np - hard to calculate this distance for two given trees ( even if both trees are binary ) .",
    "we now consider neighborhoods induced by this metric .    in @xcite , the size of the 1-neighborhood of a tree @xmath34 with respect to @xmath236",
    "was derived to be @xmath237 where @xmath238 , @xmath239 is the set of vertices of degree @xmath240 after removal of all pendant edges .",
    "clearly , @xmath241 are just all cherries .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath242 is not of the form @xmath27 , but we can provide bounds on the minimal and maximal values , since we have @xmath243 so we get @xmath244 for @xmath245{cl }        4k\\cdot(n - k)&k>2,\\\\ 8(n-2)-c&k=2 .",
    "\\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] clearly , for @xmath246 , particularly for @xmath247 , @xmath23 is strictly increasing and we find maximal values at caterpillars .",
    "note that if you restrict the parsimony distance to binary characters , denoted @xmath248 , and define @xmath249 , where @xmath88 denotes the star - tree , i.e. the tree with no inner edges , then by lemma [ bounds ] , we have @xmath250 and @xmath251 .",
    "it can easily be seen that @xmath23 is maximized by all trees containing an edge inducing a split @xmath9 with @xmath252 and @xmath253 .",
    "caterpillar trees have this property , but they are not the only ones . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath23 is minimized by all trees containing a node which is adjacent to three subtrees of size at least @xmath254 .",
    "therefore , the minimum is not unique , either .",
    "consider the functional @xmath255 , the number of cherries .",
    "clearly , we have to choose @xmath256{cl }      1&k=2,\\\\ 0&\\mbox{otherwise . }",
    "\\end{array } \\right.$ ] since @xmath23 is decreasing and convex ( on @xmath257 ) , the minimum number 2 of cherries is attained by caterpillars only .",
    "the maximal number of cherries is yielded by the semi - regular shapes .",
    "another application are estimates of the diameter of @xmath258 with respect to the gromov - type @xmath259-distances on @xmath28 introduced in @xcite for @xmath260 .",
    "we do not want to repeat the lengthy definition of these distances here .",
    "it is enough to note that example 3 from that paper computed @xmath261 if @xmath3 and @xmath42 differ by one split , say @xmath262 .",
    "then @xmath263{cl }            \\min(|a|,|b| ) & \\mbox{for } p=1,\\\\            \\sqrt{|a|\\cdot|b|/n}&\\mbox{for } p=2 .",
    "\\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] so we fix the functions @xmath264 , @xmath260 , @xmath265 , @xmath266 which are both strictly increasing and concave on @xmath267 .",
    "let @xmath268 denote the star tree , i.e. @xmath269 .",
    "we see for all trees @xmath270 : @xmath271 theorem [ thm:1 ] gives us for even @xmath1 the estimates @xmath272 and @xmath273 on the diameter of @xmath28 .    unfortunately , these bounds are less tight that the ones derived in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 9 ) .",
    "nevertheless the same technique would apply to any other tree distance if we had estimates for robinson - foulds moves @xcite in terms of @xmath26 .",
    "at least , theorem [ thm:1 ] supports now the conjecture that the maximal distance is attained between two caterpillars . but note that we are just dealing with upper bounds on the diameter here .",
    "[ ex : max ] another simple functional is defined through @xmath274 this functional is not of the form @xmath27 .",
    "still , it is monotonously increasing with respect to @xmath139 .",
    "its extremal values @xmath275 were derived in lemma [ bounds ] . by the previous section ,",
    "they are achieved by caterpillars and some pareto minimum , possibly among others .",
    "for @xmath111 we computed the pareto minima , see example [ ex : min8 ] .",
    "@xmath276 realizes the minimal value @xmath277 for @xmath278 .",
    "but , the other ( semi - regular ) split size sequence @xmath279 realizes the _ maximal _ value for @xmath278 .",
    "we derived necessary and sufficient criteria to compute minimal and maximal points of the functionals @xmath27 .",
    "there were a lot of specific functionals of this kind considered in the past , see the previous section . by our theory , it is now less surprising that quite often caterpillars yielded maximal values and the semi - regular trees yielded minimal ones .",
    "but , we also saw that sometimes the minimum of @xmath27 could be achieved by a different pareto minimum .",
    "so the set of split size sequences @xmath120 and their pareto minima seems quite interesting to study .",
    "for instance , it would be nice to know whether all pareto minima , not only the semi - regular one , correspond to a unique tree shape .",
    "the @xmath280index from example [ ex : gamma ] is closely related to the wiener index of graphs , it is its leaf - restricted form . essentially it holds @xmath281 where @xmath16 is the metric induced by @xmath3 and @xmath282 are the leaves of @xmath3 , see @xcite .",
    "this kind of index is natural , unique and of course a shape invariant of @xmath3 .",
    "it is easy to see that we can derive a whole family of similar topological indices if we introduce another metric on the tree , still just depending on the shape of @xmath3 .",
    "more precisely , introduce for any @xmath283 a weight @xmath284 and the corresponding ( semi-)metric @xmath285 on @xmath282 .",
    "then , setting @xmath286 we obtain @xmath287 for @xmath288 .",
    "if @xmath164 is increasing , @xmath23 is increasing as well .",
    "unfortunately , concavity is not so easy to derive .",
    "nevertheless , our theory will apply to many of these @xmath289indices .",
    "surely , these indices are linear in @xmath16 .",
    "it is easy to derive similar functionals which are quadratic in @xmath16 or depending on triple partitions @xmath290 compatible with the tree @xmath3 .",
    "for instance , the functional @xmath291 from example [ ex : mp ] is of this kind",
