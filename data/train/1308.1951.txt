    "the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) is an isotropic , apparently diffuse x - ray emission in the universe which was discovered about 50 years ago @xcite .",
    "it is often assumed that the cxb has been conclusively shown to be the integrated light produced via the accretion process of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , in particular seyferts , hosting supermassive black holes .",
    "this might be correct below @xmath1 5 kev .",
    "emission from active galaxies has indeed been resolved by the deep x - ray surveys by _ chandra _ in the broad 0.52 kev and 210 kev bands .",
    "those objects account for 8090% of the cxb @xcite .",
    "however , energy - resolved studies indicate that the resolved fraction of the cxb decreases with energy as 8090% over 28 kev , @xmath2% over 68 kev , and @xmath3% beyond 8 kev @xcite .    above @xmath4 kev",
    ", the cxb can not be due to superposition of unabsorbed agns , mainly type i seyferts .",
    "those objects show a typical continuum photon index of @xmath5 below 10 kev @xcite , different from that of cxb @xmath6 at 28 kev @xcite . instead , this unresolved , hard component is generally attributed to the emission from absorbed seyferts , the so - called type ii seyferts , which might be buried in dusty tori .",
    "a superposition of such sources with varying degrees of photoelectric absorption by the circumnuclear material can cause the total spectrum to appear harder than spectra of unabsorbed seyferts , but this requires some fine - tuning of absorption properties of sources as a function of redshift and luminosity .",
    "various population synthesis models successfully explain the cxb by introducing appropriate number of absorbed seyferts ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , recent studies @xcite showed that the number of compton thick agns , which are a class of absorbed seyferts and whose column density is larger than the inverse of the thomson cross section , is a factor of 34 less than that expected in the population synthesis models at least locally ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this may pose a serious problem to our current knowledge of the origin of the cxb .",
    "by contrast , the origin of the cosmic mev gamma - ray background at @xmath7 mev has been an intriguing mystery .",
    "the seyfert spectra adopted in population synthesis models of the cxb can not explain this component because of the assumed exponential cutoff at a few hundred kev , where thermal hot corona above the accretion disk is assumed .",
    "above 100 mev , it is known that superposition of blazars ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , starburst galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , and radio galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "these populations may contribute to the mev background as well .",
    "however , the background spectrum from several hundreds kev to several tens mev is smoothly connected to the cxb spectrum and is much softer ( photon index @xmath8 2.8 ) than the gev component @xcite , indicating a different origin from that above 100 mev ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "however , on the basis of the latest measurements of the cosmic sn ia rates , recent studies show that the mev background flux expected from sne ia is about an order of magnitude lower than observed @xcite .",
    "seyferts can naturally explain the mev background including the smooth connection to the cxb @xcite .",
    "comptonized photons produced by non - thermal electrons in hot coronae surrounding accretion disks can produce the mev power - law tail @xcite .",
    "such non - thermal electrons are expected to exist if the corona is heated by magnetic reconnection @xcite .",
    "there is also a class of blazars , called mev blazars , whose spectra peak at mev energies @xcite .",
    "these mev blazars could potentially contribute to the mev background as well @xcite .",
    "radio galaxies have been also discussed as the origin of the mev background @xcite .",
    "however , recent studies show that the expected background flux from radio galaxies is @xmath9% of the total mev background flux @xcite .",
    "annihilation of the dark matter particles has also been discussed @xcite , but those are less natural dark matter candidates , with a mass scale of mev energies , rather than gev - tev dark matter candidates . in either case , there is little observational evidence of mev emission from these candidates and a quantitative estimate is not easy due to the sensitivity of the mev measurements .    the angular power spectrum of the background radiation will shed new light on these problems , since it reflects the distribution of its origin in the entire sky .",
    "the angular power spectrum is obtained by performing a spherical harmonics transformation of the sky intensity map after subtracting foregrounds and point sources . as an aside , both theoretical and observational studies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy has allowed us to precisely determine the total content in the universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "phenomenologically the components of these spectra are measured to show a power - law continuum with a cutoff at @xmath1300 kev in the form of @xmath12 , absorption from surrounding gas , emission lines , and a continuum hump , the called `` reflection component '' , and a soft excess of emission at @xmath13kev , often approximated by a blackbody or a power - law . according to the currently popular unification models , this primary continuum may be absorbed by circumnuclear material , with the degree of absorption related to the inclination of the symmetry axis of the accretion disk : low - luminosity variants of such absorbed agn are seyfert ii galaxies .",

    "reflection component appears as a result of the compton reprocessed emission and bound - free absorption of the primary continuum by cold matter in the accretion disk and the surrounding gas @xcite .    as an aside",

    ", we can clearly distinguish the origin of the mev background candidates , seyferts @xcite and fsrqs @xcite even with current mev instruments including ballon experiments .",
    "however , this requires that these missions can measure the angular power spectrum of the sky .",
    "future mev instruments such as sgd onboard _ astro - h _ , dual , grips , and smile will easily disentangle the origin of the mev background via covering a wide solid angle of the sky with their expected sensitivities .",
    "if the origin of the mev background is non - thermal emission from seyfert @xcite , this implies that magnetic reconnection heats the corona above the disk and accelerate non - thermal electrons in the corona .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , this scenario will be also tested by future observations of individual sources .",
    "for example , the expected flux from ngc 4151 , which is the brightest seyfert galaxy in the hard x - ray sky @xcite , is @xmath165 @xcite , which can not be detected by comptel but by the future mev instruments such as cast , dual , grips , and smile .",
    "if it is fsrqs @xcite , this implies that there are two distinct fsrq populations in mev and gev because of the spectral difference between mev and gev background .",
    "this will suggest that there are two different populations in fsrqs between mev and gev .",
    "this may pose a problem to the agn unification scheme @xcite .",
    "therefore , probing the mev background is another handle on to understanding agn physics .    in our study",
    ", we use the power spectrum of linear dark matter fluctuation @xcite . at a small angular separation , however ,",
    "effects of non - linear dark matter fluctuation on the correlation term can not be ignored @xcite .",
    "non - linear contributions will become important at the scale of @xmath166 @xcite .",

    "@xmath3% of the unresolved cxb flux comes from inside of @xmath169 at the sensitivity of _ e - rosita _ at soft and hard band .",
    "since the correlation term has a peak at @xmath170 , the non - linear effect will not change our results significantly .",

    "mev instruments do not have as small point spread function as x - ray instruments have .",
    "however , the poisson term which is the key to understanding the origin of the mev background does not depend on the multipole",
    ".    gravitational lensing by clusters of galaxies may change the angular power spectrum , since the lensed sources are strongly clustering and are amplified around the lensing cluster .",
    "it has been argued that the observed agn luminosity function could be significantly affected by lensing ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the fraction of lensed agns at @xmath173 is expected to be less than 2% at the sdss limiting sensitivity @xcite .",
    "therefore , the lensing will not affect our results significantly .",
    "other populations such as galaxies are responsible for a fraction of cxb , although it is expected to be @xmath4% @xcite .",
    "they may also alter the shape of the angular power spectrum .",
    "as galaxies are fainter and more numerous than agns , their poisson term will be weaker than that of agns and their correlation term contribution arises at different multipole due to the difference of the distribution in the sky .",
    "the lensing may also alter fluctuation signatures of cxb and the mev background , if they are dominated by galaxies .",
    "a deficit of surface brightness within the central regions of massive galaxy clusters , which is a strong lensing cluster , after removing detected sources has recently measured with the herschel space observatory .",
