    "the statistical inference for diffusion processes described by stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) is currently a subject of intensive researches .",
    "a basic difficulty of this statistical problem is that , except for a few simple examples , the joint distribution of the discrete - time observations of the process has unknown closed - form . to overcome this ,",
    "a number of estimators based on analytical and simulated approximations have been developed during more than three decades .",
    "such methods are the focus of a growing literature .",
    "see , for instance , the review papers by bibby and sorensen ( 1996 ) , prakasa - rao ( 1999 ) , nielsen et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and jimenez et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .    in particular , the present paper deals with the class of quasi - maximum likelihood ( qml ) estimators for the parameter estimation of sdes given a time series of complete observations .",
    "these are the estimators obtained by maximizing a normal log - likelihood function when the assumption of normality is not satisfied and all the components of the diffusion process are discretely observed .",
    "the simplest approximations to this class of estimators are derived , for sdes with additive noise , from the likelihood of the discrete - time process defined by a numerical integrator .",
    "typically , they are derived from the euler - maruyama scheme ( prakasa rao 1983 , yoshida 1992 , florens - zmirou 1989 ) or from the local linearization ( ll ) one ( ozaki 1985 , 1992 ; shoji & ozaki 1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "it have been demonstrated that , when the distance between two consecutive observations remains fixed , these approximate qml estimators are asymptotically biased when the number of observations increases ( florens - zmirou 1989 ) .",
    "however , a number of comparative studies among different estimation methods have shown that , in practical situations in which the distance between observations is small enough , the approximate qml estimators based on ll integrators display the better performance due to their simplicity , computational efficiency and negligible bias ( see , e.g. , shoji & ozaki 1997 , durham & gallant 2002 , singer 2002 , hurn et al . 2007 ) .",
    "therefore , any modification to these approximate qml methods that yields a bias reduction will be useful . in this direction ,",
    "two methods have early been proposed .",
    "for the estimators based on the euler - maruyama integrator , clement ( 1995 ) introduced a correction to the bias by means of simulations .",
    "whereas , on the basis of taylor expansions of the first two conditional moments of the discrete - time process , kessler ( 1997 ) archives similar results .",
    "depending of the specific sde to be estimated , the first method could be computationally time demanding , while the second one could be affected by numerical instabilities resulting from a high order taylor expansion .",
    "more recently , huang ( 2011 ) proposed new estimators based on high - order numerical integrators , which improve the accuracy of the approximation for the first two conditional moments and can be straightforward applied to sdes with multiplicative noise .",
    "a common feature of the approximate qml methods mentioned above is that , once the observations are given , the error between the approximate and the exact moments of the diffusion is fixed and completely determined by the distance between observations . clearly , this fixes the bias of the qml estimation for finite samples and obstructs its asymptotic correction when the number of observations increases .    in this paper , an alternative modification of the conventional approximations to the qml estimator for diffusion processes",
    "is introduced , which is oriented to reduce and control the estimation bias .",
    "this is based on a recursive computation of the first two conditional moments of discrete - time approximations converging to the diffusion process between two consecutive observations .",
    "it is shown that , for finite samples , the resulting approximate estimators converge to the exact qml estimator when the error between the discrete - time approximation and the diffusion process decreases .",
    "for an increasing number of observations , the approximate estimators are asymptotically normal distributed and their bias decreases when the above mentioned error does it . as a particular instance , the approximate qml estimators designed with the well - known local linear approximations for sdes are presented . their convergence , practical algorithms and performance in simulations",
    "are also considered in detail .",
    "the simulations show that , with respect to the conventional qml estimators , the new approximate estimators significantly enhance the parameter estimation of the test equations given a reduced number of discrete observations distant in time , which is a typical situation in many practical inference problems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , basic notations and definitions",
    "are presented . in section 3 ,",
    "the new approximate estimators are defined and some of their properties are studied .",
    "as example , the order-@xmath0 qml estimator based on the local linearization schemes is presented in section 4 , as well as algorithms for its practical implementation . in the last section ,",
    "the performance of the new estimators is illustrated with various examples .",

    "because the first two conditional moments of @xmath7 are correctly specified , the score of the normal log - likelihood satisfies the martingale difference property , and so the qml estimator ( [ qml estimator ] ) is consistent and has an asymptotically normal distribution . see bollerslev & wooldridge * *  * * ( 1992 ) and wooldridge * *  * * ( 1994 ) for ergodic and no ergodic processes , respectively .    in general , since the conditional mean and variance of equation ( [ sde plk ] ) have not explicit formulas , approximations to them are needed .",

    "approximate estimators of this type have early been considered in a number of papers ( prakasa rao 1983 ; florens - zmirou 1989 ; yoshida 1992 ; ozaki 1985 , 1992 ; shoji & ozaki 1997 , 1998 ) and recently in huang ( 2011 ) . in all of them ,",
    "the approximate mean @xmath45 and variance @xmath46 are derived from a discrete - time scheme @xmath47 that approximate to @xmath48 in just one step of size @xmath49 from the observation @xmath35 .",
    "indistinctly , these estimators are called pseudo - likelihood estimators , or minimum contrast estimators or prediction error estimators depending of the inferential considerations that want to be emphasized . it has been proved ( florens - zmirou , 1989 ) that , for the time partition @xmath50 with @xmath51 fixed , these estimators are biased as @xmath52 .",

    "further note that , once the data @xmath29 are given ( and so the time partition @xmath58 is specified ) , the error between @xmath59 and @xmath48 is completely settled by @xmath49 and can not be reduced . in this way , the difference between the approximate quasi - maximum likelihood estimator @xmath60 and the exact one @xmath61 can not be reduced neither .",

    "for the same reason , the order-@xmath0 qml estimator ( [ ll - based qml estimator ] ) has the asymptotic properties stated in theorem [ plk main theorem ] , and the average of their values for different realizations of the sde satisfies the convergence property of theorem [ plk week convergence ] .    for one - dimensional sdes with additive noise",
    ", the order-@xmath0 qml estimator ( [ ll - based qml estimator ] ) reduces to the conventional estimators of ozaki ( 1985 , 1992 ) and shoji & ozaki ( 1997 , 1998 ) when @xmath262 .",
    "it is worth to emphasize that , for each data @xmath23 , the formulas ( [ allf8])-([allf9 ] ) are recursively evaluated at all the time instants @xmath263 @xmath211 @xmath264\\}$ ] for the first estimator , whereas they are evaluated only at @xmath265 @xmath211 @xmath266\\}$ ] for the conventional ones .    from computational viewpoint ,",
    "each evaluation of  the formulas ( [ allf8])-([allf9 ] ) at @xmath209 requires the computation of just one exponential matrix whose matrix depends of the drift and diffusion coefficients of ( [ sde plk ] ) at @xmath267 .",
    "this exponential matrix can the efficiently computed through the well known pad method ( moler & van loan , 2003 ) or , alternatively , by means of the krylov subspace method ( moler & van loan , 2003 ) in the case of high dimensional sdes .",
    "even more , low order pad and krylov methods as suggested in jimenez & de la cruz ( 2012 ) can be used as well for reducing the computation cost , but preserving the order-@xmath0 of the approximate moments .",
    "alternatively , simplified formulas for the moments can be used when the equation to be estimate is autonomous or has additive noise ( see jimenez , 2012a ) .",
    "all this makes simple and efficient the evaluation of the approximate predictors @xmath268 and @xmath269 .    in practical situations ,",
    "it is convenient to write a code that automatically determines the time discretization @xmath270 for achieving a prescribed absolute ( @xmath271 and relative ( @xmath272 error tolerance in the computation of @xmath268 and @xmath224 . with this purpose",
    "the adaptive strategy proposed in jimenez ( 2012b ) is useful .",
    "in this section , the performance of the new approximate estimators is illustrated , by means of simulations , with four test sdes .",
    "to do so , four types of qml estimators are computed and compared : 1 ) the exact one ( qml estimator ) , when it is possible ; 2 ) the conventional one based on the ll scheme .",

    "autonomous or non autonomous , linear or nonlinear , one or two dimensional equations with additive or multiplicative noise are considered for the estimation of two or three parameters .",
    "note that , since the first two conditional moments of the examples 1 and 2 have explicit expressions , the exact qml estimator ( [ qml estimator ] ) can be computed .",
    "these four equations have previously been used in jimenez ( 2012b ) to illustrate the convergence of the approximate moments ( [ allf8])-(allf9 ) by means of simulations .",
    "tables with the errors between the approximate moments and the exact ones as a function of @xmath98 were given for the examples 1 and 2 .",
    "tables with the estimated rate of convergence were provided for the fours examples .",
    "for the first two examples , @xmath307 realizations of the solution were computed by means of the euler ( kloeden & platen , 1999 ) or the local linearization scheme ( jimenez et al . , 1999 ) for the equation with multiplicative or additive noise , respectively .",
    "for each example , the realizations where computed over the thin time partition @xmath308 to guarantee a precise simulation of the stochastic solutions on the time interval @xmath309 $ ] . twelve subsamples of each realization at the time instants @xmath310 @xmath311 were taken as observation @xmath29 of @xmath7 for making inference with various values of @xmath20 and @xmath312 . in particular , the values @xmath313 and @xmath314 with @xmath315 were used . in this way , twelve sets of @xmath307 time series @xmath316 @xmath317 , with @xmath318 , of @xmath20 observations @xmath319 each one were finally available for each example with the twelve values of @xmath320 mentioned above .",
    "this will allow us to explore and compare the performance of each estimator from observations taken with different sampling periods @xmath321  on time intervals with distinct lengths @xmath312 .",
    "figure 1 shows the histograms and the confidence limits for both , the exact ( @xmath322 ) and the conventional ( @xmath323 ) qml estimators of @xmath324 computed from the twelve sets of @xmath325 time series @xmath326 available for the example 1 .",
    "figure 2 shows the same but , for the exact ( @xmath327 ) and the conventional ( @xmath328 ) qml estimators of @xmath4 .",
    "as it was expected , for the samples @xmath326 with largest sampling periods , the parameter estimation is distorted by the well - known lowpass filter effect of signals sampling ( see , e.g. , oppenheim & schafer , 2010 ) .",
    "this is the reason of the under estimation of the variance @xmath329 from the samples @xmath330 , with @xmath331 and @xmath313 , when the parameter @xmath324 in the drift coefficient of ( [ se ej1 ] ) is better estimated by @xmath332 .",
    "contrarily , from these samples , the conventional qml estimators @xmath333 can not provided a good approximation to @xmath324 , and so the whole unexplained component of the drift term of ( [ se ej1 ] ) included in the samples is interpreted as noise by the conventional qml estimators . for this reason , @xmath334 over estimates the value of the parameter @xmath4 .",
    "further , note that when the sampling period @xmath321 decreases and the length @xmath312 of the observation time increases , the difference between the exact ( @xmath335 ) and the conventional ( @xmath336 ) qml estimators decreases , as well as the bias of both estimators .",
    "this is also other expected result . here",
    ", the bias is estimated by the difference between the parameter value and the estimator average , whereas the difference between estimators refers to the histogram shape and confidence limits .",

    "the values of @xmath98 were set as @xmath349 for the example 3 , and as @xmath350 for the example 4 .",
    "the tolerances for the adaptive estimators were set as in the first example .",
    "figures 9 and 11 show the histograms and the confidence limits for the estimators ( @xmath351 ) and ( @xmath352 ) corresponding to each example .",
    "for the two examples , the difference between the order-@xmath275 qml estimator ( @xmath353 ) and the adaptive one ( @xmath354 ) decreases when @xmath98 does it .",
    "this is , according theorem [ plk convergence theorem ] , an expected result by assuming that the difference between the adaptive and the exact qlm estimators is negligible for @xmath277 thin enough .",
    "in addition , table v and vi show the bias of the approximate qml estimators for these examples .",
    "observe as the adaptive ( @xmath355 ) and the order-@xmath275 qml estimator ( @xmath356 ) with @xmath357 provide much less biased estimation of the parameters @xmath358 than the conventional qml estimator ( @xmath359 ) , which is in fact unable to identify the parameters of the examples .",
    "clearly , this illustrates the usefulness of the order-@xmath275 qml estimator and its adaptive implementation .",
    "however , as it is shown in table v for @xmath360 , no always the adaptive estimator ( @xmath361 ) is less unbiased than the order-@xmath275 qml estimator ( @xmath362 ) for some @xmath357 .",
    "this can happen for one of following reasons : 1 ) the bias of the exact qmlestimator when the adaptive estimator is close enough to it , or 2 ) an insufficient number of accepted steps of the adaptive estimator for a given tolerance . in our case , since ( @xmath363 ) converges to ( @xmath364 ) as @xmath98 decreases ( figure 9 with @xmath365 ) and the average of accepted steps of the adaptive estimators is acceptable ( figure 10 with @xmath360 ) , the first explanation is more suitable .",
    "figures 10 and 12 show the average of accepted and fail steps of the adaptive qml estimators at each @xmath366 for each example .",
    "note how the average of accepted steps corresponding to the estimators from samples with @xmath360 is ten time lower than that of the estimators from samples with @xmath331 , which is an expected result as well .",
    "a modification of the conventional approximations to the quasi - maximum likelihood ( qml ) method was introduced for the parameter estimation of diffusion processes given a time series of complete observations .",
    "this is based on a recursive approximation to the first two conditional moments of the diffusion process through discrete - time schemes . for finite samples ,",
    "the convergence of the modified qml estimators to the exact one was proved when the error between the discrete - time approximation and the diffusion process decreases .",
    "it was also demonstrated that , for an increasing number of observations , they are asymptotically normal distributed and their bias decreases when the above mentioned error does it .",
    "as particular instance , the order-@xmath0 qml estimators based on local linearization schemes were proposed . for them ,",
    "practical algorithms were also provided and their performance in simulation illustrated with various examples .",
    "simulations shown that : 1 ) with thin time discretizations between observations , the order-@xmath275 qml estimator provides satisfactory approximations to the exact qml estimator ; 2 ) the convergence of the order-@xmath275 qml estimator to the exact one when the maximum stepsize of the time discretization between observations decreases ; 3 ) with respect to the conventional qml estimator , the order-@xmath275 qml estimator gives much better approximation to the exact qml estimator , and has less bias and higher efficiency ; 4 ) with an adequate tolerance , the adaptive order-@xmath275 qml estimator gives an automatic , suitable and computational efficient approximation to the exact qml estimator ; and 5 ) the effectiveness of the order-@xmath275 qml estimator for the identification of sdes from a reduced number of complete observations distant in time .",
    "further note that new estimators can also be easily applied to a variety of practical problems with sequential random measurements or with multiple missing data",
