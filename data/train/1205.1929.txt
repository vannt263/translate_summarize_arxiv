    "blazars are a subclass of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) characterized by non - thermal continuum emission from radio to @xmath7-rays .",
    "they have extreme properties : they are strongly variable across the full electromagnetic spectrum , reach very high observed luminosities and are frequently strongly polarized .",
    "their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is characterized by two broad peaks in * @xmath8*. the first peak occurs at a frequency @xmath9 varying from @xmath10hz to @xmath11hz ( @xmath12 to @xmath13 ) @xcite and is attributed to doppler boosted synchrotron emission from a highly relativistic jet pointing towards the observer .",
    "the continuum spectrum is `` flat '' ( spectral index @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) from radio to sub - mm or even shorter wavelengths .",
    "the second peak , attributed to inverse compton scattering , occurs at @xmath7-ray energies .",
    "however , the non - thermal emission not always outshine other components , like emission from the host galaxy , from the accretion disk and from the circum - nuclear torus , to the point of making such components undetectable .",
    "blazar hosts are generally found to be early - type galaxies @xcite and may therefore contaminate the non - thermal spectrum primarily at optical / near - ir wavelengths .",
    "however , we should also take into account the possibility that at least some of them are endowed with star formation activity associated with thermal dust emission at far - ir / sub - mm wavelengths .",
    "the direct thermal emission from the accretion disk may show up as a relatively narrow ` bump ' in the optical / uv @xcite while the thermal emission from the dusty circum - nuclear torus may be detectable in the mid - ir @xcite .",
    "the optical spectra of blazars show a striking dichotomy , leading to the recognition of two sub - classes : bl lacertae objects ( bl lacs ) with an almost featureless spectrum , and flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) with strong , broad emission lines .",
    "@xcite classified the bl lacs on the basis of the synchrotron peak frequency , @xmath9 , into low , intermediate and high frequency peaked .",
    "this classification was extended by @xcite to all blazars : low synchrotron peak ( lsp : @xmath16hz ) , intermediate synchrotron peak ( isp : @xmath17hz ) and high synchrotron peak ( hsp : @xmath18hz ) objects .",
    "the distribution of @xmath9 is bimodal , with only a minor fraction of objects peaking at intermediate frequencies .",
    "the bimodality however may be , at least partly , due to the blazar selection which , so far , was mostly done either in the radio or in the x - ray band .",
    "the former selection favours lsps , the latter hsps .",
    "the _ herschel _ selection , at intermediate frequencies , should help us to pick up isps , thus providing constraints on the abundance of these objects and indications on whether or not there is a continuity in the blazar population , from lsps to hsps .",
    "moreover , a full frequency coverage is crucial to disentangle the different , non - thermal and thermal , contributions to the blazar seds , as briefly summarized above .",
    "astrophysical terahertz large area survey ( h - atlas ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the largest area survey carried out by the _ herschel _ space observatory @xcite covering @xmath19 with pacs @xcite and spire @xcite instruments between 100 and @xmath0 m , provides an unprecedented opportunity to obtain flux density limited blazar samples at sub - mm wavelengths . as for the non - thermal emission ,",
    "the _ herschel _ data cover a particularly interesting frequency range close to the synchrotron peak of the most luminous lsps @xcite , where information is currently scanty @xcite .",
    "since @xmath20 carries information on the lorentz factor @xmath21 of emitting electrons , on the doppler factor @xmath22 and on the magnetic field strength @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) , its value provides crucially important information on key physical parameters .",
    "moreover , the sub - mm selection is especially well suited to look for signatures of thermal dust emission from the host galaxy , thus providing a new perspective on blazar hosts and allowing us to test the early - type host paradigm .",
    "blazars are however a tiny fraction of h - atlas sources : their estimated surface density at the h - atlas @xmath25 detection limits is @xmath26 percent or less of the surface density of dusty galaxies .",
    "singling them out is not easy and appropriate diagnostic tools must be devised .",
    "an investigation of the h - atlas science demonstration phase ( sdp ) field @xcite uncovered two blazars brighter than the average @xmath27 detection limit at @xmath0 m , @xmath28mjy @xcite , over an area of @xmath29 . in this paper",
    "we extend the analysis to an area almost an order of magnitude larger .",
    "this allows us to build the first statistically meaningful sample of sub - mm selected blazars .",
    "the layout of this paper is the following . in section[sec",
    ": candidates ] we describe the selection of candidate blazars , present the new diagnostic diagrams we have devised , and report on the follow - up observations aimed at assessing the nature of the selected candidates . in section[sec : seds ] we briefly discuss their seds , built by combining the h - atlas photometry with literature and unpublished viking data . in section[sec : counts ] we discuss constraints on sub - mm blazar counts and implications for evolutionary models .",
    "finally , section[sec : conclusions ] summarizes our main results .",
    "we adopt a flat cosmology with @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 as derived from wmap 7-yr data @xcite .",
    "in this study we use the catalogue of spire sources detected in the two h - atlas equatorial fields centred at about 9h and 15h , plus half of that at 12h , with areas of @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , respectively , for a total of @xmath36 . in the phase 1 data release [ hoyos et al .",
    "( in preparation ) , valiante et al .",
    "( in preparation ) ] data for the full 12h field will be included .",
    "the catalogue contains sources that have been detected in the noise - weighted psf - filtered 250 @xmath37 m map applying the madx algorithm @xcite .",
    "then , at the position of the sources , flux densities are estimated at each of the spire bands .",
    "finally , only sources with a signal - to - noise @xmath38 at any of the spire bands are included in the catalogue .",
    "the h - atlas maps and data reduction are discussed in @xcite and @xcite , the source catalogue creation is described in @xcite .",
    "the spire beams have fwhm of @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 arcsec for 250 , 350 and @xmath0 m respectively @xcite .",
    "the catalogue we have used contains 66535 unique objects ( 26369 in the 9h field , 12686 in the 12h field , and 27480 in the 15h field ) .",
    "since blazars have red sub - mm colours they are more easily singled out at the longer wavelengths .",
    "we have therefore confined ourselves to sources with @xmath42mjy , corresponding to @xmath43 detections at this wavelength .",
    "there are 11655 sources satisfying this criterion .",
    "blazars are powerful radio sources .",
    "thus the first step towards spotting them is to require that they are detected by radio surveys covering our fields",
    ". a cross correlation of these sources with the first ( faint images of the radio sky at twenty - cm ) survey catalogue @xcite with a @xmath44 arcsec search radius yields 379 matches , out of the @xmath45 first sources present in the @xmath46 h - atlas equatorial fields .",
    "the sample made of the 379 sources selected as described above ( @xmath42mjy and first counterpart within @xmath44 arcsec ) will be referred to as the parent sample .",
    "the typical rms positional error for our sources is @xmath47 arcsec or less @xcite sources as most ( 355 ) of the 379 sources in the parent sample are . ] , and the first positions are accurate to better than @xmath48 arcsec for @xmath49mjy , so that the rms offset between the radio and the sub - mm position is @xmath50 arcsec ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ra_dec_offset ] ) . in the case of a gaussian distribution of positional errors",
    "the probability that a true counterpart has an apparent positional offset @xmath51 is @xmath52.\\ ] ] for @xmath53 arcsec , @xmath54 and the number of true first counterparts that we may have missed with our 11655 trials is @xmath55 , i.e. @xmath56 percent of the parent sample .",
    "the surface density of first sources is @xmath57 .",
    "therefore the probability that a first source lies by chance within @xmath53 arcsec from a given _ herschel _ source is @xmath58 and the expected number of chance associations is @xmath59 .",
    "however , as we will see in the following , from the distribution of @xmath60 flux density ratios of known blazars we infer that genuine blazars must have @xmath61 or , in our case , @xmath62mjy .",
    "the surface density above this limit is @xmath63 and the number of chance associations decreases to @xmath64 .     and",
    "[ tab : tabla_candidates ] ) .",
    "the other data points and the boundaries of the ` wise blazar strip ' are from @xcite .",
    "bzb , bzq , and bzu stand for bl lac , flat - spectrum radio quasar , and blazar of uncertain type , respectively .",
    "the contours tracing the density of sources in colour bins with annotations showing the location of different classes of objects are from the wise explanatory supplement @xcite.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]      a characteristic property of blazars is their peculiar continuum spectrum .",
    "this property allows us to construct diagnostic diagrams useful to select the tiny fraction of blazar candidates out of the overwhelming number of dusty galaxies .",
    "the relatively flat non - thermal continuum of blazars from radio to sub - mm wavelengths implies that they have red sub - mm colours and sub - mm to radio flux density ratios substantially lower than those of dusty galaxies .",
    "thus we expect that blazars occupy in , e.g. , the @xmath2 vs @xmath3 plane a region separated from that populated by sub - mm galaxies dominated by thermal dust emission .",
    "this expectation is borne out by the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : col_plot ] . to locate the `` blazar region '' in this diagram we have looked for known blazars among the 379 sources in the parent sample by cross - matching them with the most recent version of the blazar catalogue bzcat @xcite , again with a search radius of @xmath44 arcsec .",
    "we got 8 matches ( see table  [ tab : tabla_confirm8 ] ) . since the bzcat positions are mostly taken from radio catalogues and are generally better than @xmath65 arcsec , after eq .",
    "( [ eq : prob ] ) the expected number of real matches that may have been missed with our 379 trials is @xmath66 .",
    "the probability that a bzcat source lies by chance within @xmath44 arcsec from a given _ herschel _ source is difficult to assess accurately because of the inhomogeneous distribution of bzcat sources .",
    "however the bzcat catalogue contains @xmath67 sources over the whole sky so that their mean surface density is @xmath68 .",
    "if they were uniformly distributed the expected number of chance associations would be @xmath69 .",
    "there is therefore a wide enough margin to confidently assume that all the associations found are real even though the distribution is not uniform . in particular , of the 8 matches found with a search radius of @xmath44 arcsec , the two with the largest angular distance to a first source ( objects @xmath70 and @xmath71 of table  [ tab : tabla_confirm8 ] , with a separation of @xmath72 and @xmath73 arcsec , respectively ) have @xmath74 mjy . since the surface density of first sources brighter than 300 mjy is @xmath75 , the probability of a chance association within @xmath44 arcsec is @xmath76 and the expected number of chance associations within @xmath44 arcsec is 0.13 . on the other hand , after eq .",
    "( [ eq : prob ] ) the probability that a true counterpart has a positional offset of 9.72 arcsec or of 8.67 arcsec is @xmath77 or @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "thus the blazar classification of these 2 h - atlas sources must be taken with caution .    in the bzcat catalogue",
    "there are an additional 15 blazars located in our fields . for only two of them",
    "could we detect a significant signal in the h - atlas noise - weighted beam convolved maps .",
    "one ( bzbj0849 + 0206 ) has a @xmath0 m flux density of 31.6 mjy ( @xmath79 ) and is weaker at 250 and @xmath80 m ( @xmath81 and 2.2 , respectively ) . since this object is fainter than the adopted flux - density limit ( @xmath82mjy ) we have not considered it further .",
    "the other object ( bzqj1404 - 0013 ) has @xmath83mjy , i.e. is a @xmath27 detection at this wavelength , but is below the @xmath27 detection limit at 250 and @xmath80 m ( @xmath84mjy and @xmath85mjy ) .",
    "it was probably missed because of its low @xmath86 m flux density ( candidate sources were identified as @xmath87 peaks at @xmath86 m ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; moreover , it lies close to the border of the field .",
    "we have added this source to our blazar sample .",
    "we have also searched the 2-yr _ fermi_-lat catalogue @xcite for counterparts of our sources that might be blazars not listed in the bzcat .",
    "none was found : the only _",
    "fermi_-lat source located within our fields and not listed in the bzcat is identified as a pulsar and is about @xmath88 arcmin away from the nearest source in the parent sample .    to increase the sample of known blazars with measured sub - mm colours we have cross - correlated with the bzcat the full - sky _ planck",
    "_ early release compact source catalogue ( ercsc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which consists of sources with flux density measurements at both 545 and 857 ghz .",
    "we found 14 matches the additional data available in the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) show that one of these sources , bzuj1325 - 4301 , is the well known extended radio galaxy centaurus a , while the blazar classification of bzbj1136 + 1601 is dubious and bzuj2209 - 4710 ( alias ngc  7213 ) has sub - mm colours indicative of a strong contamination by thermal dust emission from the host galaxy .",
    "moreover , the ercsc flux densities of bzqj1559 + 0304 and bzqj1719 + 0817 may be affected by source blending .",
    "the flux density ratios for these sources are therefore not representative of the blazar non - thermal continuum .",
    "we are then left with 9 blazars ( see table  [ tab : tabla_ercsc ] ) , whose colours are also plotted in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : col_plot ] . according to the technical specifications of their respective instruments ,",
    "planck_/hfi 857 ghz and the _",
    "herschel_/spire @xmath80 m channels have almost exactly the same central wavelength and roughly the same bandwidth .",
    "the comparison between the _ planck _",
    "545 ghz and the spire @xmath0 m flux densities requires a colour correction because the central frequency of the @xmath0 m channel is somewhat higher ( @xmath89ghz ) . the extrapolation from 545 ghz to 600 ghz",
    "was made using , for each _ planck _ blazar , its spectral index between 545 and 857 ghz ; since the spectral indices are quite flat , the corrections are small .    the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : col_plot ] shows that the 9 known blazars in our h - atlas fields and the 9 ercsc blazars lie in a region in the @xmath3 vs @xmath2 plane fairly well separated from the region populated by the majority of the other sources in our parent sample that have a @xmath90 , typical of star forming galaxies . to illustrate this further ,",
    "we have included in this panel a thick dashed line that represents the colour track as a function of redshift of the prototype starburst galaxy arp  220 .",
    "objects with @xmath91 likely have radio emission dominated by an agn component , that since we are using low - frequency ( 1.4 ghz ) radio observations , is expected to be mostly steep - spectrum ( i.e. not associated to blazars )",
    ".    the @xmath60 ratios of blazars are @xmath92 and their @xmath93 colours are redder than average .",
    "this upper limit to @xmath60 ratio for blazars comes from the ercsc objects , while the h - atlas ones , which may be thought to be more relevant here , have significantly lower ratios .",
    "but we must beware of a selection effect . since the bzcat blazars are mostly radio selected ( with important additions from x - ray and @xmath7-ray selections ) , relatively radio - faint objects , such as possible h - atlas blazars with high @xmath60 ratios , are easily missed by previous blazar searches . in fact , as will be seen in the following , our candidate h - atlas blazars have very limited photometric data .",
    "the situation is different for the much ( generally more than 10 times ) brighter ercsc blazars for which we likely have the full range of @xmath60 ratios .",
    "we have therefore adopted as the limiting ratio , the maximum value for ercsc blazars .",
    "indeed the main strength of the sub - mm selection compared to the traditional ones is its unique efficiency in selecting objects with high @xmath60 ratios .",
    "this means that even with the adopted limiting ratio we may miss some blazars . for this reason we plan follow - up observations also of objects with ratios above the chosen limit",
    "although we expect that such objects are unlikely to be blazars .",
    "the criterion @xmath94 yields 12 new candidate blazars in our parent sample ( see table  [ tab : tabla_candidates ] ) . from them",
    ", 7 have an angular distance to a first source @xmath95 arcsec and a @xmath96 .",
    "since the surface density of the first sources at this flux density limit is @xmath97 , the expected number of chance associations for angular distances between 5 and 10 arcsec is @xmath98 and some of these associations may indeed be spurious . thus almost of all the objects in our parent sample are likely to be pure star - forming galaxies or radio galaxies in star - forming hosts as studied in @xcite and @xcite respectively .    as a second diagnostic tool",
    ", we have built the @xmath4 vs. @xmath5 colour - colour diagram ( lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : col_plot ] ) for known blazars by cross - correlating the sdss dr8 catalogue @xcite with the bzcat , using a search radius of @xmath48 arcsec .",
    "the surface density of dr8 sources is @xmath99 so that the probability of a chance association within @xmath48 arcsec is @xmath100 .",
    "since there are @xmath101 bzcat sources within the dr8 area , we expect @xmath102 chance associations .",

    "four of our blazar candidates ( #  12 , 13 , 18 , and 21 ) have wise colours typical of starburst galaxies , and two ( #  17 and 19 ) are in the region populated by liners / obscured agns .",
