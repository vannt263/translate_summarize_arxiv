    "this short paper is parallel to ref.@xcite and focuses on the calculation of the leading order wave functions of @xmath3 decay and the extraction of @xmath2 by using the light cone sum rules in the effective theory of heavy quark .",
    "it is organized as follows : in section 2 , we present the analytic formulae for @xmath3 decay in the effective theory of heavy quark . in section 3 ,",
    "the relevant light cone sum rules are derived within the framework of effective theory . in section 4",
    "we present the numerical results including the extracted value of @xmath2 .",
    "the value of @xmath2 is compared with that extracted via @xmath6 decay .",
    "a short summary is drawed in the last section .",
    "the @xmath7 decay matrix element is generally written in terms of four form factors as @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the momentum and polarization vectors of the @xmath11 meson , and @xmath12 is the momentum carried by the lepton pair .    in the effective theory of heavy quark , heavy quark expansion ( hqe )",

    ". the @xmath83 range of interest should be similar to that in the light cone sum rule analysis for the @xmath87 decay @xcite , i.e. , @xmath88gev .",
    "it can be seen from fig.1 that , in general consideration , the good stability of the form factors exists at the threshold @xmath89gev .",
    "with such a threshold energy , we are now in the stage to evaluate the @xmath84 dependence of the form factors",
    ". it should be intuitive and convenient to represent these form factors in an algebraic representation .",
    "we parametrize each form factor in terms of a set of three parameters as follows , @xmath90 where @xmath91 can be any one of @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",

    "the form factors as functions of the momentum transfer @xmath84 are also shown in fig.2 .          when the lepton masses are neglected , the differential decay width of @xmath100 with respect to the momentum transfer @xmath84 is @xcite @xmath101 with the helicity amplitudes @xmath102 and @xmath103 so , with the meson masses @xmath104gev , @xmath105gev and the maximum momentum transfer @xmath106 , the integrated width of @xmath107 turns out to be @xmath108 the error in eq.([width ] ) results from the variation of the threshold energy @xmath109gev .    on the other hand , the branching fraction of @xmath110 is measured by cleo collaboration @xcite , @xmath111 . with the world average of the @xmath112 lifetime @xcite , @xmath113",

    "the modification from higher distribution functions is hard to calculate at present because little is known about the high distribution functions themselves .",
    "it is found from the sum rule analysis that the two - loop qcd perturbative corrections may enlarge the constant @xmath79 by about 25% , and increase @xmath78 at the same time @xcite . to be consistent , one should also include the qcd corrections for the correlation function at the same order . as such higher order qcd corrections to the correlator have not been considered here , we should take the two - loop qcd corrections of the decay constant @xmath79 as the theoretical uncertainty . including this uncertainty ,",
    "our final result for @xmath2 is latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } \\label{vub }    may be compared with the one obtained in ref.@xcite from @xmath6 decay by using the same approach , @xmath117 ) and ( [ vubfrompi ] ) within their errors proves the consistency of our light cone sum rule calculations of heavy to light semileptonic b decays in the framework of the effective theory of heavy quark .",
    "we also notice that the theoretical error in ( [ vub ] ) is larger than that in ( [ vubfrompi ] ) , which is not out of expectation since we only include the leading twist distribution functions in the @xmath100 calculation .",
    "this reflects the importance of a more complete study on the @xmath11 distribution functions .",
    "the estimate in eq.([vub ] ) is in agreement with that derived from full qcd calculation @xcite , and it is also close to the combined result from the analyses based on different models and treatments on @xmath118 transitions , @xmath119 summary -------    we have studied @xmath3 decay within the framework of effective theory of heavy quark . in the effective theory , the relevant matrix elements can be expanded in powers of the inverse of the heavy quark mass . at the leading order approximation ,",
    "the form factors concerned in this decay are related to four universal wave functions , which are independent of the heavy quark mass @xmath120 .",
    "though the hqs loses some predictive power in the heavy to light decays , it would be helpful for relating different heavy to light decay channels .",
    "for example , @xmath3 and @xmath121 decays are characterized at the leading order of @xmath1 by the same set of wave functions , @xmath22 .",
    "the form factors for @xmath3 have been calculated in the effective theory using the light cone sum rule approach .",
    "the important ckm matrix element @xmath2 has been extracted by comparing the values of integrated width obtained from sum rule calculations and from the experimental measurements .",
    "the result is @xmath122 decay by using the same approach within the framework of the effective theory of heavy quark .",
    "this calculation has further shown the reliability of the heavy quark expansion and the predictive power of light cone sum rule approach in studying heavy to light exclusive decays .",
    "we have used @xmath3 decay as an example for concret discussion . however , the method is general and the main formulae in this paper can be used to other heavy to light vector semileptonic decays after trival modifications such as simple replacement of some parameters .    in this paper , we have considered only the leading twist 2 distribution functions of @xmath11 meson .",
    "both the higher twist and loop corrections and higher order @xmath1 contributions should be included for a more accurate estimation of @xmath2 .",
    "it is noted that higher order @xmath1 corrections may have different forms in the usual heavy quark effective theory and the new framework of heavy quark effective field theory @xcite due to the antiquark contributions .",
