    "the kolkata paise restaurant ( kpr ) problem ( see @xcite ) is a repeated game , played between a large number of agents having no interaction among themselves . in kpr ,",
    "@xmath0 prospective customers choose from @xmath0 restaurants each evening ( time @xmath1 ) in a parallel decision mode .",
    "each restaurant have identical price but different rank @xmath2 ( agreed by the all the @xmath0 agents ) and can serve only one customer .",
    "if more than one agents arrive at any restaurant on any evening , one of them is randomly chosen and is served and the rest do not get dinner that evening .",
    "information regarding the agent distributions etc for earlier evenings are available to everyone .",
    "each evening , each agent makes his / her decision independent of others .",
    "each agent has an objective to arrive at the highest possible ranked restaurant , avoiding the crowd so that he or she gets dinner there . because of fluctuations",
    "( in avoiding herding behavior ) , more than one agents may choose the same restaurant and all of them , except the one randomly chosen by the restaurant , then miss dinner that evening and they are likely to change their strategy for choosing the respective restaurants next evening . as can be easily seen , no arrangement of the agent distribution among the restaurants can satisfy everybody on any evening and the dynamics of optimal choice continues for ever . on a collective level",
    ", we look for the fraction ( @xmath3 ) of customers getting dinner in any evening and also its distribution for various strategies of the game",
    ".    it might be interesting to note here that for kpr , most of the strategies will give a low average ( over evenings ) value of resource utilization ( average fraction @xmath4 ) , because of the absence of mutual interaction / discussion among the agents .",
    "however , a simple ( dictated ) strategy , instructing each agent go to a sequence of the ranked restaurants respectively on the first evening already and than shift by one rank step in the in the next evenings will automatically lead to the best optimized solution ( with @xmath5 ) .",
    "also , each one gets in turn to the best ranked restaurant ( with periodicity @xmath0 ) .",
    "the process starts from the first evening itself .",
    "it is hard to find a strategy in kpr , where each agent decides independently ( democratically ) based on past experience and information , to achieve this even after long learning time .",
    "let the strategy chosen by each agent in the kpr game be such that , at any time @xmath1 , the probability @xmath6 to arrive at the @xmath2-th ranked restaurant is given by    @xmath7 } , \\ \\",

    ", the agents avoid those restaurants visited last evening and choose again randomly among the rest . for @xmath18 , and @xmath15",
    ", the game corresponds to a strictly rank - dependent choice case .",
    "we concentrate on these three special limits .",
    "for the case where @xmath14 and @xmath19 , the probability @xmath6 becomes independent of @xmath2 and becomes qeuivalent to @xmath20 . for simulation",
    "we take @xmath21 restaurant and @xmath21 agents and on each evening @xmath1 an agent selects any restaurant with equal probability @xmath22 .",
    "all averages have been made for @xmath23 time steps .",
    "we study the variation of probability @xmath24 of the agents getting dinner versus their fraction @xmath3 .",

    "[ fig:1 ] shows that @xmath24 is again a gaussian and that its maximum occurs at @xmath31 .",
    "in this case an agent chooses randomly among those restaurents which went vacant in the previous evening : with probability @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 , one gets @xmath35 for @xmath2 values for which @xmath36 and @xmath37 for other values of @xmath2 where @xmath38 is the number of vacant restaurants in time @xmath9 . for numerical studies we again take @xmath26 and average the statistics over @xmath23 time steps . in the fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , the gaussian distribution @xmath24 of restaurant utilization fraction @xmath3 is shown .",
    "the average utilization fraction @xmath27 is seen to be around @xmath39 .",
    "suppose there are @xmath40 agents and @xmath0 restaurants .",
    "an agents can select any restaurant with equal probability .",
    "therefore , the probability that a single restaurant is chosen by @xmath41 agents is given by a poission distribution in the limit @xmath42 : @xmath43 therefore the fraction of restaurants not chosen by any agents is given by @xmath44 and that implies that average fraction of restaurants occupied on any evening is given by @xcite    @xmath45    in the kpr problem .",
    "the distribution of the fraction of utilization will be gaussian around this average .      in this case",
    ", an agent goes to the @xmath2-th ranked restaurant with probability @xmath46 ; that is , @xmath6 given by ( [ general ] ) in the limit @xmath18 , @xmath47 .",
    "starting with @xmath0 restaurants and @xmath0 agents , we make @xmath48 pairs of restaurants and each pair has restaurants ranked @xmath2 and @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , an agent chooses any pair of restaurant with uniform probability @xmath51 or @xmath0 agents chooses randomly from @xmath48 pairs of restaurents .",
    "therefore the fraction of pairs selected by the agents ( from eq .",
    "( [ eq : poisson_mm ] ) )    @xmath52    also , the expected number of restaurants occupied in a pair of restaurants with rank @xmath2 and @xmath49 by a pair of agents is @xmath53 therefore , the fraction of restaurants occupied by pairs of agents @xmath54 hence , the actual fraction of restaurants occupied by the agents is    @xmath55    again , this compares well with the numerical observation of the most probable distribution position ( see figs .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "we consider here the case where each agent chooses on any evening ( @xmath1 ) randomly among the restaurants in which nobody had gone in the last evening ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "this correspond to the case where @xmath56 and @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ general ] ) .",
    "our numerical simulation results for the distribution @xmath24 of the fraction @xmath3 of utilized restaurants is again gaussian with a most probable peak at @xmath57 ( see figs .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "this can be explained in the following way : as the fraction @xmath27 of restaurants visited by the agents in the last evening is avoided by the agents this evening , the number of available restaurants is @xmath58 for this evening and is chosen randomly by all the @xmath0 agents .",
    "hence , when fitted to eq .",
    "( [ eq : poisson_mm ] ) , @xmath59 . therefore , following eq .",
    "( [ eq : poisson_mm ] ) , we can write the equation for @xmath27 as    @xmath60    solution of this equation gives @xmath57 .",
    "this result agrees well with the numerical results for this limit ( see figs .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] ; @xmath14 , @xmath34 ) .",
    "we consider here a game where @xmath0 agents ( prospective customers ) attempt to choose every evening @xmath61 from @xmath0 equally priced ( hence no budget consideration for any individual agent is important ) restaurants ( each capable of serving only one ) having well - defined ranking @xmath2 ( @xmath62 ) , agreed by all the agents .",
    "the decissions on every evening ( @xmath1 ) are made by each agent independently , based on the informations about the rank @xmath2 of the restaurants and their past popularity given by @xmath63 in general .",
    "we consider here cases where each agent chooses the @xmath2-th ranked restaurant with probability @xmath6 given by eq .",
    "( [ general ] ) .",
    "the utilization fraction @xmath3 of those restaurants on every evening is studied and their distributions @xmath24 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] for some special cases . from numerical studies ,",
    "we find their distributions to be gaussian with the most probable utilization fraction @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath39 for the cases with @xmath14 , @xmath19 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath14 , @xmath34 respectively .",
    "the analytical estimates for @xmath27 in these limits are also given and they agree very well with the numerical observations .    the kpr problem ( see also the kolkata restaurant problem @xcite ) has , in principle , a ` trivial ' solution ( dictated from outside ) where each agent gets into one of the respective restaurant ( full utilization with @xmath66 ) starting on the first evening and gets the best possible sharing of their ranks as well when each one shifts to the next ranked restaurant ( with the periodic boundary ) in the successive evenings .",
    "however , this can be extremely difficult to achieve in the kpr game , even after long trial time , when each agent decides parallelly ( or democratically ) on their own , based on past experience and information regarding the history of the entire system of agents and restaurants .",
    "the problem becomes truly difficult in the @xmath42 limit .",
    "the kpr problem has similarity with the minority game problem @xcite as in both the games , herding behavior is punished and diversity s encouraged .",
    "also , both involves learning of the agents from the past successes etc .",
    "of course , kpr has some simple exact solution limits , a few of which are discussed here . in none of these cases , considered here ,",
    "learning strategies are individualistic ; rather all the agents choose following the probability given by eq .",
    "( [ general ] ) . in a few different limits of such a learning strategy ,",
    "the average utilization fraction @xmath27 and their distributions are obtained and compared with the analytic estimates , which are reasonably close .",
    "needless to mention , the real challenge is to design algorithms of learning mixed strategies ( e.g. , from the pool discussed here ) by the agents so that the simple ` dictated ' solution emerges eventually even when every one decides on the basis of their own information independently .",
