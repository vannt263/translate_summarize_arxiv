    "dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) was developed over the past 15 years into a powerful tool for the treatment of strongly correlated electron systems  @xcite .",
    "dmft is based on the idea of mapping a complicated lattice model onto a single impurity model coupled to a noninteracting bath .",
    "it relies on the observation that the self energy @xmath2 becomes @xmath3-independent in infinite dimensions @xmath4  @xcite , making a single site treatment with only temporal fluctuation exact in this limit .",
    "the dmft approach derives its strength from the fact that it becomes exact in this nontrivial limit of @xmath4 or infinite lattice coordination .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , dmft proves to be a very good approximation even in @xmath5 dimensions . by replacing complicated models with a single impurity model , the dmft equations",
    "can then be solved with one of the methods that have been developed to solve the anderson impurity model .",
    "the study of correlated materials has until a few years ago been conducted with two approaches that are very different in spirit . on the one hand ,",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) calculations in the local density approximation ( lda ) has proven invaluable in the determination of the electronic structure of real materials but there are a number of strongly correlated materials where its predictions are even in qualitative disagreement with experiment . on the other hand ,",
    "the study of model hamiltonians has provided qualitative understanding of may systems with strong correlations but due to its dependence on parameters this method lacks predictive power for new materials .",
    "the combination of the two approaches in the form of lda+dmft  @xcite promises to deepen our understanding of strongly correlated materials as some initial successes demonstrate  @xcite .",
    "dmft reduces the quantum many body problem to a single site problem , namely an impurity model in a medium , and requires the solution of an anderson impurity model for arbitrary values of the bath .",
    "when the lda+dmft is carried out self - consistently in a multiband situation , the impurity model has to be solved many times , and becomes the bottleneck of the lda+dmft algorithm .",
    "therefore it is important to find impurity solvers that are reliable and computationally cheap .",
    "currently , the usual choices for solving the anderson impurity model in the framework of lda+dmft are quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) , the non - crossing approximation ( nca ) , and the iterated perturbation theory ( ipt ) .",
    "nevertheless , each of these methods has some drawbacks limiting its range of applicability .",
    "the qmc method is essentially exact , but becomes prohibitively expensive at low temperatures and for high interaction strength @xmath0 .",
    "the nca approximation , applied to the impurity model , exceeds the unitarity limit at low temperatures and leads to pathologies in the solutions of the dmft equations .",
    "the extension of the ipt scheme , a method which was very successful at arbitrary filling in the one orbital situation , has encountered difficulties in its extension to the multiorbital case .",
    "this provides the motivation of this article to investigate the usefulness of a previously known decoupling scheme in the context of dmft .",
    "the method for the solution of the anderson impurity model proposed here aims at working with an arbitrary noninteracting dos as input .",
    "nevertheless , we intend to show that even for the solution of model hamiltonians like , _",
    "e.@xmath6 g . _ the hubbard hamiltonian , a dmft scheme with a closed set of equations gained from a decoupling scheme is superior to the direct solution of that hamiltonian with decoupling methods .",
    "the method of writing equations of motion ( eom ) for the anderson impurity model and decoupling them in order to close the system of equations has a long history  @xcite . in the derivation of the integral equation for the solution of the infinite @xmath0 anderson impurity model",
    "we follow the approach and the decoupling scheme of t. costi  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian for a mixed valent impurity is  @xcite @xmath7 we determine the equation of motion for the @xmath8-channel f - electron green s function ( gf ) @xmath9 by writing @xmath10_+\\rangle + { { \\langle\\!\\langle}}[x^{0m},h];x^{m0 } { { \\rangle\\!\\rangle}}\\ ] ] and evaluating the appearing ( anti- ) commutators .",
    "the result is @xmath11 assuming that the hybridization @xmath12 does not depend on the @xmath13 component @xmath8 of the angular momentum @xmath14 .",
    "the abbreviation @xmath15 was introduced .",
    "the averages over the @xmath16 operators are @xmath17 and @xmath18 where the total number of @xmath19 electrons is calculated as @xmath20 with the notation @xmath21 . for the higher order green s functions on the rhs of eq .",

    "the sums over @xmath32 and @xmath33 can be simplified further .    to that end",

    "i turns out that this set of equations on the real frequency axis is solved easily for the anderson impurity model , but as we add self consistency conditions in order to solve more complicated models in the dmft approximation , convergence depends strongly on a good initial guess of the solution . for this purpose",
    ", we write equations analogous to eqs .  , , and on the matsubara axis .",
    "matsubara greens functions are much more smooth than their counterparts on the real frequency axis and thus converge more easily .",
    "nevertheless , the calculation of the greens function on the imaginary axis does not make the real axis calculation redundant : firstly , the analytic continuation to the real axis is only accurate for low frequencies due to a lack of high frequency information in the matsubara greens function .",
    "secondly , the dependence of the imaginary frequency grid on temperature @xmath44 means that at high temperatures , the low frequency part of the greens function is very badly resolved , while at very low temperatures , an inordinate number of imaginary frequencies is necessary to describe the greens function for all frequencies for which it significantly differs from zero .",
    "this means that from a practical point of view , the matsubara greens function is best calculated at an intermediate temperature , providing via analytic continuation a sufficiently accurate initial guess for the iterative solution of eq .   on the real axis",
    "this problem of the matsubara formulation is not related to the well known difficulty in performing analytic continuation to the real axis .",
    "all equations of motion are almost unchanged when we go over to matsubara frequency @xmath45 , _",
    "e.@xmath6 g . _",
    ".   becomes @xmath46 correlations have to be calculated as @xmath47 which replaces eq .",
    "for that purpose . in order to simplify the equations , we employ the analog of eq .",
    ", namely @xmath48 and we identify occurrences of the hybridization function @xmath49 this leads to the system of equations @xmath50 with @xmath51 with the replacement @xmath52 we can easily recover eqs .   and from and .",
    "it is important to note that good convergence of the self - consistent solution of the system of equations depends crucially on the proper treatment of the slowly decaying high frequency tails of the addends of eqs .  - .",
    "a high frequency expansion of these addends was performed to determine the coefficients of the terms proportional to @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "these terms were subtracted from the sums , and their value was determined analytically .",
    "we now proceed to investigate the usefulness of the impurity solver detailed above in its application in the dmft context .",

    "it is not the intention of this article to go into detail for each of the three models .",
    "we first investigate the hubbard model in order to study the quasiparticle scaling of the hubbard band with degeneracy @xmath55 .",
