    "white dwarfs ( wds ) are the final endpoint of stellar evolution for the vast majority of stars .",
    "wds are gaining importance in tracing the history of stellar populations in the galaxy , including the galactic disk ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , open star clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , and globular star clusters @xcite .",
    "wds are also useful in studies of supernova physics , as the upper mass of wd progenitors represents the critical progenitor mass ( @xmath0 ) , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 for core - collapse supernovae .",
    "the value of @xmath0is relatively uncertain , with the best estimates of @xmath3 .",
    "the first significant population of white dwarfs ( wds ) in open clusters was identified by @xcite in the , , and the .",
    "@xcite compared the number of hyades wds to the estimated number of hyades stars having completed their lifetimes .",
    "her work found that the wd numbers are compatible with @xmath4 , though this determination depends sensitively on the assumed initial - mass function ( imf ) , the turnoff mass of the hyades , and the hyades distance modulus .",
    "this value of @xmath0is lower than current lower limits ( @xmath5 ) , set in large part by the existence of , the lone wd in the ( turnoff mass @xmath6 ) .",
    "@xcite discuss the hyades wd population and determine a deficit of 21 wds ( 28 wds predicted versus 7 observed wds ) for @xmath7 and ascribe this white dwarf deficit to dynamical evaporation of wds from the hyades .",
    "similar deficits of wds have since been observed in other open clusters , including @xcite , ( claver et al .",
    "2001 , hereafter @xcite ) , and @xcite .",
    "the existence of the white dwarf deficit is still debatable , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "three explanations for the white dwarf deficit in open clusters readily come to mind .",
    "first , wds may evaporate from open clusters due to dynamical evolution .",
    "mass segregation and galactic tidal fields alone are not sufficient to remove wds from open clusters , as a 0.6@xmath8wd is still more massive than typical cluster stars and thus unlikely to suffer preferential evaporation .",
    "this is borne out by modern @xmath9-body simulations of open clusters , such as those of @xcite and @xcite , which find that wds remain bound in open clusters . however ,",
    "if a wd receives a sufficient velocity kick from asymmetric mass loss during its post - main sequence evolution , the wd may become unbound from the open cluster .",
    "this scenario was first suggested by @xcite to explain the wd deficit in the .",
    "recent , simple @xmath9-body simulations by @xcite confirm that this mechanism can preferentially remove wds from an open cluster , though scant observational evidence exists .",
    "a second explanation for the white dwarf deficit , though not exclusive of the dynamical evolutionary argument , is that the wds may be hidden in binary systems in which the intrinsically faint wds are not detected due to the overwhelming light of brighter companion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "searches for wds in binaries have been undertaken in the hyades .",
    "two of the known hyades wds , and , are in binary systems .",
    "more recently , additional hyades wds have been discovered hidden in unresolved binaries , including @xcite , @xcite , and four potential wds in am binary star systems @xcite .",
    "clearly some wds lie hidden in unresolved binary systems , but the exact numbers are not known .    the third explanation for the small number of white dwarfs seen in the hyades and other well studied young clusters could be that our expectations of wd numbers are incorrect .",
    "the deficit discussed for the hyades would go away if @xmath0is low ( @xmath10 ) , if the imf for masses above the cluster turnoff mass is steeper than the present - day mass function around the turnoff mass , or a combination of these two effects .",
    "the low value of @xmath0seems unlikely , given that wds have been observed in clusters with turnoff masses higher than 4@xmath8 , including the pleiades , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have developed a monte carlo method of calculating the number of wds detectable in observations of specific open clusters , a calculation designed to aid in the interpretation of data from the lick - arizona white dwarf survey ( lawds , * ? ? ? * ) and could be used in conjunction with other ongoing cluster wd surveys , such as the cfht open cluster survey @xcite and the wiyn open cluster study @xcite .",
    "this calculation utilizes the observed characteristics of specific open clusters , including the cluster age , distance and reddening , and determines how many wds would be detected given photometric wd selection criteria .",
    "the structure of this calculation , its limitations , and tests of the calculation are presented in  2 . in ",
    "3 we present the results of the calculations for the hyades , praesepe , and the pleiades and compare these results to the observed wd populations . in",
    "4 we discuss the results and discuss the usefulness of these calculations in regard to current searches for wds in open clusters .",
    "the number of wds detectable by photometric observations of open clusters can be calculated by appropriate modeling of the cluster , including the effects of unresolved binary stars , choice of imf , wd detection criteria , @xmath0 , metallicity and cluster age .",
    "assuming that such an open cluster model is sufficiently realistic , any significant difference between the calculated numbers of observable wds and the actual numbers of observed wds represents the `` true '' white dwarf deficit that must be explained by other means , such as evaporation or other dynamical evolution .",
    "monte carlo techniques are used to calculate the observable wd population .",
    "stars are randomly drawn from an input imf .",
    "for this work , four input imfs @xmath11 were considered : a salpeter imf with @xmath12 @xcite , a steeper power law that accounts for unresolved binary systems with @xmath13 @xcite , and a broken power law with a flat low - mass slope : @xmath14 @xcite , hereafter called the `` naylor imf , '' and the kroupa imf with @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "stars are assigned a binary companion with a probability based on an input binary fraction ; the binary mass fraction is assumed to be random , i.e. the primary and secondary stars are drawn from the same imf ( see  [ limitations ] below ) .",
    "the stars are then evolved to the input cluster age using the @xmath16 or @xmath17 solar - scaled metallicity stellar evolutionary models of @xcite .",
    "these models provide evolutionary data on stars with masses up to 20@xmath8 , sufficiently massive to explore all likely values of @xmath0 .",
    "two outcomes are assumed for stars having completed their evolution .",
    "stars with @xmath18 undergo supernovae .",
    "stars with @xmath19 form a wd .",
    "the wd mass is determined from a linear approximation of the initial - final mass relation in @xcite , @xmath20 each wd is assigned a cooling age equivalent to the progenitor lifetime subtracted from the input cluster age .",
    "the radii , effective temperature , and surface gravities of each wd are interpolated from the carbon / oxygen models of wood ( 1995 , hereafter @xcite ) .",
    "photometric indices for each system are determined by summation of the flux from each component .",
    "supernova remnants are assumed to emit no flux .",
    "wd fluxes are determined from the updated model atmospheres of @xcite graciously provided by d. koester .",
    "stellar fluxes are taken from the isochrones of @xcite for the @xcite evolutionary models .",
    "these indices are corrected for the input distance modulus and reddening , assuming the interstellar reddening law of @xcite and @xmath21 .    once the photometric indices for each system have been calculated , these indices are compared to the input wd photometric - selection criteria .",
    "these criteria include color indices and single - band magnitude limits , with the intention that the photometric criteria used to select wd candidates in actual observations of a given cluster are used in the simulation of that cluster .",
    "if a system meets these input photometric selection criteria , the number of detected wds is incremented by one . if it fails to meet the selection criteria , the wd is considered undetected .",
    "the monte carlo calculation continues to select stellar systems until the number of stars brighter than a limiting magnitude @xmath22 reaches the input value . for example , if the cumulative luminosity function of an actual open cluster has @xmath23 stars brighter than @xmath22 , then each simulated cluster will also contain @xmath23 stars brighter than @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath24 realization of each cluster are used to ensure high precision in the output .",
    "these calculations represent a simplified version of actual open clusters .",
    "the simulation assumes that all binary stars are unresolved , an assumption whose validity depends strongly on the cluster distance and the distribution of physical separations among binary stars .",
    "binary interactions during stellar evolution , such as mass transfer systems , common envelope stages , cataclysmic variables , and the potential disruption of binaries due to mass loss are ignored .",
    "open cluster dynamical evolution , such as evaporation of stars and evolution of the binary fraction , is also ignored .",
    "the binary mass ratios are assumed to be random , which is likely not be the case for close binaries , but is reasonable for wider binaries @xcite . finally , stellar systems with more than two components are not considered .    ignoring binary - star evolution and the different mass ratios of close binaries than a random imf results in far fewer double - degenerate systems being created than as seen in realistic @xmath9-body simulations , such as the significant double - degenerate population seen in @xcite .",
    "the presence of any observed double - degenerate sequence in an open cluster therefore can provide a constraint on the relative importance of close - binary evolution in open clusters .",
    "the lack of consideration of dynamical evolution is not a deficiency in the calculations , but rather is one purpose of these calculations  to determine the actual number of missing wds that dynamical evolution must be invoked to explain .",
    "the strong , observed evaporation of low - mass stars has no great impact on this calculation .",
    "low - mass stars in binaries with a ( comparatively ) high - mass wd should not be affected greatly by evaporation processes , and low - mass stars not in a binary system with a wd are not used in the calculation beyond the initial selection of cluster stars .    in short , these calculations are not a simulation of wds in the larger sense of open cluster evolution .",
    "rather , this calculation provides a more sophisticated means of comparing the observed wd populations of specific open clusters to the expected observable wd population . any differences between the actual observed wd population and the calculated observable population",
    "provide a measure of the strength of the dynamical evolution of the wd population .",
    "we ran numerous tests to verify that these calculations return reasonable results for certain limiting cases .",
    "[ fig.plot_imf ] shows the output imf of a single simulated cluster with 5000 stars more massive than 1@xmath8for each of the input imfs . as one would hope , the output imfs agree with the input imfs",
    ".    simulated clusters with a @xmath13 power - law or the naylor imf are found to contain fewer wds than those with a salpeter or kroupa imf , merely due to the fact that fewer high - mass stars formed due to the steeper slope .",
    "the naylor and kroupa imfs result in a higher fraction of wds being hidden in binary systems than the single power - law imfs due to the relatively flat low - mass imf slope , as a companion to a wd is more likely to be higher mass and therefore more luminous than the wd .",
    "[ fig.plot_ages ] shows output color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) for calculations of clusters at four different ages containing no binary stars .",
    "occasional minor numerical issues arise during the interpolation of photometric indices for evolved stars due to the large changes in magnitudes with minute changes in stellar mass .",
    "these issues arise primarily at inflection points in the isochrones , such at the helium flash and at the tip of the agb .",
    "these errors do not affect the simulated detection of wds , as both the correct and erroneous magnitudes for these stars are bright enough to hide any wd companions , and the number of stars affected is very small .",

    "the wd - ms binaries , which would blend in with background disk ms stars in a @xmath27 cmd , are well - separated from the locus of main - sequence in color - color space .",
    "in addition , the color - color space information clearly separates the wd cooling sequence from massive ms stars .",

    "multiple ( @xmath24 ) realizations of each cluster are used to calculate precise means and standard deviations for various categories of wds , including the total number of wds , the total observed number of wds , the number of wds in binary systems , etc .",
    "we have calculated the predicted observed wd populations for three open clusters : the hyades , the praesepe , and the pleiades .",

    "the calculated numbers of wds in each cluster fulfilling various criteria , including whether the wd met the photometric selection criteria ( these are given individually for each cluster below ) , whether a wd was in a binary system , and wd progenitor masses were calculated , and the mean and standard deviation of each over the ensemble of trials were calculated .",
    "the standard deviations are found to be nearly equal to those expected from poisson statistics .",
    "therefore , we use poisson statistics to compare the calculated populations to observations of the actual cluster wds .",

    "the calculations consistently over - predict the number of observed , color - selected wds and the number of color - selected wds in binary systems .",
    "however , the discrepancy between the expected number of wds and the observed number is lower than in previous observational studies due to the inclusion of binaries in the simulation .",
    "therefore , preferential evaporation of wds from these clusters due to dynamical evolution need not be as severe as suggested by @xcite but can not be ruled out .",
    "it should also be noted that the binary fractions used in this work represent the high end of the range of commonly - quoted cluster binary populations . a lower actual binary fraction would result in a larger wd deficit .",
    "the number of observed wds can be brought into agreement with the calculated numbers via at least four different methods .",

    "second , the binary fractions may be higher , resulting in more wds being hidden in unresolved binaries .",
    "third , the binary mass ratio could be closer to unity than the random parings discussed here , which would result in more binary wds being hidden in systems .",
    "fourth , some sort of dynamical evolution may be removing wds from the open clusters .",
    "from the simulation alone , it is not possible to differentiate between these scenarios .",
    "as mentioned above , the lack of observed wds in the hyades and praesepe with progenitor masses @xmath69 is inconsistent with the calculated populations .",
    "a steeper high - mass imf would explain the lack of these wds , as would dynamical evolution . however , there is some evidence that binary stars in this mass range tend to have a fairly flat distribution of mass ratios , especially for orbital periods @xmath70 @xcite",
    ". if this is true , wds with massive progenitors may be more likely to be in binary systems with massive , unevolved stars than in binary systems with fainter , low - mass stars , and therefore more likely to go undetected .",
    "there are several avenues of research which could shed some light on these issues .",
    "first , systematic , thorough searches for wd - mass companions to stars in the hyades and praesepe are needed to complete the census of wds in each cluster , thereby determining whether or not binary systems can account for the majority of `` missing '' wds in open clusters .",
    "such a survey could include a combination of spectroscopic and high - resolution imaging ( e.g. speckle and adaptive optics surveys ) of these clusters , such as those published in @xcite and similar surveys .",
    "these surveys could also determine if the binary mass ratios for any close binaries are non - random , as opposed to the random ratios assumed in this work .",
    "also , wd searches in open clusters of a wide range of ages , such as the lawds survey we are currently undertaking , can provide evidence as to whether the deficit of massive wds is increasing with time , as would be expected for dynamical evolution .",
    "in addition , detailed comparisons of clusters of similar ages but differing compactness and richness should also show differences in the white dwarf deficit if dynamical evolution of the wd population is significant",
    ".    the calculations presented here will be useful in interpreting data from the wd observational programs .",
    "most importantly , the calculations permit us to estimate how strong the white dwarf deficit is in a cluster , given basic assumptions about the imf and binary fraction .",
    "this provides a better estimate on the significance of any apparent deficit and the cluster - to - cluster variations in the deficit than could be gleaned from simpler wd population estimators , such as simple integration of the imf .",
