    "they showed that the pitch of the spiral is proportional to the hole concentration @xmath9 , see also ref .",
    "the idea that the spiral state is the ground state of the doped heisenberg antiferromagnet attracted the attention of theorists @xcite , however the question of stability of the state remained controversial . according to refs .",
    "@xcite the spiral state is unstable toward a local enhancement of the spiral pitch . on the other hand the analysis of ref",
    "@xcite indicated that the spiral state is stable .",
    "a semiclassical analysis of stability of the ( 1,0 ) spiral state was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite . according to this analysis",
    "the state is marginal ( zero stiffness ) , which effectively indicates that the state is unstable . a complete stability analysis of spiral states in the hubbard model was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite also using the semiclassical approximation . according to their analysis in the leading in powers of doping approximation",
    "the ( 1,1 ) spiral is always unstable and the ( 1,0 ) spiral is always marginal in agreement with @xcite .",
    "recently the interest in the spiral state was renewed because of the strong experimental indications that at small doping the cuprates behave as spin glasses or even exhibit some kind of magnetic ordering .",
    "a summary of the available experimental data on one of the superconducting cuprates , la@xmath10sr@xmath11cuo@xmath12 , is given in ref .",
    "the data also show that magnetic ordering and superconductivity coexist .",
    "the spin glass behavior is consistent with the spiral scenario : since doping is not uniform the pitch of the spiral is varying from point to point and hence on large scales it leads to spin glass behavior @xcite .    in the present work we analyse the stability of spiral states within the rpa approximation .",
    "the approximation is parametrically justified for @xmath1 . in this part of the work on the technical side",
    "we follow the approach developed by igarashi and fulde @xcite . however ,",
    "contrary to them and in agreement with refs .",
    "@xcite , we conclude that in the `` pure '' @xmath7 model ( @xmath2 ) the spiral state is unstable with respect to a local enhancement of the spiral pitch .",
    "we find that relatively small values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 stabilize the spiral order , with a uniform hole distribution .",
    "our results are then consistent with numerical ( dmrg ) results indicating that inhomogeneous ( striped ) phases disappear with the increase of further - neighbor hoppings @xcite . in our approach the instability of the spiral",
    "is closely related to the fact that the hole dispersion is almost degenerate along the face of the magnetic brillouin zone .",
    "as soon as the degeneracy is sufficiently lifted by @xmath3 and @xmath4 the instability disappears , leading to a stable ( 1,0 ) spiral state . within the semiclasical approximation",
    "the effective stiffness of this state is zero in agreement with @xcite .",
    "however spin quantum fluctuations give rise to a nonzero positive stiffness and hence favor stability via an `` order from disorder '' mechanism .",
    "for parameter values corresponding to real cuprates , the pitch of the spiral is proportional to doping , and at @xmath5 the spiral becomes commensurate with the lattice with period 8 , in agreement with the experimental data of tranquada _",

    "@xcite it was shown , under the assumption that neel order is preserved under doping , that in the @xmath7 model there is spin - wave mediated superconducting pairing in all waves except the s - wave .",
    "the pairing was found to be maximum in the d - wave channel .",
    "a numerical calculation performed in ref.@xcite under the same assumption showed that the pairing was quite strong .",
    "however , the picture of pairing @xcite was not consistent because the staring point of the analysis was the ( unstable ) neel background . in the present paper , after proving the stability of the spiral state , we consider superconducting pairing on this state . using an approach similar to that of ref.@xcite we find a superconducting pairing instability and show that the gap always has lines of nodes along @xmath6 directions .",
    "we estimate analytically the lower limit for the superconducting gap .",
    "one can not classify the gap according to the lattice symmetry representations since the symmetry is spontaneously broken by the spiral .",
    "in essence the method we use is chiral perturbation theory which allows the treatment of strong interactions and is exact in the long wave - length limit @xcite .",
    "the small parameter of the approach is doping near half filling , @xmath1 .",
    "we can not determine reliably whether @xmath13 , @xmath14 or @xmath15 is sufficiently small to justify our calculations , but we claim that at sufficiently small @xmath9 only the long range dynamics is important and the approach is parametrically justified .",
    "the analysis of pairing within the chiral perturbation theory by construction complies with the adler relation @xcite and hence with the argument presented by schrieffer @xcite concerning pairing via exchange of goldstone excitations .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ neel ]",
    "we calculate the single hole dispersion and the quasiparticle residue for different values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",

    "however there exists an additional contribution to pairing ( not accounted for in the solution ( [ sol ] ) ) which can be estimated already in the weak - coupling limit .",
    "this involves pairing via the upper @xmath200-band ( ghost band ) and can be included by replacing the many - body wave function ( [ bcs ] ) by : @xmath201 to account for this effect we calculate the second order correction to the spin - wave mediated interaction ( [ paird ] ) between the @xmath137-fermions .",

    "the most important pairing enhancement is expected from the renormalization of the spin - wave green s function , to be discussed in a separate work .",
    "we have studied the phase diagram of the @xmath0 model close to half - filling . to determine the single hole properties ( one hole injected in an antiferromagnetic background ) we use the self consistent born approximation .",
    "this approximation is not parametrically justified for the @xmath7 model , but it is known that it works remarkably well for the single hole properties .",
    "the crucial observation is that these properties are not related to the long range dynamics : all integrals in momentum space are convergent at large momenta ( quantum fluctuations at distances 1 - 2 lattice spacings ) .",
    "finite doping brings nontrivial long - range dynamics into the problem . to determine the dynamics we use the chiral perturbation theory which involves an expansion in powers of doping near half filling , @xmath1 .",
    "the efficiency of the chiral perturbation theory is in essence a consequence of the dimensionality of the problem ( 2 + 1 d ) and goldstone s theorem .",
    "we certainly can not determine the exact value of doping so that it is small enough to justify the approach , but we claim that at sufficiently small @xmath9 the approach is parametrically justified .",
    "we show that the neel state is unstable with respect to decay to spiral states as soon as doping is introduced .",
    "the analysis of the stability of the spiral phases is performed within the rpa approximation , and all non - rpa corrections are suppressed by powers of @xmath9 .",
    "we find that at @xmath2 the spiral state is unstable toward a local enhancement of the spiral pitch , and consequently at that point the nature of the true ground state remains unclear .",
    "however we have shown that for values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 corresponding to real cuprates the ( 1,0 ) spiral state is stable .",
    "the phase diagram of the model at @xmath67 ( we set @xmath30 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . for hole concentration",
    "@xmath5 the ( 1,0 ) spiral is commensurate with the lattice with a period of 8 lattice spacings , in agreement with experimental data .",
    "[ fig7a ] shows the dependence of the spiral on - site magnetization on doping .",
    "we demonstrate that spin - wave mediated superconductivity is developed above the spiral state and derive analytically a lower limit for the superconducting gap .",
    "one can not classify the gap according to the lattice representations a@xmath221 , a@xmath32 , b@xmath221 , b@xmath32 , and e ( `` s'',d,p  , ... ) since the symmetry of the lattice is spontaneously broken by the spiral .",
    "however , the gap always has lines of nodes and a symmetry similar to d - wave .",
    "finally we briefly discuss the possible connection of our results to experiments in the cuprates .",
    "magnetic order has been observed in the superconducting states of both la@xmath222nd@xmath223sr@xmath11cuo@xmath224 @xcite and la@xmath10sr@xmath11cuo@xmath224 @xcite .",
    "this order seems to be particularly enhanced near the hole concentration @xmath225 where a commensurate structure with a period of 8 lattice spacings is observed .",
    "in addition , static charge order ( with a period 4 ) has been observed at least in one of the materials @xcite .",
    "this has lead to proposals that the state near @xmath225 is a collinear spin density wave ( sdw ) coexisting with a charge density wave ( cdw ) at twice the wave vector @xcite .",
    "such an interpretation of experiments rules out a non collinear spiral configuration of the type shown in fig .",
    "[ 45spiral ] , since the density of holes is expected to be uniform in the spiral case . on the other hand the question whether ( static ) charge order is a generic feature of the cuprates is far from being resolved and experiments in many cuprates are interpreted as showing fluctuating ( i.e. dynamic ) order in the charge sector @xcite . for example",
    "the existence of ( static ) charge order in la@xmath10sr@xmath11cuo@xmath224 is far less clear @xcite although it also exhibits commensurate magnetic peaks around @xmath225 .    in the light of the above we find our result that the spiral ( 1,0 ) state is commensurate with the lattice ( period 8 , fig .",
    "( [ 45spiral ] ) ) for @xmath226 very promising .",
    "it seems to be consistent with the data in the magnetic sector ( although the interpretation of ref .",
    "@xcite rules out a spiral state in that material ) .",
    "moreover , it is known that doping introduces disorder , in turn leading to glassy features in the magnetism ; at least at low doping ( in the normal state ) those features can be explained well within the spiral scenario @xcite . in our opinion",
    "it would be also very interesting to study the density response of the system in the spiral state .",
    "in the context of the @xmath7 model the density response has been recently investigated in the neel state @xcite , where fluctuations at energies of order @xmath218 were found . in a spiral state , due to the presence of the ghost ( empty ) band",
    ", we expect that even lower energy charge density fluctuations will exist , although a perfectly static cdw order seems impossible to stabilize .",
    "it is certainly more likely that some kind of order in the charge sector appears ( if anywhere at all ) around the point @xmath2 , where the spiral state is inherently unstable . if we indeed interpret the region marked as `` unstable '' on our phase diagram fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] as a candidate for such order , then the effect of increasing @xmath3 and/or @xmath4 is to drive the system towards the ( stable ) spiral order , with a homogeneous charge distribution .",
    "this occurs for @xmath227 ( at @xmath228 ) . from this point of view",
    "our results are similar , at least superficially , to the dmrg results describing the destruction of stiped phases by second - neighbor hopping @xcite , where a critical value of @xmath3 necessary to destabilize the stripes was found , and is quite close to our estimate above . + we acknowledge discussions with j. haase , g. khaliullin , p. horsch , c. bernhard , and s. sachdev . an important part of this work was done during the stay of one of us ( o.p.s . ) at the max - planck - institute fur festkorperforschung , stuttgart .",
