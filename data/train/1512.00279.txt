    "<S> nevertheless , the nne correction to single - inclusive gluon production is seen not to exhibit nuclear enhancement since it involves the color correlation scale @xmath21 rather than the target thickness @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> this occurs because the gluon field of the target is evaluated at a longitudinal coordinate @xmath30 in the amplitude , and @xmath31 in the conjugate amplitude which may differ at most by @xmath21 .    </S>",

    "<S> in summary , in this paper we have evaluated explicitly wilson lines with electric field insertions to leading order in the field @xmath22 of the target . </S>",

    "<S> we have derived a @xmath0-factorization formula valid up to nne accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> for single inclusive gluon production we find that sub - eikonal corrections cancel if a model with local ( in the longitudinal coordinate @xmath19 ) color charge correlator for the target is employed . on the other hand such corrections should be present in models with color charge correlators with finite support . furthermore , nne eikonal corrections also appear in correlated two gluon production , even for a local target color charge correlator . rather than simply rescaling the two - gluon cross section we find that nne corrections depend on the type of contractions of the sources in the target . </S>",
