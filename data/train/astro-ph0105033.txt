    "the x - rays reprocessed on accretion disks to the optical , uv and x - ray bands in both x - ray binaries and agn could be one of our best probes of accretion disk structure and the environment around compact objects .",
    "it is convenient to study an illuminated disk around neutron star low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) since the central continuum dominates the energetics of the disk atmosphere and accretion disk corona ( adc ) , and the system geometry is often determined .",
    "measurements of the optical magnitudes and lightcurve amplitudes of lmxb yielded estimates of the angle subtended by the disk of @xmath0 12@xmath1 and of the average fraction of x - rays reprocessed by the disk into the optical of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "models that seem to correctly describe the accretion disk interior have been unable to produce disk geometries consistent with the optical data @xcite .",
    "analytical models assuming an isothermal disk show better agreement with the data , yet produce illuminated disks that are significantly thinner than expected @xcite .",
    "a pure continuum incident on the gaseous disk will photoionize and heat the gas .",
    "radiative heating sustains a @xmath3 k adc and a smaller @xmath4-@xmath5 k atmosphere emitting x - ray lines on top of the optically thick disk .",
    "x - ray spectra of lmxbs during dips show strong comptonized emission plus an excess flux at 0.65 kev consistent with the same covering fraction @xcite , positing that adc and disks may coexist .",
    "the apparent size of the adc and the disk may not be equal @xcite , since the emission mechanisms have different radial dependence .",
    "@xcite modeled the reprocessed continuum and fluorescence emission from the inner disk of agn with an adc , and @xcite modeled x - ray spectra of disk annuli in an lmxb with adc and normally incident radiation .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the structure of an accretion disk illuminated by the grazing radiation of a neutron star in an lmxb with a compton - temperature adc , building on a model by @xcite .",
    "this model , which we will detail in a future paper , includes a more accurate calculation of the vertical and radial disk structure than previous models , accounts for thermal instabilities , and incorporates recent atomic model calculations that predict x - ray spectra at a resolution superior to the _ chandra and _ xmm - newton spectrometers .",
    "we obtain the first self - consistent flared disk geometry that matches the disk thickness expected from optical data , and we predict that broad x - ray lines will be observable and will provide , among other diagnostics , evidence for photo - evaporation , which is central to the origin of winds @xcite . _ _",
    "we consider an lmxb with a @xmath6 @xmath7 primary radiating an eddington luminosity bremsstrahlung continuum with @xmath8 kev .",
    "we use a set of fiducial system parameters for a bright lmxb , so application to a particular source will require using the observed x - ray continuum to improve accuracy .",
    "the maximum radius of the centrally - illuminated disk is @xmath9 cm , so the orbital period @xmath10 day .",
    "the minimum radius is @xmath11 cm , below which the omitted effect of radiation pressure will dominate .",
    "we obtain the vertical disk atmosphere structure of each annulus by integrating the hydrostatic balance and 1-d radiation transfer equations for a slab geometry : @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 while satisfying local thermal equilibrium : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the pressure , @xmath17 is the density , @xmath18 is the incident radiation field , @xmath19 is the reprocessed radiation propagating down towards the disk midplane , @xmath20 the vertical distance from the midplane , @xmath21 the gravitational constant , @xmath22 the grazing angle of the radiation on the disk , @xmath23 the radius , and @xmath24 is the local absorption coefficient .",
    "the difference between heating and cooling @xmath25 includes compton scattering , bremsstrahlung cooling , photoionization heating , collisional line cooling , and recombination line cooling from h , he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca , and fe ions . we assume cosmic abundances @xcite .",
    "the code from @xcite computes the net heating and ionization equilibrium , compton scattering , and line scattering using escape probabilities .",
    "a new disk structure calculation simultaneously integrates eqs .",
    "[ eq : hydro]-[eq : rad2 ] by the runge - kutta method using an adaptive stepsize control routine with error estimation , and eq .",
    "[ eq : thermal ] is solved by a globally convergent newton s method @xcite . at the adc height @xmath26 ,",
    "the equilibrium @xmath27 is close to the compton temperature @xmath28 , from which we begin to integrate downward until @xmath29 .",
    "the optically thick part of the disk , with temperature @xmath30 , is assumed to be vertically isothermal @xcite . to get @xmath30 , we assume that the viscous energy and illumination energy is all locally radiated as blackbody radiation . that is , for @xmath31 and @xmath32 : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the neutron star radius , @xmath35 the accretion rate and luminosity , @xmath36 the stephan - boltzmann constant , and @xmath37 is the x - ray ` albedo ' derived from optical observations @xcite , such that @xmath38 is the fraction of x - rays absorbed at the photosphere . the height at which the integration ends is defined as the photosphere height @xmath39 .",
    "thus , the assumption is that for @xmath40 viscous dissipation dominates heating .",
    "the boundary conditions at the adc are set to @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , where @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath46 is the average particle mass in units of the proton mass @xmath47 .",
    "the boundary conditions at @xmath39 for @xmath18 and @xmath19 are set free , and we use the shooting method @xcite with shooting parameter @xmath48 adjusted until we satisfy @xmath49 at the photosphere .",
    "note @xmath50 is the viscosity ( @xmath51 ) dependent density calculated for an x - ray illuminated @xcite disk .",
    "we calculate @xmath52 iteratively . to get @xmath30 self - consistently from equation [ eq : locdisk ] , we need @xmath53 .",
    "we neglect the term @xmath54 , which is valid for @xmath55 cm . after an initial guess for @xmath56",
    ", we define it as the height where @xmath57 is attenuated by @xmath58 .",
    "we stop after @xmath52 and @xmath30 converge to @xmath59 % .",
    "note @xmath60 for @xmath61 . since @xmath62 is not physically determined , but it is bound by @xmath63 , we ran a second model calculating @xmath52 from @xmath39 , which we will use to estimate systematic errors due to the 1-d radiation transfer calculation .",
    "the disk atmosphere exhibits a thermally unstable region , which has direct consequences for the disk structure and x - ray spectrum .",
    "the origin of the thermal instability is well understood , and its behaviour depends on metal abundances and the local radiation spectrum @xcite .    within a range of pressure ionization parameters ( @xmath64 ) , thermal equilibrium",
    "is achieved by three distinct temperatures , only two of which are stable to perturbations in @xmath27 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "@xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the radiation pressure and @xmath67 the gas pressure @xcite .",
    "the thermally stable branches have positive slope @xcite .",
    "previous spectral studies of illuminated accretion disks in lmxb had not explicitly selected the stable solutions @xcite , a choice which affects x - ray production .",
    "the instability implies a large temperature gradient as the gas is forced to move between stable branches , requiring the formation of a transition region whose size may be determined by electron heat conduction , convection , or turbulence , depending on which dominates the heat transfer . for simplicity , we neglect emission from the transition region . upon calculation of the field length @xmath68 , the lengthscale below which conduction dominates thermal equilibrium @xcite , we estimate that conduction forms a transition layer @xmath69 times thinner than the size of the x - ray emitting zones",
    ". nevertheless , x - ray line emission from the neglected conduction region may not be negligible in all cases @xcite .",
    "conduction determines the dynamic behaviour of the gas .",
    "the dynamics will allow us to attach a physical interpretation to the chosen solutions from fig .",
    "roughly , a static conduction solution can only be found if the transition region splits the instability @xmath64-range in half ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this solution @xcite takes the low-@xmath27 stable branch at @xmath70 , and the high-@xmath27 stable branch at @xmath71 , separated by the transition layer at @xmath72 . a transition layer located away from @xmath72",
    "will dynamically approach @xmath72 by a conduction driven mass flow .",
    "a transition layer at @xmath73 is moving towards lower @xmath64 , and the gas is evaporating from the low-@xmath27 branch to the high-@xmath27 branch .",
    "a transition layer at @xmath74 is moving towards higher @xmath64 , with the gas condensing to the low-@xmath27 branch @xcite .",
    "we compute the disk structure for both condensing and evaporating solutions .",
    "we assume a steady state , condensing or evaporating mass flow through the transition layer at @xmath75 or @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "the static conduction solution is an intermediate case of the latter extreme cases .",
    "we take a single - valued @xmath77 , since a two - phase solution would be buoyantly unstable , making the denser ( colder ) gas sink .",
    "the evaporating disk corresponds to the low-@xmath27 branch , while the condensing disk corresponds to the high-@xmath27 branch ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this introduces spectral differences ( section [ sec : spec ] ) .",
    "we do not know from first principles whether the disk atmosphere is evaporating , condensing , or static .",
    "we estimate the speed of the conduction mass flow to be @xmath78 , by using the characteristic conduction time at the field length , where @xmath79 is the @xcite conductivity @xcite .",
    "we obtain a conduction mass flow speed @xmath80 which is 1 - 2@xmath81 times the local sound speed .",
    "thus , the phase dynamics will depend on the subsonic ( @xmath82 ) flow patterns in the disk atmosphere , and these flows will also determine the evaporation or condensation rates .",
    "the only physical mechanism known to transport the necessary angular momentum for disk accretion involves a magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) which drives turbulent flow in the disk @xcite .",
    "heat transfer due to this turbulent flow could quench the thermal instability and affect the disk structure .",
    "the mri also favors our assumption of vertical isothermality in the optically thick disk .",
    "with the disk structure @xmath83 , @xmath84 and ion abundances @xmath85 , we model the x - ray line emission from the disk atmosphere by using hullac ( hebrew university / lawrence livermore atomic code , @xcite ) .",
    "the code calculates the atomic structure and transition rates of radiative recombination ( rr ) and radiative recombination continuum ( rrc ) for the h - like and he - like ions of c ,",
    "n , o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca , and - .",
    "the emissivities are calculated as described in @xcite .",
    "the spectrum for each annulus is added to obtain the disk spectrum .",
    "each annulus consists of a grid of zones in the vertical @xmath86 direction , and @xmath27 , @xmath17 and @xmath87 for each zone are used to calculate the rr and rrc emissivities .",
    "the radiation is propagated outwards at inclination angle @xmath88 , including the continuum opacity of all zones above .",
    "compton scattering is not included in the calculated spectrum because it is negligible in the vertical direction in the region where the line emission is formed .",
    "the spectrum is doppler broadened by the projected local keplerian velocity , assuming azimuthal symmetry .",
    "the self - consistent disk is thicker than would be expected from the local pressure scale height @xmath89 alone .",
    "we find @xmath90 .",
    "we fit the modeled photosphere and atmosphere height , @xmath39 and @xmath62 , with @xmath91 ( @xmath23 in cm ) , with fit parameters @xmath92 and @xmath93 . we find @xmath94@xmath95 @xmath96 , @xmath97+@xmath98 , @xmath99+@xmath100 @xmath101 , @xmath102 .",
    "thus , @xmath103-@xmath104 @xmath89 and @xmath105-@xmath106+@xmath107 @xmath89 . estimated systematics are shown , if significant . @xcite",
    "estimated @xmath108 , but in spite of the steeper radial dependence , the vrtilek disk is thinner , and it equals @xmath89 for @xmath109 cm . for comparison to the optically derived disk thickness , @xmath62 is the _ de facto disk boundary , since a fraction @xmath58 of the central x - rays have been absorbed there .",
    "thus , previous theoretical studies severely underestimated the disk thickness . _    the atmosphere s ( @xmath110 ) maximum photoelectric opacity is always @xmath111 , although @xmath112 .",
    "illumination heating dominates at @xmath113 @xmath114 cm ( eq . [ eq : locdisk ] ) , where only @xmath115 of the incident photons reach @xmath39 directly , while @xmath116 reach @xmath39 after reprocessing in the atmosphere .",
    "thus , the atmospheric albedo is @xmath117 . to reproduce the disk ( atmosphere and photosphere ) albedo observed by @xcite ( @xmath118 ) , the photosphere albedo can be @xmath119 , which is a range closer to physical expectations",
    "there is no significant change in the atmosphere structure by varying @xmath51 from 1 to 0.1 .",
    "the lmxrb photon flux ( photon @xmath120 s@xmath121 kev@xmath121 ) is modeled by : @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the neutron star continuum , @xmath124 is the rr line and rrc modeled flux , @xmath125 and @xmath126 are the neutral hydrogen absorption column densities and @xmath127 are the @xcite absorption cross sections .",
    "the system is assumed to be 10 kpc away .    if we let @xmath128 in eq .",
    "[ eq : spec ] with @xmath129 , the lines are swamped by the continuum .",
    "thus , low inclination neutron star lmxbs are unlikely to have detectable x - ray lines from the disk .",
    "instead , we consider @xmath130 @xmath120 and @xmath131 @xmath120 with @xmath132 , where an obscuring medium absorbs half of the continuum flux and is compact enough to leave the disk almost unobscured .    with a partially obscured central continuum",

    "[ fig2],[fig3 ] ) .",
    "some bright lines are shown on table [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "the evaporating and condensing disks have contrasting / line ratios .",
    "the evaporating disk contains gas at @xmath133-@xmath134 k , unlike the condensing disk .",
    "the h - like ion line intensities are higher for the condensing disk since it has more gas at @xmath135 k. the spectral differences stem from the distinct differential emission measure distributions @xmath136 and from the recombination rate @xmath137 , where @xmath138-@xmath139 , @xmath140 is the emission measure , and @xmath141 are the ion and electron densities . _ _    the rrc and he - like line triplet can be used as temperature and density diagnostics , respectively .",
    "the rrc width @xmath142 @xcite .",
