    "given the non - detection , to estimate the upper limit on calvera s @xmath5-ray  flux we followed the procedure used by @xcite .",
    "in particular , we computed an expected photon index and an exponential cutoff energy using the empirical relations @xmath76 and @xmath77 , where @xmath78  g is the magnetic field at the light cylinder .",
    "this predicts @xmath79 and @xmath80 gev for calvera .",
    "we then repeated the likelihood analysis with calvera s @xmath39 and @xmath73 fixed at these values , while allowing the flux normalization to vary .",
    "based on the resulting value , the upperlimit python module from the _ fermi_science tools gives @xmath81 photons  @xmath13 s@xmath2 , translating to an energy flux of @xmath82 erg  @xmath13  s@xmath2 in the @xmath83 gev interval .",
    "the corresponding upper limit on luminosity , @xmath84 erg  s@xmath2 , is illustrated in figure  [ fig : fermi ] in comparison with detections of 88 pulsars from the second _ fermi _  large area telescope catalog of gamma - ray pulsars @xcite .",

    "two types of errors are shown for each point , involving flux and distance .",
    "usually the uncertainty in distance gives a larger error bar than the statistical uncertainty in flux .",
    "the upper limit for psr j1740 + 1000  at its nominal distance of 1.24  kpc , taken from @xcite , is also shown , as well as the upper limit for calvera for its maximum distance of 2  kpc .",
    "the luminosity of psr j1531@xmath855610 represents its pulsed emission only . ]    despite the lack of a @xmath5-ray  detection in the image plane , a search for pulsed emission is potentially more sensitive , especially if the signal is sharply peaked .",
    "accordingly , we searched for @xmath5-ray  pulsations at the position of calvera in aperture radii ranging from @xmath86 , in @xmath87 increments , for photons in both the @xmath83  gev and @xmath88  gev ranges .    lacking a true ephemeris , we searched around the approximately determined spin frequency @xmath60 and spin - down rate @xmath61 .",
    "a large grid search is necessitated by the paucity of @xmath5-ray photons , which requires a time step of at least 100 days during which phase coherence is assumed to be maintained .",
    "the number of trials was reduced by confining the range of parameters searched to a set of five possible aliases allowed by the close pair of _ chandra _  observations . in each case , conservative @xmath89 ranges in @xmath60 and @xmath61 were used to cover all plausible values . to characterize the significance of a putative signal",
    ", we used @xmath90 tests with @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",
    "we repeated the entire search using two reasonable time steps : 100 days and 365 days .",
    "finally , to maximize the sensitivity by using all the data , the power - spectra from each segment were added incoherently .",
    "no significant pulsed emission is detected in the 48 searches for each of the five trial ephemerides that account for the possible aliased x - ray solutions .",
    "this outcome is not surprising considering the small number of photons , if any , that can plausibly be attributed to calvera .",
    "the distance to calvera is poorly constrained by x - ray spectra , and is uncertain by an order of magnitude .",
    "upper limits can be derived from the effective area of thermal x - ray emission , or from the conversion of rotational energy to luminosity in the case that the x - rays are powered by rotation . scaling the values of blackbody radius in table  [ tab : spec ] with distance",
    ", a radius of @xmath93  km for the lower temperature component in the two - blackbody model corresponds to a distance upper limit of 3.6  kpc .",
    "smaller distances were derived by @xcite using hydrogen atmospheres fitted to the _ xmm - newton _  spectra , with @xmath36 fixed at the galactic value , with the result that @xmath94  kpc .",
    "here we adopt 2  kpc as an upper limit on @xmath95 because , since soft x - ray pulsations are seen , the star can not be at uniform temperature and the effective radius of emission must be smaller than @xmath96 .",
    "we adopt 200  pc as a tentative lower limit because the x - ray column density , which is better measured by the _ xmm - newton_data of @xcite , is comparable to the total galactic 21  cm value .    at @xmath97  kpc ,",
    "the x - ray luminosity of calvera would be @xmath98 erg  s@xmath2 , a typical value for thermal emission from a ns of its age , @xmath99  kyr , and consistent with theoretical ns cooling curves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . even at 200  pc ,",
    "the corresponding @xmath100 erg  s@xmath2 is not unusual , since ns temperatures are falling steeply at this age , particularly those with light - element envelopes .",
    "even some younger nss , such as rx j0007.0 + 7303 in the supernova remnant cta  1 , are seen to be this faint @xcite , which could be the effect of a larger mass .",
    "however , the ( unmeasured ) non - thermal x - ray luminosity of calvera _ would _ be exceptionally small if at @xmath101  pc , probably of order @xmath102 , while for most pulsars the ratio @xmath103 is greater than @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "calvera stands out as the most extreme case of a `` young '' pulsar at high galactic latitude , @xmath105 .",
    "its x - ray properties allow it to be nearby , in the galactic disk , or far enough to reside in the halo .",
    "if in the halo , it was either born there , or was ejected from the disk at high velocity , @xmath106  km  s@xmath2 , where @xmath107 is its height above the disk in units of 300  pc .",
    "this is near the upper limit of observed velocities of pulsars @xcite .",
    "the ejection scenario implies a proper motion @xmath108  mas  yr@xmath2 to have reached latitude @xmath105 in @xmath99  kyr . to the extent",
    "that the true age of a young pulsar is less than its characteristic age , the proper motion could be even larger .    if at a distance of @xmath109  kpc , calvera must have been born in the halo .",
    "if its progenitor was a halo star , or a runaway o or b star from the disk , then the proper motion of the ns could be up to a factor of @xmath110 smaller than indicated above , and oriented in any direction after the random supernova kick .",
    "calvera s proper motion will be measured by an approved _ chandra _  hrc observation in comparison with the original one from the year 2007 @xcite .",
    "the pulsar whose circumstances most resemble calvera s is psr j1740 + 1000 , a 0.154  s radio pulsar with @xmath111  kyr at @xmath112 and @xmath113  kpc , for which a halo or runaway progenitor scenario has also been suggested @xcite .",
    "the quoted dispersion - measure ( dm ) distance is from the australia telescope national facility catalogue @xcite , and is based on the ne2001 galactic free electron density model of @xcite . the x - ray measured column density to psr j1740 + 1000  @xcite is consistent with the galactic 21  cm value .",
    "if psr j1740 + 1000  was ejected from the galactic disk , its proper motion would have to be @xmath114  mas  yr@xmath2 .",
    "however , we can use a pair of existing _ chandra _",
    "observations to rule out this possibility directly . inspecting acis images of psr j1740 + 1000  taken in 2001 august ( obsid 1989 , 5  ks ) and 2010 june ( obsid 11250 , 64  ks ) , its centroid position is ( j2000.0 )",
    "r.a.=@xmath115 , decl.=@xmath116 , and r.a.=@xmath117 , decl.=@xmath118 , respectively . within the nominal _ chandra",
    "_  uncertainty of @xmath119 , these positions are indistinguishable from each other and from the radio timing position , r.a.=@xmath120 , decl.=@xmath121 , whose epoch is 2000 april @xcite .",
    "taking @xmath119 as an upper limit on the displacement of psr j1740 + 1000  over a 10  yr time span , this implies a proper motion of @xmath122  mas  yr@xmath2 , or a displacement of @xmath123 since birth , meaning that it was born outside of the disk if the dm distance is correct .",
    "note that this argument is independent of the possible x - ray `` tail '' of psr j1740 + 1000  @xcite , whose orientation could be interpreted as indicating motion parallel to the galactic plane . in any case",
    ", the tail may not be real , because the 64  ks _ chandra _  image of psr j1740 + 1000from 2010 does nt clearly show it .",
    "curiously , psr j1740 + 1000  is also undetected in @xmath5-rays  by _ fermi _ , as we discuss in section 4.4 .",
    "the place of calvera among the families of nss is still not clear despite our measurement of its spin and spectral properties . of the previously hypotheses , we can now rule out only a mildly recycled pulsar , as calvera lies far above the spin - up limit in figure  [ fig : ppdot ] .",
    "its dipole field of @xmath124  g is on the low end for ordinary rotation - powered pulsars of the same characteristic age , but is not unprecedented .",
    "it is difficult to characterize its true ( thermal ) age using theoretical cooling curves , first , because such curves vary , depending on several unknown parameters .",
    "its x - ray emitting hot spot(s ) do not represent the full surface area of the ns .",
    "third , it is entirely possible that some of the thermal emission is due to polar cap heating by backflowing magnetospheric particles @xcite .",
    "a typical ratio @xmath125 attributed to this process is seen in thermally emitting millisecond pulsars , and calvera s ratio is no larger than this .    even at the adopted upper - bound distance of @xmath126  kpc ,",
    "spin - down power could explain all of calvera s emission .",
    "the pulsed light curves exhibit a pronounced increase in pulsed fraction with increasing energy ( see figure  [ fig : pulse ] ) , which is characteristic of localized heating or enhanced conduction from the interior , either of which are expected at the magnetic poles of a ns .",
    "preliminary modeling suggests that the pulse profiles as a function of energy can be fitted assuming two roughly antipodal hot spots differing in temperature by a factor of two",
    ". a weak , non - thermal spectral component may be present above 2  kev , as is seen in many radio pulsars with predominantly thermal spectra , but the photon statistics of the existing data are not sufficient to distinguish it .",
    "calvera is of particular interest as the first proposed candidate for an `` orphaned cco '' that remains after the host supernova remnant dissipates @xcite .",
    "the three known ccos pulsars have weak dipole magnetic fields , in the range @xmath20  g , and negligible spin - down power in comparison with their bolometric x - ray luminosities of @xmath127 erg  s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "an orphaned cco will remain in the region of @xmath128 space where it was born , and will continue to cool .",
    "an orphaned cco could be distinguished from an older pulsar by its residual thermal x - ray luminosity , which lasts @xmath129  yr , and calvera is of the right age to fill this role .",
    "however , with its larger magnetic field strength and shorter period than the known cco pulsars ( figure  1 ) , calvera may no longer seem a compelling prototype of a cco descendant .",
    "nevertheless , independent of the discovery of calvera , a theory for ccos has been developed that involves burial of a typical ns magnetic field ( @xmath130  g ) by prompt fall - back of a small amount of supernova ejecta , followed by diffusive regrowth of the same field on a time scale of @xmath131  yr @xcite .",
    "magnetic field growth has long been suggested as a reason why pulsar braking indices are all less than the dipole value of 3 . in this picture , ccos would be in a phase of rapid field growth , with large negative braking index , and their immediate descendants would lie directly above them on the @xmath128 diagram .",
    "the possibility that calvera , or almost any radio pulsar for that matter , was once a cco , can not therefore be ruled out .",
    "such a scenario , in which ccos quickly join the ordinary radio pulsar population , carries the added benefit of not requiring yet another family of nss to exist that could strain the already evident excess of pulsars with respect to the galactic core - collapse supernova rate , as enumerated by @xcite .      the upper limit that we have derived on calvera s ( assumed isotropic ) @xmath6  mev luminosity , @xmath132 erg  s@xmath2 , is a factor of @xmath133 below typical pulsars of similar @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "@xcite determined several other @xmath5-ray  upper limits for pulsars from _ fermi _  data .",
    "interestingly , psr j1740 + 1000  mentioned above is among those not detected , with @xmath134 erg  s@xmath2 as shown in figure  [ fig : fermi ] .",
    "this is similar to the limit on calvera only if the latter is at its maximum distance of 2  kpc .",
    "another energetic pulsar of low @xmath5-ray  luminosity is psr j1531@xmath855610 , which is weak enough so that only its pulsed luminosity has been measured .",
    "nevertheless , it is more luminous than calvera .",
    "if calvera is one of the nearest pulsars , at @xmath135  pc , then its @xmath5-ray  luminosity is @xmath136 erg  s@xmath2 .",
    "this is so far below any other pulsar of comparable @xmath9 that it could logically be taken as an argument against such a small distance .",
    "however , we are not certain what the limits are on possible beaming corrections for @xmath5-ray  pulsars . in order to explain @xmath5-ray - weak pulsars such as psr j1740 + 1000",
    ", @xcite favored an interpretation in which an aligned rotator , with the observer close to the rotation axis , would direct its outer - gap @xmath5-ray  emission away from the observer .",
    "but calvera is not likely to be an aligned rotator given its large x - ray pulsed fraction , @xmath137 above 1  kev ( figure  [ fig : pulse ] ) .",
    "neither is psr j1740 + 1000  likely to be an aligned rotator , as its thermal x - ray emission also has a pulsed fraction of @xmath137 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is difficult to understand the lack of radio pulsations from calvera if it is an aligned rotator unless is it intrinsically radio silent .",
    "the absence of both radio and @xmath5-ray  emission from calvera must imply a strong constraint on the beaming patterns and creation of high - energy particles in pulsars . now having two energetic pulsars at high galactic latitude with no @xmath5-ray  emission to faint limits ,",
    "we wonder if other undetected pulsars in the galactic plane could be similarly weak , while source confusion and diffuse emission prevents such low upper limits from being established for them .",
    "more than three years after 59  ms x - ray pulsations were discovered from calvera , we obtained new timing observations with _ chandra_that show its frequency to have changed , corresponding to @xmath33  s@xmath25 . interpreting this as the dipole spin - down of an isolated ns , its derived properties are @xmath1 erg  s@xmath2 , @xmath99  kyr , and @xmath4  g. these make calvera an energetic , young pulsar with a magnetic field toward the low end of the distribution , and unusual for its absence of @xmath5-ray  emission .",
    "we performed image likelihood and timing searches on almost five years of _ fermi _  data , with a resulting upper limit of @xmath81 photons  @xmath13 s@xmath2 , or energy flux @xmath82 erg  @xmath13  s@xmath2 above 100  mev , a faint limit that is made possible by calvera s location at high galactic latitude , @xmath14 .",
    "how extreme this non - detection is depends on the poorly known distance .",
    "since x - ray spectral fits have an absorbing column density greater than or equal to the galactic value , we estimate a lower limit on @xmath95 of @xmath138  pc .",
    "a upper limit of @xmath126  kpc can be set by requiring the thermal x - ray emitting area , which dominates the x - ray luminosity , to be less than the surface area of a 12  km radius ns .",
    "the equivalent upper limit on @xmath5-rayluminosity is @xmath84 erg  s@xmath2 , smaller than all @xmath5-ray  pulsars of similar @xmath9 .",
    "if calvera were as close as 200  pc , the absence of both radio and @xmath5-rayluminosity would be extraordinary , and challenging for existing models of pulsar acceleration zones and beaming , especially since calvera has substantial x - ray pulse modulation .",
    "the combination of these properties is difficult to accommodate in an aligned rotator , or any other geometry .",
    "the radio pulsar psr j1740 + 1000  bears some resemblance to calvera in that it is a young , energetic pulsar at high galactic latitude that is not a @xmath5-ray  source .",
    "we obtained an upper limit on the proper motion of psr j1740 + 1000 , @xmath122  mas  yr@xmath2 , by comparing radio - timing and x - ray positions over a 10 year baseline .",
    "this tends to rule out that psr j1740 + 1000  was born in the galactic disk . instead",
    ", its progenitor could have been a runaway o or b star .",
    "we will soon assess calvera s proper motion with an upcoming _ chandra _   hrc observation .",
    "it had been speculated that calvera could be an orphaned cco , a descendant of the weakly magnetized x - ray pulsars that fall unexpectedly in a sparsely occupied region of @xmath128 space . even though its dipole magnetic field is larger than that of the cco pulsars",
    ", calvera could be following the track predicted by the theory of field burial , with a magnetic field that was initially submerged by supernova debris , but is rapidly reemerging and approaching normal strength . in this theory , many ordinary radio pulsars may be the orphaned ccos , which could be revealed by an excess of thermal x - ray luminosity with respect to their spin - down ages .",
    "this investigation is based on observations obtained with the _ chandra _  x - ray observatory and _ xmm - newton_. _ xmm - newton _  is an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and nasa .",
    "we have made use of the nasa astrophysics data system ( ads ) and software provided by the chandra x - ray center ( cxc ) in the application package ciao .",
    "this publication also makes use of data products from the wide - field infrared survey explorer , which is a joint project of the university of california , los angeles , and the jet propulsion laboratory / california institute of technology , funded by the national aeronautics and space administration .",
