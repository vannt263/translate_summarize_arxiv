    "we review a scenario @xcite where a set of massless large-@xmath1 nambu - goldstone bosons @xcite interact with themselves and dynamically generate a scalar resonance ( the @xmath0 ) , thus breaking the chiral symmetry , which should be restored when considering a thermal bath below the critical value ; after attaining this , and since the pions do not gain thermal masses , we obtain that the chiral restoration is a second - order phase transition .",
    "we begin by considering the following @xmath2 nonlinear sigma model @xcite with a metric and its associated vacuum constraint given by    @xmath3    after expanding the non - diagonal term in ( [ metric ] ) and reminding that we only want to study elastic scattering processes , we obtain the feynman diagram and rule given in the left side of fig [ ampzerot ] , whose loop integral in the dimensional regularization scheme reads @xcite :    @xmath4+\\mathcal{o}(\\epsilon ) .",
