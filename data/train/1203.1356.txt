    "some active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are surrounded by massive ionized nebulae extending to several tens of kiloparsec from the central engines .",
    "the first systematic study of such extended emission - line region ( eelr ) around quasars in combination with nuclear spectral properties was presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they found that nearly half of their 24 objects are eelr quasars ( quasars with detectable eelr , following * ? ? ? * ) and that the eelr quasars have larger [ ] @xmath05007 equivalent width ( ew ) , broader and bumpier balmer lines , and weaker emission compared to non - eelr quasars .",
    "in addition , the eelr quasars are predominantly associated with steep - spectrum radio emission with extended , lobe - dominant morphology , in contrast to the non - eelr quasars associated with flat - spectrum radio emission with compact , core - dominant morphology or without strong radio emission .",
    "the correlation between eelr phenomenon and radio emission was further confirmed by @xcite , who obtained narrow - band [ ] line images of 47 quasars . above the limiting luminosity of extended [ ] emission @xmath1 } = 5 \\times 10^{41}$ ] erg s@xmath2 , 10 out of 26 ( 10/26 ) of their steep - spectrum radio quasars ( ssrqs ) have eelr , while majority of the flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) and the radio - quiet quasars ( rqqs ; 7/7 of the fsrqs and 13/14 of the rqqs ) are non - eelr sources @xcite .",
    "they also found a correlation between nuclear [ ] luminosity and the presence of eelr .",
    "@xcite analyzed the rest - frame ultraviolet spectra of 12 ssrqs in the @xcite sample and found that @xmath01240 emission is suppressed in eelr quasars , which they claimed points to lower metallicity of the broad - line region ( blr ) compared to non - eelr quasars .",
    "they did not find any systematic difference in other agn properties such as continuum luminosity and mass of super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) between the eelr and non - eelr ssrqs .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite observed 20 quasars dominated by rqqs and found eelr around 8 of them .",
    "the correlation between nuclear ew , h@xmath3 line width , and eelr was confirmed in their sample too .",
    "in addition , they found a dependence of eelr on smbh mass ( @xmath4 ) and reported that @xmath5 separates eelr quasars with larger @xmath4 from non - eelr quasars with smaller @xmath4 .",
    "searches for eelr around rqqs were also presented by @xcite and @xcite focusing on obscured , type-2 quasars .",
    "they found eelr around 10 out of 20 objects and claimed that luminous eelr is not necessarily associated with powerful radio sources .",
    "observational constraints on the emergence of eelr can possibly be a key to understand the co - evolution of galaxies and smbhs .",
    "it is now widely accepted that the tight correlation between smbh mass and bulge mass of their host galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicates the intimately - connected evolution of the two systems .",
    "the most compelling process of interaction between galaxies and smbhs is the agn feedback , in which the energy emitted by agn regulates the mass accretion to smbhs and drives galactic wind that can expel cold gas from and quench star formation in host galaxies",
    ". the agn feedback could also give a solution to the two major problems in the current galaxy formation models based on the @xmath6 cold dark matter ( cdm ) theory : first is the `` overcooling '' problem in which much more massive galaxies are formed in the numerical simulations than observed due to too efficient gas cooling , and second is the `` inverted color - mass - morphology relation '' problem in which massive galaxies are predicted to be blue and disk - dominant rather than red and spheroid - dominant as observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , observational evidence is still lacking on whether the agn feedback is actually present or not and how it works if present . while measurements of galaxy evolution imprinted on the stellar - mass ( luminosity ) function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) especially at its massive end @xcite and its integration ( the extragalactic background light ; e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or analyses of the nature of the agn phenomenon ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can put indirect constraints on the co - evolution , eelr possibly provides more direct clues as to the interrelation between galaxies and smbhs .",
    "the previous measurements indicate that eelr gas is largely ionized by agn rather than stellar population @xcite , hence we may be witnessing the agn feedback in action in this galaxy - wide ionization process .",
    "indeed , @xcite recently showed that agn photoionizes and kinematically disturbs the interstellar medium throughout the entire host galaxies of luminous type-2 quasars .    in this paper ,",
    "new observation of eelr around five quasars at @xmath7 is first presented .",
    "then it is combined with the previous observations of eelr and associated agn and host galaxy properties obtained mainly from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) archive . by using this compiled sample as well as the control samples of sdss quasars and galaxies",
    ", we aim to perform a comprehensive analysis of eelr in the context of galaxy evolution . a cosmology with @xmath8",

    "all the presented magnitudes are on the ab system .",
    "the observed quasars were selected from the sdss data release 7 ( dr7 ) quasar catalog @xcite .",
    "the simple selection criteria were set based on redshift ( @xmath12 in order that [ ] @xmath05007 falls in the narrow - band filter transmission described below ) and nuclear [ ] luminosity ( @xmath13 } > 10^{42}$ ] erg s@xmath2 ) . among the objects meeting the criteria , those with various smbh mass and radio loudness and with the highest [ ] luminosity were picked up .",

    "the observation was carried out on 2011 may 34 under the open - use program s11a-028 .",
    "the sky condition was sometimes non - photometric , but the measured flux of celestial objects was mostly stable within 10 % variation .",
    "the seeing was 0.81.1 arcsec . for each target , nine 300-sec or three 900-sec exposures in na@xmath16 and nine 100-sec or three 300-sec exposures in @xmath19 were obtained , depending on the source brightness . in addition , a spectrophotometric standard star sa 104 - 335 was observed with the same instrument configuration as the target observation .",

    "the continuum levels beneath [ ] @xmath04959 and @xmath05007 were estimated by interpolation between continuum windows at both ( shorter- and longer - wavelength ) sides of the lines , and then the spectrum was decomposed into [ ] and continuum .",

    "using these measures , accurate continuum subtraction was achieved as follows .",
    "the radial profiles of all the quasar nuclei on the obtained images are consistent with the point spread functions ( psfs ) derived from nearby stars , hence they are dominated by the radiation from central unresolved sources . the na@xmath16 and @xmath19 images were decomposed into nuclear ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) and extended ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) components by the best - fit moffat profiles , fitted within a 10-pixel ( 2-arcsec ) aperture on top of the quasar peak positions .",

    "note that the expression ( [ eq : contsub_nuc ] ) , although it is most accurate , is not applicable to the extended components since the relative fluxes of [ ] and continuum are different from @xmath33}$ ] and @xmath34 measured in the sdss spectroscopic fibers .",
    "it is worth re - emphasizing that the spectral information is quite useful in the above process as an accurate cross - calibrator of the images taken in the different filters .",
    "thanks to the massive spectroscopic observations conducted by the sdss , nuclear properties are now known for many quasars with eelr measurements in the literature .",

    "for some objects without counterparts in the sdss catalog , the nuclear properties are taken from the above papers as well as @xcite .",
    "combined with the new observation presented in this paper , we end up with 61 type-1 quasars with eelr measurements ( 27 detections and 34 non - detections ) and with a variety of nuclear properties .",

    "as described in section 1 , the presence of eelr correlates with some agn properties .",
    "quasars with larger [ ] ew , broader and bumpier balmer lines , fainter , and ssrq - like radio emission have higher possibility of accompanying eelr around them .",
    "the correlation is fairly strong , as @xcite showed that if certain quasars are pre - selected based on their radio and nuclear [ ] emissions , @xmath3150 % of them would turn out to have eelr as opposed to @xmath3120 % with no a priori assumption .",
    "note that the above emissions arise from the different parts of agn ; broad balmer lines and the lines from parsec - scale blr , the [ ] lines from kiloparsec - scale nlr , and radio and eelr emissions from more extended , galaxy - wide scales .",
    "the correlation among them except for eelr has been well known since the seminal work by @xcite . with the principal component analysis technique",
    ", they showed that most of the variance in agn spectral properties are contained in two sets of correlations . a strong anti - correlation between the measures of [ ] and is the principal component 1 ( pc 1 ) , or eigenvector 1 , with which balmer line profile is also associated .",
    "the general consensus is that pc 1 is driven mainly by eddington ratio ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in figure [ nuc_prop_p1 ] we plot h@xmath3 line width versus the relative strength @xmath66",
    "@xmath67 ew()/ew(h@xmath3 ) of the sdss quasars in @xcite .",
    "the both measures constitute the four - dimensional eigenvector 1 ( 4de1 ; other measures are the soft x - ray photon index and @xmath01549 line profile ) space proposed by @xcite .",
    "the anti - correlation between them is evident in figure [ nuc_prop_p1 ] , which forms a sequence of eddington ratio .",
    "the data scatter reflects the orientation effects as well as the intrinsic variety of quasars , since one would observe larger line fwhm and @xmath66 ( is emitted from the outermost part of blr ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as the viewing angle relative to the dust - torus plane decreases . on the other hand , pc 2 links optical luminosity and @xmath04686 line emission .",
    "its physical origin is thought to be mass - accretion rate to smbhs because of its strong correlation with optical luminosity .",
    "therefore one would expect that the ratio of pc 1 and pc 2 is proportional to smbh mass , which was actually proved by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite found that the radio loudness is strongly related to smbh mass as radio - loud / radio - quiet quasars are associated with most / least massive smbhs .",
    "the above arguments suggest that most of the agn properties can be understood on the pc 1 - pc 2 plane .",
    "we plot eddington ratio and continuum luminosity of the compiled type-1 sample , as well as the whole sdss quasars in the @xcite catalog , in figure [ nuc_prop_p4 ] .",
    "first of all , we remark that the objects with eelr measurements cover the distribution of the whole sdss quasars fairly uniformly on this plane .",
    "it was not anticipated since the existing eelr observations are subject to strong selection biases individually .",
    "we see the clear separation of radio - quiet and radio - loud sources as pointed out by @xcite , the latter being associated with most massive smbhs .",
    "in addition , ssrqs are observed to have higher values of eddington ratio or smbh mass than fsrqs .",
    "we also find some correlations containing eelr .",
    "they are shown more clearly in figure [ nuc_prop_p9 ] where the fraction of eelr detection is plotted as a function of the nuclear properties .",
    "the eelr fraction is strongly anti - correlated with eddington ratio , and its weak correlation with smbh mass may also be present .",
    "the former relation is most likely the underlying basis of the correlation between eelr and pc 1 .",
    "while no clear trend is found with respect to radio emission , we do find that eelr luminosity is systematically higher in ssrqs than in the rest of the sample ; the mean luminosity is @xmath1}$ ] = @xmath68 and @xmath69 erg s@xmath2 for the ssrqs and rqqs , respectively",
    ". the difference would be even larger when we consider the fact that the eelr luminosity of most ssrqs measured by @xcite is underestimated since the emission in a central 10-kpc aperture is excluded .",
    "it explains why the eelr fraction around ssrqs is much higher than those around the other populations in the pioneering work of @xcite .",
    "one of the highest dependency of eelr is found on nuclear [ ] luminosity , @xmath13}$ ] . in figure [ nuc_prop_p6 ]",
    "we show eddington ratio versus @xmath13}$ ] of the same samples .",
    "it is clearly seen that the quasars with eelr measurements are biased to high @xmath13}$ ] compared to the whole sdss quasars .",
    "here we find that low-@xmath13}$ ] quasars tend to lack eelr : only 3 out of 20 objects with @xmath13 } < 10^{42.5}$ ] erg s@xmath2 have detectable , faint eelr , while the eelr fraction is @xmath70 50 % at the higher @xmath13}$ ] .",
    "this trend was reported previously for smaller samples ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "figure [ nuc_prop_p6 ] also tells us that @xmath13}$ ] does _ not _ strongly correlate with eddington ratio , although it correlates with pc 1 @xcite .",
    "no clear correlation between the two measures indicates that pc 1 is not solely driven by eddington ratio  there should be another physical mechanism(s ) that links nuclear [ ] luminosity with other pc 1 constituents .",
    "what can we learn from these correlations ?",
    "while the clear anti - correlation between eelr and eddington ratio is observed , it does not seem to reflect their direct relationship through the agn radiation since ( i ) the eelr fraction is highest for the agns with most _ inefficient _ gas accretion to smbhs ; ( ii ) nuclear [ ] luminosity produced similarly by the agn radiation shows no clear correlation with eddington ratio ; ( iii ) a positive correlation between the eelr fraction and continuum luminosity is not observed .",
    "therefore it is more reasonable to consider the presence of an independent mechanism that leads to the high / low eelr fraction and low / high eddington ratio at the same time .",
    "the dependence of eelr on radio emission and ( possibly ) smbh mass may also be related to this hidden mechanism .",
    "we will come back to this issue further below .",
    "the lack of simple relation between eelr and continuum luminosity ( accretion rate ) was also reported by @xcite , who suggested that the correlation between nuclear and extended [ ] emissions , which is also evident in our larger sample , may be the sequence of the available gas amount rather than agn emission characteristics .",
    "the hypothesis that the gas availability is the primary determinant of eelr creation is supported by the probe of host galaxies in the following section .",
    "if eelr represents a certain stage of galaxy evolution , as the agn feedback scenario implies , their presence may be related to stellar - population properties of host galaxies . here",
    "an investigation of such a relation is presented for the first time , thanks to the recent measurements of eelr around sdss type-2 quasars at @xmath60 = 0.3  0.6 @xcite . in figure",
    "[ gal_prop_p1 ] , we plot stellar mass versus rest - frame @xmath49 color of the type-2 quasars as well as the control samples defined in section [ sec : datacomp ] .",
    "most sdss galaxies at these relatively high redshifts are luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) , forming a clump at the massive red end on this color - stellar mass diagram ( we could see the red sequence rather than a clump if the sdss observations were deep enough to detect fainter galaxies ) .",
    "the type-2 quasars are bluer than the lrgs ( see also , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but are redder than star - forming galaxies which form the `` blue cloud '' around @xmath71 in the local universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is consistent with the result of @xcite who found that local agns reside in the `` green valley '' between the blue cloud and the red sequence on the color - stellar mass diagram .",
    "interestingly , we find that the eelr quasars are associated with bluer and more massive galaxies compared to the non - eelr counterparts . in order to show this trend more clearly",
    ", we define a massive - blue-ness indicator , @xmath72 @xmath67 log m@xmath73 @xmath28 ( @xmath49 ) , which increases diagonally toward the bottom - right corner of figure [ gal_prop_p1 ] as shown by the arrow . the number distribution of the type-2 quasars with eelr measurements as a function of @xmath72 is plotted in figure [ gal_prop_p2 ] .",
    "it shows a clear , monotonic increase in the fraction of eelr quasars as @xmath72 increases : only 1/8 of the lowest-@xmath72 quasars has eelr , while the fraction rises to 7/8 in the highest-@xmath72 counterparts .    what is the origin of this dichotomy ?",
    "blue colors point to current or recent star - formation activity , which in turn indicates the presence of a certain amount of gas in the galaxies . based on the velocity structure and mass of eelr gas around mostly ssrqs , as well as the correlation between eelr and radio emission",
    ", @xcite suggested that eelr is formed in galaxy minor merger which is accompanied by production of a radio jet associated to agn .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by @xcite for a rqq .",
    "@xcite found that the majority of the type-2 , radio - quiet eelr quasars show the signs of galaxy merger or interaction while none of the non - eelr counterparts show such signs .",
    "these observations suggest that the gas may be brought in by the merging companions .",
    "the merger / interaction possibly activates the observed star formation as well as agn that ionizes the gas and creates eelr , since the interstellar gas of merging galaxies can be effectively brought into the nuclear regions with rapid loss of the angular momentum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the fact that eelr is preferentially found in gas - rich , massive blue galaxies is consistent with both the above scenario and the previous arguments that the presence of eelr is regulated by the amount of available gas .",
    "furthermore , massive galaxies are known to be the dominant hosts of radio - loud agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it naturally explains the eelr - radio emission connection described above , and can also provide the `` hidden '' mechanism behind the anti - correlation between eelr and eddington ratio since the majority of radio - loud agns are powered by inefficiently - accreting , most massive smbhs ( see figure [ nuc_prop_p4 ] ) .",
    "the recent kinematic observations have revealed the presence of galaxy - wide , disturbed gas in quasar host galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while only a small fraction of the gas is generally found to have high enough velocity to escape the galaxies , @xcite showed that these estimates are in fact lower limits and may be consistent with expectations of recent agn feedback models .",
    "if the feedback scenario is correct , the gas responsible for eelr and star formation ( hence blue colors of galaxies ) would soon be swept away by the agn - driven , galactic winds . in this regard",
    ", it may be noteworthy that none of the most luminous ( log @xmath74 @xmath75 45.5 ) type-1 quasars in our sample has eelr as shown in figure [ nuc_prop_p4 ] .",
    "it is tempting to raise the possibility of the gas stripping , but we have to be aware that ( i ) the relatively - high eddington ratio for these objects may be responsible for the deficit of eelr ; ( ii ) the bright central radiation can prevent us from detecting eelr in the most luminous sources . more data is needed for further inspection on this issue . while the process discussed above corresponds to the so - called `` quasar - mode '' feedback , it is interesting to point out that a clear interaction between radio jets and eelr clouds with high velocity dispersion is observed in ssrqs @xcite , which invokes the another , `` radio mode '' of the feedback .    in the nearby universe , @xcite investigated the properties of seyfert galaxies with eelr , dominated by type-2 objects . while their morphology supports the merger origin of eelr , they have relatively quiescent kinematics without a sign of high - velocity gas leaving the galaxies seen in higher - luminosity agns .",
    "it may simply indicate that creation of the powerful galactic winds requires quasar - class energy input into the interstellar medium , hence the relation of eelr to agns may be different at high and low luminosity .",
    "a comprehensive analysis of eelr phenomenon around quasars is presented in this paper .",
    "we compile the past eelr measurements for type-1 @xcite and type-2 @xcite quasars , and combine them with the new observation of five quasars at @xmath7 .",
    "the new observation was carried out using the subaru / suprime - cam with the narrow - band na@xmath16 filter ( corresponding to the redshifted [ ] @xmath05007 ) , and led to the discovery of eelr around two sources , sdss 091401.75@xmath23050750.6 and sdss 150752.66@xmath23133844.5 .",
    "the observation effectively complements the existing measurements on the agn principal - component ( pc ) plane .",
    "the properties of associated agn ( smbh mass , continuum and line luminosity , and radio characteristics ) and host galaxies ( stellar mass and rest - frame color ) are collected and calculated from the sdss and other observations .",
    "we find that eelr anti - correlates with eddington ratio , which is most likely the underlying basis of the known correlations between eelr and the pc 1 ( eigenvector 1 ) constituents .",
    "eelr and nuclear [ ] emissions are also highly correlated .",
    "we argue that the primary determinant of eelr creation is the gas availability , rather than agn emission characteristics .",
    "the recent observations @xcite revealed that a significant fraction of eelr galaxies show the signs of recent minor merger , which may have brought in the gas and activated star formation as well as agn that creates eelr . in line with the above arguments",
    ", we find that eelr is preferentially associated with gas - rich , massive blue galaxies .",
    "it may explain the whole set of observed correlations containing eelr , since massive galaxies are the dominant hosts of radio - loud agns characterized with low eddington ratio and high smbh mass .",
    "the hierarchical structure formation models based on the @xmath6cdm theory predict that galaxies are assembled through a sequence of mergers of smaller building blocks . in figure",
    "[ picture ] we show a schematic view of the color - stellar mass diagram , or equivalently the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , of observed galaxies .",
    "once a galaxy is grown up to the massive tip of the blue cloud ( represented by the seven - rayed star in the figure ) , it has two ways to evolve further .",
    "if no merger happens subsequently for sufficient time , the galaxy would migrate into the low - mass end of the red sequence as the star formation fades out .",
    "it can then move up the red sequence toward the massive end through dry merger with gas - poor galaxies ( see also , * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , wet merger of the galaxy with gas - rich galaxies at any stage of the above evolution could push the galaxy into the green valley where agn fraction is the highest .",
    "if the galaxy ( and hence the central smbh , assuming the positive bulge mass - smbh mass correlation ) is massive enough and the merging events involve ample supply of gas for triggering vigorous star formation , the galaxy would be driven to the massive blue realm at the extreme corner of the valley .",
    "this event would also activate agn , which ionizes the gas and creates luminous eelr .",
    "the galaxy - wide energy injection by the agn radiation might then blow away the gas and quench the star formation , pushing the galaxy back to the red sequence . while this last argument is less certain due to the lack of evidence about the energy injection process ,",
    "recent observations have started to reveal the presence of agn - driven , galaxy - scale outflows which may be quenching the star formation there .",
    "( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the above agn feedback scenario gives a solution to the major problems of the classical hierarchical galaxy formation models , i.e. , the overproduction of massive galaxies and the inverted color - magnitude - morphology relation ( see section 1 ) by suppressing star formation in massive galaxies .",
    "however , many details of the process are still unknown and to be debated .",
    "what is observationally clear is that eelr is found at the exact region on the cmd where the agn feedback is expected to work  the massive blue corner that seems to be the forbidden area for observed galaxies .",
    "it provides a piece of evidence for the presence of the agn feedback , which may be playing a leading role in the co - evolution of galaxies and central smbhs .",
    "the author is grateful to b. husemann for kindly providing the unpublished data on their re - analysis of the eelr measurements .",
    "the anonymous referee has provided many suggestive comments to improve the manuscript .",
