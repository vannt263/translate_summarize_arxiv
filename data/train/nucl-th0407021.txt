    "the study of baryon structure is currently in a new stage of development as new data with unprecedented precision have become available due to the high intensity , high duty factor electron accelerators , complemented with large acceptance multi - particle detectors .",
    "very precise measurements of electromagnetically induced hadron production and its @xmath11 evolution are available now , providing a new level in testing of phenomenological models and qcd in the nonperturbative and subasymptotic domains .",
    "much of our understanding of hadron structure is connected with the constituent quark model .",
    "simple nonrelativistic quark models were originally proposed and in many cases successfully used to explain the relations between the masses and photocouplings of hadrons .",
    "however , the picture is changing when @xmath11 grows , and successes of the simplified quark models do not extend to the electroexcitation amplitudes .",
    "once the momentum transfer becomes greater than the masses of the constituent quarks , a relativistic treatment of the electromagnetic excitations becomes essential .",
    "the dependence on the small - distance interquark forces also becomes more significant with increasing @xmath11 .",
    "it is known also that a series of difficulties in the quark model description of the resonance properties , such as the unusually slow falloff with @xmath11 of the @xmath8 transverse photocoupling amplitude and small mass of the @xmath6 , gave rise to different explanations of the nature of the nucleon resonances . among others ,",
    "the presence of gluonic degrees of freedom in the @xmath6 @xcite and @xmath12 components in the @xmath8 @xcite have been suggested .",
    "accurate measurements of the resonance transition form factors will put all these models to stringent tests as the internal dynamics of excited states strongly affects their @xmath11 evolution .",
    "it is remarkable that this new stage in the experimental study of the @xmath11 evolution of the hadron electromagnetic characteristics is paralleled by the significant progress in lattice calculations and their successes in the description of the nucleon and transition form factors @xcite and nucleon resonances masses @xcite .",
    "accurate results for the electroexcitation of the nucleon resonances will provide important information for understanding of the @xmath13 structure from the first principles of qcd by exploring lattice calculations .    recently , precise data on exclusive electroproduction of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 on protons in the first and second resonance regions were obtained at jefferson lab using the cebaf large acceptance spectrometer ( clas ) .",
    "the data include measurements of the cross sections @xcite , including complete angular distributions for the @xmath14 @xcite and @xmath15 @xcite final states . the data also include first measurements of the longitudinal beam asymmetry ( @xmath16 ) for @xmath3 @xcite and @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "@xmath16 is very sensitive to the interference of transverse and longitudinal amplitudes .",
    "these data allow one to investigate the contributions of resonances to @xmath9 and @xmath2 electroproduction in greater detail .",
    "the goal of the present investigation is to extract from the data @xcite the magnitudes of the @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 resonance contributions to these processes .",
    "the analysis is made using two approaches : ( 1 ) fixed - t dispersion relations ( dr ) and ( 2 ) isobar model ( i m ) , which were both successfully used in refs .",
    "@xcite to analyze @xmath9 and @xmath2 photoproduction .",
    "comparison of the results obtained in the two conceptually very different approaches allows us to draw conclusions on the model dependence of the extracted resonance characteristics .",
    "the analysis was carried out at @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where measurements of @xmath16 were also made .",
    "for these values of @xmath11 we have available the most complete set of clas data on @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 cross sections .",
    "the formalism is presented in section ii . in section",
    "iii we present the data and the method of analysis . in these sections",
    "we also discuss the assumptions and approximations made in the analysis . in section",
    "iv we present and discuss the results , and a comparison with previous data and quark model predictions is made .",
    "finally , we summarize the results in section v.",
    "the approaches we use to analyze both @xmath9 and @xmath2 electroproduction on protons are dispersion relations and the isobar model approximation which are discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite in detail .",
    "here we only briefly present the main points of these approaches .",
    "the imaginary parts of the amplitudes in this approach are built from the @xmath20 channel resonance contributions parametrized in the breit - wigner form .",
    "all four- , three- , and two - star resonances from the rpp @xcite with masses up to @xmath21 are taken into account . using fixed - t dispersion relations we find the real parts of the amplitudes .",
    "real parts of the amplitudes include the born term , i.e. the contributions of the nucleon poles in the @xmath20 and @xmath22 channels , and the contribution of the @xmath23 channel @xmath9 exchange in the case of pion electroproduction .",
    "they also include integrals over imaginary parts of the amplitudes , where we take into account only the contribution of the resonance energy region . according to estimations made in refs .",
    "@xcite , the role of the high energy contributions to dispersion integrals in the analysis of data in the first and second resonance regions is negligibly small .    in the case of pion electroproduction in the elasticity regions of multipole amplitudes",
    ", there is an additional constraint connected with the watson theorem . according to the phase - shift analyses of the @xmath24 scattering ,",
    "the @xmath24 amplitude @xmath25 is elastic up to @xmath26 ( see , for example , the gwu(vpi ) analysis @xcite ) . by this reason , utilization of the watson theorem",
    "allows us to write dispersion relations for the amplitudes @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , which correspond to the @xmath5 resonance , in the form of integral equations . in our analysis",
    "these amplitudes are presented as the solutions of these equations .",
    "they contain two parts : particular and homogeneous solutions .",
    "particular solutions have definite magnitudes fixed by the born term .",
    "homogeneous solutions have definite shapes fixed by the integral equations and arbitrary weights which are fitted parameters in our analysis .    due to the watson theorem and large @xmath24 phases @xmath30 and @xmath31 , a significant contribution to the imaginary parts of the amplitudes in the @xmath5 resonance region can also give nonresonant amplitudes @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "in order to find these amplitudes we have calculated their real parts by dispersion relations , taking into account the born term and the @xmath5 resonance contribution .",
    "then the imaginary parts of the amplitudes were found using the watson theorem with the phases @xmath30 , @xmath31 taken from the analysis of the gwu(vpi ) group @xcite . above @xmath38 , these contributions were smoothly reduced to 0 .      for the isobar model approximation we used the approaches developed in refs .",
    "@xcite with modifications made in refs . @xcite .",
    "the main modification in the case of pion electroproduction is connected with the incorporation of regge poles into the unitary isobar model of ref .",
    "@xcite . due to this modification ,",
    "the amplitudes of the model transform with increasing energies into the amplitudes in the regge pole regime .",
    "isobar models contain the contributions of resonances parametrized in breit - wigner form , and nonresonant backgrounds built from the born terms and the @xmath23-channel @xmath39 and @xmath40 contributions . in the case of pion production , the background is unitarized via unitarization of the multipole amplitudes in the @xmath41-matrix approximation .",
    "below the two - pion production threshold , the background multipole amplitudes unitarized in this approximation satisfy the watson theorem . at these energies ,",
    "the breit - wigner formulas for the resonance contributions are modified in ref .",
    "@xcite in such a way that the resonance contributions to multipole amplitudes also satisfy the watson theorem .",
    "the born terms play an important role in both approaches .",
    "they are determined by the coupling constant @xmath42 which is well known , and @xmath43 which we fix according to the results of the analysis of @xmath2 photoproduction data in ref .",
    "@xcite . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , in the unitary isobar model that we use for the analysis of @xmath9 electroproduction , the @xmath44 coupling being pseudovector at the threshold is transformed with increasing energy into pseudoscalar coupling .",
    "the parameter that describes this transition was fitted in our analysis ; it turned out to be very close to the value found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the born terms are determined also by the nucleon and pion form factors .",
    "we have parametrized these form factors in the following way .",
    "according to world data and taking into account recent measurements ( see , for example , review @xcite ) , we have parametrized proton form factors using the bosted formulas @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11 evolution of the neutron magnetic form factor we have described by the dipole formula @xmath45 , taking into account the observed deviation from this behaviour @xcite .",
    "the value of the neutron electric form factor turned out to be very important for the simultaneous description of the @xmath1 and @xmath0 cross sections in the @xmath5 resonance region .",
    "this form factor was obtained from the requirement of the best description of these data .",
    "as demonstrated below in section iva , the obtained values are in good agreement with the results of recent measurements @xcite .",
    "the pion form factor was parametrized according to recent measurements @xcite by the monopole formula @xmath46 .    at @xmath47 ,",
    "the @xmath39 and @xmath40 contributions were found in the analyses of @xmath9 and @xmath2 photoproduction data in refs .",
    "we have introduced the @xmath11 evolution of these contributions via the description of the @xmath48 and @xmath49 form factors using the dipole formula @xmath50 . in order to take into account the uncertainty of these form factors , the @xmath39 and @xmath40 contributions were allowed to vary in the vicinity of their values found in",
    "the above described way .",

    "both data sets include first , second , and partly third resonance regions . the full angular coverage of the clas data , and the presence of the @xmath16 data , which are sensitive both to transverse and longitudinal amplitudes , allowed us to reliably evaluate the resonance contributions in the first and second resonance regions .",
