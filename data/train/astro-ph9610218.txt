    "this is the second paper in a series where we try photometricaly to quantify galaxy evolution at low redshifts ( @xmath6 ) , from reasonably large and homogeneous samples .",
    "we have shown in bertin & dennefeld ( @xcite , paper i ) that optical galaxy counts were consistent with little evolution down to @xmath7 , corresponding to @xmath8 for @xmath5 galaxies . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the case of the far - infrared domain .    the far - infrared ( fir )",
    "is very sensitive to ongoing star - formation activity in galaxies .",
    "warm dust , essentially heated by the blue / uv continuum of young ob stars , makes a large contribution to the total fir output of late - type objects . at the same time , a significant heating by an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) is possible in the most luminous fir - emitting objects , although the respective contributions of star - formation and agns are not yet well determined . in this context , a statistical analysis of a deep and homogeneous fir - selected galaxy sample should easily allow one to trace evolution of star - formation and/or agn activity with redshift .",
    "the iras ( infrared astronomical satellite ) survey , with its four infrared channels at 12 , 25 , 60 and 100   provides a unique tool for such studies , despite its moderate sensitivity .",
    "based on the point source catalog ( psc ) and the more recent faint source catalog ( fsc ) extracted from the iras data , several workers have investigated the evolution hypothesis on subsamples reaching various depths .",
    "the situation is still somewhat unclear , although evolution seems to be detected at 60  in most cases .",
    "using psc data , with solid identifications and radial velocities , saunders ( @xcite ) claimed a very strong evolution effect in their sample , while fisher ( @xcite ) found theirs compatible with no evolution ( the latter has however a somewhat lower median redshift ) . using the deeper fsc data , lonsdale ( @xcite ) found evidence for strong evolution from source number counts .",
    "oliver ( @xcite ) reported also evolution in their spectroscopic subsample , though at a slightly milder rate .",
    "two deeper studies ( hacking & houck @xcite and gregorich @xcite ) made on much smaller specific areas ( a few tens of square degrees ) suggest a large excess of faint detections .    in order to clarify the problem and to complete these studies by providing the `` missing link '' between extensive , shallow catalogs ( @xmath9  jy ) and small , very deep studies ( @xmath10  mjy ) , we have undertaken an identification program of iras sources at 60  on some selected areas in the sky , focusing ourselves especially on the faintest flux domain achievable with the faint source survey ( fss ) `` plates '' : @xmath11  mjy with a signal - to - noise ratio of 4 .",
    "our purpose is twofold : ( 1 ) to estimate the reliability of the iras survey at its very faint end , and ( 2 ) , to characterize the population of iras galaxies in the 100 mjy domain ( where evolution is expected to begin to show up in models of fir galaxy counts ) .    at this low s / n level",
    ", the data can not be interpreted in a straightforward way : completeness , reliability and measurement biases must be quantified accurately .",
    "we rely here on both monte - carlo simulations and optical identifications to estimate these effects .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  [ chap : data ] we describe the selection of the infrared `` real '' sample . ",
    "[ chap : simul ] is devoted to the description of our monte - carlo simulations of iras catalogs .",
    "these are then used in  [ chap : infra ] to interpret statistics on the infrared data ( confusion noise , number counts ) . in  [ chap : optid ] we rely on optical identifications to put further constraints on the nature of faint sources .",
    "we summarize our results in  [ chap : comp ] and compare them to those of other studies . in  [ chap : discu ] , we finally discuss the implications in the framework of galaxy evolution .",
    "the data in this study come from the very faint source sample ( vfss ) .",
    "the vfss was generated by one of us ( mm ) after the completion of the fss .",
    "the data in the fss were searched for regions where 1 ) the ir cirrus indicators noisrat and noiscor ( moshir et al . 1992 ) were small , 2 ) the spacecraft coverage was at least 4 hcons and 3 ) there was a minimum number of nearby galaxies .",
    "these conditions led to a list of fss plates which were then processed through the normal processing pipe - line .",
    "their average `` instrumental '' noise is 25  mjy instead of about 40  mjy for more typical fss plates . since with these conditions , the reliability of the sample had been verified to be high through spot checks , the extraction thresholds for the normal fss pipeline ( which were set conservatively ) were reduced ( from s / n of 3 to 2.5 ) in order to increase the completeness of the vfss down to  110 mjy at 60  ( and similar increases in completeness in the other 3 bands ) .",
    "the resulting vfss database covers  400 square degrees in 4 separate contiguous regions ( table [ tab : vfsspos ] ) and contains approximately 2,500 sources detected at 60 .",
    "the vfss is about 2 times deeper than the fsc and contains many unique sources since they can not be found in any other iras catalogue or database .",
    ".iras fields[tab : vfsspos ] [ cols= \" < , > , < , > , < , > \" , ]      + @xmath12 standard deviation ( see text ) .",
    "some very faint cirrus can unambiguously be seen in the unfiltered 60  maps , which means they may somehow contribute to the background confusion noise .",
    "gaultier ( @xcite ) have estimated the confusion noise at 60  due to cirrus to be about 7  mjy , at high galactic latitude in the fsc .",
    "this might be taken as a typical value for our catalog , as our fields are located at only @xmath13 , but are amongst the `` cleanest '' of the infrared sky concerning cirrus emission , and are comparable to higher galactic latitude zones . because the infrared surface brightness distribution of cirrus has generally much larger wings than a gaussian , one should expect their contribution to the total 68%-quantile to be less than 7  mjy in quadrature .",
    "however , given the large uncertainties in the real importance of cirrus emission in our fields , we do not discard the possibility of significant cirrus contamination of both background and individual source measurements .",
    "in any case , this fluctuation analysis is consistent with previous estimates that used the integrated infrared background ( oliver @xcite ) , although it is slightly more stringent for the @xmath14 , @xmath15 model which is only marginally compatible with our data .      deriving ( raw ) infrared number counts is straightforward here , as we are dealing with a homogeneous set of data . comparison with our monte - carlo samples is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rawcounts ] .",
    "the eddington bias is clearly visible below @xmath16  mjy . the best fit value for @xmath17 proves to depend on the flux range considered . for @xmath3  mjy ,",
    "i.e. , for sources above with s / n higher than 5 , we find @xmath18 , which however raises to @xmath19 if we consider only the 0.15 - 0.2  jy range . in the more uncertain 0.11 - 0.15  jy domain , we find @xmath20 .",
    "accounting for a @xmath21% possible error in the model normalisation yields a @xmath22 additional uncertainty to the values of @xmath17 quoted above .",
    "these numbers may indicate that the @xmath23 dependence in luminosity is inappropriate for describing the effect seen here .",
    "however , we shall remember that , as stressed earlier , assumptions about the noise distribution become very critical in the 0.11 - 0.15  jy bin and will affect conclusions made with low s / n data .",
    "this brings the question of whether our fields represent a `` fair sample '' of the universe , i.e. is there a relative excess of faint or bright sources due to large scale - structures which could distort the statistics ( see e.g. lonsdale & hacking @xcite ) ?",
    "fortunately this point can be addressed using our bright optical galaxy counts in the same areas ( paper i ) .",
    "expressed with the same magnitude scale , they are similar to those done on much larger catalogs ( apm , cosmos ) in the @xmath24 range , where most of the optical counterparts to faint iras sources lie . a strong distortion of galaxy counts induced by the presence of large scale structures is thus excluded .",
    "an interesting question is : what happens to number counts if we add some gaussian noise to the no - evolution model , in order to reach the observed intensity of fluctuations ?",
    "the answer is : almost nothing , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rawcounts ] .",
    "as expected , this test indicates that the no - evolution model could be saved only if the distribution of `` hidden '' noise components is extremely non - gaussian , creating noise peaks without increasing too much the 68% quantile .",
    "in order to find out whether the faint source excess measured in the previous sections is real or contaminated by noise peaks , some identification work is necessary .",
    "systematic studies conducted at higher iras flux limits ( e.g. wolstencroft @xcite , @xcite , sutherland & saunders @xcite ) have shown that the optical domain is well adapted to this task .",
    "thirty percent ( 6 schmidt plates ) of the vfss were analysed using photographic data in the blue @xmath25 and red @xmath26 passbands .",
    "the sensitivity of deep survey plates is well matched to our iras study , as the vfss error box at the faintest flux levels occupies roughly 1 square - arcminute on the sky , and contains already an average of @xmath27 galaxies brighter than @xmath28 .",
    "full details about the optical catalog can be found in paper i ; we summarize here its main features .",
    "this catalogue is quite small compared to large galaxy surveys like apm ( e.g. maddox @xcite ) or cosmos ( e.g. heydon - dumbleton @xcite ) , but is well calibrated ( within @xmath29  mag , thanks to a high density of photometric standards ) .",
    "the completeness for galaxies is expected to be better than a conservative 90% at least for @xmath30 .",
    "brighter than this , there might be some loss due to inaccurate star - galaxy separation , and underestimation of fluxes ( @xmath29  mag ) because of photographic saturation effects .",
    "positions are accurate within a fraction of arc - second .",
    "this is sufficient for identifying faint iras sources , which have typical positional uncertainties of a fraction of arcminute .      as for the infrared statistics presented in the previous sections , extreme caution",
    "should be taken in interpreting the results of optical identifications .",
    "we do nt know a priori what fraction of _ real _ iras sources can be identified , especially given the large errors in @xmath31 at our flux level . here again , we addressed this question using a monte - carlo method , by simulating a sample of identified optical counterparts to the artificial sample described in  [ chap : simul ] .",
    "we first assigned some random optical luminosity to each infrared `` monte - carlo '' galaxy with theoretical flux received on earth @xmath32  mjy , according to a suitable optical/60  distribution .",
    "this is an easier task than it may appear , as iras and bright optical galaxy catalogs do have an overlap large enough so that one can build a local , bivariate luminosity function .",
    "the most comprehensive study in that field was done by saunders ( @xcite ) , who proposed a gaussian distribution of the blue absolute luminosity , with standard deviation @xmath33 and mean @xmath34 note that the original expression contains a sign error .",
    "@xmath35 normally refers here to a @xmath36 magnitude , which corresponds almost to our @xmath25 magnitude system ( paper i ) as we drop the average correction for internal extinction @xmath37 ( rowan - robinson @xcite ) . although ( [ eq : bilf ] ) is based on limited statistics and rather inaccurate optical magnitudes , we believe it does provide a globally correct description of the link between the 60  and blue luminosity functions because : 1 ) relation ( [ eq : bilf ] ) correctly reproduces both the @xmath38 distribution for `` normal '' luminosity sources ( rowan - robinson @xcite , bothun @xcite ) and the `` saturation '' of optical luminosities observed in ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) ( smith @xcite , soifer @xcite ) ; 2 ) integrating over all possible infrared luminosities leads to a blue luminosity function in excellent agreement with recent , local determinations ( e.g. ellis 1996 ) . the bivariate luminosity function based on ( [ eq : lf ] ) and ( [ eq : bilf ] ) is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : bilf ] .",
    "we assume relation ( [ eq : bilf ] ) to hold out to @xmath39 , corresponding to the most distant , luminous galaxies we might detect in numbers both in fir and in the optical .",
    "this obviously supposes a negligible evolution of their dust content over the corresponding period of time .",
    "we shall tackle this point in  [ chap : discu ] .      in order to give the right optical @xmath40-corrections to our simulated iras sources",
    ", one has to make some general assumption about their optical / uv spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "the large majority of iras galaxies contained in fir flux - limited samples are spirals ( e.g. de jong @xcite ) , with average morphological type sbc ( bothun @xcite , sauvage & thuan @xcite ) .",
    "although their rest - frame optical colours span a considerable range , it is difficult to find an obvious trend with fir luminosity ( leech @xcite , @xcite , hutchings & neff @xcite ) .",
    "an sbc sed also proves to reproduce satisfactorily the observed optical continuum of 1.4-ghz sub - mjy starburst galaxies with @xmath41 ( benn @xcite ) .",
    "given the tight correlation existing between radio - continuum and far - infrared galaxy luminosities ( de jong @xcite , helou @xcite ) , @xmath42 , these sources are representative of the faintest ones we might detect in our 60  sample .",
    "we have therefore adopted the sbc sed from pence ( @xcite ) to compute optical @xmath40-corrections through our @xmath25 and @xmath26 passbands , and the average sbc @xmath43 typical rest - frame colour from paper i. we will find in  [ chap : colour ] other arguments justifying this choice .",
    "we finally end up with a large number of artificial sources having in addition to their `` unbiased '' @xmath31 fluxes , @xmath25 and @xmath26 magnitudes that could directly go through the same complex ir detection and optical identification processes , as real galaxies .      because of the low resolution of iras images ( @xmath44 at 60 ) , the reliability of the identification technique is crucial for finding the right optical counterparts to faint infrared sources .",
    "this is even more critical here , because of the particularly low infrared s / n and optical faintness for most of the candidates .",
    "we have adopted the likelihood - ratio method , inherited from radio - source identification programs ( de  ruiter @xcite , prestage & peacock @xcite ) , which was successfully applied in previous iras studies ( wolstencroft @xcite,@xcite , sutherland & saunders @xcite ) .",
    "the positional uncertainty of an iras detection is essentially a function of the local reconstructed iras point spread function and the s / n . assuming the error distribution is roughly gaussian , this defines the traditional error ellipses around the estimated object position , described by the @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 ; respectively the  error along the major axis ( cross - scan ) , the  error along the minor axis ( in - scan ) , and position angle .",
    "switching to the reduced coordinate : @xmath48 we can express the probability for the true optical counterpart to lie between @xmath49 and @xmath50 as @xmath51 where q is the probability for the infrared detection to exist and to be detectable in the optical catalogue . in order to check that this modeling fits the data correctly , we derived maximum - likelihood estimates of @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 from optical identifications of the brightest infrared sources ( @xmath52(60)@xmath53  jy ) .",
    "we were able to recover the catalogue values within 10 - 20% .",
    "of course , this does not mean that the modeling is _ adequate_. there is indeed some evidence that the wings of the positional error distribution are larger than gaussian ones ( e.g. sutherland & saunders @xcite ) ; we will quantify the consequences of this effect in the next section .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eldistrib ] , the gaussian model proves to fit correctly the distribution of optically bright ( @xmath54 ) counterparts in our catalogue .",
    "one can however already detect a slight excess ( @xmath55% of the total ) of identifications at about @xmath56 along the cross - scan direction .",
    "equation ( [ eq : prid ] ) defines the probability density for a genuine identification to lie around the iras detection",
    ". we can compare it to the probability of encountering by chance an optical object of class @xmath57 , brighter than magnitude @xmath58 between @xmath49 and @xmath50 : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the projected density of optical objects with class @xmath57 brighter than @xmath58 .",
    "this leads to the likelihood ratio definition from wolstencroft ( @xcite ) : @xmath61 sutherland & saunders ( @xcite ) stressed that @xmath62 is independent of the number of optical candidates lying in the error ellipse .",
    "some extra information can be gained from the presence or absence of these other candidates if one assumes that the true optical counterpart to the infrared source is unique .",
    "however , this hypothesis is dangerous for iras galaxies , because of the non - negligible fraction of multiple systems optically identified ( e.g. gallimore & keel @xcite ) . besides",
    ", the artificial and real optical galaxy samples do not have the same density of `` background '' galaxies , as the first one comes from an infrared flux - limited sample : any estimator that combines information from the other optical detections is likely to behave differently in both cases .",
    "we therefore conformed to the `` standard '' likelihood ratio @xmath62 as an _ individual _ identification estimator for optical candidates .    for every iras detection lying within the area of our optical catalog , likelihood ratios @xmath63 associated to every potential optical candidate",
    "were obtained in the following way .",
    "first , we estimated the @xmath64 separately for stars ( @xmath65 ) and galaxies ( @xmath66 ) from the number counts relative to the current plate .",
    "then we defined a circular zone with a 3  radius around each iras position .",
    "this corresponds to a large confidence interval for @xmath49 : at least @xmath67 , or a diameter 3 times larger than the iras beam fwhm .",
    "finally , the @xmath63 were computed using ( [ eq : lrdef ] ) for all optical detections within the circular zone .",
    "the same procedure was applied to the artificial optical sample around detections in the simulated 60  images , but this time using @xmath68 , which provides a good fit to our integrated galaxy number counts per square degree ( paper i ) .",
    "the sizes of the `` artificial '' error ellipses were computed with formulae ( ii.f.5 ) and ( ii.f.6 ) in moshir ( @xcite ) , assuming the number of scans to be @xmath69 , and a background noise of 30.2 mjy .      what _ real _ fraction of infrared sources possess one or more optical counterparts ?",
    "using the individual likelihood ratios @xmath63 , we can define a global estimator @xmath70 for each iras detection , from which we will derive an identification ratio . here again , we need to be able to compare statistics done with different densities of contaminating sources . for this reasons ,",
    "we have chosen @xmath71 though it might certainly be less effective for multiple sources than , e.g. @xmath72 . in the presence of contamination by `` chance '' optical objects ,",
    "the observed probability for @xmath70 [ as defined by ( [ eq : cali ] ) ] to exceed some threshold @xmath73 for an infrared detection reads : @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the probabilities to have @xmath77 because of real and fortuitous optical identifications , respectively .",
    "thus @xmath78 @xmath79 can be measured by putting error ellipses at random positions in both real and artificial catalogs , which then enables us to compare the real identification rates @xmath80 .",
    "figure [ fig : idrate ] shows @xmath80 as a function of the 60  flux , for @xmath81 ( which proves to be a good compromise between completeness and reliability ) . although they do not enable us to choose between the models , these statistics seem to indicate that the faintest infrared sources can not be attributed to a large number of unexpected `` noise peaks '' . another interesting result is the rather low identification rate predicted by simulations at high s / n : about 80% .",
    "this in good agreement with the observations , and the @xmath82% identification rates reported for the fsc ( sutherland @xcite , wolstencroft @xcite ) , once the differences in the sizes of error ellipses and the addition of chance identifications have been accounted for .",
    "an examination of the simulated fss images reveals that the unidentified sources are produced by confusion with close neighbours in projection .",
    "because of the large width of the iras beam , the barycenter of some detections can be shifted by a few pixels , i.e. @xmath83 or more at high s / n , adding a a long tail to the gaussian error distribution . for these detections , the measured likelihood ratio of the optical counterpart(s )",
    "is thus very close to zero .",
    "we conclude that this phenomenon might be responsible of most of the high s / n unidentified point - sources in the fsc .",
    "note that cirrus sources do also constitute potential deflection factors .",
    "the colour distribution for all identifications with @xmath84 ( roughly a 10% contamination ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : colmag ] , together with the average colour tracks produced by the differential @xmath40-corrections computed with the pence ( @xcite ) seds . for clarity ,",
    "only the no - evolution model is plotted .",
    "the @xmath85 models yields tracks very similar to those of the no - evolution model , which is normal as eq .",
    "( [ eq : bilf ] ) provides very little evolution in optical luminosity for luminous fir sources .",
    "the dispersion in colours appears to be substantially smaller than for an optically limited sample , and as can be seen , the bulk of the iras population follows quite closely the sbc track , supporting our choice in ",
    "[ chap : kcorr ] to adopt an sbc type for the average optical @xmath40-correction .",
    "we now turn to comparing the magnitude distribution with model predictions .",
    "once again , we have to subtract the contribution from fortuitous detections .",
    "one can decompose the total observed number of identifications per magnitude bin at magnitude @xmath58 , @xmath86 , as @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the number of real counterparts and @xmath89 the number of fortuitous optical galaxies in the same magnitude interval .",
    "@xmath90 represents the contribution from iras sources for which both real and fortuitous identifications can occur ( with probability @xmath91 ) .",
    "we do nt know @xmath90 , but we can safely bracket it between the two extreme cases : @xmath92 the lower bound corresponds to the case where the magnitude bin is totally depleted by the presence of the two `` competitors '' , and the higher bound corresponds to the case where there is no depletion at all .",
    "the true value is quite probably intermediate .",
    "inserting @xmath90 in ( [ eq : nm ] ) we get @xmath93 the magnitude distribution of iras sources with @xmath94 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : magdis ] , together with model predictions , for two 60  flux domains . as expected from the evolution models , excess sources",
    "are found on the dim side of the histogram .",
    "a very good agreement is found for @xmath95 , but like the identification rate statistics , they do not put further constraints to the exact amount of evolution .",
    "although they can not be considered as really independent one from each other , the results of the four statistical tests described above ( background fluctuations , number counts , identification rate and magnitude distribution ) do provide a picture remarkably consistent with the phenomenological @xmath96 evolution model , with @xmath95 .",
    "the most stringent test is given by the number counts with @xmath97 down to 0.15 jy , with some indication of a stronger evolution below 0.2 jy .",
    "however , the fluctuation analysis indicates that @xmath17 can not increase much beyond @xmath14 below 0.1 jy . as indicated earlier , a pure density evolution yields a similarly good fit to the data , with a comoving density evolving as @xmath2 down to 0.15 jy .",
    "these values are in good agreement with the value found on shallower surveys by saunders ( @xcite ) who found @xmath98  although according to some authors , e.g. fisher @xcite or oliver @xcite , this number might largely be affected by biases  , and oliver ( @xcite ) with @xmath99 .",
    "however they do _ a priori _ rule out the extreme evolution discovered by gregorich ( @xcite ) in their iras number counts .",
    "in particular , their high density of faint sources is incompatible with our background fluctuation analysis .",
    "a check done on the gregorich ( @xcite ) fields reveals that they contain cirrus , which might produce a large fraction of false detections , and should also contribute significantly to the total background noise and its associated eddington bias .",
    "strong cirrus emission also affects the hacking & houck ( @xcite ) deep field , but the dispersion in their scanning angles smoothes considerably edge - effects on cirrus structures .",
    "this might explain why their counts are in better agreement with ours .",
    "our counts and those from previous studies are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : corcounts ] .",
    "our statistics probes mainly the evolution of infrared luminous galaxies ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "the good fits given to the data by the @xmath101 model , and the large excess of faint optical counterparts indicate that luminous iras galaxies should be @xmath1025 - 7  times more numerous at @xmath103 than at the present time .",
    "what are these galaxies ? according to our monte - carlo model , the optical counterparts with @xmath104 should have an average 60   luminosity @xmath105 and should be at a redshift @xmath103 , in agreement with their rather red colours @xmath106 , if their optical continuum is close to that of local sbc s .",
    "these are therefore potential ultraluminous infrared ( ulirgs ) candidates .",
    "this picture is consistent with the redshift distribution of the optically faint ulirgs surveyed by clements ( @xcite ) .",
    "objects with brighter optical counterparts ( @xmath107 ) have naturally a lower fir excess , but most are still _ redder _ than the average population in the same magnitude domain .",
    "they are very probably similar to the population of starburst spirals with @xmath108 optical luminosities identified in the sub - millijansky radio surveys ( benn @xcite , windhorst @xcite ) , although at smaller redshifts ( @xmath1090.1 - 0.2 ) . hence it seems unlikely that a large fraction of the detected excess of faint 60  sources at the 100 mjy level might be caused by dust - enriched primeval galaxies , as suggested by franceschini ( @xcite ) .",
    "wang ( @xcite , @xcite ) proposed a pure fir - luminosity evolution scenario based on the evolution of dust content in normal galaxies .",
    "although some variants of this model might be able to predict a significant increase of fir luminosity in galaxies over the few past gyr , they rely on the assumption that emitters are optically thin at blue / uv wavelengths .",
    "this is certainly not the case for most of fir - luminous galaxies ( the sole population of galaxies that can be detected by iras at significant redshifts )",
    ". as these objects already have @xmath110 , adding more dust should not be very effective in increasing their fir luminosities ( e.g. belfort @xcite ) .",
    "therefore a moderate change in the dust content of galaxies since @xmath103 should not be a major contributor to the evolution observed yet for iras galaxies .",
    "the evolution rate of luminous iras galaxies is in remarkable agreement with those of qsos ( e.g. boyle @xcite ) or x - ray selected active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ( e.g. maccacaro @xcite ) , which brings up the link between agn and ulirgs , as most of the latter may harbour agns ( e.g. sanders @xcite ) . an important question is therefore : does the evolution concern the global fir - luminous galaxy population , or is it limited to `` monsters '' containing active nuclei ?",
    "the magnitude distribution in our faintest 60  flux bin ( fig .",
    "[ fig : magdis ] ) seems to indicate that most of the sources found in excess are not ulirgs , and consequently , according to local statistics ( leech @xcite ) , are less likely to contain an agn .",
    "a stronger argument against a sample dominated by agns may come from spectroscopic identifications of sub - millijansky radio - sources ( benn @xcite ) , which , as we saw , can be compared to our sample , and has proven to contain a minority of agn - like spectra .",
    "extreme caution should however be made in interpreting these spectra , as optical signatures of a central engine might be hidden by the large amounts of dust present in the nuclear regions of such objects ( see e.g. dennefeld @xcite ) .",
    "deep number counts conducted at visible wavelengths have revealed a large excess of faint galaxies over the no - evolution predictions from @xmath111 cosmological models ( tyson @xcite , colless @xcite , lilly @xcite , metcalfe @xcite , @xcite , smail @xcite ) , as well as a blueing of the global population with fainter magnitudes .",
    "the @xmath112 redshift distributions obtained from spectroscopic surveys are however apparently in good agreement with no - evolution models , which suggests a diminution or a fading with time of low and moderate luminosity members of the blue galaxy population since @xmath113 ( broadhurst @xcite , lilly @xcite , ellis @xcite , driver @xcite ) . various scenarios to explain this observational phenomenon",
    "have been proposed , including a delayed formation epoch of dwarf galaxies ( babul & rees @xcite , babul & ferguson @xcite ) , decimation through intense merging ( guiderdoni & rocca - volmerange @xcite , broadhurst @xcite ) , or more prosaically , biases in the determination of the local luminosity function ( davies @xcite , mcgaugh @xcite , gronwall & koo @xcite ) .    now , strong evolution among the spiral population , apparently seen at fir and radio wavelengths , is a tempting argument for hypotheses advocating recent evolution of the optical lf .",
    "evolution in fir is detected in redshift surveys of iras samples ( saunders @xcite , oliver @xcite ) and could be explained , for example , through an increasing rate with @xmath114 of galaxy - galaxy interactions , which are known to be efficient triggers of starburst activity ( e.g. larson & tinsley @xcite ) , or agns ( sanders @xcite ) .",
    "there are indeed both theoretical ( toomre @xcite , carlberg @xcite ) and observational ( zepf & koo @xcite , burkey @xcite , carlberg @xcite ) evidences for such a rapid increase with redshift of the merging rate , at least to @xmath115 .",
    "a few attempts have been made to link a strong , starburst - driven , evolution of the fir luminosity function to that of the optical ( lonsdale & harmon @xcite , lonsdale & chokshi @xcite , pearson & rowan - robinson @xcite ) .",
    "they involved simple proportionality between the optical and fir evolution ( either in density or luminosity ) and therefore predicted a large increase in the comoving space density of optically bright ( @xmath116 ) galaxies with redshift , which is unfortunately not seen at @xmath117 .",
    "the same problem arises with stellar population synthesis models applied to starburst - driven evolution ( e.g. carlberg & charlot @xcite ) .    but this apparent contradiction could be alleviated by remarking that the possibly large increase of blue continuum emission resulting from starburst activity is often largely _ hidden _ at blue / uv wavelengths in fir luminous galaxies .",
    "it is a fact that the complex role of dust , and in particular its geometry with respect to the stars , has been ignored in many models trying to reproduce number counts with starburst - evolution . in massive spirals , star - formation induced by merging",
    "is generally concentrated in the central regions of the galaxy ( e.g. hummel @xcite , condon @xcite , bushouse @xcite ) .",
    "such a feature is likely to originate from radial inflow of disk gas triggered by the interaction , and is well reproduced in numerical simulations ( e.g. hernquist @xcite , minhos & hernquist @xcite ) .",
    "the associated circumnuclear starburst ( which may surround an agn ) is usually heavily reddened in the optical , and does not increase so much the total blue / uv light output of the galaxy : ulirgs are rarely `` ultraluminous '' at visible wavelengths ( as reflected by relation [ eq : bilf ] ) .",
    "on the contrary , starbursts in field dwarf galaxies , dominated by gas - rich , dust - deficient late types ( e.g. van den bergh & pierce @xcite , wang & heckman @xcite ) typically show up in optically prominent giant h  ii regions ( e.g. huchra @xcite ) , and are often found to dominate the total blue / uv emission . hence , statistically , starbursts observed in both types of galaxies possess very different observable signatures .",
    "therefore the hypothesis that starburst galaxies which dominate iras faint number counts are the same as those that make the excess seen in the optical at intermediate redshifts ( pearson & rowan - robinson @xcite ) is not convincing .",
    "there is nevertheless evidence from optical redshift surveys that the galaxies with @xmath118 observed in excess at @xmath119 are actively star - forming galaxies ( ellis @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "recent studies have estimated their evolution in terms of global brightening at blue wavelengths between now and @xmath120 to @xmath121  mag ( driver @xcite , rix @xcite ) , similar to what we inferred for iras galaxies in fir .",
    "is the evolution of fir - luminous galaxies closely related to that of faint blue galaxies ? in the hypothesis of a recent evolution dominated by starburst processes in both populations , this question is essentially linked to the existence of a common triggering mechanism , in which case we may consider iras galaxies as massive , dusty versions of the faint blue galaxies .",
    "although interaction / merging seems to be the rule among distant iras galaxies , at least for the most luminous members ( clements @xcite,@xcite ) , the situation is much less clear for faint blue galaxies .",
    "hubble space telescope _",
    "images present visual evidence for a high proportion of interacting / merging objects , increasing steeply with magnitude ( driver @xcite , van  den  bergh @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , many of these sources may well be luminous galaxies at much higher redshifts , or in some cases , knots of star - formation observed in single objects . besides , optical observations of nearby dwarf galaxies undergoing starbursts reveal that a large fraction are apparently isolated objects ( campos - aguilar & moles @xcite , telles & terlevich @xcite ) , which argues against interactions as a unique triggering mechanism of starburst activity at recent epochs .",
    "still , one can not exclude the hypothesis of interactions or collisions with hi clouds , supported by 21  cm observations of the environment of nearby hii galaxies ( taylor @xcite ) .",
    "another test of the interaction scenario might be provided by studying the spatial ( or angular ) two - point correlation function .",
    "one could expect the distribution of sources triggered by interactions to exhibit some differences with respect to the global ( late - type ) density field .",
    "in fact both iras and blue galaxies happen to have clustering properties barely distinguishable , within measurement errors , from their common parent population of late - type galaxies ( e.g. infante & pritchet @xcite , mann @xcite , oliver @xcite ) , although this may not be true at very small scales ( carlberg @xcite , infante @xcite ) .",
    "we shall therefore conclude this discussion by pointing out that a simple and appealing scenario , in which the strong , recent evolution among late - type galaxies at moderate redshifts is related to an increase of the merging / interaction rate with lookback time , appears qualitatively compatible with the observations . in this scenario",
    ", fir - luminous galaxies would then represent the massive , dusty counterparts of faint starbursting blue galaxies .",
    "more data are clearly necessary to test this hypothesis on the observational side , under others to follow the evolution of the intermediate luminosity population in the fir",
    ". this should be possible with the iso ( _ infrared space observatory _ ) satellite .",
    "it would also allow to assess more accurately the evidence for strong evolution at low redshifts in the fir , deduced so far only from iras measurements .",
    "we have analysed a deep homogeneous 60  subsample of galaxies , at the lowest flux limit reached by the iras faint source survey , yielding the following results :    \\1 .",
    "detection and measurement biases were assessed through monte - carlo simulations , which prove to reproduce satisfactorily most observed features of detected iras sources at 60 . in particular , the rather high proportion of unidentified sources in the fsc ( @xmath122% ) can totally be accounted for by deflections caused by neighbouring ir sources .",
    "sources in excess are genuine and are generally associated with faint , relatively red , optical counterparts which we interpret as being @xmath5 massive starbursting galaxies at redshifts @xmath123 .",
    "photometric properties of distant iras galaxies suggest that the advocated starbursts ( or agns ) are considerably hidden by dust at uv / visible wavelengths , which would explain why no large number of related optically luminous objects is showing up in optical surveys at @xmath124 .",
    "faint iras galaxies in excess are unlikely to be the ones making the excess in number counts at blue wavelengths and @xmath124 , but this does not exclude that both populations follow the same evolution mechanism ( i.e. interaction - induced starbursts ) .    the authors wish to thank a. fruscione for her contribution during an earlier phase of the project , and c. lidman for helpful comments on the manuscript .",
