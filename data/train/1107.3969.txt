    "<S> based on the available @xmath0 photometry of ob stars in the longitude range @xmath1 to @xmath2 in the galactic disk , we identify a feature of young stars at 1630@xmath3 pc , that is probably connected to the compact cluster candidate lodn 112 and the open cluster ic 2581 . </S>",
    "<S> this feature seems to be spatially correlated to rcw 48 and rcw 49 and several other smaller hii regions . </S>"
